During the SARS outbreak in late February 2003, it was one the designated centers receiving referrals from emergency departments and the department of health. A retrospective study was undertaken in the department of medicine and geriatrics of the hospital to evaluate the clinical course of young and elderly SARS patients. The enrollment period began from February 22, 2003, when the first index case in Hong Kong was admitted to the hospital and ended on May 31, 2003. All adult inpatients who met the criteria for a modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS were included (Table 1). Laboratory evidence of CoV infection was not a prerequisite for inclusion. This included nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate, urine and stool samples for reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) for SARS\u2010CoV, and serological tests for SARS\u2010CoV immunoglobulin G antibody.\n7\n Positive serological test was defined as a single titer above 1:100, seroconversion, or a fourfold increase in antibody titers in paired serum samples over a period of 21 to 28 days. Because these tests were not widely available until April 2003, patients who were admitted early or died rapidly during the outbreak did not undergo such investigations. Most of the others were routinely tested for RT\u2010PCR and CoV antibody. Microbiological tests were also performed to exclude other established causes for community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP). These included bacterial cultures of sputum, blood, and urine; serological tests for mycoplasma, chlamydia, legionella, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus; nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate for rapid antigen testing of influenza; sputum for acid\u2010fast bacillus smear; and culture for mycobacteria.",

Demographic data, clinical features, concomitant illnesses, and contact history were documented. Contact history was defined as exposure to a case within 10 days before presentation of symptoms. Contact history was further classified into hospital contact, family contact, and community contact. Hospital contact was defined as history of visiting a hospital, being hospitalized, or working in a hospital within the 10 days before presentation of symptoms. A dedicated SARS team managed all patients and treated them according to consensus protocols suggested by a local expert panel.\n8\n The initial treatment typically included a combination of a third\u2010 or fourth\u2010generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefepime) and oral macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin). For a patient with a definite contact history, empirical treatment with intravenous ribavirin (8 mg/kg every 8 hours) and hydrocortisone (4 mg/kg every 8 hours) was started if clinical conditions had not improved within 2 days. High\u2010resolution computerized tomography scan of the thorax was performed in suspected cases with normal or equivocal chest x\u2010ray findings. Pulse methylprednisolone (500\u20131,000 mg/d for 5 days) was given to patients with rapid clinical and radiological deterioration. Usually ribavirin and corticosteroid were tapered off over a period of 3 weeks, and oral treatment began when clinical condition stabilized. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was in general restricted to patients who required mechanical ventilation and patients with a fair to good premorbid functional state.",

This study confirmed that presentations of SARS in older adults resembled other forms of CAP. There were significantly fewer older adults who presented initially with fever and chills, whereas the atypical complaints, including decreased appetite and general condition, occurred only in older individuals. Symptoms of SARS in geriatric patients could also be manifested as orthopedic complications.\n10\n An elderly woman developed respiratory failure after a recent operation for hip fracture, and an autopsy later showed typical findings of SARS. Diarrhea occurred in 20% of younger patients and 4% of older patients. The former incidence was comparable with findings from several large local studies reporting diarrhea in 11% to 19.6% of SARS patients.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n11\n It is unclear why older adults have less diarrhea. Because the proportion of patients with positive RT\u2010PCR in stool samples was similar in two groups, fewer older patients with diarrhea probably represents a generalized paucity of symptoms rather than a different site of involvement by SARS\u2010CoV.",

A lack of fever may imply an impaired immune response to infection, although it may not be ominous at all times. An elderly patient who had clinical, radiological, and laboratory features of SARS was excluded from the study because fever was never documented. She remained well with only empirical oral ribavirin treatment and might have represented a mild form of SARS\u2010CoV infection. It is important to recognize these patients with nonspecific symptoms and without fever for infection control reasons during an epidemic. Outbreaks in the hospital have been reported in healthcare workers who contracted SARS when managing unsuspected infected patients in general wards.\n13\n\n",

The prevalence of positive RT\u2010PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool samples was 51% and 37%, respectively. Two large local studies reported that the positivity rates for RT\u2010PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirate were 65% and 36%, whereas the positivity rate in stool samples was 71% in one series.\n5\n, \n11\n Selection bias in patients and variation in sampling time are the most likely reasons to account for the discrepancy. In one study, only 24% of SARS patients had RT\u2010PCR in stool samples examined, in contrast to more than 90% of patients in the current study. In the current study, similar proportions of young and older patients with SARS had RT\u2010PCR performed, and comparable positivity rates were achieved.

This was largely due to incomplete testing, especially in patients who died quickly. More than half of the deaths in older patients occurred within 2 to 3 weeks after admission, although seroconversion may not be detected until 21 to 28 days after onset of illness. In addition, there was an interval between symptom onset and admission. Some of the patients might have paired serological tests completed in less than 21 days from admission. Seroconversion might occur at a later time in these patients. However, there were three older patients in whom serological tests remained negative after 21 days (mean 33 days). This may be related to a genuine lack of immune response. Aging is associated with a qualitative decline in T\u2010cell function and integrity of helper T cells is essential in the process of antibody production.\n14\n A decline and delay in the antibody response to influenza vaccination has also been demonstrated in elderly subjects.\n15\n An antibody response to SARS\u2010CoV at 21 to 28 day may not be useful in older adults with SARS.

The 30\u2010 and 150\u2010day mortality rates in patients aged older than 60 with SARS were 56% and 60%, respectively, in this cohort. Such findings were similar to an estimated fatality rate of 43.3% (95% confidence interval=35.2\u201352.4) suggested by some researchers.\n3\n Because there were few late deaths, the current study demonstrated that SARS is an acute illness with high immediate mortality in the elderly population. Several large studies have shown that advanced age is the most consistent and powerful independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in SARS patients,\n4\n, \n5\n, \n11\n but age by itself was not a prognostic indicator related to mortality in a group of older adults with CAP after adjustment of confounders.\n12\n Moreover, in one recent large series, the reported crude fatality rate for older adults (\u226565) with CAP was only 12.5%.\n16\n Another prospective study evaluating a group of old patients (mean age 83) with CAP showed that the fatality rate was 31%.\n17\n The causes for an excessive fatality rate of more than 50% in elderly SARS patients are not known. SARS\u2010CoV may be particularly virulent in older adults, but this remains to be proven. Alternatively, elderly patients may be more susceptible to the side effects of ribavirin and high\u2010dose corticosteroids that were used as empirical treatment in a majority of patients with SARS in Hong Kong. Because most of the studies on SARS were undertaken retrospectively, the incidence and consequence of adverse effects related to these medications are unknown. It has been suggested that ribavirin might be beneficial as an immunomodulator despite its modest antiviral activity.\n18\n Systemic use of ribavirin may also cause dose\u2010dependent hemolytic anemia and bone marrow suppression.\n19\n In this study, significant anemia requiring blood transfusion complicated the course in three elderly patients; two of the three patients died. Apart from ribavirin, the majority of SARS patients in Hong Kong also received high\u2010dose corticosteroids. Although previous studies have shown that corticosteroids are effective in clearing consolidative changes in patients with SARS,\n4\n, \n20\n the use of corticosteroids could be detrimental in causing immunosuppression and promoting secondary sepsis. The latter complication can be fatal in older adults, with a majority of the elderly patients with documented nosocomial infection (3/5) dying.",
