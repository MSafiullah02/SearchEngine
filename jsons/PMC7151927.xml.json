The first infection appears as early as the neonatal period. In the absence of resources for rehydration and restoration of electrolyte balance, the diarrhoea may be life-threatening. Rotavirus infections therefore create medical problems particularly in developing countries. Presence of IgA and IgG antibodies in the intestines and the transfer of secretory IgA with the milk from mother to child have been considered essential for recovery and immunity against the rotavirus infections. The importance of passive local immunization via breast-feeding may be an essential argument against artificial feeding in developing countries. Rotavirus is, as mentioned, diagnosed by electron microscopy of faecal specimens or by detection of viral antigens. In serology the antigenic relatedness between animal and human rotaviruses are sometimes utilized. In contrast to human rotavirus, the calf rotaviruses may be grown in cell cultures. Also hybrids between human and calf rotaviruses have been used for, among other reasons, the production of antigens to be used in diagnostic work for detecting rotaviruses.",

A worldwide epidemic with severe acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis was associated with enterovirus 70 but coxsackie A 24 has also been incriminated with haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Necrotic changes of the cornea with scarring or ulcers may follow eye infections with herpes simplex virus. If untreated this infection may lead to perforation and an iridocyclitis with blindness. A similarly serious course may result from a zoster ophthalmicus affecting sclerae and cornea. Furthermore, one of the herpesviruses, CMV, may induce congenital eye infections as well as an acquired haemorrhagic retinits later in life.
