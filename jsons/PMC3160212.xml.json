The current review shows that estrogen increases susceptibility to certain viral infections associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. To find material for the review, the author retrieved information from Pubmed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/). Literature searches first focused on studies that described the effects of estrogen on viral infections. Additional searches then located information on how estrogen relates to other risk factors for schizophrenia including autoimmune diseases, urban environments, and stress.",

The author's theory is that prenatal exposure to inappropriate estrogen causes schizophrenia even though estrogen supplementation reduces some symptoms of schizophrenia later in adult life.2 Neuroprotection by estrogen in adults may result in milder forms of schizophrenia observed in females compared with males3 but does not relate to the increased susceptibility of pregnant women to infection that lies at the core of viral theories of schizophrenia.",

These effects provide a mechanism for the commonly cited increased susceptibility to viral infections during pregnancy.5 In urogenital infections, estrogen reduces cell-mediated immunity in humans.4 In RNA virus infections, estrogen reduces human dendritic cell immune responses and stimulation of CD4 T-cell immune responses and inhibits type 1 interferon.5 Estrogen's inhibition of dendritic cell maturation has important implications for schizophrenia. Through this mechanism, estrogen could increase vulnerability to more than one RNA virus associated with increased risk of schizophrenia including borna disease virus,6 mumps,7 influenza,8 and coronaviruses.9",

Supporting this view are animal research models of schizophrenia that combine stress and genetic susceptibility.33 Furthermore, stress responses are modulated in the limbic portion of the brain by estrogen's effect on the estrogen receptors (ERs) ER-alpha and ER-beta.34 Plasma estrogen levels in male rats are also under genetic control, as shown by Lewis rats in which stress increases plasma estrogen and in Fischer rats in which stress decreases plasma estrogen.35",

The discussion above described how increased estrogen could not only explain increased viral infection in schizophrenia but also the association of schizophrenia with autoimmune diseases, stress, and urban factors. Based on this and on previous work,1 the author proposes that inappropriate prenatal estrogen exposure is the unifying pathological characteristic of schizophrenia whether from excessive dose, timing and/or duration of estrogen exposure, and/or modification of estrogen receptor function. As described above, the distribution of ER-alpha and ER-beta was recently described in human cortex and hippocampus from gestation to adulthood.36 A test of the current theory could begin with a comparison of ER-alpha and ER-beta distribution in brains with schizophrenia compared with normal.",
