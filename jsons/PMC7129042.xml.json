Increased insight into prevalence, circulation patterns and clinical significance is not only of importance for surveillance purposes, but also for the future development of antiviral therapy and vaccines. The aim of our study was therefore to investigate the prevalence of RV types in the hospital population of the Academic Medical Centre (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), by genotyping all RV-positive samples submitted for respiratory viral diagnostics from 2007 to 2012.",

The Academic Medical Centre receives mainly samples from the southeast area of Amsterdam. The samples were acquired from hospitalized patients and non-hospitalized patients visiting the outpatient clinics or emergency room. The reason for sampling was not systematically documented on the accompanying form for the laboratory and so could not be adequately monitored or analysed. Respiratory samples collected for research purposes and those that were not tested for RV were excluded from the analyses. A total of 1102 (17.6%) respiratory samples were positive for RV. There was no material available from five samples for additional gene sequencing. All available RV-positive samples were further characterized by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region. The sampling and virological testing were part of routine care and were executed according to hospital ethical guidelines and the Dutch code of conduct for responsible use of human tissue and medical research 2011.",

An analysis including only the first infection of each patient resulted in a similar outcome (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, p 0.002).

In this selected patient population the under-representation of RV-B in our study was retained (chi-square test, p 0.005), indicating that the lower proportion of RV-B infections was not (solely) due to the lower detection of RV-B in the young children.",

We were not able to perform associations between the clinical symptoms of the patients and the different RV types due to the retrospective character of the study and the limited information provided by the clinicians on the accompanying form to the laboratory. Because of the limited clinical information and heterogeneous composition of our study group, we were not able to evaluate the prevalence of various RV types in specific populations. A selection bias is that our study is composed of individuals attending the hospital and therefore might not completely reflect the prevalence of RV types in the general population. Nevertheless, the large variety in RV types in our population points towards continuous variations in RV types co-circulating in the community.",
