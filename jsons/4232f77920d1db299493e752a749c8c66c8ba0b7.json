Notably, many of affected patients of COVID-19 were people with malignancies. Moreover, cancer has been identified as an individual risk factor for COVID-19. In addition, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of COVID-19, were aberrantly expressed in many tumors. However, a systematic analysis of ACE2 aberration remained to be elucidated in human cancers. Here, we analyzed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of ACE2 across over 30 tumors. Notably, overexpression of ACE2 have been observed in including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In addition, hypo DNA methylation of ACE2 has also been identified in most of these ACE2 highly expressed tumors. Conclusively, our study for the first time curated both genetic and epigenetic variations of ACE2 in human malignancies. Notably, because our study is a bioinformatics assay, further functional and clinical validation is warranted.",

Six tumors (COAD, KIRP, PAAD, READ, STAD, and LUAD) presented with elevated ACE2 expression while three other tumors (TGCT, THCA, KICH) presented with decreased ACE2 expression; however, ACE2 expression was not statistically relevant to patients' prognosis, neither in DFS ( Figure S7 ) nor OS ( Figure S8 ). For DFS, higher ACE2 expression predicted better outcome in KIRC, LIHC, LUSC, UCS, and OV groups ( Figure  S9A ). For overall survival, higher ACE2 expression indicated better prognosis in KIRC, LIHC, and OV groups. However, higher ACE2 expression in LGG refers to unfavorable outcome, which indicated the ACE2 might function as a dual-edged sword for patients' outcome ( Figure S9B) . Notably, ACE2 has been proven to be an important regulator in tumorigenesis. For instance, ACE2 inhibits breast cancer angiogenesis through suppressing VEGFa/VEGFR2/ERK pathway [7] and reduces cell invasion and migration in NSCLC cells [8] .",
