This disease has been announced as pandemic by WHO.

This protein (S) consists of a small intracellular tail, a trans-membrane anchor, and a large sized ectodomain composed of receptor-binding S1 subunit, and cell membrane-fusing S2 subunit (2) . S1 subunit initiates the process of viral entry via attaching with cell receptor while S2 subunit facilities the viral fusion with cell membrane (3) . The protein S is cleaved at S2\u2032 by proteases present in host cell (4) leading to the activation of this protein for fusion with cell membrane through a spectrum of permanent conformational modifications (5, 6) . Thus, viral entry is a complicated process depending on combined event of protein S-receptor binding and proteolytic protein S processing (3).",

Since the spike (S) protein is the viral component that with the cleaving action of host proteases facilitates the CoV-2 entry into the host cellular cytoplasm, thus a hypothesis is arises \"could the blocking of viral S1 subunit and inhibiting of proteases simultaneously with host-friendly inhibitors make the CoV-2 handicapped and prevent its complete entry into target cells\". Figure 1 shows the mechanism of CoV-2 entry into target cell. The theoretical model for inhibiting receptor-binding S1and S\u2032-proteases interplay is depicted in Figure 2 . We suggest that S1 subunit and host proteases as potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of COVID-19. Running Title: S1 Subunit as therapeutic target in COVID-19",
