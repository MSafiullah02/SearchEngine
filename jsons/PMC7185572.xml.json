More specifically, we examined the time-course for infectious air travelers to arrive in the United States (U.S.) from international cities with the highest U.S.-bound flight traffic for the month of February. Previous U.S. modeling and planning efforts for point of entry response to pandemic influenza assumed a system-wide \u201call or nothing\u201d initiation of traveler screening, aligned with World Health Organization phases. Temporal and geographical risk-based response stratification was underrepresented in those analyses, while spatial considerations and disease epidemiological characteristics guided most airport response planning. This paper describes a method that would allow for a more flexible approach, which could be applied to threats other than pandemic influenza. We used a traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model20, 21 and an illustrative scheduled-flight dataset, to demonstrate how public health authorities could prioritize the allocation of response-resources in the U.S. at point of entry in response to a novel disease that was spreading rapidly outside of North America.",

The model propagates disease based on population sizes from metropolitan areas using calculations that estimate the dynamics of disease spread within each city and by air travel of individuals from one city to another, as previously described and calibrated by Epstein et al. and Bobashev et al.20, 21 The simulated population is mutually assigned into one of the following disease states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatically infectious (I_s), asymptomatically infectious (I_a), and recovered (R). These disease states are illustrated in Fig. 1\n. A person can move from being susceptible, to exposed, then to either asymptomatically or symptomatically infectious prior to recovery. The model is implemented such that people in the infectious state have a 66.67% chance of being symptomatic and a 33.33% chance of being asymptomatic.18 People who transition to the recovered state would no longer be susceptible and remain in the recovered state for the duration of the simulation. Unlike prior implementation of this model, people in the infectious states were disallowed from entering a dead state in part to maximize person-to-person spread in the early stages of a pandemic and to create an upper boundary for this modeling study. As such the case-fatality proportion was intentionally set to zero.",

Database extraction included origins and destinations from 272 airports in 177 metropolitan areas (Supplemental Table S4). Weekly seats for flights between different airports in the same city pair were combined. If the summed seats between a city pair differed in directionality, the average seat counts were applied. Weekly seat counts were converted to daily seat counts and then multiplied by 70% to obtain enplanement estimates for all city pairs. The 70% load factor is consistent with information reported by the Bureau of Transportation and Statistics for the average of scheduled and non-scheduled flights (http://www.bts.gov). The flight matrix used in this study is available upon request. Since this study focused on forecasting and predictions, best available scheduled flight data were used, with the understanding that not all flights into the U.S. were recorded in scheduled flight databases (e.g., chartered flights and unscheduled flights were not represented).",

Rather, we used Mexico City as a proxy for the village of La Gloria, Veracruz, Mexico, from where some of the earliest pH1N1 cases were reported.3 In addition, we replicated the mean U.S. incidence rate of 0.997%, as reported by the CDC for pH1N1 cases in the U.S. between April and July 23, 200933 based on the U.S. cities used in the model (listed in Supplemental Table 2). In order to replicate the mean incidence rate of 0.997%, we evaluated two parameters: 1) The basic reproduction number, which represents a measure of the average number of people in a totally susceptible population to whom one infected individual transmits a disease, was allowed to vary between 1.4 and 1.7 in increments of 0.01. 2) The number of days it takes the model to predict the targeted mean incidence rate which best matches July 23, 2009, i.e., the 165th day after Feb 15th, 2009. We confirmed that our model generated a U.S. incidence rate of 1.0482% (standard deviation of 0.0067%) on the 165th day after disease onset for an R\n0 of 1.53; these parameters are very close to the reported mean incidence rate of 0.997% by July 23, 2009. An R\n0 of 1.53 is well within published estimates of R\n0 for the 2009 pH1N1 which ranged from 1.4 to 1.6.3, 34\n",

The spread of disease during travel from infectious passengers to susceptible passengers was not modeled separately from spread in the general population. Variation in travel based on seasonality was not included and thus the analysis presented in this study only applies to a disease that spread in the month of February 2009 based on travel in that month. Finally, this approach neglects travel between cities that does not take place via nonstop flights on the same day \u2013 in particular, connecting flights through gateway cities, or non-aviation means such as car or train for nearby cities such as Paris, France, and Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
