So far, the main risk factors of COVID-19-related deaths include oldness, increasing counts of neutrophil, D-dimer, and decreasing counts of lymphocyte [12, 13]. In fact, several clinical observational studies have found that COVID-19 patients had lower counts of platelet [8, 9, 12, 14\u201316]. Recently, a meta-analysis reported that thrombocytopenia was associated with severe COVID-19 [17]. However, the relationship between decreasing counts of platelet and prognosis in COVID-19 patients is unknown.

Therefore, platelet count can act as a sensitive indicator of illness severity and shows early changes in conditions, indirectly reflecting the body\u2019s ability to resist the disease. Recent studies reported that the lungs of COVID-19 patients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage, which was very similar to those found in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [27]. There were several reasons why the platelets of COVID-19 patients declined in the early stages. On the one hand, viral infection induced lung tissue damage, resulting in activation, aggregation, and entrapment of the platelet. This led to thrombosis at the lung injury site, which increased the consumption of platelet. On the other hand, mature megakaryocytes may release platelets in the lungs. Therefore, when the damaged lungs caused pulmonary fibrosis and pathological changes, production of platelet might be affected [28]. Furthermore, virus infection may bring about immune damages to platelets by inducing auto-antibodies and immune complexes. The use of immunomodulators and short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose may potentially be helpful for critically ill patients with COVID-19, using, essentially, very personalized attitude towards each particular patient.",

What\u2019s more, a downward trend of platelet count is more informative than whether it is within the normal range. The blood routine test is easy to carry out and it is inexpensive.
