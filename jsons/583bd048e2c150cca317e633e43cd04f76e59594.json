The concluding sections of this review address the potential use of convalescent plasma during the present-day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only insofar as its clinical benefit but also the steps required to make convalescent plasma treatments readily available for an exponentially growing patient population. By the end, the authors hope to address the extent to which convalescent plasma represents a realistic therapeutic approach, or a distraction from other potentially useful treatments.",

In terms of neutralizing antibodies, the majority (75%) of plasma donors had low titers (1:10 -1:40) and only a minority (5%) had high titers (1:160).

Ninety-two patients received high-titer plasma while 48 received low titer plasma. No benefit in high titer plasma over low titer plasma was found. In fact, the study was terminated early when it was determined that even if the planned full 150 participants were recruited, the high-titer group would still show no improvement in clinical status over low titer J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f plasma. Of note, 34% of the subjects experienced serious adverse events including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and allergic transfusion reactions, which highlight the potential hazards of convalescent plasma.

Concentrating for neutralizing activity may also mitigate potential viral antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), a process in which plasma antibodies exacerbate disease by enhancing viral cell entry and viral replication by various mechanisms, some of which have been described in MERS infectious model. 53, 54 Theoretically, ADE could exacerbate COVID-19 infection in patients who receive convalescent plasma from donors who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the administration of passive J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f antibodies can suppress the recipient's humoral immune system from generating pathogenspecific antibodies thereby leaving an individual susceptible to reinfection. 55 Of course, there is the rare but non-zero risk of transfusion transmitted infections.",

Notwithstanding the shortage of high-quality evidence and the moderate to high biases in the SARS-CoV-1 study designs, a metanalysis of 8 of these studies demonstrated a benefit in mortality following convalescent plasma transfusion. 37 Another coronavirus responsible for human infection is the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea resulted in a few case reports and series that failed to show clinical improvement with the administration of convalescent plasma. 38,39 However, one study found that donor plasma containing higher titers of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody resulted in seroconversion of the recipient post-transfusion whereas seroconversion was not noted when plasma with a low titer of neutralizing antibody was transfused. 40 Granted, data presented therein was only based on 3 patients and a total of 4 convalescent plasma transfusions, so definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. Nonetheless, the study again raises the valid consideration of quality of convalescent plasma and the role neutralizing antibody titers might play.",

Duan and colleagues, present a series of 10 severely ill COVID-19 who all received one 200 mL transfusion of convalescent plasma with high titers of neutralizing antibody (>1:640) at a median of 16.5 days. 46 The primary endpoint in this study was safety, which was demonstrated as all patients tolerated plasma transfusion without severe adverse events. The secondary endpoints Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f included amelioration of clinical symptoms and improvement in laboratory values by day 3 post transfusion. They reported increase neutralizing antibody titer, oxygen saturation, and lymphocyte count; and decrease in C-reactive protein, SARS-Cov-2 viral load, and lung lesions on radiological examination. Lastly, Zhang et al. describe 4 critically ill patients who were transfused between 200 -2400 mL of convalescent plasma ranging from day 11 to day 18 of admission. 47 All 4 patients were considered recovered from the COVID-19 infection; however, recovery/discharge ranged anywhere from approximately 1 week to 1 month post initial transfusion so the temporal relationship between convalescent plasma and clinical improvement is difficult to reconcile. The definition of recovery is arguable given one patient was discharged on supplemental oxygen and another patient required continued critical care for multi-organ failure, granted the SARS-Cov-2 viral load had decreased and lung lesions resolved on imaging.",

The model exhibited remarkable benefit of convalescent plasma in the setting of COVID-19 infection even at conservative estimates of 25% effectiveness. In other words, the model indicates the risk of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infection coupled with the potential benefit, even if minimal, outweigh the risks of transfusion. Based on the use of convalescent plasma in aforementioned epidemics and pandemics and the conceivable benefit for COVID-19 patients, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of convalescent plasma to treat severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection. 48 Given that efficacy is far from proven, the FDA is calling for clinical trials to investigate administration of convalescent plasma in the setting of COVID-19. Accordingly, the FDA is urging physicians to submit investigational new drug (IND) applications. 49 Per FDA stipulations, plasma collected from recovered COVID-19 patients must have a negative SARS-CoV-2 test and must be symptom free for 14 days. Donors must also meet the eligibility criteria for standard blood donors set forth by the federal regulation 21 CFR 630.10 and 21 CFR 630.15; and standard testing is to be undertaken set as per regulation 21 CFR 610.40. So far, five clinical trials have begun to investigate convalescent plasma in a variety of COVID-19 settings: 44 as prophylaxis after exposure, in treatment of symptomatic but mild disease to avoid complications and hospitalization, for moderate disease in hospitalized patients to prevent ICU admission and ventilation, as rescue therapy in severe infection in mechanically ventilated patients, and in pediatric patients. For patients who may not meet criteria for these clinical trials, the FDA has also approved protocols for emergency use and expanded access. 49 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

These pros and cons must be weighed in the context of data presented in the literature, and identifying the literature that presents the strongest evidence is fundamental. Though there are many case reports and case series that espouse the benefits of convalescent plasma, they select for the patients who did well and are confounded by co-administration of other treatment modalities, making it difficult to discern the contribution of the convalescent plasma in the patient's improvement. The nonrandomized and randomized studies presented herein appear to both support and refute the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma in the setting of viral infections.
