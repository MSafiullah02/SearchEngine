            "text": "Insufficient blood supply to bones and bone marrow cells reduces bone cell activity and further leads to bone destruction [18]. Therefore, osteonecrosis inevitably results in the progressive collapse of the joints and subsequent arthritis always, for which arthroplasty is ultimately required [19,20]. The main underlying reason is that bone regeneration is hampered in the harsh necrotic microenvironment [21]. Alternative therapeutic strategies include non-surgical as well as surgical managements. Some non-surgical management techniques, such as cell therapy [[22], [23], [24]], growth factor therapy [17,25], cytokine therapy [26], hormone therapy [27,28], and pharmacologic therapy [14,29,30], have shown varying levels of efficacies. However, this management also has apparent disadvantages when administered systemically or via local infusion. Systemic administration results in low concentrations at the necrotic area and causes side effects, local infusion of biological agents is also associated with problems, such as leakage, loss of bioactivity, and initial burst release [[31], [32], [33]]. Surgical management often requires bone grafting. Autografts and allografts are highly effective in enhancing bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. However, the grafts are associated with the risk of numerous complications, such as limited bone mass, donor site complications, infection, and immune rejection, which limit their clinical applications [[34], [35], [36], [37]].",

Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of engineered three-dimensional (3D) scaffold-mediated therapy in enhancing bone regeneration during osteonecrosis [[38], [39], [40]]. The 3D structure of the scaffolds mimics the natural microenvironment and provides living space for cells [41,42], their porosity promotes recovery of blood supply and bone ingrowth, and their mechanical performance compensates for the insufficient support provided by the subchondral bone. Furthermore, the use of bioactive factors in combination with engineered 3D scaffolds makes it possible to limit the decrease in bioactivity, reduce the occurrence of complications, and enable targeted therapy.",

Degradability allows the materials to merge with the newly formed tissue and promotes the release of drugs loaded in the 3D scaffolds [68,69]. Osteonecrosis commonly occurs in joints, such as the hip joint. The anatomical structure of the joint is complex, and surgery is challenging and prolonged in duration. Therefore, removal of bone grafts causes considerable damage to the patient. After the implanted 3D scaffolds have achieved bone regeneration, their complete degradation without the formation of toxic by-products is the key to solve this problem. In addition, bone regeneration in osteonecrosis is often impeded, owing to impaired osteogenic capability [70,71]. This requires the 3D scaffolds to maintain structural stability while exhibiting controlled degradation in order to avoid incomplete bone regeneration due to inappropriate degradation.",

Pore structure allows cells to adhere to the 3D scaffolds and proliferate. In addition, appropriate pore size and interconnection between the pores also play critical roles in promoting bone tissue growth into the 3D scaffolds [75]. Numerous studies indicate that the optimal pore size ranges from 100 to 500 \u03bcm [[76], [77], [78]]. The pores and interconnected channels in the 3D scaffolds promote nutrient and oxygen transport for penetration of cells and boost angiogenesis [[79], [80], [81]]. In osteonecrosis, the obstruction of blood supply, especially microcirculation, is one of the main reasons for the disruption of bone regeneration [40].

Osteonecrosis usually involves large joints, which are the weight-bearing parts of the body [[86], [87], [88]].

BMSCs are easy to culture and amplify in vitro and accelerate bone healing through differentiation into osteoblasts [105,106]. Therefore, these cells are of significant interest in the field of bone regeneration in osteonecrosis.

A decade ago, Yamasaki et al. [114] used porous HA scaffolds combined with BMMCs for clinical management. The functionalized 3D scaffold effectively promoted bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. Subsequently, Kang et al. [57] constructed 3D scaffolds of strontium (Sr)-doped TCP seeded with BMMCs and analyzed their therapeutic effects. The functionalized 3D scaffolds had excellent porosity, conducive to the proliferation of BMMCs. Furthermore, penetration of newly formed bone through the functionalized 3D scaffolds was observed by studies. These findings suggest that 3D scaffolds seeded with BMMCs have a positive effect on bone regeneration in osteonecrosis.",

For example, 3D scaffolds provide local mechanical support, while biomaterial coatings on their surface promote proliferation and adhesion of cells. Finally, PRP is introduced to functionalize the 3D scaffolds. Using this strategy, Zhu et al. [66] created a multi-functionalized 3D Ti/gelatin/PRP scaffold with the capacity to release growth factors stably. The functionalized 3D scaffolds exhibited excellent biosafety and elicited accelerated bone growth. These effects were also demonstrated in an animal model. In another study, TCP/PRP 3D scaffold was designed and manufactured by Zhang et al. [98] The area of new bone had significantly increased in the group of functionalized 3D scaffold. These studies collectively indicate that the 3D scaffold is an effective carrier of PRP for enhanced bone regeneration.",

The application of Mg as a component of 3D scaffolds is a common strategy to resolve these limitations. Lai et al.

The addition of Mg significantly improved the mechanical performance of the functionalized 3D scaffolds. After 12 weeks of implantation in the rabbit femoral condyle, newly formed bone tissue and new vessel in the functionalized 3D scaffold group were observed. In particular, in the 8th week, the group of functionalized 3D scaffolds had the most significant proportion of neovasculature and the best vascular structure. These findings established that the Mg-based functionalized 3D scaffolds exhibited great potential for enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis and was expected to be useful in clinical practice.",

Li et al. [59,60] established a functionalized 3D Li-nHA scaffold and confirmed that it improved bone formation and inhibited lipogenesis. The functionalized 3D scaffolds achieved the sustained release of Li and enhanced healing ability. The 3D scaffold containing Li enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis more effectively than others (Fig. 9).",

In addition to biocompatibility and biodegradability, the porosity of the engineered 3D scaffolds facilitates the ingrowth of new bone and neovascularization.

However, most of the current studies have only explored the mechanical performance of 3D scaffolds in vitro, and the possibility of differences between the mechanical performance in vivo and in vitro should not be ignored. Therefore, subsequent research should aim to accurately elucidate the specific changes in the mechanical performance of 3D scaffolds in vivo. Furthermore, these characteristics have a mutually restrictive relationship. For example, excessive porosity may lead to a decrease in mechanical strength. In contrast, overly rapid degradation may lead to the accumulation of by-products, and overly slow degradation may affect the repair.
