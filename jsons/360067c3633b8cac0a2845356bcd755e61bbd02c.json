Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to measure PCBP2 messenger RNA and protein expression in glioma tissues or cells. Cell transfection was completed using Lipofectamine 2000. 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of PCBP2 expression on biological behaviors of glioma cells. Western blot assay was used for the detection of pathway related proteins. Expression of PCBP2 in glioma tissues and cells were higher than that in paracancerous tissues and normal cells (both p < .01). Moreover, the elevated expression of PCBP2 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = .001) and WHO stage (p = .010). Knockdown of PCBP2 could suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote apoptosis. Besides, the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway related proteins TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad2 and p-Smad7 were decreased following the downregulation of PCBP2. PCBP2 also inhibited FHL3 expression by binding to FHL3-3\u2032UTR. The inhibition of FHL3 could reverse the antitumor action caused by PCBP2 silencing. In vivo assay, PCBP2 was also found to inhibit the tumor growth of glioma. PCBP2 activates TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway by inhibiting FHL3 expression, thus promoting the development and progression of glioma.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "the molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive progression of glioma may provide the novel therapeutic targets for the fatal cancer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2), a RNA-binding protein with 39 kDa, can regulate RNA stabilization, translational silencing and enhancement (Collier, Goobar-Larsson, Sokolowski, & Schwartz, 1998; Wan et al., 2016) .

Besides, the expression of FHL3 did not obviously influence the expression of PCBP2. Therefore, FHL3 might be a downstream target gene of PCBP2 in glioma.Moreover, the vivo mice experiment also verified the results in our study. A gene chip assay performed by Han et al. also indicated the link between PCBP2 and FHL3 in glioma progression(Han et al., 2013). PCBP2 may bind to 3\u2032UTR of FHL3 gene(Han, Xia, Yin, & Peng, 2014). It has been reported to bind several target genes in diseases.PCBP2 could regulate CDK2 via direct 3\u2032UTR binding in gastric cancer patients, which might be used as a potential biomarker for the therapy of gastric cancer(Chen et al., 2018). Xin et al. also reported that PCBP2 could promote the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 against HCV by stabilizing the mRNA of STAT1 and STAT2(Xin et al., 2011). In addition, we found that the inhibition of FHL3 expression might enhance TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway activity in glioma cells which were transfected by si-PCBP2.
