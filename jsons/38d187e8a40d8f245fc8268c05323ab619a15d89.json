Studies in mice have shown a relationship between the gut microbiota and impaired viral clearance. Abt et al investigated antibiotic administration in a mouse model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and found that antibiotic administration led to decreased innate viral immunity response as well as delayed clearance. 3 Further studies have revealed that butyrate, a product of certain gut anaerobic bacteria, can have an immunomodulatory role and contributes to overall health in distant sites such as the lung. 4 Haak et al investigated the role of butyrate-producing gut (BPG) bacteria on future development of viral infections. In a cohort of 360 allogeneic HSCT recipients, they reported that having a >1% relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria is associated with 5-fold less future development of lower respiratory viral infections. 5 Based upon this study, we profiled the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4-V5 region in 510 fecal specimens from 168 kidney transplant recipients. We report that having a >1% relative abundance of BPG bacteria is associated with less risk for development of respiratory viral infections in kidney transplant recipients, which provides further support for the findings from the Haak et al study. 5 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 110, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 546, "end": 547, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 741, "end": 742, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1068, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1485, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Kidney transplant recipients provided fecal specimens using the Fisherbrand \u2122 commode specimen collection kit (Thermo Fisher Science).

The Higher BPG Bacteria Group had a decreased risk for development of CMV viremia at 1 year post transplantation (HR:0.28, 95% CI: 0.06-1.23, P = .09; Figure 5E) compared with the Lower BPG Bacteria Group. There were no significant differences in the hazard ratio between the Higher BPG Bacteria Group and the Lower BPG Bacteria Group with respect to future development of BK viremia at 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years post transplantation (P > .10; Figure 5G-I). With a bottom quartile cutoff of the mean relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria (6.76%), there were 41 subjects in the Lower BPG Bacteria Group and 122 subjects in the Higher BPG Bacteria Group. The Higher BPG Bacteria Group had a decreased risk for development of RV infections at 6 months post transplantation (HR:0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.59, P = .002; Figure 6A), at 1 year post transplantation (HR:0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.78, P = .009; Figure 6B), and at 2 years post transplantation (HR:0.41, 95% CI: 0.21-0.82, P = .01; Figure 6C) compared with the Lower BPG Bacteria Group. There were no significant differences in the hazard ratio between the Higher BPG Bacteria Group and the Lower BPG Bacteria Group with respect to future development of CMV viremia or BK viremia at 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years post transplantation (P > .10; Figure 6D-I). With a median quartile cutoff of the mean relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria (10.95%), there were 82 subjects in the Lower BPG Bacteria Group and 81 subjects in the Higher BPG Bacteria Group. The Higher BPG Bacteria Group had a decreased risk for development of RV infections at 6 months post transplantation (HR:0.40, 95% CI 0.15-1.05, P = .06; Figure S3A) compared with the Lower BPG Bacteria Group.

Survival curve for BK viremia survival free proportion at 2 y post transplantation usually receive a preoperative antibiotic for surgical prophylaxis and a Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis, but do not routinely receivebroad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage so differences in antibiotic regimens may explain the dichotomy in the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria between the two populations. We also found that gender and steroid maintenance therapy were associated with a lower relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria, which could have also contributed to the dichotomy. With respect to gender, little is known about the differences in the relative gut abundance of BPG between men and women. A recent study by Gao et al noted differences in the gut microbiota in obese individuals stratified by gender 12 so it is possible that gender may contribute to the differences in relative gut abundances of BPG bacteria, which may have implications for immune system modulation beyond viral infections.There are several limitations related to our study. First, there are significant gaps in the timing of the stool specimen evaluation and the timing of viral diagnoses. While our limited data suggest the stability of the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria in subjects who did not receive antibiotics, the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria may have changed over the course of time in the setting of antibiotic usage, which we did not account for in our survival curve F I G U R E 5 Survival curves based on a 1% cutoff of the mean relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria cutoff.
