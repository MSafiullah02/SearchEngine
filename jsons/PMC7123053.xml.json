These are loaded onto the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) by the APC that are recognized by CD3 (as well as CD4/CD8). The T-cell receptor on CD3 interacts with the MHC of the APC , this is stabilized by CD4/CD8, resulting in \u201cSIGNAL 1\u201d, a calcium-dependent pathway.\nT-cell activation\u2014This is achieved by binding of co-stimulatory molecules (CD-28, CD-40, PD1) on T-cells with ligands on the antigen presenting cell\u2014\u201cSIGNAL 2\u201d, a Ca2+-independent process. Both signals are required for na\u00efve T-cell activation and are mediated by calcineurin and Protein Kinase C activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), nuclear factor kB (NF-KB) and AP-1. These bind to gene promoters associated with T-cell activation and proliferation, i.e. promotes IL2 production which initiates G0 to G1 transition of the cell cycle [8]. Inhibition of this pathway has been the predominant site of action in immunosuppression therapies utilizing calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine.\n\nClonal expansion\u2014\u201cSIGNAL3\u201d: auto/paracrine activation of T-cells. Receptor of the IL2 family activates JAK 1/3 in T-cells [9] which activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), STAT5 and Ras-Raf MAP kinase resulting in cell proliferation, DNA synthesis and cell division. Sirolimus and everolimus inhibit SIGNAL 3. Other molecules are produced that inhibit SIGNAL 2 (e.g. CD152) and decrease T-cell receptor signaling [10]. Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil inhibit purine and DNA synthesis.\nInflammation\u2014Activated T cells result in release of cytokines that recruit cytotoxic T-cells, B-cells, activated macrophages and adhesion molecules. Further activated T-cells are attracted by these leading to release of TNF \u03b1/\u03b2 perforin, granzymes. Corticosteroids and antilymphocyte antibody act via inhibition of this route.\n\n\n",

The liver has been considered to be resistant to AMR due to large organ size and dual blood supply (arterial and portal) [11]. Anti-HLA class I DSA form complexes with soluble class I-MHC antigens released by the donor liver and are removed from circulation from liver Kupffer cells [11], providing further protection against AMR . Additionally, AMR can occur in the presence of acute cellular rejection. AMR is suspected in setting of unexplained graft dysfunction with thrombocytopenia, hypocomplementemia and microvasculitis with diffuse C4d staining on liver biopsy (Fig. 32.3) [12]. Whilst AMR is well recognized after renal and cardiac transplantation, its role in graft rejection post liver transplantation has only been recognized recently. The revised Banff criteria for AMR diagnosis requires histopathological pattern of injury consistent with AMR , positive serum DSA, diffuse microvascular C4d deposition and exclusion of other causes that may cause graft dysfunction [13].",

One of the byproducts of C4 degradation, C4d, is deposited on the allograft and can be detected through immunohistochemistry staining of liver biopsy specimen.Degradation products of C2 and C4 ultimately leads to formation of C3b which then activates C5 and allows formation of membrane attack complexes.

Ten to thirty percent develop cirrhosis at 5 years post transplantation [55]. Strategies used include early steroid withdrawal and the combination of induction therapy with IL-2 blockade [56]. Some in-vitro studies suggest that cyclosporine instead of tacrolimus has an inhibitory effect on replication but the concentrations used in these replication studies were greater than 1000 times of physiological concentration [57]. Furthermore cyclosporine is less diabetogenic than tacrolimus and diabetes is considered a risk factor for fibrosis progression post transplant for hepatitis C [58]. Treatment of hepatitis C either pre or post-transplant setting is now occurring with new oral-only direct acting agents (so called DAA agents). These regimes have the advantage of very high cure rates with few side effects. Some DAA regimes have minimum effect on immunosuppression levels and reinfection due to high levels of immunosuppression may be less concerning if hepatitis C is promptly treated.\n",

The need for postoperative renal replacement is associated with a two to sixfold increased risk of 1-year mortality [63]. Longitudinal studies of liver transplant patients with chronic renal insufficiency demonstrate that CNI toxicity is clinically and histologically the most common cause in patients who progress to end stage renal disease [23]. A number of strategies have been employed to minimize the dose of CNI in the immediate post transplant period in patients at risk of developing renal injury, principally those with pre-existing renal dysfunction. Minimizing early acute CNI-induced renal injury will reduce the incidence of acute and chronic renal disease later after transplant. Induction immunosuppression with IL-2 receptor blockers or ATG, and delayed or reduced dose start of CNI is commonly part of renal protective protocols. Some centers adopt the approach of converting from CNI to mTOR inhibitors in patient with acute kidney injury.\n",
