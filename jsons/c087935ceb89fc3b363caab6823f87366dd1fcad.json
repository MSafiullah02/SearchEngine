This lack of understanding is problematic because without knowing where the field has been it is difficult to chart our future to ensure a robust evidence base moving forward.",

To this end, BEME reports a 50% increase in the number of reviews undertaken by authors over a recent five-year period. 9 Over the last decade, broad bibliometric reviews of the literature have been undertaken to identify trends in medical education publishing, [10] [11] [12] recognize the most cited articles in the field, 13 characterize author networks across international borders, 14 and describe associated social media attention. 15, 16 While these studies provide important insights into the overall landscape of the medical education literature, they fail to fully illuminate knowledge syntheses and their characteristics. More recently, members of our author team conducted a meta-synthesis of BEME knowledge syntheses, attempting to identify the degree to which the reviews were ready for translation into practice and to summarize their features. 17 Although valuable, this metasynthesis examined a limited sample of knowledge syntheses (BEME reviews only) that underwent several intense review steps prior to publication; as such, the generalizability of this work is limited.",

While the overall growth of non-review journal articles has also been quite large (204% growth in our sample), the growth of knowledge synthesis has been more than 10 times that number (2,620%). We predict this trend will continue, paralleling the growth of funding opportunities (e.g., SDRME's annual funding opportunity) 8 , medical education graduate programs, 39 and related supporting initiatives such as BEME and the community's broader desire for synthesized evidence to keep current with research in the field and improve educational practice. 17 Additionally, when compared with other article types, knowledge syntheses are more highly cited, which makes them attractive to both authors and editors. For example, 80% of the top cited articles in Medical Education were review articles. 40 In the current academic climate, the count of an individual's citations are usually factored into faculty promotion and tenure decisions. 41, 42 Also, from an editor's perspective, journals are typically judged by their impact factor, a citation-based metric. In both cases, this emphasis on citations may make it difficult for authors and editors to pass up the opportunity to write and publish a review article that stands to accrue up to three times as many citations as another article type.",

In many ways, it is also a waste of resources if one considers the substantial time and energy required to complete a high-quality knowledge synthesis (that might never get translated into practice). 7 Future research should consider identifying potential barriers to uptake of knowledge syntheses specific to medical education and attempt to identify best practices for their creation, dissemination, and ultimate translation into practice.",

Gordon suggests that this proliferation of synthesis types relates to the shifting scope of investigators' research questions and aims. 2 He notes that investigators are not only focused on synthesizing literature to answer whether an educational approach works (e.g., by undertaking a systematic review), but also to discern what works, for whom, and in what contexts (e.g., by publishing a realist review) and to understand why it works and how (e.g., by conducting a meta-ethnography).",

            "text": "This increasing variety of knowledge syntheses highlights a need to ensure that consumers of these reviews are aware of the various types in order to understand in which situations they are best applied, as well as to be better able to judge their quality. For example, educators who are most familiar with the positivist tradition of systematic reviews may find themselves in strange territory when reading or attempting to execute a scoping review which, by design, is not designed to provide a \"single answer\" like a systematic review. Instead, scoping reviews provide readers with a map of the information landscape on a topic in an effort to help readers subjectively interpret the available evidence. 47 As Thomas et al. recently noted, \"the philosophical stance scholars adopt during the execution of a scoping review, including the meaning they attribute to fundamental concepts such as knowledge and evidence, influences how they gather, analyze, and interpret information obtained from a heterogeneous body of literature.\" 44 Therefore, anyone considering a knowledge synthesis must first understand the various types so that they can then identify the most appropriate synthesis type to answer their research question or satisfy their study aim. 44 To meet this need, several published articles compare and contrast knowledge syntheses types and provide practical advice for their conduct and use. [45] [46] [47] [48] Dissemination of knowledge syntheses Knowledge translation is defined as a dynamic and iterative process that includes the synthesis, dissemination, exchange, and ethically sound application of knowledge to improve health, provide more effective health services and products, and strengthen the health care system. 3 In this review, we focus on the knowledge synthesis component of the knowledge translation process, which is critical. We propose, however, that increased accessibility for these articles, as indicated by higher altmetric scores for newer reviews, provides a glimpse into efforts to disseminate this knowledge and build a bridge to span the knowledge to practice gap. In this study, we observed that 80% of knowledge syntheses received altmetric attention with mentions predominantly on Twitter. In medical education, tweets have been observed to have a small positive effect on article page views of the tweeted articles. 50 In addition, we found that 69 knowledge syntheses were integrated into 99 policy documents, which suggests a translation of knowledge into practice. While these findings are promising, we encourage medical education researchers to consider other ways in which social media and policy integration can be leveraged as a knowledge translation tool for sharing knowledge syntheses.",

            "text": "This study should be considered in light of its limitations. In particular, although we conducted a comprehensive search for reviews, it is possible we inadvertently excluded one or more reviews. In addition, our search was limited to 14 core medical education journals, which did not include specialty-specific medical education journals (e.g., Academic Emergency Medicine) or medical education journals from specific world regions (e.g., African Journal of Health Professions Education). In addition, for citation data, we relied on WoS, which uses selective indexing, and so we were unable to obtain citation data for 125 (13%) knowledge syntheses. Future work might consider alternate citation sources such as Google Scholar, Dimensions, or an amalgamation of such services, with the caveat that each service has a slightly different approach for data collection, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses.",

In addition to a 2,620% increase in knowledge synthesis volume, medical educators have responded by introducing the field to new review types and by utilizing methods, such as posting to social media, for communicating about and sharing knowledge syntheses. As we look to the future of medical education theory, research, and practice, we envision continued production of knowledge syntheses, which will empower our community to act as evidenceinformed educators.
