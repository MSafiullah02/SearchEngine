Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic.1 Limitations on direct personal contact and physical (social) distancing have influenced access to care and how it is provided. Patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies continue to need expert care within current public health constraints. In addition, there is growing evidence that COVID-19 may predispose patients to both arterial and venous thromboembolic disease and extensive coagulopathies further complicating the prognosis of the affected patients.2\n,\n3\n,\n4 To facilitate triage in this demanding setting we recommend the use of a standardised scale to rationalise and harmonise the management of these patients during this difficult period.",

When evidence was lacking or limited, consensus was developed. The document was shared with an international expert panel of phlebologists and vascular specialists representing the endorsing societies and further topics and recommendations were included and the final document formulated. Consensus on triage and acuity was reached when a recommendation was unanimously supported by all authors. In case of any dissenting opinion multiple attempts were made to modify the recommendation. At the end of the consensus process all participating authors approved the final version of the document and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work.",
