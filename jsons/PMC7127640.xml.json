Over the past decades, marked progress has been made in the understanding of the complex structure of this organelle, and in the mechanisms by which proteins are transported within its compartments (Berger, 1997). A growing number of Golgi-associated or Golgi-resident proteins has been identified in recent years. Many of these molecules are involved in the processing of proteins synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Roth, 1997), or in the transport of protein cargo within the Golgi apparatus (Duden and Schekman, 1997). However, in many cases the function of newly identified Golgi resident proteins remains unknown, and the regulation of their expression is incompletely understood (Farquhar and Hauri, 1997). The identification of novel Golgi proteins and the elucidation of their function is likely to contribute to a better understanding of this organelle in normal and diseased tissues.",

GCH is characterized by the presence of large, hepatocyte-derived syncitial giant cells, and by a fulminant course in many affected patients. Based on the histological and ultrastructural features of the disease, a viral etiology has been postulated (Fimmel et al., 1998, Phillips et al., 1991). A directional cDNA library was prepared from two percutaneous liver biopsies of the index patient (ZAP Express, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (Fimmel et al., 1998). A normal adult liver cDNA library was obtained commercially (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GCH-specific cDNA clones were identified by differential hybridization. Briefly, a cDNA probe generated from the mass-excised GCH library was enriched for disease-specific clones by subtractive hybridization with complementary T3 RNA derived from the normal liver library. GCH-enriched and normal liver-derived, 32P-labeled cDNA probes were used to screen duplicate plaque lifts representing the GCH phage library. Clones with differential signals were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Using this methodology, we identified several novel clones that represented differentially expressed mRNAs. One clone was of particular interest because of its extensive sequence identity to a previously described partial cDNA that was identified in cultured amniotic cells in response to infection with the Newcastle disease virus (\u2018Human Newcastle disease virus-inducible mRNA\u2019, GenBank accession no. U25276). The full-length GP73 cDNA was isolated by rapid amplification of 5\u2032 cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR (Ausubel et al., 1987), and sequenced in both directions by automated dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Sequence analyses were performed using Blast algorithms and other software programs available through the Worldwide Web (Altschul et al., 1990). The GenBank accession number for GP73 is AF23056.",

Reactions were performed with the full-length GP73 cDNA in pBK-CMV in the presence of 10 mCi/ml 35S-methionine. A control reaction was performed using the cDNA encoding pre-\u03b2-lactamase, a secretory protein. Parallel reactions were performed in the presence of optimized amounts of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of the reactions were treated with Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) for 30 min at 0\u00b0C. This treatment removes peripheral or secreted proteins from the microsomes but leaves integral membrane proteins intact (Gilmore and Blobel, 1985). Next, the alkaline-treated samples were centrifuged at 80 000g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to pelletize the microsomes. The pellets were then washed with PBS and resuspended in 1\u00d7sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Alternatively, aliquots of the translation reaction were incubated with Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (33 U/ml) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. PNGase F treatment cleaves the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins (Maley et al., 1989). Following PNGase F treatment, the samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2\u00d7SDS loading buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol. Treated and untreated reaction products were separated by SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE), and visualized by autoradiography.",

We obtained 293 cells that had been stably transfected with the pVgRXR plasmid, which encodes the ecdysone receptor and Zeocin resistance genes [EcR293, (No et al., 1996)]. The cells were maintained in 125 \u03bcg/ml Zeocin. An inducible GP73 expression plasmid was prepared by blunt-ended ligation of the full-length GP73 uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) into an EcoRV site located within the multi-cloning site of pIND(SP1)/V5/His (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmid contained a minimal heat-shock promoter and five copies of the ecdysone/glucocorticoid response element upstream of the GP73 ORF, followed by an in-frame V5 epitope tag and a polyhistidine tag. EcR-293 cells were transfected with the GP73 expression plasmid by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Individual clones displaying ponasterone A-inducible GP73 expression were identified immunocytochemically by antibody staining for the V5 epitope as described below. Select double-transfected clones were maintained in media containing 500 \u03bcg/ml G418 and 250 \u03bcg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After induction with ponasterone A (5 \u03bcM) for 16 h, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Aliquots of fixed cells were sequentially incubated with mouse mAbs directed against V5 or against giantin, a known Golgi integral membrane protein (Linstedt et al., 1997). Antibody binding was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibodies at the manufacturer's recommended dilutions (Sigma Pharmaceuticals, St. Louis, MO). In control experiments, the order of primary antibody addition did not affect the fluorescent signals. Furthermore, staining with single antibodies gave identical signals to that observed with combinations of both primary and secondary antibodies (not shown). Control reactions were performed in which the primary antibodies were omitted. The cells were viewed under a Zeiss confocal microscope (Zeiss, New York, NY).",

Subsequently, the blot was stripped, and rehybridized to a control probe directed against human ubiquitin cDNA, following the manufacturer's specifications (Clontech). The hybridization signals were quantified by densitometry. The GP73 signals were corrected for their respective ubiquitin signals, and expressed relative to the signal obtained in normal liver tissue. For RNA measurements in cultured cells, total cellular RNA was isolated using a rapid, guanidine-based method (RNA Stat 60, Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). 20 \u03bcg aliquots of RNA were hybridized to the GP73 antisense cRNA probe (see above) by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), using a commercial kit (RPAIII, Ambion, Austin, TX). The RPA control probe was directed against a 316 bp fragment of the human GAPDH cDNA (Ambion).",

The PCR fragment was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE9 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), using the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites within the multicloning site. The vector features an N-terminal 6\u00d7 Histidine tag for the purification of the recombinant protein from bacterial lysates. The GP73\u2013His fusion protein was expressed in XL1 Blue bacteria, and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, following the manufacturer's protocols (Ni-NTA agarose, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antisera were obtained against recombinant GP73 protein, following standard immunological methods (Harlow and Lane, 1999). Animal maintenance, antigen injections, and bleeds were performed by a commercial vendor (Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory, Inc., Canadensie, PA). Western blotting studies were performed on lysates of HepSK-1 cells, a cell line that spontaneously expresses GP73 mRNA (Fimmel, unpublished data), and on 293 cells that had been transfected with the GP73 expression plasmid. Cultured cells were treated with lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 20 mM DTT, 62.5 mM Tris\u2013Cl pH 6.8), and 15 \u03bcg aliquots of cellular protein were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE. After transfer to PVDF membranes, western blot analysis was performed using rabbit GP73 antiserum. Control reactions were performed using pre-immune sera from the same animal. The reaction products were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL).",

            "text": "The full-length GP73 cDNA comprises 3042 bp and contains a single ORF of 1200 bp (Fig. 1A\n). Two in-frame methionine codons (bp 151 and bp 178) spaced ten codons apart provide potential sites for translational initiation (Fig. 1A, underlined ATG codons) (Kozak, 1987). Both codons are contained within likely consensus sites for eukaryotic translational initiation, and would yield proteins of 400 or 391 amino acids respectively. The 3\u2032 UTR contains an in-frame stop codon at bp 1351 (marked by asterisks) and three potential polyadenylation sites at bp 1448, 2950, and 3003. The 400 aa protein has a predicted molecular mass of 45 kDa. It contains a high percentage of acidic amino acids (Asp 5.5%, Glu 12.2%), and has a pI=4.72. A comparison of the GP73 cDNA sequence with the GenBank expressed sequence tags (EST) data base showed extensive areas of identity at the cDNA level with the tentative human clone 168297 (THC 168297) that has been localized to BAC WI-6758 on chromosome 9. Compared with the full-length cDNA, the THC lacks crucial 5\u2032 coding information. BLAST and FASTA analyses of the GP73 cDNA revealed an additional human EST sequence with significant homology but not identity at the cDNA level (gb AC003976, p=10\u221223). This putative homolog has so far not been characterized. The predicted GP73 protein is predominantly hydrophilic but has a hydrophobic N-terminus, as determined by Kyte\u2013Doolittle hydrophobicity analysis (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) (Fig. 1B). The N-terminus is predicted to encode a single membrane-spanning domain (underlined in Fig. 1A), with a potential signal peptidase cleavage site between amino acids 28 and 29 (VLG-FN) (Nielsen et al., 1997). The C-terminus is predicted to be extracellularly located, and contains no additional transmembrane stretches. The N-terminus contains an N-myristoylation consensus sequence [GLGNGRRS, Fig. 1A, tilde (\u223c) symbol]. This feature is of potential interest since several cellular N-myristoyl proteins play important roles in signal transduction and in protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions (Rudnick et al., 1993). No nuclear, mitochondrial, or lysosomal targeting sequences are predicted (Schutze et al., 1994). Five potential glycosylation sites are present in the C-terminus of the protein (Fig. 1A, ^ symbol) (Hansen et al., 1995, Hansen et al., 1998). Several coiled coil domains are found immediately following the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1C). Coiled coils are involved in protein\u2013protein interactions (Lupas, 1996, Lupas et al., 1991), suggesting that GP73 may interact with other proteins through its extracellular domain.",

            "text": "Hydropathicity analysis of the deduced GP73 protein predicts a single, N-terminal hydrophobic segment long enough to span the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). In order to determine the membrane topology of GP73, in vitro transcription\u2013translation studies were performed in the absence or presence of canine microsomes (Fig. 2\n). The addition of microsomes allows membrane proteins to be translocated, glycosylated, and to have signal peptides cleaved (Blobel et al., 1985). Translation in the absence of microsomes yielded a predominant protein band of approximately 53 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3). Close inspection reveals a doublet, compatible with two translation products with similar molecular weights. This indicates that both putative translation start sites are being used (see Fig. 1A). The molecular size of GP73 is larger than would be expected from the size of its ORF. A similar electrophoretic behavior has previously been reported for other highly acidic proteins, including presenilin (Daigle and Li, 1993). It has been suggested that the retarded migration of these proteins may be due to their unusually acidic nature, which might interfere with their denaturation by SDS during electrophoresis. Transcription\u2013translation in the presence of microsomes was followed by the appearance of two predominant products with upshifted molecular weights of 58 and 62 kDa, suggesting the occurrence of post-translational modification of the core protein (Fig. 2, lane 4). We hypothesized that this molecular size shift might be due to the glycosylation of the protein in the microsomes. In order to test this hypothesis, we treated an aliquot of the reaction product with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) after solubilization of the microsomes. As shown in lane 6, PNGaseF treatment reduced the molecular size to that observed in the absence of microsomes. These data demonstrate that GP73 is glycosylated, in agreement with the predictions made from the analysis of its cDNA sequence (see Fig. 1A). The identical size of the proteins in lanes 3 and 6 argues against the proteolytic removal of a leader peptide, which would have resulted in a 2\u20133 kDa reduction of their apparent molecular weights. Integral membrane proteins can be distinguished from secretory and peripheral membrane proteins by treating the microsomes at high pH. This treatment will extract vesicle contents (e.g. secreted proteins) and dissociate peripheral membrane proteins, but will not dissociate integral membrane proteins (Gilmore and Blobel, 1985). As shown in lane 5, alkaline treatment (pH 11.5) of the microsomes did not remove the GP73 protein, although this treatment did completely remove the control secretory protein, \u03b2-lactamase (lane 1: \u03b2-lactamase cDNA translated in the presence of microsomes, molecular weight 29 kDa; lane 2: alkaline treatment of an aliquot of material from lane 1). We conclude that GP73 is an integral membrane protein with a type II topology.",

A comparison of the GP73 immunoreactivity pattern with the transmission microscopic images of the same cells demonstrated a juxtanuclear distribution (Fig. 3C). Occasionally, the stained structures encircled the nucleus without overlapping with the nuclear membrane. This pattern is characteristic of a Golgi distribution in many cultured cells (Louvard et al., 1982). The signal for GP73 colocalized with that for giantin, a type II Golgi membrane protein that is located in the cis- and medial-Golgi subcompartments (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993) (Fig. 3B). The localization of was not affected by cycloheximide treatment or by varying the ponasterone A concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 \u03bcM (data not shown). These results suggest that the Golgi localization of GP73 was not due to a delay in the intracellular transport of the overexpressed protein or to the inhibition of protein trafficking out of the Golgi apparatus. Staining of nonpermeabilized cells revealed no GP73 immunoreactivity, suggesting that the protein was not expressed at the cell surface (data not shown).

A wide range of mRNA steady-state levels was observed (Fig. 5B). Particularly high levels were present in the colon, stomach, prostate, and trachea.

Adenovirus infection of cultured HepG2 cells provides a useful in vitro model to study the interaction between viral infection and host cell gene expression. We measured GP73 expression in HepG2 cells that were infected with the recombinant adenovirus rec700 (Fig. 8\n). Under control conditions (mock infection), no GP73 mRNA or protein were detectable in cellular extracts. In contrast, GP73 mRNA became detectable after adenovirus infection. Of note, GP73 protein expression was particularly strong in virus-infected cells in the presence of Ara C. Since Ara C prevents viral DNA replication and the expression of late adenoviral genes, this finding suggests that GP73 expression is a feature of early adenovirus infection. The absence of GP73 protein in adenovirus-infected cells in the absence of Ara C (despite the presence of GP73 mRNA) is most likely due to the suppression of cellular protein synthesis in late infection. Our data suggest that GP73 expression is an authentic feature of the cellular response to adenovirus infection.",

            "text": "GP73 displays the typical features of a type II transmembrane protein: a short cytoplasmic N-terminus followed by a single transmembrane domain and a longer, lumenal C-terminal domain (Munro, 1998). Our immunocytochemical data demonstrate that GP73 localizes to the Golgi apparatus, as evidenced by its colocalization with the Golgi marker protein giantin (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993). In view of the known distribution of giantin in the cis- and medial-Golgi cisternae, we postulate that GP73 is contained in the same subcompartments. Based on our initial sequence information, we considered alternative cellular localizations of GP73. In particular, the presence of a putative signal peptidase cleavage site adjacent to the transmembrane domain raised the possibility that GP73 might be a secreted protein (Nielsen et al., 1997). However, our in vitro translation data clearly demonstrate that GP73 becomes alkali-resistant upon incorporation into microsomal membranes, a feature that is typical for integral membrane proteins and incompatible with secreted or peripheral membrane proteins. The possibility that GP73 might be targeted to the plasma membrane was also considered. However, our immunocytochemical data consistently demonstrated the absence of any plasma membrane staining, suggesting that GP73 is not localized to this membrane. Unlike many of the known Golgi type II membrane proteins, GP73 is not predicted to have any oligosaccharide-modifying properties, and a computer-based motif analysis failed to predict any specific enzymatic properties of the molecule (Paulson and Colley, 1989). In this regard, GP73 resembles another recently described type II Golgi protein, GPP130/GIMPc (Linstedt et al., 1997). The two proteins share several structural features, including a highly acidic amino acid composition, and the presence of a coiled coil domain. Golgi proteins with acidic pK\nA values have been postulated to play a role in calcium sequestration. Coiled coil domains may provide interactions with other proteins in the Golgi lumen, including homo- or hetero-dimerizations (Farquhar and Hauri, 1997). The identification of such interacting proteins in future experiments may provide clues about the function of GP73.",

Based on indirect morphological and serological evidence, a paramyxoviral infection has been implicated as the etiological agent in many cases of the disease (Fimmel et al., 1998, Phillips et al., 1991), but no specific viral agent has been identified to date. Many of the morphological alterations of human GCH are reminiscent of the changes observed in models of murine coronavirus hepatitis. Morphologically, this infection is characterized by the disruption of the normal intracellular vesicle targeting process through the interaction of viral proteins with resident Golgi proteins (Lavi et al., 1996, Opstelten et al., 1996). Interestingly, mice rendered immunodeficient by homozygous deficiency of the transcription factor STAT1 develop syncitial GCH upon infection with coronavirus (Durbin et al., 1996), suggesting that the distinct phenotype of human GCH may be due to the combination of an impaired immunological response and a viral infection. Based on the similarities between human and murine GCH, we speculate that the Golgi apparatus may be an important target for the putative viral agent in this disease. Our data provide a rationale for a search for viral proteins that might interact with GP73 in this disease.",

This response may not be limited to one particular virus, since a partial GP73 cDNA was first isolated based on its overexpression in an in vitro model of Newcastle virus infection (gb U25276). The functional implications of increased GP73 expression in viral infection remain to be determined. In principle, GP73 expression might affect viral replication, intracellular trafficking of viral proteins, or the maturation of viral particles. Alternatively, it might lead to changes in host cell function, for example by altering cellular proliferation or differentiation. These possibilities can now be addressed using suitable in vitro models. Our findings in the adenovirus infection model suggest that early adenoviral gene functions may be required for the regulation of GP73 expression. Of note, the early adenoviral E1A protein has previously been reported to induce an \u2018epithelial phenotype\u2019 in mesenchymally derived tumor cell lines (Frisch, 1994), a feature that is reminiscent of its expression in hepatocyte syncitia. In future studies, we plan to utilize the availability of mutant adenoviral strains with defects in E1A and other early genes to map viral genes that are necessary for GP73 expression. Furthermore, it will be of interest to determine whether GP73 expression is upregulated in response to infection with known hepatotropic viruses, such as hepatitis B and C viruses. If positive, such studies might support the use of GP73 as a serum or tissue marker of viral disease.",
