The heterologous antigen gene may be of viral, bacterial, parasitic, oncologic, or gene therapy-based. The heterologous gene may comprise sequences coding for a portion of an antigen or an entire antigen, more than one antigen or heterologous antigen genes from more than one infectious agent [24], [25]. In some cases protection against the wild-type virus from which the vector is derived, may also be sought [26].",

The virulence of live recombinant viral vaccines cannot be predicted from that of the viral vector, even when the vector is already attenuated for humans [25], which emphasizes the need for extensive safety studies during clinical development before public health use. This will be even more critical where a vector of non-human virus origin is utilized. Information on the pathogenicity of the wild-type virus for humans may be limited or absent. The potential for reversion to virulence or for recombination or reassortment with circulating wild-type viruses also must be considered [25], [26].

            "text": "As some live recombinant vectored-vaccines may integrate, one key challenge is defining the length of time for monitoring potentially related AEFI after receipt of viral vectored-vaccines. This time period must be chosen with care and based on considerations of clinical trials data and biological plausibility [36]. The follow-up time must be long enough to include (a) the plausible period of increased risk (also called \u201crisk window\u201d or \u201crisk interval\u201d), and (b) the comparison control \u201cnon-risk\u201d time period for study designs where this period occurs post- (vs. pre-) risk window. In some studies of vaccine-associated Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), the risk interval included days 1\u201342 after vaccination during which vaccine-associated GBS was considered to be biologically plausible and the control interval was days 43\u201384 after vaccination. The number of events of each type was tabulated each week and the number of AE in the post-vaccination window was compared with the number in the pre-vaccination window. This case-only self-controlled method (also referred to as self-controlled case series or SCCS) is commonly used in influenza vaccine safety studies to eliminate between-person biases [37]. SCCS is a preferred study design to avoid the \u201chealthy vaccinee\u201d effect (HVE) commonly associated with pre-risk control windows. HVE refers to the fact that if an individual has been ill, recently hospitalized, or otherwise unwell, vaccination may be deferred by the health care provider, patient or primary caregiver until the health of the individual improves. This consideration is especially true for vaccinations in early infancy. Therefore, a vaccinated individual is more likely to be in a healthy state immediately before and after their vaccination. Consequently, HVE reduces AE rates in the immediate pre- and post-vaccination periods, reducing the power to detect AE [38]. Selecting a surveillance duration that is too short or too long could cause a true increase in risk to be missed or obscured by random noise. Ideally, this duration should be based on statistical power considerations (e.g., continued until 90% power is achieved to detect the minimum absolute excess risk that is important for public health) and continued until any important risk can be ruled out. Due to the differences in background rates of specific AESI, the length of planned surveillance may differ by outcome for the same vaccine under study [39]. AESI may take time to manifest and be detected (e.g., the VSV Ebola vaccine that was found in synovial fluid causing arthritis) [11].",

The group used febrile seizure and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis as models to provide an in-depth review of methodological issues related to the selection of risk and control intervals for consideration in future studies of immunization safety.

Unlike efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine safety cannot be measured directly. Human clinical trials typically are conducted using healthy non-pregnant volunteers and the safety assessment is focused on common short-term pre-specified local and systemic AE (e.g., pain at injection site, fever). Rare but serious adverse events associated with vaccines or drugs are often nearly impossible to detect on account of the selected enrollment and limited follow-up of subjects in pre-licensure studies and their detection requires conducting post-marketing monitoring (also called pharmacovigilance) after the introduction in the general population. The FDA also requires more diversity in the population studied because the incidence of AEFI might vary in different populations [48]. Safety of these products can only be inferred by the relative absence of AESI when the population exposed to the new pharmaceutical product of interest is sufficiently large, diverse and monitored adequately. Absolute safety, while understandably desired as a goal, is difficult to assess, let alone guarantee, especially early in the lifecycle of any new product.(3)\u201cReal-time\u201c prospective monitoring for unknown clusters of AEFIs in settings with validated large linked vaccine safety databases\n",

The US FDA and EMA have mandatory requirements for passive reporting of AEFI to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) [47] and EudraVigilance systems [50], respectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) is helping many LMICs improve their capacity to monitor AEFI [51], and these efforts could help to upgrade the capacity to monitor AEFIs over longer follow up periods (including coding AEFI for ICD (International Classification of Diseases), MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) etc. beyond the short follow-up periods currently used.",

For example, the CDC created the Vaccine Safety Datalink [53] (VSD) project in 1990 in collaboration with several managed care organizations. The VSD uses a distributed data model and de-identified International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coded data downloaded from the individual\u2019s electronic health record to track the use of health services by the members of each participating site. This includes information on vaccinations (e.g., vaccine type, date of vaccination, and other vaccinations given on the same day) and the specific medical illnesses that have been diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, urgent care visits, emergency department visits, and hospital stays. AEFI need to be coded accurately to be able to be found in the database. The US FDA oversees a complementary active safety surveillance system for vaccines called the Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) program [54]. This consists mostly of insurance claims. The program is attempting to move to healthcare records and this brings with it new challenges.",

            "text": "TreeScan is a novel scan statistical method by which the surveillance can be conducted with a minimum of prior assumptions about the group of vaccines that increase risk, and which adjusts for the multiple testing inherent in the many potential combinations [61]. TreeScan is free data mining software that implements the tree-based scan statistic, a data mining method that simultaneously looks for excess risk in any of a large number of individual cells in a database as well as in groups of closely related cells, adjusting for the multiple testing inherent in the large number of overlapping groups evaluated. It has been developed for disease surveillance. For pharmacovigilance, it can be used to simultaneously evaluate thousands of potential adverse events and groups of adverse events, to determine if any one of them occur with higher probability among people exposed to a particular vaccine. For a particular disease outcome (e.g. kidney failure), it can be used to simultaneously evaluate if it occurs with increased risk among people exposed any of hundreds of pharmaceutical drugs or vaccines, or groups of related drugs or vaccines (https://www.treescan.org/). The TreeScan method allows a wide range of unsuspected but potentially adverse reactions to be simultaneously evaluated and otherwise unknown adverse reactions may be found. The main disadvantage is that it is not possible to adjust for all possible confounders. Indeed, no conclusion about causality should be based on TreeScan analyses alone. In effect, the TreeScan method serves as a tool for identifying AE that may merit a further careful pharmaco-epidemiologic investigation [55]. Treescan is only beginning to be used more widely, so more time is needed to assess its effectiveness (e.g., AESI with insidious onset have traditionally been challenging to study in traditional large-linked databases using methods requiring a prior definition of risk intervals). The use of Treescan will also likely to be limited to settings with high-quality administrative health (including immunization) records initially. For LMICs, this requirement may be more likely to be met in some urban centers and INDEPTH Network sites.",

Since cases in a case-control are by definition subjects who have already developed the condition of interest, there is no need to wait for time to elapse. A similar approach can be taken for safety monitoring of viral vector vaccine candidates with the establishment of a registry of cases identified with clinically valid pre-specified AESI and matched controls found from the hospital or neighborhood to compare for vaccine exposure history. These studies can be multi-national under a similar protocol. Given the rarity of these AESI, this is likely feasible only with post-marketing surveillance after substantial vaccine use has occurred.

Live viral vectored vaccines may be based on replication-defective as well as replication-competent viruses. As some live recombinant vectored vaccine may replicate, one key challenge is defining the length of time for monitoring AEFI after administration of vectored vaccines in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. This time period must be chosen with care and based on considerations of clinical trial data and biological plausibility. A long duration of monitoring is often challenging in countries with poor health infrastructure, in countries with evolving AEFI monitoring systems with multiple priorities and even in countries with excellent infrastructure which are challenged with new diseases and new vaccines [36], [40]. Some of the available options for defining the length of follow-up to be used in studies of new viral vector vaccine candidates include adapting from current relevant regulatory guidelines; convening a panel of experts to review the evidence from a systematic literature search to narrow down a list of likely or known AEFI and optimal biologically plausible risk window(s); conducting \u201cnear-real-time\u201c prospective monitoring for unknown clustering\u2019s of AEFI in validated large linked vaccine safety databases (e.g., Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), PRISM, etc.). This includes Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA) for pre-specified AESI and TreeScan for previously unsuspected outcomes. The risk interval established by one of the above-mentioned methods can be used along with establishing a registry of cases identified with clinically validated pre-specified AESI to include in case-control studies. The available infrastructure, human and financial resources, coded databases in countries and regulatory guidelines will determine which (one or a combination) of these methods would be practically feasible. These options might be broadly applicable to the duration of surveillance for other new pharmaceutical products. The risk intervals selected for clinical trials or epidemiologic studies may not be of the appropriate length to rule out associations in individual cases. Since our knowledge of the pathophysiology of many AEFI is incomplete; a longer risk interval may be required when evaluating an AEFI in an individual. Rare individuals may have genetic immune defects that result in increased susceptibility to vaccine viruses. Mortality rates in vaccine recipients with such defects may be high. However, because of their rarity, they are likely to be discovered only in post-marketing analyses [63].",
