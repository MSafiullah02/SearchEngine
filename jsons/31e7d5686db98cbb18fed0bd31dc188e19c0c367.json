These events pose serious threats to people and have resulted in a great loss of people's lives and property. For example, by March 21, 2020, 15 earthquakes had occurred in China during the COVID-19 outbreak, increasing the fears, concerns, and anxiety of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people about natural disasters and public health emergencies (China Earthquake Administration, 2020). Flash floods, bushfires, and dust storms have occurred in Australia, killing at least 33 people and more than a billion animals, and destroying nearly 11 million hectares of land and thousands of homes (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2020) . In America, more than 19 million people contracted severe flu, resulting in more than 10,000 deaths and 180,000",

First, to minimize the mortality rate, life-threatening injuries should be properly and promptly treated as a priority. Second, potentially disabling injuries should be rapidly detected and treated to reduce functional impairment and ensure a quick return to normal life. Third, experienced health professionals should be assigned to provide trauma health care for people in need, which could increase the effectiveness and efficiency of treatment. Finally, the management models of disaster or public health emergencies should be developed focusing on the phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery, which could better ensure the various measures and assistance to victims conducted in an efficient, well-sequenced and coordinated manner.",

As the world is highly concerned with COVID-19, the additional influences of other traumatic events could be overlooked. Thus, research should explore the impact of these traumatic events occurring during the outbreak. Epidemiological surveys on mental disorders, trauma-informed care, professional help-seeking, and related barriers should be conducted among various populations affected by multiple traumatic events during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings may contribute to coordinating and aligning response programs and treatment models beyond national priorities. Finally, health authorities should consider the research and treatment programs used in previous public health emergencies e.g., SARS in 2003) and traumatic events (e.g., the 2008 Great Wenchuan Earthquake) to improve the response to the challenges due to traumatic events occurring contemporaneously with the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Online trauma-focused psychological support (e.g., psychological cyber-counseling, mental hotline, and smartphone-based mental treatment) should be provided for people in need. Second, to reduce negative feelings of uncertainty and insecurity, the government should ensure information transparency and timely updates on COVID-19 in addition to potentially traumatic events via media platforms(e.g., news channels, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and WeChat). Third, trauma influences not only the individual victim but also the whole family. Professional health workers are encouraged to provide more psychological support, guidance, treatment, intervention, and information about trauma via safe methods, as culturally appropriate. Finally, the International Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS, 2018) and American Psychological Association (APA, 2017) suggest to continually track the mental health status for survivors and provide well-timed evidence-based trauma-focused psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy, Cognitive Therapy, and Prolonged Exposure Therapy, when the situation has stabilized.",
