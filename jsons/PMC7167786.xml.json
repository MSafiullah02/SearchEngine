The effects of such control include post\u2010cleavage gain of function, loss of function or switching between functions. Proteases are thereby responsible for a multitude of physiological processes in all organisms 1. Classification of proteases is based on the amino acid at the catalytic site for substrate hydrolysis, which can either be serine, cysteine, threonine, aspartic or glutamic acid. For some proteases, the mode of action is mediated through coordination with a metal ion, so they are called metallopeptidases. Further classification is determined by the location of the protease cleavage site: proteases cutting at the amino terminus are called aminopeptidases, at the carboxyl terminus are called carboxypeptidases and towards the centre are called endopeptidases. Though uncommon, some proteases possess both endo\u2010 and exopeptidase function 2.",

A moonlighting protein, by simplest definition, is a protein capable of performing two or more distinct biological functions within a single polypeptide chain 9. It has been hypothesised that moonlighting functions arise from selective pressure on an advantageous novel function 10, and may benefit an organism by increasing complexity without resorting to genome expansion 11. To differentiate moonlighters from other multifunctional proteins, bone fide members do not encompass products of gene fusions, protein fragments, or splice variants 8. That is, whilst a proprotein can be cleaved to produce a protease and another functional unit, a moonlighting protease can exert both functions without prior processing. Additionally, moonlighting functions are not always conserved among the same protein across different organisms 12. Terminology used to describe the presence of more than one catalytic function in a protein molecule is not applied consistently in the literature 11, 13, 14. To clarify, bifunctional enzymes have two or more catalytic sites that function independently of each other; moonlighting proteins possess catalytic activity and an additional structural or regulatory function, while promiscuous enzymes have a single catalytic domain capable of catalysing more than one chemical reaction. These enzyme classifications are not exclusive \u2212 as some moonlighting proteases also have promiscuous and/or bifunctional activities.",

These intracellular proteins demonstrate additional functions when secreted or localised to the cell surface, and were originally termed anchorless or non\u2010classically secreted proteins as translocation occurred in the absence of any known signal peptide. The debate remains whether lysis or a novel secretion mechanism is responsible for the presence of cytosolic proteins on the cell surface 19.

Identification of additional functions of proteases and determination of their role in virulence remains a challenge. Such knowledge has implications for host\u2013pathogen interactions and drug design strategies. Global methods for identifying moonlighting proteins include bioinformatic analysis and mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analysis is better suited to identifying proteins that have evolved new function via the acquisition of additional domains rather than those that have acquired it via conformational changes. This is because there are currently no reliable prediction algorithms 21, no apparent moonlighting motifs 22 and no obvious links to sequence homology between moonlighting and non\u2010moonlighting proteins of the same class and between species 23. Furthermore, a moonlighting function can be introduced by as few as four amino acid substitutions 20. Detailed genomic comparisons of high and low virulence isogenic bacteria describe the accumulation of point mutations in surface accessible proteins 16, suggesting that minor sequence variation may have profound implications for protein function, including many moonlighting functions that are yet to be described. Mass spectrometric and proteomic analyses have been previously identified as key techniques in the search for moonlighting proteins due to their ability to identify the presence of a protein in varying cell types, locations and multiprotein complexes 24.",

Many report the presence of cytosolic proteins in extracellular fractions, providing tantalising suggestions of possible moonlighting function. Microbial proteases have established roles as virulence factors, yet the presence of traditionally cytosolic proteases within exoproteomes has generally been overlooked. Microbial proteases that have more than one function additional to proteolytic activity will form the focus of this review. Examples will be grouped into five main types of functions that the proteases have as additional to their proteolytic activity: adhesin, plasminogen\u2010binding, chaperone (Cpn), receptor, and non\u2010proteolytic catalysis. We will discuss how these additional functions may contribute to pathogenesis and point to future research directions by highlighting other potential moonlighters within microbial exoproteomes.",

This adherence is often facilitated by adhesive surface\u2010bound molecules called adhesins that bind to the ECM covering mucosal cells. ECM typically comprises a heterogeneous mixture of glycoproteins, such as collagen, elastin, fibronectin laminin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 31. These molecules are targeted by microbial adhesins to aid colonisation and invasion. There is also increasing evidence suggesting that microbial binding of ECM molecules elicits more than just adhesion. For example, fibronectin not only provides a bridge between the intracellular cytoskeleton and other ECM components, but is also involved in inflammation by augmenting chemotaxis and leucocyte function, cell signalling 32 and cell invasion 33. Fibronectin\u2010binding proteins are known virulence factors in important human pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus\n32, and Campylobacter jejuni fibronectin\u2010binding proteins have been implicated in membrane ruffling stimulation and consequent host cell invasion by activating the epidermal growth factor pathway 34. The co\u2010localisation of fibronectin and veterinary pathogen Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae on the ciliated lining of the porcine respiratory tract has also been demonstrated 35. GAG binding is also associated with more than adhesion, including facilitating intracellular survival in macrophages 36, and central nervous system entry 37. The importance of identifying microbial adhesins is highlighted by the drive to implement anti\u2010adhesion methods as novel therapeutics against infections, particularly within the context of ever increasing antibiotic resistance 38.",

The literature contains many examples of cytosolic proteins, particularly metabolic enzymes that moonlight on the cell surface, which may skew the perception of moonlighting to consideration of only multifunctional proteins found in atypical cellular compartments.

Laminin is targeted by many pathogens during the initial stages of adherence and during tissue invasion 40. Notably, experiments using cysteine protease inhibitors and inactive forms of SpeB have demonstrated that adhesion to glycoproteins was independent of proteolytic function. These data suggested that the adhesive motif and the substrate\u2010binding site are distinct entities 39. SpeB adhesive properties are essential during the initial stages of infection by group A Streptococcus; however, after systemic infection they become problematic due to their affinity for \u03b11 antitrypsin.

Plasmin is a proinflammatory agonist that dissolves fibrin clots, activates collagenase and gelatinase precursors, and degrades laminin 42.

Thus, Pla\u2010mediated laminin adhesion and plasminogen activation work together to produce localised proteolysis at the mammalian BM, facilitating Y. pestis invasion. Pla also binds the GAG heparan sulphate, and collagen 44, though the latter has been contested 45.

These functions include acting as an adhesin, receptor, co\u2010stimulatory protein and a role in apoptosis 54. The functions of DPPIV in microbes, moonlighting or otherwise, are less well established. However, DPPIV in P. gingivalis and Streptococcus suis is known to function as an adhesin. In P. gingivalis, DPPIV binds fibronectin and this interaction is required to establish colonisation 55. Fibronectin was not degraded by DPPIV and its binding was evident even in proteolytic inactive DPPIV mutants. Furthermore, binding fibronectin inhibited fibroblast recruitment and it was suggested that this could affect recovery from damage caused by inflammation 55. Similarly, DPPIV in S. suis bound fibronectin and the inactivation of the DPPIV gene caused a significant decrease in the pathogens cellular adhesion ability and impaired virulence 56. In the same study, mice that were vaccinated with purified DPPIV and challenged with a virulent strain of S. suis had a 100% survival rate after a week compared to a 100% mortality in the unvaccinated control group.",

Following contact activation by antigenic stimuli, a series of events occurs that ultimately results in the deposition of a fibrin mesh that captures invading pathogens and exposes them to bactericidal peptides released from platelets and kinins 60, 61. Once the infection has been cleared by leukocytes, the proenzyme plasminogen is cleaved by two serine proteases, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator, to release serine protease plasmin, which degrades the fibrin clot 62. Despite this formidable defence system, numerous bacteria have developed strategies to avoid fibrin clot confinement and subsequent immune clearance. One common mechanism involves the expression of surface proteins that bind plasminogen. These recruit host plasminogen to the cell surface and utilise host tPA and urokinase plasminogen activator to induce localised plasmin activity, thus facilitating fibrinolysis 60, 63. Interestingly, some of the most extensively characterised plasminogen\u2010binding proteins have been cytosolic or glycolytic pathway proteins localised to the cell surface by a yet unknown secretion mechanism 63. Several extracellular and intracellular proteases have been shown to bind plasminogen, including endopeptidase O (PepO) from Streptococcus pneumoniae, two aminopeptidases from M. hyopneumoniae and DPPIV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n64, 65, 66. PepO from S. pneumoniae\n65 and glutamyl aminopeptidase 66 and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) [67] from M. hyopneumoniae were shown to bind plasminogen in a dose\u2010dependent manner and that bound plasminogen was readily converted to plasmin in the presence of tPA. Notably, in the absence of tPA, these proteases did not directly cleave plasminogen to release plasmin. Adhesion was inhibited in the presence of a lysine analogue \u025b\u2010aminocaproic acid indicating a reliance on surface\u2010exposed lysine residues for plasminogen binding 68. Using a variety of complementing methodologies, including immunofluorescence, enzymatic shaving and surface biotinylation, all three proteases were found to be surface exposed despite the absence of any transmembrane domains, secretion motifs or signal peptides. Additionally, both M. hyopneumoniae aminopeptidases bound heparin, and the LAP also bound DNA, a moonlighting function shared with LAP from E. coli in which it has been linked to site\u2010specific recombination and transcriptional control of the carAB operon 69. PepO is a multifunctional adhesin by additionally binding fibronectin, and the inactivation of the pepO gene in S. pneumoniae was correlated with a significant decrease in epithelial invasiveness 65.",

            "text": "One reason that molecular Cpns have been a focus of moonlighting research is that despite traditionally thought to be intracellular proteins, many are expressed extracellularly and act as cell signalling proteins or in bacterial adherence to host cells 87. There is abundant evidence of Cpns functioning as chemoattractants and cytokine modulators 88. In prokaryotes, only four Cpns have thus far been shown to communicate with host cells \u2013 Cpn 60 (also known as HSP60 and GroEL), Cpn10 (HSP10), DnaK (HSP70) and peptidyloprolyl isomerase 15. Of particular interest is the Cpn60.2 mycobacterial molecular Cpn, the first identified Cpn with signalling properties 12. Cpn60.2 moonlights as an adhesin that facilitates alveolar macrophage entry by binding the transmembrane protein CD43 found on the surface of several immune effector cells 89. However, it has also become apparent that not all Cpn60.2 proteins possess the same moonlighting functions. A study using a murine asthma model found that out of the five Cpn60 proteins from various bacteria, only Cpn60.2 from Mycobacterium leprae had an anti\u2010inflammatory effect, despite 95% sequence identity with the M. tuberculosis Cnp60.2, which was also tested 12. Inhibition of inflammation and hyper\u2010responsiveness induced by M. leprae Cpn60.2 may be linked to the fact that this Cpn is the only Cpn60 protein with demonstrable proteolytic activity 90, since proteases are established modulators of innate immune responses. The proteolytic activity is catalytically related to HslV, which is the protease counterpart in the HslVU AAA+ protein degradation system mentioned above.",

The coronaviridae are a large family of viruses that can cause disease in both humans and other animals ranging from the common cold, the recently discovered Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Exopeptidases are the sole identified class of receptors required for the process of attachment and membrane fusion of coronaviruses within host tissues 92. The host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome is the metallocarboxypeptidase angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2. This receptor also binds the Human (H) CoV\u2010NL63 virus. Fibronectin\u2010binding DPP4 is a receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome 92. Perhaps the most well\u2010known example of a protease viral receptor is aminopeptidase N (also known as CD13), as it is targeted by a number of human, porcine, feline and canine CoVs, as well as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus 93.",

Furthermore, synergism occurs between viral and bacterial coinfections, particularly in the respiratory tract 94. Over the last ten years, it has been established that viral infections aid bacteria colonisation and dissemination through various means, including disrupting mucocilliary function 95, impairing immune effector cell function 96 and providing easy access to adhesin targets and nutrients via epithelial damage 97. As the respiratory tract is a reservoir to a number of pathobionts, one hypothesis is that these microbes secrete potential viral protease receptors or chemoattractants to enhance their own colonisation.",

Structural similarities of PLPs to deubiquitinating enzymes showed that PLPs not only function as deubiquitinating enzymes, but are also able to block induction of several endogenous proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN\u03b2, CCL5 and CXCL10 98. Another essential multifunctional viral protein is the hepatitis C virus NS3/4A, which possesses both chymotrypsin\u2010like serine protease and helicase activities in two individual domains.

This is interesting as the mechanics behind peptide and ester hydrolysis are dissimilar 100. Another enzyme capable of mechanistically diverse activities is the thioesterase I (TAP) of E. coli, which exhibits thioesterase, arylesterase, esterase, lysophospholipase and serine protease activities 102. However, despite an ability to interact with a great number of different substrates, the role of TAP in vivo is not yet well established. Finally, the extremophilic bacterial species Deinococcus radiodurans, Pyrococcus horikkoshii and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis all possess an enzyme that is both an aminoacylase (hydrolysing N\u2010acetylated amino acids) and a carboxypeptidase.
