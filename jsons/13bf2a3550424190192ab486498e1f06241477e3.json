SUMMARY: RPA is becoming a molecular tool of choice for the rapid, specific, and cost-effective identification of pathogens. Owing to minimal sample-preparation requirements, low operation temperature (25-42\u00b0C), and commercial availability of freeze-dried reagents, this method has been applied outside laboratory settings, in remote areas, and interestingly, onboard automated sample-to-answer microfluidic devices.

Polyethylene glycol is a macromolecule of high molecular weight shown to stimulate the interaction of RPA key proteins with DNA, by acting as a crowding agent. Creatine kinase uses phosphocreatine to generate ATP and fuel the enzymes of the system.

Recombinase disassembly from the nucleoprotein filament, induced by RecA protein hydrolyzing ATP, allows primer elongation by strand-displacing DNA polymerase.

Conventional probes such as Taq-Man cannot be used in RPA, and PCR Taq polymerases are not compatible with the amplification system either. The 5\u040833\u0408 exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase progressively digests the displaced strand during the strand displacement process, thus inhibiting DNA amplification. This explains the use of strand displacement polymerases in RPA that do not have the 5\u040833\u0408 exonuclease activity required for TaqMan probe detection (e.g., BsuDNA polymerase). The exo probe is a long oligonucleotide (46 -52 bases) bearing an internal base analog [e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF)] located between a fluorophore (e.g., FAM or TAMRA) and a quencher (e.g., Black Hole Quencher 1 or Black Hole Quencher 2) with a blocked 3\u0408 end (e.g., 3\u0408 phosphate group or dideoxynucleotide). This abasic residue serves as a substrate for E. coli exonuclease III that can cleave THF only after binding of the probe to the target sequence (10 ), thus separating the fluorophore from its quencher ( Fig. 2A) . Fluorescence generation typically yields a detectable signal within 5-10 min during the RPA reaction (6 ) . It should be noted that exonuclease cleavage generates a free 3\u0408-end of the exo probe, which is then extendable by polymerase enzyme serving as a forward primer (4 ) .

Therefore, the Nfo endonuclease can replace exonuclease III because both recognize the same substrate (i.e., THF residue). However, Nfo generates a lower signal and incomplete cleavage; limiting the degradation of amplicons allows amplicon detection by gel electrophoresis, an option not possible when using an exo probe (10 ) . For lateral flow assay, the reverse primer (opposing amplification primer) has a 5\u0408-biotin label and forms with the labeled nfo probe a double labeled amplicon which is then captured with species-specific anti-FAM antibody coupled to gold nanoparticles. Another immobilized antibody captures biotin, thus forming the detection line on commercially available strips (MGHD 1, TwistDx).

The turnaround time reflects the speed of the isothermal technology for generating results; ideally, the speed of the test should be less than 1 h (59 ). The incubation temperature is an important element because it is associated with the complexity of instrumentation required for isothermal amplification. In general, isothermal technologies operate at lower temperatures (e.g., 30 -42\u00b0C), thereby needing less power, especially because they do not require initial denaturation and cycling steps at 95\u00b0C. For instance, among the isothermal technologies listed in online Supplemental Table 2 , only 5 of 10 are completely isothermal. These techniques (helicase-dependent amplification, RPA, nicking enzyme amplification reaction, ribonuclease-mediated amplification, and cross-priming amplification) enable nucleic acid amplification at a single temperature throughout the reaction, thus alleviating the need for temperature fluctuation and control and simplifying instrumentation.

For postamplification detection methods, RPA uses agarose gel electrophoresis (approximately 60 min for results) or lateral-flow strips (20 -35 min) (Tables 2 and 3 ). By contrast, for LAMP the application of probe-based detection methods was not feasible because of the cauliflower-like structures of LAMP products (62 ) . Therefore, real-time LAMP detection is restricted to fluorescent dyes for detection. Other postamplification LAMP detection methods could rely on the naked eye because turbidity of the reaction mixture increases because of pyrophosphate by-product formation (63 ) . However, with end-point analysis (gel electrophoresis, lateral flow, or turbidimetry), as in the case of helicase-dependent amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, or LAMP, results required 60 -180 min depending on the assay (61 ) .
