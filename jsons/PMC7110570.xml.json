Emphasis has been placed on conditions unique to the species discussed herein.\u2022Mice and rats frequently present with varying forms of corneal opacification and deposits that may not be of clinical significance.\u2022Rodents are hypsodonts, with enamel extending past the gum line and a continuous growth of their teeth, making them highly susceptible to uneven wear and overgrowth that can be reflected in secondary ocular disease.\n\n",

Rodents are defined by their hypsodont dentition, with continuously growing incisors of the upper and lower jaw. The species discussed herein are domesticated from their wild counterparts for laboratory, farm, and pet purposes. The presence of inbred strains, most notably in mice and rats, must be considered when examining pet rodents, as many originate from laboratory strains. These genetic ocular defects are occasionally sought as models for human disease, but they can also be unwelcome byproducts linked to the desired trait. As social species that naturally live in colonies, herd management and individual welfare may be presented to the attending veterinarian. Mice, rats, and chinchillas are thought to be predominantly nocturnal to crepuscular, while guinea pigs are diurnal. Their eye anatomy reflects their origins. All rodents have a cornea divided into stratified epithelium, a Bowman layer (epithelial basement membrane), stroma, Descemet membrane, and the endothelium.",

They have also been noted to have an unusually low blink rate.2, 5 This is compounded by their typical housing, in a bedded enclosure with straw and hay at eye level. In a survey of 1000 guinea pigs, 4.7% had conjunctivitis, which was frequently secondary to a traumatic injury from a foreign body.11 This had also been seen in a previous survey of guinea pigs.1 It has been theorized that the corneal vessels and lymphoid tissue unique to guinea pigs eyes were an evolved strategy over increased blinking and discomfort seen in other animals. That being said, foreign bodies should still be taken seriously and treated promptly. Per Williams and Sullivan (2010), these foreign bodies, along with congenital trichiasis, seemed to be the most irritating for the animals.",

The presence of chromodacryorrhea should not be ignored, as it is not a normal finding. As discussed, it may be caused by environmental stress, physical illness, or underlying disease. Furthermore, even when not hypersecreted, porphyrins are labile until photic energy. Exposure to high-intensity light induced necrosis of the glandular cells in a study on a research population of Wistar rats.33 The injury appeared to be caused by the creation of free radicals within glandular cells, probably as a result of photodynamic action on the porphyrins in the gland.

A thorough ophthalmologic and histopathological study was performed on Fischer-344 (F344) rats that demonstrated a high incidence of corneal basement membrane dystrophy.34 In the most severely affected strains, this correlated to a systemic basement membrane disorder. It was speculated that these opacities are relatively under-reported for several reasons, and in this study anywhere from 50% to 100% of rats examined from various breeders had corneal dystrophy. Thankfully, these opacifications did not appear to cause the animals discomfort or have an adverse effect on normal physiologic function.
