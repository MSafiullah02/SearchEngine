            "text": "Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), is a popular freshwater fish species in China, Japan, Korea, East Europe, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Sakhalin and the basins of the largest Central Asian rivers Syr Darya and Amu Darya (Apalikova et al., 2011). Especially in China, Prussian carp farming has become an emerging industry in the province of Hubei, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shandong, Sichuan, Guangxi, Liaoning, etc., and has brought great profits in recent years. Annual production was nearly 2.2 million tonnes in 2010 (Ge and Miao, 2011). However, under intensive culture conditions, serious problems in Prussian carp hatcheries occur due to saprolegniosis caused by zoosporic oomycete fungi. During egg incubation, the oomycetes produce mycelia, which grow and spread from dead to healthy eggs thereby causing major economic losses (Noga, 1993; Cao et al., 2012a). More attention needs to be paid to control oomycete infections during incubation of the Prussian carp eggs.",

A few studies have been conducted on Saprolegnia species of rainbow trout, zebra fish, silver crucian carp, Pengze crucian carp and yellow catfish eggs (Ke et al., 2009; Mousavi et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2012a,b). However, no specific report is available for S. australis R. F. Elliott 1968 infection in Prussian carp and its eggs. Additionally, the control of saprolegniosis remains a worldwide problem after the effective malachite green treatment was banned.
