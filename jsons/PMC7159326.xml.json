Several features are common among all of these viruses in the transplant population:\nThe seasonality of respiratory viral infections among transplant recipients usually follows that of the general population 2, 3.The viruses all cause a range of disease, from mild congestion and rhinorrhea to more severe tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. No one virus is exclusively associated with one clinical syndrome (i.e. influenza\u2010like illness, croup, etc.). As such, diagnostic strategies should initially be broad, attempting to screen for all recognized viruses 3, 4 with particular emphasis on ones that might be amenable to therapy.Transplant recipients often present with mild or atypical symptoms and fever may be absent. Lung transplant recipients, for example, may initially only have subjective symptoms of shortness of breath or subtle changes in pulmonary function testing without more typical symptoms 5.Viral shedding is usually prolonged among transplant recipients. Prolonged shedding is seen even with the use of antivirals and therefore may contribute to the increased risk of resistant variant emergence 1, 6.Transplant recipients are at higher risk of infectious complications compared to immunocompetent hosts. Respiratory viral infections are a significant risk factor for subsequent development of fungal and bacterial pneumonia 1.Respiratory viral infections appear to be a risk factor for both acute and chronic rejection with the greatest risk in lung transplant recipients 5, 7, 8, 9 (II\u20102), although data on this topic in the literature are conflicting 10. The pathogenesis of the link between respiratory viral infections and rejection is not clearly understood.All pediatric solid organ and lung transplant recipients appear to have the greatest risk of both respiratory viral infections and more severe courses and complications 1.All are potential nosocomial pathogens that can be potentially spread by staff or visitor with mild upper respiratory illness.\n",

In general, all patients with presumed respiratory viral infection should have a nasopharyngeal swab, wash, or aspirate performed and sent for testing. If upper tract samples fail to document the cause of the respiratory illness or if there is clinical or radiologic evidence of lower tract involvement, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be considered and sent for the range of available tests.

Rapid antigen detection is available for influenza and RSV and has the advantage of rapid result testing (within 15\u2019). For influenza, rapid antigen detection testing has high specificity but variable sensitivity (20\u201370%) as compared to other assays, making them less useful in SOT recipients 11. Some commercial assays can distinguish between influenza A and B, but some others cannot. In the case of RSV, one study documented a sensitivity with one rapid test method of 15% for nasal wash specimens among immunocompromised patients; sensitivity is improved to 89% when BAL is used 12. Several studies of direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of primary patient specimens have documented sensitivity that approached that of PCR for certain viruses 13, 14. DFA testing is limited by lack of reagents for some of the viruses (hMPV, rhinovirus, coronavirus) 15. Although viral cultures previously were considered the preferred diagnostic tests, molecular tests tend to provide higher yields and can detect a wider range of viruses in a more timely fashion 1. For influenza, viral culture has the advantage of allowing the identification of the influenza strain and to test antiviral susceptibility 11.",

Influenza vaccination is an important measure to prevent influenza infection 33. Two types of influenza vaccine exist, the inactivated influenza vaccine and intranasal live\u2010attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). LAIV is contra\u2010indicated in SOT recipients and close contacts, due to a potential risk of dissemination of the vaccine strain. One dose of the seasonal intramuscular trivalent influenza vaccine is the standard of care in adults, and two doses 4 weeks apart is recommended for na\u00efve children <9 years of age 33. Immunogenicity of influenza vaccine is variable in SOT recipients, depending on the type of organ, immunosuppressive regimen used, and composition of the vaccine 34. However, there is increasing data reporting on the beneficial effects of influenza vaccination in SOT recipients. In lung transplant recipients, vaccination with adjuvanted influenza A H1N1/09 vaccine was associated with a reduced incidence of subsequent influenza infection (1.3% vs. 25% in unvaccinated patients)35. Influenza vaccination was also associated with a lower risk of graft loss and death in kidney transplant recipients 36. Even if vaccinated patients develop influenza, a reduction in the severity of the disease as compared to unvaccinated patients has been observed 37. Influenza vaccine is therefore recommended for all SOT recipients and household members 33 (Table 2).",

The optimal timing for vaccination after transplant has not been established. It is generally recommended to vaccinate at least 3 months post transplantation 33, although in this early period post transplant is when the risk of influenza\u2010associated complications is higher 28.

An intravenous form of oseltamivir and zanamivir is also available as investigational drug, but not currently approved. Intravenous peramivir, another neuraminidase inhibitor, is approved for its use in South Korea and Japan. None of these drugs has been specifically tested in prospective trials in SOT recipients for the therapy of influenza.

Most resistance in H1N1 viruses in patients exposed to oseltamivir is caused by the H275Y mutation, which results in increase IC50 for peramivir but retains activity of zanamivir 46. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors is uncommon in influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B viruses. Most commercially available resistance assays only detect H275Y and other mutations may occur, particularly when agents other than oseltamivir are used or influenza A/H3N2 or B are being treated.

Despite its FDA approval, convincing data describing the clinical efficacy of this agent are lacking and a consensus on the treatment of RSV disease does not currently exist 60, 62. Published data on the treatment of RSV disease in SOT recipients are limited and most of the data pertains to lung transplant recipients. Experience in stem cell transplant populations suggests that the use of aerosolized ribavirin may reduce mortality associated with severe RSV infections, particularly those affecting the lower airways 51, 61, 63. The combination of aerosolized ribavirin and antibody\u2010based interventions, including IgIV, RSV\u2010Ig, and palivizumab appeared to have an even greater impact on mortality 1, 64, 65.
