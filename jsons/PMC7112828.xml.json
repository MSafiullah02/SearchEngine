These outbreaks have led to a global influenza pandemic (Brownstein et al., 2009). Recent surveillance data show that the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 is co-circulating with seasonal influenza viruses in many countries (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pdf/External_F0939.pdf; http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_10_23/en/index.html). Because pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 and seasonal influenza transmit in a similar manner and present almost identical symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm), the control and prevention of this novel pandemic has been challenging. Critical for viral containment, surveillance, and treatment is the development of sensitive, accurate, and reliable diagnostic tests that can discriminate the H1N1 influenza virus from other strains.",

However, these assays are not able to type and subtype seasonal influenza viruses simultaneously. Another limitation of these rRT-PCR assays is that they only target the novel H1 gene of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus (Jiang et al., 2010, Whiley et al., 2009), resulting in a limited specificity that can result in false-negative diagnosis when sequence variations exist in the primer- or probe-targeted genes. In addition, there has been a report of some cross-reactivity between the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus and the influenza A virus H5N1 when using the US CDC's rRT-PCR assay, which is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Peacey et al., 2009). The development of an rRT-PCR assay with improved sensitivity, specificity, and performance, as well as the ability to distinguish pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 from seasonal influenza viruses would be most useful.",

Other primers and probes for the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus and for seasonal influenza viruses such as human H1N1 and H3N2 were designed based on the sequence data obtained from the Influenza Virus Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/) (Table 1\n). Primers/probes for typing of the viral strains were designed to target the conserved regions of the M gene segment for the influenza A virus and of the NP gene segment for the influenza B virus. Primers/probes for subtyping of viral strains were designed to target the HA gene segment for each of the three HA subtypes (H1-consensus, H1-pandemic A/H1N1 2009 and H3) and the NA gene segment for each of the three NA subtypes (N1-consensus, N1-pandemic A/H1N1 2009 and N2). In silico coverage of primers/probes was calculated using an in-house program based on work described previously (Bose et al., 2009), with some modifications. Briefly, a sequence was defined as a \u201chit\u201d if there were two or less substitutions within the probe, or if there were no substitutions within five bases from the 3\u2032 end; one or less substitutions within 10 bases from the 3\u2032 end; or three or less substitutions within the primers. For degenerate primers or probes, an acceptable \u201chit\u201d was defined by the presence of an accurate match between the sequence data consensus (made by BioEDIT 7.01 software) and its primers or probes.",

Briefly, 2 \u03bcL of nucleic acid solution was added to 23 \u03bcL of master mix containing the following components at the indicated final concentrations: 1\u00d7 reaction buffer, 1 \u03bcL of SuperScript\u2122 III RT/Platinum\u00ae Taq Mix, 500 nM of each primer, and 300 nM of the probe labelled at the 5\u2032 end with a reporter dye and at the 3\u2032 end with a non-fluorescent quencher based on the four sets of multiplex rRT-PCR assays (Table 1). Thermocycling was carried out as follows: 30 min at 50 \u00b0C and 3 min at 95 \u00b0C for reverse transcription (RT) and denaturation; five pre-cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, at 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, and at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; followed by 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, and at 55 \u00b0C for 40 s. The multiplex rRT-PCR assay was performed on a CFX 96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA). The baseline fluorescence threshold for each analysis was manually adjusted based on the background fluorescence of the \u2018no template\u2019 control reaction using the Baseline Subtracted Curve Fit analysis mode in Bio-Rad CFX Manager Software. For each analysis, a sample amplification curve exceeding baseline fluorescence with a corresponding CT (Cycle threshold) value (not exceeding 36 in a 40-cycle run) was considered as positive. In addition, a CT value between 36 and 40 was considered as weakly positive. An amplification curve lower than the baseline fluorescence was defined as negative.",

Copies of RNA extracts of the three known and 11 unknown subtypes of influenza A virus strains were quantified by SYBR green rRT-PCR. Quantification was done using a standard curve made by serial dilutions of pGEM-NP, a plasmid containing a partial NP gene of influenza A virus (data not shown). The limits of detection (LODs) were determined using 10-fold serial dilutions (108\u20131 copies/reaction or 1.8 \u00d7 104 to 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 TCID50/mL) of the quantified viral RNA extracts and of the plasmids cloned with genes of influenza A viruses including H1-2009, N1-2009, H1, N1, H3, N2, and M. In addition, another five clinical respiratory specimens positive for influenza B virus (#426A), influenza C virus (#828A), adenovirus (#8313), human metapneumovirus (hMPV; #1152A) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3; #2722) were recruited for the cross-reaction assay. Viral RNA extracts were tested at high concentrations (108 copies/reaction above the LOD) (Table 2) to determine the analytical specificity of the rRT-PCR assay. Other respiratory viral nucleic acid extracts including influenza B virus, coronavirus OC43 and adenovirus were tested at high TCID50s (Table 2). The analytical reproducibility assay was calculated at a degree of dilution of 105 copies/reaction (3.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 TCID50/reaction for influenza B virus). All of the analytical assays were run at least three times and each run was performed on different days. Inter-assay and intra-assay variability (coefficient of variation, CV), both measures of the reproducibility of the rRT-PCR assays, was determined by the following formula:CV(%)=SD   CTsMean   CTs\u00d7100%SD CTs: standard deviation of CT values; Mean CTs: mean CT values.",

            "text": "The newly developed multiplex rRT-PCR system has several advantages over other assays for detection of influenza viruses. First, it is more sensitive than conventional PCR assays in subtyping influenza A viruses (P\n = 6.15 \u00d7 10\u22125 compared with seasonal influenza A virus detection; and P\n = 8.74 \u00d7 10\u22124 for H1N1 subtyping). The analysis of the LOD for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus indicates that the strategy of multiple-targeting detection ensures the sensitivity of the assay system and effectively lowers the false-negative rate. Second, owing to the de-novo design of primers/probes for two target genes (H1-2009 and N1-2009 of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, and H3 and N2 of the H3N2 subtype, etc.), the multiplex rRT-PCR assay is specific for the detection of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus (Fig. 1A) and that of the H3N2 subtype (Fig. 1C and Fig. 2A). As shown here, one sample identified as pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 by the US CDC's rRT-PCR assay was confirmed to be the H3N2 subtype by the new assay. Based on sequence alignment, the H1-2009 primers/probes had very low homologies with that for H3N2 (Fig. 2B). However, there were high homologies between the SW H1 primers/probes of the US CDC's rRT-PCR and some H3N2 strains (such as A/Hong Kong/1-9-MA21-3/1968, a strain that is highly homologous to the sequencing product of this test). In particular, the SW H1 reverse primer has eight continuous matches with HA sequences found at the 3\u2032 end in H3N2, an important terminal site for primer specificity (Kwok et al., 1990, Peacey et al., 2009) (Fig. 2C). Third, in the new multiplex rRT-PCR system, the consensus primers/probes cover the majority of HA and NA sequences of each human influenza A subtype (H1, H3, N1 and N2) found in the Influenza Virus Resource database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/) (Table 3). This allows the new assay to identify a wide range of influenza subtypes, as seen in Table 6, Table 2, which present data for subtyping 105 randomly selected influenza A virus positive samples collected between January 2007 and December 2008, and 11 influenza A virus isolates of unknown subtypes. Fourth, the new multiplex rRT-PCR assay is highly flexible, as primers/probes can be easily adapted for the detection of some other or newly occurring subtypes of influenza viruses. This adaptation would make the multiplex rRT-PCR a useful platform for the simultaneous detection and surveillance of multiple influenza viruses and/or possibly other pathogens.",
