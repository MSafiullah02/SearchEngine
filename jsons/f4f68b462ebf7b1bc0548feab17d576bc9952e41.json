Methods and Results: Conserved regions in the haemagglutinin genes of avian influenza viruses subtype H5 served as targets for the primers and TaqMan-MGB probe design. Concentrations of primers and probe were optimized to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the reactions. A plasmid containing the haemagglutinin gene was constructed and in vitro transcribed for a quantitative assay of copy numbers of the target gene. The results revealed that the optimal concentration of primers and probe was 640 and 480 nmol l )1 , respectively. The threshold of 100 copies of target molecules could be detected. The linear range for detection was determined as 10 2 to 10 8 molecules in reaction. Conclusions: It took less than 3 h to complete the detection from viral RNA extraction, with good sensitivity and repeatability. Significance and Impact of the Study: Real-time RT-PCR assay with MGB probe was an effective means for quick and quantitative laboratory detection and monitoring of H5 avian influenza viruses.",

            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is one of the most severe diseases communicable in birds. HPAI infection results in acute diseases with high morbidities and mortalities. Recent outbreaks and researches have revealed that HPAI could break through the species barrier to infect humans with high mortalities. The first outbreak was documented in Hong Kong in 1997 with 18 human cases including six fatalities (Yuen et al. 1998; Chan 2002) . Since its reemergence from 2003 in Southeast Asia, 172 people have died from HPAI infection (WHO 2006) . HPAI is becoming a serious threat to public health because of its fast genetic variation and increasing adaptation to humans. The establishment of rapid and reliable methods for H5 avian influenza virus detection is of great value for the control and prevention of HPAI.",

Real-time monitoring of amplified products cycleby-cycle and direct virus quantification can be performed using this method. All the procedures were carried out in high containment conditions, and cross-contaminations among samples and false-positive results were therefore greatly avoided. The newly developed technique of minor groove binder (MGB) probe for diagnosis of virus infection has additional advantages over the traditional Taq-Man probes (Fernandez et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2005; Lole and Arankalle 2006) . The MGB technique can enlarge the difference in T m values between the target template and other nonspecific nucleic acids, to obtain high specificity. The MGB probe can also improve hybridization stability and reduce the fluorescence background to obtain high sensitivity. In this report, TaqMan-MGB real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect H5-specific nucleic acids.",

The amplified fragment was recovered from agarose gel and ligated with pGEM-T vector. The DH5a competent cells were transformed with ligation mixture and spreaded on an LB plate containing ampicillin. Escherichia coli colonies were picked up and positive clones were identified using PCR amplification. Sequencing analysis was conducted to further confirm the insertion of HA gene. The concentration of recombinant plasmid DNA was determined by absorbance of UV light at 260 and 280 nm. The plasmid was then linearized at the SalI site and 5 lg DNA was used as template in an in vitro transcription reaction with the Riboprobe System using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). After the in vitro transcription reaction at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the DNA was digested by DNase I at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The purified RNA was quantified with a spectrophotometer.

Reactions with copy numbers of target gene from 10 2 to 10 8 were used for creating the standard curve. The standard curve was plotted by the log concentration of copy numbers against C t values. cation in the control and prevention of HPAI outbreaks. There have been several papers describing the real-time RT-PCR detection of influenza viruses. Some have described the simultaneous detection of influenza A, including H5N1, while others described the subtyping of H5 influenza virus (Ng et al. 2005; Whiley and Sloots 2005; Payungporn et al. 2006; Wen et al. 2006) . In this report, a rapid diagnosis of H5 avian influenza was implemented using TaqMan-MGB real-time RT-PCR. The method combined a quick and sensitive detection of the nucleic acids of H5 avian influenza, and a threshold of 100 copies could be detected. Specificity was also improved by the fluorescent probe. Electrophoresis of amplified fragments was substituted by the direct fluorescence detection during the PCR process and the duration of detection was reduced. The newly developed TaqMan-MGB probe is more stable and can improve signal-to-noise ratios due to the use of a non-fluorescent quencher instead of the fluorescent quencher dye (Afonina et al. 2002) . The combination of MGB stabilizes the hybridization of the probe and the T m value is about 10\u00b0C higher than conventional TaqMan probes. As a result, short oligonucleotides of about 15 nucleotides can be used for hybridization and therefore confer more options in the optimization of probe sequence. The MGB technique also has an advantage in the discrimination of mismatched nucleotide during hybridization (Lew et al. 2004 ). The specificity of detection using the MGB-labelled probe was similar to that obtained by non-MGB fluorescent probes, but more sensitivity was obtained when the MGB technique was employed in the detection of H5 avian influenza. One hundred molecules of external standard were detectable using the 16-bp MGB probe specific for the H5 gene. The sensitivity was higher than using a conventional TaqMan probe which was obtained as 10 3 -10 4 copies (Spackman et al. 2002) . In a previous study, the primers and MGB probe were designed based on the matrix gene sequences from animal and human influenza A viruses (Di Trani et al. 2006 ). In the present report, the HA sequences of various H5 type avian influenza viruses isolated from birds or humans were downloaded for the primer and probe design. To ensure the detection of various subtypes of H5 avian influenza viruses and to give evidence for pathogen tracing, degenerate primers were designed and proved to be sensitive and specific for laboratory detection.",
