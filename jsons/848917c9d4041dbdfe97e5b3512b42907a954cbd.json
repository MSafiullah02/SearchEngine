To further assist in microbial identi fi cation, nucleic acid ampli fi cation has been introduced in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Such testing was initially done for viruses, allowing detection of small amounts of viral nucleic acid quickly. Similar tests also have been applied to bacteria, especially those that require cell cultures, are dif fi cult to grow on routine culture media, or are slow growing such as Chlamydia , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , and Mycobacterium .

We must pay attention to the technical progress of the nucleic acid extraction as well as to the method for ampli fi cation and detection of nucleic acids in order to obtain satisfactory results. Nucleic acid extraction consists of three major processes: isolation, puri fi cation, and concentration. Commercial extraction kits are commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory [ 2 ] . These kits provide the essential requirements for nucleic acid extraction. These essential requirements have been well described by Boom et al. [ 6, 7 ] as follows: Extraction should be simple, rapid, and should show high sensitivity and speci fi city. It is preferred that there be no requirements for specialized equipment or special knowledge and skills. The fi nal nucleic acid should be pure and easy to modify for various ampli fi cation techniques. The reagents and their product should be harmless, and the process of preparation should resist contamination with other specimens. If the fi nal volume of eluate is small, detection limits are maximized. When we deal with clinical specimens, we also should consider the elimination of potential inhibitors of the DNA polymerase and the removal of pathogenicity from hazardous pathogens as well as good target recovery and establishment of the integrity of nucleic acid targets [ 2 ] . Ideally, the fi nal target is pure nucleic acid without ampli fi cation inhibitors or contaminants such as protein, carbohydrate, and other nucleic acids [ 8 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 160, "text": "[ 1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 161, "end": 164, "text": "5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 311, "end": 315, "text": "[ 3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 316, "end": 319, "text": "4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 708, "end": 713, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 860, "end": 864, "text": "[ 6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 865, "end": 868, "text": "7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1650, "end": 1655, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1817, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "There are a few points to be specially considered when we consider the use of nucleic acid extraction in the fi eld of clinical microbiology. Usually, we extract DNA or RNA, and some times, we may extract both, depending on the circumstances. The targets for nucleic acid extraction are diverse. They can be the cultured bacterial isolates themselves. Alternatively, we can use culture media, including blood culture bottles or various clinical specimens such as sputum, stool, urine, tissue, or cerebrospinal fl uid [ 1 ] . In terms of nucleic acid extraction, they may target the same nucleic acid, but they have different implications for the extraction procedure itself. Nucleic acid extraction from cultured bacteria is relatively simple because they are pure colonies and they contain large numbers of organisms. However, we need to recognize that gram-positive bacteria have thick walls, such that nucleic acid extraction is more dif fi cult than it is from gram-negative bacteria, which have thinner walls [ 5 ] . For clinical specimens, the details of the method depend on the characteristics of each specimen. It is important to remember that the subject is nucleic acid, not of humans, but of bacteria, virus, or fungus. If we extract from clinical specimens containing human cells, we cannot help mixing human DNA and sometimes, recovery of microbial DNA can be diminished by the presence of human DNA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 522, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1019, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Since 1950, density gradient centrifugation using cesium chloride (CsCl)/ethidium bromide (EtBr) has been used as for DNA extraction method and has become standard in research laboratories [ 9, 10 ] .

For example, each DNA can be separated as independent bands as a result of the differences in each DNA's density in the gradient by the intercalation of EtBr [ 7 ] .

The process consists of vigorous mixing of phenol-chloroform solution and sample followed by centrifugation [ 7 ] . Phenol does not completely inhibit RNase activity, and this characteristic enables isolation of nucleic acid by combination with chloroform and alcohol [ 12 ] . After centrifugation, the upper (aqueous) phase containing the DNA can be separated from the lower (organic) phase containing denatured proteins, and DNA can be precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol with a high concentration of salt [ 8 ] . After washing with 70% ethanol to remove any remaining ethanol or isopropanol, the fi nal target DNA is collected by dissolving it in TE buffer or sterile distilled water [ 13 ] . This method is also used for RNA extraction by concomitant use of guanidinium isothiocyanate. This combination can overcome the limitation of RNA extraction using the guanidinium isothiocyanate itself, so RNA could be isolated conveniently using a single-step technique by Chomczynski et al. [ 12, 14 ] . Total RNA is recovered by precipitation with isopropanol after separation of the upper phase containing the total RNA from the lower phase containing DNA and proteins [ 12, 14 ] . Although the phenol-chloroform method is relatively easy compared with CsCl/EtBr and is very useful for the extraction of nucleic acids, it is problematic for the clinical microbiology laboratory because phenol has important limitations due to it being toxic, caustic, and fl ammable [ 5, 15, 16 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 158, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 313, "end": 319, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 563, "end": 568, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 742, "end": 748, "text": "[ 13 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1048, "text": "[ 12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1053, "text": "14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1228, "text": "[ 12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1233, "text": "14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1524, "text": "[ 5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1528, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1533, "text": "16 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phenol-Chloroform Extraction"}, {"text": "McCormick et al. introduced a new DNA extraction method involving solid-phase extraction in 1989 [ 17 ] .

The function of this siliceous core particle is similar to that of phenol, but it has a few advantages in that it is safer, and cross-contamination can be reduced. It is well known that the precipitation in the phenol/chloroform method causes DNA loss, and Meijer et al. could reduce it by replacing the precipitating step with silica particles [ 18 ] . Solid-phase nucleic acid extraction was incorporated into many commercial kits, and it still is the basis of many extraction methods, although siliceous core particles have been replaced by other materials such as silica matrices, glass particles, diatomaceous earth, and anion-exchange carriers ( Fig. 11 .1 ) [ 7 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 103, "text": "[ 17 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 525, "end": 531, "text": "[ 18 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 845, "end": 850, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 832, "end": 839, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Solid-Phase Extraction"}, {"text": "Solid-phase extraction uses a spin column operated by centrifugal force allowing DNA to be puri fi ed rapidly and ef fi ciently without the limitations of liquid extraction, including incomplete phase separation [ 8 ] .

[ 6 ] used an innovative approach in which diatomaceous earth served as a matrix for solid-phase extraction. The principle of this method is that it immobilizes DNA onto its particles in the presence of a chaotropic agent. The technique can purify rRNA as well as single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. It takes only a short time and can be applied to clinical specimens as well as to DNA and bacteria. The process of solid-phase extraction involves cell lysis, nucleic acid adsorption, washing, and elution [ 7, 8 ] . Column conditioning is obtained using a buffer at a particular pH [ 19 ] . The nucleic acid will be released after cell lysis and decanting of lysis buffer into the column. Nucleic acid adsorption is completed in a chaotropic salt solution [ 19 ] . Washing buffer contains a competitive agent and can remove contaminants such as proteins and salts.

The magnetic bead method is very simple and convenient; so many commercial kits are available for this method [ 8 ] . Some manufacturers combined the techniques of solid-phase extraction using silica and magnetic beads, which satis fi es the customers' requests for time-and labor-effectiveness and ef fi ciency ( Fig. 11 .2 ).
