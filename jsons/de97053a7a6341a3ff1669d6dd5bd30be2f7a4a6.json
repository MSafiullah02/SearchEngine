[1] [2] [3] [4] In response, the Emergency Department at Sengkang General Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Singapore, began actively inquiring about acute olfactory loss (hyposmia or anosmia of less than 14 days' duration) from 23 Apr 2020 in all patients who presented with acute respiratory symptoms, and in those who fulfilled the prevailing Ministry of Health (MOH) suspect or surveillance case definition. We then performed a cohort study to evaluate the utility of acute olfactory loss as a risk-stratifying tool for Covid-",
