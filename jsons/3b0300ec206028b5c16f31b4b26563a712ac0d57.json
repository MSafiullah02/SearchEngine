            "text": "Enveloped viruses enter cells by fusing their lipid bilayer membrane with a cellular membrane. They bear on their surface oligomers of a fusion protein, often part of a polypeptide that performs other functions, such as receptor binding. Most viral fusion proteins require priming by proteolytic processing, either of the fusion protein itself or of an accompanying protein. The priming step, which often occurs during transport of the fusion protein to the cell surface but may also occur extracellularly, then prepares the fusion protein for triggering by events that accompany attachment and uptake. For example, proton binding is frequently such a trigger, which provides the virus with a mechanism for detecting that it has arrived in the low-pH milieu of an endosome.",

It is believed to pass through an intermediate known as a \"hemifusion stalk\" (Fig. 1B) (Markin et al., 1984; Siegel, 1993) . In this intermediate, the two apposed leaflets have fused, but not the distal ones. Hemifused bilayers can proceed to form a \"fusion pore\" (Fig. 1D ) or form a structure in which the two distal leaflets create a single bilayer. This state, which can spread laterally, is called a \"hemifusion diaphragm\" (Fig. 1E ). Bilayers do not fuse spontaneously (e.g., concentrated liposomes are quite stable), because the reaction in Fig. 1 has a high activation barrier, both at the step between the precursor bilayers and the hemifusion stalk and at the step between the hemifusion stalk and the fusion pore. A newly opened pore appears to revert frequently to a hemifusion structure (\"flickering\"), and the largest kinetic barrier may be for the step in which the pore dilates rather than reverts. Once the fusion pore has dilated, the fused stucture is stable with respect to the initial, unfused structure.",

Receptor binding does not induce any significant conformational changes in HA. It merely attaches the virus to the cell surface and allows capture by endocytic vesicles.

Most strains of influenza A have a critical pH of about 5-5.5, corresponding to the pH of a relatively late endosomal compartment.

(1) The HA 1 receptor-binding domains separate from each other. Because HA 1 is linked to HA 2 by a disulfide bond, it cannot dissociate completely, but the final conformation of HA 2 requires that HA 1 FIG 2. The influenza virus hemagglutinin. (A) HA 0 , before cleavage between HA 1 and HA 2 . The HA 1 part of the protein is blue; the HA 2 part, is purple. The fusion peptide, looped out before cleavage, is yellow. The sialic acid-binding site and the cleavage point are shown by blue and yellow arrows, respectively. (B) The mature HA after cleavage but before low-pH triggering. The only change from the structure in (A) is insertion of the fusion peptide (the N terminus of HA 2 , in yellow) into a crevice along the three-fold axis (dark yellow asterisk). A purple arrow points to the loop between the shorter, N-proximal helix and the longer, central helix. A purple asterisk indicates the position of residues that will move to the top of the molecule during the low pH-induced transition. (C) HA 2 after exposure to low pH. The same structure can be obtained by refolding HA 2 expressed in E. coli. It is the minimal free-energy state of HA 2 unconstrained by covalent association with HA 1 . The long loop in the prefusion structure (purple arrow in [B] ) has now become helical, elevating the N terminus of the protein (the fusion peptide itself is not included in this structure) to the top of the molecule (purple asterisk). A break and reversal of direction in the central -helix of the prefusion trimer likewise projects the C terminus of the protein to the top. The figure is aligned with respect to (B) so this break is roughly at the same height in both panels. In the actual transition, the chain reversal is likely to occur by melting and rezipping of the C-terminal helical segment, as shown in Fig. 3C . For detailed references, see Skehel and Wiley (2000) . move away from the threefold axis to allow HA 2 to form new threefold contacts. (2) HA 2 straightens by a loop-to-helix transition of a segment previously tucked beneath HA 1 (Bullough et al., 1994; Carr and Kim, 1993) . This rearrangement thrusts the N-terminal fusion peptide up (using the coordinates of Fig. 2 as a reference for \"up\" and \"down\"), where it can encounter the membrane of the target cell. The extended intermediate, with fusion peptides inserted into the target cell membrane, may have a lifetime of seconds to minutes. (3) The long helix of HA 2 breaks and reverses direction, and the distal part of the HA 2 chain Receptor binding (shown here for HIV or SIV Env, where the schematic receptor and coreceptor symbolize CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5). (B) Dissociation of the receptorbinding domain (in the case of HA, a disulfide bond prevents complete dissociation, but the structural rearrangement requires that HA 1 move away from the threefold axis) and projection of the fusion peptide toward the target cell membrane. This state is known as the \"prefusion intermediate\" (or, sometimes, the \"prehairpin intermediate\"). The arrows show the positions along the core helical bundle at which, on HIV-1 gp41, the inhibitor peptides T-20 and C34 are expected to bind. (C) Folding back of the C-terminal part of the molecule. This zipping up of a segment of the fusion protein sometimes designated \"helical region 2\" (HR2); helical region 1 (HR1) forms the inner core of the postfusion trimer) draws the two membranes together as the N-terminal fusion peptide, inserted into the target cell membrane, and the C-terminal transmembrane segment, which is anchored in the viral membrane, are forced by the refolding to approach each other. (D) Hemifusion stalk formation. Provided that they insert only into the outer leaflet of the bilayer, the fusion peptides can migrate into the stalk, as proposed here, and stabilize it. (E) Fusion pore formation. Hemifusion structures flicker transiently into unstable pores, which reseal. The pore can be trapped by the final refolding step, in which the three transmembrane segments snap into place around the inserted fusion peptides. In the case of HA, this step may be driven by formation of a set of interactions that cap the inner core helices. zips up along the stem formed by long central helix, which now runs from the fusion peptide to the breakpoint. In its final conformation, the HA 2 ectodomain has its N terminus, which bears the fusion peptide, adjacent to its C terminus, which leads to the transmembrane anchor (Chen et al., 1999) . In other words, the two membrane-interacting segments on each chain are next to each other. Thus, assuming that all three fusion peptides insert into the target membrane and that the C-terminal transmembrane segments remain anchored in the viral membrane, the zipping up of the distal part of HA 2 will drag the two membranes together (Fig. 3) .",

The amino acid sequence of the loop in HA 2 has a particularly strong helical coiled-coil signature, and peptides with this sequence form stable coiled coils in solution (Carr and Kim, 1993) . Release of the constraints imposed on the conformation of this peptide by HA 1 is therefore likely to lead to coiled-coil formation and translocation of the fusion peptide away from the base of the trimer. The phrase \"spring-loaded\" has been used to describe this mechanism (Carr and Kim, 1993) . Experiments with target membranes containing photoactivatable cross-linking reagents demonstrate insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, probably before fusion (Tsurudome et al., 1992) . A peptide having the amino acid sequence of the first 20 residues of HA 2 forms a gently kinked, amphipathic helix in the presence of detergent micelles (Han et al., 2001) . On a membrane, this structure would lie partially embedded in the outer monolayer, with the two ends dipping somewhat more deeply into the bilayer outer leaflet than the apex of the kink. That is, the fusion peptide probably inserts only into the proximal leaflet of a membrane lipid bilayer. The effects of mutations in the fusion peptide vary with position (Qiao et al., 1999; Steinhauer et al., 1995) . They do not correlate in any simple way with the structure just described, but it may be difficult to deconvolute the requirements for its conformation in the mature HA 1 -HA 2 trimer from those for productive membrane insertion.",

The best evidence for an extended \"prefusion intermediate,\" with the fusion peptides inserted into the target cell membrane but with the C-terminal parts of the fusion protein still at the opposite end of the molecule, comes from work on HIV-1 gp41 (Furuta et al., 1998; Rimsky et al., 1998 ) (see later). In the mature HA trimer at neutral pH, the long axial helices diverge from each other at about the position at which the folding back occurs (Fig. 2B ,C), and it is plausible that in the extended intermediate, the \"lower\" part of the molecule is unstable and locally unfolded. There has been some confusion in the literature about the folding back process. Although the expressions \"fold back\" and \"jack-knifing\" have been used to describe the conformational change, the only way it can plausibly occur in practice is by melting at least some of the C-terminal segments of the HA 2 ectodomain and zipping up these segments along the central core (Fig. 3 ). If the links between the fusion peptides and the central core are flexible, then the zipping process will necessarily displace the position of the chain reversal (the fold-back point) laterally, away from the constriction. During the transition from the extended intermediate to the folded-back conformation, threefold symmetry is broken; it is restored only in the final, postfusion structure.",

A noteworthy feature of the rearranged structure of HA 2 ectodomain is a tight \"cap,\" formed by the way the Cterminal part of the polypeptide chain associates with the N-terminal end of the central, three-helix bundle ( Fig. 2C ) (Chen et al., 1999) . This cap is likely to snap the folded-back conformation into place. In the model for the fusion reaction diagrammed in Fig. 3 , the final step involves stabilization of the fusion pore by interposition of the transmembrane anchors of HA 2 . Formation of the HA 2 cap may be a critical feature of this step. When HA is linked to a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor or to a truncated transmembrane anchor that does not cross the bilayer, it catalyzes hemifusion quite readily, but it promotes fusion poorly, if at all (Kemble et al., 1994; Melikyan et al., 1995) . Catalyzing fusion does not require a specific structure or amino acid sequence on the inside of the membrane; the transmembrane anchor must simply traverse the bilayer completely (Armstrong et al., 2000) . Truncation of the SV5 fusion protein produces a similar result (Dutch and Lamb, 2001) . Snapping the HA 2 cap into place and dragging the cytosolic end of the transmembrane anchor into a newly opened pore will prevent the pore from resealing (which it will otherwise tend to do) and force the fusion reaction to proceed to completion.",

With the exception of the added esterase module, the protein is recognizably similar to the HA of influenza A (Rosenthal et al., 1998) (Fig. 4) . The esterase domain resembles in structure other acetyl hydrolases. In the amino acid sequence, it falls in two partsone at the N-terminal end of the sialic acid-binding domain and the other at the C-terminal end. That is, the receptor-binding domain is an insert into the esterase, which in turn is an insert between the N-and C-terminal segments of HEF 1 . One can thus imagine that the N-and C-terminal segments of HEF 1 (or HA 1 ) and the entirety of HEF 2 (or HA 2 ) constitute an elementary fusion module, into which other functions have been inserted in the course of evolution (Rosenthal et al., 1998; Skehel and Wiley, 2000) .

The N-and C-terminal segments of HEF 1 and all of HEF 2 (except for the fusion peptide) are in red. The acetylase enzymatic domain (E1 \u00fe E 00 \u00fe E2) is in green; the receptor-binding domain (R) is in blue. Think of the red fragments as an elementary fusion protein and the green and blue fragments as insertions. In HA, most of the acetylase domain has been deleted, except for the E 0 fragment, which becomes an adaptor to connect the elementary fusion protein with the receptor-binding domain.

Both structures correspond to postfusion states (or at least to posttriggering states). Both structures are also of molecules truncated in important ways to facilitate structural studies. Thus, the gp120 \"core\" that has been crystallized (in complex with CD4 and the Fab from mAb 17b) is simply the receptor-and coreceptor-binding element, stripped of nonessential variable loops and lacking N-and C-terminal segments. These terminal segments of gp120 can be thought of as part of the basic fusion module, by analogy with influenza A HA and influenza C HEF (Pollard et al., 1992) (Fig. 6) .

The rearrangements in gp120 that initiate the process are probably quite extensive (Myszka et al., 2000) . The receptor-binding core folds into two domains, termed \"inner\" and \"outer\" (Fig. 7) . One hairpin loop from each of these FIG 5. States of the HIV-1 envelope protein, as detected by biochemical, immunological, physicochemical, and structural analyses. The trimeric gp160 precursor is cleaved by a furin-like protease to gp120 and gp41, which retain their threefold association. Binding of CD4 (one per trimer may be sufficient, but the degree of cooperativity is not determined) induces a conformational change in gp120 (gp120 \u2020 ); binding of a suitable chemokine receptor (chR) may induce or lock in a further change (gp120 \u2021 ). Ultimately gp120 is probably shed from the gp41 stem (gp120*). Once liberated, the gp41 trimer undergoes a two-stage, fusion-inducing conformational change: a transition to an extended, prefusion intermediate, (gp41 \u2020 ) 3 , with the fusion peptide inserted into the target cell membrane, followed by a folding back to form the final, trimer-of-hairpins structure (gp41*) 3 , generating membrane fusion in the process. domains contributes to the \"bridging sheet,\" a sheet that locks the relative positions and orientations of the two domains and that creates the site for coreceptor interaction. It has been suggested that the bridging sheet is not present before encounter with CD4 and that receptor binding locks the sheet into place . The inner and outer domains could thus have quite different relative orientations in the precursor conformation. The inner domain contains both N and C termini of the gp120 core. They are essentially adjacent to each other in the structure, consistent with the notion that the receptor-binding element is an insert into an elementary fusion module (compare with Fig. 4) .",

The inner core is quite insoluble, and a more efficient way to study this mode of inhibition is to cover two of its three grooves with outer layer peptides, allowing one groove free to capture an outer layer segment from gp41 as it refolds. A single-chain version of such a structure (in which three inner layer segments, interspersed with two outer layer segments, have been concatenated with suitable short linkers) is indeed an effective inhibitor of gp41-mediated fusion and of HIV-1 infectivity (Root et al., 2001) .",

During flavivirus infection, proteins prM (presursor of M) and E are incorporated into immature virions, which bud into the endoplasmic reticulum.

A central, -sandwich domain (domain I) organizes its folded structure (Fig. 9B ) (Modis et al., 2003; Rey et al., 1995) . Two long and elaborate loops, stabilized by disulfide bridges, emanate from this central domain, forming a distinct subdomain termed domain II. At the tip of domain II is a hydrophobic sequence, identified from its conservation among all flaviviruses as the fusion loop (Allison et al., 2001) . A third domain (domain III) follows the others in the polypeptidechain sequence; it has an immunoglobulin-like fold, and various lines of evidence indicate that it binds receptors (at least in the case of several, well-studied flaviviruses). Between domain III and the transmembrane anchor are about 50 amino acid residues-a segment that has been called the \"stem\" (Allison et al., 1999) . Although not a part of the protein that crystallizes, its conformation on the virion has been deduced from cryo-EM image reconstructions. It is a pair of helices with an intervening loop, sandwiched between the main part of the E protein and the outer surface of the lipid bilayer (W. . The transmembrane anchor is also a helical hairpin, as the virus relies on signal protease (in the endoplasmic reticulum [ER] lumen) to cleave E from a precursor polyprotein.",

The rearranged, presumably postfusion, structure of sE has been determined [for dengue virus type 2 (Modis et al., 2004) and for TBE virus ] by taking advantage of the observation that sE dissociates reversibly to monomers in solution at low pH, but trimerizes irreversibly if liposomes are present (Stiasny et al., 2002) . The conformational change involves reorientations of the three domains with respect to each other and probably an extension of the stem (not present in the sE trimer that crystallizes; Fig. 9C ). The clustered domains II present their fusion loops at one end of the trimer. The loops themselves have essentially the same conformation as they do in the prefusion dimer, and the extent of their joint hydrophobic surface leads to the conclusion that they probably interact only with the outer leaflet of the target membrane bilayer and that they can dip by no more than 5 to 10-\u00c5 into its hydrophobic region. The reorientation of domain II with respect to domain I is a rotation of about 20 . The reorientation of domain III is substantially greater; it flips over in such a way that its C terminus now projects back toward the fusion loops. The structure leads directly to the proposal that in the fusion rearrangement of intact E, the three stems extend along the lateral faces of the clustered domains II, forcing the C-terminal transmembrane segments to approach the fusion loops. This feature of the conformational transition accomplishes essentially the same result as the fold-back of class I viral fusion proteins: it brings together the two membrane-associated parts of the protein and thus can cause the target cell membrane, into which the fusion loops are presumably inserted, to approach the viral membrane, into which the transmembrane anchor penetrates (Fig. 10) .",

One follows from the analogy with class I viral fusion and the approach embodied in the development of T-20/enfuvirtide: use of a peptide containing sequences derived from the stem. Provided that the stem interacts as strongly with the threefold clustered domains II as the outer layer helices of gp41 interact with the trimeric core, then stem-derived peptides would be expected to frustrate the zippingup step (Fig. 10D) , just as T-20 or C34 frustrate the zipping up of gp41. A second strategy follows from the observation that a detergent molecule can occupy the hydrophobic pocket at the domain I-domain II interface (Modis et al., 2003) . This pocket disappears during the fusion rearrangement, so small molecules that lodge there would probably retard refolding.",

The lipid requirements are the same as those for fusion of intact virions: the target membrane must contain cholesterol and sphingolipid. Electron microscopy of liposomes with inserted E1 or E1* gives similar pictures: arrays of uniform trimers (Gibbons et al., 2003) . Thus, the presence of the C-terminal transmembrane anchor does not affect the way the fusion loops insert into the membrane. In the absence of a liposome bilayer into which to insert, E1* remains monomeric at lowered pH, like flavivirus sE. In both cases, the bilayer catalyzes the trimeric association, presumably by concentrating the monomers and organizing them in essentially parallel orientations.

Several of these mutations change the size of hydrophobic side chains, suggesting that their effect is on the free energy cost of altering the domain I-domain II hinge position, rather than on the pK of a titrating residue. Candidates for proton-binding residues are two conserved histidines at the domain I-domain III interface in the prefusion dimer . One might expect protonation of these histidines to destabilize that interface, inducing dissociation of the dimer as domain III swings away both from its own domain I and from the fusion loop region of the other subunit.",

Even three clustered fusion loops, as in the DEN-2 sE trimer, do not seem to bind a detergent micelle (Modis et al., 2004) . Nonetheless, they clearly insert stably into bilayers, as seen directly by electron microscopy for SFV E1 ectodomain, DEN-2 sE, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) sE (Gibbons et al., 2003; Modis et al., 2004; Stiasny et al., 2004) .

The stem segments are likely to be quite flexible, and the description we gave of class I folding back as first a melting out (of the C-terminal part of HA 2 ) and then a zipping up probably applies to class II proteins as well. In this case, the melted-out part would be the stem.

Insertion of the fusion loops only into the outer bilayer leaflet will indeed produce some degree of positive curvature in the target membrane. A simple area calculation suggests, however, that it would take a relatively large number of trimers-more than are likely to contribute to one fusion event-to produce the degree of curvature pictured in some theoretical models of hemifusion (see, e.g., Kuzmin et al., 2001) . A more important consequence of the limited insertion may be the possibility for the fusion loops to migrate into the hemifusion stalk itself, thereby stabilizing the stalk and preventing its reveral (fission). This notion is attractive for two reasons. First, it depends on a general property of the fusion segment (limited insertion), and it could apply to class I fusion mechanisms as well. Second, it explains the observation of stable hemifusion (so far, for class I fusion only) when proceeding to full fusion is substantially retarded. This proposed incorporation of fusion loops into the hemifusion stalk is included in the the diagram in Fig. 10 .",

Lateral contacts between the outer rims of fusion loops from adjacent trimers in the crystals of the low pH-induced form of SFV E1* suggest that these interactions may create a ring of five trimers, angled at roughly 45 to the viral membrane, with their fusion loops (15 in all) forming a hydrophobic \"crater\" at the tip of a fusion \"volcano\" Gibbons et al., 2004b) . These 15 loops might indeed be sufficient to stabilize a nipplelike outpouching of the target cell membrane, a first step toward formation of a hemifusion stalk, and their coordinated participation could promote rapid transit through the hemifusion stage to an open fusion pore, as observed (Samsonov et al., 2002) .",

The prefusion intermediate (Figs. 3B, 10C) presumably flickers toward the zipped-up conformation but proceeds along that direction only when it meets a low enough barrier. If squeezing the two membranes together requires more than one trimer-that is, if the resistance of the membranes to deformation counteracts the tendency of a single extended intermediate to collapse by zipping up into the folded-back structure-then only when several trimers proceed toward the zipped-up conformation in concert will the refolding proceed. In this view, cooperativity is achieved not by defined proteinprotein interactions (ring formation), but rather by coupling through the elastic properties of the membranes undergoing fusion. A hemifusion stalk might be generated by as few as one or two trimers or by as many as can fit around the stalk (probably five or six), depending on circumstances, concentrations, and of course the actual free energy recovery from a single trimer. One advantage of this picture is that it does not require additional protein-protein contacts between necessarily flickering and partly disordered intermediate structures.",
