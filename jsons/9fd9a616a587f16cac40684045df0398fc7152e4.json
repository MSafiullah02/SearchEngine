Although they signal through distinct receptors, type I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III IFNs elicit remarkably similar responses in cells. However, in vivo, type III and type I IFN responses are not fully redundant as their respective contribution to the antiviral defense highly depends on virus species. IFN-\u03bb is much more potent than IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 at controlling rotavirus infection. In contrast, clearance of several other viruses, such as influenza virus, mostly depends on IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. The IFN-\u03bb receptor was reported to be preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. Cells responsible for IFN-\u03bb production are still poorly characterized but seem to overlap only partly IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-producing cells. Accumulating data suggest that epithelial cells are also important IFN-\u03bb producers. Thus, IFN-\u03bb may primarily act as a protection of mucosal entities, such as the lung, skin or digestive tract. Type I and type III IFN signal transduction pathways largely overlap, and cross talk between these IFN systems occurs. Finally, this review addresses the potential benefit of IFN-\u03bb use for therapeutic purposes and summarizes recent results of genome-wide association studies that identified polymorphisms in the region of the IFN-\u03bb3 gene impacting on the outcome of treatments against hepatitis C virus infection.",

IFN-\u03bb forms the type III IFN family, which is composed of three members, IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3, also named IL-29, IL-28A and IL-28B, respectively [1, 2] . Recently, a fourth IFN-\u03bb subtype, named IFN-\u03bb4, has been described in humans [3] . It is expressed in a small fraction of the human population as a consequence of a frameshift occurring in a coding sequence, upstream of the IFNL3 gene. This IFN only bears 29% identity with IFN-\u03bb3 but acts through the same receptor and displays typical antiviral activity [4] .",

Type I IFNs use a different receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c. However, upon binding their cognate receptors, type I and type III IFNs trigger the same Jak-STAT signal transduction pathway [5, 8, 9] ( fig. 1 ), leading to the upregulation of many genes, called IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [reviewed in 10 ] . More than 300 ISGs have been identified. Their products act to control viral infection, to modulate immune responses or to control mitosis. In addition, some ISGs encode factors that participate in the IFN signal transduction pathway and, therefore, control IFN expression and response through positive or negative feedback loops ( fig. 1 ).",

Additional studies showed no protective effect of IFN-\u03bb against infection with encephalomyocarditis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus [8, 12] . Similarly, no antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb could be detected in mice against hepatotropic viruses such as Rift Valley fever virus, Lassa fever virus or a mutant strain of Thogoto virus (THOV) lacking the IFN-antagonist ML protein (\u0394ML) [14, 15] . The lack of IFN-\u03bb antiviral activity against these viruses was not due to a lack of IFN-\u03bb expression in infected organs since IFN-\u03bb was transcriptionally active in the liver of mice infected with THOV-\u0394ML [14] .

For these viruses, mice lacking both receptors turned out to be significantly more susceptible than IFNLR1 0/0 mice [14] [15] [16] . Additional studies carried out with influenza virus showed variable extents of protection mediated by IFN-\u03bb: two studies reported that IFN-\u03bb was of moderate importance against influenza virus (strains SC35M, PR8-\u0394NS1, A/HH/05/2009 and B/Lee/ 40) [14, 15] and one study observed a major role for IFN-\u03bb (strain A/HK-X31) [16] . Such differences in influenza virus control might relate to variations in the ability of the different virus strains to spread systemically from the respiratory epithelium [16] .",

IL-28R\u03b1 0/0 , and double-knockout mice were highly susceptible to oral rotavirus infection, while IFNAR 0/0 and wild-type mice were resistant.

            "text": "The receptor chain that is specific for IFN-\u03bb was first identified in humans [1, 2, 7] . It has been discovered simultaneously by three different teams and called IL-28R\u03b1 [2] , LICR2 [7] or CRF2-12 [1] . It is now most commonly referred to as IFNLR1. By associating with the \u03b2 chain of the IL-10 receptor (IL10RB), it forms the heterodimeric receptor necessary for IFN-\u03bb signaling. The murine receptor has also been characterized [5] . Mouse IFNLR1 shares about 67% similarity with the human receptor and is encoded by a gene present on mouse chromosome 4D3. Interestingly, unlike type I IFNs, mouse and human IFN-\u03bb are not species specific and can bind the receptors of both species [5] . Expression of IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3, like that of IFN-\u03b1, depends more on IRF7 availability. Type I IFNs use a dimeric receptor composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c. Type III IFNs signal through a different receptor, which is composed of IFNLR1 and IL10RB. Upon binding to their cognate receptors, type I and type III IFNs induce the same Jak/STAT pathway: the transphosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated Jak1 and Tyk2 leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors. Phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT2 further associate with IRF9 to form a heterotrimeric ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. ISGF3 then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to sequences of IFN-stimulated response elements present in the promoter of ISGs to upregulate their transcription. Some ISG products participate themselves in the signaling pathways leading to IFN production and IFN responses thus creating positive (and negative) feedback loops. Given the similarity of type I and type III IFN pathways, IFN-\u03bb is expected to influence both the production of and response to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, and vice versa. cGAS = Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase.",

Unsurprisingly, IFN-\u03bb responses correlated with IL-28R\u03b1 expression [11] . Fibroblasts, splenocytes, bone-marrowderived macrophages and endothelial cells did not re- spond to IFN-\u03bb, although they responded to IFN-\u03b1. In contrast, mouse melanoma cells and keratinocytes responded to IFN-\u03bb [5] . Further studies demonstrated that epithelial cells are the primary targets of type III IFNs. Analysis of IFNLR1 expression in isolated mouse cells revealed that keratinocytes and vaginal epithelial cells, but not fibroblasts, were responsive to IFN-\u03bb [12] . The first in vivo study of IFNLR1 expression in mice was performed in our laboratory [19] . In this study, the response to circulating IFN-\u03bb was evaluated in vivo in various mouse organs after plasmid-mediated expression of IFN-\u03bb from tibialis muscle cells. The tissues that showed the highest IFN-\u03bb responsiveness -stomach, intestine, skin and lung -were epithelium-rich organs. Moreover, the response to IFN-\u03bb paralleled IFNLR1 expression in analyzed tissues. In this study, the IFN-\u03bb response was analyzed at the cellular level in kidney and brain sections using immunohistofluorescent detection of Mx1, a specific marker of the IFN response. IFN-\u03bb-responsive cells strikingly differed from IFN-\u03b1-responsive cells. After IFN-\u03bb expression, Mx1-positive cells almost exclusively corresponded to epithelial cells. These included cells forming the convoluted tubules in the kidney and the epithelial cells of the choro\u00efd plexus in the brain. In contrast to IFN-\u03bb, circulating IFN-\u03b1 induced a widespread response, which was pronounced in endothelial cells and included most cell types. The epithelial cell specificity of IFN-\u03bb responses was subsequently observed in many other organs, such as the lung, intestine, stomach, skin or liver [15, 17, 19, 20] ( fig. 3 ). In humans, constitutive expression of IFNLR1 was also observed in the upper epidermis [21] .",

These receptors include the transmembrane Tolllike receptors (TLRs), cytoplasmic RNA helicases, such as RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, and cytoplasmic DNA sensors, such as the recently identified cyclic GMP-AMP synthase [31] . Pattern recognition receptors recognize byproducts of virus replication and trigger the synthesis of IFN. It was reported that type I and type III IFNs were induced by very similar signaling pathways [1, 2, 32, 33] ( fig. 1 ). Indeed, IFN-\u03bb1 gene expression largely depends on IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, as that of IFN-\u03b2. IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 gene expression rather depends on IRF7, thus resembling that of IFN-\u03b1 [33] ( fig. 1 ). Yet, the range of IFN-\u03bb-producing cells may not fully overlap that of type I IFN-producing cells. It was shown in vivo that the balance between type I and type III IFN gene transcription differed in the liver and the brain of infected mice [19] .",

Likewise, IFN-\u03bb treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or pDCs in coculture with HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells enhanced the production of IFN-\u03b1 [23] . In contrast, two studies failed to show activation of the type I IFN pathway by IFN-\u03bb: after infection with Sendai virus, splenocytes derived from IFN-LR1 0/0 mice did not produce less type I or type III IFN than splenocytes derived from wild-type mice [12] ; also, IFN-\u03bb treatment of human airway epithelial cells infected with influenza A did not increase IFN-\u03b2 expression [34] .

[56] identified two additional SNPs in the IFNL3 gene (SNPs rs28416813 and rs8103142) that are highly associated with rs12979860. rs28416813 consists of a G \u2192 C substitution 37 bp upstream of the IFNL3 start codon, and rs8103142, which occurs in the IFN-\u03bb open reading frame and results in a nonsynonymous amino acid change at position 70, where arginine is substituted for lysine (K70R). Since then, other SNPs have been identified in the region of the IFNL3 gene and associated with sustained virological response to pegIFN-\u03b1/ribavirin therapy. However, the mechanism by which IFN-\u03bb3 polymorphisms affect the efficacy of HCV clearance remains to be determined. Recently, a novel transcript located 3 kb upstream of IFNL3 was identified as IFNL4 [3] . The SNP rs12979860 is located within intron 1 of this newly identified gene, and a novel marker, ss469415590, was detected in exon 1. ss469415590 is a dinucleotide variant (TT \u2192 \u0394G) where \u0394G results from the deletion of one T nucleotide (rs67272382) and from a T \u2192 G substitution (rs74597329) [3] . The \u0394G variant creates a frameshift that allows the expression of the IFN-\u03bb4 protein. Paradoxically, the expression of this additional IFN-\u03bb subtype is associated with impaired clearance of HCV, although IFN-\u03bb4 was shown to exhibit a potent inhibitory effect against HCV replication in vitro [3, 4] . Moreover, IFN-\u03bb4 expression is often correlated with the expression of the rs12979860[T] allele, which is also a predictor of a low virological response to HCV treatment [3] .",

IFN-\u03bb can induce a longer STAT1 activation and repeated stimulation of cells with IFN-\u03bb does not lead to refractoriness of the cells to subsequent stimulation [52] . Importantly, in vivo, the expression pattern of the IFN-\u03bb receptor clearly diverges from that of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor. The IFN-\u03bb response is predominantly observed in epithelial cells, although some hematopoietic cells were also shown to be responsive. IFN-\u03bb thus likely evolved to protect mucosal surfaces against viral infection. This IFN family is probably of utter importance against viruses with a strong epithelial tropism, as was demonstrated in the case of rotavirus [17] . It is worth noting that recent studies show that epithelial cells also act as IFN-\u03bb-producing cells. The IFN-\u03bb system thus likely evolved to offer a local protection that fits epithelium-rich anatomical structures, such as the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract ( fig. 4 ) . Protection of epithelial surfaces may also be instrumental in limiting virus transmission by feco-oral or aerosol transmission by reducing both virus excretion and virus entry.",

Yet, some studies suggest that cells producing type I and type III IFNs do not fully overlap and more studies are required to address this issue. Recently, an elegant model of a reporter mouse was developed to identify IFN-\u03b2-producing cells. In these mice, one allele of the IFN-\u03b2-coding region was replaced by the firefly luciferase-coding region, allowing immunostaining and in vivo imaging of IFN-\u03b2-producing cells [61] . The development of such a model to monitor IFN-\u03bb expression in vivo would be particularly valuable to complete the understanding of the peculiarities of the IFN-\u03bb system.",
