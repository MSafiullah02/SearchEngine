On the basis of size and shape 7 distinct viral types were detected: 24 nm parvovirus-like particles, 30 nm astrovirus, 30 nm picornavirus-like particles, reovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus and a 75 nm \"togavirus-like\" particle. The incidence of these particles in the 208 cats was 11%, 7%, 6%, 0.4%, 5%, 1 Yo and 1 O h respectively. Virus isolation studies using 40 of the faecal samples succeeded in isolating reovirus 1 in 2 cases. Immune electron microscope studies demonstrated the presence of antibody in a human serum to cat astrovirus, but failed to clarify the identity of the parvovirus-like particles and picornavirus-like particles, other than showing that some of the patvovirus-like particles were not related to feline panleukopenia virus. It was found that parvovirus-like particles, astrovirus, picomavirus-like particles, reovirus and rotavirus could be excreted by cats with normal faeces as well as cats with diarrhoeal faeces.",

So far, 7 main groups of virus or virus-like particles have been associated with the cat intestinal tract or cat faeces. These include parvovirus (Johnson 1965; Langheinrich and Nielsen 1971; Studdert and Peterson 1973; Siegl 1984) , astrovirus (Hoshino et a1 1981b) , calicivirus (Wardley 1976; Studdert 1978) , reovirus (Scott 1971) , rotavirus (Chrystie et a1 1979; Hoshino et a1 1981a) , coronavirus (Pedersen et a1 1981) and coronavirus-like particles (CVLP) (Hoshino and Scott 1980; Stoddart et al 1984) . In many cases, information on these particles in cats is scant and there appears to have been no major survey of viruses in cat faeces. In this study the nature and frequency of excretion of virus and virus-like particles in a large sample of diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal cats were examined, and the significance of the findings to cat and human health briefly reviewed.",

In Western Australia it is commonly known as branched onion weed (Figures 1, 2) and it has become well established and widely distributed on the Calcareous tuart and beach sands of the south western coastal belt (MacFarlane 1986). Disease in grazing livestock in South Africa has recently been attributed to this plant (Newsholme et a1 1985) and to a related species, T. lava (Grant et al 1985) . The disease is characterised clinically by a severe paretic syndrome, and pathologically by intense lipofuscin storage in neurons in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral ganglia, and to a lesser extent, in the Kupffer cells of the liver, renal tubular cells and macrophages in the spleen, lung and intestinal mucosa. In this paper we report the occurrence of a similar clinical and pathological entity in sheep and horses exposed to T. divaricata in south western Australia. It is suggested that the evidence is sufficient for T. divaricata to be recognised as a hazard to grazing livestock School of Veterinary Studies, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Western Australia 61 50 t Regional Laboratory, West Australia Department of Agriculture, Bunbury, Western Australia 6230 $ 52 Uduc Road, Harvey, Western Australia 6220 Q 72 First Avenue, Rossmoyne.
