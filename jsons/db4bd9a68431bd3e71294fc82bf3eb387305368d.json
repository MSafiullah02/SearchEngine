This model is intended to use only the observed daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the contamination and to give a prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the contaminated individuals.

In this way the specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered for different countries.",

The objects may be of different types and physical nature. From nuclear reaction and cosmic rays to cell proliferation and digital information, branching stochastic models are used to explain very interesting real-world stochastic phenomena. Branching processes have serious applications in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Medicine, Demography, Epidemiology, Economics an so on. The basic models and analytical results are presented in many books and a lot of papers. We would like to point out the monographs [1 \u2212 5] among the others. Some applications of branching processes in Biology and Medicine are presented in [4] and [6] . Some basic estimation problems are considered in [7] .",

For this purpose a special branching process with two types of contaminated individuals is constructed and considered day by day. In this way we are able to use the observed statistics of the Covid-19 daily registered contaminated individuals and to estimate the main parameter of contamination. In fact this parameter m represents the mean value of the contaminated individuals by one individual per day. Using the observed statistics some methods for estimation are proposed and the corresponding graphics are presented. In this way we are able to give a prediction of the possible development of the mean value of the contaminated individuals. The modeling and estimation is performed for Bulgaria and some other countries: Italy, France, Germany, Spain globally. Of course, the model can be applied to any other country or region. In the paper the results are presented in detail for Bulgaria, Italy and globally.
