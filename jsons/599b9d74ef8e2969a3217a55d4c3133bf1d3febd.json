ECT requires general anaesthesia which involves close contact with patient oral and airway secretions and actively encouraging the patient to cough in the recovery room after ECT. Each patient contact with the team can last for several hours in a small, confined environment with recirculated air and repeated 10 to 20 times over a period of weeks to months. Patients from a wide geographical region 16 and are often kept in close contact in small rooms for several hours before and after ECT. Patients receiving ECT tend to be older 14 and have a high chance of having comorbid medical conditions like hypertension or diabetes 17 all of which increases their mortality if infected with COVID-19 7 . Further, patients receiving ECT often have poorer hygiene 18 , live in crowded wards or housing 19 and are hence less able to observe the which increases the risk of both ECT staff being infected by a large pool of high risk patients and infected ECT staff infecting other units when they rotate out of their ECT duties.",

A decision was made to restrict the pool of staff down to just 2 ECT practitioners, 2 anaesthetists and 11 nursing staff and reduce the number of staff required at any time to 11 (down from 12). We were able to reduce the number of staff required by enlisting the ward and outpatient staff to assist with ECT patient transportation. One of the ECT nursing staff would have a new role of receiving ECT patients and conducting COVID-19 risk screening and temperature taking before letting the patient into the ECT room. This nursing staff also ensured that a maximum of 1 visitor equipped with a face mask could accompany the patient. This was on top of IMH measures of restricting all access to a single entrance operated 24/7 by a dedicated screening team using the current suspect COVID-19 case definition and temperature screening. These changes required a concerted effort from nursing and human resources to adjust contracts and staff allocation. We were also fortunate to have recently trained an advance practice nurse (APN) to be an ECT practitioner 37 which allowed for a backup ECT practitioner as 8 of the original 10 ECT practitioners were Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We started communicating with referring psychiatrists about the decreased ECT treatment capacity which would necessitate a decrease of ECT frequency from thrice a week to twice a week for most cases and had individual case discussions with clinicians about decreasing the frequency of outpatient maintenance ECT.

The DOTF consisted of all senior management (CEO, Chairman Medical Board, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Nurse, Heads of Departments for all services, corporate communications, finance and human resources). The DOTF also had executive branches for coordination, infection control and audit and contact tracing. The standing daily agenda was a review of global and local updates on COVID-19, updates on suspected case definition, PPE stock review and daily indicator updates. It had 3 guiding principles (1) Protect our staff from infection (2) Protect our patients from infection (3) Continue to support critical national psychiatric treatment needs. The DOTF met almost daily and promulgated regular updates to all staff on the national COVID-19 situation and IMH COVID-19 actions via internal email, Facebook Workplace apps and Townhall sessions. Besides adhering to all national COVID-19 guidelines, IMH further identified core psychiatric services that were tasked to develop specific BCPs to continue operations in DORSCON Orange and Red. As there is no specific treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, we adopted a hierarchy of controls approach to protecting staff and patients: Engineering, Administrative and PPE 25 . The most effective level of control (Engineering) refers to the placement of barriers between COVID-19 and healthcare staff (e.g. batching patients by location). Administrative controls refer to policies to reduce exposure to COVID-19 (e.g. travel restrictions for healthcare staff) and PPE being the final level of control for frontline healthcare staff.",

There was an initial thought of having 1 patient in the ECT room at any one time and decontaminating theentire room between patients. While this would minimize cross infection risk, it would have reduced capacity by about 70-80% as each patient required at least 30 minutes of post-ECT continuous monitoring, rendering this option unfeasible. Consistent with the principle of a calibrated approach to COVID-19 infection control measures 38 and low rates of COVID-19 community spread, we decided on a balanced approach of batching patients by physical location (inpatients by ward, outpatients separately from inpatients) to minimize the chance of infection while only losing 30-40% capacity. This required a full review of all locations patients came from and calculating the load from each location to optimize scheduling. The intent was to minimize mixing of patients from different locations and decrease the chance of infection. With the new strategy of listing patients by location, a new operations board was set up as a visual management aid for staff. It gave staff a comprehensive view of patients\" locations and let us realize that some wards had as few as 1 patient receiving ECT and others as many as 10. (See Image 1 below)",
