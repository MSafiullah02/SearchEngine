Drawing from theories of health perception and cognitive load, we develop and test a research model hypothesizing why people share unverified COVID-19 information through social media. Our findings suggest a person's trust in online information and perceived information overload are strong predictors of unverified information sharing. Furthermore, these factors, along with a person's perceived COVID-19 severity and vulnerability influence cyberchondria. Females were significantly more likely to suffer from cyberchondria, however, males were more likely to share news without fact checking their source. Our findings suggest that to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 misinformation and cyberchondria, measures should be taken to enhance a healthy skepticism of health news while simultaneously guarding against information overload.",

A variety of reasons for have been offered to explain the increased misinformation dissemination, including a decline in social capital, economic inequality, stratification of people into social sub-groups, a distorted and shattered media landscape, and a decline in public trust towards science (Lewandowsky et al., 2017) . Typically, the public use of social media is attributed for the rise misinformation (Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017) , while websites and traditional news coverage can also contribute to the problem. Fake news is a similar to misinformation, which is defined to be a mimicry of media outlets that lacks the editorial process, norms and journalistic rigor that ensures a trustworthy quality of news reporting (Lazer et al., 2018) . The reported increase in misinformation and fake news ultimately led to the term \"post-truth\" skyrocket in use during 2015-2016 in so that it was selected the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year in 2016 (Levitin, 2017) .",

The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of such an event. The pandemic emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread globally (Chinazzi, et al., 2020) which led to the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020. As a response to the pandemic, countries issued travel restrictions, closed schools, universities and public services and placed people in quarantine to mitigate the spread of the disease (Fang et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith and Freedman, 2020) . While these actions took place, individuals were informed about the pandemic and what individual measures could and should be taken to combat the spread of COVID-19. Social media was filled with sharing COVID-19 related news and articles, some of which were found to be misinformation (Cinelli et al., 2020) . The abundance of available information and its ambiguity combined with the novelty of the pandemic situation increased the risk of health anxiety (Doherty-Torstrick et al., 2016; Mathes et al., 2018; White and Horvitz, 2009 ). Thus, our study incorporates the concept of cyberchondria, which encapsulates the unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptomology based on review of online content. Indeed, cyberchondria may well be the most pressing health issue arising from the abundance of health-related fake news.",

Therefore, from a health perception and information load perspective, the aim of this study is to empirically determine the specific individual drivers of COVID-19 social media misinformation sharing and cyberchondria. Previous studies on why people share fake news or misinformation on social media have found several explanators, of which high trust in online sources is pertinent (Talwar et al., 2019; Khan and Idris, 2019) . However, studies about misinformation sharing during a major health-crisis such as COVID-19 are missing. People make different decisions about information when driven by fear and anxiety (Allen et al. 2014) . As an example, there is evidence that information-seeking during pandemics is more common in those experiencing worry or fear (Lin et al. 2014) . Similarly, previous research suggests that when in a state of fear or distress, peoples' usage patterns and perceptions of social media alters significantly to the extent they can become overloaded and fatigued (Maier et al., 2014; Whelan et al., 2020b) . Building on this existing work, we investigate the drivers of COVID-19 specific misinformation and cyberchondria.",

We test the model with survey data from 294 Facebook users from Bangladesh using the PLS-SEM analysis technique. The results revealed both information factors are associated with increased cyberchondria and sharing unverified information. The health factors had no impact on sharing unverified information, but did predict increased cyberchondria. Finally, we found no direct relationship between suffering from cyberchondria and sharing unverified information.",

The resulting visualization (see Figure 1 ) shows the literature on misinformation and social media to be grouped into three broad themes. One stream (top left) broadly focuses on applying computer science approaches to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. A second stream (bottom left) considers the impact of social media misinformation on politics, science, and society in general. The third stream (right) focuses on the relationship between misinformation and population health. It is largely the latter stream from which this study draws from and contributes to. While misinformation and fake news can exist anywhere and be mediated through the same channels as any other news, social media in particular has been found to accelerate the spread of fake news (Alcott and Gentzkow, 2016; Shu et al., 2017) . Besides sharing news, social media is valuable for people as a way to stay in touch with others (Sponcil and Gitimu, 2013) , however, it is also characterized by the desire for self-promotion (M\u00e4ntym\u00e4ki and Islam, 2016) . Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have been blamed for causing polarization with personalized news feeds, but in fact, recent studies have found that human's own choices limit the type of clicked content more than algorithms (Bakashy et al., 2015; Sphor, 2017) .",

Another mechanism relates to people themselves, who can be driven by wishes to either inform or hurt others (Chadwick and Vaccari, 2019) . Interestingly, medical professionals themselves were more likely to spread dread rumors than wish ones (Chua and Banerjee 2018) . Reports also suggest that some groups of people believe and spread false news, despite better evidence due to ideological reasons (Wolfe, 2002) . Studies have argued that the polarizing impact of social media contributes to the spread of fake news via confirmation biases and social influence (Sphor, 2017) .",

Also lack of experience about online environments and resulting trust in online information, as well as laziness in verifying the information source and lack of skills to do it, are reasons contributing to people sharing misinformation (Khan and Idris, 2019; Talwar et al., 2019) . It is almost impossible to accurately determine whether a piece of news is misinformation or based on evidence simply based on the news article itself (Del Vicario et al., 2016) , and therefore, additional sources for verifying the news' reliability are needed. Recent studies have demonstrated that by directing readers to pay attention to the news source and its reliability negatively impacts sharing misinformation onwards (Kim and Dennis, 2019) .",

Indeed, the lock-down enacted in many countries with workplaces and social activities required to close, may have the unintended consequence of escalating misinformation and cyberchondria as people have more time at their disposal to overload on social media content.",

Another theory, which is often used in a similar way as HBM to understand health behavior, is the PMT (Prentice-Dunn and Rogers, 1986). The PMT focuses on understanding the reasons why humans adapt protective health measures, which in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic are, for example, washing hands and self-isolation. However, just like the HBM, the PMT has also been used elsewhere, such as, for understanding why people adopt protective cybersecurity measures (Meso et al., 2013) . A review study on PMT identified perceived threat to be the main driver behind protection motivation (Bish and Michie, 2010) . For the current study, we employ the concepts of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity to conceptualize perceived threats (i.e. health beliefs) because of their relevance in both HBM and PMT, and because previous studies found these constructs to be the significant predictors for health motivation (Bish and Michie, 2010) . Perceived severity is defined as the individual's appraisal of the severity of the situation with regards to health consequences (Ling et al., 2019) whereas perceived susceptibility is an appraisal of the probability of being vulnerable in the given situation (Ling et al., 2019) .",

This contributed to an increased spread of misinformation. The finding can be understood through the CLT, which postulates that humans have limited working memory. In novel situations where new information is being presented at high volumes, the human cognitive capacity gets overloaded, which may lead to social media fatigue (Maier et al., 2014; Whelan et al. 2020b ) and trigger the evolutionary instinct to retreat to a safer ground, away from the difficult-to-conceptualize information (Sweller, 2011) . Once humans are fatigued, it reduces their ability to make sense of the new situation, and hinders their judgement and decision making, for example, with regards to what news is backed up by journalistic rigor and what is not. This implies that when humans are overloaded with information, they are less likely to go through the extra trouble of verifying information sources (Whelan et al., 2020b) .

Second, the situation developed fast, forcing humans to adapt to the new knowledge quickly. Third, through social media, individuals across the globe shared their experiences, with lots of news appearing all the time, some real, some fake. The quantity of information further made it difficult to understand the actual state of the situation. Fourth and finally, as the knowledge was being generated and shared rapidly, not all of it could be clearly structured and presented in an optimal and understandable way. The resulting lack of clarity further contributed to cognitive overload. Previous studies of cyberchondria suggest it is associated with information overload (White and Horvitz, 2009 ) and uncertainty (Norr et al., 2015) . Likewise, one' anxiety about their health interacts with the amount of information they seek online to shape health related decisions (Eastin and Gunisler, 2006) .

For example, medical professionals are more likely to spread rumors online when the perceived relevance of the rumor to them is high (Chua and Banjeree 2018) . When investigating social media use after the Boston Marathon Bombings, Huang et al., (2015) found emotional and physical proximity to increase the likelihood of sharing unverified information.

Cyberchondria differs from health anxiety in that it impairs functionality, but the two are otherwise linked with measurable symptoms (Mathes et al., 2018) . Since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, most news feeds globally were filled with information about it. The swarm of information released about COVID-19 communicated the severity of the situation, with individuals appraising this information by evaluating the threat as well as their ability to cope with it (Rogers and Prentice-Dunn, 1997). As postulated by the PMT, a natural consequence of a severe threat appraisal is to search for more information on the matter in order to cope with the situation. In practice, this would mean going online to search for more information on COVID-19. The new information could then further accelerate the threat appraisal via the mechanisms already hypothesized earlier. Thus, we propose our two hypotheses.",

Accordingly, this work opens up a new unexplored research area and combines theories from both health behavior literature and instructional science to understand the studied relationships.

Our study offers perspectives into how information overload during novel and unprecedented situations might accelerate the propagation of fake news due to the human factor. Our paper initiates new discussions on identifying, but also controlling the underlying factors that contribute to the spread of fake news during global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We found that online information trust and information overload are the two main antecedents of sharing unverified information on social media. Talwar et al. (2019) found online trust as the most important antecedent of fake news sharing. Khan and Idris (2019) also reported possible association between higher levels of trust and unverified information sharing. We confirm the findings of these prior literature in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, we extend the prior literature (Talwar et al., 2019; Khan and Idris, 2019) by showing information overload as another main antecedent of sharing unverified information on social media. Huang et al. (2015) in their interview-based research concluded that information overload was related to fake news sharing during Boston bombings. Our study verifies this finding using a quantitative approach in the context of COVID-19. We also identified four factors, namely online information trust, information overload, perceived severity and perceived susceptibility that had a positive correlation with cyberchondria",

            "text": "Based on our findings, intervention strategies such as nudging people to consider the source of social media content, and to consume manageable amounts of that content, are likely to be effective in reducing the spread of misinformation and cyberchondria in crisis situations. While nudging interventions have been found to be effective when dealing with artificially created and benign misinformation (e.g. celebrity gossip), their efficacy when applied to real and personally involved crises have yet to be empirically tested (Kim and Dennis, 2019) .. Additionally, due to COVID-19, many people are out of work or unable to partake in social activities, and thus have more time to consume social media content. Information overload may well be an unintended consequence of the COVID-19 crisis which exacerbates the problems of misinformation and cyberchondria. Health organizations can use our findings to educate social media users to consume content in a sustainable manner and thus avoid these problems. Likewise, social media companies have a significant role to play in curbing COVID-19 misinformation. WhatsApp have already introduced restrictions on the forwarding of messages. Our findings suggest that if social media companies restricted the amount of COVID-19 specific information people are exposed to, this would be effective in curbing misinformation and cyberchondria problems.",

            "text": "As a cross-sectional survey, our results did not account for any change that might have occurred in the observed behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Answers to the survey were collected from university educated persons in Bangladesh who were using social media. As such, the results might not be representative of the entirety of the Bangladeshi or world population. In fact, education level might be one important factor that can reduce the sharing of unverified information, as previous literature suggests increasing the population's education and digital literacy levels specifically, to be the answer to the post-truth era and abundance of fake news (Auberry, 2018; Chadwick and Vaccari, 2019; Ireland, 2018) . Lewandowsky et al. (2017) argue that research investigating misinformation or its impacts should be situated within a wide context, taking into account technological, political and societal factors. Looking at our study from this perspective, we measured the technological factors such as information overload, however, we did not account for political or societal factors. Thus, future research could expand on the current study by taking into account the political and societal dimensions. In practise, this could mean further investigation into the role, responsibility and ability of governments and platform developers to direct social media users towards trustworthy clear information, warding against information overload and consequently cyberchondria, as well as impulses to read and share fake news. On a societal level, future research agenda can include looking at the impact of cyberchondria on individual well-being during global pandemic crises such as the COVID-19, and designing measures for mitigating the negative impacts. Samson and Kostyszyn (2015) proposed that cognitive overload is one of the causes for the observed increase in mistrust, and that trust can be increased by reducing cognitive load. Cognitive load has also obvious effects on perceptions on information, including health information, and information overload (Sweller, 2011) . In the current work we did not measure the respondent's cognitive load during COVID-19 and reading online information, but future work could expand on the model by taking into account the impact of cognitive load on both the health and information factors. We find the CLT promising in explaining our findings and invite practitioners as well as scholar to investigate whether efforts to reduce cognitive load during pandemics can alleviate both the sharing of fake news and cyberchondria.",
