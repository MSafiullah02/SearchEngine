            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionary\u2010conserved homology\u2010dependent gene\u2010silencing mechanism, which governs posttranscriptional regulation of a myriad of cellular genes, heterochromatisation, and antiviral innate immunity (Bartel, 2018; Baulcombe, 2004; Hannon, 2002). It is the lattermost function, however, for which RNAi is postulated to have primarily evolved an intrinsic RNA surveillance system serving as a natural immune safeguard against invading nucleic acids of transposons and viral origin (van Rij & Andino, 2006). The working principle of RNAi essentially includes cleavage (dicing) of double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) of endogenous (during microRNA biogenesis) or exogenous (foreign nucleic acids) origin by cellular RNase III\u2010like endonuclease DICER into small RNA duplexes of approximately 21\u201323 nucleotides (mature microRNAs and short interfering RNAs). These RNA duplexes with characteristic terminal overhangs are further loaded on to a supramolecular RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC), where one strand of the duplex is stripped off (passenger strand), and the other strand (guide RNA) bearing complementarity to cognate mRNA sequence guides the silencer complex to its target. The ultimate fate of the target mRNA is determined by the degree of complementarity between the guide strand and the target sequence; perfect complementarity (for siRNAs) triggers cleavage (slicing) of the mRNA whereas imperfect complementarity (generally for miRNAs) sequesters mRNA away from polyribosomes into cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies) resulting in translational repression. At the catalytic core of RISC are the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins of which mammals encode four homologs (AGO1\u20134). In spite of evidences of functional redundancy among the four AGOs, slicer activity is exhibited only by the isoform AGO2 in mammalian cells (Bartel, 2009; Bartel, 2018; Siomi & Siomi, 2009).",

            "text": "During viral infection, replicative or transcriptive viral dsRNA intermediates may succumb to processing by host cellular RNAi yielding virus\u2010derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs), which might further direct viral RNA cleavage ultimately resulting in heavily attenuated viral replication. As a coevolutionary counterstrategy, viruses have adopted RNAi\u2010evasive virulence measures in the form of producing virus\u2010encoded\u2010suppressors\u2010of\u2010RNAi (Bivalkar\u2010Mehla et al., 2011; Burgy\u00e1n & Havelda, 2011; Ding, Han, Wang, & Li, 2018; Wu, Wang, & Ding, 2010). Experimental evidence of viRNA generation during the course of natural viral infection is abundant in plants, worms, and insects (Siu et al., 2011). Physiological relevance of RNAi as an antiviral innate immunity, however, has been greatly debated in differentiated, somatic cells of higher vertebrates because of the evolution of a superior, interferon (IFN)\u2010based innate immune system (Cullen & Cherry, 2013; Goubau, Deddouche, & e Sousa, 2013; Maillard et al., 2016; Samuel, 2001; Schneider, Chevillotte, & Rice, 2014; ten Oever, 2016). Alternatively, mammalian viruses, at least in some contexts, have been experimentally shown to exert strong RNAi evasive mechanisms by encoding highly potent VSRs (Li, Lu, Han, Fan, & Ding, 2013; Qiu et al., 2017), justifying near absence of viRNAs in mammalian cells during natural course of infection (Parameswaran et al., 2010). Mammalian VSRs characterised till date include ebola virus VP35 (Haasnoot et al., 2007), influenza A virus NS1 (Bucher, Hemmes, de Haan, Goldbach, & Prins, 2004), vaccinia virus E3L (Li et al., 2004), nodamura virus B2 (Johnson, Price, Eckerle, & Ball, 2004), hepatitis C virus core (Wang et al., 2006), HIV\u20101 Tat (Bennasser & Jeang, 2006; Bennasser, Le, Benkirane, & Jeang, 2005), coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N (Cui et al., 2015), and virus\u2010associated RNAI and RNAII of adenoviruses (Andersson et al., 2005; Lu & Cullen, 2004). VSRs are generally dsRNA\u2010binding proteins (excepting adenoviral VSR), which inhibit activity of either Dicer, AGO, or both. Interestingly, all VSRs identified from mammalian viruses possess IFN or protein kinase R antagonistic properties and are essential for replication and pathogenesis, suggesting that RNAi and other innate antiviral responses are interrelated.",

            "text": "The genome of rotavirus (RV), a diarrheagenic virus in infants and young animals, consists of 11 segmented double\u2010stranded RNAs, which are usually enclosed within viral double\u2010layered particles and, at proliferative stage of infection, within highly dynamic encagements called viroplasms. Single\u2010stranded viral mRNAs, produced within double\u2010layered particles, are either translated into six structural (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural (NSP1 to NSP6) proteins or used as templates for viral RNA replication (Desselberger, 2014; Estes & Greenberg, 2013). However, oozing of rotaviral dsRNA intermediates in unmasked cytosolic environment has been hypothesised based on RNase III\u2010sensitive and dsRNA\u2010positive scattered signals in infected host cell cytoplasm (Rojas, Arias, & L\u00f3pez, 2010; Zhu et al., 2017). Accidental exposure of viral genomic dsRNAs or even transcriptive dsRNA intermediates in the cytoplasm may potentially evoke RNAi\u2010based surveillance mechanism. Strikingly, previous reports emphasised retention of competent RNAi pathway in the context of RV infection enabling functionality of both small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; D\u00e9ctor, Romero, L\u00f3pez, & Arias, 2002; Arias et al., 2004; L\u00f3pez, Rojas, Ayala\u2010Bret\u00f3n, L\u00f3pez, & Arias, 2005; Chen et al., 2011). Indeed, successfully knocking down expression of viral and host proteins has been proven to be excellent loss\u2010of\u2010function studies to unravel complex host\u2013RV interaction networks (Dhillon & DurgaRao, 2018; Mukherjee, Patra, Bhowmick, & Chawla\u2010Sarkar, 2018; Oceguera, Peralta, Mart\u00ednez\u2010Delgado, Arias, & L\u00f3pez, 2018; Patra, Mukhopadhyay, Sarkar, Mukherjee, & Chawla\u2010Sarkar, 2019; Silva\u2010Ayala et al., 2013; Trujillo\u2010Alonso, Maruri\u2010Avidal, Arias, & Lopez, 2011; Yin et al., 2018). Moreover, RNAi\u2010based potential therapeutic approaches targeting RV genes have also been advocated (Arias et al., 2004). Notably, in most of these experiments, RNAi functionality was assessed at relatively late hours of infection (beyond 6\u2010hr postinfection).",

RNAi pathway was found to be inhibited during early hours (2\u20136 hr) of RV\u2010SA11 infection only to be restored to full functional competence beyond that early phase. Blocking of RNAi was confirmed in the form of ablated functioning of siRNA and shRNA but not miRNA. Interestingly, hindrance to RNAi during the early stage of RV\u2010SA11 infection coincided with the loss of protein level of AGO2. Further mechanistic studies revealed that RV\u2010NSP1 interacts with and degrades AGO2 in ubiquitin\u2013proteasome\u2010dependent way. Together, the data highlight a fascinating and unique modulation of RNAi pathway in response to RV infection.",

            "text": "To assess the sensitivity of ectopic GFP expression to synthetic siRNA during early and late hours of RV infection, GFP (pEGFP\u2010N1)\u2010transfected MA104 cells were cotransfected with either siGFP or scrambled siRNA, and 36\u2010hr posttransfection cells were further mock\u2010infected or infected with RV\u2010SA11 for 3 and 9 hr. Interestingly, analyses of GFP expression by immunoblotting showed siRNA\u2010mediated targeted knock\u2010down of GFP to be apparent in mock\u2010infected cells as well as in cells infected with RV\u2010SA11 for 9 hr but not in RV\u2010SA11\u2010infected cells harvested at 3\u2010hr postinfection (3 hpi; Figure 1a). We ruled out transfection of siGFP to have any off\u2010target effects on overall RV infection as relative expression of RV structural and nonstructural proteins remained unperturbed (Figure 1a; Figure S1A). Visualisation by immunofluorescence microscopy (10\u00d7 magnification) in MA104 cells (Figure 1b) and HEK293 cells (Figure S1B) also revealed ectopic expression of GFP to be sensitive to RNAi only at 9 hpi but not at 3 hpi, suggesting time point\u2010dependent differential regulation of RNAi during RV\u2010SA11 infection. Rhodamine\u2010conjugated NSP5 visualised in RV\u2010infected samples under higher magnification (63\u00d7 oil immersion) ensured progressive infection (Figure 1b, panel 5). Next, we investigated whether RNAi targeted against any endogenous cellular protein was also regulated similarly during early and late hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection. MA104 cells, transfected with scrambled siRNA or RING\u2010box protein 1 (Rbx1)\u2010specific siRNA for 36 hr, were subsequently mock\u2010infected or infected with RV\u2010SA11. Consistent to our previous results, Rbx1 expression was successfully knocked down in response to Rbx1 siRNA in RV\u2010SA11\u2010infected cells lysed at 9 hpi as well as in mock\u2010infected control but not in RV\u2010SA11\u2010infected cells harvested at 3 hpi (Figure 1c), further indicating hindrance of RNAi mechanism during early hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection. Furthermore, sensitivity of RV protein expression to shRNA\u2010mediated RNAi in infection scenario was analysed. MA104 cells expressing shRNA against VP4 for 24 hr were subsequently infected with RV\u2010SA11, and expression of VP4 was checked after 6 and 12 hr of infection. In agreement with previous reports (Arias et al., 2004; D\u00e9ctor et al., 2002), expressions of VP4 RNA and protein were found to be silenced at 12 hpi (Figure S1C; Figure 1d), suggesting sensitivity of viral protein expression to RNAi at late phase of RV\u2010SA11 infection. Interestingly, shRNA\u2010mediated silencing of VP4 expression was attenuated at 6 hpi (Figure S1C; Figure 1d), affirming our previous observation that functional competence of siRNA is lost during early phase of RV\u2010SA11 infection.",

MA104 cells, transfected with either miR\u201029b mimic or scrambled miR for 36 hr, were subsequently infected with RV\u2010SA11 for 3 and 9 hr. One set of transfected cells was mock infected. Interestingly, following miR\u201029b overexpression, reduction of miR\u201029b target P85\u03b1 subunit of PI3K (Park, Lee, Ha, Nam, & Kim, 2009) was evident in both mock\u2010infected cells and RV\u2010infected cells for 3 (early time point) and 9 hr (late time point; Figure 1e). Consistently, much alike to mock\u2010infected group, sensitivity of luciferase expression from pMIR\u2010REPORT Luciferase vector containing 3\u2032\u2010UTR of P85\u03b1 subunit of PI3K in HEK293 cells to cotransfected miR\u201029b mimic (20 and 40 nM) was also found to be unaffected at both early (3 hpi) and late (9 hpi) hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection (Figure 1f). Collectively, the results suggest that though inhibition of siRNA and shRNA\u2010mediated RNAi occurs during early hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection, functionality of miRNA is retained during the same infection window.",

Interestingly, compared with the corresponding mock\u2010infected controls, cellular protein levels of AGO2 decreased during 2\u20136\u2010hr post RV\u2010SA11 infection in MA104 (Figure 2a), HT29 (Figure S2A), and HEK293 (data not shown) cell line. At relatively late time points of infection (\u22658 hpi), protein level of AGO2 was restored (Figure 2a; Figure S2A). However, AGO1 protein level was found to be reduced during late hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection (9\u201312 hpi; Figure 2a; Figure S2A). Levels of AGO3 and AGO4, two other members of AGO family proteins in mammals, as well as DICER, remained unchanged with respect to their respective mock\u2010infected controls throughout indicated time period (2\u201312 hpi) of RV\u2010SA11 infection (Figure 2a; Figure S2A). Confocal microscopy and subsequent quantitation of corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) also revealed AGO2 expression to get reduced at 3 hpi compared with the mock\u2010infected control only to restore and be distinctly visible again at 9 hpi (Figure 2b). Intracellular distribution of AGO2, however, was found to be somewhat different at 9 hpi from that in mock\u2010infected control (Figure 2b). Furthermore, infection with UV\u2010treated RV\u2010SA11 (Smirnov, Kapitulets, Amitina, Ginevskaya, & Kaverin, 1991) had no effect on AGO2 protein levels postinfection (Figure S2B). Together, the data suggest that actively replicating RV\u2010SA11 triggers attenuation in protein levels of AGO2 leading to functional blocking of RNAi during early time points (2\u20136 hpi) of infection.",

Owing to previous reports of RV\u2010NSP1 being involved in triggering degradation of multitude of host proteins, which are regulators of host cellular innate immunity (Arnold, Barro, & Patton, 2013; Bagchi, Bhowmick, Nandi, Kant Nayak, & Chawla\u2010Sarkar, 2013; Barro & Patton, 2007; Bhowmick, Halder, Chattopadhyay, Nayak, & Chawla\u2010Sarkar, 2013; Bhowmick, Mukherjee, Patra, & Chawla\u2010Sarkar, 2015; Graff, Ettayebi, & Hardy, 2009; Graff, Ewen, Ettayebi, & Hardy, 2007; Graff, Mitzel, Weisend, Flenniken, & Hardy, 2002; Qin et al., 2011), the involvement of RV\u2010NSP1 was investigated in the process. RV\u2010NSP1, but not RV\u2010NSP4, overexpression by itself resulted in significant reduction of AGO2 protein level in MA104 (Figure 3a) cell line. Decrease of Pan3 (Bhowmick et al., 2015) and induction of Ser616 phosphoDrp1(Ser616 pDrp1; Mukherjee et al., 2018) served as positive controls for RV\u2010NSP1 and RV\u2010NSP4 overexpression, respectively (Figure 3a). RV\u2010NSP1\u2010mediated degradation of AGO2 was also evident in HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNSP1 (Figure S3A). AGO1 levels, however, remained unchanged in RV\u2010NSP1\u2010overexpressing cells (Figure 3a). Of note, overexpression of none of the other RV structural and nonstructural proteins resulted in AGO2 protein level reduction when transfected individually (data not shown). Gradual reduction of AGO2 protein levels in a dose\u2010dependent manner in response to escalated concentration of transfected RV\u2010NSP1 further ascertained the role of this viral NSP in modulating AGO2 levels (Figure S3B). Furthermore, infection with bovine RV strain A5\u201313 possessing wild\u2010type NSP1 (Taniguchi, Kojima, & Urasawa, 1996) also resulted in reduced AGO2 protein levels (2\u20136 hpi) whereas corresponding NSP1 mutant RV strain A5\u201316 (Taniguchi et al., 1996) failed to decrease AGO2 during the same infection window (Figure 3b). Time kinetics of NSP1 mRNA and protein expression in RV\u2010A5\u201313\u2010 and RV\u2010SA11\u2010infected cells showed gradual accumulation as a function of time point postinfection (Figure S3C; Figure 3b).",

            "text": "Subsequent investigations revealed that irreversible inhibition of proteasome with 1 \u03bcM of lactacystin prevented RV\u2010NSP1\u2010mediated decline of AGO2 levels (Figure 3c). This was also supported by similar restoration of AGO2 protein levels in RV\u2010NSP1\u2010transfected cells in response to 5 \u03bcM of reversible proteasome inhibitor MG\u2010132 but not to 1 \u03bcM of lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (Figure S3D). In addition to the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase activity intrinsic to RV\u2010NSP1, co\u2010opted host E3 ubiquitin ligase complex Cullin has recently been implicated to be interacting with (Ding et al., 2016; Lutz, Pace, & Arnold, 2016) and be involved in mediating proteasomal degradation of host substrates (Davis, Morelli, & Patton, 2017; Ding et al., 2016). Interestingly, inhibition of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Cullin by MLN4924 (500 nM) failed to rescue RV\u2010NSP1\u2010mediated reduction in AGO2 levels in MA104 cells (Figure 3d), suggesting AGO2 degradation by RV\u2010NSP1 to be independent of co\u2010opted Cullin machinery. Disappearance of neddylated forms of Cullin1 and Cullin3 confirmed functional inactivation of Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase in MLN4924\u2010treated cells (Figure 3d). Dispensability of Cullin1 and Cullin3 as the E3 ubiquitin ligases co\u2010opted by RV\u2010NSP1 for degradation of AGO2 was further validated when AGO2 degradation was not prevented in RV\u2010NSP1\u2010transfected cells cotransfected with dominant negative constructs of Cullin1 and Cullin3 (Figure S3E). To further assess whether proteasomal degradation of AGO2 is preceded by increased ubiquitination, MA104 cells transfected with pCMV\u2010FLAG\u2010Ub were further cotransfected with either pcDNA6B or pcDNSP1; 36\u2010hr posttransfection, equal amount of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti\u2010FLAG antibody, and immunoprecipitates were assessed for the levels of AGO2. Results revealed distinctly increased ubiquitination of AGO2 in the presence of RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 3e, left panel). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation study substantiated ubiquitin enrichment of AGO2 in RV\u2010NSP1\u2010overexpressing cells (Figure 3e, right panel). Ubiquitin enrichment of AGO2 was also validated during early hours (at 3 hpi) of RV\u2010SA11 infection by coimmunoprecipitation study (Figure S3F). Notably, ubiquitinated AGO2 levels were found to be low at 9 hpi compared with 3 hpi, justifying their corresponding cellular levels represented in the input lanes (Figure S3F).",

Results revealed that overexpression of only RING domain of RV\u2010NSP1 was sufficient to cause AGO2 degradation (Figure 3f). Degradation of P53 was simultaneously assessed as a positive control. Consistent to the previous report (Bhowmick et al., 2013), P53 reduction was observed only in the presence of full\u2010length RV\u2010NSP1 but not in the presence of either RING or \u0394RING domain of NSP1 (Figure 3f). Role of NSP1 RING domain in degrading AGO2 was also validated in HEK293 cell line (Figure S3G). Furthermore, increased ubiquitination of AGO2 in the presence of only RING domain of NSP1 (Figure 3g) confirmed its role in ubiquitinaton\u2010mediated proteasomal degradation of AGO2.",

            "text": "The observation that RV\u2010NSP1 can cause proteasomal degradation of AGO2 prompted us to check whether RV\u2010NSP1 can also function as a suppressor of RNA silencing. To evaluate this, Rbx1 protein expression was assessed in MA104 cells transfected with either Rbx1 siRNA alone or pcDNSP1 in addition to Rbx1 siRNA. Immunoblotting revealed inefficient knocking down of Rbx1 expression by siRNA in the presence of RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 4a). Sensitivity of ectopic GFP (pEGFP\u2010N1) expression to siGFP was also reduced in RV\u2010NSP1\u2010overexpressing cells (Figure S4A), indicating that RV\u2010NSP1 might serve as an RNA\u2010silencing suppressor. Furthermore, silencing of VP4 expression by VP4 shRNA at 6 hpi was observed only in RV\u2010A5\u201316 (NSP1\u2010mutant)\u2010infected cells but not during RV\u2010A5\u201313 infection (Figure 4b; Figure S4B). This is consistent to no degradation of AGO2 in A5\u201316 infected cells compared with sharp degradation of AGO2 in isogenic strain A5\u201313 during 2\u20136 hpi (Figure 3b). Functionality of miRNA\u2010mediated RNAi, however, remained unaffected in the presence of RV\u2010NSP1 as observed by the equal competence of miR\u201029b mimic in attenuating its target (P85\u03b1 subunit of PI3K) both in the presence and absence of overexpressed RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 4c). Furthermore, overexpression of RV\u2010NSP1 in HEK293 cell line cotransfected with escalated concentration of miR\u201029b mimic could not hinder target (P85\u03b1 subunit of PI3K) repression capacity of miR\u201029b as evident by the luciferase reporter assay data (Figure 4d). Together, the results suggest that RV\u2010NSP1 can be regarded as a putative RV\u2010encoded suppressor of RNAi, which inhibits functionality of siRNA and shRNA but not of miRNA.",

The presence of AGO2 in the immunoprecipitate indicated an association between AGO2 and RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 5a). The presence of P53 and absence of AGO1 in the immunoprecipitate served as positive and negative control, respectively, for this interaction assay (Figure 5a). Similar observation was also made in HEK293 cell line (Figure S5A). As both AGO2 (Oceguera et al., 2018) and RV\u2010NSP1 (Hua, Chen, & Patton, 1994) were previously reported to interact with viral RNA, we went on to investigate whether the association between RV\u2010NSP1 and AGO2 required viral RNA intermediates. Interestingly, AGO2\u2010RV\u2010NSP1 association was found to be unperturbed in the presence of both single\u2010stranded RNA\u2010specific RNase I and double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010specific RNase III (Figure 5b), excluding the possibility of viral RNA scaffold to have a mediating role. AGO2 activity has been reported to be regulated by phosphorylation (Bridge et al., 2017; Horman et al., 2013). Phosphorylation of RV\u2010OSU\u2010NSP1 by caesin kinase II has also recently been shown to be a prerequisite for NSP1\u2010\u03b2TrCP association (Davis et al., 2017). To further explore whether association between RV\u2010NSP1 and AGO2 is influenced by phosphorylation status of either NSP1 or AGO2, coimmunoprecipitation analysis was carried out in the presence of lambda protein phosphatase (lambda PP). NSP1\u2010AGO2 association was not hampered following dephosphorylation of lysates with lambda PP, suggesting phosphorylation\u2010independent interaction between RV\u2010NSP1 and AGO2 (Figure 5c).",

Consistently, during early hours of infection (3 hpi), RV\u2010NSP1 was present in the anti\u2010AGO2 immunoprecipitate (Figure 5e), but at later time point (12 hpi), association between AGO2 and RV\u2010NSP1 reduced significantly (Figure 5e). This further confirms correlation between restoration of AGO2 protein levels and RNAi functionality during later hours of RV infection. Indeed, this temporal regulation of AGO2\u2010RV\u2010NSP1 association during infection was found to be insensitive to lambda PP treatment (Figure S5B).

We therefore went on to characterise the region of AGO2 needed for association with RV\u2010NSP1. Coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed using four FLAG\u2010tagged AGO2 mutants [AGO2\u2010mt1 {\u0394PIWI (\u0394518\u2010860aa)}, AGO2\u2010mt2 {\u0394PIWI+\u0394MID (\u0394373\u2010860aa)}, AGO2\u2010mt3 {\u0394N + \u0394PAZ (\u03941\u2010372aa)}, and AGO2\u2010mt4 {\u0394N (\u03941\u2010226aa)}] (Figure 5f, left panel). Expression of these constructs after transfection was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti\u2010FLAG antibody. Each of the AGO2 mutants was cotransfected with pcDNSP1 in MA104 cells, and cell lysates were further subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti\u2010FLAG antibody. Assessing the presence of RV\u2010NSP1 in each of the anti\u2010FLAG immunoprecipitates showed that deletion of 1\u2010372aa (AGO2\u2010mt3) from N terminus of AGO2 abolishes its ability to coimmunoprecipitate RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 5f, right panel). Barring AGO2\u2010mt3, the rest of the AGO2 mutants (AGO2\u2010mt1, AGO2\u2010mt2 and AGO2\u2010mt4), which were found to associate with RV\u2010NSP1, contain the PAZ domain (227\u2010372aa; Figure 5f, right panel). These results suggest that the region of 227\u2010372aa of AGO2 (possibly encompassing the PAZ domain) might be involved in the association with RV\u2010NSP1. To further confirm NSP1\u2010AGO2\u2010PAZ association, MA104 cells ectopically expressing pcDNSP1 were further cotransfected with AGO2 construct containing PAZ domain (FLAG\u2010PAZ, 1\u2013480 aa) or AGO2 construct without the PAZ domain (FLAG\u2010PIWI, 478\u2013860 aa). In agreement with the previous results, NSP1\u2010AGO2 association was found in the presence of FLAG\u2010PAZ but not of FLAG\u2010PIWI, confirming involvement of PAZ domain of AGO2 in association with NSP1 (Figure S5C).",

Attenuation of RV RNA upon AGO2 overexpression was also significantly prominent at 12 hpi in conventional RT\u2010PCR\u2010based studies (Figure S6C). Moreover, antiviral potency of AGO2 overexpression was found to be evident at as late as 24 and 48 hpi (Figure 6b).

Results showed that all the AGO2 mutants are less potent in exerting antiviral effect compared with the full\u2010length AGO2 (Figure 6c; Figure S6F), suggesting requirement of full\u2010length AGO2 protein for the best antiviral efficacy. Loss of antiviral potency of AGO2, however, is more prominent in the presence of PIWI domain deleted AGO2 mutants (AGO2\u2010mt1 and AGO2\u2010mt2) compared with PIWI domain containing AGO2 mutants (AGO2\u2010mt3 and AGO2\u2010mt4; Figure 6c; Figure S6F). Notably, overexpression of AGO2\u2010mt3 showed slightly yet consistently better anti\u2010rotaviral property than that of AGO2\u2010mt4 (Figure 6c; Figure S6F).

In spite of their universality and ubiquitousness, VSRs are highly divergent within and across kingdoms with no sequence homology and have been hypothesised to have evolved independently in different viruses (Burgess, 2013). Viruses\u2010infecting mammalian cells, on the other hand, are only sensitive to synthetic siRNAs that bypass the requirement of Dicer for being processed but produce very little viRNAs during natural course of infection (Cullen & Cherry, 2013). This is possibly due to decreased Dicer\u2010processing activity, which occurs during cellular differentiation perhaps via modification of its internal auto\u2010inhibitory helicase domain. Interestingly, inability to mount RNAi\u2010based innate immunity in response to invading dsRNAs has well been superseded in higher vertebrates by an evolutionary advantageous IFN\u2010based innate immune response. There are, however, contrasting reports on functional coexistence of RNAi and IFN in differentiated somatic cells of mammals. Retention of functional RNAi in IFN\u2010deficient undifferentiated germ cells and embryonic stem cells suggests an attracting hypothesis that RNAi\u2010based antiviral response is subdued in the presence of IFN in higher vertebrates. In favour of this hypothesis is the observation that antiviral RNAi can be experimentally unmasked in mammalian cells upon ablation of the IFN pathway (Maillard et al., 2016). In contrast, there are reports of incompatibility between functional coexistence of RNAi and IFN, as RNAi components are postulated to be proviral and therefore inhibited under certain IFN\u2010rich conditions (Backes et al., 2014).",

This view is supported by (a) the lack of detectable signature viRNA population in mammalian cells after infection with wild\u2010type viruses and (b) the loss of virulence characteristics of VSR\u2010deficient mutant viruses in mammalian cells owing to the production of abundant viRNAs.",

Intriguingly, we found infection time point\u2010dependent bimodal regulation of RNAi, where RNAi showed differential sensitivity at early and late hours of RV infection. siRNA\u2010guided RNAi targeting ectopically expressed GFP (Figure 1a,b, Figure S1A, B), and endogenous gene Rbx1 (Figure 1c) and shRNA\u2010mediated RNAi targeting rotaviral vp4 gene (Figure 1d, Figure S1C) were all found to be blocked at early hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection only to regain full functionality at relatively late hours. Evidence of abrogated functionality of synthetic siRNAs suggests that hindered Dicer activity cannot be the exclusive reason for RNAi inhibition during early hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection. In contrast, functionality of miRNA is retained, as miRNA mimics successfully knocked\u2010down target expression both at early and late hours of RV\u2010SA11 infection (Figure 1e,f). This is in agreement with our previous findings, where miRNA mimics preserved their target repression potency in context of RV\u2010SA11 infection (Chanda, Nandi, & Chawla\u2010Sarkar, 2016; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019).

            "text": "Interestingly, inhibition of siRNA\u2010mediated RNAi 3\u2010hr post RV\u2010SA11 infection coincided with the diminished protein levels of AGO2, but not other AGOs, at that particular time point (2\u20136 hpi; Figure 2a,b; Figure S2A). AGOs are the catalytic work powers of RISC. Mammals possess four isoforms of AGOs, which share a conserved bilobed structural architecture with four globular domains\u2014the N\u2010terminal lobe consisting of an extreme N\u2010terminal domain followed by a PAZ domain (PIWI\u2010AGO\u2010Zwille), which are separated by a Linker (L1) and a C\u2010terminal lobe with MID (Middle) and PIWI (P body induced wimpy testes) domains. The two lobes are connected by a second Linker (L2) region. The two lobes form a central cleft\u2010like structure with the C\u2010terminal half forming the base of the cleft. In mammalian cells, AGO2 is the only AGO isoform with RNase H\u2010like endonucleolytic activity (slicing) essential for siRNA\u2010mediated target mRNA cleavage (Liu et al., 2004; Rivas et al., 2005; Willkomm, Zander, Grohmann, & Restle, 2016). In the slicing AGO2, the central cleft spanning the PIWI domain harbours the endonucleolytic active site, which cradles the guide and target nucleic acid molecules. AGO proteins are also essential for loading guide RNA onto RISC, where the 5\u2032 phosphate terminal of the guide strand is buried in the hydrophilic pocket within the MID domain, and the 3\u2032 2 nucleotide overhang is lodged in the shallow pocket of PAZ domain. The extreme N\u2010terminal domain is involved in unwinding the RNA duplexes. Interestingly, nonslicing AGOs, which are outcompeted by AGO2 when AGO2 is present, may serve redundant functions in AGO2's absence. Therefore, in the absence of AGO2, loading in RISC and miRNA\u2010guided knock\u2010down can be taken over by other nonslicing reserve AGOs to sustain cell viability. In agreement with this is the observation that all AGOs have been shown to bind to miRNAs and siRNAs indiscriminately of sequence, to interact with a common set of helicases and miRNA\u2010binding proteins and to localise to P bodies in mammalian cells (Ruda et al., 2014). Indeed, availability of nonslicing AGOs during early hours of RV infection (Figure 2a, Figure S2A) might be the reason behind retention of miRNA functionality when AGO2 was degraded. It is also noteworthy that inhibition of RNAi correlated with active RV replication as degradation of AGO2 was not observed during infection with UV\u2010inactivated RV (Figure S2B) or in the presence of antiviral agents (such as antiviral siRNAs), which result in overall inhibition of RV replication. Efficient silencing of proviral proteins before the onset of infection abrogates viral infection as a whole thereby jeopardising AGO2 depletion (Bagchi et al., 2012; Chattopadhyay et al., 2017), which, in turn, may act as a confounding factor for assessing silencing efficiency at postinfective period.",

RV\u2010NSP1 is a multifunctional protein involved in IFN antagonism, activation of pro\u2010survival PI3K/Akt pathways, denucleating cytoplasmic P bodies, and also harbouring RNA binding as well as cytoskeleton localisation domain (Bagchi et al., 2013; Bhowmick et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2016; Lutz et al., 2016; Morelli, Ogden, & Patton, 2015). IFN antagonistic properties of RV\u2010NSP1 lies in its ability to trigger proteasomal destruction of IRF3, 5, 7, 9, \u03b2\u2010TrCP, TRAF2, and RIG\u2010I, whereas P body destabilising property of NSP1 includes degradation of Pan3 by ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system. RV\u2010NSP1 possesses a highly conserved N\u2010terminal RING domain with a zinc\u2010finger motif (C\u2010X2\u2010C\u2010X8\u2010C\u2010X2\u2010C\u2010X3\u2010H\u2010X\u2010C\u2010X2\u2010C\u2010X5\u2010C consensus), which was postulated to have putative E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In this study, RV\u2010NSP1\u2010mediated AGO2 degradation was prevented in the presence of proteasome inhibitors but not lysosome inhibitor (Figure 3c; Figure S3D). Moreover, ubiquitin enrichment of AGO2 was also observed when full\u2010length or N\u2010terminal region of RV\u2010NSP1 was overexpressed (Figure 3e,g). The role of RV\u2010NSP1 in reducing AGO2 protein levels was further confirmed when AGO2 degradation was observed only during A5\u201313 infection (a bovine RV strain with wild\u2010type NSP1\u2010containing RING domain [105\u2013246 nucleotides]; cytoskeleton localisation domain [246\u2013531], and IRF3\u2010binding domain [531\u2013981], respectively;Bagchi et al., 2010 ; Taniguchi et al., 1996) but not in cells infected with A5\u201316 (NSP1\u2010mutant bovine RV strain, which has a 500\u2010nucleotide deletion from nucleotides 142 to 641 followed by an immediate stop codon at positions 183 to 185, indicating the lack of a functional RING domain and cytoskeleton localisation domain; Taniguchi et al., 1996; Bagchi et al., 2010; Figure 3b). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies subsequently showed RV\u2010NSP1 to associate with the PAZ domain containing span of AGO2 via its own N\u2010terminal domain independent of any RNA intermediates and residue phosphorylation, justifying degradation of AGO2 in presence of N\u2010terminal domain of RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 5a\u2013d, F; Figure S5A, C). This is in contrast to the fact that substrate binding specificity of RV\u2010NSP1 generally lies in its highly variable C\u2010terminal half (Lutz et al., 2016; Morelli et al., 2015). The association between AGO2 and RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 5e, Figure S5B) as well as ubiquitin enrichment of AGO2 (Figure S3F) were also observed at early hour of RV\u2010SA11 infection. Interestingly, at relatively late hours, both association with RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 5e, Figure S5B) and ubiquitination of AGO2 decreased (Figure S3F), partially explaining restoration of AGO2 protein levels at these late time points of infection.",

Reversal of AGO2 degradation, however, was observed in presence of neither dominant negative forms of Cullin1 and Cullin3 nor pan\u2010Cullin inhibitor MLN4924, suggesting that RV\u2010NSP1\u2010mediated degradation of AGO2 is not dependent on co\u2010opted CRLs (Figure 3d; Figure S3E). Molecular mechanisms governing time point\u2010dependent bimodal regulation of AGO2\u2010NSP1 association and possible involvement of co\u2010opted host E3 ubiquitin ligase, however, remain to be investigated in future. Moreover, on the basis of our previous observation of p53\u2013NSP1 interaction to get regulated in a similar bimodal fashion (Bhowmick et al., 2013), we also cannot rule out the possibility of mutual inaccessibility of RV\u2010NSP1 or its interaction partner to each other during late phase of infection as a result of differential subcellular relocalisation. In agreement with Schuster, Tholen, Overheul, van Kuppeveld, and van Rij (2017) and Schuster, Miesen, and van Rij (2019), however, we can make a hypothesis on the physiological relevance of time point\u2010dependent bimodal AGO2 regulation. According to this notion, biphasic AGO2 modulation by RV\u2010NSP1 relies on the prioritisation preference of the latter to get invested either in crippling antiviral RNAi during relatively early phase of infection or antagonising host\u2010triggered antiviral IFN response during the later phase. From the perspective of RV\u2010NSP1 as a putative VSR, degrading AGO2 to disarm si/shRNA\u2010mediated RNAi is advantageous during early hours of infection. But as infection progresses and RV dsRNAs accumulate above a certain threshold, host pattern recognition receptors (RIG1 and MDA5) can start recognising viral replication intermediates as non\u2010self entities and respond by triggering antiviral IFN signalling (Broquet, Hirata, McAllister, & Kagnoff, 2011). To counteract this, RV employs NSP1 to degrade IFN regulatory factors ultimately escaping host immune response. Evidence for viral IFN antagonist to also serve as a VSR is strikingly abundant (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006; Hartman, Towner, & Nichol, 2004).",

            "text": "VSRs have been reported to interfere at different stages of RNA silencing pathways: viral RNA sensing and dicing, RISC assembly, AGO activity/levels, and also by targeting accessory components of RISC. Most of the VSRs are dsRNA\u2010binding proteins that interact with either Dicer substrates, siRNA duplexes, or both and sequester them away from RNA silencing pathway (Bronkhorst & van Rij, 2014; Schuster et al., 2019). In this respect, it is noteworthy that bacterial dsRNA\u2010binding proteins can also inhibit RNAi pathway non\u2010specifically by virtue of their binding to dsRNAs and thereby withdrawing dsRNAs away from RNAi machinery. There are a few reports of degradation of AGO2 in case of insect and plant viruses (Baumberger, Tsai, Lie, Havecker, & Baulcombe, 2007; Nayak et al., 2018), but no report is available for mammalian viruses. Consistent with the ability of RV\u2010NSP1 to degrade AGO2 proteasomally, RV\u2010NSP1 also showed putative VSR property as its ectopic expression prevented siRNA\u2010mediated RNAi (Figure 4a; Figure S4A). Concurrently, shRNA\u2010mediated RNAi was also found to be functional during early and late hours of A5\u201316 infection (Figure 4b, Figure S4B). VSR mutant viruses have been shown to be attenuated strains and can only attain high pathogenicity in RNAi\u2010defective host cells. NSP1\u2010mutant RV strain A5\u201316 has also been reported to have slow growth rate and forms smaller plaques compared with wild\u2010type RV strain A5\u201313 (Taniguchi et al., 1996; Bagchi et al., 2010). However, the difference in the virulence phenotype between wild\u2010type A5\u201313 and NSP1 mutant A5\u201316 may arise, at least partially, from activation of premature apoptosis and failure of IFN antagonism. So, it poses an experimental challenge to uncouple attenuated pathogenicity stemming from failure to antagonise IFN and premature apoptosis from that due to failure of RNAi inhibition. Indeed, as also observed previously during infection, miRNA mimics retained their functionality in the presence of RV\u2010NSP1 (Figure 4c,d).",

In our study too, overexpression of AGO2 but not AGO1 showed potent anti\u2010rotaviral activity (Figure 6a,b; Figure S6 B\u2013E). This is rationally consistent with recent reports of increased RV infectivity in the absence of AGO2 (Dhillon & DurgaRao, 2018; Oceguera et al., 2018). Moreover, all the functional domains of AGO2 were found to be important for exerting the best antiviral potency, the catalytic PIWI domain being the major determinant (Figure 6c,d; Figure S6F,G) as PIWI domain deleted as well as catalytically dead AGO2 mutants failed to show antiviral effects.",

Subsequent studies revealed AGO2 to be associating with RV\u2010NSP1 resulting in its ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction independent of co\u2010opted host CRLs. Involvement of RV\u2010NSP1, a classical IFN antagonist, in functioning as a VSR, surprisingly, is not an exception from other mammalian viruses underpinning an interesting and yet\u2010unexplored relationship between the two potential antiviral strategies. It is nonetheless important to mention here that the degree of RV\u2010induced RNAi inhibition, which is attained experimentally by transfecting si/shRNAs way before (36 hr) RV\u2010SA11 infection will vary greatly depending upon the knock\u2010down efficiency of the target achieved prior to infection and also upon the expression kinetics of the target during the period of RNAi inhibition. From the perspective of viral physiology, however, crippling siRNA\u2010mediated RNAi makes sense as signature viRNAs, if indeed produced from the RV genome, would hypothetically be rendered non\u2010functional in the absence of AGO2 during early hours of RV infection and in the absence of abundantly exposed transcriptive/replicative dsRNA substrates beyond that potentially vulnerable early infective phase.",
