Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called \"Icells\". By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for \"off-the-shelf\" frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS-CoV-2 are expressed on the surface of irradiated target Icells. Utilizing this innovative strategy, these viral antigen-displaying decoy cells will be developed as a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease. Enabling the delivery and presentation of pathogen-specific proteins expressed in their native conformation to the host immune system, overcoming the known delivery and conformational inefficiencies associated with nucleic acid and recombinant protein-based approaches is a critical component of successful vaccine development.",
