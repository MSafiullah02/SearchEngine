            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, is a chronic respiratory infectious disease that is transmitted most commonly through cough aerosols [1], [2]. Despite heroic efforts to combat this devastating disease, TB remains a major global health issue with a vast health burden due to the high incidence, medical expenses, drug resistance and co-infections. In 2015, it was estimated that there were 10.4 million new infections and 1.8 million deaths caused by TB worldwide [3], [4]. In China, owing to the lack of healthcare resources and absence of essential medical services, TB has spread widely with serious harmful effects on the health of the population [5]. In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) strategy comprising two key factors: directly observed treatments and short course chemotherapy. This strategy was implemented in 13 provinces, inhabited by more than 560 million people [6]. With the arrival of the 21st century, the Chinese government has made great efforts to achieve comprehensive control of TB by devising and implementing the State Council of China National TB Control Program (2001\u20132010) in 2001, and expanding the DOTS program to the entire country by 2005 [7]. For the sustainable development of TB control, the State Council of China issued a new TB prevention and control program in the \u201c12th Five-Year Plan\u201d [8]. However, China remained one of the three countries with the highest burden of TB cases in 2015 (combined, 45% of the global total), which was only marginally lower than India [3].",

To achieve this, mathematical and statistical models are required to forecast TB occurrence as an early warning system. The auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is a frequently used model for forecasting the incidence of epidemic diseases, including TB. This system is used to model the temporal dependence structure of a time series, taking into account changing trends, periodic changes, and random disturbances in the time series [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].",

In the case of a no-white noise time series, there is a correlation with observed values with a non-random distribution, and can be used to build a model. As the most common method of unit root testing, an Augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller (ADF) test was adopted to determine whether the time series is stationary. If the time series is non-stationary, differencing could be used effectively to remove this trend. Based on the sequence diagrams and practical experiences, the seasonality of the time series can be explored.(2)Identification and estimation: Determining the orders of the SARIMA model on the basis of graphs for the auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF). The least square method was used to estimate the model parameters.(3)Diagnosis and optimization: The availability of the model required verification by parameters and white noise tests. The Q-test was employed to diagnose the white noise of the residual errors, which are independent and normally distributed. The significance of a single parameter was evaluated by means of a t-test.(4)Prediction: The obtained model was applied to fit the incidence of TB from January 2004 to December 2015. Finally, the optimal model was determined with the help of accuracy tests, and used for predicting the incidence of TB.\n",

The forecast results indicated that the TB incidence was likely to increase only slightly over the subsequent six months. The factors that contribute to a rise in the incidence of TB are complex and further research is required to clarify this issue. The SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,1)12 clearly represents a useful tool for monitoring TB incidence and forecasting TB epidemics. Thus, it is important that the health departments adopt this model as the basis of an early warning system that will allow the timely application of enhanced surveillance and reallocation of medical resources [19]. On 16th February 2017, the General Office of the State Council of China issued the \u201c13th Five-Year Plan\u201d including the National Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Planning, which proposed the full use of information management [20]. In particular, this measure will be conducive to the implementation of a high efficiency forecasting model for epidemic surveillance and as a treatment reference.",

From an overall perspective, the monthly incidence of TB from January 2004 to December 2015 peaked in January and March, with a trough in December. Other studies have shown that the seasonal distribution of TB incidence in China is similar to that in other countries. For instance, the peak of TB prevalence in Portugal is March, with a trough is December [23]. In the United States as a whole, the peak prevalence is also in March, while the trough occurs in November [24], while in New York, the incidence of TB peaked in spring or summer, with the trough occurring in the fall [25]. In Iran, the peak TB incidence appeared in spring [26]. The peak incidence of TB is mainly caused by new disease spread and increased incidence of latent infections; therefore, studies of the peak seasonal incidence peak should take into account the delay in diagnosis [27]. A previous study showed that the median TB patient delay is 93 days (range 68\u2013128 days) [28]. Missed the early diagnosis and variable incubation periods of TB, will not only lead to a longer infectious period and increased transmission rates, but will also limit the reliability of the TB surveillance system and the effects of an early warning system [19], [29]. Furthermore, it is important to note that the Spring Festival in China contributes to the increase in the incidence of TB in March by virtue of the increased travel around the Chinese lunar new year and population mobility [27], [30].",
