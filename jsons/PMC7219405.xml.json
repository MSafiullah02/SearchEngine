These developments were motivated by understanding both the chronic effects of persistent parasite infection (for example hookworm), the regularity of viral epidemics such as \u2018flu and measles, the emergence of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, and the initiation of large vaccination programmes (Agur et al., 1993; Anderson and May, 1985; Elveback et al., 1976; Grenfell and Anderson, 1989; Longini et al., 1984; May and Anderson, 1987). Whilst most modelling studies emerged from a small number of research groups, there are some notable exceptions (e.g. (Baroyan, 1963) for influenza in the USSR). Although the development of models in order to support policy making was well underway at the end of the 1980s, it was only later, with the emergence of affordable computational power following the advent of personal computers and the increasing availability of digital data, that effective tools to were developed or borrowed from other fields. This period ends about 1993 marked by the publication of Anderson & May (1993) and the series of meetings at the Newton Institute (Grenfell et al., 1995; Medley and Isham, 1996). Heesterbeek\u2019s thesis titled R0 and his notable seminar style in which he filled a blackboard with equations, marks the last point at which infectious disease modelling could be done on paper alone (Heesterbeek, 1992). The publications from those meetings are now notable by their lack of statistical innovation, and the apparent paucity of data.",

Iterative methods therefore became a vital component in the modeller\u2019s toolkit, alongside comparisons of model output to specific datasets by minimising the error between model and data, or by using approximations to simplify the set of estimated parameters. These approaches are illustrated within models applied to the use of the expectation maximisation algorithm to estimate parameters from HIV epidemics (Becker, 2016), the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak in UK livestock (Keeling et al., 2001; Tildesley et al., 2006), and estimating parameters from measles epidemics prior to the introduction of vaccination (Finkenst\u00e4dt et al., 2002).",

At the time, it was also not very practical for applied use: even with the most advanced tools available to the 1950s analyst, the original Metropolis paper reports that a run of less than 100 iterations took five hours to complete. These methods were brought more mainstream by Geman and Geman 1984, and Gelfand and Smith 1990. These methods, now referred to as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to approximate the posterior distribution has provided an incredibly useful and simple iterative method. It is particularly useful inside the Bayesian framework, but also any situation where a probability distribution can be derived by linking the data and the parameters of the model. It provides a way of exploring the parameter space and obtaining representative samples of the parameters compatible with the target distributions. We assume in this special issue that the essentials of MCMC are known. Readers who might want to look for more information in implementing MCMC can refer to (Gilks et al., 1996; van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2018).",

The arrival of Bayesian analysis Using Gibbs Sampling (BUGS) in the early 90 s as a user-friendly software for implementing MCMC brought Bayesian analysis to the mainstream and spurred a revolution in infectious disease modelling. BUGS remains a widely used tool for analysing data including from the perspective of infectious disease models (see Box 2 and Auzenbergs et. al. (2019) in this issue). The use of the BUGS language for fitting complex models gained popularity in many areas of infectious disease research, but some challenges to using SIR-like models prevented their widespread use, such as the acyclic nature of non-linear models. Until MCMC samplers became easier to write, and researchers skills in computational methods improved enough to write them, a second revolution was required in methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology.",

Specific policy questions have triggered the need for including new layers of heterogeneity and complexity to existing models. A notable example of this type of change is the inclusion of the age structure within transmission models using contact surveys (Mossong et al., 2008). This increase in model complexity has been driven by an improvement in understanding transmission; in the example by Mossong it has been the importance of age-structure in driving transmission of infectious diseases (in this case \u2018flu). Without including this model complexity, predictions in the effectiveness of interventions would be incorrect.",

            "text": "This model diversification has required the application of new inference methods, whether completely novel or borrowed from other fields and adapted to epidemiological studies. Developments in statistical methods applied to infectious diseases in this period include accounting for the incubation period to infer transmission from disease data (Donnelly et al., 2003), using data augmentation to account for asymptomatic/undetected transmission (Cauchemez et al., 2006) and likelihood-free parameter estimation (Toni et al., 2009). Fortunately, advances in computational capabilities, as well as advances in tools and software packages available have allowed for these developments. Infectious disease modellers now require skills in coding (often in several languages) and statistical inference, as well as an ability to manipulate and solve equations. However, with increasing model complexity, statistical inference becomes challenging and sometimes a distraction from the objectives of the analysis (ie. to capture the dynamics of infection through a population). Fortunately, shortcuts have been made increasingly available, such as packages to borrow inference from elsewhere and approximating the full likelihood, which has been helped by the sharing of code to complement equations within the papers. The increasing use of R and python software by researchers has also been transformational, as the software is relatively accessible and the use of libraries of additional code and wrappers to use other languages enable a rapid progression to carry out infectious disease modelling. To this end, several of the papers within this Special Edition make use of R libraries and various wrappers that port other languages into R (Auzenbergs et al., 2019; Chatzilena et al., 2019; Funk and King, 2020), making modelling more accessible.",

Whilst ideas related to this method have been circulating since at least the 1980s, only in the late 1990s did ABC in its current form start being applied, primarily in the field of genetics (Tavar\u00e9 et al., 1997). Central to ABCs usefulness is that instead of evaluating the likelihood, specific characteristics of the data are chosen by the researcher, and model output is compared to these characteristics (See Minter and Retkute (2019) in this issue and Box 3). The simplicity of the approach enables parameter estimation which would not otherwise be feasible, thus enabling more complex models to be fitted to data. The challenge then becomes the need to identify appropriate summary statistics.",

The practice of \u201creproducible research\u201d, including the sharing of code and associated data has become increasingly common and is now frequently requested by research funders (AMS, 2015). The STAN software platform is a great example of reusable software, as it allows researchers to efficiently implement complex methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Variational Inference (VI), both of which allow the fitting of more complex models than simpler MCMC algorithms.

One of the most fundamental is the \u201cclosed population\u201d, which only exist in very special circumstances such as boarding schools and isolated populations (Keeling and Grenfell, 1997). But people (and non-human hosts) move. An important problem at the time of writing is the emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19), initially in Wuhan, China (Riou and Althaus, 2020). As well as the need to rapidly understand the natural history of infection of this new virus, it is essential to understand how population movement will impact spread. An important part of the data revolution is the increasing ease with which we can collect geostatistical information; it is increasingly common to use flight data to estimate patterns of emergence and associate an individual with a precise and temporally changing spatial location, utilising GPS devices and smartphones (Wesolowski et al., 2015). The analysis of infectious disease spread in geographical space and time is an area requiring more attention. The paper by Milton et al. (see Box 6, (Milton et al., 2019)) is different from the others in the issue in that the dynamics are not at the centre of attention, but this approach represents one of our bets for the future. Infectious disease dynamics drive spatio-temporal statistical patterns on an aggregate level, providing an alternative angle for inference when strong assumptions on the transmission process cannot be justified. First considered for measles by Grenfell et al. (2001), methodology for analysing these patterns has been a major growth area and is likely to continue.",

The standardisation and integration of genomic sequencing, georeferencing, and the use of social media will only develop richer and more detailed data on which to build models. All these expansions contribute towards capturing heterogeneity in transmission, which is why their inclusion in many settings will be important. In particular, the inclusion of data-driven dynamic contact networks within infection models is starting to appear, particularly in veterinary disease contexts where the data exist (Orton et al., 2018). The embarrassment for the modeller will be not so much that there is no data to inform parameters (which was the norm 30 years ago), but that there is so much data that its not clear what the model structure should be to accommodate the data. In this context we are likely to see more and more machine learning approaches used to extract and simplify the relationships within the data. Big data and the associated tools to deal with big data might well be the third revolution for infectious disease modelling. With the increasing complexity of model and data streams it is likely that the field of infectious disease modelling will branch itself into many forms, if it hasn\u2019t already.",

Although this solves the problem of basing policy on a single model, it raises the problem of how to combine different model outcomes. Weighting the strength of evidence from each model seems a sensible approach, but choosing the weights is problematic. The majority of the approaches in this issue work in a Bayesian context, where the data and model are combined with prior information to inform parameter estimates and therefore model behaviour.
