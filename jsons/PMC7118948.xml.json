            "text": "For most of the 20th century, the prevailing dogma was that disease organisms eventually should evolve toward benign coexistence with their hosts; harmful diseases were interpreted as a transitory state of maladaptation [6], [7]. This belief has not been useful for ameliorating the suffering caused by infectious diseases, because it suggests that the occurrence of severe disease is bad luck and that not much can be done to control this evolutionary process. This view arose more from assumptions about the harmony of nature than from rigorous application of evolutionary principles. Specifically, it failed to cast the problem in the context of natural selection. Rather than asking whether harmful or mild variants would win out in competition with each other over the short run, the focus was on what was stable over the long run. Natural selection is powerless to favor long-term stability if the variants that win in the short term destabilize the system. Natural selection may favor the evolution of extreme harmfulness if the host exploitation that causes this harm enhances the competitive success of the harmful variants over benign variants in the short run. If predator-like variants of a pathogen population out-produce and out-transmit benign variants, benign coexistence may be precluded. Instead of generating long-term stability, the evolutionary conflict of interest between a predator-like pathogen and its host generates an evolutionary arms race in which pathogen and host each evolve characteristics that give them a leg up on the other, shifting the level of host exploitation closer to the optimum for the pathogen or that of the host.",

Over the past quarter century, however, the evolution of virulence has been broadly investigated by a theoretical framework that is based on the principles of natural selection [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. This framework offers explanations for the broad range of virulence found among host parasite relationships and offers possibilities for virulence management (ie, the control of diseases by controlling the evolution of virulence) [16]. The evolutionary framework also provides insight into the true scope of infectious causation of chronic disease and a sense of which diseases can be prevented or cured by developing disease-control strategies, such as vaccines and antibiotics.",

This follow-up comparison used historical data to assess the virulence of particular vector-borne pathogens in humans in relation to the degree to which the pathogen had evolved in response to vector-borne transmission between humans. Specifically, it compared the virulence of vector-borne pathogens that had just been transmitted to humans with the virulence of the same kind of vector-borne pathogen that had been cycling extensively in humans and should be better adapted to vector-borne transmission between humans. As expected from evolutionary theory, the pathogens that had been cycling in humans were more severe in humans than those that recently had been introduced to humans from some other vertebrate host [12]. The yellow fever virus, for example, was less deadly in humans just after it entered the human population than it was in outbreaks that involved extensive cycling of transmission between mosquitoes and humans.",

Logic dictates that this goal can be accomplished by mosquito proofing of dwellings. People who are immobilized by illness are more likely to be at home or in a hospital than people who do not feel ill; transmission from homes and hospitals therefore should tend to involve relatively virulent variants. When such dewllings are mosquito-proof, however, vectors cannot gain access to the severely ill people who are incapacitated inside these dewllings. The vectors will instead transmit pathogens from those infected people who feel healthy enough to get up out of bed and walk outdoors. These pathogens should tend to be relatively benign. The vector proofing of dwellings therefore should favor transmission of the benign strains from people in the outside environment instead of transmission of the more virulent strains that infect the bed-ridden. This favoring of benign strains through the mosquito proofing of dewllings would be manifested as an evolutionary decline in virulence.",

The intact toxin liberates nutrients to the bacterium by killing nearby human cells. The immunologic response to the toxoid vaccine neutralizes the toxin and causes the toxin to be a net drain on the bacterium's nutrient budget. Toxinless C diphtheriae still can infect and be transmitted from people [24]; the toxin therefore qualifies as a virulence antigen, because it makes viable benign pathogens harmful. When vaccination prevents the negative effects of the toxin, the toxinless strains should have a competitive advantage over the toxigenic strains, because the toxinless strains do not waste valuable resources by producing an ineffective toxin. Toxinless strains therefore should increase in frequency relative to toxigenic-strains wherever toxoid vaccines have been administered extensively. This transition is confirmed by the historical data [25], [26], [27], [28]. The most detailed data set came from the vaccination program administered in Romania from 1958 through 1972. As the acquired immunity rose to 97%, the percentage of isolates that produced toxin dropped from 86% to 3%, and diphtheria vanished [27].",

In other sexually transmitted diseases, the acute phase is inconspicuous or entirely lacking. HIV type 1 (HIV-1) causes a mild flu-like illness within about a month of the onset of infection but is generally lethal in its chronic phase.

If the host population is characterized by a low potential for sexual transmission, the chance of a partner change occurring soon after infection is low, and the advantages of a high shedding of pathogens soon after infection is also low. If sexual partners remain together for a long period of time, a low probability of infecting the partner per act of sexual intercourse is of little consequence to the probability of pathogen transmission between the partners, because a large number of sexual contacts will occur during the long-term relationship. The low potential for sexual transmission thus favors low levels of exploitation and low virulence.

Chronic diseases, however, pose a much greater threat over the near term, and something important probably can be done to control them if their causes are examined. These two claims may seem presumptuous at first. The worst plagues of history have been acute infectious diseases that spread swiftly and lethally through human populations. The most damaging examples generally have been well adapted to transmission through human populations, either directly from person to person or indirectly through a biologic vector, such as a mosquito, or a nonbiologic vehicle, such as water. These diseases as a rule were long-adapted to humans and caused their harm when they spread through previously unexposed human populations. Measles and smallpox decimated native populations in the Americas when they were introduced during the early colonial period [1], [2], [3], [4]. Syphilis probably caused large amounts of death in previously unexposed populations in Europe as a result of a reciprocal introduction into Europe from the New World [33], [34]. These outbreaks were devastating largely because they were introduced from human populations with which they had been in evolutionary arms races into populations that had no acquired immunity and little if any evolved resistance. Terrible new outbreaks of long-standing human diseases are unlikely to be a great threat in the future because the current high level of worldwide transportation is far greater than the level needed for global transport of well-adapted human pathogens. So far as is known, the only pathogens of humans that have not already been mixed globally by human travel are zoonotic (ie, newly introduced into humans from other species). Zoonotic diseases generally have limited potential for spread in human populations and therefore have little potential for causing devastating epidemics. AIDS is the only exception; however, even AIDS causes minor damage compared with the decimation that was caused in New World populations on contact with Old World pathogens.",

            "text": "Evolutionary theory, however, suggests that many if not most of the major chronic diseases of humans are caused by infection [35]. The logic leading to this conclusion involves a simple application of natural selection. There are three general categories of disease causation: genetic, parasitic, and nonparasitic environmental. (\u201cParasitic\u201d is broadly defined to include infectious causes.) Evolutionary considerations severely limit the feasibility of genetic causation for the most common severe chronic diseases, because such diseases tend to reduce any causal alleles down to a frequency that can be maintained by mutation [35]. If an allele provides some compensating benefit (as is the case with the allele for sickle cell anemia), it can be maintained, but few of the common and harmful diseases with unknown causes have characteristics that are consistent with such a scenario. Although a great amount of research effort has been spent on attempts to discover genetic causes of chronic diseases, this research generally has identified only genetic predispositions to common damaging diseases rather than direct causes. Even in the case of cancer, where mutational causes have been identified, these causes are insufficient to explain any more than a minuscule portion of human cancer without invoking other categories of causation. In no case has the research on genetic causation of chronic disease led to a practical breakthrough that decisively controls or cures any common and damaging chronic disease. In contrast to this lack of success, infectious causes of chronic diseases have been documented (Table 1\n), and preventive or curative interventions have been enacted (with vastly less funding). Peptic ulcers, stomach cancer, and liver cancer are recognized as being caused by infection. Peptic ulcers and some stomach cancer can be cured and prevented by antibiotic treatment [36], and many cases of liver cancer have been prevented by screening the blood supply for hepatitis B and C viruses. Infectious agents have been associated with a large proportion of the most common severe chronic diseases of unknown cause, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and schizophrenia (Table 2\n). Because infectious causation of chronic diseases generally cannot be demonstrated with the same level of certainty as infectious causation of acute diseases (eg, Koch's postulates generally cannot be satisfied), acceptance of infectious causation is more protracted for chronic diseases [35]. The evidence for infectious causation of these diseases is steadily mounting and often is making sense of the evidence for genetic and noninfectious environmental causation.",

The \u03b54 allele is maintained at frequencies that range from about 5% to 50% in different human populations. Its frequency is lowest in populations that have been living in high densities for the past few thousand years. The frequency is higher in populations that have been relatively small and isolated during this time, and it is highest in people who have been hunter\u2013gatherers into the 20th century. Even the lowest frequency of the \u03b54 allele is too great to be maintained simply by mutation. The \u03b54 allele is the primary allelic form of the apolipoprotein E gene in other primates and cannot be considered a defective allele. One possible explanation is that the \u03b54 allele increases vulnerability to at least one infectious cause of the \u03b54 allele-associated diseases. Although many pathogens have been associated with these diseases (Table 2), one pathogen, Chlamydia pneumoniae, has been associated with all of them. This finding raises the possibility that the \u03b54 allele increases vulnerability to C pneumoniae infection. As a respiratory-tract pathogen, C pneumoniae undoubtedly inflicts a heavier cost on dense human populations than on sparse populations. If so, the longer that a particular ethnic group has lived in high-density populations, the greater the cumulative selective pressure against the \u03b54 allele. In accordance with this scenario, individuals who are infected with C pneumoniae are about four times as likely to have the \u03b54 allele as are individuals from the general population [37]. C pneumoniae apparently has evolved to take advantage of people who have the \u03b54 allele and has driven down the frequency of \u03b54 allele over time.",

One caveat applies. Pathogens transmitted by sexual oral contact should be selected to be persistent for the same reason that pathogens transmitted by sexual genital contact are selected to be persistent (ie, because sexual oral contact occurs rarely relative to contact through coughing or sneezing). If sexual transmission is defined broadly to include transmission through sexual oral and genital contact, sexually transmitted pathogens over the past quarter century have been responsible for a disproportionately large fraction of the chronic diseases that have been accepted as being caused by infection; about 20% of all human pathogens are sexually transmitted by this definition, but about half of the pathogens that cause these chronic diseases are sexually transmitted (see Table 1). They are also candidate causes of the chronic diseases for which infectious causation strongly is implicated but not yet accepted (see Table 2). To identify infectious causes of chronic diseases, one should look closely at the sexually transmitted pathogens.",
