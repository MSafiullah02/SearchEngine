Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine. canine coronavirus (CCV), and human respiratory-tract coronaviruses of the 229E group together comprise an antigenic cluster of closely-related viruses within the Coronaviridae family (Pedersen, Ward & Mengeling, 1978) . In fact, the major structural polypeptides of FIPV, TGEV, and CCV are so similar antigenically that some regard these three agents as host-range mutants rather than as individual viral species (Horzinek, Lutz & Pedersen, 1982) .",

A potential state of antibody-mediated hypersensitivity thus exists in certain coronavirus antibodypositive cats challenged with FIPV, with this antibody perhaps (1) accelerating the uptake of FIPV (in the form of immune complexes) into reticuloendothelial and polymorphonuclear cells, and (2) promoting widespread destructive inflammatory reactions in blood vessel walls and tissues through immune complex deposition and complement activation (Jacobse-Geels, Daha & Horzinek, 1980 Pedersen & Boyle, 1980; Weiss, Dodds & Scott, 1980; Weiss & Scott, 1981a-c; Hayashi et al., 1983a Hayashi et al., , 1984 .

These feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) can produce a range of effects from asymptomatic infection of the gastrointestinal tract to severe enteritis in kittens and adult cats. The nature of the relationship between FECVs and FIPV is perhaps illuminated by the observation that certain FIPV strains are capable of producing either FIP or enteritis, or both (Hayashi et al., , 1983a . Intestinal lesions can also be produced in newborn pigs by oral inoculation with virulent FIPV (Woods, Cheville & Gallagher, 1981) . It is thus possible that FECVs and FIPV represent pathogenetic (rather than host-range) variants of a single coronavirus typevariants possessing, however, a relatively broad spectrum of virulence from asymptomatic infection to enteritis to lethal, disseminated FIP (Barlough, 1984b) .",

Either FIPV itself or one of the other coronaviruses in the FIPV antigenic cluster (usually TGEV or CCV) can be used as the target antigen in most of these assays. The use of non-FIPV coronaviruses in antibody-testing procedures has become popular in recent years because of long-standing difficulties in routinely propagating FIPV in the laboratory.

This is because serum coronavirus antibody can be found not only in cats with FIP but also in many healthy cats and in many cats with other diseases, indicating that exposure of cats to coronavirus(es) is much more widespread than was once believed. In the general healthy feline population-excluding cats in catteries and multiple-cat householdsapproximately 10 to 40 per cent of cats will have positive coronavirus antibody titres (Note: 'Positive' refers only to the presence of antibody, not to the presence of the FIP disease process). A special situation is encountered when cats are clustered together in catteries, in which case positive titres are either completely absent (i.e., there has been no coronavirus exposure), or are present in 80 to 90 per cent of the cats within a household (indicating efficient spread of virus once it has been introduced). The occurrence of coronavirus antibody in a cattery does not necessarily correlate with its FIP history; e.g., antibody has been found in healthy cats in catteries that have experienced death losses to FIP as well as in catteries that have never lost a cat to FIP.",

Because many cats with undiagnosed illnesses also have elevated titres (indicating previous coronavirus exposure), interpretation of their titres may be difficult. Added complexity has been contributed to interpretation of coronavirus antibody titres in healthy cats and in cats with undiagnosed illnesses by the finding that other coronaviruses (e.g., FECV, and experimentally TEGV and CCV) can also infect cats and generate coronavirus antibodv in their sera. Because these viruses are all serologically cross-reactive with each other and with FIPV, and because several of them are used relatively interchangeably in commercially available coronavirus antibody tests, the non-specificity of these tests is readily apparent. The serodiagnostic potential of these assays (i.e., their ability to identify cats with active FIP and/or potential virus carriers/excretors) is thus limited not only by the widespread distribution of serum coronavirus antibody in the feline population, but also by the possibility that non-FIPV coronaviruses may be responsible for some of the seroconversions that they detect. The actual distribution of antibodies in the general feline population to each of these coronaviruses is therefore unknown, and will remain unknown until highly specific assays capable of differentiating antibody against one coronavirus (e.g. FIPV) from antibody against another (e.g., TGEV) are developed.",

Recent research has shown that antibody against bovine serum components can be found in the serum of certain cats-antibody capable of reacting with antigenically similar bovine serum components present in cell cultures used to propagate target viruses for immunochemical assays such as the IFA, ELISA, and KELA . Because such serum components can adhere tightly to both cells and virus (Johansson, Bergquist & Grandien, 1976; Kraaijeveld, Madge & Macnaughton, 1980; , reactivity against them can be mistaken for a coronavirus antibody response unless feline serum samples are tested in parallel against uninfected cell culture control preparations . One possible explanation for the presence of this reactivity is routine vaccination. Owing to the frequent presence of extraneous cell culture material in many partially purified commercial biologicals, routine parenteral vaccination would seem to provide an ideal opportunity for vaccinees to respond immunologically not only to vaccine virus but also to immunogenic elements of cell culture medium, such as bovine serum proteins (Bonin, Schmidt & Schmidt, 1973; Johansson, Bergquist & Grandien, 1976; Tizard, 1982; Barlough et al., , 1984a Barlough et al., , 1985 Snyder, Eernisse & Erickson, 1983) .

Neither, however, does a positive titre indicate that a cat is protected against FIP, because most cats with FIP also are coronavirus antibody-positive. Considering that FIP occurs only sporadically in the general feline population, and that most cats in FIP-problem households are coronavirus antibody-positive and yet do not contract FIP, it would appear that many cats (perhaps most cats) with coronavirus antibody are protected against the natural disease. The question remains whether it is coronavirus antibody that actually confers this protection or whether unrecognized cellular immunologic factors are involved.
