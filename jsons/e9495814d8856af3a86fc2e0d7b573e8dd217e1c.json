The origin, the protein composition and the function of these structures are not well established. To shed further light on these structures, we have performed a time-course experiment in which the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced membrane rearrangements were examined qualitatively and quantitatively by (immuno)-electron microscopy. With our approach we were able to confirm the appearance of 6, previously reported, membranous structures during the course of a complete infection cycle. These structures include the well-characterized double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), convoluted membranes (CMs) and virions but also the more enigmatic large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), tubular bodies (TBs) and cubic membrane structures (CMSs). We have characterized the LVCVs, TBs and CMSs, and found that the CoVinduced structures appear in a strict order. By combining these data with quantitative analyses on viral RNA, protein synthesis and virion release, this study generates an integrated molecular and ultrastructural overview of CoV infection. In particular, it provides insights in the role of each CoV-induced structure and reveals that LVCVs are ERGIC/Golgi", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "compartments that expand to accommodate an increasing production of viral particles.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Viruses require cellular membranes in one or more steps of their infection cycle for replication, assembly and/or release, and therefore they have developed sophisticated mechanisms to opportunistically rearrange host membranes for their needs.

The presence of DMVs and virions was the obvious morphological changes described at that time. These initial observations have successively been corroborated by numerous studies. More recently, other membranous rearrangements have been described.

A major difficulty in understanding the role of these different structures has been the absence of a quantitative and qualitative EM analyses over time that could help ordering them during the infection cycle.

By combining these qualitative and quantitative data with the measurement of viral RNA synthesis, viral protein production and progeny virus release, we have, for the first time, integrated ultrastructural analyses with molecular information. This approach has allowed us to establish that MHV induces the formation of six membranous rearrangements in the following order: DMVs, CMs, virions, LVCVs, TBs and CMSs. Importantly, we were able to show that most membrane rearrangements (LVCVs, TBs, CMSs and possibly CMs) observed in addition to the key structures in the infection (DMVs and virions) actually appear to be the consequence of a massive synthesis of viral proteins. In particular, LVCVs are ERGIC/Golgi compartments that expand to accommodate an increasing production of virions.

Their amount gradually increased until the 9 h time point, after which the levels remained constant, resulting from a decline in RNA synthesis (Sawicki et al., 2007) . At each time, the amount of sgRNA was about 100-fold higher than that of gRNA. This analysis allowed us to ascertain that the observed changes in the levels of gRNA and sgRNA synthesis are identical to those measured using similar or different assays in various cell lines infected with diverse CoV (Sethna and Brian, 1997; Versteeg et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 479, "end": 501, "text": "(Sawicki et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 803, "end": 827, "text": "(Sethna and Brian, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 828, "end": 850, "text": "Versteeg et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 851, "end": 872, "text": "Sawicki et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 332, "text": "Fig. 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Time-course MHV infection and measurement of CoV life cycle parameters"}, {"text": "Next, we analysed the synthesis of the structural proteins during the infection.

Essentially, identical results were obtained when we analysed the production of the structural proteins S and N in the same way (data not shown). This correlates perfectly with the synthesis kinetics of the sgRNA (Fig. 1A) and consequently indicates that these mRNAs are immediately available for translation.

We identified six different structures. The most abundant of them were large vesicles with an average diameter of 200-350 nm, which are limited by a double-membrane and often were clustered together ( Fig. 2A and B; and Fig. S1A, arrows) . These are the characteristic DMVs induced by CoV (Svoboda et al., 1962; David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Ruebner et al., 1967; Pedersen et al., 1999; Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006; Knoops et al., 2008) . Surprisingly, most of the observed DMVs appeared to have an invagination, which, from time to time, was associated to what looked as a small vesicle with a diameter of 50-100 nm (Fig. S1B, arrow) . This structural peculiarity is cell type-specific because it was also observed in MHV-A59-infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown) but not in mouse LR7 cells (Knoops et al., 2008) . In the centre of the DMV clusters, we frequently observed a small network of membranes with a diameter varying from 200 to 600 nm, which have recently been described in SARS-CoV-infected cells and called CMs [ Fig. 2A and B, arrowheads; (Knoops et al., 2008) . The CMs were often in close proximity of the ER (< 10-20 nm distance), and sometimes appeared to be connected with this organelle (Fig. S1C , arrow). Virions were the third structure that we identified. These dark circular structures with a diameter of 70-110 nm were found in the lumen of either a stack of adjacent cisternae, very likely the Golgi, or what appeared to be secretory vesicles (Fig. 2C ) as well as extracellularly ( Fig. S1D ) in complete agreement with their known assembly and secretion mechanisms. The virions were also observed inside large circular organelles with a diameter of approximately 450-750 nm (Fig. 2D, arrow) . Interestingly, we observed virion particles assembling by invagination at the limiting membrane of these compartments through a process identical to the one occurring at the ERGIC (Fig. 2D, arrow) . Because similar organelles have previously been described (Ng et al., 2003; Goldsmith et al., 2004; Knoops et al., 2008) , we called them in the same way: the LVCVs. The fifth conformation that we detected was a condensed rearrangement of membranes with a diameter of approximately 300-650 nm but without an apparent ultrastructural organization, which seemed to be connected to the ER (Fig. 2E ). These structures have already been described a long time ago and called TBs ( David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) . The sixth classified structure was a rectangular, extended (up to 850 nm in length) and highly organized membranous conformation always continuous to what appeared to be a swollen ER cisterna (Fig. 2F , arrow; the arrowhead indicates the swollen ER).

Their number per cell and their size, however, increased during the progression of the infection reaching a plateau at 7 h p.i. (Fig. 3E ; 4 CM/cell section, 200-600 nm in diameter). A dramatic change in the percentage of CMs was observed at 5 h p.i. when the number of CM positive cells had increased from 2% to 30%. Overall, these data suggested that the CMs are structures that are functionally connected with DMVs as suggested (Knoops et al., 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 779, "end": 800, "text": "(Knoops et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 344, "text": "(Fig. 3D", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 476, "end": 484, "text": "(Fig. 3E", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Quantitative analysis of the appearance of the various MHV-induced structures"}, {"text": "Virions appeared at 5 h p.i. and their intracellular number became constant (8 virions/cell section) already at 6 h p.i., probably upon reaching an equilibrium between synthesis and secretion ( Fig. 3F and G).

LVCVs became detectable at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 3H ) in coincidence with a more than twofold increase in the number of virions per cell profile (Fig. 3I ). This observation suggested that the formation of LVCVs is probably induced by a higher production of virions in the cells. The TBs also became visible at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 3J ). The number of TB-positive cell sections increased during time as well as the size of these structures (Fig. 3K) , with an average diameter of 200-300 nm at 6 h p.i. to one of about 650 nm at 10 h p.i. Initially, each infected cell profile contained only one TB but, after 8 h p.i., we occasionally observed more than one TB per cell section. The CMSs, in contrast, were even more rare (observed in only 1% of the cells) and only detectable after 9 h p.i.; hence a significant statistical analysis could not be performed.

We immunolabelled cryo-sections obtained from cells fixed at 6 and 10 h p.i. to be able to detect compositional changes. However, the labelling profiles at these two infection time points were identical; the only major difference was the higher immunoreactivity of the 10 h p.i. samples due to the higher amounts of viral proteins. As expected (Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006; Stertz et al., 2007) , the nsp2/nsp3, nsp4 and nsp8 proteins were decorating the surface of the DMVs (Fig. 4A-C) . Importantly, we discovered that these nsp's were also present in the CMs but not in the other MHVinduced structures (Fig. 4A -C and Fig. S3A -H). The N protein was also distributed on both DMVs and CMs (Fig. 4D ) suggesting a possible direct relationship between these two structures. Like the two other struc-tural proteins, i.e. M and E, the N protein was found in virions present in the Golgi complex and LVCVs ( Fig. 4E-H) . The M and E proteins were additionally observed in the limiting membrane of the Golgi cisternae but not on other MHV induced membranous rearrangements (Fig. S3) . Interestingly, we discovered that the TBs contain the E protein but are negative for the other tested viral proteins (Fig. 4I, Fig. S3A and C) . This result, plus the fact that the TBs appear at the late stage of the MHV infection ( Fig. 3J and K) , indicates that they could be generated by self-assembly, possibly in the ER, of high levels of E protein.

It has been shown that Golgi cisternae can increase in size in order to accommodate large luminal cargo proteins such as collagen (Bonfanti et al., 1998) . Therefore, we hypothesized that LVCVs are Golgi cisternae that have expanded to increase their capacity to contain a higher number of viral proteins and/or forming virions. To sustain this notion, we first examined if the Golgi changes its organization and subcellular distribution during the course of an MHV infection. We took advantage of the HeLa-GalNAcT2-GFP stable cell line (Storrie et al., 1998) , which expresses the fluorescent Golgi protein marker GalNActT2-GFP, and inoculated these cells with MHV-Srec before analysing them by IF at 0, 8 and 16 h p.i. The presence of viral proteins and virions in the Golgi was assessed using anti-M protein antibodies. In non-infected cells, the Golgi appeared as a juxtanuclear concentration of ribbon-like structures as expected (Fig. 6A , upper panel; Storrie et al., 1998) . The MHV infection caused three major changes, which were already detectable at 8 h p.i. but became more prominent at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 6A, middle and lower panels) . First, the Golgi lost its compact organization; the organelle was scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Second, the intensity of the GalNAcT2-GFP signal in the Golgi decreased. Third, GalNAcT2-GFP appeared to partially localize to the ER. To unravel the effects of MHV infection on the Golgi at the ultrastructural level, the same samples were also processed in parallel for IEM and immunolabelled with anti-GFP antibodies. At 0 h p.i the GalNAcT2-GFP was exclusively concentrated in the Golgi complex, where it distributes into several cisternae (Fig. 6B ). In contrast, at 16 h p.i., the labelling was found onto two different types of structures. The first were fragmented Golgi complexes (Fig. 6C ). This morphological change during an MHV infection phenomenon has previously been reported (Lavi et al., 1996) .

This apparent discrepancy is probably due to various reasons, including the rarity of some of these structures, the examination of a single infection time point and the use of EM procedures lacking high resolution. In our study, we have detected all these types of membrane rearrangements during the course of an MHV infection because we performed a time-course ultrastructural analysis using state-of-the-art EM and IEM procedures. Combining our data with the previous ones, we can assert that SARS-CoV is inducing the same type of structures and therefore we hypothesize that these membrane rearrangements are also formed during infections with other CoV. As a result, the data presented in this study generate a model that could be applicable to all CoV, even if some minor differences could exist. A major difficulty in understanding and studying the role of DMVs, CMs, virions, LVCVs, TBs and CMSs in the CoV life cycle has been the absence of information concerning their appearance and fate in the course of an infection. Another obstacle has also been the very limited characterization of LVCVs, TBs and CMSs but also in part of CMs. Our time-course qualitative and quantitative examination of the MHV infection fills these two gaps (Table 1) , and thus generates a more comprehensive chronological picture of the ultrastructural transformations occurring in the host cells that are induced by this virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 167, "text": "-Caplen et al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 168, "end": 201, "text": "David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 202, "end": 223, "text": "Ruebner et al., 1967;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 224, "end": 247, "text": "Salanueva et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 248, "end": 270, "text": "Escorcia et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 271, "end": 291, "text": "Gosert et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 292, "end": 313, "text": "Snijder et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 314, "end": 334, "text": "Stertz et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 335, "end": 355, "text": "Knoops et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 356, "end": 375, "text": "Banacha et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 458, "end": 482, "text": "(Goldsmith et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 483, "end": 506, "text": "Almsherqi et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 507, "end": 527, "text": "Knoops et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 532, "end": 540, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1794, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "LVCVs are expanded ERGIC/Golgi cisternae"}, {"text": "MHV replication (Fig. 7A) Double-membrane vesicles were the first structure (Knoops et al., 2008 ) that we observed after inoculating the cells with MHV (2 h p.i.; Fig. 3B and C).

Moreover, the RNA levels correlate with the number of DMVs throughout the course of the MHV infection (Fig. S5) . A particularly interesting observation was that the production of RNA reaches a steady-state coincident with a diminution in the generation of DMVs (Fig. 1A, Fig. 3C and D, Fig. S5 ). This observation could support a new concept in which viral RNA synthesis is dictated by the number of DMVs (and thus RTCs) rather than by, or in addition to, the regulation of the rate of RNA replication and transcription.

As already observed (Knoops et al., 2008) , however, the CMs appear after DMV formation ( Fig. 3B and D) . Because of this observation, we favour the idea that CMs are unlikely to be the precursor structure of DMVs. Potentially, they could originate from the DMVs but we never observed continuity between these two structures. Another possibility is that CMs are structures generated either for nsp's storage or by accumulation of excess nsp's that cannot be incorporated into DMVs. The possibility that the DMV biogenesis could require host components makes it possible that depletion of these components causes an accumulation of the newly synthesized transmembrane nsp's in the ER (Harcourt et al., 2004; Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007; Oostra et al., 2007; Oostra et al., 2008) , which leads to a clustering of RTCs at this site that results in the formation of CMs. In accordance with this hypothesis, CMs are frequently connected with the ER (Fig. S1C ; Knoops et al., 2008) . In addition, their size increases over time especially after 7 h p.i. when DMV formation slows down.

In agreement with the previous literature about their formation and release, virions were seen assembling in the ERGIC/Golgi (Fig. 2C) and complete viral particles were present in these organelles but also in secretory vesicles and the extracellular space (Fig. 4G, Fig. 5A, Fig. 6C, Fig. S1D ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 328, "text": "(Vennema et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 329, "end": 355, "text": "de Haan and Rottier, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 28, "end": 37, "text": "(Fig. 7B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 142, "end": 148, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 153, "end": 160, "text": "Fig. S2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 163, "end": 170, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 483, "end": 492, "text": "(Fig. 2C)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 614, "end": 650, "text": "(Fig. 4G, Fig. 5A, Fig. 6C, Fig. S1D", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "While DMVs and complete virions have been observed in cells infected with all CoV studied so far, such as MHV, SARS-CoV, NL63, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Alonso"}, {"text": "These observations were first recorded at 5 h p.i. (Fig. 5F and G). From 6 h p.i., virions were also forming and contained in the LVCVs (Fig. 2D, Fig. 3H and I, Fig. 4E, F and H, Fig. 5B-D, Fig. 6D, Fig. S2A and C, Table 1 ). LVCVs have already been described in SARSinfected cells (Ng et al., 2003; Goldsmith et al., 2004; Knoops et al., 2008) and the observation that viral particles assemble at the limiting membrane of these compartments has led us to hypothesize and to show that they have a Golgi origin (Fig. 5B-D and Fig. 6 ). The enlargement of the ERGIC/Golgi compartments that leads to the formation of the LVCVs is probably a consequence of the accumulation of massive amounts of viral proteins and/or luminal virions that require an expansion of this organelle to accommodate them. This phenomenon has already been reported in the case of large cargo molecules passing through the Golgi (Bonfanti et al., 1998) . It cannot be excluded a priori, however, that an overloading in viral proteins causes a fusion of the Golgi cisternae, which results in the LVCV formation. The fact that the secretory pathway is flooded by viral components is also emphasized by the formation of virions in the ER from 8 h p.i. (Fig. S6) . The labelling efficiency of LVCVs for ERGIC and Golgi protein markers, however, was reduced as compared with that of the same organelles in non-infected cells ( Fig. 6B and Fig. S4B-D) . These observations indicate that some of the standard Golgi functions of this compartment are probably altered by the high content of viral components. This is exemplified by the observation that the Golgi cisternae fragment and the Golgi protein marker GalNAcT2-GFP partially localizes to the ER during the course of an MHV infection ( Fig. 6A and C) . In addition, the secretion of Gaussia luciferase is reduced during MHV infection (Verheije et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, the LVCVs are functional structures because the extracellular release of MHV is still effective at the advanced stages of the MHV infection when numerous LVCVs are present in each cell (Fig. 1C, Fig. 3H and I). LVCVs are probably not an organelle exclusively induced by CoVs, as LVCV-like structures have also been observed in cells infected with the (+) RNA rubellavirus (Risco et al., 2003; Novoa et al., 2005) , which also assembles its progeny virions in association with the Golgi compartment. Our data show that TBs and CMSs are infrequent structures ( Fig. 3J and data not shown), that they appear at the late stages of the CoV infection ( Fig. 3J and K, and data not shown) and that they probably contain a single viral protein (Fig. 4I, Table 1 ). These observations indicate that they are the result of the massive production of viral proteins that cannot be incorporated into the virions (Fig. 7B ). The TBs are only positive for the E protein but not for the nsp's, the N and the M protein ( Fig. S2D -E, Fig. S3A and C; Table 1 ). We cannot formally exclude that they also contain the S protein but it is unlikely because the individual expression of the E protein is sufficient to induce the formation of a complex of smooth tubular membranes with morphology reminiscent to that of the TBs (Raamsman et al., 2000) . The E protein is a transmembrane component that is inserted in the ER before being transported to the ERGIC/Golgi (Lim and Liu, 2001; Corse and Machamer, 2003 ) that is also able to selfinteract (Raamsman et al., 2000; Von brunn et al., 2007) . Importantly, even if not positive for the ER resident chaperone PDI, the TBs have clear membrane continuity with the ER (Fig. 2E, Fig. 5E, Fig. S2D and F) . Consequently, a very likely scenario is that the TBs are generated by excess E protein that self-aggregates in the ER. The CMSs were negative for any of the tested viral proteins ( Fig. S2G and H, Fig. S3D and F, Table 1 ), and therefore we speculate that they are induced by the S protein, for which we do not have an antibody compatible with our IEM procedure. The CMSs are clearly connected with ER and positive for PDI ( Fig. 2F and Fig. 5F ). Interestingly, it has previously been shown that overexpression of transmembrane proteins that have the capacity to self-interact can lead to the formation of geometrical and crystalloid conformations in the ER that have been called either 'cubic membranes' or 'organised smooth ER', which resemble the CMSs (Snapp et al., 2003; Almsherqi et al., 2006; . Therefore, the simplest model that we propose is that CMSs are formed by the self-assembly of excess S protein in the ER.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 299, "text": "(Ng et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 300, "end": 323, "text": "Goldsmith et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 324, "end": 344, "text": "Knoops et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 900, "end": 923, "text": "(Bonfanti et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1854, "end": 1877, "text": "(Verheije et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2286, "text": "(Risco et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2306, "text": "Novoa et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3198, "end": 3221, "text": "(Raamsman et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3338, "end": 3357, "text": "(Lim and Liu, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3358, "end": 3382, "text": "Corse and Machamer, 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3419, "end": 3442, "text": "(Raamsman et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3443, "end": 3466, "text": "Von brunn et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 4382, "end": 4402, "text": "(Snapp et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 4403, "end": 4426, "text": "Almsherqi et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 59, "text": "(Fig. 5F", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 136, "end": 153, "text": "(Fig. 2D, Fig. 3H", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 161, "end": 207, "text": "Fig. 4E, F and H, Fig. 5B-D, Fig. 6D, Fig. S2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 215, "end": 222, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 510, "end": 531, "text": "(Fig. 5B-D and Fig. 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1229, "text": "(Fig. S6)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1400, "text": "Fig. 6B", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1416, "text": "Fig. S4B-D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1770, "text": "Fig. 6A and C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2096, "text": "(Fig. 1C, Fig. 3H", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2460, "text": "Fig. 3J", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2548, "text": "Fig. 3J", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2647, "text": "(Fig. 4I, Table 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2793, "end": 2801, "text": "(Fig. 7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 2898, "end": 2906, "text": "Fig. S2D", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2911, "end": 2919, "text": "Fig. S3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2934, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 3589, "end": 3623, "text": "(Fig. 2E, Fig. 5E, Fig. S2D and F)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 3807, "end": 3831, "text": "Fig. S2G and H, Fig. S3D", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3839, "end": 3846, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 4051, "end": 4070, "text": "Fig. 2F and Fig. 5F", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "While DMVs and complete virions have been observed in cells infected with all CoV studied so far, such as MHV, SARS-CoV, NL63, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Alonso"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study has ordered and characterized the different membranous rearrangements induced during a CoV infection.
