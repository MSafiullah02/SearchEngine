It has caused outbreak infections in Hong Kong and worldwide [2, 3, 4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has revised the case fatality ratio from the previous experience in Vietnam of 8% to that of 15% in Hong Kong on 7 May 2003 [5]. Influencing these mean fatality rates, there is a disproportional increase for patients aged 65 or older, many with co\u2010morbidity [2]. Therefore, age itself can no doubt function as an independent risk factor for fatality. However, there is no information about other biochemical and immunological markers for helping clinicians to predict adverse clinical outcomes other than serum total lactate dehydrogenase (LD) activity alone [2]. Blood leucocytes and lymphocyte subsets were reported to decrease, respectively, in 47% and up to 100% of a 38\u2010patient cohort in Beijing [6]. However, their prognostic implications have not been thoroughly investigated. This study was conducted to assess the prognostic values of these parameters in SARS.",

This prompted us to further investigate the prognostic significance of LD isoenzymes in the present study. LD is a cytoplasmic zinc\u2010containing enzyme of ubiquitous tissue distribution in mammalian species. The human LD is a tetramer that has a molecular weight of about 140 kDa. For such a sizeable molecule to be released into the extracellular fluid through the cytoplasmic membrane, it must be due either to normal cellular turnover such as apoptosis, or tissue destruction such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Five LD isoenzymes can be found in human serum: LD1\u2013LD5 of different tissue predominance [14]. In the myocardium, LD1 contributes to about 60% of the total LD activity; in blood erythrocytes, the contribution is about 40% [14]. These are the two major sources of LD1 found in human serum. In SARS\u2010associated elevation of serum total LD activity, we found LD1 to be the major contributor compared with other LD isoenzymes as evidenced by its high prognostic value in predicting death.",

In contrast to SARS, there exists no previous report on massive tissue destruction or increase in serum LD activity in H5N1 influenza A virus infection, although both infections cause lymphopenia [2, 18]. The latter absence of massive tissue destruction could be accounted by tissue tropism of the avian flu virus towards lung parenchyma predominantly [19] with diminished cytokine production [20].",

However, as LD1 is abundantly distributed in erythrocytes, the haemolytic effect of ribavirin [21] cannot be excluded as another possible cause. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated online on 13 May 2003 that preliminary in vitro experiments had suggested that ribavirin did not inhibit growth or cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread of the new coronavirus tested [22]. However, at the time of SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, there was no other known effective antiviral agent against the SARS\u2010CoV. It was definitely unethical to withhold the only antiviral treatment available with the requirement of using continuous and massive pulse corticosteroid therapy at the same time. Later, Knowles et al. reported that the use of high\u2010dose ribavirin was associated with significant haemolytic anaemia and prolonged hospital stay in a case\u2013control study [23]. The efficacy and toxicity of ribavirin therapy against SARS requires further elucidation with randomized clinical trials.",

They represent lymphocyte sub\u2010populations, namely, total (CD3+), T\u2010helper (CD4+) and cytotoxic T (CD8+) lymphocytes, as well as natural killer (CD56+) cells that are much involved in the development of humoral and cytotoxic immunity against viral infection. A marked reduction in their absolute counts could possibly be due to direct viral cytotoxicity. After steroid therapy, these immunological markers started to rise from their trough values [24]. The suppressed CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cell counts may be implicated in the pathophysiology of SARS. In acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), only a selected population of T\u2010lymphocytes (T\u2010helper cells) is attacked and destroyed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There exist published recommendations on the measurement of CD4+ cell counts by CDC to monitor the disease course and therapeutic efficacy for HIV infection and AIDS [25]. During the initial outbreak of SARS in PWH, we encountered difficulty in the allocation of limited number of ICU beds because SARS patients requiring ICU care could be as high as 20% [26]. Therefore, measurement of the above immunological markers should be useful in the planning and management of SARS patients, in particular, the estimation of ICU bed requirement.",

Its release could possibly be from blood erythrocytes and body tissues other than the myocardium. Routine monitoring of serum LD1 is as simple as total LD assay. Close monitoring of SARS patients using serum LD1 should be performed to ensure prompt management. Blood CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and natural killer cell counts were found to be good prognostic indicators for predicting admission to ICU in patients with SARS compared with age, leucocyte count and LD isoenzymes. The suppressed CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and natural killer cell counts were also implicated in the pathophysiology of SARS. Preparation for admission to ICU could be planned ahead for patients with suppressed lymphocyte subsets.",
