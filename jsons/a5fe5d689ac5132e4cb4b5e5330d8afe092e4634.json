The roles of a dozen host factors involved in various steps of the replication process have been validated in yeast as well as a plant host. Altogether, the large number of host factors identified and the great variety of cellular functions performed by these factors indicate the existence of a truly complex interaction between TBSV and the host cell. This review summarizes the advantages of using a simple plant virus and yeast as a model host to advance our understanding of virus-host interactions at the molecular and cellular levels. The knowledge of host factors gained can potentially be used to inhibit virus replication via gene silencing, expression of dominant negative mutants, or design of specific chemical inhibitors leading to novel specific or broad-range resistance and antiviral tools against (\u00fe)RNA plant viruses.",

(\u00fe)RNA viruses have limited coding potential with usually 4-10 genes, yet they can replicate efficiently in the infected host cells. They accomplish this feat by recruiting an unknown number of host factors, such as host proteins, membranes, and ribonucleotides for their replication that can produce thousands to millions of progeny viral RNAs per cell in 24 h. The virus can trick the recruited host factors to perform novel functions that are frequently targeted against the host cells. (\u00fe)RNA viruses can also induce strong responses of the infected host cells leading to the activation of the innate immune responses. Altogether, the (\u00fe)RNA virus infected cells go through major changes during the infection process. Many of the original cellular processes/pathways are getting reprogrammed by the infecting virus and these changes make the cells dramatically different from the uninfected cells. The outcome of the virus infection often resembles to the chaotic situation and destruction caused by having two opposing armies fighting a well-planned out, but expensive war for gaining full control over the same country.",

These proteins then facilitate the rescue of the viral RNA from translation and the viral RNA is selected/ recruited for replication. This is followed by the assembly of the viral replicase on subcellular membrane surfaces. The assembled replicase complex produces complementary minus-strand (\u00c0)RNA using the original (\u00fe)RNA as a template. Then, the minus-stranded RNA intermediate is used by the viral replicase to synthesize excess amount of new (\u00fe)RNA progeny, which is released from the site of replication to the cytosol and/or become encapsidated to form new viral particles Panavas et al., 2005a) . One of the amazing things about (\u00fe)RNA viruses is that they complete an infection cycle within 6-24 h in the primary infected cells. Thus, (\u00fe)RNA virus infection is often a fast race between the parasite and the host to gain control over the resources of the host cell.",

            "text": "B. Selection of the viral RNA template for replication and the recruitment of the replication proteins to the subcellular sites of replication Viral (\u00fe)RNA replication takes place on the cytosolic surfaces of intracellular membranes, where the viral RNA and replication proteins, together with co-opted host factors, are sequestered and reach high local concentrations that facilitate robust replication. Many RNA viruses are known to form spherules (small membrane invaginations) with small openings towards to the cytosol ( Fig. 1 ) (Kopek et al., 2007; Schwartz et al., 2002) . These spherules are the sites of RNA replication and frequently connected with the sites of virus assembly (Ahlquist, 2006) . But how are these spherules formed and what is the role of the co-opted host factors? Although we do not yet know the answers to these fascinating questions, it is likely that efficient recruitment of all the viral and host factors are critical for replication. The selection of the viral (\u00fe)RNA for replication is thought to be mediated by a viral-coded protein binding selectively to a specific sequence/structure in the viral (\u00fe)RNA. For example, the Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) p33 auxiliary replication protein recognizes a C\u00c1 C mismatch within an extended hairpin in the viral RNA (Monkewich et al., 2005; Pogany et al., 2005) . The Brome mosaic virus (BMV) 1a helicase-like protein binds to the subgenomic promoter region in RNA3 to facilitate the selection of the RNA for replication . The flock house virus (FHV) protein A replication protein specifically recognizes the 5 0 sequence in the RNA facilitating its recruitment to the mitochondrial outer membrane (Van Wynsberghe and Ahlquist, 2009) . In spite of these advances in our understanding of the template selection process, we do not yet know how the translating ribosomes are removed from the (\u00fe)RNA templates selected for replication. Models have been proposed that viral replication proteins or host factors, such as Lsm proteins, promote the switch of the RNA from translation to replication (Beckham et al., 2007) . The CNV-induced spherules in the center of the image and the assembled large number of virions in plant cells are depicted with arrows. Note that the entire cytosol of the portion of the cell shown is completely filled by CNV virions, demonstrating robust CNV replication. Magnification is 49,000\u00c2. (B) Several characteristic CNV-induced spherules are marked with arrowheads on the EM images. These 50-80 nm spherules are formed via membrane invagination into peroxisomal or ER-derived membranes. Narrow openings (necks) are visible likely connecting the spherules to the cytosol. Control samples lacking CNV do not show similar structures (not shown). Magnification is 98,000\u00c2. The images were taken by Dr. Barajas. Targets to Induce Resistance Against Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus Another important step is the recruitment of the viral (\u00fe)RNA and the viral replication proteins together with co-opted host proteins to the sites of replication. The viral (\u00fe)RNA likely travels together with the viral proteins as an RNP complex. The targeting of key viral proteins in the cells is guided by signal sequences present in the replication proteins. Other viral proteins, such as the viral RdRp protein, and co-opted host factors might be ''piggy-backing'' on the targeted viral protein to reach the destination of the subcellular membranes.",

The viral replicase consists of viralcoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), viral auxiliary replication proteins, the subcellular membrane, and co-opted host proteins. Among these factors, the contribution of host factors to the viral replication process is the least understood. The host factors likely complement the functions of the viral replication proteins to regulate RNA replication. Moreover, the host components in the replicase complex likely provide protection from host cellular ribonucleases, including the powerful gene silencing machinery, as well as they might be involved in delaying the recognition of viral components by the host surveillance system. The host factors are also likely responsible for activation of RdRps of several (\u00fe)RNA viruses, such as p92 pol of TBSV, 2a pol of BMV, P2 of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), 180K of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B. These viral RdRps become activated only after the assembly of the viral replicase in membranous spherules or vesicles (Panaviene et al., 2004 Quadt et al., 1995; Vlot et al., 2001) . Although the role of host factors during the assembly of the replicase and the activation of RdRp is currently unknown, they likely work together with the viral RNA as well, which also plays a key role in these processes.",

RNA synthesis by the viral replicase is a two-step process (\u00fe)RNA virus replication occurs within membrane-bound structures and is performed by the viral replicase complex using the recruited (\u00fe)RNA as the template . The viral RNA contains specific cisacting elements, including promoters, silencers, and enhancers, which regulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and the efficiency of replication (Dreher, 1999; Kao et al., 2001; Nagy and Pogany, 2006; White and Nagy, 2004; Wu et al., 2009) . Interestingly, the (\u00c0)RNA produced on the (\u00fe)RNA template is the more efficient template, resulting in 20-100-fold more (\u00fe)RNA progeny than the amount of (\u00c0)RNA intermediate. It is currently thought that the (\u00c0)RNA is always present in the replicase complex and never gets released from the site of replication, whereas the majority of (\u00fe)RNA progeny is released to the cytosol or assembled into viral particles (Panavas et al., 2005a) .

The gRNA codes for two replication proteins, termed p33 and p92 pol , and produces two subgenomic RNAs for the expression of three viral proteins involved in cell-to-cell movement, encapsidation, and suppression of gene silencing White and Nagy, 2004) . Recent advances with tombusviruses have been accelerated by the development of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model host to study TBSV replication and recombination (Nagy, 2008; Panavas and Nagy, 2003) . Yeast expressing p33 and p92 pol replication proteins can efficiently replicate a short TBSV-derived replicon (rep)RNA (Panavas and Nagy, 2003; Panaviene et al., 2004) . Importantly, replication of the TBSV repRNA in yeast depends on the same cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting p33/p92 replication proteins as in plants (Nagy, 2008; Panavas and Nagy, 2003) . The DI-72 repRNA, which is derived naturally from TBSV infections of plants, does not encode proteins and it can replicate efficiently in yeast cells without maintaining an artificial selection pressure. Moreover, the tombusvirus repRNA plays several functions, including serving as a template for replication and as a platform for the assembly of the viral replicase complex Panaviene et al., 2005; Pogany et al., 2005) . The viral RNA also participates in RNA recombination (Serviene et al., 2005; White and Morris, 1994; White and Nagy, 2004) , which likely plays a major role in virus evolution. Altogether, the development of yeast as a model host for TBSV facilitated the application of the available genomics and proteomics tools to identify host components required or affecting TBSV replication and virus-host interactions Li et al., 2008 Li et al., , 2009 Nagy, 2008; Nagy and Pogany, 2006; Panavas et al., 2005b; Serva and Nagy, 2006; Serviene et al., 2005 Serviene et al., , 2006 .

The advantage of the YKO library is that the strains are well defined and they lack the expression of the given gene, unlike the siRNA-based screens, where the expression of the particular gene is only knocked down. The repeatability of siRNA screens also depends on the level of knockdown, which could be influenced by several factors/parameters of the experiments. The disadvantage of the use of the YKO library or other mutant libraries is the significant gene redundancy in biological systems. Namely, many genes have two or more homologous copies, like the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), which can efficiently complement each other, leading to false negatives during the screens. Also, many proteins have pleiotropic effects in cells, affecting the functions of several other proteins and pathways. These host proteins might contribute indirectly to virus replication. Therefore, usually it is not yet known at the end of the genome-wide screens if the identified host genes affect virus replication directly or indirectly.",

Grouping of the identified host genes based on their known cellular functions revealed that TBSV replication depends on a wide variety of gene functions belonging to 11 different groups. These include five genes involved in protein biosynthesis by either being part of the ribosome or acting as a translation elongation factor. The other groups are involved in protein metabolism, such as ubiquitination pathway and posttranslational modification (eight genes), RNA metabolism (five genes), and in lipid metabolism (five genes). A large group includes 20 genes implicated in vesicle-mediated transport, affecting endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, vacuole transport, or membrane fusion. Additional groups include membrane-associated proteins (seven genes) or stress responsive genes (five genes) or have variable functions in general metabolism (11 genes).

Therefore, proteome-wide screens based on proteomics approaches are needed to identify all the host factors interacting with selected viral proteins or to determine what molecular networks and cellular pathways are affected by the viral proteins. One major advantage of proteomics approaches in general is that they are not limited by gene redundancy. Therefore, proteomics can efficiently complement the above genomics approaches to identify host factors affecting (\u00fe)RNA replication. Another advantage is that direct protein interaction networks can be established. The disadvantages of many proteomics approaches are that the abundance of a particular protein in the cell could be a critical factor, since low abundance proteins are more difficult to identify in biological samples than high abundance proteins. On the contrary, low or high expression level for a given protein is a lesser concern in the above genomics screens with gene deletions or Targets to Induce Resistance Against Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus downregulation of mRNA transcripts/protein levels.

The recruited host proteins could be part of the replicase complex to aid viral replication. Moreover, the interacting host proteins might facilitate the transport of viral proteins in the cells or affect the assembly of the viral replicase as well as provide regulatory functions during viral replication. To catalogue the list of host proteins interacting with the viral replication proteins, we have taken a proteome-wide approach with the yeast protein array carrying $ 4100 purified proteins that covers $ 70% of yeast proteins (Fig. 2 ). This has led to the identification of 57 proteins binding to p33, whereas an additional 11 host proteins bound only to the unique portion of p92, but not to p33. Among the identified host proteins interacting with p33, there are three protein chaperones (Gim3p, Jjj1p, and Jjj3p), five proteins involved in protein ubiquitination (Cdc34p, Rsp5p, Uba1p, Ubp10p, and Ubp15p), six translation factors involved in mRNA translation (Bfr1p, Efb1p, Hbs1p, Rpl8Ap, Tif1p, and Tif11p), and 10 proteins involved in RNA processing and metabolism (Ala1p, Bud21p, Erb1, Rib2p, Sas10p, Stm1p, Trm1p, Trz1p, Tsr2p, and Urn1p). The remaining list of identified host proteins are involved in various cellular processes and the functions of nine proteins are not yet defined. The 11 host proteins bound only to p92 includes an RNA helicase (Dpb3p), a methylase (Dot1p), an aminopeptidase (Map1p), an RNA-binding protein (Npl3p), and a translation factor (eEF1A/Tef2p).",

The large number of factors identified and the great variety of cellular function for these factors (Fig. 4) indicate the existence of a truly complex interaction between a simple (\u00fe)RNA virus and the yeast model host. This complexity might be due to several levels of interaction taking place between the virus and the host. For example, it is possible that many recruited host factors play a direct, well-defined function for promoting virus replication; others could inhibit TBSV accumulation, while many more host proteins might have only indirect roles in TBSV replication by affecting the general metabolisms/pathways in the cells that also influence virus replication. Many of the identified host factors could be part of protein networks and pathways that are recruited in an orchestrated way for virus replication, while other factors might be recruited and function individually. Another complication is that virus replication might utilize either the known function or an unknown function of a given host factor or even multiple functions of the same protein. Moreover, some host factors might perform completely novel functions (not performed during regular cellular processes) during virus replication. Detailed further analysis of the identified host factors based on bioinformatics in combination with biochemical, genetic, and cellular analyses will be needed to dissect the functions of the host proteins during TBSV replication. These are enormous challenges waiting for virology research to uncover the mechanism of (\u00fe)RNA virus replication in order to understand virus-host interaction.

Mutational analysis of eEF1A suggests that it might be involved in promoting (\u00c0)RNA synthesis by the replicase complex (Z. Li and P.D. Nagy, unpublished data) . Another function of eEF1A is to stabilize the p33 replication protein, while it did not affect the half-life of the less abundant p92 pol replication protein in yeast (Li et al., 2009) . Interestingly, a prokaryotic homolog of eEF1A, called Tu translation elongation factor, plays a role in replication of bacteriophage Qb (Blumenthal et al., 1976) . In addition, eEF1A was found to bind to many viral (\u00fe)RNAs, including the 3 0 -UTR of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) (Dreher, 1999) , of West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Turnip mosaic virus (De Nova-Ocampo et al., 2002; Nishikiori et al., 2006; Thivierge et al., 2008; Zeenko et al., 2002) . In addition, eEF1A has also been shown to interact with the NS5A replication protein of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Johnson et al., 2001) , NS4A of HCV (Kou et al., 2006) , the TMV replicase (Yamaji et al., 2006) , and the Gag polyprotein of HIV-1 (Cimarelli and Luban, 1999) . The biochemical functions provided by eEF1A for (\u00fe) RNA virus replication are currently poorly understood. It has been proposed to affect minus-strand synthesis for WNV (Davis et al., 2007) , albeit it repressed minus-strand synthesis of TYMV in vitro (Dreher, 1999; Dreher et al., 1999; Matsuda et al., 2004) . Overall, the interaction of eEF1A with viral RNAs and viral replication proteins and its high abundance in cells might facilitate recruitment of eEF1A into virus replication.",

Since the phosphorylated form of p33 lost its ability to bind to (\u00fe)rep RNA and in vitro phosphorylation of the p33: repRNA complex led to the release of the RNA from the complex, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of p33 and possibly p92, which carries the same p33 sequence at its N-terminus due to its overlapping ORF, might lead to the release of the viral RNA from the replicase complex .",

Interestingly, a Cdc34p mutant inactive in ubiquitin conjugation could not complement the reduced amount of wt Cdc34p based on the activity of the isolated tombusvirus replicase , suggesting that the ubiquitination activity of Cdc34p is critical for TBSV replication. However, the actual function of Cdc34p within the replicase complex is not yet known. Rsp5p E3 ubiquitin ligase has been shown to bind to p33 and p92 pol replication proteins and it can ubiquitinate p33 in the presence of E1 and E2 proteins in vitro (Barajas et al., 2009b) . However, unlike Cdc34p, Rsp5p inhibits TBSV replication by binding via its three WW repeats to p92 pol and destabilizing p92 pol and reducing the replicase activity (Fig. 5) . Surprisingly, the HECT domain involved in protein ubiquitination is not required for the inhibitory activity of Rsp5p (Barajas et al., 2009b) . Future experiments should address what is the role of Rsp5p in regulation of TBSV replication.",

Nsr1p binds to the upstream portion of the 3 0 -UTR, known as RIII in DI-72 (\u00fe)RNA (Jiang et al., 2010) . The binding of Nsr1p to RIII(\u00fe) is relevant since the inhibitory effect of Nsr1p on DI-72 repRNA accumulation in vivo was lost when DI-72 repRNA lacked RIII sequence. Regulated overexpression of Nsr1p revealed that Nsr1p must be present at the beginning of viral replication for efficient inhibition. Moreover, the purified recombinant Nsr1p inhibited the in vitro replication of the viral RNA in a yeast cell-free assay only when preincubated with the viral RNA before the in vitro replication assay (Jiang et al., 2010) . These data suggest that Nsr1p likely inhibits an early step, such as RNA recruitment, in the replication process. We propose that Nsr1p may inhibit TBSV replication via specific binding to the viral RNA and, thus, resulting in inefficient viral RNA recruitment for replication.",

Xrn1p inhibits tombusvirus replication and might be a component of the host innate immunity. Xrn1p is a major enzyme in the RNA degradation pathway in yeast (Johnson, 1997; Sheth and Parker, 2003) . Xrn1p is involved in degradation of tombusvirus RNA, including partially degraded viral RNAs generated by endoribonucleases (Cheng et al., , 2007 Jaag and Nagy, 2009 ). In the absence of Xrn1p/Xrn4p, accumulation of tombusvirus RNA increased several fold as well as novel viral recombinant RNAs emerged rapidly in yeast and in plants. Moreover, based on a yeast cell-free TBSV replication assay, which supports authentic replication and recombination of TBSV, it has been shown that the purified recombinant Xrn1p efficiently inhibited the accumulation of recombinants and partly degraded viral RNAs. Altogether, the data from yeast and plant hosts and a cell-free assay confirmed a central role for the cytosolic 5 0 -3 0 exoribonuclease in TBSV replication, recombination and viral RNA degradation (Cheng et al., , 2007 Jaag and Nagy, 2009 ).",

Sterols are ubiquitous and essential membrane components in all eukaryotes, affecting membrane rigidity, fluidity and permeability by interacting with other lipids and proteins within the membranes (Bloch, 1983 (Bloch, , 1992 . Sterols are important for the organization of detergent-resistant lipid rafts (Roche et al., 2008) . Erg25p in yeast and the orthologous SMO1 (sterol-4a-methyl-oxidase) and SMO2 in plants perform the removal of two methyl groups at C4 position, which is critical and rate limiting during sterol synthesis (Darnet and Rahier, 2004) . Indeed, sterol molecules become functional structural components of membranes only after the removal of the two methyl groups at C 4 . Downregulation or pharmacological inhibition of ERG25 in yeast led to four-to fivefold decreased TBSV RNA accumulation (Sharma et al., 2010) . Among the functions provided by sterols during tombusvirus replication, two roles for sterols have been identified. The first function is to facilitate the assembly of the viral replicase complex based on the reduced in vitro activity of the tombusvirus replicase when isolated from yeast cells with reduced level of sterols. The second function is related to the stability of p92 pol viral replication protein, which showed approximately threefold reduced half-life when expressed in yeast treated with a chemical inhibitor of ERG25. The bulky p92 pol replicase protein might be exposed to cytosolic proteases in sterol-poor microenvironment. Alternatively, the structure of p92 pol is different under sterol-depleted condition, leading to premature degradation of p92 pol . Moreover, the subcellular localization of p92 pol could be different if less than normal level of sterols was available in cells.",

Intriguingly, the ubiquitinated TBSV p33 replication protein was found to interact with Vps23p ESCRT-I and Bro1p accessory ESCRT factors (Barajas et al., 2009a) . The interaction has been shown to lead to the recruitment of Vps23p and possibly Bro1p to the peroxisomes, the sites of TBSV replication. This is followed by the recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins, Snf7p and Vps24p, which could help the optimal assembly of the replicase complex, facilitate the grouping of p33/p92 molecules together in the membrane and/or promote the formation of viral spherules by deforming the membrane (membrane invagination). Then, Doa4p deubiquitination enzyme is predicted to remove ubiquitin from the ubiquitinated p33, while Vps4p ATPase likely recycles the ESCRT proteins from the replicase complex at the end of the assembly (Barajas et al., 2009a) .",

Moreover, the minusstranded viral RNA in the replicase from vps23D or vps24D yeast became more accessible to ribonuclease, suggesting that the protection of the viral RNA is compromised within the replicase complex assembled in the absence of ESCRT proteins. Thus, the role of ESCRT proteins seems to control the quality of the replicase complex assembly, making the viral RNAs within replicase complex well protected from ribonucleases. Based on these observations, we propose that ESCRT proteins help tombusviruses hide from host defense recognition and avoid the attack by the host defense machinery during viral replication. Similar role for ESCRT proteins or other host factors might help other (\u00fe)RNA viruses, which are also known to deform membranes and form spherules during replication.",

Expression of separationof-function mutants of Pmr1p revealed that the ability of Pmr1p to control the Mn 2\u00fe concentration in the cytosol is a key factor in viral RNA recombination. Based on the known cellular function of Pmr1p and in vitro and in vivo TBSV recombination assays, it has been proposed that the Pmr1p Ca 2\u00fe /Mn 2\u00fe ion pump regulates TBSV RNA recombination by keeping the Mn 2\u00fe concentration low in the cytosol (Jaag et al., 2010) . When Mn 2\u00fe concentration is low in the cell, then the RdRp within the viral replicase utilizes the far more abundant Mg 2\u00fe over Mn 2\u00fe , leading to low-frequency RNA recombination. On the other hand, deletion/inhibition of the Pmr1p Ca 2\u00fe /Mn 2\u00fe pump leads to an increased level of cytosolic Mn 2\u00fe (Mandal et al., 2000) , promoting the more efficient use of Mn 2\u00fe by the viral RdRp, which leads to high-frequency RNA recombination. Thus, Pmr1p activity in the cell affects TBSV RNA replication and recombination through Targets to Induce Resistance Against Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus regulating the cytosolic Mn 2\u00fe level (Jaag et al., 2010) . Overall, the emerging picture from the genome-wide studies and the more detailed studies on PMR1 is that complex interactions between TBSV and its host affect not only TBSV replication, but viral adaptation and evolution as well.",

            "text": "The tombusvirus replicase complex contains Hsp70, an abundant cytosolic chaperone, which is required for TBSV replication Serva and Nagy, 2006) . The interaction between Hsp70 and the tombusvirus replication proteins occurs in the functional replicase (Fig. 3) , since affinity purification of Ssa1p from the solubilized membrane fraction of yeast resulted in copurification of tombusvirus replicase activity (Wang et al., 2009b) . Hsp70 chaperone seems to play multiple and essential roles during TBSV replication (Fig. 5 ). For example, using a temperature-sensitive mutant of Hsp70 at nonpermissive temperature has led to cytosolic localization of p33 replication protein (Wang et al., 2009a) . Shifting down from nonpermissive to permissive temperature resulted in relocalization of p33 to the peroxisome membrane surface in yeast. Subcellular fractionation experiments have shown that the viral replication proteins are mostly cytosolic in ssa1ssa2 yeast at the early time point (Wang et al., 2009b) . Interestingly, the viral proteins become partly membrane-bound at a latter time point likely due to partial complementation by the cytosolic, stress-inducible Ssa3p and Ssa4p, which operate at higher levels in ssa1ssa2 cells (Becker et al., 1996; Werner-Washburne et al., 1987) . This suggests that Hsp70 is involved in localization/transportation of the viral replication proteins. It has been proposed that the binding of p33 and p92 pol replication proteins to Hsp70 results in shielding the hydrophobic transmembrane domains in the replication protein that could prevent their aggregation and promote binding to Pex19p transport protein (see below). The latter interaction is needed for peroxisomal targeting of the replication proteins (Pathak et al., 2008) .",

Indeed, it has recently been shown that the host shuttle protein Pex19p, which is involved in peroxisomal membrane protein transport, plays a role in TBSV protein transportation to the site of replication (Fig. 5 ) (Pathak et al., 2008) . Pex19p not only binds to the peroxisomal targeting signals in p33 in vitro, but also it is temporarily associated with the replicase complex. When Pex19p was mistargeted to mitochondrial membranes, the wt p33 was also colocalized to the same mitochondrial membranes (Pathak et al., 2008) . However, the role of Pex19p is not essential for TBSV replication since TBSV repRNA replicated as efficiently in pex19D yeast defective in peroxisome biogenesis as in the wt yeast Panavas et al., 2005b) . Indeed, confocal microscopy-based approach revealed that the wt tombusvirus p33 replication protein accumulated in the ER in pex3D or pex19D yeast lacking peroxisomes, suggesting that tombusvirus replication could occur on the surface of the ER membrane. Moreover, the activity of the isolated tombusvirus replicase from wt, pex3D, or pex19D yeasts was comparable, indicating that the assembly of the replicase was as efficient in the ER as in the authentic subcellular environment . Overall, these data demonstrated that TBSV, relying on the wt replication proteins, could efficiently replicate on an alternative intracellular membrane. Thus, RNA viruses might have remarkable flexibility for using various host membranes for their replication. It is currently not known how many other host proteins, similar to Pex19p, have been ''missed'' in the previous screens. Performing additional genome-wide screens will tell us if we are getting closer to identification of all host factors affecting TBSV replication and recombination at the cellular level.",

A small and simple eukaryotic cell, such as yeast, likely can provide most host factors needed for virus replication as demonstrated in case of TBSV (Nagy, 2008 ). Yet, it is important to demonstrate the relevance of the host factors identified in yeast in a natural plant host as well. The validation of the identified yeast factors has now been done for a growing number of host genes as discussed below. Moreover, the gained knowledge on these host factors can be used to interfere with their functions during TBSV replication, resulting in induction of resistance or development of antiviral treatments. Knocking down the expression level of the plant NbGAPDH, the ortholog of yeast TDH1 and TDH2 genes, in Nicotiana benthamiana host led to 85-90% reduction in TBSV and Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV, another tombusvirus) genomic RNA accumulation (Wang and Nagy, 2008) . Importantly, the GAPDH-silenced plants showed resistance against tombusviruses, indicating that this approach could lead to a new antiviral approach. The same strategy did not interfere with the accumulation of an unrelated plant RNA virus (i.e., TMV), which could be due to the lack of function for GAPDH in TMV replication. This is not surprising since TMV is more similar to BMV than to TBSV and it has been shown previously that TBSV is affected by a vastly different set of host factors as BMV Panavas et al., 2005b) .",

Accordingly, Hsp70 was shown to be part of the CNV and TMV replicase complexes (Nishikiori et al., 2006; Serva and Nagy, 2006) . Altogether, the chemical inhibition of Hsp70 functions in plant hosts could be a broad antiviral approach.",

These data strongly support the role of sterols and host membranes in tombusvirus replication in plants as well (Sharma et al., 2010) . Moreover, using chlorpromazine (CPZ) to alter membrane properties of the host cells led to strong Targets to Induce Resistance Against Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus inhibition of TBSV accumulation in plants .

The roles of several of these host genes in TBSV replication and recombination have been validated. However, one of the surprising observations is that the genome-wide screens led to the identification of mostly unique host factors that were not identified in other genome-wide screens. It is possible that many genes involved in TBSV repRNA replication and recombination are functionally redundant. Indeed, the host proteins that were identified in the highly purified functional tombusvirus replicase complex (such as Hsp70, GAPDH, and eEF1A) are coded by two or more genes in the yeast genome. This functional redundancy in host genes justifies the need for additional genome-or proteome-wide approaches in the identification of host genes affecting TBSV replication and recombination. Characterization of the functions of all host factors in the infected plant cells will likely result in better, more efficient antiviral strategies and/or reduce the damage to the plants caused by viral infections.",
