In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the use of deterministic compartmental models to study the dynamics of measles and finding ways for its control and prevention. For example, in [10], the authors have taken into account the impact of asymptomatic individuals on measles dynamics. In [11], the authors have shown that wider distancing between measles-infected and non-infected people proves effective in controlling the disease spread. Smith et al. [12] and Peter et al. [14] examined the role of vaccination on measles dynamics. Garba et al. [13] designed a deterministic model to assess the effect of vaccination and treatment on measles transmission. The effect of quarantine and treatment on measles spread is studied in [15]. Other significant contributions can be found in [16\u201319]. There are a number of case studies found in the literature related to mathematical study of measles, using deterministic models, focusing different regions of the world, for example, Madagascar [20], London [21], China [22, 23], Kenya [24], Cape Coast [25], Ontario [26], Italy [27], Taiwan [28], Senegal [29] and Afghanistan [30].",

In particular, we aim to analyze the effect of vaccine efficacy and its coverage in preventing the disease spread in the country. Our motivation derives from a few studies [31\u201334] in the literature focused on deterministic modeling of measles disease in Pakistan. Each of these studies is based on a four-compartmental SEIR (S-susceptible, E-exposed, I-infectious and R-recovered) model, and none investigates the role of vaccine efficiency and its coverage rate on the disease control. The model in this study is an extension of SEIR model that includes a separate compartment V for the vaccinated class. The SVEIR model is based on the assumption of continuous vaccination. The findings of present study may assist government and public health authorities in formulating strategic vaccination plans to deal with the immunization gaps and thus prevent measles outbreaks.",
