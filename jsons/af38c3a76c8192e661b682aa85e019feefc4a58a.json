Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. 10 Results: Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed cocirculation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities 15 through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. Conclusions: Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV 20 may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion. 3 One Sentence Summary: Novel 2019-nCoV sequences revealed the evolution and specificity of betacoronavirus with possible mechanisms of enhanced infectivity.

Analysis of the 2019-nCoV shows that it is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the lineage B (subgenus: sarbecovirus) which also includes 15 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 4 . The current 2019-nCoV genome is most phylogenetically similar to Bat/SARS/RaTG13/Yunnan strain, which was first isolated in 2013 in Yunnan, China 15 . Recent studies hinted that pangolin-CoV may be a possible intermediate hosts candidate for the 2019-nCoV 16, 17 . Recently, this novel CoV has been confirmed to use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV 16 . 20 Coronaviruses (CoV) are capable of transmitting among different host species via shifting tropism and variable receptor targeting [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . These characteristics are mediated by changes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike surface glycoprotein 12, 14 . Similar to other well-known enveloped viruses, CoV initiates infection through fusion of this spike protein with the host cell membrane 18 . Their spike protein is comprised of S1 and S2 subunits, which are responsible for host receptor recognition and membrane fusion, respectively 12, 13, 18, 19 . 2019-nCoV has recently been confirmed to use the human ACE2 as receptor 20 . 5 Although the fatality rate of 2019-nCoV is lower and the symptoms are milder than those of SARS, the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV appears to be higher 7 . The molecular mechanisms responsible for such rapid transmission and spread of the 2019-nCoV still remain elusive. Here, we have analyzed 120 2019-nCoV genome sequences including 11 novel strains isolated from patients to determine the viral evolution and divergence. 10 Our studies suggest that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site insertion.",

Considering potential sequencing errors at both ends, the genome sequence variations among different strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients located in different cities were low considering only 5 several mutations in about 30kb genome per isolate. Based on the nucleotide positions 8517 and 27641, the 2019-nCoV strains can be divided into two major groups (Figs 2A and S2). All the group 1 strains have thymine at 8517 and cytosine at 27641, which are same as corresponding nucleotides in SARS, whereas the group 2 stains have cytosine at 8517 and thymine at 27641 (Figs 2A and S3 ). Epidemiological data G1 and G2 strains 10 revealed that the collection date and location of the earliest G1 strain (EPI_ISL_406801) was January 5 th , 2020 in Wuhan, whereas the earliest G2 strain was isolated in December 24 th , 2019 in Wuhan (Fig 2A) . The existence of both genetic groups in the same city indicated co-circulation, but evolved convergently at the early outbreak. Within each group, we also observed additional shared mutations added to multiple strains. Based on 15 these potentially inheritable mutations and the identifying times and locations, we generated a mutation tree map to track individual shared mutations and show the relationships among different isolates (Fig 2A and S2 ). For example, five strains identified in Guangdong from Jan. 10-15 all share the same mutation in nucleotide position 28578 on the background of group 1 might be transmitted by the same person. The similar strain 20 may transmit to three patients identified in Japan on Jan. 29-31 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 2397 and to a patient identified in USA on Jan. 22 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 10818. The G10818T is very interesting as it is shared by several independent strains in both group 1 and group 2, which will lead to L3606F amino acid substitution within the orf1ab polyprotein ( Fig S3) . It is not clear if the common mutation both in group 1 and group 2 strains at 10818 site has any growth advantage but pangolin and bat CoV have L3606V substitution at the same position ( Fig S3) . When the group 1 and group 2 strains were placed onto geographic map (Fig 2B) , it seems that 5 both groups have been transmitted to most countries and regions with reported 2019-nCoV cases with few exceptions, suggesting these two groups are rapidly transmissible.",

The clade II viruses include 49 of bat SARS viruses (bat SARS CoV II) such as ZXC21 and ZC45, which share about 90% overall nucleotide and amino acid identity as the 2019-nCoV (Table S2 ). The major difference between these two clades is that the RBM of the clade II viruses has regions with 5 and 13-14 amino acids shorter than that of the clade I viruses ( Our study also revealed that the 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion 15 (681-PRRA-684) within the spike protein, or within nucleotide position 23,619-23,632 ( Fig   4C) . Interestingly, such an insertion (PRRA) within the spike protein of 2019-nCoV creates a potential cleavage site RRAR for the mammalian furin protein, which the consensus sequence is RXXR. The potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site is inserted at the boundary between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, and the first proline 20 residue of the PRRA insertion may introduce a beta turn into the polypeptide chain. To understand the uniqueness of this insertion, we performed sequence comparison using represented SARS-CoV strains from human, civet and bat. Our study showed that this insertion is unique to the 2019-nCoV ( Figure 4C and S6). When compared to other CoV family members, we found that similar insertion has been identified and are located in the structural boundary between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein ( Figure 4C ).",

To date, there are more confirmed 2019-nCoV cases than that of the whole 2002 SARS outbreak. Coronavirus sequences 10 have been published frequently and consistently over the last 18 years, which included SARS strains isolated from different countries during 2002 SARS outbreak, sporadic CoV strains mainly reported in China, MERS strains isolated from middle east countries such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Fig 1B). To further understand the evolution of the betacoronaviruses and track the mutations accumulated with 2019-nCoV, we have 15 collected and sequenced 11 full-length 2019-nCoV genome sequences from new patients identified in multiple Chinese cities including Wuhan (Fig 1C). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that 11 new strains of 2019-nCoV clustered together with other 2019-nCoV strains and were more homologous to the bat CoV RaTG13 strain than human SARS, MERS and other CoVs",

We further estimated that the divergences of most proteins between 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 happened between 2005 and 2012 whereas those between human SARS and bat SARS-like CoV happened between 1990-2002 (Fig 3B). When the full-length spike protein sequences were compared, 2019-nCoV shares 15 39% sequence homology to human and bat SARS as compared to MERS or other CoV at 29%. Interestingly, we found that 2019-nCoV and pangolin-CoV share near identical amino acid sequence in the RBD (aa 315-550 region) of the spike protein, but not for RaTG13 (Figs 3A and 3D). To confirm this finding, we have compared the pangolin-CoV reported by Liu et al with previously isolated but unpublished pangolin-CoV sequences 20 (Figure S4). Based on the alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we found pangolin/Guangdong/P2S/2019 (EPI_ISL_410544), whereas additional mutations and indels were found in the pangolin-CoV strains isolated in the Guangxi province. Both BetaCoV/pangolin/Guangdong/P2S/2019 and Pangolin-CoV were isolated from Guangdong province of China in 2019. Next we examined the phylogenetic relationship of the consensus spike protein sequence of 2019-nCoV against 25 representative CoV strains including Hu-CoV, SARS and MERS and five new pangolin-5 CoV strains using a ML method (Figure S4). The results demonstrate that the Spike protein of 2019-nCoV is likely derived from Pangolin-CoV but not RaTG13, all of which could be in the same lineage as BAT_SARS-CoV/bat-SL-CoVZC542. The fact that while 2019-nCoV is most homologous to RaTG13 in overall genome structure the RBD of the spike protein is most homologous to Pangolin-CoV, suggests the possible recombination 10 between RaTG13 like and Pangolin-CoV like strains happens in the evolution of 2019-nCoV. We have manually examined all amino acid mutations in the genome. Due to the presence of the unsequenced regions in the Pangolin-CoV sequence, we did not include any positions flanking these regions. We found that when comparing Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV, in addition to the RBD, regions in nsp14 and 15 also shares consecutive 15 sequences (Fig 3D). To further evaluate the 2019-nCoV relationship with other SARS CoVs, we analyzed the RBM of the 2019-nCoV and different human/bat SARS viruses and observed that they can be clearly divided into two distinct clades (Fig 4A). The clade I viruses include 2019-nCoV, pangolin CoVs, 12 of bat SARS (bat SARS CoV I) such as RaTG13, and human 20 SARS",

Although the amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV within this loop region are very different from those 5 of human SARS, the two cysteine residues are conserved(Fig. 4B). Interestingly, all the CoV viruses known to use ACE2 as entry receptor are within the clade I, including the 2019-nCoV, which can also infect cells through ACE2 receptor-based on recent studies 22(Fig. S5). On the other hand, there is no report on using ACE2 as entry receptor for the clade II viruses, despite their overall genome sequence homology with 2019-nCoV.10 Therefore, our studies not only emphasize the critical role of the RBM in determining the specificity of entry receptors but also raise the question on how homologous strains of betacoronavirus switch tropism through mutations such as indel or recombination in the RBM.",

Although most substitutions are de novo mutations, we have identified 5 multiple SNPs shared by different strains of 2019-nCoV. Due to the low mutation rate and large genome capital, we hypothesis that these shared mutations are inherited SNPs from large group of populations, likely transmitted from people to people. Based on this assumption, we have generated the SNP tree to track mutation and spread of 2019-nCoV. Interestingly, the 2019-nCoV stains we have analyzed fall into two distinct groups 10 with different nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 8782 and 28144. Although it remains to be determined if these two distinct groups of 2019-nCoV were evolved before or after transmission from animal to human, both groups were first detected in wuhan and then spread to different regions in China and multiple countries.

The sequences were removed fot 10 that with no less than 28000bp or more than 100 unsolved nucleotides as 'N'. At last, 109 public genomes of 2019-nCoV were kept. The phylogenetic tree for the whole genome was constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) (version 7.0) 32 by the maximum likelihood method under the General Time Reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model, while the phylogenetic trees for the individual genes were 15 constructed by the FigTree software v1.4.3. For the spike protein, given the whole genomes of 2019 nCoVs (118 strains) and other SARS-like viruses isolated from Bat(1 strains) and Pangolin (6 strains), the genes was predicted by GeneMarkS (version 3.36). The predicted genes were then against the proteome of SARS-CoV by BLAST (version 2.2.25+). After that, Spike surface 20 glycoprotein (S) were picked, and RBD domain in Spike was also discriminated. For the protein sequence of Spike genes, we got, multiple sequence alignment was made by using the FFT-NS-2 algorithm in MAFFT v7.407 program, and three regions (50~246aa; RBD domain; 600~796aa) were picked up. Finally, three phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software (version 10.0.5) by the maximum likelihood method with the bootstrap tests (100 replicates), and Fasttree software (version 1.43) were used to visualize these trees. 5 SNP recognition and comparison The SNPs of each sequence were defined as the sites variant from the reference sequence. The ancestral sequence of the phylogenetic tree was used as the reference sequence, which was estimated by python package TimeTree using Jukes-Cantor model and default settings. Site with the unsolved nucleotide N and gap was ignored. The site number of the SNP was decided by sequentially combined the CDS sequences in the whole genome. The phylogenetic tree and the matching SNP for the tips was plotted by ggtree. The geo-distribution and genotype of strains with SNP sites in Wuhan and other areas were plotted by ggplot2.

Its closest relative is the Beta CoV RaTG13, isolated from bat in Yunnan province, China, in 2013, which shares more than 96% identical nucleotides throughout the genome of over 30 kb15,24  . Our evolution clock analysis estimated that 2019-nCoV diverged from RaTG13 and human SARS-CoV at about 12 and 30 years ago, respectively. Beside point mutations, there is also a potential evidence of recombination as a mechanism for the evolution of 2019-nCoV. We found that 2019-nCoV shares high identity with RaTG13 throughout the genome except for the RBD of spike protein, which is closer to Pangolin-CoV isolated in Guangdong 17 . Based on these findings we hypothesized that recombination in the RBD of the spike protein may happen receptors to infect host cells16,28  . Recent studies have indicated ACE2 as the entry receptor for 2019-nCoV 29 although other host cell factors such as TMPRSS2 are likely involved 30 . When we used the receptor binding motifs to conduct phylogenic analysis, we could separate 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS into two distinct clades.Interestingly, all the viruses known to use ACE2 as the entry receptor are within the clade15 I whereas all the bat SARS viruses which do not use ACE2 entry receptors belong to clade II. Therefore, we predict that the clade I CoV viruses including the 2019-nCoV can",
