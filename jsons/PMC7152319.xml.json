            "text": "Rotaviruses (family Reoviridae) are 100-nm, triple-layered particles comprised of an outer capsid, inner capsid, and core.4 The double-stranded RNA genome is composed of 11 segments which code for 6 structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and 6 nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6). The outer capsid is composed of 2 proteins, VP7 (G protein, for glycoprotein) and VP4 (P protein, for protease-cleaved protein). These proteins are the principal antigens to which neutralizing antibodies are directed and are the proteins that account for the classification scheme for rotavirus strains. The middle layer is made up of the VP6 protein, which is the most abundant protein in the virus and is the protein to which common immune diagnostics are directed. Rotaviruses commonly are classified according to group and serotype. Six groups of rotavirus have been described (A to F), and are based on differences in the VP6 protein. Only viruses in groups A, B, and C are known to cause disease in humans, with group A viruses being the principal cause of human disease. Groups B and C rotaviruses also cause gastroenteritis but are uncommon, and may disproportionately affect adults5, 6, 7, 8 (see Chapter 216, Rotaviruses). Group A rotaviruses are further classified by serotype based on their VP7 (G) and VP4 (P) proteins. While more than 10 P types and G types have each been described,9 5 G types (G1 to G4 and G9) and 3 P types (P[4], P[6], and P[8]) predominate globally.9 Over 40 P\u2013G combinations have been detected, but only 5 combinations of these common types generally account for more than 90% of circulating viruses: P[8]G1, P[4]G2, P[8]G3, P[8]G4, and P[8]G9. P[8]G1 strains are the dominant strain worldwide, accounting for 50% to 90% of seasonal strains characterized in most large reviews.10, 11, 12 Less common strains, such as G8, G12, and G5 strains, may be of public health importance and may even predominate in any given season.13, 14\n",

When viewed by electron microscopy, sapoviruses have characteristic cup-shaped depressions over the surface of the virion (Greek, calyx = cup), but the noroviruses, have rough, nondistinct borders and lack the calyx appearance (Figure 58-1\n). Noroviruses are further divided into five genogroups (I to V), three of which (I, II, and, rarely, IV) cause human disease. At least 8 and 19 genotypes, respectively, have been identified for genogroups I and II.17, 18 Genogroup II genotype 4 (GGII.4) viruses have been the most common cause of outbreaks in recent years; the emergence of new GGII.4 strains has been associated with a global increase in gastroenteritis outbreaks.19, 20\n",

Since introduction of routine vaccination in the U.S., the rotavirus season has diminished substantially in magnitude, and also has been delayed by 2 to 4 months in some years.45, 46 In the U.S., summertime rotavirus infections are rare (with most positive test results falsely positive), but can occur among immunocompromised children.47\n",

Globally, norovirus is estimated to cause 12% of severe diarrheal disease in children <5 years of age.58 In the U.S., norovirus also is the most commonly reported cause of foodborne disease while in international settings, estimates vary widely.56, 59, 60 Common foods associated with outbreaks include uncooked products contaminated by ill foodhandlers who are shedding virus, and shellfish harvested from contaminated water. Healthcare facilities, including nursing homes and hospitals, are the most common settings of norovirus outbreaks, with other closed environments such as childcare facilities and cruise ships frequently affected. The emergence of new variants of norovirus (genogroup II type 4) may be associated with unusual seasonal activity and a surge in outbreaks.19, 20, 61 All age groups can be infected with noroviruses, but serosurveys document that first infection is acquired at an early age.3\n",

Rotavirus infections also can cause secretory diarrhea due to the opening of calcium channels, which results in an influx of calcium and efflux of sodium and water (associated with a nonstructural viral protein, NSP4).84, 85 The intraenterocyte calcium concentration also leads to cell death. In a normal host, infection resolves as the number of susceptible mature enterocytes decreases due to cell death and as the host generates an immune response.

(A) Rotaviruses are 70- to 80-nm multi-shelled particles; the inner shell has a visible \u201cwheel and spoke\u201d character. (B) Adenoviruses are 70- to 90-nm icosahedral structured viruses with fiber extensions on their vertices. The fibers are fragile and not always seen on cell culture prepared adenovirus or on virus seen in fecal suspensions. (C\u2013E) Noroviruses and sapoviruses are 33- to 40-nm viruses. Fecal suspension particles often are coated with gastrointestinal derived antibodies as shown in panel C. Human noroviruses and sapoviruses are fastidious but virus-like particles (VLPs) formed of capsid proteins can be produced in recombinant-based cultures, as shown in panels D and E. The calicivirus VLPs may be slightly larger (37 to 41 nm) than their respective viruses but have typical calicivirus structure. Panel D VLPs were derived from sapovirus and panel E from norovirus. The \u201cstar of David\u201d image associated with caliciviruses is readily apparent on sapovirus VLPs D but is not visible on norovirus VLPs E. (F) Astroviruses are 25\u201330 nm, have a smooth edge, and a distinctive 5- or 6-pointed star on some particles in fecal-suspension derived virus. The smooth surface is not always present on astroviruses grown in culture and can resemble miniature versions of noroviruses. Scale bars = 100 nm.",
