A hypothetical GP5 containing all selected sites was constructed to determine its characteristics. These sequences corresponded to isolates obtained 10 years apart (1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995) 18 strains) and a second set (n = 46) from 2000 to 2005. Similarity to Lelystad virus (LV) decreased from 95.5% in 1991-1995 to 89.5% in 2000-2005. Three highly variable regions were found in ORF5. Codon usage was different in both sets for leucine, glutamine, serine and proline. Thus, 2000-2005 sequences used codons more similar to those present in highly expressed pig genes compared to the 1991-1995 set. Twenty four sites of positive selection and 20 sites of negative selection were found in GP5, most of them in transmembrane regions. Additional glycosylation in N37 of GP5 was common in 2000-2005 but some sequences lack a glycosylation site in N46. The hypothetical GP5 was only 88.1% similar to LV and was less hydrophobic.

Two different genotypes are currently known, the European one and the American one. Genetic similarity between both genotypes ranges from 50 to 70% depending on the open reading frame (ORF) examined (Meng et al., 1994) . PRRSV genome is composed of nine ORFs of which ORF1a and 1b encode the viral polymerase, ORFs 2-6 encode envelope and membrane proteins (called GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, GP5 and M, respectively) and ORF7 encodes the non-glycosylated viral nucleocapsid protein (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Wu et al., 2005) . Among the envelope proteins, GP5 seems to be one of the key viral structures. It is thought that attachment and entry to the target cells is mediated by GP5 or GP5-M heterodimers (Snijder et al., 2003) . In addition, the neutralisation epitope of PRRSV is located in the middle of the GP5 ectodomain (Gonin et al., 1999; Ostrowski et al., 2002; Plagemann, 2004a,b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 241, "end": 260, "text": "(Meng et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 519, "end": 549, "text": "(Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 550, "end": 566, "text": "Wu et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 748, "end": 770, "text": "(Snijder et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 869, "end": 889, "text": "(Gonin et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 890, "end": 913, "text": "Ostrowski et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 914, "end": 933, "text": "Plagemann, 2004a,b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "From early studies, it became evident that ORF5 was one of the most variable regions in the PRRSV genome although other parts also show a considerable degree of variability as occurs in ORF3 and in non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) (Fang et al., 2004; Oleksiewicz et al., 2000) .

Genetic variability observed in ORF5 is consistent with the well known fact that RNA-polymerases of RNA viruses have a relatively poor fidelity (Castro et al., 2005) and with the notion that selective pressures act favouring viral variants better fitted for spread and persistence in the target hosts. As GP5 is exposed in the viral envelope, participates in viral attachment to cells and contains a neutralisation epitope, it is a potential target for these selective pressures.

With the available data it is impossible to know whether the newer strains represent a PRRSV type that slowly evolved from older strains or if they represent an old type that gained predominance. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain Spanish sequences from 1996 to 1999 and therefore we could not fill this gap; however, the analysis of 153 GP5 European-type sequences from different countries and periods yielded similar results (not shown). The closest matches to the hypothetical GP5 included strains from different countries and periods but the oldest known match was a Spanish strain from 1991 not included in this study. This fact would support the hypothesis that similarity to the hypothetical GP5 has some benefit because this profile has become predominant in Spain all over the years.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The hypothetical strain was similar to LV but had two additional characteristics that lacked in LV. The first was a change in the sites of glycosylation compared to LV. One was located at the start of the ectodomain (Asp-37) and the second was located at the known neutralisation epitope (Asp-53). This hypothetical GP5 would lose thus the glycosylation site at Asp-46. In contrast, positive selection in position 37 introduces a new glycosylation site. Previous studies suggested that the lack of this glycosylation at Asp-46 reduces virus infectivity and can be a marker of attenuation (Wissink et al., 2004) . However, according to Pesch et al. (2005) , glycosylation at position 46 can be found in three European-type attenuated vaccines of which only one also has a glycosylation at position 37. Several authors claimed that these additional glycosylation sites may serve to mask the key B-epitopes (Chen et al., 1998) although this has not been proven yet for PRRSV. The second fact that differentiates the hypothetical GP5 from that of LV was a lesser hydrophobic profile. The consequence would be a more exposed GP5 that could better interact with the receptors in target cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 588, "end": 610, "text": "(Wissink et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 635, "end": 654, "text": "Pesch et al.

This evolution included positive and negative selections of given aminoacids in specific sites of the PRRSV genome, mainly in transmembrane segments of GP5.
