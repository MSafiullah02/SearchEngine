Though the pandemic of the virus has been real and caused many tragedies, observers criticised the attention it received from politicians, global health agencies and experts. Critics warned especially of the potential to exploit pandemic threats for fear\u2010mongering and profit\u2010making (Gostin 2009; Sparke 2009), overshadowing at the same time other long\u2010term global health problems, often related to social inequalities (Craddock and Giles\u2010Vernick 2010; Davies 2010). With hindsight, the event of swine flu appears as a small event in respect to anticipated severity and death rates. Nevertheless, public health officials and experts stressed their moral obligation to abide to the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d to prevent as much harm as possible even if that means taking some extreme measures, spreading anxiety and playing into the hands of the pharma industry (Caduff 2010; Gallaher 2009; Michaelis, Doerr and Cinatl 2009).",

It was exceptionally widely covered by the news media, inciting a broad range of responses by state and non\u2010state actors, occupying the attention of millions of people for a greater part of 2009. Responses included mass distribution of antiviral drugs, production and stockpiling of vaccines, mass slaughtering of pigs in Egypt, quarantine for slightly feverish air passengers in China, restrictions and cancellations of flights to Mexico, and Asian import bans on pork products from the USA. Each individual reaction contributed to swine flu as a global event of anxiety through intensifying and amplifying the sense of urgency in the face of this new infectious disease.",

            "text": "Due to the early emergence of novel H1N1 in North America, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were at the forefront of H1N1 emergency response. Scientists working for CDC were among the first to identify the new microbe and to carry out substantial virological and epidemiological research (special issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases 1 January 2011, supplement 1; Dawood et al 2009). They informed the public, politicians, WHO and other public health agencies worldwide. Put simply, the way the world initially learned about H1N1 was significantly shaped by CDC. From a social science perspective, its central role qualifies CDC as a powerful lens through which we can seek to understand H1N1' sudden rise to prominence and the ways it was dealt with. Investigating CDC' H1N1 response may also shed light on the implications of a change in public health discourse, a change that made \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d a key concern for public health, the kernel of a new age of \u201cpandemic anxiety\u201d (Ingram 2008).",

Building upon Schatzki' (2002) practice theory, the phenomenon of anxiety can be opened up to a much broader analysis since anxieties \u201care embodied and social, practical and practised\u201d and like \u201cother social practices, they are routinised, collective and conventional in character\u201d (Jackson and Everts 2010:2801). Here, of particular interest is how anxieties become \u201cinstitutionalised\u201d and worked through within organisations (Jackson and Everts 2010:2799). Certain events engender anxieties specific to an organisation, overlapping with general concerns in respect to the event. Events important to an organisation can threaten its meaning of existence, its legitimacy and its credibility. In the case of emerging diseases, pandemics pose a threat and challenge to public health agencies, creating anxieties over its reputation and expertise. Although these latter anxieties are derived from pandemic anxiety, they are significant in their own right, shedding light on general anxieties pertaining to that specific organisation and its area of expertise.",

Research conducted within CDC in early 2011, involving expert interviews, informal conversations and observation, provides the background for the findings presented. The aim is to use CDC as a lens through which we can, partially at least, understand the ways in which pandemic anxieties work. This entails a closer look at the securitisation of public health and the challenges and struggles this may have caused within public health agencies such as CDC. In the next section, a brief account of the securitisation of public health discourse is provided. Then, CDC' formal entanglement with global health security and its announcement of the H1N1 pandemic are presented. This is followed by shifting the perspective onto various people who were engaged in the emergency response and their practices and practical struggles in the face of pandemic anxiety.",

The analytical kernel of this changing discourse is perhaps best captured by the term \u201csecuritisation\u201d (Fidler and Gostin 2008:143). Here, securitisation refers to the observation that much of public health discourse has become organised around concerns over security rather than, say, humanitarianism or welfare. Following Elbe (2010:4), we can distinguish analytically at least between four types of security relevant to the emerging \u201chealth\u2013security nexus\u201d: national security, biosecurity, human security, and public health security.",

By employing scale politics, eminent scientists in the field of virology, microbiology and epidemiology were able to provide answers to uncertainties arising from globalisation. By making emerging infectious disease the key challenge, enhanced laboratory practice and disease surveillance appeared as effective and nationally manageable countermeasures against the adverse effects of globalisation. This particular discursive strategy was effectively conveyed to politicians and journalists at the 1989 conference on \u201cEmerging Viruses: The Evolution of Viruses and Viral Disease\u201d, chaired by eminent virologist Stephen S. Morse from Rockefeller University. Also highly influential was the publication of the report Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (1992), presenting the views of a committee convened by the National Academy of Science' Institute of Medicine in 1991. The report became the blueprint for rapidly evolving literature and strategy plans on how to tackle the problem of emerging infectious diseases (King 2004:68\u201369). Public awareness was achieved through the media and journalist writers, since \u201cthe concept of emerging diseases offered journalists a powerful scalar resource for characterizing individual outbreaks as incidents of global significance\u201d (King 2004:70).",

From there it is only a small step to biosecurity, another security framework increasingly important to public health. For Collier, Lakoff and Rabinow (2004), growing concerns over bioterrorism and uncertainties in relation to new research possibilities culminating in the Human Genome Project, provide the context of the \u201cemerging biosecurity apparatus\u201d. The apparatus has as its main aim to \u201cmake life safe\u201d through \u201cattempts to monitor, regulate and/or halt the movements of various forms of life\u201d (Bingham, Enticott and Hinchliffe 2008:1528). This entails a problematic justification for repressive internal politics as much as for new forms of imperial politics. As Braun (2007:22) argues, biosecurity is \u201ca set of political technologies that seek to govern biological disorder in the name of a particular community, through acts that are extraterritorial\u201d (emphasis in the original).",

In discussing pandemic anxieties, Ingram (2008:75\u201376) identifies three main facets of global health security discourse: the emergence of the global as the definitive context for infectious disease; a tendency to locate causes, origins, and responsibility elsewhere and with others; and the emergence of global health security as a guise for the consolidation of hegemonic interests. Notably, global health security discourse advances at the expense of other discursive formations, in particular that of human security and humanitarianism. Following Lakoff (2010), we can juxtapose global health security and humanitarian biomedicine as two competing public health regimes. \u201cHumanitarian biomedicine\u201d refers to the ongoing effort to mitigate existing health problems prevalent especially among poorer nations. In contrast, \u201cglobal health security\u201d focuses on \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d\u2014diseases that have not occurred yet, for which one must be prepared, and which are more relevant to richer countries. \u201cWhereas global health security develops prophylaxis against potential threats at home, humanitarian biomedicine invests resources to mitigate present suffering in other places\u201d (Lakoff 2010:60).",

In discussing the Canadian response to SARS, Keil and Ali claim that \u201cracism, infection, globalized urbanization are reshuffled into a new political frame of reference\u201d since \u201cRacism, linked specifically to infectious disease and the bodies allegedly carrying it, structures biopolitical space of the SARS crisis and requires that it be understood from the point of view of affected communities: East Asians and those who were identified as such\u201c (Keil and Ali 2006:30; emphasis in the original). The Egyptian response to H5N1 showed another securitisation bias towards large\u2010scale \u201cmodern\u201d economies. The cull affected mainly rooftop and backyard poultry but restocking was in favour of large companies (Hinchliffe and Bingham 2008).

However, the 1989 \u201cEmerging Viruses\u201d conference and the 1992 \u201cEmerging Infections\u201d report seem to signify the beginning of an acceleration of a specific interweaving of public health and security discourse. From a CDC perspective, the tipping point was the anthrax scare that followed the 9/11 attacks. Since then, CDC experienced a \u201cculture shift\u201d, as my respondents phrased it. Although US security politics were already attuned to the perceived threat of bioterrorism (King 2003), anthrax gave the immediate impetus for changing the make\u2010up of US public health organisations. And this was by no means only a discursive shift. Since 2001, CDC was gradually reformed from a scientific branch of the federal government into an intelligence service supplementing national security and defence politics. This change was achieved through a great influx of retired military personnel who began work for CDC in various divisions. Some became advisor to the director, which brought further changes to the organisational and spatial structure. CDC in pre\u20102001 years resembled a very large research institute or university, openly accessible to virtually everyone. However it has become more than ever a hierarchically organised agency with command structures, which resemble those of military departments; and CDC campuses are now fenced off and only accessible through security check points.",

As an explanation for this, some of my interviewees pointed repeatedly to the response structures that were built under the impression of H5N1: \nregarding H1N1, the awareness was already there and somehow we could tap into it. For H5N1, we did a lot of pandemic influenza planning and in every [US] state we had a conference about what needs to be done. And a year later, (with H1N1), we were able to turn that on.

According to CDC epidemiologists, various cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) were investigated in the years before the actual outbreak in 2009. The background to this was the position statement by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) that made all novel influenza A viruses nationally reportable in 2007 (CSTE 2007). In particular, the position statement from CSTE requires that \u201cstate and territorial epidemiologists in conjunction with public health laboratories will report to CDC all human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human influenza H1 and H3 viruses\u201d, including viruses \u201cthat are subtyped as non\u2010human in origin and those that are unsubtypable with standard methods and reagents\u201d (CSTE 2007). This step was justified on two grounds. First, any novel influenza A virus could \u201csignal the beginning of an influenza pandemic\u201d and, in turn, \u201crapid detection and reporting\u201d would \u201cfacilitate prompt detection and characterization\u201d and \u201caccelerate the implementation of effective public health responses\u201d. Second, the USA had formally accepted the revised International Health Regulations 2005 (WHO 2008) in 2006. The new regulations demand its member states to notify the WHO on various events detected by national surveillance systems, among them cases of \u201chuman influenza caused by a new subtype\u201d which are deemed\u2014among others (smallpox, polio, SARS)\u2014as \u201cunusual or unexpected and may have serious public health impact\u201d (WHO 2008:43).",

Field investigations could confirm in most cases that children had been to a country fair or farm where they were exposed to live animals, especially pigs (cf Shinde et al 2009).

In the case of H1N1, at least three anxieties at CDC were crucial: anxieties over the quality or \u201caccuracy\u201d of data; anxieties over how to deal with the media and striking a balance between raising awareness and not being alarmist; and anxieties over staying informed and being the first ones to know.",

Nevertheless, pandemic anxiety certainly augments these \u201cinstitutionalised\u201d anxieties and makes them more pressing issues. They need to be worked through by employing various strategies and practices. The sense of urgency engendered by pandemic anxiety creates time compression for those involved in emergency response. Over fears that speed threatens to compromise the validity of scientific data, resistance to constant calls for new data becomes a vital strategy. By putting the data into context, public health and communication experts try to \u201cget the message through\u201d without creating panic or giving the media reason for alarmist reporting. Staying informed and the need to be the first ones to know is achieved through ever more sophisticated surveillance systems. At times, the new systems turn around the relationship between those who seek information and those who provide information: by registering for any CDC alert service or calling the hotline, CDC gets crucial information about emerging health\u2010related worries and its whereabouts in real time.",

Taking the view from within CDC, securitisation has brought about changes for better and worse. Being more attuned to the need for real\u2010time data and the need to be constantly aware of emerging threats is certainly nothing that troubles public health experts and scientists as such. As one respondent phrased it: \u201cpreparing for the worst is a good thing to do and nothing that should be incriminated \u2026 [it]' part of the job, always foreshadowing what could happen but without being sensational \u2026 [the problem is], in the ensuing discussion, hindsight seems to be more important than good decision\u2010making.\u201d",

Promoting a critical understanding of how pandemic anxieties work can help in evaluating their importance. Historically, slower modes of detection meant that awareness of the emerging threat was perhaps closely related to actual fatalities. Nowadays, we are already aware of the potential threat before we have seen what course it will take. Under these circumstances, pandemic anxieties are more and more likely to be based on anticipating the characteristics of the new pathogen rather than actual disease and deaths. Thus, the new powers derived from rapid detection technologies need to be critically appraised since we have not yet developed a pragmatic culture of living with constant emergency.",
