Transgenics enables the in vivo modulation of gene activity in a spatial- and temporal-specific manner, greatly enhancing our ability to analyze the functions of genes involved in lipoprotein biology as well as to build animal models for atherosclerosis and other disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. Transgenic models also complement well with the increasing number of available knockout/knockin and other mutant mouse lines generated by both ethyl nitrosourea (ENU) and gene-trapping mutagenesis. These loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches synergistically increase our ability to understand complex physiological processes and mechanisms of disease.",

Recent advancements in site-specific recombinase systems, such as Cre-loxP, FLP-FRT and Dre-rox systems [6], and site-specific endonucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (Talens) [7], have begun to launch the era of site-specific or targeted transgenics [8]. However, as of today, the great majority of transgenic projects are still carried out using the conventional random integration method. In spite of three decades of experimentation and optimization, our ability to predict and control the expression of randomly inserted transgenes is still far from satisfactory. Nevertheless, some important knowledge and general guidelines for controlling transgene expression have accumulated over the past three decades. Following these guidelines can significantly improve, although not guarantee, the odds of proper transgene expression. This chapter is mainly aimed at providing beginners with a broad perspective on the applications of the conventional transgenic technology. It is impossible to discuss each topic in much detail, and therefore many important innovations and contributions are not mentioned here.",

One important lesson learned from the past three decades is that the genomic environment surrounding the site of integration can exert a profound influence on expression of the transgene. In the cell nucleus, chromatin interacts extensively with the nuclear matrix and other proteins to form looped and topologically constrained domains. Distinct boundary elements or insulators embedded in the genome separate it into regions where gene expression is often facilitated or repressed. Consequently, it is not surprising that the promoter activity of the inserted transgene is subject to the influence of the local genomic environment as well as distant transcriptional enhancers or repressors.",

            "text": "These chromosomal position effects are typically represented in the following forms. First, it is quite common that some of the transgenic lines do not express the transgene at all or express it at a very low level. These silenced transgenic lines are often eliminated during the initial period of transgenic mouse characterization. Second, altered transgene expression refers to transgenic lines with spatial or temporal expression patterns that do not match those expected based on the promoters used to drive the transgenes. This is often a result of the influence of a strong promoter/enhancer/repressor near the integration site. Third, mosaic transgene expression is another often-encountered problem, i.e., the transgene is expressed only in a portion of cells of the same tissue. Fourth, progressive extinction also happens to some transgenes. In this case, the transgene gives correct and robust expression when the transgenic line is first established, but its expression decreases or even completely stops after multiple generations of breeding. Chromosomal epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation probably play important roles in diminishing the expression of these transgenes. Most researchers carefully characterize their transgenic lines when they are first created, but then do not reexamine transgene expression thereafter. Many scientists who receive mice from another laboratory tend to trust the published initial characterization results. Therefore, failure to periodically check transgene expression can potentially lead to erroneous scientific conclusions.",

For example, genes of mammalian origin usually express better than genes of nonmammalian origin [9]. Prokaryote-derived cloning vector sequences often strongly suppress transgene expression if they are not removed from the transgene. Genomic DNA usually expresses better than cDNA [10, 11]. When many copies of transgenes are inserted as tandem repeats at the same location, they are more likely to be silenced [12, 13]. While introns may facilitate the export of mRNA out of the nucleus, which at least partially explains why genomic DNA is better than cDNA for achieving gene expression, the other observed phenomena still remain to be explained, although chromosomal epigenetic modifications are believed to be the main suspect.",

            "text": "The importance of ensuring correct DNA construct design for transgenic projects can be puzzling to beginners, because their experience is often grounded in transfecting and expressing foreign genes in cultured mammalian cells. After all, shouldn\u2019t cultured cells and cells in live animals have similar, if not exactly the same, genomic organization and transcriptional machinery? To help clear the confusion, it should be pointed out that the majority of in vitro transfection experiments involve transient transfection. The DNA vectors do not even integrate into the genome, and therefore they are not subjected to complicated genomic environmental influences. In fact, for generation of stable cell lines, the same problems of chromosomal position effects and epigenetic modifications do exist, as reviewed by Kwaks and Otte [14]. However, because hundreds of thousands or millions of cells are normally used in each cell transfection experiment, it is usually not very difficult to find some cells with the expected gene expression. In the case of transgenic animals, creating and maintaining each transgenic line is labor-intensive and costly. Most scientists do not have the luxury of selecting several perfect lines from many available transgenic lines. Furthermore, each transgenic animal contains hundreds of different cell types, whereas each cell transfection experiment normally uses only one type of cell. Therefore, unexpected patterns of tissue-specific gene expression are far more likely to show up in transgenic mice than in a particular cell line. Lastly, useful transgenic models need to be maintained for a very long time, for multiple generations. Moreover, authentic transgene expression must also be properly maintained through the changes in gene activities and overall genomic modifications associated with the different stages of embryonic and postnatal development. In contrast, the changes in gene expression and epigenetic modification in stably transfected cell lines are rather limited.",

An optional fourth DNA element is a genomic boundary element for reducing position effects. The promoter and transcribed region will be \u00addiscussed in more detail in Subheading 4.1.

Plasmid-based transgenes are relatively small, and hence they are prone to influences of the neighboring chromatin environment. Over the years, several genomic DNA elements have been employed to reduce chromosomal position effects. The locus control region (LCR) initially derived from the \u03b2-globin gene can improve \u00adtransgene expression by positively stimulating transcription, \u00adpresumably by imposing a chromatin configuration that favors gene expression [16]. Another class of elements is the so-called matrix- or scaffold-attachment regions (MARs/SARs). They appear to mediate their effects by acting as a barrier to both positive and negative signals from the surrounding environment [17]. Enhancer-blocking (EB) insulators and barrier insulators [18] have also been tested for improving transgene expression. Many positive results have been reported with these elements, but negative results are also frequently found (see reviews 19, 20). Therefore, use of boundary elements in transgenic constructs is not yet widespread. Further characterization of these genomic boundary elements should increase their use not only for controlling transgene expression but also in gene therapy.",

For the great majority of mouse and human genes, BAC clones are readily available from repositories such as the BACPAC Resource Center at Oakland Children\u2019s Hospital (http://bacpac.chori.org/). These fully sequenced BAC clones are usually 100\u2013300 kb long, and can be used directly for generating transgenic mouse lines. The main advantage of BACs is that they are more likely to contain all the genomic regulatory elements required for mimicking the endogenous gene expression pattern. Also, large pieces of DNA can better shield the transgene from unwanted position effects. When overlapping BAC clones containing the same gene are available, it is best to choose the clone that contains not only the entire transcribed region of the gene but also as much 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking regions as possible. When more than 50 kb of genomic region flanks both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the gene, the probability of faithful and reproducible transgene expression is as high as 85 % [23]. However, one potential problem with using large BACs is that larger clones are more likely to include neighboring genes.

BAC clones from a different species such as human or rat can be used, which are often different enough to allow differentiation of the transgene from the endogenous gene. Alternatively, molecular tags such as FLAG tag or GFP can be added to the transgene.",

It has been reported that linear and circular BAC DNAs were equally efficient in resulting in transgenic mice [27], but in our hands linear BACs appear to be more efficient for producing positive founders (unpublished observation). Shearing is a potential problem during preparation, storage, and microinjection of BAC as well as other large DNA molecules. BAC DNA should be stored in TE buffer or microinjection buffer supplied with salt and polyamines to make the long DNA strands more compact and hence less prone to shearing. Wide-bore pipette tips should be used for transferring BAC DNA solutions. When microinjecting linearized BACs, slightly larger needle openings and lower injection pressures are preferable for minimizing shearing.",

Consequently, full-length cDNAs are often used to make transgenic constructs, and many of them are expressed well. However, many experienced transgenic researchers prefer to incorporate a heterologous intron, such as introns from \u03b2-globin, SV40, or adenovirus, into their constructs to increase the odds of successful expression. For instance, the pCI and pSI vectors marketed by Promega contain a chimeric intron (\u03b2-globin donor site and immunoglobulin acceptor site) at the 5\u2032 end of the cloned gene.

It is noteworthy that some of the most commonly used promoters for transfecting cultured cells are not the best choice for directing ubiquitous gene expression in transgenic animals. Such promoters are small in size and very convenient, but they are subject to heavy position effects. For example, CMV is considered a ubiquitous promoter for transfecting a wide variety of cultured mammalian cells. However, in transgenic mice its effects are not as ubiquitous [31]. For ubiquitous transgene expression, good results have been achieved using the ROSA26 and the CAGGS (chicken b-actin promoter with CMV early enhancer) promoters. For tissue-specific expression, proven promoters for most major tissues or cell types can be found in the literature. For instance, the Tie2 promoter has been shown to be able to direct transgene expression specifically in the vascular endothelium [32]. Tissue-specific promoters for liver, intestine, and macrophage, which are of particular interest to lipoprotein researchers, are discussed in 10.1007/978-1-60327-369-5_12 of this volume.

Knowing the exact cell types and developmental stages in which a particular gene is normally expressed can shed light on its physiological functions. Generating and characterizing transgenic mice is the most efficient method for examining in vivo gene expression patterns. A good starting point is to place several kilobases of promoter region in front of a suitable reporter gene. Depending on whether the reporter gene expression is able to match the pattern of endogenous gene expression, the length of the promoter can be subsequently increased or decreased to identify important genomic regulatory elements. For most genes a few kilobases or even several hundred base pairs of DNA upstream of the transcription initiation sites are enough to confer tissue-specific gene expression. However, for some other genes, dozens of kilobases of promoter region or even entire BACs are not sufficient for recapitulating the in vivo expression pattern of the gene.

The disadvantage is that extensive breeding and genotyping are required; furthermore, the obtained genotypes are not stable and hence the transgenes may segregate in subsequent generations. Several alternative methods exist for incorporating multiple transgenes into the same transgenic line. First, two or more separate transgenes can be mixed and co-microinjected. Because multiple copies of transgenes are often cointegrated at the same genomic location, there is a good chance that both transgenes are integrated in the same locus in the same transgenic line. Such transgenic lines can be stably maintained without tedious crossbreeding and genotyping. When mixing DNA constructs for microinjection, the DNA concentration for each construct should be proportionally reduced so that the total DNA concentration remains in the normal 1\u20132 \u03bcg/ml range. Otherwise the elevated DNA concentration may reduce the survivability of the injected embryos. Second, two transgenes, each containing its own promoter and polyadenylation sequence, can be cloned into the same transgenic vector. Third, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) can be used to create bi- or polycistronic mRNA, which enables the production of two or more proteins from the same mRNA. However, the efficiency of the polycistronic system still varies greatly, depending on the sources of the IRESs, the genes to be expressed, and the distance between the two genes relative to the IRES sequence, as if the cistrons interfere with each other. The rules for governing IRES efficiency are not clear, but it is generally recommended to place the more important gene in front of, and the less important gene (such as the reporter or marker gene) after, the IRES. Fourth, 2A peptides have been increasingly used as alternatives to the IRES in expressing multiple proteins from one DNA construct. The 2A sequences were first identified in picornaviruses, which encode relative short peptides (\u223c20 amino acids) that can cause ribosomal skipping and consequently result in multiple polypetides being made from the same mRNA. They function efficiently in a wide variety of eucaryotes, ranging from yeast to human cells, including in transgenic mice [48].",

This can be done by inserting Cre into the 5\u2032 UTR of the BAC clones. However, it must be pointed out that the commonly used BAC vectors (RPCI-23 library from the C57BL/6 J mouse strain and RPCI-22 from the 129/SvEv mouse strain) already possess loxP sites.

Generally, these reporter lines contain a floxed (for Cre) or flirted (for FLP) translation STOP cassette between a ubiquitous promoter and a reporter gene. In the absence of the recombinase, the reporter protein is not expressed. However, in tissues where recombinase is expressed, the reporter gene product is produced because the STOP cassette has been deleted by the recombinase. It is important to note that the pattern of tissue-specific promoter activity revealed by ordinary reporter gene assay, as discussed in Subheading 4.2, can only report the status of promoter activity at the moment when the tissues were harvested. However, the patterns revealed by the recombinase reporter mice are more like fate mapping. Recombinase-mediated DNA excision is irreversible, and therefore even brief expression of the recombinase can permanently delete the DNA flanked by the loxP or FRT sites not only in that particular cell but also in all of its progeny. This characteristic makes it more difficult to conduct tissue-specific knockout experiments in certain cell types, because many seemingly tissue-specific promoters in adult mice also transiently express in some other cell types during embryonic development. That is why inducible recombinase transgenic lines are often needed to achieve tissue-specific knockout (see Subheading 4.7).",

Sometimes the Cre protein can be transported from one cell to another, or even from the uterine lining of the mother to an early embryo. Sometimes, males and females from the same transgenic line behave differently in terms of Cre expression [58]. The genetic background of the mouse can also apparently influence Cre expression [59].

However, Cre and FLP are not efficient for inserting DNA, mainly because the inserted DNA is quickly deleted by the same enzyme due to the reversible nature of the reaction. For achieving site-specific insertion, another site-specific recombinase, \u03c6C31, is utilized. It catalyzes homologous recombination between two nonidentical sites, attB and attP [64]. When one DNA molecule containing one site is inserted into another molecule containing the other site, recombination results in two chimeric sites which cannot be recognized by the \u03c6C31 recombinase, and therefore are not subsequently deleted.

These systems require the interbreeding of two transgenic mouse lines, one carrying the gene of interest under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (fusion of CMV minimal promoter and seven copies of the TetO sequence termed the tetracycline response element or TRE), and the other carrying the \u00adtranscriptional activator (tTA for the Tet-off system or rtTA for the Tet-on \u00adsystem). In the absence of tTA or rtTA, the CMV minimal promoter is not enough to drive expression of the transgene. However, when tTA or rtTA binds to the TetO sequences of the tetracycline-inducible promoter, RNA polymerase can be recruited to the CMV \u00adminimum promoter to begin transcription. Both tTA and rtTA are created by fusion of a TetR protein and the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein, but they behave oppositely in terms of their requirements for tetracycline to activate the tetracycline-inducible promoter. tTA requires the absence of tetracycline for binding to TRE, whereas rtTA requires the presence of tetracycline to be able to bind to the promoter.

There are dozens of ubiquitous or tissue-specific tTA and rtTA transgenic lines available at The Jackson Laboratory. One advantage of the rtTA over the tTA system is that induction of gene expression can be achieved quickly. This is because the added doxycycline can enter the tissues in a matter of minutes or hours, whereas clearing it out of the system usually takes days. It is worth mentioning that for brain tissues, it takes a longer period of time for the added doxycycline to take effect because of the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, the disadvantage of the rtTA system is that basal level (leaky) expression appears to be higher [75, 76].",

            "text": "The conditional system described in the previous section and the inducible systems described here can be combined to create inducible conditional systems. Schonig et al. [78] reported that a tetracycline-inducible Cre transgene line can be successfully generated, but some other studies [79] have had trouble generating efficient tetracycline-inducible Cre lines. Because the tetracycline-inducible system itself requires two mouse lines, when they are further crossed to the conditional knockout/knockin mouse line, breeding and genotyping become very complicated. Therefore, the tamoxifen-inducible system is often adopted for achieving inducible recombinase transgene expression. In this case, the Cre protein is fused to a modified estrogen receptor (ER) protein. Depending on the presence or absence of estrogen analogs, particularly tamoxifen or 4-hydroxy (OH) tamoxifen, ER can drag the recombinase in and out of cell nuclei [80]. In the absence of tamoxifen, the Cre\u2013ER fusion proteins stay in the cytoplasm. Upon tamoxifen administration, tamoxifen binds to ER to cause a conformational change in the receptor and result in transport of the Cre\u2013ER fusion protein into the nucleus. Because Cre needs to be located in the cell nucleus to perform its function of mediating homologous recombination between two loxP sites, its activity can be effectively turned on and off by tamoxifen. Several versions of Cre\u2013ER fusion proteins are currently available, and CreERT2 appears to be the most sensitive variant to date. Hunter et al. [81] created the FLPeERT2 fusion gene, which can be used for inducibly removing sequences flanked by FRTs. Besides ER, the progesterone receptor (PR) can also be fused to Cre recombinase to create a Cre\u2013PR fusion protein, which can be induced by the synthetic steroid RU486 [82].",
