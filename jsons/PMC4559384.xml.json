Among them, the addition of high-dose cytarabine (HDCA) to CY/TBI may be promising; in our recent large-scale study, HDCA/CY/TBI significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared to CY/TBI by suppressing relapse without increasing severe adverse events or non-relapse mortality (NRM) in cord blood transplantation (CBT) for AML/MDS [5]. However, previous studies in a small cohort with mixed hematopoietic malignancies showed that HDCA/CY/TBI increased NRM after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) [6, 7]. These results require validation using disease-specified and newer cohorts, in order to reflect the characteristics of each malignancy and the recent progress in supportive therapies, such as antibiotics. Therefore, we performed a cohort study to compare prognosis following HDCA/CY/TBI and CY/TBI in AML/MDS patients who underwent BMT or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), using the Japanese transplant registry database.",

Complete chimerism was achieved in 78.2 % of the CY/TBI group vs 72.6 % of the HDCA/CY/TBI group (p = 0.04). We observed no significant differences in the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD (grades II\u2013IV acute GVHD, 39.3 vs 38.2 %; chronic GVHD 37.5 vs 37.7 %, respectively) (Fig. 2). Hemorrhagic cystitis, mostly due to viral reactivation or infection [11], and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) were more frequently observed in the HDCA/CY/TBI group (HR, 1.47; p = 0.06, and HR, 1.60; p = 0.04, respectively). These two complications were related to a significantly higher proportion of NRM (data not shown). Other potential complications of HDCA, such as central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and acute respiratory dysfunction syndrome (ARDS) [12], were not increased in the HDCA/CY/TBI group.",

These complications, if not resolved early, can induce renal failure, prohibit immune reconstitution, and deteriorate patient\u2019s nutrition and performance status, which may ultimately lead to significantly higher NRM [11, 13]. The strong cytotoxicity of HDCA combined with significantly poorer neutrophil engraftment might cause cystitis-related virus reactivation or vascular endothelial cell injury which can induce hemorrhagic cystitis or TMA. These features were not observed in CBT [5]; the relatively higher incidence of acute GVHD in BMT/PBSCT can explain this difference because both hemorrhagic cystitis and TMA are closely related to preceding acute GVHD [11, 13].",

This anti-leukemic effect of HDCA directly reduced the incidence of relapse in CBT [5] because graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects after CBT was relatively weak [14]; relapse after CBT mainly depends on the efficacy of conditioning regimens [5]. In BMT/PBSCT, however, GVL effects are much stronger than CBT especially in the case of HLA-mismatched transplantation [14]. Suppression of total relapse after HCT is mainly attributed to continuous GVL effects [14] compared to the conditioning regimens which will be inactivated rapidly after HCT [12]; strength of conditioning regimens (for example, HDCA addition in this study) may not directly influence on relapse reduction. These differences in GVL effects can partly explain the discrepancy in the efficacy of HDCA on post-transplant relapse or disease-related death.",
