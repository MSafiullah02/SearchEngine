The network was constructed as a 2-dimensional Watts-Strogatz model (500 \u00d7 500 square lattice with additional shortcuts), and the dynamics involved rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic spread. The model of the epidemic is SIR with latency time of 3 time steps. The behaviour of the epidemic was checked over the range of shortcut probability per underlying bond \u03c6 = 0 \u2212 0.5. The quantity of interest was percolation threshold for the epidemic spread, for which numerical results were checked against an approximate analytical model. We find a significant lowering of percolation thresholds for the dynamic network in the parameter range given. The result shows that the behaviour of the epidemic on dynamic network is that of a static small world with the number of shortcuts increased by 20.7 \u00b1 1.4%, while the overall qualitative behaviour stays the same. We derive corrections to the analytical model which account for the effect. For both dynamic and static small-world we observe suppression of the average epidemic size dependence on network size in comparison with finite-size scaling known for regular lattice. We also study the effect of dynamics for several rewiring rates relative to latency time of the disease. * jeremi.ochab@uj.edu.pl \u2020 Also at Mark Kac Complex Systems Research Centre. 1 nature, and secondly, the contact network of individuals affected by the disease may change in time as the epidemic spreads.

Likewise, in [15] (where focus is on the average epidemic size in time) nodes of the contact network can swap their edges at a given rate, preserving the degree distribution. It is also worth to note [11] , where disease spread was simulated on a weighted contact network produced from real day-to-day encounters (as weights represent the frequency of encounters, the dynamics has been in a sense projected onto static weighted network).",

The probability p of infecting a susceptible node by an infectious neighbour during one time step is set equal for short-and long-range links, both static and dynamic. The latency time l of the disease is measured in discrete time units (we take l = 3, 4). Thus, an infectious node can transmit disease to susceptible nodes with probability p every turn for the period of l turns, and after that time it is removed, i.e. it cannot infect nor be reinfected. Every simulation starts with only one initially infecting node, all others being susceptible, and it ends when no node in the infectious state is left. Sample snapshots of the epidemic time development are presented in Fig.2 . Grassberger [4] related the probability of infection to the probability T in bond percolation through T = l t=1 p(1 \u2212 p) t\u22121 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) l , where T is the so called transmissibility (it is the total probability of a node infecting one of its neighbours during the whole latency time).

In the theory, a percolation threshold would be the value of p that generates an epidemic cluster spanning between the boundaries of the whole system. Otherwise, it is possible to define percolation as the point at which a cluster of macroscopic size forms (i.e. it occupies a finite fraction of the system for N \u2192 \u221e). We employ the latter to define percolation threshold (numerically) as the point at which the average epidemic's size divided by N rises above a certain value (here, set to 0.00115). The average is taken over a number of reruns for different shortcut drawings. As we can perform simulations only for finite sizes, we take the results for a relatively large network of \u221a N = 500. The choice of the threshold value is taken so as to calibrate the results for the static network to the previously confirmed analytical result. We take as the theoretical model [7] , where the generating function and series expansion methods were used to find the approximate position of bond percolation transition in 2D small-world network, which corresponds to the epidemic spread on what we refer to as static small-world.",

This expression predicts lowering percolation thresholds, although numerical values of the shift are considerably smaller than the ones obtained from simulations. Figures 3(a) -3(c) explain why the above expression is not yet correct: it is derived only for the source nodes passing the disease on, while it disregards the fact that the node may itself become infected via long-range link.

For dynamic network, the graphs in Fig.3 (b)-3(c) for infecting a source node through a regular link and through a dynamic link give different counts of how many shortcuts were used.

The resulting T c (\u03c6) data points for static small-world network agree with the analytical approximation [7] , which confirms the validity of calibration procedure. As the lower dataset marks the effect of network dynamics, the difference between the two networks proves to be systematic and significant. The dashed line is a fit T c [(1 + v)\u03c6] of the analytical model for the static network, where the fitted parameter v may be interpreted as a virtual percentage of additional shortcuts needed to obtain the dynamic network percolation thresholds. It follows from the fit that percolation thresholds for dynamic network are lower as if the shortcut density were (1+v)\u03c6 (where v = 0.207 \u00b1 0.014 is the fitted parameter). Nonetheless, qualitatively the epidemic on dynamic small world behaves in the same way as on the static one for the given range of parameters (\u03c6 = 0.5 corresponds to every node in the network having on average two additional links). The analytical correction slightly exceeds the values of simulation data points, but the overall agreement is satisfactory. The difference between the analytical solution and the observed behaviour does not exceed the shift between static and dynamic networks obtained from simulations. The discrepancy might be due to the method of calculating percolation thresholds from numerical data or due to the approximate nature of the correction.",

Yet, it is worth noting at this point that the knowledge of thresholds for infinite system sizes would not usually be appropriate for evaluation of risks in the real epidemic, given the sizes of some real networks. To study the size of finite-size effects is thus vital on its own right. In Figure 5 (b) the convergence of the average epidemic size to the threshold behaviour can be observed, and the significant dependence on system size ranges up to the epidemic size of around 0.5N and interval of transmissibility of length around 0.08 (the numbers are very rough estimates).

The effect remains secondary to the influence that the introduction of additional of shortcuts has on the spread of the disease. It should be noted that the shift of percolation thresholds depends on the relative measure of dynamics of the network with respect to the process on the network (rewiring rate and latency time, respectively).

Transmissibility of the disease is reviewed in [3] , where authors give values ranging from 9.2% to 63% per partner, and decide on 60% as the lower boundary for untreated disease.

Still, it has some other fairly realistic characteristics: according to [11] , who analysed the structure of human social interactions, 'the majority of encounters (76.70%; 75.26-78.07) occur with individuals never again encountered by the participant during the 14 days of the survey.' This may mean that about 24% of the repeated contacts corresponds roughly to our regular underlying lattice with z = 4 neighbours for each node, while the 76% correspond to around 3z dynamic contacts distributed over over 14 days.
