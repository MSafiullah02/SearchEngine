One strand of the double-stranded siRNA, termed the guide strand, is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex for targeting to the corresponding mRNA. siRNAs and miRNAs are both processed through this pathway and bind to target mRNA through an eight-nucleotide seed region, but with different end results.",

CRISPR was originally discovered in bacteria, where it provides immunity against bacterial viruses by disrupting viral transcription (Barrangou et al., 2007). Genome-editing strategies using CRISPR take advantage of bacterial Cas9, an enzyme that catalyzes double-stranded DNA breaks, to specifically target and create deletions in the exons of a desired gene. CRISPR functions through the base pairing of a guide RNA (gRNA) to a specified genomic location. The gRNA directs Cas9 to the target sequence where it induces a double-strand break, leading to a sequence deletion or insertion. Unlike siRNA and shRNA, which can result in an incomplete knockdown of the target gene, CRISPR permanently edits the genome and can result in the complete knockout of a gene.",

This method was used in a screen to identify host factors involved in influenza virus replication (Konig et al., 2010).

This method was also used to identify host factors required for influenza virus replication (Brass et al., 2009). Cells were transfected with siRNA pools, and after influenza virus infection, the cells were immunostained for the presence of HA, which was used as a surrogate for viral replication (Figure 2\n). Nearly 150 host antiviral genes were identified as potential targets after validation assays. This loss-of-function screen identified an important family of host restriction factors, call the IFITM (interferon-inducible transmembrane) proteins, which potently inhibit the replication of influenza virus, West Nile virus, and Dengue virus. IFITM3 was later confirmed as a broad-acting restriction factor through a gain-of-function screen using a curated list of ISGs (Schoggins et al., 2011).",

These pathways converge on NF-\u03baB, IRF3, and IFN-\u03b2 transcription, and binding sites for these transcription factors can be attached to a luciferase reporter gene so that activation of the signaling pathway can be quantified.

Alternatively, the reporter gene may code for a lethal gene, such that a physical interaction results in a reduction in colony size. Although two-hybrid approaches are typically performed using yeast, these assays have also been adapted to bacterial and mammalian systems (Joung et al., 2000). The disadvantages of two-hybrid approaches are that they often have high false-positive and false-negative rates. Producing proteins at far higher abundance than is biologically relevant can lead to spurious interactions that elevate the false-positive rate.

Cells are transfected with siRNA pools, and after infection with wild-type influenza virus (PR8), influenza virus with a deletion in the host immune inhibiting NS1 gene, or wild-type virus in the presence of IFN-\u03b2, cells are immunostained for hemagglutinin (HA). HA, which is an influenza-encoded protein that can be used as a surrogate measure of viral replication levels, is quantified using imaging technologies after RNAi treatments. Inhibition of viral replication after gene depletion reveals host factors that are required by the virus for replication. Prior stimulation with interferon enables an understanding of the virus\u2013host interaction in cells that are in a preexisting antiviral state. The heat map reflects potential effects of knockdown of individual genes on the replication levels of wild-type influenza virus; influenza virus with a deletion in the NS1 gene; or wild-type influenza in cells pretreated with IFN-\u03b2.",
