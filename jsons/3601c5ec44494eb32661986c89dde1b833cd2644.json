            "text": "system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary 28 human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. 29 We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally 30 released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies 31 found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-32 inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNF\u03b1, CXCL8. We 33 also identified NF-\u03baB and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-34 inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I 35 or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with 36 type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this 37 corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate 38 that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the 39 production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type 40 I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-41 19 patients. 44 The current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently 45 emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells 46 causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can 47 result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently 48 no vaccines or antivirals approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of 49 SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human 50 airway epithelial cultures induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet 51 blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the 52 effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options 53 to treat COVID-19 patients. 55 In December 2019, a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, 56 China, causing an outbreak of severe respiratory disease (1, 2). In the span of several 57 months, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly escalated to a pandemic, with over 4 million infections 58 and 275,000 deaths worldwide (3). There are currently no vaccines or antivirals 59 approved for use in humans that can prevent or treat the infection. SARS-CoV-2 60 infection manifests as an upper and lower respiratory disease (named COVID-19 by the 61 World Health Organization), characterized by fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. 62 SARS-CoV-2 targets lower respiratory tract cells, with one study finding 93% of their 63 patients' bronchial lavages were qRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 (4). 64 Correspondingly, lung abnormalities have been observed in several patients with 65 COVID-19, and severe infection can lead to respiratory failure and lung tissue 66 destruction (5). Severe disease has also been associated with a low level of 67 lymphocytes in the blood and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 68 and TNF-\u03b1 (6). How the host innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection 69 is not well understood. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29.8 kb in length and predicted to contain 12 open reading 72 frames. This includes 15 putative non-structural proteins, envelope and capsid genes, 73 an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), and a spike protein (7, 8). SARS-CoV-2 74 virus is closely related to the \u03b2-coronavirus SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of 75 acute respiratory distress syndrome in China in 2003 (9). \u03b2-coronaviruses use the spike 76 protein receptor-binding domain to gain entry to target cells, and recent studies have 77 found that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilize the same receptor, ACE-2 (10). SARS-78 CoV-2 entry was also found to require the expression of the cellular protease, 79 TMPRSS2 (10). ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in epithelial tissue from the lung 80 and gut, with the highest expression in ciliated cells from the nasal cavity (11) In this study, we seek to address some of these unanswered questions about the innate 100 immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 infects and 101 replicates in pHAE cultures and is released exclusively from the apical surface. We 102 performed transcriptional profiling and found that infection triggers a robust 103 inflammatory cytokine response characterized by the induction of IL-6, CXCL8, TNF-\u03b1, 104 and IL-1 family cytokines. In contrast, we observed a lack of induction of type I IFN and 105 IFN-stimulated genes despite the expression of both type I and III IFN receptors. We ",

            "text": "To understand the response of airway epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we 114 utilized pHAE cultures isolated from the bronchial or tracheal region. These cells were 115 cultured using an air-liquid interface model to create a polarized, pseudostratified 116 epithelial layer. This culture system excellently re-capitulates the unique features of the 117 human respiratory tract, including mucus production and coordinated cilia movement 118 (16). pHAE cultures were infected on the apical side with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 119 and 0.25 (as determined on VeroE6 cells). In our study, we used a low cell culture-120 passaged and sequence-verified SARS-CoV-2 strain, nCoV2019/WA, which was 121 isolated in January 2020 from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens 122 collected three days post-symptom onset (17). Using two different measurements, we 123 demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures. On the apical 124 surface, we detected infectious SARS-CoV-2 beginning 24 hours post-infection (p.i.) 125 and increased through 48 hours p.i. as measured by plaque assay (Fig. 1A) . In 126 contrast, we were unable to detect infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus on the basolateral side 127 at any timepoint or MOI, suggesting the directional release of the virus from pHAE 128 cultures. Next, we confirmed the presence of viral RNA in the cells by qRT-PCR with 129 primer/probes that anneal to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 130 (RDRP). We observed an increase in viral RNA between MOI 0.1 and 0.25 at 48 hours 131 p.i. (Fig. 1B) . Combined, these findings demonstrate that pHAE cultures are permissive 132 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 135 We next evaluated the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, 136 we performed bulk mRNA-sequencing analysis on differentiated pHAE cultures infected 137 with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI= 0.25) at 48 hours p.i. Following infection, we observed 1,039 138 differentially expressed genes (DEG) (P < 0.01; 1.5-fold change cut-off), with 458 139 upregulated ( Fig. 2A in red) and 581 downregulated ( Fig. 2A in blue) DEGs. We 140 detected viral transcripts spanning most of the viral genome, although there was minor 141 variation between the three replicates ( Fig 2B) . Table 2 ). This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not alter mucus and 160 AMP production in pHAE cultures. (22). Accordingly, GSEA also revealed enrichment 180 of genes associated with the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal tissue (Fig. 3F) . 181 Overall, the transcriptional profiling of infected pHAE cultures revealed that the normal 182 homeostatic functions are disrupted and they induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype 183 characterized by NF-\u03baB signaling, ER stress response and IL-6 production. (Fig. 4E) (Fig. 5A) . As compared to untreated cells, we observed significantly reduced viral 214 RNA in type I (3-fold less) and III (3-fold less) IFN treated cells by 24 hours p.i. (Fig.   215   5B) . We next evaluated infectious virus release and found that pHAE cultures pre-216 treated with type I or III IFNs significantly reduced (14-fold and 12-fold respectively) 217 SARS-CoV-2 viral burden by 24 hours p.i., resulting in greater than 90% reduction in 218 virus replication as compared to untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Fig. 5C) . the IFIT family of antiviral effector genes (Fig. 5D) . Changes in transcription factors 225 were also observed with increases in IRF-7 and to a lesser extent IRF-1. Treatment with 226 type I and III IFNs upregulated ISGs regardless of infection status, but SARS-CoV-2 227 infected samples had larger fold changes compared to mock-infected cells. In SARS-228 CoV-2 infected samples, treatment with type I IFN induced higher expression of certain 229 ISGs (IFIH1, IFIT2) than type III IFN (Fig. 5D) . These findings demonstrate that pre- CoV-2 (MOI= 0.5) and, at 24 hours p.i., we treated the basolateral side with IFN\u03b21 or 237 IFN\u03bb1 (100 IU/mL). Infectious virus release was measured before and after treatment 238 (Fig. 6A) . Twenty-four hours after treatment (48 hours p.i.) there was no significant 239 difference in viral burden between treatments. However, by 72 hours p.i., treatment with 240 both type I and III IFN had reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels 50-fold compared to 241 untreated samples, resulting in a 98% reduction in viral burden at 72 hours p.i. (Fig.   242 6A). Analysis of RNA at 72 hours p.i. confirmed that both IFN\u03b21 and IFN\u03bb1 treatment 243 reduced viral RNA compared to untreated cells, 12-fold and 20-fold, respectively (Fig.   244   6B) . Similarly, to our pre-treated samples (Fig. 5) , treatment after infection with type I 245 or III IFNs upregulated ISGs, such as RIG-I, MDA5, and IFIT family members, 246 compared to untreated (Fig. 6C) In this study, we found that human pHAE cultures, which model the air-liquid interface of ",

NF-\u03baB regulates a substantial 168 portion of the DEGs, with a network of 312 DEGs. This network includes some of the 169 top upregulated genes, such as IL-6 and CXCL8.

The identification of NF-172 \u03baB as a key transcriptional node is consistent with our observations that SARS-CoV-2 173 triggers cytokine induction. ATF-4 is associated with the promotion of a cellular stress 174 response. Thus, we used GSEA to investigate if ATF4 corresponds to an enrichment of 175 cellular stress pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (21).

In both mock and SARS-CoV-2 191 infected samples, there was no detectable IFN\u03b1 of any subtype, and low induction of 192 IFN\u03b21 and IFN\u03bb1, with normalized read counts less than 10 (Fig. 4A). Next, we 193 determined whether this was due to the lack of expression of molecules required for the 194 induction of IFN transcription, such as the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. We 195 found that several genes within this pathway, including RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, TRAF6, 196 IRF-3, and IRF-7 are expressed at baseline but show little to no induction in response to 197 SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4B; highlighted in green; Supplementary Table 4). 198 199 We observed little to no change in expression for several genes related to type I IFN 200 signaling, including transcription factors and antiviral effector genes, such as IFIT2, 201 IFIT3, IFITM1, OAS1 and MX1 (Fig. 4C-D; highlighted in pink; SupplementaryTable 202 5). We next evaluated the expression of both the type I IFN (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and 203 type III IFN (IFNLR1 and IL10R\u03b2) receptors. At the transcript level, the type I and III IFN 204 receptors are present in pHAE cultures, but the expression of these receptors does not 205 change with infection",

Transcriptional profiling revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infected255    pHAE cultures trigger a pro-inflammatory response driven by analysis also suggested that the normal cellular functions of pHAE cultures were 257 disrupted during SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evidenced by the enrichment of ER stress 258 pathways. Despite having a baseline expression of viral sensing pathway components,259    pHAE cultures did not produce type I or III IFN in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,260    and there was little to no induction of antiviral effector genes. However, pHAE cultures 261 are sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFN, as pre-treatment with exogenous IFN 262 was able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden significantly. Therapeutic administration of 263 type I and III IFNs was also effective at restricting viral replication, and induced 264 upregulation of ISGs in pHAE cultures. Thus, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 is 265 susceptible to both type I and type III IFN, and identifying them as potential expression of molecules such as RIG-I, MDA5, IRF-3 and IRF-7 in pHAE 269 cultures suggests that these cells are capable of producing type I and III IFN. In other 270 models of viral infection, pHAE cultures produce a robust IFN response(14, 23).271    Previous studies with SARS-CoV, showed that it is able to block the production of typeI 272 IFN, by inhibiting the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, and interfering 273 with STAT signaling (24-29). However, studies of both in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV 274 infection found that delayed production of type I IFN did occur eventually (30, 31). did not produce IFN in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, 280 SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to the effects of both type I and III IFNs, resulting in reduced 281 viral burden concomitant with an upregulation of ISGs. Lung epithelial cells are highly 282 polarized, and often have differential localization of receptors, such as ACE-2, on the 283 apical vs basolateral side (32). Thus, an interesting follow-up study would be to 284 compare the differential effects of cytokine application to the apical side. While the 285 reduction in viral load was similar between both IFNs, type I IFN was able to induce 286 higher expression than type III IFN (~ 2-fold) of most ISGs in pre-treated pHAE cultures. 287 However, in our post-treated samples, this difference disappeared. Studies of the 288 differential effect of type I and III IFN in other viral infection models have shown 289 differences in both magnitude and timing of ISG and IRF transcription factor expression. 290 Type I IFN responses often peak early then decline sharply, while type III IFN 291 responses take longer to initiate and are more sustained (14, 15). Detailed analysis of 292 the transcriptional response to type I and III IFNs noted these differences are driven 293 largely by IRF-1 (33). Correspondingly, we did see higher induction of IRF-1 in type I 294 IFN treated pHAE cultures compared to type III, during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, 295 while type I and III IFNs have similar effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication, type III IFN 296 might have a more localized, less inflammatory effect on the immune response. 297 Dissecting the signaling pathways of type I and type III IFN could provide a clearer 298 understanding of the innate immune response in airway epithelial cells and , which will promote localized edema, fever, and the recruitment 303 of immune cells into the lung. Many of the cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, 304 such as CXCL6, CXCL8 and CXCL5 are chemotactic factors that primarily recruit 305 neutrophils (34). However, the recruitment of neutrophils may be of limited use in 306 controlling SARS-CoV-2, as neutrophils are not particularly effective against intracellular 307 pathogens, and have been associated with poor prognosis in other models of 308 respiratory disease (35). Several cytokines primarily associated with a T H 17 response 309 (IL-23, IL-17) were also highly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAE cultures. 310 While T H 17 cells are important for barrier immunity, they are most potent against 311 extracellular pathogens, and have the potential to cause chronic inflammation (36). IL-6, 312 neutrophil infiltration, and T H 17 immunity have all been previously implicated in the 313 development of fibrotic tissue in the lung (37). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAE 314 cultures were highly enriched in genes associated with the unfolded protein response 315 and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which are both pathways directly linked to 316 the formation of fibrotic tissue (38-40). The RNA-Seq data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 317may be producing a sub-optimal immune response in pHAE cultures, as evidenced by a 318 preference for the production of cytokines whose primary function is in the defense 319 against extracellular pathogens, and the complete lack of type I and III IFN signaling.320    Furthermore, this dysregulated immune response combined with an increase in ER 321 stress may be promoting the formation of fibrotic epithelial tissue during SARSstudy, we characterized the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection327    using an in vitro model of the air-lung epithelial barrier. We found that pHAE cultures are 328 permissive to SARS-CoV-2, but mount a weak innate antiviral response, that is notably 329 lacking type I and III IFN production, signaling, and induction of ISGs. Instead, the330 innate immune response signature of infected pHAEs is dominated by pro-inflammatory 331 cytokines and chemokines that will recruit neutrophils and monocytes. Most importantly, 332 therapeutic treatment of pHAE cultures with type I and III IFNs are able to reduce 333 SARS-CoV-2 viral burden. Overall, these data suggest that pHAE cultures mount a 334 misdirected innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the early 335 administration of type I or III IFN could potentially decrease virus replication case in the US (17).

Consistently, previous studies have shown that SARS infects and replicates in primary Type I IFN is the first line of defense and is critical for blocking early virus replication, 86 spread, and tropism as well as promoting the adaptive immune response. Type I IFN 87 induces a systemic response that impacts nearly every cell in the host, while type III IFNs are restricted to anatomic barriers and select immune cells (13). This selectivity is 89 due to the receptor expression patterns: type I IFN binds IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which 90 are ubiquitously expressed. In contrast, type III IFN binds IFNLR1 and IL10-R\u03b2, which 91 are expressed preferentially on epithelial cells (13). Despite using different receptors, Type I and III IFNs use similar downstream signaling complex (ISGF3) and induce 93 similar gene expression profiles.
