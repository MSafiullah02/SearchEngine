            "text": "The mucosal protective barrier is a feature of higher animals and has been developed and maintained throughout evolution [1,2]. The family of mucus glycoproteins, the mucins, are an integral part of this barrier and also feature throughout evolution [3,4]. A principal character of the mucins is their glycosylation, a high proportion of their molecular weight consists of carbohydrate in the form of oligosaccharides, or glycan chains [5,6,7,8]. The glycans are made up of a sequence of monosaccharides and are biosynthesized and degraded by enzymes that recognize the glycan structures and their linkages. The sequences generated and expressed are known and predictable, due to their mode of synthesis. They form a glycocode [9] where the sequence is recognized by proteins that play a role in mucosal protection, resident and pathogenic microorganisms, transient food borne bacteria interactions, and innate and adaptive immune responses [10]. This glycocode is species and tissue specific and is closely linked to the microbiota associated with individual mucosal surfaces [10,11,12]. The expression of the mucins in the mucosal defensive barrier is dynamic and is known to adapt to mucosal changes, in order to maintain optimal protection. A number of diseases have been identified which relate to aberrant glycosylation of the mucins and have been used as biomarkers for these pathological conditions [13,14,15]. The known diseases include genetic based abnormalities [16,17] in addition to tissue specific and environmentally effected changes which would influence mucins and lead to mucus which does not function effectively and results in reduced mucosal protection and the appearance of pathological features [7,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26].",

In addition, the intestine is well innervated and the enteric nervous system mediates gut motility, fluid exchange, blood flow, secretion, and barrier permeability through paracrine processes, while juxtacrine mechanisms occur via cell-cell contacts formed at the gap junctions. Both of these mechanisms are calcium dependent.",

Recent work has emphasized the range of Goblet cells found in the GI tract, together with specific functions relating to the mode of mucus secretion [28,29,30,31]. The function of the Goblet cells varies depending on their location in the small intestinal or colorectal crypts. The identification of a \u201csentinel\u201d Goblet cell at the mouth of colonic crypts serves to underline the concept that Goblet cells vary depending on their intestinal location [32]. The number of vesicles found in these cells, together with the release of mucus into the crypt lumen is mediated to ensure channeled release and formation of mucus fibrils. This has recently been demonstrated in the lung for MUC5B [33,34] and is assumed to function in a similar manner in the gut with MUC2. The mucus product found at mucosal surfaces throughout the body is derived from the gel-forming mucins and is well recognized as part of the mucosal barrier with a characteristic thickness. The mucus thickness in the GI tract has been extensively analyzed and reported [35,36].",

The observations in this case show no evidence for an adherent mucosal gel layer where fecal content is present. Instead mucus is attached to the fecal pellet and is absent from the surface of the epithelium. A functional role for the mucus, as proposed in the two-layer model, would therefore be redundant.",

            "text": "The family of mucin genes currently includes 21 members. Their macromolecular structure is organized through disulfide bridges and some of the mucins also contain isopeptide linkages. They have been divided into two basic groups on the basis of their biological functions, secreted mucins and the membrane-associated mucins. The secreted members include the gel-forming mucins, important for mucus barrier formation at mucosal surfaces, and also secreted, non-gel forming mucins. The membrane-associated mucins are essentially components of the cell-surface glycocalyx and it is here that their glycans contribute to the carbohydrate rich surface involved in many interactions between cells and the external environment. Those mucins commonly found in the gut include the gel-forming mucins MUC2 (jejunum, ileum, and colon), MUC5AC (stomach), MUC5B (in submandibular and other salivary glands), MUC6 (stomach and ileum) and the non-gel forming mucin MUC7 (sublingual and submandibular glands). Membrane-associated mucins in the gut include MUC1, MUC3A/B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC13, MUC15, MUC17, MUC20, and MUC21. Each mucin has a typical protein domain structure which correlates with their secreted or membrane-associated nature. More information on the individual mucins can be found in the literature [6,8,38,39,40,41,42,43]. The major feature of all mucins is the proline-threonine-serine (PTS) rich domain, which contains the serine and threonine residues that form the glycosidic links to GalNAc, the first monosaccharide in the O-linked glycan chains, typical of mucins. The PTS domains are expressed as tandem repeats, thus generating a domain, which carries a large number of glycans. The size and pattern of these PTS domains varies between mucins. The main features of these molecules are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.",

It has been reported that the glycosylation of milk proteins varies during lactation, this has been shown for the major family of milk glycoproteins, the caseins in both man and cow [99,100] and also for human milk lactoferrin [101,102]. In keeping with this concept, the pattern of low molecular weight oligosaccharides present in mothers-milk is known to change during lactation [103,104]. The oligosaccharides are thought to play a role as prebiotics, as inhibitors of pathogenic or detrimental bacterial binding to the developing gut mucosa and in order to promote colonization of beneficial stains and to establish a normal flora [105,106,107,108,109].",

These are the characteristics that contribute to the barrier function of the secreted mucus and are evident in the mucus layers found in the GI tract. The secreted mucins form viscoelastic gels through generation of molecular networks. The gel forming mucins display rheological properties through bulk mucus flow. They are both viscous and elastic, fundamental properties due to covalent and reversible interactions, mediated by the concentration of the gel forming mucins themselves, environmental salt concentration, and local pH [125]. Mucin rheology should be regarded as a fundamental physiological property of mucins reflecting selective molecular design throughout evolution [126,127,128]. Recently the biological importance of the GI mucus barrier as a two-layer system, initially described by the Allen group [35,129], has been demonstrated to comprise an inner, adherent gel on the surface of the mucosa, which is devoid of enteric bacteria, and an outer, thicker layer, that is constantly being degraded and shed, but which harbors a bacterial population [130,131,132,133].",

Recent analysis has implicated the link to either serine or threonine as a selective process with biological significance. Comparison of serine-linked versus threonine-linked mucin O-glycans shows different properties in their interaction with lectins, implying a potential for different functions based on the type of O-glycan linkage. [137]. The linkage sugar is N-Acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) and, as noted below, the transfer of this initial sugar is catalyzed by a family of N-acetyl-d-Galactosaminyltransferases, which show specificity with regard to the mucin peptide sequence, including the proximity of other ser/thr attachment sites and whether they are already substituted by a GalNAc residue. The chemical and biochemical complexity of this glycosylation step emphasizes the biological importance of this initial event and coordinates the mucin for its physiological role at its site of biosynthesis and secretion [138,139,140].",

The cores are extended to create the series of N-glycans found in nature and accordingly in the mucins. Different numbers of antennae are known, bisecting GlcNAc is also present in certain cases and an internal fucose, attached to the GlcNAc linked to asparagine also occurs. Oligo-mannose forms, and complex forms terminated with a sialyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine trisaccharide and hybrid forms are common (see Figure 1). As with the O-glycans, noted above, the N-glycans possess a variety of different peripheral substitutions, leading to the profusion of N-glycans that have been detected and reported in glycoproteins.

It has been proposed that these units function in protein folding, subcellular localization and trafficking [149,150]. C-mannosylation in MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B is required for maturation and secretion.

The defensive processes necessary will depend on the mucosal surface in question and this fits well with the opportunity to biosynthesize mucin glycan sequences, which are adapted to the needs of each mucosal surface. It is known that the glycobiome, which has the ability to glycosylate individual proteins to yield distinct and discrete glycoforms, will have ideal function at their site of synthesis [5]. A good example is the glycosylation of MUC2 in the human GI tract. Regional patterns of MUC2 glycosylation occur from the small intestine through to the rectum, largely through sialylation and glycosulphation [162,163]. These patterns were constant when examined in more than 50 normal individuals [164] and in patients with ulcerative colitis, where aberrant mucin glycosylation is associated with the disease, recovery is accompanied with a return to the normal healthy glycosylation profile. In addition to the GI tract, characteristic mucin glycosylation profiles have been found in the oral cavity [165], the pancreas [166], the ocular surface and conjunctiva [155,167], the respiratory tract [168], human sperm [169], and the female reproductive tract [170].",

The human blood group system is well known to rely on glycan sequences for its recognition [171,172,173]. The human blood groups found on proteins include the ABO(H) antigens, the Lewis antigens [174], the Sda antigen [175,176], and the i and I blood groups [177]. Much of the immunochemistry was established through the work of Karl Landsteiner [178], Elvin Kabat [179], Walter Morgan, and Winifred Watkins [172]. The development and conservation of the human blood group system has been confirmed through evolutionary study [180] and serves to emphasize the biological relevance and magnitude of this recognition system. These structures are carried on glycan chains of type 1 (Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc), common in O-glycans, or type 2 (Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc), mostly found in N-glycans and type 3 (\u03b21-3 GalNAc-\u03b1ser/thr-) associated with mucins. Some of the key glycan structures are shown in Table 5.",

However, the expression of the same structures on mucosal glycoproteins is regulated through the glycosyltransferase FUT2, also known as the secretor gene. Individuals who have this fucosyltransferase transfer fucose to glycoproteins to give a \u03b11-2 linkage [181,182]. These individuals are able to express blood group antigens on mucosal surfaces and are termed secretors. In contrast, those who have no FUT2 gene do not show the blood group antigens on their cellular glycoproteins and are known as non-secretors [181,183]. In addition to the molecular identification specified by the FUT2 gene it is also directly related to disease and is known to mediate infection and susceptibility [183,184]. The ABO blood group antigens expressed on erythrocytes (red cells) have been shown to modulate the pattern and arrangement of sialylated glycans on the erythrocyte surface [185]. A further feature of blood group activity and secretor status has been demonstrated for salivary MUC5B. The non-secretors had a higher sialylated form of MUC5B, with increased sialyl-Lewisa, compared with the secretors [186]. Thus demonstrating that mucin glycosylation depends on both blood group and secretor status.",

The stomach and colon have a gel layer of about 700 \u00b5m, while the small intestinal thickness ranger between 150 and 300 \u00b5m [6,35,36]. The colonic barrier consists of two secreted mucus layers; these are essentially composed of MUC2. A major feature of these two layers is the distribution of bacterial populations. The inner, adherent secreted mucus is free of microbes, while the outer layer is colonized by the enteric gut bacterial flora. The sophistication of this system is apparent with the identification of different types of Goblet cells, which synthesize and secrete the mucus along the crypt in the human colon. Indeed a \u201csentinel\u201d Goblet cell has been identified, positioned at the top of each colonic crypt. Endocytosis of TLR generates MUC2 secretion, together with an intercellular gap junction signal, which induces MUC2 secretion in adjacent Goblet cells and thus regulates the entry of bacteria into the crypt [28,32].",

The techniques best suited to and most widely used in glycan isolation, detection, and assessment are Affinity Chromatography, which employs an immobilized binding protein on a suitable support such as Affi-Gel or Sepharose [206,207,208]. This can be used simply to bind the target glycan and separate it from all other compounds in a tissue or cell preparation. It can also be used to calculate the strength of binding and generate a kd value when compared with a glycan not bound by the protein. The strength of binding can also be calculated using isothermal titration calorimetry [209,210]. The change in enthalpy is measured, in a microcalorimeter, for varying concentrations of the glycan at constant glycan binding protein concentration, and used to calculate the kd value. Surface plasmon resonance has also been widely adopted to follow the kinetics of reaction and relies on the reflection of polarized light as the glycan is allowed to flow over the immobilized glycan binding protein [211,212]. Again values for the kd of the reaction can be obtained. Fluorescence polarization techniques also allow measurement of kd values. Characterization of non-covalent interactions between glycans and specific proteins can be measured using mass spectrometric and NMR methods.",

Viral proteins that show hemagglutinin binding properties and those that have specific esterase activity for 4-O-acetylated sialic acids have been reported [238]. Recently a series of virolectins from nidovirus strains have been isolated and used to probe for O-acetylated sialic acids [239]. Dual function hemagglutinin-esterase envelope proteins were found to show very selective, differential binding patterns when used in soluble form. Discrimination between 4-O-Ac, 9-O-Ac, 7,9-diOAc, and 4,9-diOAc was possible and differential expression was revealed in human and mouse tissue arrays. This shows a pattern of sialic acid O-acetylation, which is programmed, exists at an organ, tissue, and cellular level and implicates O-acetylated sialic acids in cell development, homeostasis, and other functions [239].

Of particular interest are those arrays that correlate mucin glycan epitopes with bacterial binding [254,255,256,257,258,259]. Although a considerable range of glycans can be displayed and screened using this technique the conformation of the glycans on the surface of the chips remains a problem. Attachment of individual glycans can be achieved using a number of different methods and on different chip surfaces, see previous papers [244,245,247,249,252,253,255,260,261,262,263,264,265], however, this does not necessarily achieve the molecular conformation found in vivo when attached to proteins. Some improvements have been made using known glycans attached to peptides, where the normal in vivo conformation is more likely to be preserved [266,267,268]. A further problem is the density of attachment, which may not mirror the in vivo situation. Single glycan attachment, or clustered glycan attachment must conform with the biological arrangement in order to yield binding results that have genuine in vivo relevance [269]. Attempts have been made to address clustering, which is a feature of mucin O-glycans in the tandem repeat PTS domains of the mucins [250,270], but an array of O-glycans as found in mucins remains difficult to mimic. In spite of these problems, valuable information has been gleaned from glycan array screening.",

            "text": "As mucins represent a primary target for bacteria in the GI tract and other mucosal surfaces the production of a mucin microarray has been adopted for rapid throughput screening purposes [170,258,271,272]. Preparation of such mucin arrays relies on the prior purification of mucins from appropriate sources. As noted earlier, the preparation of mucins is demanding due to their high molecular weight and separation from other contaminant proteins, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. The available sources are also limited as many normal human mucosal tissues or their secretions cannot be obtained for ethical reasons and disease tissue will deliver abnormal mucin products. The use of cell culture is also dependent on the nature of the mucins produced by the cells. Most cell lines that produce and secrete mucins are cancer derived and as a result yield products that are also influenced by mutations and other cancer related changes including glycosylation. Finally, the attachment of mucins to the microarray plates will result in multiple attachment sites [258] and the conformation of the attached mucin is unlikely to mimic the in vivo situation, although no imaging studies have been reported. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has provided images of purified mucins [273,274,275], but these also do not provide an ideal match for the in vivo mucins at mucosal surfaces. Force microscopy has been used for screening glycans structures. A range of different microscopic techniques have evolved and used to monitor glycans in various molecules including the mucins. This is an area where microscope design has driven the sensitivity and resolution of molecular imaging as well as yielding values for binding affinities [273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280].",

Firstly, the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing methodology [282,283] has been used to the cell-specific delivery of the asialoglycoprotein receptor to hepatic cells [284]. The binding of the receptor to the cell surface, uptake through endocytosis, endosomal escape through endosome acidification and subsequent nuclear import has been achieved [284] and illustrates the power of this technology for application to mucosal surfaces. Secondly, the process of 3D bioprinting is being used in a variety of situations [285,286,287,288,289,290,291] and is an obvious target for mucosal surface bioengineering strategies. Significant interest in the pharmaceutical industry and development for high throughput screening bodes well for expansion of this technology in glycomics.",

This is carried out though the action of glycohydrolases from the enteric micrbiota [307,308,309,310]. As the hydrolytic process is sequential and the O-glycans are covalently attached to the mucin peptide, the peripheral residues are the first targets for the glycohydrolases. The removal of sialic acids, fucose, and glycosulphate is necessary before the main O-glycan chains can be degraded. The complement of glycohydrolases required must cleave the different glycosidic linkages present for sialic acids (\u03b12-3, \u03b12-6 and \u03b12-8/9), and fucose (\u03b11-2, \u03b11-3, \u03b11-4 and \u03b11-6). In addition, the sialic acids in the intestinal mucins are O-acetylated and the action of sialidases may be blocked by this modification, necessitating the action of an esterase prior to effective sialidase action. The same situation exists for the removal of fucose, attached through different glycosidic linkages to different sugars, therefore needing \u03b1-fucosidases with a range of specificities. In secretor individuals, where the blood group antigens are carried on the O-glycans these must also be removed before the remaining backbone and core structures can be degraded. Accordingly, \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and \u03b11-2 fucosidase are required to degrade A antigen and \u03b2-galactosidase and \u03b11-2 fucosidase for B antigen. In H (O) individuals the \u03b11-2 fucosidase is necessary.",

            "text": "Glycosulphate is often missed in analysis of glycohydrolases, but is a major chemical feature of gastrointestinal mucin O-glycans [98,162,163] and mucin specific glycosulphatases have been identified and measured [311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319]. Once the peripheral monosaccharides have been removed the remainder of the O-glycan chains can be hydrolyzed by the action of \u03b2-galactosidases and \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidases. The range of enzymes includes \u03b2-galactosidases specific for both \u03b21-3 and \u03b21-4 galactosides and N-acetylglucosaminidases cleaving \u03b21-3 and \u03b21-4 linkages in type 1 and 2 N-acetyllactosamine units. A \u03b21-4 N-acetylgalactosaminidase will act on the Sda antigen, after the \u03b12-3 Neu5Ac has been removed, and a specific \u03b1 N-acetylgalactosaminidase removes the GalNAc attached to the mucin peptide ser/thr residues. The sequence of degradation is significant as most of the glycohydrolases described above act only on certain O-glycan structures. The Sda antigen is a good example, where the sialic acid must be removed before the \u03b21-4 N-acetylgalactosamine can be released. This sequential strategy is analogous to the biosynthetic formation of the O-glycans and underlines the \u201creading\u201d aspect of the sugar codes carried by the mucins. Thus, the absence of certain glycohydrolase activities will mean that incomplete degradation of the O-glycan may occur, leaving structures \u201cavailable\u201d for recognition by any of the glycan binding proteins that may be in the environment and possibly leading to events that will influence mucosal surface interactions and function. Recent work has highlighted the flexibility of mucin O-glycan degradation through a variety of metabolic pathways [197,320].",

Together these caveats make comparison with the human gut difficult and unpredictable.

In cases where patients have gastrointestinal disease the surgeons opt to isolate the colon from the normal faecal flow. This has been termed faecal diversion [341,342,343]. Only one of the hospitals where this procedure is used has examined the mucosal glycobiology. The Department of Surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary has designed such an experiment. Tissue and biopsy samples were taken from the colon at the initial operation when the faecal flow was isolated and subsequently at the second operation to reestablish the normal faecal flow. Samples were taken from normal mucosa, close to the anastomosis site at each operation. In total 58 patients with no diversion and 49 with diversion were studied, of these 30 non-diverted and 17 diverted had ulcerative colitis (UC); 9 non-diverted and 17 diverted had Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD) and 19 non-diverted and 15 diverted had non-IBD disease. All of the patients in the study gave written permission for the samples to be taken and used for research. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and ethical approval for all experiments was gained from the United Bristol Hospital Trust Ethics Committee.",

More specific reagents need to be used for screening and here the choice is much larger. Ideally an array approach is required and this is the current mode of study, with array technology using lectins [371,372,373] and antibodies [212,374,375,376].

The tip of type 1 pili have FimH, which binds to mannose on host cell surfaces [414,415]. These are tissue specific and while the large intestinal FimH binds to monomannosylated glycans, the FimH in the urinary tract bind to oligomannose host glycans [416]. Glycan analogues have been used therapeutically to block E. coli binding and infection [417,418]. Other E. coli adhesins include PapG, which binds to the disaccharide Gal\u03b11-4Gal [419] and UclD, which binds to O-glycans on large intestinal mucosal cells. Treatment of the cells with an O-glycosidase abolished the binding, but the glycan receptor structures have not yet been identified [420].",

However, the ability to degrade mucins is strain specific [423]. R. gnavus ATCC 35,913 has a Nan cluster, including an intramolecular trans-sialidase, RgNanH, which contains a GH33 catalytic domain and a sialic acid-binding CBM40. It releases sialic acids from substrates as 2,7-anyhydro-Neu5Ac and is able to grow with this product as a sole carbon source [308]. In addition, it codes for \u03b1-galactosidase, which can degrade the B-antigen [424,425]. IBD is associated with a 4-fold increase in R. gnavus and a 100 fold increase in Ruminococcus torques in both UC and CD [426,427]. There is also evidence that this occurs in infant disease [428]. R. gnavus E1 influences the expression of colonic glycoconjugates, probably including mucins, in mucosal Goblet cells. R. gnavus E1 induces individual mRNAs for mucins including MUC2 and also for glycosyltransferases in both mice and HT-29-MTX cells through the action of a soluble, heat stable, low molecular-weight (<3 kDa) peptide [429]. It is clear that Ruminococcus spp. in the gut have a major role in mucin metabolism.",

The resulting contact between the luminal bacteria and the mucosal cells triggers an inflammatory response characteristic of the diseases. The aetiology remains unknown, although proposals have been made that those individuals that are genetically susceptible generate an abnormal immune reaction to the resident microbiota [445,446]. Much effort has been made to identify the genetic nature of these individuals and over 150 IBD genetic susceptibility loci have been identified of which 70% are shared by UC and CD patients [447]. IBDs are multifactorial diseases because of the range of factors, which normally contribute to the formation and maintenance of the mucosal defensive barrier. Defects in one or more of these factors can therefore lead to a general effect where bacterial contact with the mucosal cells occurs and inflammation is triggered. The loss of the mucus layer in murine colitis has been shown to enable bacteria to penetrate the remaining aberrant, gel barrier and contact the mucosal cells, leading to the characteristic inflammatory responses [448].",

As already detailed before, the glycosylation of the intestinal mucins is characterized by relatively large glycan chains containing more than 5 monosaccharides and terminated with sialic acids, fucose, and sulphate moieties. The loss of the mucin core 1 and core 3 structure in mice and man results in reduced MUC 2 synthesis. This may be due to the loss of the core 1 and core3 synthases [467,468,469,470,471] or depletion of the \u03b21-3-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase.

            "text": "Increased levels of sialyl-Tn in colorectal cancer have been well documented [472,502]. They can arise due to a number of possible mechanisms. Firstly, if the glycosyltransferases that form and elongate the core1 and core 3 structures are absent, only the Tn and sialyl-Tn structures can be formed. Secondly, upregulation of the sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC1 leads to the formation of sialyl-Tn, which is a \u201cdead end\u201d glycan as there are no glycosyltransferases known which can act on this disaccharide. The increased ST6GALNAC1 competes against the core 1 and core 3 synthases to prevent the normal levels of mucin cores being formed [20,496,503,504]. The faults may arise due to mutations in the glycosyltransferases to generate inactive enzymes, alternatively subcellular targeting of the transferases to the wrong ER and Golgi compartments will prevent their action on the normal substrates to complete the expected extended mucin glycans. In addition, modification of the pH of the Golgi lumen may prevent optimal action of the glycosyltransferases [473]. As noted for IBD, this results in a depletion of the extended glycans normally found in colonic mucins and the appearance of incomplete, truncated glycans such as the Tn-antigen (GalNAc\u03b1-ser/thr) [502,505], and TF-antigen (core 1, Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc-) are hallmarks of these cancer related changes [506,507]. Other changes in cancer mucin sialylation include an increase in core 3 sialyl-Lex NeuAc\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc\u03b21-3(NeuAc\u03b12-6)GalNAc- [508,509] and loss of the loss of the Sda antigen GalNAc\u03b21,4(Neu5Ac\u03b12,3) Gal\u03b21,3/4GlcNAc\u03b21,3GalNAc- [188]. These changes are modulated by the specific sialyltransferases [510]. The formation of the Sda antigen under normal conditions competes with the biosynthesis of the sialyl-Lewis antigens, which only occur at low levels. Dramatic loss or down regulation of B4GALNT2 has been shown in colorectal cancer [23], leading to increased formation of the sialyl-Lewis antigens, which have been employed as biomarkers for colorectal cancer [188,511].",

This has been correlated with the loss of the O-acetyltransferase specific for the sialic acids (OAT) [191]. These O-acetyl esters protect the sialic acids that carry them against sialidase activity. This may be relevant in the colonic lumen, where the enteric microbiota expresses a number of sialidases [63,191,515,516]. The recent improved assessment of sialic acid O-acetylation using the nidovirus virolectins implicates O-acetylated sialic acids in cell development, homeostasis, and other functions [239]. As it has previously been impossible to screen for a differential pattern of O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins in the colon, the role of various sialoglycoproteins could not be assessed. The use of the nidovirus virolectins opens the way to test for the possible functional roles of O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins and the potential impact of their loss in colorectal cancer.",

Mass spectrometry (MS) has been a fundamental method for the mapping of glycosylation patterns and has been developed in a variety of modes [213,518]. Combination of MS with other techniques such as high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), have broadened the application of the study of glycans and glycoconjugates. The design of new bio-orthogonal labeling methods continues to improve the assessment of glycan expression in real time [519,520]. Other fields where rapid improvements are apparent are X-ray crystallography, electron imaging methods such as cryo-electron microscopy and force microscopic techniques\u2014atomic force microscopy (AFM) [273,274,275,276]. Current emphasis is on the simplification of techniques to allow high throughput approaches for broader analysis.",

Issues that are related to the topics discussed in this review are briefly listed below:The attachment of O-glycans to either serine or threonine residues in mucin tandem repeat domains has been identified as a regulated biological event. The significance of this biochemical configuration deserves wider exploration. Methods to carry out such screening are available.Why does fecal diversion trigger changes that are also seen in cancer?Nucleotide sugar metabolism is fundamental to normal glycosylation processes. However, the links with catabolic pathways and their integration with biosynthesis are still poorly understood and should be examined more closely at cell, tissue and organ levels.Different populations of O-acetylated sialic acids in colonic mucins are evident in the colorectal mucosa as detected by the PR3A5 and 6G4 antibodies. These patterns should be reexamined using the nidovirus probes reported recently in order to obtain more precise information regarding their biological functions. In addition, the identification and biological significance of non O-acetylators should be examined in order to understand the importance of sialic acid O-acetylation.The Sda antigen is implicated as a major sialoglycan present in colonic mucins, which is normally O-acetylated, but is lost in colorectal cancer and in fecal diversion. It is clear that bacteria talk to this mucin glycan. Does the Sda antigen represent a discrete group of O-acetylated sialic acids?Mucin sulphation is poorly studied. A combination of chemical and immunohistological studies is needed to address the expression patterns in normal health and the implications of specific deletions in disease.In IBD changes relating to the age of patients, their ethnicity, disease severity deserve further investigation. In addition, the composition of the microbiota during development should be examined for IBD patients.",
