            "text": "Community-Acquired Pneumonia-Back to Basics Marc J. M. Bonten and Jan Jelrik Oosterheert Background Lower respiratory tract infections are among the most common infectious diseases worldwide and are caused by the inflammation and consolidation of lung tissue due to an infectious agent. 1 The clinical criteria for the diagnosis include chest pain, cough, auscultatory findings such as rales or evidence of pulmonary consolidation, fever, or leukocytosis. Radiographic evidence, such as the presence of new infiltrates on chest radiograph, and laboratory evidence can support the diagnosis. 2 Elderly and patients with underlying conditions, such as cerebro-and cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcoholism, are at increased risk for developing lower respiratory tract infections and complicated courses of infection. 3, 4 Complications include the development of progressive pneumonia, pleural empyema, uncontrolled sepsis, and death, sometimes even despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment. 5 Because of differences in pathogenesis and causative microorganisms, healthcare-associated and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are usually distinguished. CAP represents a broad spectrum of disease severity, ranging from mild pneumonia that can be managed by general practitioners to severe pneumonia with septic shock needing treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most cases of CAP are successfully managed in primary care and approximately 20 and 1% of patients need hospitalization or treatment in ICU, respectively. 6, 7 Despite the widespread availability of antibiotics and reduced mortality since their introduction, lower respiratory tract infections remain the most important infectious cause of death in the developed world. 8 For instance, absolute mortality due to pneumonia has increased in the past 10 years in the Netherlands and the United States. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Estimated annual costs for treating CAP were in excess of 1 billion US$ in the United Kingdom in 1997 and 9.7 billion US$ in the United States in 2001. 8, [13] [14] [15] Lower respiratory tract infections are most frequently caused by bacteria or viruses. Treatment should be directed toward the causative organisms, with antibiotics prescribed only for bacterial infections and being withheld for nonbacterial causes of inflammation. Yet, causative agents have usually not been identified at the time that treatment must be initiated and empirical therapy should, therefore, cover the most likely pathogens. This implies that it is unavoidable that empirical therapy frequently includes a wider range of pathogens and, thus, a broader antibiotic spectrum than a choice that exclusively covers the pathogen involved.",

Despite this paradigm, overuse of antibiotics frequently occurs, especially in case of viral infections. 16 Yet, this goal to minimize unnecessary antibiotic use must be balanced constantly against the urge to cover all potential pathogens in order to prescribe optimal treatment for the individual patient. Therefore, optimizing therapeutic efficacy of empirical treatment, while preventing unnecessary antibiotic use have become important issues in the management of lower respiratory tract infections. In this chapter, etiologic, diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive considerations are described to optimize antibiotic prescription for the individual patient with lower respiratory tract infections, while keeping antibiotic resistance development on a population level in mind.",

Influenza pneumonia may be complicated by secondary bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or other Gram-negative pathogens. 21, 26 Recently, coronaviruses have been recognized as causes of severe lower respiratory tract infections. The SARS coronavirus caused severe CAP associated with high mortality rates, even in previously healthy adults. 27, 28 Non-SARS coronaviruses such as the coronavirus OC43 have been associated with lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults. 25, [29] [30] [31] Human metapneumovirus is increasingly recognized as a cause of respiratory failure in children and of pneumonia in the elderly. 32, 33 Importantly, up to 60% of episodes of CAP remain of unknown etiology. 6 ",

[34] [35] [36] [37] [38] New opportunities include the use of systemic levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Yet, although raised CRP and PCT levels have been claimed to be indicative for bacterial infections, CRP levels could not differentiate between bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections in adults, 39 nor could PCT in children admitted with CAP. 40, 41 From another perspective, though, PCT was used to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in patients with clinical symptoms of LRTI, without subsequent adverse effect on patient outcomes. Of note, reduction of antibiotic use was primarily achieved through withholding of antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute bronchitis and only 36% of patients had CAP in this study. 42 ",

However, the clinical value of these conventional diagnostic methods in guiding treatment of CAP is limited because of low sensitivity and considerable delay. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] Culturing other samples for which more invasive procedures are needed, such as pleural and bronchoalveolar fluids, might increase diagnostic yields, but inherently suffer from the same diagnostic delay. In one study, fiberoptic bronchoscopy provided an etiological diagnosis in 25% of patients in whom conventional diagnostic methods failed to identify a causative microorganism. 48 Yet, pathogen-directed empirical therapy in this study was not associated with better clinical outcome of patients. 49 Fiberoptic bronchoscopy should, therefore, be considered for cases of treatment failure without identified causative microorganism from conventional diagnostics. Importantly, even in study settings with extensive diagnostic testing, approximately 50% of episodes of CAP remain of unknown etiology [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [34] [35] [36] [37] The use of sputum Gram staining in the diagnostic workup of CAP is controversial: its use is recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), but not by the American Thoracic Society (ATS). 50, 51 Advantages of sputum Gram staining include its wide availability and low costs. However, adequate sputum samples cannot always be obtained, either because there is no sputum production or because samples are not adequate for evaluation. Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity are unknown, some bacteria cannot be identified, and a uniform definition of a positive stain does not exist. 45, 46 Urinary Antigen Testing Two urinary antigen tests are available for diagnosing the microbial cause of CAP. The NOW S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test (Binax, Inc., Portland, Maine) detects, within 15 minutes, the C polysaccharide wall antigen common to all S. pneumoniae strains. 52 One study reported 90-100% specificity and 74% sensitivity. 53 Yet, specificity might be reduced due to nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci. 54 The other urinary antigen test detects L. pneumophila type I and test accuracy increases with severity of disease, with sensitivities varying from approximately 40% in mild to 95% in severe CAP. 55 Immediate (within 24 hours after hospital admission) therapy for Legionnaires' disease, as detected by this test, increased ICU-free survival as compared to therapy initiated after \u03fe 24 hours. 56 ",

For the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, \u2424-lactam antibiotic concentrations should exceed the MIC for at least 40% of the time. 59 When strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin are anticipated, this can be achieved with higher dosages of penicillin (e.g., 2 million units q 6 hours) or amoxicillin (e.g., 1 gram q 6 hours). In clinical studies, mortality rates of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and treated with \u2424-lactam antibiotics were comparable for episodes caused by pneumococci susceptible and nonsusceptible to penicillin. 60 Macrolide resistance is either due to modification of the target site, encoded by the ermB gene, or an active efflux pump that removes macrolides from the cell, encoded by the mef gene. In S. pneumoniae, the erm gene is associated with high levels of resistance to all macrolides. Erythromycin resistance based on efflux mechanisms can be overcome by the use of newer macrolides, such as azithromycin. 60 The newer fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, are active, in vitro, against most relevant significant aerobic Gram-positive cocci, the Enterobacteriaceae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Legionella species, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae, which make them attractive compounds for treatment of CAP. Development of resistance to fluoroquinolones, which can occur even during treatment, however, is a matter of serious concern. 61, 62 Resistance to fluoroquinolones results from mutations in the target enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV), thereby reducing the inhibitory effects of fluoroquinolones on bacterial DNA synthesis. Strains usually become fully resistant when both target genes are mutated. Other resistance mechanisms include alterations in the bacterial cell membrane and active efflux of the drug. 61, 62 Importantly, prevalence of antibiotic resistance varies geographically. For instance, prevalence of reduced susceptibility to penicillin among S. pneumoniae is around 40% in Spain and \u03fd 1% in the Netherlands (http://www.earss.rivm.nl). Furthermore, over 50% of macrolide resistance in Europe is caused by mutations in the ermB gene, 63 whereas presence of an efflux pump is the predominant resistance mechanism of S. pneumoniae to macrolides in the United States. 60 Therefore, decisions on empirical antimicrobial treatment should be based on local antibiotic resistance rates.",

            "text": "When organisms are known, recommended treatment should be aimed at the isolated pathogen (Table 11 .1). However, the initial treatment of CAP, as recommended in recent guidelines, is predominantly based on the clinical severity of presentation rather than the presumed causative pathogen (Table 11 .2). For the prediction of clinical severity, several risk classifications exist which include combinations of underlying illnesses, age, and clinical features. In clinical practice, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be prescribed more liberally in patients with \"severe\" CAP (SCAP). Therefore, a reliable prognostic model might be useful in tailoring empirical therapy in individual patients. Pragmatically, SCAP could be defined by the need of ICU admission. However, this definition does not include objective measurements and depends on local policies for ICU admission that may vary considerably between centers. 66 The ATS proposed to define SCAP on the presence of a certain set of minor and major clinical signs or symptoms. 50 The British Thoracic Society defined SCAP using a more or less similar set of \"core,\" \"additional,\" and \"preexisting\" adverse prognostic features. 67 Another algorithm to predict mortality risk and thus severity of CAP is the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), which classifies patients in five groups. In the development of this scoring system, 30-day mortality rates gradually increased per class from 0.1% in class I, to 31.1% in class V.The ATS criteria had a high sensitivity but low specificity for predicting ICU admission 68 and in another study only 17% of patients in risk class V of the PSI system had been admitted to ICU. 69 To what extent these criteria and algorithms can be used for choosing empirical therapy remains to be determined. 50, 67, 69, 70 In our view, clinical judgment, which is difficult to describe in objective terms, remains important in the management of patients with CAP.",

            "text": "The recommended length of antimicrobial treatment of CAP is usually based on the causative pathogen, response to treatment, presence of comorbid illness, and complications. Current guidelines recommend to treat CAP caused by S. pneumoniae until the patient has been afebrile for 72 hours, whereas episodes caused by bacteria associated with pulmonary necrosis (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella, and anaerobes) should be treated for about 2 weeks. 51 A duration of 2 weeks is also recommended for CAP caused by M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and legionnaires' disease in immunocompetent individuals. Treatment length could be reduced by using azithromycin, due to its long halflife in tissues, although longer courses are probably needed for Legionella infections. 51, 86 These recommendations on treatment duration are not based on results of controlled trials. Recently, treatment durations of 3 and 8 days with amoxicillin \u03ee clavulanic acid were compared in a randomized double-blind trial of 186 adult patients with mild CAP. At day 10, outcomes for clinical success, pathogen eradication, radiological response, and duration of hospitalization were similar for both groups, whereas adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving 8 days of amoxicillin. 87 In conventional treatment approaches, intravenous therapy is continued until definite clinical cure has been achieved. Based on nonrandomized studies in patients with mild to moderately severe CAP, patients hospitalized with CAP can be managed safely and more efficiently by an early switch from IV to oral medication. [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] For patients with severe CAP, an early switch to oral antibiotic treatment also seems to reduce length of hospital stay (by approximately 2 days) and treatment associated costs, without adverse effects on treatment outcome. 94 Prevention Prevention of CAP, for instance through vaccination, may well reduce antibiotic use and thus resistance development. With regard to respiratory infections, vaccines are available against pneumococci and influenza. Currently, a 23valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), covering the 23 most prevalent serotypes of S. pneumoniae, is recommended in most Western countries for persons at high risk for developing CAP. However, the available data to support these recommendations are far from consistent. Nonexperimental retrospective studies suggest that PPV is effective and cost-saving in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. 95, 96 However, confounding by indication might have played a considerable role in these studies affecting the validity of the results. Several clinical studies and systematic reviews yielded conflicting results with regard to the prevention of bacteremic pneumonia even in highrisk patients who were previously hospitalized with CAP. [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] Therefore, the real value of pneumococcal vaccination strategies, in terms of effects on nonbacteremic pneumonia and costs, needs further exploration, preferably in randomized controlled trials. 103, 104 Influenza vaccination is recommended for patients who have a high risk for influenza complications, like severe viral pneumonia or severe secondary bacterial infection. Patients at high risk for these complications can be identified based on host characteristics such as age, gender, comorbidity, and external factors, such as long-term immunosuppressive drug use or residence in closed communities with high transmission rates. 105 In meta-analysis vaccine effectiveness was 50% for preventing hospitalization and 68% for preventing death in high-risk patients. In addition to elderly patients, younger persons with highrisk medical conditions might also benefit from annual influenza vaccination. 101, 106, 107 Data on clinical effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing postinfluenza complications among high-risk persons of working age are limited and indicate no or at most limited benefits from vaccination. 102, 105, 108 Quantitative effects on antibiotic use of influenza vaccination are unknown, but it is tempting to argue that an effective influenza vaccination program might reduce antibiotic use.",
