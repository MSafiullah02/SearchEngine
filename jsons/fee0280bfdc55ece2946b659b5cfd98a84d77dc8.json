Already, reports are emerging of a parallel epidemic of fear, anxiety and depression 6 . But at present, it remains unclear what is triggering these adverse psychological effects: worries over potential adversities due to the virus, or the toll of actually experiencing adverse events. Literature suggests that experiencing adversities such as ill-health, financial problems, and challenges meeting basic needs is associated with poor psychological outcomes including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and broader distress 7, 8 . This has been found to apply to situations in epidemics too 9 . However, it is not just experiencing adversities that can have such effects; even worries about experiencing adverse effects can negatively impact on mental health. For example, experiencing daily worries is associated with depressive symptoms both in the short-term and over several years 10, 11 . This has been shown for a range of worries, including those relating to health and finances 12, 13 . In fact, worries and other negative reactions to an event have in some instances been found to be more important in predicting mental health and wellbeing than experiencing the event itself 14 . It is vital to ascertain whether it is worries of adversity or experiences of adversity that are most strongly linked to declines in mental health as each require different types of support or interventions to prevent or mitigate their effects. For example, if worries are most strongly associated with poor mental health, then provision of greater public reassurance or individual interventions such as online cognitive behavioural therapy programmes could be made more available to people. In contrast, if experience of adversity shows greater associations with poor mental health, then interventions that provide more tangible and material support (such as further financial relief measures) may be key.",

The study is not random but does contain a well-stratified sample. Participants were recruited using three primary approaches. First, snowballing was used, including promoting the study through existing networks and mailing lists (including large databases of adults who had previously consented to be involved in health research across the UK), print and digital media coverage, and social media. Second, more targeted recruitment was undertaken focusing on (i) individuals from a low-income background, (ii) individuals with no or few educational qualifications, and (iii) individuals who were unemployed. Third, the study was promoted via partnerships with third sector organisations to vulnerable groups, including adults with pre-existing mental health conditions, older adults, carers, and people experiencing domestic violence or abuse.

From these variables, we constructed a Low SEP index measure by counting indications of low SEP (income <\u00a316k, educational qualifications of GCSE or lower, unemployed, living in rented or rent free accommodation, and living in over-crowded accommodation), collapsing into 0, 1, and 2+ indications of low SEP to attain adequate sample sizes for each category.",

This approach is advantageous as individual stable characteristics such as socio-economic status, genetics, personality, history of mental illness and threshold for worries could confound associations between adversities and mental health. But as individuals are compared with themselves, such bias cannot affect results. Additionally, having experiences and worries varies over time, as does mental health, and both can be affected by time-varying confounders. Fixed-effects regression allows us to analyse these time-varying associations. So in this analysis we were able to assess the relationship between changes in both experiences and worries about adversity across several four weeks of data collection, with changes in mental health.",

For example, when considering those relating to finance, adverse consequences for mental health may take time to arise, for instance as individuals encounter rejections during job searches or cuts in income begin to impact living standards 28 . Indeed, a recent study found that unemployment becomes more highly related to feelings of sadness after 3 months of unemployment 29 , suggesting a delayed response time for events. In line with this, it is notable that we found higher associations for the relationship between inability to pay bills and mental health than loss of income and mental health, suggesting the implications of losing money may be more important than losing money itself. Indeed, while loss of income could occur across the wealth spectrum, inability to pay bills is likely concentrated at those with lower levels of household income, so could be regarded as a more significant experience. Financial adversities may also have been anticipated, which may have decreased mental health in the lead up to the event, leading to a floor effect by the time the event occurred 29 . Drops in household income may also have been offset by reductions in expenditure due to lockdown. But it is also possible that the fear of potential adversity, in particular given the low levels of control experienced in worrying, is psychologically more demanding than the adjustment after an adverse event has occurred 30 . The exception to this theory on psychological demand is experiences of adversities relating to personal safety. These were much more strongly linked with mental health than worries about personal safety, and had the strongest link with mental health out of all adversities assessed, which echoes research on the strong negative mental health impact of domestic abuse and violence 31 .",

But it is also possible that in terms of anxiety, the experience of the virus was less bad than some people had been fearing, leading to relief that individuals had not experienced serious health consequences. Nevertheless, although the confidence intervals were wide, there was still evidence to suggest that catching COVID-19 was associated with increases in depression.

This echoes previous research suggesting that higher SEP can be a buffer against the effects of adversity, with individuals of lower SEP more vulnerable especially to economic shocks 17 . But it is also of note that there was some evidence of a reverse social gradient for adversity worries (especially for more significant worries), with individuals of higher SEP more affected. This could suggest that people who usually face fewer adversities in day to day life, the experience of new worries relating to adversity may have more profound effects 33 . Or it could reflect the already higher levels of anxiety and depression found amongst individuals of lower SEP, suggesting a ceiling effect in reactivity to stressful situations 3, 15 .",

As such, our measurement of worries was relative to each individual's own perspectives, circumstances and coping threshold, allowing us to assess changes in an individual's perception of their worries over time. Although, it should be noted that there were much wider confidence intervals measurements of association between experiences and mental health compared to worries and mental health, suggesting that people's responses to experiences are much more variable, presumably due to differences in coping styles and wider circumstances. However, the study had several limitations. Our sampling was not random, so although we deliberately sampled from groups such as individuals of low SEP and individuals with existing mental illness, it is possible that more extreme experiences were not adequately captured in the study. It is also possible that individuals experiencing particularly extreme situations during the lockdown withdrew from the study. While our statistical method means their data is still included, we would lack longitudinal follow-up on their changing experiences. We also focused on just six types of adversities, including those relating to health, safety, finances and basic needs. However, many other types of adversity were not included in the study, including those relating to interpersonal relationships, displacement, and bereavement. Finally, our study only followed individuals up for a few weeks looking at the immediate associations with mental health. As such, it remains for future studies to assess how experience of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic relates to long-term mental health consequences.",

            "text": "Overall, the finding that mental health was associated both with experiences and worries about adversities suggests that interventions are required that both seek to prevent adverse events (such as loss of jobs) but also that reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies. This appears to be particularly important for managing anxiety, where provision of online cognitive-behavioural training may help support individuals in the management of uncertainty. These results suggest that measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK have been insufficient at reassuring people given we are still seeing clear associations with poor mental health both for cumulative worries and also for a range of specific worries relating to finance, access to essentials, personal safety and COVID-19. Given the challenges in providing mental health support to individuals during the lockdown, these findings highlight the importance of developing online and remote interventions that could provide such support, both as COVID-19 continues and in preparation for future pandemics.",
