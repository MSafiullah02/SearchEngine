We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like /pol/, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also, using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of new Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.",

Also, by comparing our findings to real-world events, we find that the increase in these discussions and Sinophobic slurs coincides with real-world events related to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. Using word embeddings, we looked into the context of words used in discussions referencing Chinese people finding that various racial slurs are used in these contexts on both Twitter and /pol/. This indicates that Sinophobic behavior is a cross-platform phenomenon existing in both fringe Web communities like /pol/ and mainstream ones like Twitter. 3. Using word embeddings over time, we discover new emerging slurs and terms related to Sinophobic behavior, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, on /pol/ we observe the emergence of the term \"kungflu\" after January, 2020, while on Twitter we observe the emergence of the term \"asshoe,\" which aims to make fun of the accent of Chinese people speaking English. 4. By comparing our dataset pre-and post-COVID-19 outbreak, we observe shifts in the content posted by users on Twitter and /pol/. On Twitter, we observe a shift towards blaming China and Chinese people about the outbreak, while on /pol/ we observe a shift towards using more, and new, Sinophobic slurs.",

Keum and Miller [29] argued that racism on the Internet is pervasive and that users are likely to encounter it. Zimmerman et al. [56] focused on the influence that the anonymity brought by the Internet has on the likelihood for people to take part in online aggression. Relia et al. [39] found that racist online activity correlates with hate crimes. In other words, users located in areas with higher occurrence of hate crimes are more likely to engage in racism on social media. Yang and Counts [53] studied how users who experienced racism on Reddit self-narrate their experience. They characterize the different types of racism experienced by users with different demographics, and show that commiseration is the most valued form of social support.",

This rate increases dramatically around March 9, 2020 (annotation 5), which is when the Italian government extended the lock-down to the entirety of Italy.

There is one important difference however. The amount of relative discussion on Twitter during the first peak is much lower than the level of discussion once Europe comes into play. This may be due to the fact that discussion on Twitter is more geographically distributed, or that 4chan's /pol/ is more easily inflamed by conspiracies and racism-related posts. Social distance may work as one factor in illustrating the gap between two peaks. Referring to the perception of others [48, 6, 1, 14] , this perception can be elevated by a familiarity of cultural, nationality, ethics, education, occupation, etc. Geographically intimacy, as well as close cultural background, leads to higher attention on COVID-19 outbreak in Europe than the lock-down in Wuhan.",

The upswing is potentially related to the scapegoating phenomenon [47] The first cases originated in China, and the Chinese government was the first to take active and serious measures to combat its spread prompting a reasonable degree of discussion. When these measures were ineffective in preventing the spread to the Western world, however, China's existing association with COVID-19, in particular China's \"failure\" to prevent its spread make it a just scapegoat [2] in the face of a looming pandemic.",

The clearly racist reaction fits the notion of defensive denial, which is a common strategy for coping with stress [3, 17, 24, 27, 42] . Essentially, the early stages of COVID-19 were exclusively a Chinese problem; \"superior\" Western society had nothing to worry about, even though experts were warning of a pandemic breakout even before Wuhan was locked down. This conforms with the scapegoating theory of clinical psychology, in which members of a group project unwanted self aspects onto another person or group, then attack the scapegoat believing that \"this is not me\" [13, 18, 38] . Political scientists have argued that scapegoating is a major driver for racism in a number of settings [15, 37] .",

In this model, words used in similar context will present similar vectors. The left side of Table 2 reports the top 20 most similar words for the terms \"china,\" \"chinese,\" and \"virus.\" We make several observations: first, we note that there are many derogatory terms for Asian people, Chinese people in particular, in the top 20 most similar terms. Some examples include \"chink\" (derogatory term referring to Asian people), \"chinkland\" (referring to the land of chinks, i.e., China), and \"chiniggers\" (an offensive word created by combining \"china\" and \"nigger\"). For instance, a /pol/ user posted: \"We should have never let these Chiniggers into the country or enforced a mandatory quarantine for anyone coming from contaminated areas. But it's too late now.\" Another /pol/ user posted: \"You chinks deserve it, there's no shithole of a country that could be as disgusting as chinkland.\" This indicates that /pol/ users use a wide variety of derogatory terms to possibly disseminate hateful ideology towards Chinese and Asian people. Second, by looking at the most similar words of the term \"virus,\" we find several terms related to the COVID-19 pandemic [50] . This is evident since the four most similar words to the term \"virus\" are related to COVID-19, specifically, \"coronovirus,\" \"covid,\" \"coronavirus,\" and \"corona.\" This indicates that the overall use of words in /pol/ is highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and this event is likely to cause changes in the use of language by users.",

[55] . In a nutshell, we create a graph where nodes are words and an edge between the words exists if their cosine similarity (obtained from the trained word2vec model) is above a pre-defined threshold. 5 We limit the graph into nodes that are two hops away from a specific word of interest (in this case \"chinese\"). Then, we perform various tasks for visualizing the graph. First, the graph is layed out in the graph space with an algorithm that takes into account the weights of the edges [26] . That is, words that have large cosine similarities are layed out closer in the graph space. Second, the size of each node is relative to the number of occurrences of the word in our dataset. Third, we run the the Louvain community detection method [5] on the graph and represent nodes that belong to the same community with the same color. The resulting graphs are depicted in Figure 6 and 7 for /pol/ and Twitter, respectively. By inspecting the obtained communities of words in Figure 6 , we observe several interesting themes around the use of words related to \"chinese.\" First, we observe a community that is highly related to the COVID-19 pandemic (blue community on bottom right). Interestingly, within this community, we also observe terms like \"biowepon\" (sic) and \"bioattack,\" likely indicating that /pol/ users are sharing probably false information about the pandemic, for instance claiming that the whole pandemic is a \"bioattack\" from the Chinese on the Western world. For example, a /pol/ user posted: \"Anyone that doesn't realize this is a Chinese bioweapon by now is either a brainlet or a chicom noodle nigger.\" Second, we observe two tightlyknit communities (red and yellow communities on left-side of the graph) that appear to predominantly include derogatory terms towards Asian, and in particular Chinese people. Some of the words in these communities are \"ricenigger,\" \"chinksect,\" \"chankoro,\" \"chinks,\" \"yellowniggers,\" and \"pindick.\" By looking at some examples of posts from /pol/ users, we observe the use of these terms for disseminating hate: e.g., \"Chang you useless ricenigger fuck off. Just call the bitch and ask her youll see this is fucking ccp bs. ITS A FUCKING EX-PERIMENTAL CHINK BIOWEP\" and \"I fucking hate chinks. Stop spreading viruses everywhere you pindick cunts.\" Interestingly, the most distant word in these communities is the word \"batsoup,\" which is closer to the community related to COVID-19 [44] . The rest of the communities in this graph are seemingly related to China in general (purple community) and to other countries in Asia (green community). Overall, this graph highlights that /pol/ users use a wide variety of derogatory terms to characterize Chinese people.",

The frequent appearance of swear words among the terms can indicate an abreaction to the rising fear and stress in front of the disease [21, 16] . At the same time, the racist and targeted focus of these slurs can be explained with the mechanism of defensive aggression, either focusing on cultural taboos, such as sexuality [16, 25] , or perpetuating societal oppression [25] .",

First, when looking at the most similar words to the term \"china\" from the first week model (left side of Table 3 ), we observe words referring to other counties, mostly in Asia (e.g., \"japan,\" \"singapore,\" etc.), but also that the derogatory term \"chinks\" is among the top 20. This result indicates that 4chan's /pol/ users typically use racial slurs targeted to Chinese people, and this was also happening even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar findings can be observed by looking at the most similar words to the term \"chinese.\" We observe the existence of racial slurs like \"chink,\" however, most of the other words relate to people originating from other Asian countries, such as \"koreans.\" When looking at the most similar words to the term \"virus,\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, we observe general terms related to diseases or other outbreaks, e.g., \"ebola.\" Second, by comparing the most similar words from the first and last models, we observe several interesting differences. By looking at the most similar words to the term \"china,\" we observe that derogatory terms like \"chink\" have a higher cosine similarity compared to the first model, likely indicating a rise in the use of this term in discussions related to China. Furthermore, we observe terms like \"chernobyl,\" which may indicate that /pol/ users are comparing this outbreak with the Chernobyl disaster. For example, a /pol/ user posted: \"I can see China collapsing after all this, just as the Chernobyl incident was the beginning of the end for the USSR....\" We also see the term \"childkiller,\" which upon manual investigation is due to a particularly active user repeatedly posting that China created COVID-19 as a bioweapon. Specifically, we find multiple occurrences of the following sentence in multiple /pol/ posts: \"CHINA CRE-ATED THE CHINA BIOWEAPON MURDER DEATH CHILD-KILLER VIRUS IN CHINA!\" Interestingly, we also find some terms that seem to be sarcastic towards the way that Chinese people talk English. For instance, the term \"numba\" refers to Table 3 : Top 20 most similar words to the words \"china,\" \"chinese,\" and \"virus\" for the first and last trained word2vec models from 4chan's /pol/.",

For example, a /pol/ user posted: \"THIS IS BIOTERRORISM NUKE CHINA NOW.\" By looking at the most similar words to the term \"virus,\" we find that the most similar one is the term \"bioengineered,\" indicating that the conspiracy theory went viral on /pol/ during that specific week and was discussed extensively. For instance a /pol/ user posted: \"The bat soup is just a cover-up. One of (((Leiber)))'s chinks stole the bioengineered virus & tried to patent it in China, violating export-controlled laws & committing espionage. My guess is, he didn't handle the virus correctly, got himself sick, then infected others in the Wuhan wet market.\" Finally, by looking at the other similar words to the term \"virus,\" we clearly observe those that are related to the COVID-19 pandemic with terms like \"wuflu\" (created by combining Wuhan and Flu), \"covid,\" and \"corona.\" For instance, a /pol/ user posted \"Die to wuflu already, boomers.\"",

Specifically, we initially extract the vocabulary from the model trained on historical data (W C ) and treat it as our base vocabulary. Then, for each weekly trained model (W t=i , i \u2208 T ), we extract the vocabulary and compare the terms with our base vocabulary: for each term that is new, we add it to our base vocabulary treat it as a new term. Since, we want to find new terms that are related to Chinese, we filter out all new terms that have a cosine similarity below 0.5 in the weekly trained model for which we discovered the new term. Overall, using the above methodology, we manage to discover a total of 50 new terms. Then, we visualize the popularity of the 20 most popular new terms of the course of our dataset in Figure 9 .",
