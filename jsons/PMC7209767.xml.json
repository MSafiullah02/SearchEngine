            "text": "Solar steam generation (SSG) has a great application prospect in producing clean drinkable water from polluted water at zero CO2 emission, since it uses the renewable and abundant solar energy as the only energy source [1, 2]. In typical SSG systems, solar energy is harvested and converted to thermal energy by photothermal materials and the thermal energy is used to heat up liquid water to generate steam [3]. Many efforts have been devoted to developing advanced photothermal materials, which have made the old concept of SSG become a rejuvenated green technology [4]. Carbonaceous materials are inherently suitable for broad light absorption owing to the \u03c0-band\u2019s optical transitions. Their optically excited electrons can quickly relax via thermalization due to electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering [5]. Various carbonaceous materials, such as graphene, graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotube (CNT), graphite, carbon black, etc. have been investigated as the photothermal materials [6]. Although CNT and graphene are two representative kinds of carbonaceous materials for SSG, both of them are still more expensive than gold. Moreover, the fabrication of graphene or CNT-based photothermal materials is complicated, making them unrealistic for widespread use [7, 8]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop inexpensive, easy-to-manufacture, mechanically robust carbonaceous materials for SSG [9].",

The more people choose to shop online, the more delivery packages are need. In China, the number of corrugated cardboard box used for express packages increased from 9.92 billion in 2015 to 14.4 billion in 2016. Waste corrugated cardboard boxes (WCCB) have became one of the main constituents of municipal solid waste (MSW) in China, but less than 20% of them are collected and reused [21, 22]. Therefore, it is of great environmental and economic significance to develop a facile and feasible way for the recycling of WCCB. Since WCCB consists mainly of cellulose fibers [23, 24], it is an interesting subject to utilize WCCB as a carbonaceous precursor for porous carbon materials, which can simultaneously be used for SSG and adsorption.",

The weight loss rate of H2O-WCCB became slow above 400 \u00b0C because the thermal decomposition of cellulose finished at this temperature. Instead, the carbonization of carbonaceous matters in the residue became the primary reaction, leading to the release of small molecules at a slow rate. The minor weight loss peak at 740 \u00b0C was caused by the decomposition of CaCO3 in the residue, which is one of the commonly used mineral fillers during paper-making [23, 27].",

The DTG peak belonged to CaCO3 disappeared due to the demineralization caused by H3O+ generated from the hydrolysis of FeCl3 during slurrying [28]. It is worth noting that the solid residue rate of Fe-WCCB was as higher as 12.19% than that of WCCB at 1000 \u00b0C, indicating that Fe(III) loaded on WCCB greatly benefited the formation of char.",

For the main pyrolysis stages of H2O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB, D1 and F2 models had the highest R2 values reached 0.9915 and 0.9943, respectively, and the change of reaction model suggested the change of pyrolysis reaction pathway. Moreover, the activation energies of the pyrolysis reactions of H2O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB were calculated to be 129.59 and 52.96 kJ mol\u22121, respectively. As known, cellulose was composed of numerous glucose units connected by glycosidic bonds, and the pyrolysis of cellulose is initiated from the cleavage of these glycosidic bonds [29].The break of glycosidic bonds can be facilitated through the attack of H3O+ generated from hydrolysis of FeCl3 [28]. Moreover, as a typical Lewis acidic ion, Fe3+ possibly interacted with the glucose units during slurrying, forming relatively stable complexes and changing electronic cloud distribution; thus, the break of glycosidic bonds can be promoted [30, 31]. As a result, much less energy was needed for the thermal cracking of the cellulose in Fe-WCCB.",

As shown in Fig. 5c, Gram-Schmidt curves H2O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB had peaks at 368 and 322 \u00b0C, respectively, indicating the release of large amounts of gaseous products. When the temperature is fixed, absorbance information at different wavenumbers can be obtained to study the components released at this particular moment. Figure 5 d shows the FTIR spectra at the Gram-Schmidt peak temperatures for H2O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB. The gaseous products composed of a variety of molecules were evolved due to the pyrolysis of cellulose. By comparing the spectra of H2O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB, it was found that the types of the released products were not changed due to the presence of FeCl3, but the relative contents of these components were changed. The peaks centered at 3575 and 1506 cm\u22121 represented \u2013OH bond stretching vibrations in H2O. The peak at 2819 cm\u22121 indicated the stretching vibration of C\u2013H in acetaldehyde. The strongest peak at 2362 cm\u22121 was caused by the release of CO2. The release of CO led to the presence of two subtle peaks at 2184 and 2113 cm\u22121. The strong peak at 1748 cm\u22121 belonged to C=O stretching in furfurals. The peak at 1377 cm\u22121 can be ascribed to the bending vibration of phenolic \u2013OH groups. The peaks at 1170 and 1106 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of C\u2013O\u2013C in levoglucosan (LG) and \u2013OH in hydroxyacetone (HA), respectively [32]. The subtle peak at 863 cm\u22121 suggested the presence of hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA) [33].",

More importantly, the yields of the volatiles significantly reduced due to the presence of Fe3+, resulting in a higher char yield of Fe-WCCB. It was assumed that Fe(III) species played an important role in the inhibition of the generation of the volatile organics. The organics gaseous products were mainly released from Fe-WCCB between 200 and 360 \u00b0C, and FeCl3 decomposed into amorphous Fe(III) species (e.g., FeOOH) within this temperature range [34, 35].8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\mathrm{FeCl}}_3+2{\\mathrm{H}}_2\\mathrm{O}\\to \\mathrm{FeOCl}\\cdotp {\\mathrm{H}}_2\\mathrm{O}+2\\mathrm{HCl}\\to \\mathrm{FeOOH}+3\\mathrm{HCl} $$\\end{document}FeCl3+2H2O\u2192FeOCl\u00b7H2O+2HCl\u2192FeOOH+3HCl",

            "text": "Many researchers suggested that the thermal conversion of cellulose follows free-radical mechanism [36\u201338]. It proposes that heat causes the vibration and cleavage of covalent bonds in cellulose, forming free radicals and radical terminals on the surface of the solid, and the reactions are not terminated till two radicals collide with each other to form stable compound [39, 40]. The stable gaseous products are mainly generated from the reactions between the hydrogen radical and other radicals in the gas phase, while the radical reactions occurred inside and on the surface of cellulose network result in the formation of char [41, 42]. It has been extensively reported that FeOOH or Fe2O3 can be used as a flame retardant and a smoke suppression agent, because Fe(III) has the ability to capture radicals generated via the thermal decomposition of polymers [43\u201347]. As illustrated in Fig. 7, instead of directly converting into stable gaseous products, the free radicals generated from the thermal cracking of WCCB were firstly trapped by the Fe(III) species deposited on the surface of the solid particles, enhancing the chances of these free radicals participating in char formation process via condensation and polymerization reactions. Thus, less gaseous products were released from Fe-WCCB and the char yield increased.",

No Fe-related crystal structures (such as FeOOH, Fe2O3, Fe3O4) can be observed from XRD pattern of PCMFe/300, suggesting that Fe species in PCMFe/300 were in amorphous forms of short-range crystalline orders. The peak at 26.6 o indicated the presence of quartz (SiO2), which was used as a filler in WCCB [23]. For PCMFe/400, the peaks at 30.1\u00b0, 35.4\u00b0, 43.1\u00b0, 53.9\u00b0, 56.9\u00b0, and 62.8\u00b0 corresponding to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes, respectively, confirmed the presence of magnetite (Fe3O4). With the carbonization temperature increasing to 500, 600, and 700 \u00b0C, the intensity of Fe3O4 peaks continued to increase, indicating that higher carbonization temperature promoted the transformation of amorphous Fe species into crystalline Fe3O4. When the carbonization temperature achieved 800 \u00b0C, Fe3O4 peaks dramatically weakened and a sharp peak emerged at 44.8\u00b0, which belonged to (110) plane of \u03b1-Fe and proved the formation of zero-valent iron (Fe0) due to the carbothermal reduction of Fe3O4. Unlike PCMFe/800, XRD pattern of PCM800 only had two peaks at 26.7\u00b0 and 29.4\u00b0 attributed to quartz (SiO2) and calcite (CaCO3), respectively.",

The adsorption isotherms of all the samples except PCMFe/400 showed steep N2 uptakes at P/P0 \u2264 0.01, suggesting the initial filling of micropores (pore diameter \u2264 2 nm). The adsorbed volumes increased gradually at P/P0 \u2265 0.01 with no plateau at high relative pressures, indicating the presence of mesopores (2 nm < pore diameter < 50 nm). Based on the N2-adsorption data, the calculated value of BET surface area (SBET) of PCMFe/400 was only 35 m2 g\u22121, suggesting the incomplete removal of volatile matters at 400 \u00b0C. Pore characteristic parameters of the other samples calculated according to the N2-adsorption/desorption data are shown in Table 3. SBET increased to 264 m2 g\u22121 when the carbonization temperature reached up to 500 \u00b0C, because the releasing of volatiles at high temperature greatly favored the formation of pores. With the carbonization temperature increasing to 600 \u00b0C, higher micropore volume (Vmicro) and SBET were achieved due to the further removal of volatiles and consumption of amorphous carbon via the reduction of Fe(III) species to Fe3O4. The mesopore volume (Vmeso) decreased because the sintering effect at high temperature resulting in the narrowing of pores and the shrinkage of carbon structure. The development of pore volume was affected slightly by the increase of carbonization temperature from 600 to 700 \u00b0C, because the releasing of volatiles finished within this temperature range, and only the consumption of amorphous carbon contributed to the development of porosity. SBET increased remarkably from 358 to 404 m2 g\u22121 because a lot of Fe3O4 formed below 800 \u00b0C was reduced to \u03b1-Fe, leading to the etching of char and formation of micropores. Compared with PCMFe/800, PCM800 had much lower SBET and Vmicro, but a higher Vmeso. These differences demonstrated that the charring process of WCCB was significantly affected by FeCl3, which was favorable to the formation of a more developed microporous structure. DFT pore size distribution of PCMFe/500, PCMFe/600, PCMFe/700, PCMFe/800, and PCM800 within different pore diameter ranges is shown in Fig. 10. PCMFe/500, PCMFe/600, PCMFe/700, and PCMFe/800 showed sharp peaks between 0.5 and 0.6 nm, indicating the presence of large amounts of micropores. Besides, more micropores with smaller diameters were formed with the carbonization temperature increasing from 500 to 800 \u00b0C. PCMFe/500, PCMFe/600, PCMFe/700, and PCMFe/800 also had mesopores with diameters between 2.25 and 4.30 nm. The distribution became weaker when the carbonization temperature increased from 500 to 600 \u00b0C due to sintering effect, while the consumption of amorphous carbon contributed to the generation of some new mesopores within the same diameter range. By comparing the DFT curves of PCMFe/800 and PCM800, it was found that the introduction of FeCl3 was obviously beneficial to the formation of micropores. However, the mesoporous structure became less developed due to the blockage of mesopores caused by the FeCl3-derived products.",

            "text": "As mentioned, carbon materials can be used as solar absorbers due to optical transitions in the D band. Thus, Raman spectrometry analysis was necessary [51]. Raman spectra of PCMFe/500, PCMFe/600, PCMFe/700, and PCMFe/800 are shown in Fig. 11a. The spectra of all the samples exhibited D band and G band centered at 1334 and 1580 cm\u22121, respectively. D band is related to lattice defect and used to represent the disorder degree of graphite carbon, while G band is related to the vibration of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice [52]. The ratio of the relative intensity of D band and G band (ID/IG) is proportional to the crystalline degree of carbon materials [53]. The ID/IG values of the samples increased from 0.74 to 0.97 with the carbonization temperature increasing from 500 to 800 \u00b0C, suggesting the presence of more defect sites. For a quantitative characterization of the samples, the UV-Vis-NIR spectra were measured in the broadband solar spectrum. As shown in Fig. 11b), PCMFe/600 exhibited high light absorption above 80% within a broadband wavelength from 256 to 2140 nm, demonstrating its highest solar light absorption ability among these samples. Although the lowest ID/IG value of PCMFe/500 suggested that this sample contained the most sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and \u03c0 electrons accounting for light absorption, PCMFe/600 and PCMFe/700 had higher light adsorption abilities than PCMFe/500. This was because the light adsorption ability of a porous carbon material was not only closely related with its \u03c0 electrons, but also its pores. As shown in the inset, the incident light trapped in the pores of the carbon monolith can bounce back and forth between the walls, resulting in the light propagation and multiple light matter interactions and effective light harvest [4, 8, 54]. Thus, a higher BET surface area was no doubt conducive to improving the light adsorption.",

The increase of temperature became slowly after 150 s, and finally attained a high equilibrium value (61.9 \u00b0C) within 1830 s.

As shown in Fig. 14, PCMFe/600 was pressed under a beaker filled with water weighing 1267.75 g, and the monolith character of PCMFe/600 can be perfectly retained. This proved that PCMFe/600 was able to withstand the pressure at least 4875 times of its own weight (2.55 N), thus we can say that PCMFe/600 had a good mechanical rigidity. Moreover, PCMFe/600 can float well just above the water surface with the help of EPE foam. A hot region is expected to appear on the top of PCMFe/600 under solar irradiation via photothermal conversion. Benefitting from the porous framework providing water transport channels, water can be continuously pumped to the hot upper surface of PCMFe/600. In this configuration, the solar energy is localized at the water-air interface to heat thin layer where evaporation occurs, instead of wastefully heating the entire body of water, which conforms to the definition of interfacial SSG (ISSG) [3, 56].",

Figure 15 b shows the variation of temperature of the floating PCMFe/600 surface, neighboring water of PCMFe/600 and pure water with irradiation time. The temperature of PCMFe/600 surface rapidly increased from 22.7 to 31.7 \u00b0C within 300 s, and slowly increased to 36.5 \u00b0C over the remaining time. Meanwhile, the surface temperature of the neighboring water of PCMFe/600 reached 32.9 \u00b0C within 3600 s, while that of pure water increased to 30.2 \u00b0C. The results proved that the top of the floating PCMFe/600 was able to become a hot layer for generating steam. Besides, the neighboring water surface can be heated due to heat transfer from PCMFe/600. Figure 16 shows that the evaporation of pure water within 3600 s was 0.37 g, while the evaporation of water in the presence of the floating PCMFe/600 increased to 0.54 g under the same condition. The increase in water evaporation can be attributed to ISSG occurred on the hot surface of PCMFe/600.

To determine whether PCMFe/600 was simultaneously suitable for SSG and adsorption, the adsorption behavior of PCMFe/600 for MB was studied. The adsorption isotherm of MB on PCMFe/600 is shown in Fig. 17a, as can be seen, the increase in initial concentration of MB led to the increase of adsorption equilibrium, this was because the initial concentration provided a driving force for MB transferred from the aqueous phase to the surface of PCMFe/600. The inset of Fig. 17a shows the linear fitting of adsorption equilibrium data by Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models, and the best fitting model can be determined by the highest R2 value. R2 values and the isotherm parameters calculated from the slopes and intercepts can be seen in Table 4. Langmuir model had the best fitting, suggesting the formation of MB monolayer on the PCMFe/600 surface and no further adsorption occurred after the formation of the monolayer, and there was no MB molecules transmigrated in the plane of the neighboring surface. Moreover, each MB molecule had similar enthalpy and activation energy. Based on the Langmuir constant, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of PCMFe/600 for MB was calculated to be 70.9 mg g\u22121. The comparison of MB adsorption capacities of PCMFe/600 and some other waste-derived porous carbon materials are shown in Table 5. As can be seen, PCMFe/600 showed a competitive MB adsorption capacity, outperforming some other porous carbons in the literatures.",

PCMFe/600 kept floating on water surface with the help of EPE foam, then the beaker was sealed using parafilm and left undisturbed. As shown in Fig. 17b, the removal efficiency of MB by PCMFe/600 reached 77% within 5 days, and it continued to increase smoothly to nearly 100% on day 20. The adsorption rate was not as fast as that of a floatable carbon monoliths reported in a previous study [62, 67], and this was possibly because of the following reasons. First, PCMFe/600 needed more macro- and mesopores that provided channels for the fast diffusion of the MB dye to the active adsorption sites. Second, a stronger interaction between the functional groups on PCMFe/600 surface and MB molecules was required. Third, in the present study, the low initial concentration of MB solution provided limited driving force for mass transfer between the aqueous phase and solid medium. Besides, the MB solution was left undisturbed without stirring that can increasing contact between MB and PCMFe/600. The deficiencies of PCMFe/600 are pointed out, as well as the future research directions. Anyway, the floating PCMFe/600 was proved to be useful for absorbing the dissolved pollutants from water. Moreover, As can be seen from the inset, the MB-absorbed PCMFe/600 can be recovered from water via magnetic separation, and this phenomenon also reflected the potential of the floating PCMFe/600 being manipulated by magnetic force during its use. Based on the adsorption ability and magnetic response exhibited by the floating PCMFe/600, this material may find applications in pond water purification and environmental clean-up of oil spills.",

FeCl3 was helpful for the pyrolysis of WCCB at lower temperatures, and the activation energy was reduced by 76.63 kJ mol\u22121 because Lewis acidic Fe3+ promoted the breaking of glycosidic bonds of cellulose contained in WCCB. FeCl3 was also beneficial to char formation because the radicals released from WCCB during pyrolysis can be captured by Fe(III) species derived from FeCl3. Amorphous Fe(III) species in PCMs continuously converted into crystalline Fe3O4 when the carbonization temperature increased from 400 to 700 \u00b0C, and the carbothermal reduction of Fe3O4 at 800 \u00b0C led to the formation of \u03b1-Fe. Both the release of volatiles and etching of carbon contributed to the development of the porous structure of PCMs, and FeCl3 was favorable to the formation of micropores. The optimal sample (PCMFe/600) exhibited high optical absorption above 80% within a broadband wavelength, because it was rich in both sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and pores. The surface temperature of PCMFe/600 in dry state achieved 61.9 \u00b0C under 0.25 sun irradiation due to its good photothermal conversion ability. PCMFe/600-assisted water evaporation was 1.46 times that of the pure water because of the occurrence of interfacial solar-derived evaporation and heat island effect.
