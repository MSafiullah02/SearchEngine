            "text": "In December 2019, a series of patients with pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China [1]. The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. Even as we write this manuscript, nearly 500,000 confirmed cases have been identified worldwide, and nearly 25,000 people have died [2]. Experience from China demonstrates that with highly effective contact tracing and case isolation, outbreaks of COVID-19 can be brought under control within 3 months [3]. Healthcare workers are on the front lines of caring for patients with COVID-19 and have very high risk of exposure to the virus. Shortages of protective equipment and knowledge regarding COVID-19 are causing infections in healthcare workers [4]. As of February 11, 2020, more than 1700 healthcare workers have been infected in China [5]. In Italy, 2026 (9%) of the COVID-19 cases (as of March 15) occurred in healthcare workers [6]. However, there was no documented infection in 31 medical teams comprised of more than 42,000 doctors and nurses sent from other provinces to Hubei [7]. This strongly suggests that adequate knowledge about disease transmission and use of protective gear and infection control protocols are essential to prevent spread of infection among healthcare workers.",

Surgeons should prioritize urgent or emergency visits and procedures. Elective and nonurgent admissions should be rescheduled [8]. Patients who will face life-threatening consequences if treatment is delayed should be prioritized for outpatient visit, phone call, or virtual consultation by a member of the surgical team [9]. From China\u2019s experience, it is advisable to set up a separate triage area or fever clinic to screen for respiratory symptoms in any surgical patient. Patients with respiratory symptoms should call before they leave home, so staff can be prepared to care for them when they arrive [10]. Any patient with respiratory symptoms and flu-like symptoms should visit the fever clinic in advance. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be assigned private rooms with door closed [11] and should be provided surgical face masks or face masks without exhalation valve. Social distancing is essential within clinics and hospitals. Doctors and patients should stay 6 ft apart except during examinations; it may be necessary to forego all but the most essential elements of the physical exam to minimize risk of transmission.",

There is an urgent need for additional data to further identify risk factors for transmission during, before, and after surgery as well as to determine the optimal timing of surgery in these patients. The general principles outlined in this report will need to be considered in light of the local context, available resources, and the current activity of COVID-19.",
