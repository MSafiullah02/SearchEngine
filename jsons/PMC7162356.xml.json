PREVI Isola is a system for automated inoculation and streaking and is able to process any material from patients (liquid format). For urine samples we observed less sub culturing and earlier identification resulting in saving labor time and costs. The aim of this study was to explore the usefulness of the PREVI Isola for more difficult samples as feces and genital swabs.",

The clearly biofilm-negative C. parapsilosis strains focus near pI value of 3.8, while the pI value of the clearly biofilm-positive strains is near 3.6. The results of the CIEF correspond well with the cell surface hydrophobicity (p<0.001).",

In 8 isolates (seven from hospital A and one from hospital B) bla genes coding GES-type enzymes were identified. All found blaGES genes are located in class 1 integrons. Moreover, seven of them are present on plasmid. Among strains from hospital A enzymes as GES-1 (in 5 strains), GES-5 (in one) and the new ESBL-type \u03b2-lactamase GES-15 were detected. The complete nucleotide sequence of blaGES-15 was determined (NCBI GenBank Acc. No GU208678). Sequencing showed that GES-15 was identical to GES-5 except one amino acid. All of above-mentioned seven strains are resistant to ceftazidime and cefepime. The GES-15 carrying strain exhibited the most clear inhibitor-sensitive phenotype.

Genes conferring resistance to one of the MLS antibiotics may confer cross-resistance to others, because they have similar effects on bacterial protein synthesis. The high resistance to Q/D+E+C found in our strains is concordant with this hypothesis, and molecular tests are in progress. The chance that the large use of some macrolide (e.g. E) and lincosamide (e.g. C) antibiotics in animals increases the rate of S. aureus resistant to other MLS should be better evaluated in order to prevent the selection of multi-resistant strains. In particular, there is the risk that livestock becomes a reservoir of S. aureus resistant to some streptogramin, that are used very carefully in humans as the last chance for the treatment of infections not responding to other antibiotics.",

We recorded data pertinent to widely accepted risk factors for Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection considering events up to 30 days before the positive culture date.

The majority of prescribed indications (n = 1649) for ABs by both GPs and specialists were empirical treatments (53% and 44%, respectively). Specialists prescribed significantly more frequently ABs for microbiologically documented infections (25%) than GPs (14%, p<0.0001). Results on all AB treatments (n = 1666) showed that GPs prescribed significantly more frequently extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactam penicillins (J01CA, 11%) than specialists (6%, p = 0.0027). For GPs, 72% of the J01CA prescriptions were amoxicillin (J01CA04), compared to 53% of prescriptions by specialists. Combinations of penicillins and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (J01CR) were prescribed in similar amounts by GPs and specialists (14% and 15% respectively, p = 0.68). This was also the case for the prescription of quinolones (J01M) (14% by both, p = 0.94). Specialists prescribed cephalosporins (J01D) slightly more often than GPs (12% and 9%, respectively, p = 0.063). Finally, GPs and specialists prescribed other antimicrobials (J01X) in almost equal proportion (28% and 26%, respectively, p = 0.45). GPs opted in 94% of the cases for oral ABs.

Only 10 microL of DNA template were used for PCR. For that purpose were used 15 microL of reconstituted PCR mix which contained all that was needed for amplification of specific cfb gene of GBS which was the princip of the test. PCR reactions were performed in a termocycler with the following temperature profile: 1 cycle at 92\u00b0 for 1.5 min; 35 cycles consisted of three steps (92\u00b0 for 20 s; 55\u00b0 for 20 s; 72\u00b0 for 20 s); 1 cycle at 72\u00b0 for 2 min and 1 cycle at 95\u00b0 for 1 min.

Influenza type A is usually the most common of the circulating influenza types.

Yearly epidemics occur in part due to antigenic drift within these proteins. A novel Influenza A H1N1 subtype emerged in March 2009 and is the causative agent of the current influenza pandemic. The artus Infl./H1 LC/RG RT-PCR Kit is designed for the specific detection of all known Influenza A and B types, using primers and probes directed to regions of the matrix gene, as well as for the specific detection of a region of the hemagglutinin gene (H1) of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus.

However, oncogenic and nononcogenic groups can be closely related (A9 and A10) due to similarity in envelope genes. The molecular diagnostic is based in these genes and then show an analytical inaccuracy with cross-reactivity between groups. Hybrid capture 2 (hc2) (Qiagen) expresses the results of tested high-risk (HR) or low-risk (LR) HPV genotypes as positive or negative.

Two commercial PCR-based methods (Abbott Molecular and Beckton Dickinson) were performed for routine diagnostic of CT infection. An in-house TaqMan real time-PCR (qPCR) based in a deletion on the pmpH gene was used to specifically detect LGV related serovars (L1, L2 and L3).

To assess if acetylation of the tetracyclic region of ST affects its germination potential, a suspension-germination test system was designed which consisted of inoculating the derivatized germination solution with C. difficile ribotype 027 (2.6\u00d7106 cfu/mL). Control suspension-germination assays comprised 2% (w/v) non-derivatized ST in double strength thioglycollate germination solution. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature the samples were re-suspended in Wilkins-Chalgren anaerobic broth, and heated to 70\u00b0 for 10 minutes to eliminate spores which had germinated. Control suspensions were kept on ice. Suspensions were then inoculated onto fastidious anaerobic agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood agar and 0.1% ST and incubated at 37\u00b0 in anaerobic conditions. Total viable counts from the samples comprising derivatized sodium taurocholate and non-derivatized sodium taurocholate were then determined.",

Recent studies suggest an association between some subtypes of Blastocystis and acute diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome. However, few data are available regarding the prevalence and the genetic diversity of Blastocytis in France. This is probably due to the difficulty to point out Blastocystis in human feces. The anaerobic culture of fresh stool sample remains the gold standard method, but is heavy to set up for epidemiological studies. Direct microscopy of fecal smears is frequently used but exhibits a poor sensibility compared to the culture. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive real time PCR assay to detect Blastocystis directly from stools.

More than 75% of children had vomiting and 44% were dehydrated. Other symptoms included fever and abdominal pain. 62% of cases were reported between July and October. Four out of the six C. hominis cases have reported travel outside France prior to illness compared with 2 out of 17 for C. parvum. Conclusion: Few reports are available on frequency of cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent children in France and this study has demonstrated the public health importance of this parasite in Upper-Normandy. Cryptosporidiosis is likely to be unrecognized and underdiagnosed. Diagnostic testing for Cryptosporidium is rarely ordered, even when patients have symptoms consistent with cryptosporidiosis, leading to a lack of specific preventive initiatives to limit the overall health impact of cryptosporidiosis.",

Ten-fold dilutions of FK506 ranging from 1000 to 1\u00b5g/ml were assayed and voriconazole was added to YEPD agar plates at supra-MIC value (1 \u00b5g/ml). In order to induce resistance, the susceptible strain was exposed, in vitro, to sub-inhibitory concentrations of voriconazole (1\u00b5g/ml). Every day 1ml of culture broth was transferred to new fresh medium, with voriconazole (1\u00b5g/ml). Susceptibility profiles to voriconazole were assayed until acquisition of resistance. Flow cytometry assays using rhodamine 6G (Rd-6G) 5\u00b5M (an efflux pump fluorescent substrate) were performed in order to compare the resistant isolates (in vivo and in vitro induced) with the susceptible isolate, regarding the role of efflux pumps in C. krusei resistance.",

Oral ribavirin started quickly for the possible nosocomial transmission. The ribavirin dose was 2 g for loading, followed by 4 g/day for 4 days and 2 g/day for 3 days. She had no history of percutaneous exposure. Probably close contact with aerosolisation of blood or excretions are suspected route of transmission. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR.

She underwent C/T scan which revealed pleural effusions, ascites, a solid lesion of the right ovary and osteolytic and slerosing lesions of the lower thoracic vertebrae, and transvaginal ultrasound which showed a large cystic mass arising from the right ovary. Paracentesis of the ascites was performed; the fluid was an exudate with positive cytology for atypic cells, possibly adenocarcinoma, and negative for AFB. Gastroscopy and barium enema were normal. As the above findings suggested of an advanced ovarian cancer, laparotomy was performed; the macroscopic picture was of multiple whitish lesions over the peritoneum and the intestines (omental cake). Two liters of ascetic fluid were removed and an ADA test was done which came back positive: 55U/ml (13\u201323U/ml). The right ovary and salpynx were removed; the biopsy showed granulomatous tissue.

On admission, the patient complained of fatigue, WBC was 9.6\u00d7109/L, and CRP was 150 mg/L. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a 8mm vegetation on the tricuspid valve. Vancomycin was started empirically. On day 12 a Gram-negative spiral rod was recovered from blood cultures collected on the day of admission and day 2. The antibiotic was switched to ceftriaxone 2g once daily and gentamicin 80 mg after every haemodialysis for empirical coverage of Campylobacter fetus, a Gram-negative spiral rod known as a cause of IE. The organism grew on a blood agar at microaerophilic condition at 35 degrees Celsius but could not be identified at that time. Despite the administration of the antibiotics, fatigue and the level of CRP did not improve, ESR was elevated from 35 to 54 mm/hr, and the size of vegetation was increased to 17 mm.
