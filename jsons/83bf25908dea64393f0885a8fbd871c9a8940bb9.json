The viral genome is a monopartite, linear, polyadenylated positive ssRNA of 7.1-8.9 kb in length, including a single ORF encoding a large polyprotein 6,7 . To date, bat picornaviruses (BtPVs) discovered are associated to the Mischivirus, Hepatovirus, Crohivirus, Kunsagivirus, Kobuvirus and Shanbavirus genus or remain unassigned 8, 9 . To the best of our knowledge, M. schreibersii bats are the primary hosts regarding mischiviruses, which are classified in three distinct species, namely Mischivirus A 10 , Mischivirus B 11 , and Mischivirus C. However, new putative mischivirus sequences were described from both Romanian Myotis myotis and Myotis oxygnathus.

Additionally, the same substitution model was used to create a tree from P1 region of all BtPVs. Likewise, the GTR + G + I substation model was used to implement phylogeny based on P2 region and 3D pol gene of all BtPVs and their hosts. An amphibian picornavirus Ampivirus A sequence was used to root the viral phylogenies 9 , while Furipterus horrens CYTB sequence was used as a representative of the outgroup in the host tree.

The values obtained were interpreted according to Parker and colleagues 27 . This analysis compared the posterior distribution of trees regarding our data formerly mentioned, to a null distribution of 1000 trait-randomized trees.

The MC statistic supported the association for both Miniopterus (MC = 12, p = 0.001) and Hipposideros (MC = 3, p = 0.001) genera, in addition to the M. schreibersii species (MC = 12, p = 0.001).

Furthermore, the MC permitted an inspection in each geographic region alone and provided connecting proof for character-trait Europe (MC = 10, p = 0.009).

Likewise, we tallied six PV phylogenetic clusters for Miniopterus genus, five for Myotis, five for Rhinolophus, five for Eidolon, two for Hipposideros, two for Nyctalus, one for Coleura, and one for Ia. Since these BtPVs are related to different host species and sampled from varying locations, the number of RdRp sequences and/or host species within each cluster are different. Strikingly, several of the clusters are composed of a single BtPV RdRp sequence. A very strong correlation was observed among the number of BtPV specific clusters and both its species richness (r = 0.94; p = 0.0001), or geographical sampling area (r = 0.84; p = 0.002).

Chiropteran order was not included in the previous study. The main finding of the present study was the frequency regarding host-jumping events occurring in the evolutionary history of BtPVs, and reflected as incongruence between the virus and the host phylogeny. Furthermore, we could observe nearly all bat genera host phylogenetically divergent viruses and an absence of species specificity. According to studies performed on coronaviruses 14 it may likely be due to multiple introductions of PVs, this supposition is coherent with the detection of highly related PVs in humans and different animal species, such as the aichivirus 1 in humans 47 Cross-species transmission event occurrence is multifactorial, nevertheless, we concluded in some cases of BtPVs, sympatry may increase host-jumping events. Co-roosting of Myotis and Miniopterus bats may likely explain the detection of closely related kobuvirus associated among these bats 14 . The migratory ability of Miniopterus bats with the longest distance of 883 km recorded in Europe, which possibly eases the spread of viruses among bat populations spread out in geographically distant areas. For example, M. schreibersii, originating from Europe and Algeria, which possess different geographical distribution and share the same virus species Mischivirus B 54 .",
