A close antigenic relationship between this virus and FPV, a parvovirus of the cat, could be demonstrated. On the basis of this relationship, size and morphology of the particles, resistance to chloroform and the nature of the cytopathic changes caused in cell cultures, CPV appears to be a parvovirus. Using pre-and post-inoculation sera from an FPV-vaccinated and a non-vaccinated cat and also from nonvaccinated dogs, which were all experimentally infected with CPV, we were able to demonstrate a two-way cross-reactivity between CPV and FPV in HAI, IEM, IF and S N tests. Although CPV and FPV are closely related, they agglutinate a different spectrum of erythrocytes: CPV agglutinates AGM, cat and swine erythrocytes at 4 OC and FPV only agglutinates swine probably also distinguish CPV from the previously isolated canine parvovirus MVC, which failed to show cross-reactivity with FPV in HA1 tests (15) . Another difference between CPV and FPV may be the cell spectrum in which both viruses multiply: CPV did multiply in both MDCK and CrFK cells, although higher titers Qf infectivity were found in the homologous system, whereas FPV could only be propagated in the latter (OSTERHAUS, unpublished observations). However, this could be a matter of adaptation. A practical implication of the close antigenic relationship between CPV and FPV might be the protection of dogs from CPV infections by vaccination with FPV vaccines. Apart from a mild leukopenia and teniperature rise disease symptoms resembling feline panleukopenia were absent in the non-vaccinated cat after experimental infection with cell culture propagated CPV. It is not unlikely that environmental conditions and secondary bacterial infections may be im ortant in the pathogenesis as was shown for feline panleukopenia (13). d i s is also suggested by the fact that the two dogs did not develop any overt clinical symptoms after experimental infection with CPV, although also in these animals virus multiplication was evidenced by seroconversion. However, the potential role played by this virus in the etiology of contagious diarrhea is suggested by various reports from all over the world, associating a similar virus with outbreaks of diarrhea in the dog. Moreover, in a large number of fecal samples from dogs in the Netherlands, screened during the last few years no parvovirus-like particles were observed (unpublished observations), whereas almost all stools collected from dogs involved in the outbreaks described above were positive. As in mink virus enteritis (for review see 15), a virus closely related to FPV seems to cause a canine viral enteritis. It is still an open question why infections with CPV occurred apparently suddenly in many parts of the worl'd. Serological and clinical data from the Netherlands, and also from the USA (4), suggest that infections date only from the last few years.",
