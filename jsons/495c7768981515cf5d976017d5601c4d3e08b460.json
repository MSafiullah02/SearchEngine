Baculoviruses are restricted to arthropod hosts, and most infect lepidopteran insects. Baculoviruses of subgroups A and B have a unique survival strategy in that they use two phenotypes to complete an infection cycle in nature. One phenotype, made environmentally stable by its inclusion within a crystalline proteinic matrix, initiates infection in midgut cells after being ingested by a susceptible insect host. The other phenotype amplifies the infection systemically, and matures by budding from the plasma membrane of infected cells as enveloped single nucleocapsids. The budded virus (BV) differs from the occluded virus in many ways (75). One significant difference is that BV has a major surface antigen, a phosphoglycoprotein of 64,000 mol wt (64K) that functions in the efficient entry of BV by adsorptive endocytosis (17, 18) . This protein is largely, if not totally, responsible for the significantly greater efficiency of infection of BV relative to the occluded form both in the insect hemocoel and in cell culture (6, 74) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 896, "end": 900, "text": "(17,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 901, "end": 904, "text": "18)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "(6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1105, "text": "74)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus"}, {"text": "In this study, we document the effects of trypsin and proteinase K on 64K of AcMNPV BV and compare protease-treated and untreated virus with regard to changes in infectivity after exposure to various biological and chemical reagents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus"}, {"text": "The cell lines used in this study, IPLB-SF-21 and TN-368, were derived from Spodoprera frugiperde and Tri-' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus"}, {"text": "chop/Ma ni, respectively (16).

These studies resulted in the hypothesis that the function of the 64K protein is to allow efficient entry of BV by adsorptive endocytosis. Because proteolytic cleavage renders BV nonneutralizable by AcV, but does not reduce infectivity, it occurred to us that such a cleavage of 64K might be a normal part of the infection process after adsorption of BV to susceptible host cells. Natural proteolytic cleavage of surface glycoproteins has been shown for several enveloped viruses, including paramyxo, myxo, and coronaviruses (3, 7, 8, . This cleavage frequently plays an important role in viral infectivity and host specificity. If such a cleavage takes place in the course of AcMNPV BV infection, we reasoned that it might take place in and be dependent on the acidic environment of endocytic vesicles, We were interested, therefore, in determining whether protease-treated BV infectivitiy was sensitive to inhibition by chloroquine, a lipophilic amine that prevents the acidification of endosomes. This was done by performing infectivity assays in the presence of 1 mhllchloroquine as described previously (17). The results in Fig. 5 show that infection of both IPLB-SF-21 and TN-368 cells by protease-treated BV is sensitive to chloroquine. Cleavage of 64K does not release BV from the requirement of functionally entering cells via acidic endosomes.
