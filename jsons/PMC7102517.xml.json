After tracheal intubation, the outer layer gloves were removed, and the inner gloves were disinfected with hydrogen peroxide solution again. Then, anesthesiologists wore a disposable surgical gown and sterile gloves to complete the internal jugular vein cannulation, and connect the cannula to the pressure measuring device (Fig 1\n). A nasal temperature probe was placed before heparinization. Finally, a clean drape was placed over the patient's head and face, and the eyes were taped shut to prevent corneal abrasions.",

Applying anti-fog agents on protective goggles in advance can effectively reduce the fogging and water accumulation from breath and sweat evaporation. Long procedures increase the risk of perioperative aerosol infections; therefore, the authors recommend the use of medical adhesive tape to strengthen the connection between the goggles and mask, between the goggles and the protective clothing cap, and between the mouth and nose of the protective clothing to effectively prevent an insufficient seal.
