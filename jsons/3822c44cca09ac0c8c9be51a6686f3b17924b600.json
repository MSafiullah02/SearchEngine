[3, 4] It was postulated that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be the plausible explanation of this association.

Our hypothesis is that DM is associated with poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression that comprehensively describe the association between DM and outcome in COVID-19.",

[6] Severe COVID-19 was defined as patients who had any of the following features at the time of, or after, admission: (1) respiratory distress (\u226530 breaths per min); (2) oxygen saturation at rest \u226493%; (3) ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fractional concentration of oxygen inspired air (fiO2) \u2264300 mmHg; or (4) critical complication (respiratory failure, septic shock, and or multiple organ dysfunction/failure).

Age and prevalence of hypertension was inversely proportional with the effect of DM on poor outcome. In other words, the effect estimate of DM was less in older and hypertensive patients. Subgroup analysis further demonstrates the vast difference in RR. Meta-regression also showed that age and prevalence of hypertension seemed to be dependent on one another, this is further demonstrated by subgroup analysis showing that the RR for age <55 years-old, prevalence of hypertension <25%, and both of them combined varies only slightly. The association between DM (as a single risk factor) with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 was greater in younger people and without hypertension). The presence of older age and hypertension may attenuate the association of DM with composite poor outcome. Hence, the total risk is expected to be higher in older patients with HT, but the magnitude of DM as a single risk factor is greater in younger people without hypertension.",

            "text": "It is not yet known whether people with DM are more susceptible to COVID-19, but several studies have reported a greater risk of severe COVID-19 in diabetic patients. [3, 4] Diabetic individuals have a greater risk of respiratory infections due to compromised immune system, especially the innate immunity. [5, 37] Even transient hyperglycaemia may temporarily affect innate immune responses to infection. [38] It was hypothesized that ACE2 may be the key pathfinder of COVID-19 severity in diabetic individuals. [5] ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein expressed in the epithelial cells of cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, brain and intestinal tissue, it acts by breaking down angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7. [37, 39, 40] This enzyme acts by counteracting the inflammatory actions of angiotensin II, lowering the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6, increasing the anti-inflammatory, and increasing the antioxidant action of angiotensin 1-7, escalating the levels of surfactant protein D and promoting vasodilation. [41] The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 is expected to act similary to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Both utilize ACE2 to bind and gain entry to the host pneumocytes. [39] Viral surface spike (S) protein of COVID-19 binds to ACE2 after spike protein activation by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). [40] Routine use of ACEI and ARB as a medication for chronic conditions upregulates ACE2 expression, [5, 37] thereby facilitating entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the pneumocytes and consequently cause severe and fatal infection. [42] Among other diabetic medications, the use of liraglutide and pioglitazone have also been found to be related with increased ACE2 regulation in animal studies. [42, 43] The interconnection between ACE2, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signalling, aging, DM, hypertension, and severity of COVID-19 may not be as simple as it may seem. As we described before, our meta-regression analysis showed that the association between DM and poor outcome was interdependent on age and hypertension. One of the possible rationale behind this finding is the use of medications, particularly ACEI or ARB in hypertensive individuals. The risks and benefits associated with ACEI/ARB use in COVID-19 patients remains controversial [44] , a specific type of ARB has been shown to ameliorate lung injury in SARS-CoV infection in animal model. [45] It is unfortunate that all of the included studies did not provide report on diabetic or hypertensive medications.",

[46] Older hypertensive individuals have lower ACE2 levels but a higher RAS signalling, this difference is further expressed in COVID-19 patients in which ACE2 developed into a critically low levels and RAS signalling is exaggerated even more. Such disturbance result in a potentially decreased susceptibility to the disease, but a greater severity. In contrast, younger people without hypertension have higher ACE2 levels and lower RAS signalling, which transforms into a modestly low ACE2 levels and modestly increased RAS signalling due to COVID-19 infection. This results in a possibly increased susceptibility to the disease, but a lesser severity. Our meta-regression result may support the aforementioned hypothesis. The use of ACEI/ARB is expected in patients with both DM and HTN; and we observe that the age and HTN were in parallel, studies with older subjects having higher prevalence of hypertension. Hence, the clinical significance of DM in the older patients may be attenuated by the risk of hypertension and ACEI/ARB use (which was hypothesized to increase severity in older patients).",
