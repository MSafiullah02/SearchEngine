These outbreaks are increasingly characterized by the small elapsed time between initial infections in a single region to the global epidemic state affecting different cities, regions, countries, and, in some cases, continents. Thus, in recent years a great effort has been devoted to understanding the fast unfolding of emergent diseases and to design both local and global contention strategies. The most common avenue to tackle this problem is to adapt classical epidemic models taking into account the multiscale nature of diseases propagation [1,2].",

However, in order to understand the geographical diffusion of diseases, one has to combine these microscopic contagion processes with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. To tackle this problem, epidemic modeling has relied on reaction-diffusion dynamics in metapopulations, a family of models first used in the field of population ecology [3\u20137]. For the case of epidemic modeling, the usual metapopulation scenario [8\u201310] is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, with the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well mixed; i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second ingredient of metapopulation frameworks concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. The mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.",

In the past decade, important steps towards the inclusion of realistic mobility structures have been made [13\u201316]. These approaches had to compromise between realism and analytical feasibility. On one side, lengthy mechanistic simulations [1,17] provide fair predictions on realistic scenarios while, on the other, theoretical frameworks allowing for analytical results usually rely on strong assumptions limiting their applicability to real-world threats. For instance, it is usual to assume simplified mobility patterns and mean-field approximations for hosts\u2019 and patches\u2019 behavior to be able to predict the onset of an outbreak. In these models, random diffusion of agents between the nodes is often used as a proxy of human mobility while, as in the heterogeneous mean field in contact networks [18], subpopulations with identical connectivity are assumed to be equally affected by the disease.",

Multiplex networks [31\u201335] consist of a set of L networks (usually called layers) and a set of N nodes. Each node is represented once in each network layer, allowing it to share different connectivity patterns in each of the L layers. In terms of metapopulation models, for which nodes account for geographical locations, each layer represents the mobility network of each type of agent, while each subpopulation is represented in each layer. This way, the multiplex formalism captures the coexistence, within each subpopulation, of different types of agents with different mobility preferences. These differences can account for age-specific mobility habits (capturing different preferences in the locations visited) or the socioeconomic segregation of residences and work places across urban areas. In these cases, the diverse mobility patterns corresponding to each agent type affect in different ways the onset of epidemics.",

These classes are represented as a multiplex metapopulation of six layers, each one encoding the demography as well as the mobility patterns of each class. We analyze the spread of diseases over this real configuration and introduce quantifiable measures to shed light on the influence of the social mixing among socioeconomic classes and mobility on the critical properties of the epidemic onset. The interplay between socioeconomical mixing and mobility produces nontrivial effects with strong consequences on the criticality of the epidemics. Specifically, the localization of the epidemics changes abruptly as a consequence of this interplay, having interesting consequences in the design of epidemic containment policies.",

The monotonous decrease of \u03bbc(p) corroborates that, for these three synthetic multiplexes, mobility enhances the spread of the disease. Interestingly, for the case of noninteracting layers, the epidemic threshold of the ER-SF and SF-SF multiplexes follows the same dependence on the mobility. This result indicates that it is the layer with the smallest threshold, the SF one (see Fig. 12 in Appendix A), the one driving epidemic outbreaks. However, as the interlayer coupling increases, the two layers interplay and the ER-SF and SF-SF metapopulations behave differently.

(20) in a real case, let us focus on the analysis of the role that socioeconomic mixing has on the epidemic threshold for the city of Medell\u00edn. In Fig. 9(a), we show the surface \u03bbc(p,\u03b3) calculated from the supramatrix M\u2032 obtained from the data of the city of Medell\u00edn. From this surface it becomes evident that an increase of social mixing \u03b3 always leads to a decrease of the epidemic threshold since \u03b3 promotes the number of contacts taking place inside each subpopulation. Regarding the role that mobility plays, it becomes clear that, for all the values of the interlayer coupling, increasing the agents\u2019 movements always has a detrimental effect on the onset of epidemics, which is identified by an increase of the epidemic threshold. Both factors then can counterbalance each other and will be responsible of interesting nontrivial effects on the criticality of the epidemics. The pattern observed in the surface \u03bbc(p,\u03b3) points out a nontrivial dependence of the epidemic threshold with the mobility for small values of the social mixing \u03b3. This dependence is better visualized in Figs. 9(b) and 9(c), where we show the curves \u03bbc(p) for several \u03b3 values and their counterpart, i.e, the curves \u03bbc(\u03b3) for several values of p.",

The existence of different localizations vmax depending on the mobility is crucial for designing efficient policies to ameliorate the onset of diseases since the particular contribution of each subpopulation encoded in the components of vmax allows us to apply targeted immunization strategies. Specifically, as the patches in the metapopulation of Medell\u00edn correspond to neighborhoods, identifying the largest components of vmax helps us to identify the most critical urban areas.

Additionally, the multiplex formalism allows us to study the mixing among the different socioeconomic classes in Medell\u00edn using a single parameter (intensity of the interlayer link). An exhaustive analysis of the epidemic threshold reveals that, when mixing between different socioeconomic classes is small, there is a sudden change in the localization components of the eigenvector controlling the epidemic onset as mobility increases. This transition implies that the set of subpopulations triggering the spread of the disease changes abruptly, and can be detected. Moreover, we derive an indicator that is the effective number of contacts of the agents of one agent from a given patch and class. This indicator, which only depends on the underlying multiplex metapopulation, allows us to determine the drivers nodes and, more importantly, the transition points where the abrupt changes in the localization of epidemic outbreaks occur.
