The majority of included patients (48 981 subjects) in the review\n1\n was extracted from studies that did not describe accurately the clinical presentation.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n The largest report on 44 672 confirmed COVID\u201019 patients focused on critical cases and on the case\u2010fatality rate, without a detailed presentation of the symptoms.\n2\n Yang et al\n3\n showed limited data and we were able to download only a two pages manuscript. Sun et al\n4\n described only age and sex on included patients. On the contrary, other studies that described the full symptoms spectrum of COVID\u201019 found that pharyngodynia was not rare. The sore throat was reported to be present in 5% to 17.4% of COVID\u201019 patients.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n Guan et al\n6\n in a large series of 1099 COVID\u201019 patients found pharyngodynia in 13.9% of cases.",

            "text": "At this stage of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, it is fundamental to inform correctly health care providers. Real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assays were the standard for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) from respiratory secretions collected by nasal and oropharyngeal swabs.\n8\n A high false\u2010negative rate (FNR) has been reported for these tests. Results from quantitative RT\u2010PCR could be affected by the variation of viral RNA sequences or by the viral load in different anatomic sites during the disease natural history.\n8\n By estimate, FNR from one\u2010time testing was high as 30% to 50% in real COVID\u201019 cases.\n8\n A recent report on 1014 COVID\u201019 cases found that only 59% of patients had positive SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 swabs at presentation, while chest computed tomography had higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID\u201019.\n9\n Consequently, the clinical presentation could be helpful in identifying suspected COVID\u201019 cases and we think that sore throat should not be considered a rare symptom as reported by Sun et al.\n1\n This could lead to undiagnosed cases and to the spread of infection. Patients with the suspected disease should be isolated (use of individual rooms was recommended, with negative pressure if possible), and health personnel should use waterproof gowns, gloves, goggles, and surgical masks or FFP2 masks.\n10\n Further studies are needed to clarify the importance of pharyngodynia in COVID\u201019.",
