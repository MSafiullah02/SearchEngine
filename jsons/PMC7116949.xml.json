In 2006, an interdisciplinary panel consisting of experts in medicine, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental chemistry, aerosol sciences, psychology, engineering and architecture reviewed the effects of ventilation on health in non-industrial indoor environments [13]. The group judged that 27 of the total 365 papers studied concurred that ventilation rates are associated with sick building syndrome (SBS), especially in offices. Furthermore, the group also highlighted the need for ventilation and health studies in warm and humid climates and polluted and public localities. Moreover, a list of 40 studies between 1960 and 2005 were appraised by another multidisciplinary panel. Subsequently, they also recognised that 10 studies have put forward substantial facts that show the relationship between ventilation and proliferation of infectious diseases, such as influenza and TB [14].",

The number of beds in a ward differs from one facility to another. Therefore, the configuration of a multiple-bed hospital ward can range from 2 people per ward up to 30 people per ward in many localities, including Malaysia. Additionally, it is not uncommon to subdivide the ward into multiple units that hold 4 patients or up to 6 patients. Another practice is to have 1 patient per room as stipulated in [5], which is particularly common in the United States. However, multiple-bed configurations with defined limitations are allowed for the intensive care unit and critical care unit. Compared with other clinical spaces such as operating rooms and isolation rooms, which are studied thoroughly, the aforementioned spaces are limited to one person and a few healthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses. Depending on the activities conducted and the affected floor area of a ward, these spaces are much more constrained compared with operating theatres. Furthermore, multiple-bed hospital wards require lower capital expenditure, which is why they are more widely used in developing countries compared with single-patient rooms.",

This type of ward caters up to 30 adults or 24 children and is still widely used in many developing countries.

Comfort also depends on occupants\u2019 clothing, activity and air movements. In addition to these variables, patients\u2019 physical strength also influences their thermal comfort needs. A study by Hwang et al. [26] has shown the dissimilarity in thermal comfort perception and comfort range against the ASHRAE Standard 55. More than 75% of the respondents were neutral in their preferences, even when there was only a 40% conformance to ASHRAE recommendations of comfort zone. This view is also consistent with the findings of Nicol [27] and Mallick [28]. Nicol [27] presented evidence and methods that complement existing standards, such as ISO 7730, using adaptive thermal comfort standards derived from local subjective measurements. With this criterion, the comfort range can be above or below 2\u20133 \u00b0C of the optimal figure and be considered satisfactory. In addition, Mallick [28] suggested that for people in a warm humid climate, comfort perceptions are governed by local acclimatisation to high temperatures and humidity. As a result from his study, the comfort temperature range is between 24 \u00b0C and 32 \u00b0C with relative humidity values between 50% and 90% with or without air movements in the selected space.",

Additionally, clean room technology standards are being recommended to select the bacterial threshold limits in operating rooms [38]. Ho et al.

Consequently, supply grilles, which are located at the centre of the room, showed better effectiveness. This result again confirmed that airflow patterns substantially influence the efficacy of thermal comfort and pollutant removals. Furthermore, Rui et al.

It was concluded that it is impossible to produce unidirectional flow according to the CDC recommendation of 4 ACH. Similarly, Philips et al. [43] demonstrated that it is not easy to ensure that an entire room space achieves the 12 ACH requirements even with a 15 ACH supply rate to the room, and the minimum ACH rate does not adequately ventilate the room. Additionally, the use of age-of-contaminant for comparing the efficiency of different ventilation solutions was recommended. Bryant also reiterated on the intricacy of the airflow and aerosol dispersion patterns within an isolation room and highlighted the importance of protecting the hospital staff that treat patients with infectious disease [44].",

Furthermore, another study was conducted utilising a CFD simulation to investigate the effects of a moving person and the movement of a sliding door in an isolation room.
