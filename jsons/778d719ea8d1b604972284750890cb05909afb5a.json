On 30th January 2020, the WHO declared the Chinese outbreak of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern posing a high risk to countries with vulnerable health systems (3). To date many countries in the world in different continents was involved in COVID-19 and its complications and it became a pandemic disease. Most patients with COVID-19 have developed mild symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, fatigue and fever. The majority of cases have spontaneously resolved. However, some patients developed fatal complications such as organ failure, septic shock and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and finally died (4).",
