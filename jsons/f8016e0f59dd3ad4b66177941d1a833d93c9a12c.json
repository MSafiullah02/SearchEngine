            "text": "We are in the midst of a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first detected in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. Since then, COVID-19 has spread quickly, with more than 2,000,000 confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths on April 19, with 213 countries involved worldwide. 1 Given the serious public health risk, medical practice has consistently changed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak might change in relation to the diffusion of the virus, as well as the health system of the individual country; furthermore, this pandemic is influencing different medical specialties in a variety of ways. 2 Most surgical subspecialties are not primarily involved in fighting the disease itself, but they must still change their organization, as most national and international societies suggest stopping all elective activity, maintaining only emergent and urgent procedures. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Neurosurgeons might feel fairly useless during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, international guidelines have been introduced calling for a tailored triage according to the degree of emergency, 3, 9, 10 and we believe that sharing information about the organization of neurosurgical activity throughout the world might be helpful at this time. Furthermore, it might be interesting to investigate whether there is any association between the level of infection and consequent country reorganization of the neurosurgical system, as well as the neurosurgeons' practice. We, therefore, conducted an online survey that was submitted to neurosurgeons worldwide between March 28 and April 5, 2020 through the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) 11 and the Neurosurgery Cocktail.

            "text": "Italy and India were the countries with the most respondents ( Fig. 1 ). This finding is independent of the incidence of disease, as shown in Figure 2 . Conversely, the US was the country with least number of respondents in relation to the incidence of disease during the study period. Although it might be tempting to relate the number of answers to perception of the health emergency, we should point out that the survey circulated widely among neurosurgeons, but we cannot state that the percentage of respondents (i.e. respondents/non respondents) was the same among the different nations. The same correlation was found with regards to the medical perception of disease activity (Q2) in different countries, and only few respondents (3%) claimed their country was not facing the outbreak during the time period studied: among them, neurosurgeons from Germany were probably the most \"wrong\", since their country had between 10 4 to 10 5 SARS-CoV2 patients during the study period (Fig. 4A) . Notably, reactions and perceptions of COVID-19 impact on a country may be consistently driven by government actions, as happened in India and Pakistan, where most strict lockdown measures were undertaken with respect to other world countries, 17, 18 possibly influencing general and health professional awareness of the health emergency. Nonetheless, the differences in number of responses might be due to a heterogeneity of the survey distributions among different countries. Furthermore, the perception of the emergency might be related to the health system, with Germany having the highest rate of ICU beds/population. 19 Regarding the time-length perception of COVID-19, Italian and Iranian respondents perceived the start of the health emergencies much earlier than the actual one (Fig. 3) ; Chinese neurosurgeons, instead, located the start of the health emergency almost at the inflection point of decrease in incidence rate, when the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was about to reach the plateau phase (Fig. 3) . The perception corresponded well to reality among the other respondents. It is tempting to interpret these data as the consequence of the strain that physicians are experiencing in countries with the longest disease involvement at the moment of the study: some might perceive that the emergency is longer than reality due to the continuous stress, or because of media pressure about other countries (i.e. China and Iran) experiencing the outbreak. On the other hand, accumulating evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 might have been circulating in Italy well before February 21st, thus explaining the significant outbreak that took place in Lombardy in northern Italy. 20 Others may perceive that the emergency is shorter than reality due to epidemiology for complex reasons: Chinese people outside Wuhan experienced the outbreak at a later stage of the epidemic and individuals emigrating from Wuhan was the main infection source for other provinces, causing a rapid increase in case load when Wuhan was already in the plateau phase; the general perception in China about the national involvement might have been in reality delayed. 21 Health system organization With respect to health system organization, the most frequent action undertaken globally was reduction of surgical activity without centralization (79%, yellow bars on Fig. 4B ). Significant high rates were registered in India (81%) and Pakistan (85%). Centralization of surgery to high-volume centers was reported in only 9% cases and Italy was the country with the highest number of positive respondents (23%), followed by Germany (6%) and India (5%). Only 7% of respondents report that their country did not undertake any special measure. These data show how most countries acted according to international guidelines in the management of elective procedures. 5 India and Pakistan have been reported to be the world's best respondents to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, 22-24 thus reflecting high rates of neurosurgical activity reorganizations. Neurosurgical centers should undertake national and regional measures to meet patients' needs with logistical capabilities, as reported by guidelines. 3 Interestingly, health reorganization may vary signficantly even within the same country. More than 100,000 positive cases were confirmed in Italy by April 19 with more than 30,000 in Lombardy alone. 20 In this region, which is still at the center of the health emergency in Italy, neurosurgical departments were urgently reorganized and centralization of surgery in highvolume centers was decided. [6] [7] [8] Other Italian regions are still facing the health emergency, but at lower levels with incidences that tend to decrease from the north to the south. 20 The same incidence disproportion between regions within a country is clearly visible in even smaller european countries such as Switzerland, where the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva account for more than 4,000 cases each, while the Canton of Schaffhausen has not yet reached 100 cases. 25 These significant variations in a single country justify the different regional reorganizations.",

Some respondents (21%, mainly from Austria, Germany, and UK) reported not taking any special measures for SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, guidelines clearly state that SARS-CoV-2 positive patients should be cohorted in a separate location from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and specific hospital policy for management of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the operating room should be developed. [31] [32] Concerning the screening of neurosurgical patients, facilities should use portable radiography when chest X-Rays are considered necessary, thus avoiding the need to bring patients into radiography departments; chest CT scan has been recently reported to have a high sensitivity (97%) for COVID-19 screening, but lower specificity and accuracy. 33, 34 A recently published paper in JAMA analyzed the sensitivity of different RT-PCR screening sources demonstrating that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the most sensitive specimen (93%), followed by sputum (72%), nasal swab (63%), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%), feces (29%), and blood (1%); the authors underline that multiple testing from different sites improve sensitivity and reduces false-negative results. 35 Most guidelines at present recommend a single upper respiratory nasopharyngeal swab for suspect cases. 2 In this survey, most respondents referred that nasopharyngeal swab was the preferred method for screening (86%), followed by CT scan (26%), and chest X-ray (25%). Some respondents indicated more than one screening method, especially those from Italy (57%) and India (19%), where the most common combination was the nasopharyngeal swab with chest X-ray.",

We must indeed stress that all medical efforts, institutional plans, and health system organization would be useless without the appropriate and recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE). 26,36,37 Although India is the world's second most populous country, the incidence rate of SARS-COV-2 infections has risen less than other countries since the beginning of the outbreak. 38 The reason might be found in the earlier government actions that India undertook while the virus was spreading out from China. 17, 18, 39 Limits of the study Our study has many limits. First, it is not an epidemiological study and does not allow drawing conclusions about the actual prevalence and incidence of the variables investigated. It does allow, though, to draw conclusions regarding the perception of neurosurgeons about the COVID-19 health emergency with respect to the actual epidemiology data. Second, although this survey spread out widely among neurosurgeons, respondents were mostly from Italy, India and Pakistan, while the rest of the world was represented with lesser numbers. Heterogeneity of the survey's percentage of respondents (i.e. respondents/non-respondents) among different countries might have biased some responses.",
