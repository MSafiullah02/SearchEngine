Similar to coronavirus itself, few are immune to medical treatment rumors which can wreak havoc on critical decisions made with limited information. The COVID-19 pandemic occurs in the social media era, allowing for swift propagation of unproven clinical care guidelines and overt misinformation. Proposed treatment strategies have been amplified and distorted according to testimonials rather than scientific rigor. While social media offers interconnectedness, real-time communication, and advocacy opportunities, it also has unintended consequences.",

These drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against coronavirus.1 However, the therapeutic effect of these drugs in patients with COVID-19 remains speculative at best.2 Basic science research has been broadly extrapolated by media, politicians, and even physicians as evidence of prophylaxis and treatment against COVID-19. Clinicians are prescribing these drugs against COVID-19 to such a degree that pharmacies are reporting shortages.2 These drugs have known dangerous adverse effects (such as QTc prolongation, seizures, hypokalemia, and death) as well as properties which may theoretically exacerbate COVID-19 (immunosuppression and interaction with other drugs). Sadly, these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index and there have already been poisoning fatalities and critical illnesses related to their use against COVID-19.3",

That year the surgeon general supported aspirin for influenza treatment, recommending doses from 1.0 to 1.3 g every one to three hours.4 We now know that this dosing regimen is expected to cause life-threatening toxicity, especially in a patient with respiratory insufficiency caused by influenza pneumonia. An epidemiological analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic concludes the likelihood that a significant portion of fatalities were due to aspirin poisoning.4 The noblest intentions healed none and harmed many.",

Without a control group, this rate of positive outcome translates to apparent efficacy of any treatment, including placebo. For example, if 10 patients receive a placebo, the probability of all ten surviving is (97.3%)10 = 76%. In order to demonstrate a 25% mortality reduction from 2.7 to 2.03% with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, a randomized placebo-control trial would need to enroll 16,146 patients.
