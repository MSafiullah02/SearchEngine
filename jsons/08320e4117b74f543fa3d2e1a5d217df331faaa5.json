Microorganisms establish compositionally complex communities on the leaf surface. The microbiome of phyllosphere is rich in diversity of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, and viruses. The diversity, dispersal, and community development on the leaf surface are based on the physiochemistry, environment, and also the immunity of the host plant. A colonization process is an important event where both the microbe and the host plant have been benefited. Microbes commonly established either epiphytic or endophytic mode of life cycle on phyllosphere environment, which helps the host plant and functional communication with the surrounding environment. To the scientific advancement, several molecular techniques like metagenomics and metaproteomics have been used to study and understand the physiology and functional relationship of microbes to the host and its environment. Based on the available information, this chapter describes the basic understanding of microbiome in leaf structure and physiology, microbial interactions, especially bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, and their adaptation in the phyllosphere environment. Further, the detailed information related to the importance of the microbiome in phyllosphere to the host plant and their environment has been analyzed.

The global leaf area corresponds to both upper and lower surfaces, has approximately twice as great as the land surface area (Vorholt 2012) . The phyllosphere is the ambient region for microbes to colonize and establish its association with plants usually epiphytes. Microbial communities in the phyllosphere are highly complex and consist of many cultured and uncultured microorganisms (M\u00fcller and Ruppel 2014) . It has a heterogeneous group of the microbial association at the micrometer scale area due to its diverse microenvironments (habitats). The phyllospheric microbes are adapted to the insensitive environmental conditions, specifically microbial epiphytes are highly exposed to atmospheric temperature, light, UV radiation, less water, and nutrient availability. These external factors affect the composition and diversity of phyllospheric microbial communities (Vorholt 2012) . However, the type of plant and invading microbial populations (pathogens) are also influencing the commensals and/or mutualistic relationship with their host plant (Lindow and Brandl 2003) . Less number of studies are available for the microbiology of phyllosphere rather than plant root. Moreover, with increasing anthropogenic stresses, the diversity and community structure of phyllosphere microflora have been continually modified.

The epidermis involves many regulatory processes of leaf physiology including gas exchange, temperature regulation, primary production, secretion of secondary metabolites, and water mobilization. Also, a specialized epidermal cell such as stomata, hydathodes (modified stomata), and trichomes (outgrowth) are there in the epidermis. The stomata are surrounded by two cupped hand cells called guard cells, which may open or close due to internal water pressure. Inside the leaf, a layer of cells called the mesophyll, is present, usually two layers, namely, palisade layer and the spongy layer. They contain chlorophyll and photosynthesis occurs in these cells. The palisade cells are more column cells and the spongy cells are more loosely packed between the palisade layer and the lower epidermis, and it allows for gas exchange. The veins of the leaf contain the vascular tissue, xylem and phloem are found in it. Veins run from tips of the roots and are extended up to the edges of the leaves. The outer layer cells are called bundle sheath Glandular trichome of the epidermis releases a wide spectrum of leaf exudates, such as polysaccharide salts, lipids, volatile compounds, and proteins, and its function is associated with plant-microbe and plant-insect interactions (Hirano and Upper 1983) .

The presence of outer cuticle and its physiology help the microbes to colonize this site. Presence of aliphatic compounds in the cuticle layer determines the physicochemical properties of the leaf surface and renders the permeability and wettability, which facilitate the adherence of microorganisms (Sadler et al. 2016) . Water permeability of this site may play a vital role in the survival and growth of the epiphytes. Moreover, leaching the nutrients along with water makes the epiphytes to utilize and develop colonies on the phyllosphere (Burch et al. 2014) . The leaf surface with higher water and nutrient penetration is heavily colonized by bacterial communities (Beattie 2011) . In general, bacteria maintain the cuticular permeability by secretion of biosurfactants, for example, Pseudomonas syringae release syringafactin on the cuticle layer of the leaf which facilitate the availability of sugar for persistent epiphytic growth (Van der Wal and .

The culture-independent approaches like 16S rDNA sequences of the whole microbial mass of phyllosphere could give the complete and complex microbial community structure of the environment. Molecular studies suggested that alpha-, beta-and gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes are the dominant bacterial inhabitants of the phyllosphere.

There are several reports revealed that phyllosphere fungi have a profound role in the residing host. Both epiphytic and endophytic fungi inhabiting the leaf are of high species diversity with diverse metabolic functions (Yao et al. 2019) , such as leaf litter decomposition and recycling the carbon and nitrogen (Kannadan and Rudgers 2008; Guerreiro et al. 2018) . In general, endophytic fungi can help plant growth and also provide resistance to biotic (pathogens) and abiotic (drought and salinity) stresses, (Arnold et al. 2007; Purahong and Hyde 2011; Guerreiro et al. 2018; Yadav et al. 2018c ). In culturedependent approaches, several fungal species have been isolated from small herbs to larger woody plants. In\u00e1cio et al. (2010) reported that the density of yeast-like fungi may vary from plant to plant and approximately 5 \u00d7 10 4 cells cm \u22122 . Aureobasidium pullulans are yeast-like fungi abundant in phyllosphere (Cordier et al. 2012; Setati et al. 2012) . Apart from yeast-like fungi, many filamentous fungi have been reported from health as well as infected plant leaves. Through the culture-dependent method, Ripa et al. (2019) (Rodriguez et al. 2009; Porras-Alfaro and Bayman 2011) , and some endophytes later turned to pathogens. The olive tree phyllosphere is found to be highly diverse having more than 149 genera and 68 families of fungi (Martins et al. 2016 ) in a Mediterranean ecosystem (Portugal), but Abdelfattah et al. (2015) reported only 13 endophytic fungal taxa in the leaves and twigs of olive trees. There has been a discrepancy to understand the phyllosphere fungi as endophytic or epiphytic, occasionally it is uncertain, for the reason that some can reside both epiphytic and endophytic modes of association. In general, phyllosphere endophytic fungi are the epiphytic habitats and are penetrated into the plant tissues to form an endophytic association (Kharwar et al. 2010; Porras-Alfaro and Bayman 2011) . Though they are phyllospheric, the soil has acted as a reserve for these potential endophytic inoculums of the above-ground organs (Zarraonaindia et al. 2015) . For example, Ascochyta sp. and Fagus crenata B1 (Osono 2006) , Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Phomopsis sp. (Rivera-Vargas et al. 2006; Twizeyimana et al. 2013) , and Table 5 .1 listed some examples of phyllosphere fungal endophytes. Osono (2008) reported that endophytic Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum, and epiphytes Pestalotiopsis sp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Phoma sp., and Ramichloridium sp. are the phyllosphere fungi in the plant Camellia japonica. However, the abundance and diversity of the fungi differ in plant species as well as in different eco-climatic conditions. Moreover, seasonal and leaf age-dependent variations also occur in the epiphytic and endophytic phyllosphere fungal assembly, for example, Geniculosporium sp. is varied in leaf age, and Cladosporium cladosporioides has been varied in both season and leaf age of the plant Camellia japonica (Osona 2008). Phyllosphere fungi play an important function in mineral absorption and mineral recycling process, specifically carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus recycling in the forest ecosystem.

The epidermal grooves are rich in nutrients specifically sugar and water. This region is less waxy cuticle, usually the leaf surface is fully coved with waxy cuticle which prevents the permeability and wettability of the leaf surface and regulates the colonization of the microbes on phyllosphere (Lindow and Brandl 2003; Burch et al. 2014 ). The leaf surface water droplets diffuse the waxy cuticle and improve the permeability by which the compounds are diffused from the apoplast to phyllosphere surface (Schreiber 2005) . These leached compounds and water on the phyllosphere are making the availability of nutrients to the microorganisms. Most commonly, the flow of water from the stomata (transpiration) is increasing the permeability and wettability of guard cells and its surface cuticles (Sch\u00f6nherr 2006) . Hence, higher permeation of the cuticle layer permits the microbes to colonize densely (Krimm et al. 2005) . Moreover, the surface bacteria are able to produce certain compounds like biosurfactants (syringafactin produced by Pseudomonas syringae) (Krimm et al. 2005; Burch et al. 2014 ) which can modify the cuticle surfaces of the leaf and establish its association. This can facilitate water availability and alter sugar availability that can improve living conditions for epiphytic bacterial growth (Lindow and Brandl 2003 ; Van der Wal and Leveau 2011). Epiphytes such as Pseudomonas sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., and Achromobacter increase the water permeability of the lipophilic cuticle present in Hedera and Prunus, which increases the availability of the compounds at the phyllosphere which will improve the epiphytic fitness on the leaf surface .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 220, "text": "(Staley et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}, {"start": 221, "end": 243, "text": "Shiraishi et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 368, "end": 391, "text": "(Lindow and Brandl 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 410, "end": 430, "text": "(Morris et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 431, "end": 453, "text": "Hirano and Upper 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 753, "end": 777, "text": "(Lindow and Brandl 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 778, "end": 795, "text": "Burch et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 963, "end": 979, "text": "(Schreiber 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1269, "text": "(Sch\u00f6nherr 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1378, "text": "(Krimm et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1538, "text": "(Krimm et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1556, "text": "Burch et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1774, "end": 1797, "text": "(Lindow and Brandl 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanism of Microbial Interaction with the Phyllosphere"}, {"text": "It has been experimentally proved in the bean phyllosphere containing fructose facilitates the growth of Erwinia herbicola and Pantoea agglomerans (Remus-Emsermann et al. 2013; Tecon and Leveau 2016) .

These studies suggested that the permeated carbon sources on the leaf surface are merrily exploited by the epiphytic microorganisms for their growth and multiplication. At the same time, the phyllosphere microbial population can influence the modulation of the physicochemical properties of the leaf with the help of both biotic and abiotic surroundings (Bringel and Cou\u00e9e 2015; Ohshiro et al. 2016; Quan and Liang 2017) .

Some competitive microbes produce certain toxic chemical substances (antibiotics and siderophores) as secondary metabolites which pose a negative effect on its competitor microbes.

Metaproteomic studies on the leaf surface communities have been identified as microbes producing vitamins and siderophores which give adaptation to the microbes at the environment. For example, phyllosphere of soybean, clover, and Arabidopsis plants largely colonized by Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium provides vitamins and siderophores to the plant (Green 2006; Delmotte et al. 2009 ) and it competes for other microbes. Methylobacterium spp. are involved in the assimilation of methanol at the phyllosphere, a by-product of demethylated pectin during the cell wall metabolism of the plant (Galbally and Kirstine 2002; Delmotte et al. 2009 ), and it gives epiphytic fitness to the microbes.

A bacteria colonizing at both habitats may differentially express their genes, for example, P. syringae pv. syringae B728a at epiphytic growth express the genes involved in motility, chemosensing, phosphate mobilization, and utilization of tryptophan which is higher than in endophytic growth (Yu et al. 2013 ). However, the secondary metabolite (syringomycin, syringopeptin) production was higher in the endophytic stage.

Plants contain two layers of defense, the primary immunity is named pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), it has a conserved molecule named microbe/pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs). The PTI is a localized immunity mediated at the plasma membrane containing pattern recognition receptors (Monaghan and Zipfel 2012; Wang et al. 2019) . The MAMP/PAMP limits the growth of bacterial pathogens. For example, the flagellin-sensitive receptor 2 (FLS2) is a pattern receptor which recognizes the P. syringae pathovar (pv.) bacterial flagellin (flg22) (Chinchilla et al. 2006; Newman et al. 2013; Trd\u00e1 et al. 2015) . However, the plant response to limits its defense against non-pathogenic bacteria is still unknown. The effector's protein-mediated destabilization of plant immunity and immune escape is also reported (Jones and Dangl 2006; Cui et al. 2009 ). Plant immunity is targeted with specific proteins, which involves the selfprotection against the microbial association has been deactivated by the interaction of microbial effector proteins and it makes protein-protein networks (Bogdanove 2002; Snelders et al. 2018) . Besides, plants have evolved with intracellular receptor molecules called nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), which either openly or ultimately recognize effector proteins to give the second layer of plant immunity named effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (Jacob et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2014 ). Both PTI and ETI generate more specific and diverse immunity against phyllosphere microflora. Beneficial or the synergistic microbes interact with signaling pathways (MAMPs) of the plant to elevate the production of its immune response. However, if pathogen could interact by using MAMPs, the immune output will be higher and will restrict the colonial establishment of pathogens. Pathogens that live in host tissues use hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs mode of life (Table 5 .3). Some chemicals of the plant tissues inhibit the microbial association either biotrophs (salicylic acid) or necrotrophs (jasmonic acid) type and also the reactive O 2 species may have an inhibitory effect on the pathogens (Lehmann et al. 2015) . Plants use jasmonic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethylene, flavonoid, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, and salicylic acid-mediated signals for quenching pathogens on its surface (Table 5 .4). Recently, pathogens with biotrophy-necrotrophy switch have been identified in fungi such as Colletotrichum sp, Phytophthora capsici, Moniliophthora roreri, and Macrophomina phaseolina in which pathogen evokes a differential response of growth in host tissues (Chowdhury et al. 2015) . Some important research in the mode of immune evoke by the pathogen has been listed in Tables 5.3 and 5.4. Phyllosphere region is usually colonized by a variety of microorganisms. Naturally, leaf epidermises are always contacted to external and internal environments and are enriched with a diverse group of bacteria, yeast, fungi, and viruses. The cuticle layer of the leaf surface plays a significant role during the contact with leaf Note \"Hemibiotrophs\" -an organism that is parasitic in living tissue for some time and then continues to live in dead tissue. \"Necrotrophs\" -can kill the host cells and feed on the contents microbiota (Vacher et al. 2016) . Though some group of microorganism may not multiply after it reaches on the surface, many continue to survive and multiply, until they can attain maximum number (Sch\u00f6nherr 2006; Innerebner et al. 2011; Pusey et al. 2011) . To multiply, microorganisms require carbon, nitrogen, inorganic, and organic energy sources. However, in the absence of such nutrients, phyllosphere is still usually colonized by a large number of bacteria (105-107 CFU/g of the leaf) in the presence of high relative humidity and free water at suitable environmental conditions (Sch\u00f6nherr 2006; Baldwin et al. 2017 ). This is due to the release of nutrients or leaf exudates which adequately supported the microbial growth. There are varieties of molecules leached from the plant leaves such as sugar, amino acids, organic acids, minerals, etc. (Beattie 2011; Remus-Emsermann et al. 2011; Meiners et al. 2017 ). These leaching materials may differ with plant species and the environmental condition (Beattie 2011; Remus-Emsermann et al. 2011; Mendes et al. 2013 ). Nutrients such as sugar photosynthates from the leaf interior may be diffused through the cuticle reached the outer surface (Schreiber 2005) , and are chiefly used by phyllosphere bacteria. Moreover, water droplets on a leaf surface facilitate the outward diffusion of these sugars ( Van der Wal et al. 2013 ). Both non-pathogenic and pathogenic microorganisms establish colonization on the leaf surface. To survive and thrive, epiphytic microbes have several adaptive properties such as the production of antibiotics, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), biosurfactant for increasing cuticle permeability, and availability of nutrients volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the leaf surface. However, in order to avoid the entry of pathogens, plants develop defense reactions. The preliminary defense is activated by recognition of the chemical compounds released during the contact with microbes (Boller and Felix 2009 ). Pathogen-induced molecular patterns (PAMPs)-triggered immunity (PTI) is a broad spectrum of defenses against the pathogen invades. However, effectors produced by the pathogens often interfere with PTI activation and are recognized by specific proteins, which stimulate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) that induces a hypersensitive response (Craig et al. 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 96, "end": 116, "text": "(Jacoby et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 422, "end": 448, "text": "(Monaghan and Zipfel 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}, {"start": 449, "end": 466, "text": "Wang et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 678, "end": 702, "text": "(Chinchilla et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 703, "end": 722, "text": "Newman et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 723, "end": 740, "text": "Trd\u00e1 et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF307"}, {"start": 967, "end": 982, "text": "Cui et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1230, "text": "(Bogdanove 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1252, "text": "Snelders et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF286"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1549, "text": "(Jacob et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1564, "text": "Wu et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF343"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2288, "text": "(Lehmann et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 2730, "end": 2753, "text": "(Chowdhury et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3394, "end": 3414, "text": "(Vacher et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF314"}, {"start": 3578, "end": 3594, "text": "(Sch\u00f6nherr 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 3595, "end": 3618, "text": "Innerebner et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 3619, "end": 3637, "text": "Pusey et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 3968, "end": 3984, "text": "(Sch\u00f6nherr 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 3985, "end": 4004, "text": "Baldwin et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4235, "end": 4249, "text": "(Beattie 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4250, "end": 4278, "text": "Remus-Emsermann et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 4279, "end": 4298, "text": "Meiners et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 4389, "end": 4403, "text": "(Beattie 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4404, "end": 4432, "text": "Remus-Emsermann et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 4433, "end": 4451, "text": "Mendes et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 4579, "end": 4595, "text": "(Schreiber 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 4739, "end": 4762, "text": "Van der Wal et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 5357, "end": 5379, "text": "(Boller and Felix 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 5725, "end": 5743, "text": "(Craig et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2032, "end": 2040, "text": "(Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2457, "end": 2465, "text": "(Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Plant Immunity/Responses to Control Microbial Colonization"}, {"text": "The diversity and community structure of phyllosphere microbes have been intensely studied by culture-independent methods.

This method comprises rRNA or ITS amplicon sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and transcriptional profiling (Delmotte et al. 2009; Rastogi et al. 2012) . Recently, Illumina platform has been performed better and allows ultra-high-throughput sequencing of microbial communities with high-quality reads (Degnan and Ochman 2012) . Proteogenomic is another method used for the microbial community structure analysis (Delmotte et al. 2009), a combination of genomics and proteomics to a great extent makes easy the structural and functional differences of microbiota in the phyllosphere environments. Through those methods, microbial diversity of several host plants such as Arabidopsis, Apple tree, Beech, grapevine, oak, poplar, Prunus, rice, soybean, spinach, tomato wheat, etc. was documented. The metadata of the metagenomic studies helps to understand the growth behavior, colonization ability, genus-level community structure formation (or) association, low and high index of diversity, and the host genotype effects on the self-defense as well as the cell wall integrity have been reported. Whole microbiome analysis by environmental sequencing is popular today to explain the plant's phyllosphere containing complex microbial communities. There are many methods for mapping the diversity of microbiome which could associate with any of the living and nonliving objects. Also, the environmental sequencing approach determines the whole microbiome of the plant and it illustrates the significant association of microbes on its host under controlled conditions. Recently, studies revealed that genome-wide association (GWA) is the best method which shows potential merits for identifying the microbial communities associated with different kinds of host-microbe interactions. The high-throughput environmental sequencing approach has guided to the discoverer to find the complex microbial ecosystem of leaves. Using this strategy, many studies revealed the microbial association in the phyllosphere of different plants such as mountain shrubs (Ruiz-P\u00e9rez et al. 2016), seagrass (Fahimipour et al. 2017) , subarctic grass (Uroz et al. 2016) , and equatorial forest canopies (Lambais et al. 2006) . The studies revealed that plant leaves are colonized by a huge and diverse group of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Rastogi et al. 2013; Morella et al. 2018; Sapp et al. 2018; Beilsmith et al. 2019 ). High-throughput molecular methods or culture-independent molecular techniques have interpreted the phyllosphere microbial community today (Table 5 .5). Through this technique, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria are common microbiome of plant leaves (Bulgarelli et al. 2013) , and it suggests that Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Bacillus, Massilia, Arthrobacter, and Pantoea are predominant genera consistently firm in the phyllosphere. Findings of the studies disclose the variation of microbial community structure mainly based on the genotypic nature of the plant species and also its geographical location. For example, Finkel et al.

Many of the microbes are the prime producers of plant growth hormones, specifically plant-associated or phyllosphere microbial communities produce IAA, gibberellic acids, and cytokines and could fix nitrogen and mobilize nutrients (Dourado et al. 2015) . There are many bacteria and fungi which produce IAA, similar to those of plants (Sun et al. 2014; Venkatachalam et al. 2016; Thapa et al. 2018 . Microbes use plant tryptophan to produce IAA, which can effectively improve plant growth and enhance overall health (Hayat et al. 2010; Yadav et al. 2015a, b) . The genus Methylobacterium is among the most commonly observed leaf epiphytes and represents an abundant and stable member of the phyllosphere microbial community of a wide range of crop plants such as sugarcane (S. officinarum L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.), mustard (Brassica campestris L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), and radish (Raphanus sativus L.) (Meena et al. 2012) , and has produced variety of growth-promoting phytohormones. The association of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), especially Methylobacterium sp., with plant hosts greatly benefits plant growth by production of phytohormones like auxins and cytokinins, and increased activity of enzymes such as urease and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD), which promotes growth and enhances the production of siderophores, thereby enhancing the uptake of essential nutrients. The benefits associated with plant-microbe interactions are also dependent on the variety of inoculation methods such as soil, foliar, and combination of both soil Videira et al. (2015) and foliar inoculations (Lee et al. 2011) . A study has been conducted to investigate the inoculation of Erwinia herbicola on plant growth by IAA production. The test results showed that about 65% of the E. herbicola strain recovered from the leaves showed higher expression of the ipdC gene than in culture. The study indicated that physical or chemical microclimates directly influence the differential expression of ipdC Endophytic Bacillus produces phytohormones such as abscisic acid, auxins, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, gibberellins, jasmonates, and strigolactones, and increases nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) accessibility to the host (Reinhold-Hurek and Hurek 2011; Brader et al. 2014; Santoyo et al. 2016; Shahzad et al. 2016; Ek-Ramos et al. 2019) .

Some endophytes provide additional functions to the host plant like drought tolerance, for example, endophytic B. subtilis strain B26 induces drought resistance to Brachypodium distachyon grass. The drought resistance mechanism is due to a specific carbohydrate metabolism, the endophytic bacteria increases stressresponsive raffinose-related family carbohydrates in the host (Gagn\u00e9-Bourque et al. 2015) . In another example, the endophytic association increases osmotic responses of the host plant. Endophytic strains such as Arthrobacter sp. and Bacillus spp. in pepper plant increase the proline accumulation, which gives osmotic tolerance (Sziderics et al. 2007 ). Further, endophytic bacterial inoculants provide abiotic stress tolerance mechanism to the host by its extracellular enzymes. For example, the endophytic association of various Bacillus spp. increases the superoxide dismutase, phenylalanine lyase, catalase, and peroxidase enzymes activity in gladiolus plants under sodium high concentration conditions (Damodaran et al. 2014) . Little studies reported that isolation of endophytic bacteria and their enzyme production potential vary when it colonizes in the plant tissues. Moreover, Jalgaonwala et al.
