Data relative to the occurrence of BRD in Brazil are scarce and incipient. Most of these investigations used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and identified infectious agents of BRD such as Histophilus somni (Headley, Alfieri, Oliveira, Beuttemmuller, & Alfieri, 2014; Headley et al., 2018), bovine alphaherpesvirus type 1, BoHV\u20101 (Suarez Heinlein et al., 1993), bovine respiratory syncytial virus, BRSV (Arns et al., 2003; Headley et al., 2017), bovine viral diarrhea virus, BVDV (Cortez et al., 2006; Flores, Ridpath, Weiblen, Vogel, & Gil, 2002; Otonel et al., 2014; Silveira et al., 2017), bovine coronavirus, BCoV (Headley et al., 2018), Pasteurella multocida (Baptista et al., 2017; Headley et al., 2018), Mannheimia haemolytica (Baptista et al., 2017; Headley et al., 2018) and Mycoplasma bovis (Tortorelli et al., 2017). Furthermore, studies done in Brazil using serology identified seropositivity to infectious disease agents including BoHV\u20101 (Barbosa, Brito, & Alfaia, 2005; Fernandes, Pimenta, Pituco, Brasil, & Azevedo, 2016), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, BPIV\u20103 (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2003), BRSV (Driemeier et al., 1997), and BVDV (Flores et al., 2005; Wageck Canal, Strasser, Hertig, Masuda, & Peterhans, 1998) and M. bovis (Pretto et al., 2001). Additionally, there is the isolation of M. bovis (Pretto et al., 2001), while few studies from Brazil have investigated only BRSV by immunohistochemistry, IHC (Brasil et al., 2013; Peixoto et al., 2000).",

Disease due to infectious agents associated with BRD is confirmed by the simultaneous presence of pathogens within the affected tissues (Fulton & Confer, 2012). The IHC assay is a sensitive diagnostic technique that can be used to identify the intralesional presence of specific protein of infectious disease agents associated with histopathologic lesions in formalin\u2010fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues sections (Fulton & Confer, 2012; Maes et al., 2013), and the results obtained are strong evidence of an associated disease process within the affected tissues (Fulton & Confer, 2012).",

However, only a few studies have used histopathologic diagnosis with related IHC assays to confirm the participation of infectious disease agents associated with BRD (Gershwin et al., 2015; Haines, Martin, Clark, Jim, & Janzen, 2001; Haines et al., 2004; Rodr\u00edguez, Bryson, Ball, & Forster, 1996).

The role of BVDV in the development of the mixed infections herein described, especially with respect to those of bovine pneumonic mycoplasmosis, must be highlighted. Several studies have suggested that synergism between BVDV and M. bovis (B\u00fcrgi, Josi, B\u00fcrki, Schweizer, & Pilo, 2018; Haines et al., 2001, 2004; Shahriar, Clark, Janzen, West, & Wobeser, 2002) and BVDV and BRSV (Liu, Lehmkuhl, & Kaeberle, 1999) may affect the severity of BRD due to the increased virulence of pathogens caused by synergy in coinfections (Ridpath, 2010). This aspect is relevant not only for the interpretation of experimental data, but because BVDV may interact with M. bovis in field conditions (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2018). Additionally, some strains of BVDV are immunosuppressive in cattle, due to the loss of alveolar macrophage functionality (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2018; Welsh, Adair, & Foster, 1995) and severe and extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes (Chase, 2013). Consequently, immunosuppression due to BVDV associated with BoHV\u20101, BRSV and M. bovis may have resulted in an increased severity of disease in this dairy herd, due to incapacity of the innate immune system to control these infections.",

Similar positive immunoreactivity to BVDV was described in 60% (6/10) of persistently infected (PI) calves, where it was proposed that the presence of BVDV antigen in respiratory cartilage is an indication that this viral disease pathogen predisposes cows to secondary bacterial infection (Confer, Fulton, Step, Johnson, & Ridpath, 2005). In the cases herein described, we were unable to confirm these cows as being PI animals since two biological samples were not available for testing. However, there was positive immunoreactivity to BVDV (using Mab 15c5) within the chondrocytes of the hyaline cartilage of the bronchus of the fetus of one of these cows. Collectively, these findings may suggest that the fetus of the gravid cow and probably the cow itself were PI animals; moreover, positive immunoreactivity to BVDV within the pulmonary cartilage of these two cows can correlate with the occurrence of simultaneous infections in these animals (Confer et al., 2005). Additionally, it must be highlighted that the MAb used during this study to identify intralesional antigens of BVDV has elevated specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of this infectious disease pathogen (Haines, Clark, & Dubovi, 1992).",

Until the present moment, the authors are unaware of studies done in Brazil that confirmed BRD due to infections by M. bovis using pulmonary tissues derived from adult dairy cattle with fatal pulmonary disease. Two studies have previously identified the presence of M. bovis associated with BRD in Brazil. The first identified M. bovis\u2010associated pulmonary disease in 26.1% (12/46) of calves due to a combination of bacterial culture and direct immunofluorescence using lung sections (Pretto et al., 2001). While the other amplified nucleic acids of M. bovis from 5.6% (1/18) of nasal swabs from dairy cows (Tortorelli et al., 2017). The marked difference between these and the current study was the confirmation of disease (Fulton & Confer, 2012), in our investigation due to the intralesional detection of antigens of M. bovis by IHC and intralesional accumulations of bacteria by the Giemsa stain, while the frequency of disease was more elevated. Additionally, during this investigation IHC assays were done from pulmonary tissues with gross evidence of disease, which may have also contributed towards the elevated number of positive cases, considering the elevated sensitivity of this diagnostic technique to identify intralesional antigens of infectious disease pathogens (Fulton & Confer, 2012). Since positive Giemsa staining was observed in most pulmonary sections that contained intralesional antigens of M. bovis by IHC, we postulate that Giemsa staining may be an adequate but simple method to characterize infections associated with this pathogen.",

These findings were previously described (Caswell & Archambault, 2007; Gagea et al., 2006; Haines et al., 2004) and demonstrate the ability of M. bovis to invade the pulmonary parenchyma, as was observed in experimental (Gershwin et al., 2015; Hermeyer et al., 2012; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1996; Thomas, Howard, Stott, & Parsons, 1986) and spontaneous (Gagea et al., 2006) cases of pulmonary disease in cattle. Furthermore, M. bovis may induce cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis of the alveolar macrophage (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2018), and neutrophils, inhibit the production of nitric oxide in cows (Jimbo et al., 2017) and infects a wide range of epithelial and immune cells (B\u00fcrki, Frey, & Pilo, 2015).

These findings may suggest that M. bovis can act as a primary disease pathogen and produce BRD. However, the possibility of M. bovis being a primary disease agent is still controversial, since this agent may colonize and perpetuate pulmonary lesions that were initiated by other bacteria, such as M. haemolytica or others virus (Caswell, Bateman, Cai, & Castillo\u2010Alcala, 2010). Nevertheless, the immunosuppressive nature of BVDV\u2010associated infections cannot be overlooked as contributing towards the development of BRD in these cows, since in most cases of combined infections associated with M. bovis, intralesional antigens of BVDV were detected.",

            "text": "As far as the authors are aware, this manuscript may represent the first description of M. bovis\u2010related BRD in dairy cows. This pathogen was frequently associated with several disease syndromes in dairy calves (Mahmood et al., 2017) and feedlot cattle (Caswell & Archambault, 2007; Haines et al., 2001), including descriptions of M. bovis\u2010related pneumonia (Gagea et al., 2006; Mahmood et al., 2017), but we did not locate reports of M. bovis\u2010induced BRD in adult dairy cows on searching major databases. Furthermore, M. bovis was not identified in recent studies done by our group to identify this pathogen associated with BRD in feedlot cattle from different geographical regions of Brazil (Baptista et al., 2017; Headley et al., 2014, 2018). Additionally, there are only two reports (Pretto et al., 2001; Tortorelli et al., 2017) of M. bovis\u2010associated pulmonary disease in cattle from this country. Although the exact reasons for the low detection rate of M. bovis\u2010associated BRD in Brazil are unknown, we believe that the reduced identification of this agent may be related to the diagnostic strategy used and the type of cattle evaluated, that is beef against dairy. All previous cases of M. bovis\u2010associated BRD were diagnosed in dairy cows (Pretto et al., 2001; Tortorelli et al., 2017), while this bacterial pathogen was not identified in studies done with beef cattle (Headley et al., 2014, 2017, 2018). It must be highlighted that nasal swabs were tested by PCR in the beef cattle surveys done by our group which resulted in negative results; however, these negative results could have been associated with the sporadic elimination of M. bovis so that PCR testing would not be an efficient method to detect this pathogen (Nicholas, 2011). This sporadic shedding of M. bovis may also explain the low results (5.6%; 1/18) obtained in a study done by another group from Brazil that used the same molecular testing strategy in dairy cattle (Tortorelli et al., 2017), as compared with the elevated results (26.1%; 12/46) obtained by bacterial culture and immunofluorescence assay using pulmonary tissue with characteristic lesions (Pretto et al., 2001). Since pulmonary mycoplasmosis is a chronic disease (Caswell & Archambault, 2007), dairy cows that are maintained for longer durations at a herd would be more prone to develop this infection as compared with beef cattle which are younger on entering feedlots and are maintained on feed for approximately 120\u2013150 days. Moreover, the higher detection rate in dairy cattle as opposed to beef cattle may be because the dairy cows, herein described, could have probably demonstrated extra\u2010pulmonary manifestations of mycoplasmosis, such as mastitis and reproductive diseases, with concomitant pulmonary disease. Lastly, pulmonary mycoplasmosis of cattle may probably be underdiagnosed in Brazil, considering that isolation can be difficult in severe chronic cases (Nicholas & Ayling, 2003), the sporadic shedding of M. bovis (Nicholas, 2011) in affected cows, and the molecular testing frequently used to identify this pathogen in association with BRD. Consequently, this pathogen should be suspected in dairy cows with clinical manifestations of respiratory distress and be included in the differential diagnosis of infectious disease agents associated with BRD in adult dairy cattle from Brazil. Moreover, pulmonary tissue rather than nasal swabs may be more efficient to diagnose M. bovis in dairy cattle.",

We have not seen this lesion previously described in the development of pulmonary disease.

Although the pathogenesis of angiogenesis observed at the lamina propria of the bronchus with ulcerative or necrosis induced by BoHV\u20101 is not fully elucidated, these cytokines may be associated with the development of this lesion due to inflammatory reaction, and necrosis; in addition, IL\u20108 has angiogenic and repair qualities (Koch et al., 1992).

Both mechanisms may facilitate pulmonary damage resulting in subsequent pneumonia and the dissemination of the infectious pathogen (Agnes et al., 2013). Additionally, BRSV infects type I and type II pneumocytes (Bryson, McConnell, McAliskey, & McNulty, 1991), with consequent apoptosis to these cells (Viuff et al., 2002), and produces necrosis of alveoli and small airways (Bryson et al., 1991), due to alveolar neutrophilic exudation (Agnes et al., 2013), resulting in suppurative alveolitis/bronchiolitis and necrotizing bronchiolitis/bronchitis (Andrews & Kennedy, 1997; Brasil et al., 2013; Gershwin et al., 2015; Peixoto et al., 2000). Moreover, during this investigation, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes was observed in association only with positive immunoreactivity to BRSV; similar findings were previously associated with chronic epithelial injury in the proximal alveolar region (Barry, Miller, & Crapo, 1985) and identified in beef cattle with chronic pulmonary disease (Driemeier et al., 1997). The low number of cases with syncytial formation (4/11) in the present study may be due to the fact that the manifestations were chronic (Driemeier et al., 1997). These histopathologic findings were observed in cattle infected by BRSV during this investigation and may have contributed to the increased severity of pulmonary lesions observed in the dairy cows herein described.",

Necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia, obliterative bronchiolitis and peribronchial lymphocytic cuffings were the characteristic histopathologic features associated with mycoplasma pneumonia. Necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis were associated with BVDV, BoHV\u20101 and BRSV. Necrohemorrhagic bronchitis with bronchial angiogenesis was associated with infection by BoHV\u20101. M. bovis was commonly detected in the tissues of fatal pulmonary disease during this outbreak and may be a possible primary disease pathogen associated with the development of bovine respiratory disease. Moreover, the histopathologic features observed within the patterns of pulmonary disease may be an excellent diagnostic tool to identify some infectious disease agents of BRD in dairy cattle.",
