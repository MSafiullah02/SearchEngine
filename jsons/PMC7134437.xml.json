The infection has been reported from many parts of the world and it continues as a serious threat to canine population despite the presence of vaccine (Carmichael, 2005). Symptomatic treatment is resorted to in case of parvoviral disease in dogs to reduce mortality in the absence of efficacious antiviral therapies for very specific treatment. Therapeutic efficacy of a recombinant feline interferon (type omega) preparation has also been evaluated, and such treatment provided better therapeutic results (Martin et al., 2002, de Mari et al., 2003).",

It occurs when redox homeostasis within the cell is altered due to either an over production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or deficiency of counteracting antioxidant system. The pathogenesis of several viral diseases like Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), influenza and hepatitis in humans has been linked to oxidative stress (Semba and Tang, 1999), and significantly higher level of lipid peroxides, reduced vitamin-C, serum selenium have been reported in HIV positive patients (Allard et al., 1998). Oxidative stress was also reported to be involved in pathogenesis of several infections in dogs such as Babesia gibsoni, (Murase et al., 1996), Leishmaniasis (Bildik et al., 2004), and in concomitant infection with Babesis and Ehrlichia (Kumar et al., 2006). However, there seems to have no report on possible involvement of oxidative stress in gastroenteritis in dogs with or without canine parvoviral infection.",

Zinc and copper are the co-factors of many antioxidant enzymes, and are utilized for synthesis of antioxidant enzyme Cu\u2013Zn Superoxide dismutase which catalyses conversion of superoxide radicals to less oxidizing H2O2 (Halliwell, 1994). Previous studies have shown that humans infected with HIV have deficiencies of trace minerals like selenium, and vitamin D (Cirelli et al., 1991, Simba et al., 1993) and inclusion of antioxidant with antiviral agent have been reported to have beneficial effects (Palamara et al, 1996). It was therefore hypothesized that gastroenteritis with involvement of canine parvo-virus may influence oxidative indices and that these may be targets for supportive therapy.",

In the present study, the majority of the dogs (52 out of 56) were unvaccinated and such vaccination trends are not uncommon (Houston et al., 1996).

In the present investigation, dogs aged between one and 12 months were recruited for the study as the incidence of parvoviral gastroenteritis has been reported to be the highest in puppies between weaning and 6 month of age (Houston et al., 1996).",

Altered status of antioxidant enzymes was documented in viral diseases like dengue haemorrhagic fever (Gil et al., 2004) and viral influenza (Oda et al., 1989).

Significantly increased level of blood copper was observed in dogs suffering from gastroenteritis irrespective of presence of canine parvovirus. Increased level of copper in the blood of affected animals might be due to increased inflammatory response as copper is an integral part of protein ceruloplasmin and its level rises in acute phase response.
