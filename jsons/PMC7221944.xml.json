Plants like Morus spp., jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus), coffea, and others are more and more studied in this context. Their potential activity against viral infections have been previously described in several studies [1,2,3,4].",

Human coronaviruses and several picornaviruses are responsible for regular worldwide epidemic outbreaks, thus representing a growing global public health problem. For instance, picornavirus infections are the most common infections identified in patients of all ages, and during peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis [5,6]. Among these viruses, enteroviruses like poliovirus 1 (PV1), human echoviruses, and parechoviruses share common features\u2014they are small (20\u201330 nm), nonenveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses, causing mild respiratory diseases; however, HPeV type 1 and 3 (HPeV1 and 3) and echovirus 11 (Echo 11) can cause severe systemic diseases in young infants [7]. Structurally different, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are bigger (120\u2013160 nm), enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses responsible for a large portion of upper and mild respiratory tract infections, like the common cold, bronchitis, or pneumonia. They have been isolated worldwide. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with global geographical distributions of the documented cases [8]. They also can be severe and deadly for newborns, young infants, elderly, or immunosuppressed patients and can be associated with high rates of mortality. Indeed, no treatments, nor vaccines, are available against HCoVs, and the existing treatments are essentially symptomatic. Few new molecules show an interest in this context (i.e., glycyrrhizin and nelfivanir) [9,10,11].",

Consequently, the different parts of the plant have been studied for potential biological activities [14,15,18,19]. Several chemical families have been isolated in Morus species, like flavonoids, benzofurans, stilbene, polyhydroxylated alkaloids, and kuwanons, showing a large variety of pharmacological activities. For example, flavonoids and oxyresveratrol showed anti-inflammatory activities, while mulberrofuran showed antibacterial activities against pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus. The group of kuwanons (isoprenylated flavonoids) include various compounds like kuwanon C, E, G, H, J, and S, which exhibit distinct biological activities. Indeed, kuwanon G showed antibacterial activities against Streptococcus mutans and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at 12 \u00b5g/mL (minimal inhibition concentration) [20]. Kuwanon C has shown an antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [16].",

Indeed, mulberry juice reduces the cytopathogenic effect of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) and feline calicivirus FCV-F9 [15]. Arylbenzofurans extracted from Morus cortex are described like replication inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [15]. Scientific literature also describes kuwanons (among others chemical structures found in Morus spp.) as potentially antiviral. Indeed, the authors of [16] reported kuwanon H as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibitor, leachianone as a human simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV 1 and 2) inhibitor, and three flavonoids as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenoviruses inhibitors [1,4]. Other kuwanons, like kuwanon G, a prenylated flavon, have been studied for several biological properties, like anti-inflammation activity, anti-oxidant, and antibacterial activities [21]. Though the bioactivity of kuwanon G is evident, no antiviral activity has yet been described for this compound.",

To the best of our knowledge, the list of the identified compounds is consistent with the one reported in the literature in the three cultivars analyzed. Our HRMS analysis revealed the presence of different polyphenolic compounds in the extracts, with coumarins, tannins, triterpenes, and flavonoids being the major ones.

On the day of infection, dilutions of kuwanon G (Biosynth\u00ae carbosynth, CAS No 75629-19-5) from 0.1 to 10 \u00b5g/mL were prepared in the culture medium, containing 2% of FBS. These concentrations have been chosen according to the kuwanon G cytotoxicity assay. Cascade dilutions of the HCoV 229E virus were prepared for each kuwanon G dilution in order to test the virus at a multiplicity of infections (MOIs) equal at 1, 0.1, and 0.01, and wells were incubated with the virus/kuwanon G mix. Each test was reproduced in 8 identical wells. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 33 \u00b0C. The analysis of the wells was performed by microscopic observation of the cytopathogenic effect of HCoV 229E in the presence and absence of kuwanon G and after staining of the cell monolayers with crystal violet, as previously described.",
