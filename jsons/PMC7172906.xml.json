            "text": "Due to similarities in genome organization and replication strategy, Arteriviridae are grouped in the order Nidovirales together with Coronaviridae, Roniviridae and Mesoniviridae. The biochemical properties of the structural proteins are, however, markedly different in Arteriviridae; yet, all Nidovirales share the property of possessing a nested genome, where the structural proteins are expressed from a set of 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs (Fang and Snijder, 2010, Gorbalenya et al., 2006). The open reading frames encoding the structural proteins are partially overlapping. Accordingly, one needs to keep in mind that a given amino acid context in a structural protein may actually be a by-product of evolutionary pressure on a different protein, encoded in part by the same RNA sequence. Also, this feature restricts the possibility to address virus protein mutations in recombinant viruses without affecting the overlapping ORFs.",

            "text": "Arteriviruses contain at least seven structural proteins (Fig. 1\n; Music and Gagnon, 2010). The nucleocapsid protein N builds the scaffold for the genomic RNA, and several membrane proteins are incorporated into the viral envelope: the glycoproteins Gp2, Gp3, Gp4 and Gp5 as well as the non-glycosylated membrane proteins M and E. Gp2/3/4 form a disulphide-linked heterotrimeric complex in virus particles, and Gp5 is disulphide-linked to M. N, M and Gp5 are major virion components, whereas E, Gp2, Gp3 and Gp4 are referred to as minor structural proteins (de Vries et al., 1992). A novel membrane-anchored protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame of the subgenomic mRNA encoding Gp5 was discovered recently. This ORF5a protein is incorporated into virus particles, but probably as a very minor component (Firth et al., 2011, Johnson et al., 2011). Yet, it is relevant for replication: PRRSV does not replicate in the absence of the ORF5a protein, whereas recombinant EAV lacking the ORF5a protein could be generated, but grew to low titres and displayed a tiny plaque size (Firth et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2013). Very recently, the non-structural protein nsp2 was shown to be incorporated into virions of a variety of PRRSV strains (Kappes et al., 2013). This protein is predicted to have several transmembrane-spanning regions and assists in the induction of double membrane vesicles, ER-derived membrane scaffolds forming the viral replication and transcription complex (Snijder et al., 2001). The role of nsp2 in virions is not yet understood.",

            "text": "From reverse genetics experiments with EAV and to some extent PRRSV, it is known that all structural proteins of either virus are essential for virus replication. If either Gp5 or M is deleted from the viral genome, no virus particles are released from infected cells. Thus, Gp5 and M are required for virus budding (which does not exclude additional functions, e.g. during virus entry). If expression of either Gp2 or Gp3 or Gp4 is abrogated, virus-like particles bud from cells, but the particles are not infectious, indicating that cell entry is disturbed in the absence of the minor glycoprotein complex (Wieringa et al., 2004, Wissink et al., 2005). Furthermore, the Gp2/3/4 complex governs cell tropism: When the ectodomains of EAV and PRRSV are swapped, the cell tropism of the resulting recombinant virus is altered, but not by exchanging the ectodomains of Gp5 and M (Dobbe et al., 2001, Lee and Yoo, 2006, Tian et al., 2012, Verheije et al., 2002). Interestingly, the Gp2/3/4 complex interacts either physically or functionally with E. Removal of E from the viral genome completely prevents incorporation of the Gp2/3/4 complex into virus particles, whereas in the absence of either Gp2, Gp3 or Gp4, the amount of E in virions is greatly reduced (Wieringa et al., 2004). Another peculiarity of the Gp2/3/4 complex is that Gp3 appears to be linked to the pre-formed Gp2/4 dimer only after virus budding (Wieringa et al., 2003b).",

The nucleocapsid \u2013 comprising the viral RNA wrapped by the N protein \u2013 is arranged as a double-layered, spherical hollow core, separated from the lipid envelope by a gap of 2\u20133 nm as revealed by cryo-electron tomography (Spilman et al., 2009). The arterivirus particles are produced intracellularly; no budding is observed at the plasma membrane (Costers et al., 2006, Mardassi et al., 1994, Wada et al., 1995). According to various electron microscopy studies, virus particle generation proceeds by budding of pre-formed nucleocapsids into the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or the Golgi apparatus (Pol et al., 1997, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Wada et al., 1995, Wood et al., 1970). In analogy to the distantly related coronaviruses (Klumperman et al., 1994, Stertz et al., 2007), the ERGIC \u2013 the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment \u2013 could be the budding compartment, which has, however, not been directly shown for arteriviruses.

Sialoadhesin is supposed to be required for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of virus particles and their vesicular transport to early endosomes (for review, see Van Breedam et al., 2010). In an elegant biochemical study, it was shown that upon incubation with virus particles, purified sialoadhesin binds to Gp5, but not to Gp3 and Gp4, which, however, are also sialylated. The difference in the specificity was attributed to differences in the type of linkage between sialic acid and the following sugar residue and to a multivalency effect (binding of sialoadhesin to the glycoprotein that is more abundant on the virion surface, i.e. Gp5) (Van Breedam et al., 2010). However, the essential role of sialoadhesin for virus entry is controversial, since cells and even transgenic pigs lacking sialoadhesin are efficiently infected and support virus replication (Prather et al., 2013). Thus, sialoadhesin may be a non-essential attachment factor for PRRSV to bind and concentrate virions on the macrophage surface, hence allowing a more efficient infection.",

CD163 appears to be the most specific receptor for PRRSV entry (for review, see Van Gorp et al., 2010, Welch and Calvert, 2010). The essential role of CD163 has been demonstrated most convincingly by rendering non-permissive cells susceptible to PRRSV infection upon transfection with CD163 (Calvert et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2010, Van Gorp et al., 2008). Interestingly, the host range specificity of PRRSV is not encoded in the cellular receptor, since CD163 and CD169 homologues from various mammalian species, including humans, can functionally replace the porcine receptors (Calvert et al., 2007, Van Breedam et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In pigs, PRRSV replicates in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and other cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, which disseminate the virus to the blood. Highly pathogenic PRRSV isolates may possess an expanded tropism to include epithelial cells (Frydas et al., 2013, Zhou and Yang, 2010). Clinical symptoms, appearing early after infection, are mainly respiratory illness in growing pigs, whereas in pregnant sows, infection often leads to reproductive failure (Rossow, 1998, Zimmerman et al., 1997). Viraemia is sustained for up to 4 weeks after infection. Beyond that phase, however, the virus is typically not cleared from the body, but persists due to continuous low levels of replication, predominantly in lymphoid tissues, and continues to be shed (Chand et al., 2012). The molecular cause of persistence, one main obstacle to eliminate PRRSV from pig farms, is unclear. It is generally assumed that the host's immune system is incapable of setting up a robust immune response against the virus, leading to this persistence phenomenon (Mateu and Diaz, 2008). There is a strong antibody response directed against N and Gp5 few days after infection, yet these antibodies do not neutralize the virus. Neutralizing antibodies, however, appear only late, after more than 4 weeks after infection (Yoon et al., 1994). Their appearance coincides with clearing of virus from blood. The importance of neutralizing antibodies is reflected by the findings that serum from convalescent pigs (Lopez et al., 2007) and passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies (Osorio et al., 2002) both provide protection to homologous challenge and clear virus from blood. However, it is not universally accepted that neutralizing antibodies are crucial for immunity. Viraemia is often resolved before neutralizing antibodies are detected (Murtaugh and Genzow, 2011).",

The exact signal peptide cleavage site in Gp5 of the reference strain VR-2332 was elucidated by mass spectrometry of recombinant and virus-derived protein. The results revealed that the signal peptide of Gp5 can be cleaved at two sites, between alanine 26 and valine 27 (site 1), or between alanine 31 and serine 32 (site 2). As a result, a mixture of Gp5 proteins exists in virus particles, some of which (cleaved at site 1) still contain the \u201cdecoy epitope\u201d sequence. The mass spectrometry data are not quantitative, but SDS-PAGE migration patterns suggest that the majority of Gp5 molecules in transfected cells is cleaved at site 2 (Thaa et al., 2013). In accordance, sequencing the N-terminus of Gp5 from purified PRSSV particles revealed that the first residue of mature Gp5 is serine 32 (i.e. signal peptide cleavage at site 2) (Robinson et al., 2013a). However, sequencing is less sensitive than mass spectrometry, and therefore less abundant N-termini of Gp5 would not have been detected by this method. In summary, the \u201cdecoy epitope\u201d-containing fraction of Gp5 in virions is probably small, but it needs to be tested whether it plays a role for immune evasion of the virus. The cellular fate of the cleaved signal peptides of Gp5 \u2013 most of which arise from cleavage at site 2 and thus contain the \u201cdecoy epitope\u201d sequence \u2013 has however not been determined. They might be processed to be presented on either MHC class I or class II to fool the immune system of the host, similar to what has been shown for signal peptides from other virus families (Hegde and Bernstein, 2006, Martoglio and Dobberstein, 1998).",

From digestion experiments with glycosidases it is known that (at least some) side chains are processed to an Endo-H resistant, complex form that contains terminal sialic acid (de Vries et al., 1995a, Delputte and Nauwynck, 2004). In addition, Gp5 (at least from EAV and LDV) contains repeating lactosamine units within the N-linked side chain, i.e. N-acetyl-glucosamine linked by a \u03b21\u20134 linkage to galactose (de Vries et al., 1992, Li et al., 1998), a rather unusual modification of a viral glycoprotein. Attachment of lactosamine units usually occurs in the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or the trans-Golgi network, their number is variable (causing Gp5 to run as a smear in SDS-PAGE) and probably cell type-dependent. The role of polylactosamine glycans for the biology of arteriviruses is unknown, but potentially important, since polylactosamine on (at least cellular) glycoproteins influences basal levels of lymphocyte and macrophage activation (Togayachi et al., 2007).",

The relevance of the glycosylation sites for replication of PRRSV strains in cell culture has been addressed in several studies. In the Lelystad strain, removal of the site N53 had no effect on virus replication, whereas exchange of N46 strongly reduced the release of virus particles, which also had a lower specific infectivity (Wissink et al., 2004). A very similar effect regarding the significance of individual conserved glycosylation sites was reported for the American strain FL-12. Mutations involving N44 did not allow the production of infectious virus particles, whereas viruses with removal of N51 in Gp5 grew to lower titres (Ansari et al., 2006). In contrast, a recent study with the type 2 strain JXM 100 demonstrated that removal of the conserved glycosylation sites did not affect virus replication in cell culture. Only if two sites were exchanged simultaneously was the virus yield reduced (Wei et al., 2012a). In EAV the single conserved glycosylation site in Gp5 is essential for virus replication; yet, the virus tolerates removal of a large fragment of Gp5's ectodomain (Snijder et al., 2003).",

This is surprising since overlapping sequons are generally not modified at both asparagines (Karamyshev et al., 2005). When Gp5 present in virus particles was analysed by mass spectrometry, microheterogeneity was observed regarding the use of the glycosylation sites in the hypervariable region, not all the potential sites were used in every molecule (Thaa et al., 2013). Regarding the functional role of the variable glycosylation sites, it was reported that the carbohydrate attached to position N34 was required for efficient virus replication of one type 2 strain (Ansari et al., 2006), but that the adjacent site N35 had no effect on virus replication of another type 2 strain (Wei et al., 2012a).

Improperly folded proteins may not associate with M and/or will not pass the quality control system of the ER and will thus be degraded and cannot contribute to formation of virus particles. This is particularly relevant for the conserved glycosylation sites.

Indeed, recombinant viral mutants with deleted glycosylation sites at N34, N51 and N34 + 51 exhibited enhanced sensitivity to neutralization by antibodies that had been raised against wild type PRRSV. In addition, these viruses also elicited a stronger neutralizing antibody response in infected piglets compared to wild type virus (Wei et al., 2012a). Likewise, a type 2 PRRSV field isolate lacking the conserved glycosylation site N51 in Gp5 (and also one glycosylation site in Gp3) raised a stronger antibody response than wild type (Vu et al., 2011). In another study, antibodies to the neutralization epitope were generated more rapidly when pigs were infected with a strain lacking the variable glycosylation sites. Conversely, there was no enhanced neutralization upon infection with a strain that lacks the glycosylation site N44, which is situated at the edge of the neutralization epitope (Faaberg et al., 2006).",

However, to reduce the amount of antibodies elicited in infected pigs, some of the earlier steps in the humoral immune response (i.e. the activation of B cells) must be hindered by glycosylation of Gp5. According to current text book knowledge, this is assumed to occur by binding of the B cell receptor (membrane-bound IgM) to Gp5 present in virus particles or on cellular debris, followed by endocytosis of the complex, proteolysis of Gp5 and subsequent presentation of Gp5-derived peptides by MHC class II molecules to T helper cells. Since generation of peptides occurs in lysosomes, which also contain glycosidases, MHC-presentation of antigen seems unlikely to be affected by glycosylation of Gp5. However, the initial step, recognition of Gp5 by IgM present on the surface of B cells, resembles an antibody\u2013antigen reaction and may thus be affected by glycan shielding.",

However, the isolation of a pseudorevertant containing a large deletion and only a single cysteine residue in Gp5 allowed for the identification of cysteine 34 as the binding partner of M. The deleterious effect of replacing the other cysteine residues (at positions 57, 63, 66, and 80) may be explained by prevention of essential intramolecular disulphide bridges between these residues (Snijder et al., 2003). It is also noteworthy that Gp5 of EAV tolerates a deletion of 19 amino acids including the single glycosylation site in its ectodomain; the resultant virus showed only reduced growth rates. A disulphide linkage between Gp5 and M is also essential for the infectivity of lactate dehydrogenase virus (Faaberg et al., 1995), but whether it exists in the respective glycoproteins of PRRSV has not been investigated so far.",

Western blotting after reducing SDS-PAGE revealed a single band for both Gp5-His and M-HA with the predicted molecular weight of \u223c27 kDa and \u223c20 kDa, respectively. After non-reducing SDS-PAGE an additional, hence disulphide-linked band of higher molecular weight (\u223c40 kDa) appeared (Fig. 4\nA). To confirm that residue 48, the only cysteine present in the ectodomain of Gp5 after cleavage of the signal peptide, forms the disulphide bond with the M protein, it was replaced by serine.

One might speculate that the long cytoplasmic tails of M and/or Gp5 bind to the MHC-like domain of N (complexed to the viral RNA), thereby recruiting the viral genome to the viral budding site. Such an interaction may be transient. The Gp5/M complex may not be sufficient for budding; it is conceivable that the nucleocapsid is required at least for initiation of budding. Such a mechanism would ensure that the viral genome is contained in the virion. In infected cells, the N protein has been observed to form protein tubules, intertwined with the replication complex membranes (Knoops et al., 2012, Wada et al., 1995); these tubules might extend towards the virus assembly/budding site. There may even be a connection between the membrane rearrangements that induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles (replication complexes) and virion assembly, involving for instance the N protein or nsp2, recently discovered to be contained in mature virions (Kappes et al., 2013).",

In principle, membrane bending can be achieved by variety of different, but not mutually exclusive mechanisms: by (1) a scaffolding mechanism, using either a rigid protein with intrinsic curvature (\u201cbanana-shaped\u201d) or a coat protein that polymerizes at the surface of or within the membrane, by (2) wedge-like insertion of an amphiphilic helix into one bilayer of the membrane in order to create membrane curvature, or (3) by a crowding mechanism exerted by a \u201cmushroom-shaped\u201d protein, for example a viral spike with a bulky ectodomain and a short cytoplasmic tail (Derganc et al., 2013, Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006). The latter mechanism seems unlikely to work for arteriviruses since the ectodomains of the viral glycoproteins are only small. Furthermore, arteriviruses do not possess a cytosolic matrix protein that polymerizes at the assembly site to induce bud formation, as has been described for several negative-strand RNA viruses (Garoff et al., 1998). However, the Gp5/M dimer might form higher-order oligomers, possibly induced by interactions between the membrane-embedded domains of both proteins. This is reminiscent of a mechanism proposed for the budding of caveolae (Bauer and Pelkmans, 2006) and the formation of the highly curved edges of ER tubules (Hu et al., 2011). The proteins involved (caveolin and reticulons/DP1, respectively) have two membrane segments with a hairpin-like topology, similar to what was considered above for parts of the hydrophobic region of Gp5 (see Fig. 3). The hairpin can be regarded as a wedge-like structure that displaces the lipids preferentially in one leaflet of the lipid bilayer, thus causing local curvature.",

Budding may also require cellular factors, such as the ESCRT complex (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport). In the cellular context, this reversibly assembled multisubunit particle is involved in sorting of proteins into vesicles that bud into the lumen of endosomes, thereby forming multivesicular bodies. Some viral proteins recruit parts of the ESCRT complex by so-called \u201clate domains\u201d (short peptide motifs such as PTAP or YPDL) and target them to the viral budding site to cause scission of assembled particles (for review, see Votteler and Sundquist, 2013). However, the ESCRT complex is not hijacked by every virus for efficient budding. Influenza virus, for instance, instead employs the viral protein M2 for virus particle scission. M2 is located at the edge of the viral budding site, and an amphiphilic helix inserts into the membrane to catalyze scission of virus particles (Rossman et al., 2010). For arteriviruses, it has not been investigated whether an amphiphilic helix in one of its proteins mediates scission of virus particles, whether budding depends on ESCRT or whether any other cellular factor is required for budding.",

The predicted molecular mass of the ORF5a protein is 5\u20136 kDa, but it migrates in SDS-PAGE at approximately 10 kDa. The protein is predicted to have a type III membrane topology, i.e. a central hydrophobic transmembrane region that may function as signal peptide, a short N-terminal ER-luminal ectodomain (5\u201312 aa) without any glycosylation sequon and a long (14\u201331 aa) C-terminal endodomain (Firth et al., 2011, Johnson et al., 2011) (see Fig. 5\n). The length of the endodomain could be extended to 63 amino acids by inactivation of putative stop-codons (Sun et al., 2013). There is very little amino acid conservation between ORF5a proteins from arteriviruses except for the sequence MF at the N-terminus and an arginine-/glutamine-rich sequence in the endodomain, penultimate to the predicted transmembrane region. Interestingly, the conserved RQ-motif of the ORF5a protein, which is weakly pronounced in EAV, is encoded by the same RNA sequence that encodes the hypervariable glycosylation-rich ectodomain region of Gp5 (Firth et al., 2011, Johnson et al., 2011). Thus, the genome of PRRSV has to maintain the (probably essential) RQ-motif in ORF5a while at the same time allowing flexibility in the hypervariable region of Gp5 (Robinson et al., 2013a).",

It is a small protein (8 kDa, 69\u201373 amino acids) composed of three domains (see Fig. 5): an N-terminal domain (\u223c25 amino acids) predicted not to be a signal peptide, a hydrophobic transmembrane region (\u223c20 amino acids), and a hydrophilic, polybasic C-terminal domain (\u223c25 amino acids) (Snijder et al., 1999). Fluorescence protease protection assays indicate that the hydrophobic domain spans the membrane once; the C-terminus of the E protein is oriented towards the lumen of the ER (and is hence present on the surface of virus particles), whereas the N-terminus is cytosolic (and hence inside virus particles) (Matczuk et al., 2013, Yu et al., 2010). Cross-linking experiments have shown that E forms homo-oligomers, which are not covalently linked by disulphide bonds (Lee and Yoo, 2006). In accordance, conserved cysteine residues present in the C-terminal (luminal) domain of E are not essential for viral replication, indicating that they play no structural role (Lee and Yoo, 2005). However, the exact stoichiometry of the homo-oligomers (i.e. whether E forms dimers, trimers, tetramers or higher-order oligomers) needs to be defined.",

However, amantadine is a very selective drug; it only inhibits the M2 proton channel of just some influenza A strains (Pinto and Lamb, 2006). Furthermore, the proton conductance of M2 depends on the presence of the strictly conserved sequence motif HXXXW, which is the only sequence element shared between M2 from influenza A virus and BM2 of influenza B virus (Pielak and Chou, 2011). However, this motif is not present in the transmembrane region of E from EAV or PRRSV.",

The effect of E on the membrane permeability of E. coli might be due to a general toxic effect exerted by overexpression of a hydrophobic protein. Furthermore, it is not known whether E integrates into the membrane of E. coli cells in a similar orientation and oligomerization status as in virus particles; this is rather unlikely considering the vast difference in membrane-targeting signals between bacteria and higher cells.",

Our attempts to pursue a similar approach for E, fused at its C-terminus to YFP, were unsuccessful as the protein could not be detected at the cell surface of transfected oocytes, which precluded any measurements (M.V. and Thomas Friedrich, Technical University Berlin, unpublished).

In that study the TMR of a glycolipid-anchored protein was replaced by the TMR of Gp4 and the resulting construct could be released from transfected cells by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), a characteristic hallmark for a GPI-anchored protein (Du et al., 2012).

In order to identify the signal peptide cleavage sites by mass spectrometry, we co-expressed the ectodomains of both proteins, C-terminally fused to either a HA-tag (Gp2-HA) or a Strep-tag (Gp4-strep) with a baculovirus expression system in insect cells. Gp2-HA was co-purified from the supernatant of infected insect cells with Gp4-strep using a Strep-tactin column (Fig. 7A). From this result, we conclude that both proteins were secreted as a disulphide-linked complex. Following digestion of glycans with PNGase F and SDS-PAGE, protein bands corresponding in size to deglycosylated Gp2 and Gp4 were excised from the gel and digested with either elastase or chymotrypsin. The resulting peptides were eluted from the gel slices and subjected to liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Processed Gp2 and Gp4 were identified with high confidence in all samples as these proteins were the first hits in the MASCOT search, where mass spectrometric fragments are matched with database entries to determine protein identity. No peptides corresponding in mass to the N-terminal (signal peptide) region were detected for both proteins. This implies that the signal peptide was completely cleaved from both Gp2 and Gp4. In the Gp4 samples, digested with elastase, various peptides starting with threonine 22 were identified (Fig. 7C). As this is not a cleavage site for elastase, the result indicates that Gp4 was cleaved after cysteine 21 by signal peptidase (LPCCWC\u2193TFYPCH). The most N-terminal peptides detected in chymotrypsin-digested Gp2 samples started with arginine 32, which is preceded by two tryptophan residues in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 7B). Since tryptophan is a chymotrypsin cleavage site, the two residues were most probably removed from the mature Gp4 protein during sample preparation. This suggests that signal peptide cleavage occurred after alanine 29 (GSLLPSAAA\u2193WWRGVHEVRV). Results from digestion of Gp2 with elastase and Gp4 with chymotrypsin (not shown) are consistent with the conclusion that Gp4 is cleaved after alanine 29 and Gp2 after cysteine 21. No evidence was found for alternative signal peptide cleavage sites such as L24 (GSLL\u2193PSAA\u2026), predicted in an older report (de Vries et al., 1995a). Thus, the signal peptide is cleaved from both Gp2 and Gp4 at a single site and, since the proteins are secreted from cells after removal of the C-terminal hydrophobic region, both Gp2 and Gp4 are typical type I transmembrane proteins, which corroborates earlier investigations (de Vries et al., 1992, Wieringa et al., 2002).",

Stepwise reduction of the amount of the glycosidase yielded a ladder-like band appearance that allowed counting of four bands. Since the lower band is completely deglycosylated, one can conclude that Gp4 contains three carbohydrates. Thus, one potential glycosylation site is not used in Gp4. This is most likely N65, which is part of the sequon NPT.

For Gp4 it was found that mutation of individual sequons does not affect virus replication, but double, triple or quadruple mutants of the glycosylation sites are lethal for virus production.

Gp2 contains three cysteine residues in its ectodomain, located at positions 48, 102 and 137. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE showed that Gp2 runs as several monomeric bands which are likely to be conformational variants (de Vries et al., 1995b). Mutation of individual residues revealed that cysteine 48 forms an intramolecular bond with cysteine 137, whereas cysteine 102 links Gp2 with Gp4. Incorporation of Gp2 into virus particles is reduced to 10\u201320% upon mutation of one of the cysteine residues. This suggests that transport of the Gp2/4 complex to the viral budding site is rendered inefficient or retarded by mutating the cysteines, probably due to a folding defect. The viruses that are produced are greatly impaired in replication (C48S, C137S) or are completely non-infectious (C102S). Thus, the disulphide linkage between Gp2 and Gp4 is essential for infectivity of EAV, whereas the intramolecular bond in Gp2 is required for efficient replication (Wieringa et al., 2003a).",

One of these cysteines must link Gp4 to cysteine 102 in Gp2; one or potentially two other cysteines form a disulphide bond with Gp3 in virus particles (see Section 2.4.3). In order to assess the relevance of each cysteine in Gp4 for virus replication, we exchanged them individually to serine in an infectious clone of the Bucyrus strain of EAV. Only in the case of the mutation C50S could infectious virus be rescued, indicating that C26 and C77 are essential for virus infectivity. The virus with the Gp4 mutation C50S produced only tiny plaques (Fig. 9\n) and grew to very low titres (5 \u00d7 102\n PFU/ml), which precluded further analysis by biochemical means. Thus, similarly to Gp2, the cysteines in Gp4 are either essential for infectivity (C26, C77) or required for efficient virus replication (C50). All of them are thus likely to play a crucial structural role in the Gp2/3/4 complex.",

In Gp4 of the PRRSV strain Lelystad, a linear epitope was identified using a panel of monoclonal antibodies generated in mice. This epitope comprises amino acids 59\u201367, which are located in a highly variable region of Gp4. In accordance, the monoclonal antibodies neutralize the infectivity of the Lelystad strain, but do not react with Gp4 from the American genotype strain VR-2332 (Meulenberg et al., 1997). A later study revealed that na\u00efve pigs produce antibodies against this epitope 2\u20133 weeks after experimental infection, even if virus strains with large amino acid differences in this region are used for infection. These antibodies reduce replication of homologous, but not heterologous virus strains in PAMs (Vanhee et al., 2010). Finally, antibody-escape mutants isolated from pigs contained single amino acid substitutions in this epitope and acquired resistance against neutralization by a Gp4-specific monoclonal antibody. However, other antibody-escape mutant variants did not contain amino acid substitutions in the epitope of Gp4, which implies that further neutralizing epitopes might exist in membrane proteins of PRRSV (Costers et al., 2010). Since the neutralizing epitope of Gp4 is highly variable, this part of the molecule is unlikely to be crucial for its function during cell entry. One can speculate that it forms a loop on the surface of the viral spike, similar to the antibody binding sites in influenza virus haemagglutinin (Wiley et al., 1981).",

This is a unique observation in glycobiology, since only one asparagine per molecule is usually used in overlapping sequons (Karamyshev et al., 2005). The signal peptide is retained in the mature protein. However, the signal peptide of Gp3 is cleaved upon deletion of both (but not one) glycosylation sites of the overlapping sequon or when glycosylation is inhibited pharmacologically. This indicates that co-translational attachment of carbohydrates prevents access of the signal peptidase to the cleavage site of Gp3 (Matczuk et al., 2013).

Variation in the C-terminus might affect the mode of membrane attachment of Gp3. It is conceivable that PRRSV-Gp3 is only weakly membrane-anchored in some strains. These differences might explain why incorporation of Gp3 into virus particles has been questioned and why a significant fraction of Gp3 molecules is secreted from transfected cells (Mardassi et al., 1998). It is tempting to speculate that a secreted Gp3 protein acts as a \u201cdecoy\u201d that \u201cdistracts\u201d antibodies from virus particles. Indeed, antibodies against various regions of the Gp3 protein were elicited in the majority of experimentally infected piglets, and most of them had no or only little neutralizing activity (de Lima et al., 2006, Oleksiewicz et al., 2001, Oleksiewicz et al., 2002, Vanhee et al., 2011).",

Since the N-terminal signal peptide is retained in the mature protein, we asked whether Gp3 is myristoylated. We expressed Gp3 (fused at its C-terminus to YFP) in CHO cells and labelled the protein with [35S]-methionine and with [3H]-myristate, respectively, followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Whereas the E-protein of EAV, expressed and labelled in parallel, was clearly [3H]-myristoylated, no myristoylated band with the size of Gp3 was detected (Fig. 11\n). Gp3 was even not myristoylated when arginine at position 3 was changed to alanine, a mutation that greatly increases the confidence level with which myristoylation of Gp3 is predicted by a bioinformatics tool (http://web.expasy.org/myristoylator/). Thus, the N-terminus of Gp3 is probably shielded from the cytosolic N-myristoyltransferase by binding to the signal recognition particle (SRP), which associates with the signal peptide as soon as it emerges from the ribosome. In the case where myristoylation of an N-terminal signal peptide for a viral glycoprotein was reported (glycoprotein C of arena virus; Schrempf et al., 2007), the signal peptide is much longer (58 amino acids), giving the N-myristoyltransferase more time for interaction until the site for recognition by SRP emerges from the ribosome.",

Disulphide bond formation between Gp3 and Gp2/4 is assumed to be a spontaneous process, accelerated by physiological temperature, oxidizing conditions and slightly basic pH (Wieringa et al., 2003b). Since two cysteine residues must be in very close vicinity to form a covalent bond, Gp3 is likely to be non-covalently associated with the Gp2/4 dimer already in budding virus particles (Wieringa et al., 2003b). Accordingly, the minor glycoproteins can associate with each other independently of glycosylation and disulphide bonds, as demonstrated by refolding experiments with the ectodomains of these proteins purified from E. coli (Kabatek and Veit, 2012).",

First, intramolecular disulphide bonds are formed in Gp2 (and probably also in Gp4), which are rearranged until a properly folded product is achieved. This is followed by association of both proteins and stabilization of the resulting dimer by an intermolecular disulphide bond (Wieringa et al., 2003a). Since Gp3 is capable to associate with Gp2/4 in virus particles and also with Gp2 and Gp4 in vitro (Kabatek and Veit, 2012), the question arises what prevents formation of the Gp2/3/4 trimer already in the ER and what triggers its build-up later on. One might speculate that a conformational rearrangement occurs in Gp2/4 and Gp3 after transport from the ER to the Golgi, which might be triggered by the different milieu present in the Golgi lumen. This may now result in closer interaction of Gp3 with Gp2/4 to bring the relevant cysteine(s) into close proximity. Since the lumen of the Golgi lacks PDI and is slightly acidic (Paroutis et al., 2004), disulphide bond formation does not occur here, but only after release of virus particles.",

Also, E might conduct protons (or other ions) to adjust the milieu of the lumen of ER or Golgi, which may regulate interactions between Gp2/4 and Gp3. A similar intracellular function has been reported for the proton channel M2 of influenza virus, which neutralizes the pH of the Golgi lumen to prevent an unwanted proton-driven conformational change of the viral spike haemagglutinin (Ohuchi et al., 1994).",

When Gp2, Gp3 and Gp4 of EAV are expressed together, all proteins remain Endo-H sensitive, indicating that they are not transported to and beyond the medial-Golgi (Wieringa et al., 2003b). However, it has not been analysed whether oligomerization of the minor glycoproteins occurs under these conditions and whether a certain oligomer (e.g. the Gp2/4 dimer) is transported to the cis-Golgi and can thus pass the quality control system of the ER (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003). For Gp2/3/4 of PRRSV it has been reported that only co-expression of the three proteins with E allows processing of the proteins into an Endo-H resistant form and partial transport to the plasma membrane. Whether E is actually required for transport of Gp2/3/4 was not determined since Gp2 and E are encoded by overlapping genes and were simultaneously expressed from the same vector in that study (Wissink et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the results suggest that oligomer formation is the critical step for exit of Gp2/3/4 from the ER and further transport. It is totally unclear whether there is a motif in any of the minor glycoproteins that is relevant for subcellular targeting. Note that none of the known retention signals is present in any of the minor glycoproteins. A potential exception could be the transmembrane domain of Gp4, which is rather short, and the cytosolic C-terminus of EAV-Gp2 of EAV that ends with the sequence RRRKIL, reminiscent of the canonical ER retention signal KKXX. However, PRRSV-Gp2 does not contain an identical or similar sequence, and this region is not even conserved between PRRSV strains.",

This is in accordance with results on cellular model proteins that also demonstrated that the signal peptide needs to be cleaved before a sequon four residues downstream of the cleavage site can be glycosylated efficiently (Chen et al., 2001). It was concluded that signal peptidase and OST act in a sequential and dependent manner with their substrate, i.e. signal peptide cleavage occurs first (Chen et al., 2001). In contrast, attachment of glycans to sequons two residues downstream of the predicted signal peptide cleavage site prevents cleavage in EAV-Gp3 (Matczuk et al., 2013).

One can imagine that a signal peptide recruits either OST or signal peptidase to the translocon to allow privileged access to sites that emerge from the translocon. This in turn might influence whether a cysteine is able to form a disulphide bond and whether co-translational formation of a disulphide bond affects glycosylation or the site of signal peptide cleavage. Thus, mutations in the N-terminal region of Gp3 or Gp5 (and even in the signal peptide) might affect all co-translational modifications in an unpredictable manner.

Furthermore, mutations in the N-terminal region of Gp3 occurring during virus propagation in animals might have a similar effect. We have shown that EAV containing Gp3 with cleaved signal peptide is as infectious as wild type EAV, at least in cell culture (Matczuk and Veit, 2014). EAV isolated from the semen of a persistently infected stallion has lost the glycosylation site in the N-terminal region of Gp3, which is otherwise highly conserved (Balasuriya et al., 1999). Whether or not the co-translational modifications are accomplished has a strong impact on a protein's structure, its interaction with other viral proteins and hence the antigenicity of a viral spike.

Interestingly, the changes in Gp3 (including a five-amino-acid extension at its C-terminus) were observed only in a vaccine strain with a restricted tropism for CD14+ monocytes, whereas a virus with blocked infectivity for CD3+ T-lymphocytes had no mutations in Gp3.

            "text": "It has not been determined for any arterivirus which of the viral spikes mediates fusion between the viral envelope and cellular membranes. One characteristic hallmark of viral fusion proteins is the presence of a fusion peptide, a hydrophobic region within the protein sequence that \u2013 after a conformational change of the fusion protein \u2013 inserts into the membrane of the target cell to initiate fusion (Earp et al., 2005, Kielian and Rey, 2006). A Kyte\u2013Doolittle plot reveals that Gp2, Gp3 and Gp4 (but not Gp5 and M) contain an additional region with similar hydrophobicity in the middle of each protein besides the N-terminal signal peptide and the hydrophobic C-terminus (Kabatek and Veit, 2012). These proteins thus resemble classical viral fusion proteins in this respect. Another characteristic feature of viral (and cellular) fusion proteins is the presence of so-called heptad repeats, amino acid sequences with a high propensity to form coiled coil domains. Such heptad repeats are not be predicted for any of the arteriviral membrane proteins (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/pcoils).",

To resolve this question experimentally, the Gp2/3/4 complex has to be purified in a native form and tested in established membrane fusion assays, such as haemolysis of erythrocytes (a feature of EAV particles; Veit et al., 2008) or fusion with fluorescently labelled liposomes. Also, it would be instructive to identify the target of cathepsin E (Misinzo et al., 2008), which might cleave the viral glycoprotein that subsequently executes membrane fusion, similar to what has been proposed for SARS and Ebola viruses (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012, Hunt et al., 2012). Other proteolytic steps that are typically needed for activation of viral membrane fusion activity, such as cleavage at mono- or polybasic sites (Klenk and Garten, 1994), have not been described for any glycoprotein of arteriviruses.",

Yet, research in the last years has increased our understanding of these viruses, also in terms of their molecular protein biochemistry, which we have reviewed here. Of particular note, this research has revealed peculiarities that appear to be unique in cell biology, for example the inhibition of signal peptide cleavage by adjacent carbohydrates in Gp3 and the late formation of disulphide bonds between Gp3 and Gp2/4 in virus particles. However, such research is not purely academic since it may contribute to a knowledge-based design of vaccines.
