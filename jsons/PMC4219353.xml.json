However, the mechanisms by which viruses induce exacerbations of chronic airways disease are not well understood. In response to viral infection, the airway epithelium, and to a lesser extent immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells 4, 5, 6, 7, release pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, interferons (IFNs), and antimicrobial substances, which in turn, promote clearance of microorganisms, and activation of the adaptive immune system. However, in patients with chronic respiratory illnesses, the innate immune response may also be responsible for disease exacerbation 8.",

To further examine the innate immune response to viral infection in children with asthma, we measured nasal aspirate cytokine levels in 16 asthmatic children before and after upper respiratory tract infections. In contrast to the previous studies, we examined at least three time points before and in association with symptomatic illness. We evaluated the associations between viral infection and cytokine expression, and between cytokine expression and symptom score. We also examined the effects of upper respiratory tract infection on mRNA levels of selected markers of viral infection, including IFNs. Finally, we evaluated a new method of virus detection using a single polymerase chain reaction\u2013ligation detection reaction (PCR\u2010LDR) multiplex assay. We hypothesized that respiratory viral infection of children with asthma causes robust elaboration of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and IFNs, and that the level of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines correlates with symptom severity.",

Outpatients were enrolled for 3\u20136 months, with the goal of assessing cytokines at baseline and in association with at least one viral\u2010induced exacerbation during that period. Initial consent and first evaluation was conducted at the University of Michigan, but all subsequent evaluations were performed in the participant's home.

Families were given a calendar and a simple respiratory symptom scale and asked to mark the level of their symptoms. We used a modified version of the respiratory symptom score developed by the Child Origins of Asthma Study 21, which assessed fever, cough, nasal symptoms, wheezing, difficulty breathing, waking up at night with cough, and interference with usual activities. When the patient experienced a symptomatic respiratory illness, as defined by a symptom score of two or higher on a scale of 0\u201313, the family notified the study staff and scheduled a visit within 48 h of the beginning of symptoms (defined as day 1 of the illness). Information regarding impact of respiratory symptoms on daily activities and recent use of asthma medicines was also collected. As noted above, study technicians visited the home every 2\u20133 days to retrieve additional nasal washing samples, for a total of three visits during the week following reporting of symptoms. The three specific days of the week selected for analysis were based on the convenience of the subjects and laboratory technician. Although specimens were most often collected on days 1, 4, and 7 of a given week, specimen collection was sometimes compressed into a 5 or 6\u2010day period.",

Ascher, Lenexa, KS, USA). The subject then blew their nose into a zippered plastic bag, and 3 ml of M4RT viral transport medium (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA) was added. In general, samples were collected in the presence of study staff and were transported from homes to the laboratory within 3 h of collection in a cooler with ice packs. However, due to logistical issues scheduling home visits, families were also provided with kits for independent collection of nasal washings specimens at home. If a visit could not be scheduled within 48 h, families were instructed to collect the sample, double bag the sample, place in a tightly sealed collection box, and to keep it in the refrigerator until the staff could collect the sample.

In theory, chemokine production by virus\u2010infected epithelial cells induces the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways, which in turn elaborate cytokines and mediators capable of increasing airway responses. Data suggest that immune cells may also be infected by respiratory viruses and produce chemokines 7, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. In the present study, we found that, during natural colds, respiratory tract cytokine levels significantly increase in children with asthma. Levels of a subset of cytokines correlated with the degree and time course of respiratory symptoms. The chemokines detected are responsible for recruitment of a broad array of inflammatory cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. Finally, we detected changes in nasal lavage specimens, which were collected at home on a repeated basis, both before and in association with infection. Although we did not measure cytokine levels in normal subjects, these data show that children with asthma are apparently capable of a robust cytokine response to viral infection, even during mild exacerbations. In addition, home collection of nasal lavage specimens appears to be a practical tool for studying the natural history of viral infection in children.",

Furthermore, CXCL8 levels correlated with the number of sputum neutrophils. Teran et al. asthma 16 found that, compared to asymptomatic periods, levels of major basic protein, CCL5 and CCL19 were increased in the nasal aspirates of 26 children during acute viral\u2010induced exacerbations. Grissell et al. asthma 17 found that compared to a group of stable asthmatics, levels of CCL5 and IL\u201010 were significantly elevated in the induced sputa of older children and adults suffering from acute viral\u2010induced asthma exacerbations, along with neutrophils and eosinophils. CXCL8 and CCL19 were also increased, although not significantly.

In the present study, in which patients were used as their own controls, we confirmed the above changes in CXCL8, CCL5, CCL19, and CCL7, and provide new data showing significant increases in CXCL10, CCL11, CCL2, and CCL4.

We found that viral infection during natural colds significantly increased the levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 protein and IFN\u2010\u03bb mRNA in the nasal aspirates. Viral infection also significantly increased the expression level of RIG\u2010I and IRF\u20107, each of which are inducible by type I IFNs 36, 37. Together, these data suggest that asthmatic children are capable of a functional IFN response. On the other hand, we failed to detect IFN\u2010\u03b1 or IFN\u2010\u03b2 protein in nasal aspirates, and there was no significant change in mRNA levels during natural colds. Detection of type I IFNs in respiratory secretions is made difficult by the low sensitivity of commercially available assays, physiologically low levels of these cytokines in biological fluids (particularly in fluids without sufficient numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and presence of natural inhibitors (e.g. soluble receptors). Also, we could not compare the results from our experimental subjects to children without asthma.",
