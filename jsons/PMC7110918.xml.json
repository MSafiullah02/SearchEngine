But our results may provide some insights into random walk problem on\ncomplex networks, in particular, on trees. More recently, the so-called border tree motifs\nhave been shown to be significantly present in real networks,36 looking from this angle, our work may also shed light on some\nreal-world systems. Finally, we believe that our analytical techniques could be helpful for\ncomputing APL of and transit time for random walks on other deterministic media. Moreover,\nsince exact solutions can serve for a guide to and a test of approximate solutions or\nnumerical simulations, we also believe that our vigorous closed-form solutions can prompt\nrelated studies of random networks.",
