Smokers, patients with uncontrolled diabetes, and immunocompromised patients appear more susceptible to acute complications, whereas patients reporting a history of repeated sinusitis episodes are at increased risk for the rare but distressing complication of chronic sinusitis. [4] [5] [6] In 2012, an expert panel provided a 19point list of recommendations for reducing incidence of infection-related complications after sinus augmentation surgery. 7 Antibiotic prophylaxis, preoperative skin disinfection, and use of sterile draping were among the recommendations. 7 One option for managing sinus graft infection is to selectively remove the infected portion of the graft, thoroughly irrigate the remaining graft, refrain from placing additional biomaterial, and monitor healing over an extended period. 2 Another approach involves complete bone graft removal and debridement of the sinus without placement of any additional biomaterial. 8 The present case suggests locally applied tetracycline hydrochloride ",

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed \u22481 mm bone thickness between the osseous crest and sinus floor (Fig. 2) . The Chief Resident (AL) discussed alternative therapies with the patient, who elected sinus augmentation for subsequent implant placement. A 9 \u00d7 12 mm ovoid window in the lateral wall exposed the Schneiderian membrane, which was gently elevated along the sinus floor and superiorly along the medial wall (Fig. 3) . The sinus membrane expanded and contracted with respirations, and no perforation was detected on visual inspection. Thorough irrigation of the surgical site and antrum did not present fluid from the nose, and exhaling while occluding the nose did not produce bubbles in the lateral window. A freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) \u2021 hydrated in normal saline was placed in the sinus, and the surgical access was covered with a bovine pericardium membrane \u00a7 (Fig. 4) . The surgical site was closed using nonresorbable sutures, and healing during the first week proceeded uneventfully. The patient received postoperative analgesics and a 1-week course of amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily). Day 19 post surgery, the patient described nasal congestion with circumscribed radiolucent area within the allograft, expansion of allograft particles beyond the margin of the lateral window, and loose biomaterial particles erupting into the maxillary sinus were noted. Most of the contaminated biomaterial appeared contained and accessible to an oral approach. In a more posterior CBCT slice, the ostium appeared free of obstruction. Mucociliary clearance was expected to eliminate escaped particles. Removal of the contaminated biomaterial particles as soon as possible was a treatment priority. sinus pressure and was prescribed saline nasal spray and a 14-day course of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily). Day 23 post surgery the patient presented with increased severity of previous symptoms in addition to headache, purulent nasal drainage, and a yellow pustule in the area of tooth #3 (Fig. 5) . CBCT evaluation suggested breach of the Schneiderian membrane (Fig. 6) . A diagnosis of ABRS secondary to sinus graft infection was made. 9 ",

The antrum was thoroughly flushed with 90 mL normal saline with no fluid flow from the nose. Membrane perforation was anticipated based on CBCT assessment but not detected intraoperatively despite careful inspection, possibly suggesting membrane repair in response to systemic doxycycline. The intact Schneiderian membrane was fixed in a superior position and did not expand or contract upon respirations. The medial wall of the maxillary sinus was readily visible using loupes and illumination. An amnion-chorion membrane \u00b6 was trimmed and placed in contact with the inferior aspect of the Schneiderian membrane to protect against a clinically undetectable perforation. FDBA was hydrated in an aqueous TTC solution (50 mg/mL) for 5 minutes, rinsed twice with normal saline, and placed into the sinus (Fig.  7) . A collagen membrane # was placed over the access lateral window. The site was closed and allowed to heal for 8.5 months.

Upon systemic or topical administration, TTC substantively binds mineralized tissue. 13 In vitro, dentin slabs immersed in a 50-mg/mL solution retained biologically active TTC concentrations over at least 48 hours. 13 With repeated oral dosing, TTC concentrations in maxillary sinus secretions approach serum concentrations, although saliva and tear concentrations remain low. 14 Locally applied TTC has been used in an attempt to enhance bone regeneration in ridge preservation/augmentation procedures as well as in the treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] TTC is effective against the bacterial species most frequently associated with ABRS. Indeed, systemic doxycycline is recognized as an alternative to amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line antibiotic in ABRS treatment. 9,12 ",
