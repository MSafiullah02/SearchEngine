            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading global causes of mortality and morbidity [Pingleton et al., 1992; Pena et al., 2000]. According to a recent study, the overall prevalence of COPD has been estimated as high as 10% of the world's population [Soriano et al., 2010]. Acute exacerbation of COPD (AE\u2010COPD) and concomitant pneumonia in COPD (CP\u2010COPD) are two serious conditions that often complicate COPD [Wedzicha and Seemungal, 2007; Mullerova et al., 2012]. Respiratory viruses are a well\u2010known cause of AE\u2010COPD, which are responsible for 39\u201356% of AE\u2010COPD [Seemungal et al., 2001; Rohde et al., 2003]. Recently, newly discovered respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1, and bocavirus have been added as important causes of AE\u2010COPD [Ringshausen et al., 2009; Kherad et al., 2010]. Also, with the development and application of technology to detect viral nucleic acid, the detection of respiratory viruses in AE\u2010COPD has markedly improved [Mohan et al., 2010].",

In our current study, of the 19 CP\u2010COPD patients with human coronavirus infection, 12 (63.2%) had bacterial co\u2010infection, including six with S. aureus and two with S. pneumoniae. A prior report showed that there was an increase in S. aureus acquisition during the SARS period [Yap et al., 2004]. Recently, a Polish group reported that human coronavirus NL63 increases the streptococcal adherence to respiratory epithelial cells [Golda et al., 2011], and that human coronavirus NL63 infection is associated with an increase in platelet\u2010activating factor receptor (PAF\u2010R) expression, which promotes adherence of S. pneumoniae. Our study supports the work by Golda et al. who saw the same events but in an in vitro assay. These finding suggests that human coronavirus infection might be associated with a risk of pneumonia development through bacterial co\u2010infection in COPD patients. Further studies will be needed to confirm this result.",

            "text": "Regarding the bacterial pathogens identified in our present investigation, S. aureus and A. baumannii were significantly more commonly identified in the CP\u2010COPD group than the AE\u2010COPD group. These bacteria are a well known cause of health\u2010care associated pneumonia (HCAP) or hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) [Yoo et al., 2013]. However, A. baumannii has not been listed as the cause of AE\u2010COPD and S. aureus is an uncommon cause of AE\u2010COPD (approximately 0\u20136%) [Domenech et al., 2013; Reissig et al., 2013]. Exposure to recent antibiotics during hospital stay might have influenced the type of pathogen, and more than 20% of CP\u2010COPD events were hospital\u2010acquired infections or health care associated pneumonia. The patients in the CP\u2010COPD with S. aureus group received antibiotics more frequently than those in the other pathogen group (62.5% [15/24] vs. 11.0% [9/82], P < 0.01). In addition, previous studies performed in Korea showed that S. aureus and A. baumannii are important pathogens, particularly in HCAP and HAP patients (with ranges of 6.1\u201319.8% and 2.0\u201316.0%, respectively) [Choi et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2014].",

We found that few investigators to date have compared the outcomes between AE\u2010COPD and CP\u2010COPD. Recently, a Spanish group compared the clinical outcomes between 133 AE\u2010COPD patients and 116 CP\u2010COPD patients [Huerta et al., 2013]. Similar to the results of our study, AE\u2010COPD patients had a greater severity of disease than CP\u2010COPD patients. However, in their results, in\u2010hospital mortalities of AE\u2010COPD group and CP\u2010COPD group were 3.0% and 3.4%, respectively, which are quite different from those of our patients especially in the CP\u2010COPD group (1.2% in the AE\u2010COPD group and 12.3% in the CP\u2010COPD group). We thought that these differences might reflect a different severities of illness in the two patient populations. The ICU admission rate of patients between two groups were different (in the Spanish study 3.8% in the AE\u2010COPD group, 2.6% in the CP\u2010COPD group versus 10.8% and 15.7% of the our studied patients in each). This difference might explain the outcome difference between the two groups.",

            "text": "Among patients with a viral infection, with regard to bacterial co\u2010infection, 41.6% of our AE\u2010COPD patients and 50.6% of our CP\u2010COPD patients had a bacterial co\u2010infection, respectively. Notably, among our CP\u2010COPD patients, only viral infection group had significantly better outcomes than the only bacterial infection group or the viral bacterial co\u2010infection group. This finding suggests that when bacterial co\u2010infection complicates viral infection, it can lead to poorer outcomes. However, according to a separate \u03c72 test, the mortality rates of patients with bacterial infection alone and virus\u2013bacteria co\u2010infection were not significantly different. Thus, it seems that the impact of viral infection on the mortality of CP\u2010COPD patients with bacterial infection may not be additive. Our study has several limitations to note. First, because the study was of retrospective design, respiratory virus PCR was not performed for some patients. This may have introduced selection bias to the study sample. However, most of admitted patients (85.8% of AE\u2010COPD patients and 83.1% of CP\u2010COPD patients, respectively) were evaluated by RT\u2010PCR in our hospital. Second, our study was performed at a single center in Korea, and our results may not be fully applicable to other settings. Because nearly all patients were tertiary referrals from other hospitals, the study population might not be representative of the general population. Third, the viruses identified by a sensitive RT\u2010PCR could be bystanders, rather than causative pathogens. If other admitted patients who had neither AE\u2010COPD nor CP\u2010COPD were included as controls, we might indirectly be able to estimate the proportion of non\u2010significant colonizers. However, this is not possible due to the retrospective design of the study. It was also difficult to establish a cause\u2013effect relationship and it is not clear whether people developed AE\u2010COPD or CP\u2010COPD following infection. Fourth, our study did not include control patients with viral infection alone (without AE\u2010COPD or CP\u2010COPD) and it was, thus, difficult to determine the precise role of the virus in mortality due to AE\u2010COPD or CP\u2010COPD. Also, due to the retrospective nature of the study, some data were missing. For example, it was very difficult to obtain an accurate time of transfer from other hospitals and data of prior antibiotics use. Since we often did not know how long a patient was resident in the transferring hospital, we could not take this into account. Finally, since the number of each virus was relatively small, the characteristics of each viral infection could not be compared between the groups.",
