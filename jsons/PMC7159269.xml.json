Since restoring its membership in the UN in 1971 and entering the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has joined almost all multilateral organisations. Following rapid economic growth to become the world's second largest economy, China has transitioned very quickly from aid recipient to aid donor. A 2014 analysis1 showed that China had emerged as an important participant in global health, serving as an essential source of overseas development assistance (ODA) and development assistance for health (DAH), sharing concerns about cross-border infectious disease threats, joining in global health governance, and participating in global sharing of knowledge and technology.",

Historically, the Silk Road was an ancient network of routes that facilitated trade and movement of the arts, culture, religion, knowledge, and medicine, and enhanced relations between people and between countries.6 China's Belt and Road Initiative of the 21st century is primarily a regional plan for economic integration, covering 65 countries that contain 70% of the world's population, 30% of global gross domestic product (GDP), and 75% of world energy reserves.7 The Silk Road has two routes. The Silk Road Economic Belt is a series of land-based economic corridors connecting China with countries in central and western Asia, the Middle East, and eastern and central Europe. The 21st century Maritime Silk Road will traverse the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean, covering southeast and south Asia and extending into sub-Saharan Africa. Both the land and maritime routes eventually connect China, across Asia and Africa, to Europe.8\n",

China's State Council mobilised action across 23 ministries and departments, dispatching a Chinese team to west Africa days after the WHO declared Ebola an Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To do so, China mobilised its military medical cadres and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Altogether, about 1200 Chinese workers, including doctors, public health experts, and military medical officers, were deployed to west Africa.14, 15, 16 China opened a 100-bed treatment unit and established three field demonstration sites in Sierra Leone. The Chinese medical and public health professionals provided free treatment, and zero infection among these workers was achieved through intensive management and training.15, 17, 18, 19 In March 2015, China built a biosafety level-3 laboratory, transporting in all construction materials in only 87 days.14\n",

Like other countries, China also sought to protect its own citizens, since there are about 1\u00b71 million Chinese people living in Africa and an estimated 100 000 African migrants living in Guangzhou, China.20, 21 China tightened airport screening to avoid introduction of people with Ebola into the country, which could spoil its hosting of several major international events (eg, the Youth Olympics Games). Perhaps most importantly, the Ebola epidemic was reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China of 2002\u201303. SARS originated in China and spread to 37 countries, exerted a catastrophic effect on the Chinese economy, and almost halted its international trade. China's economic loss from this epidemic was estimated at $25\u00b73 billion, slowing down GDP growth by 1\u20132% in 2003.16, 22 China was also widely criticised for concealing information and failing to comply with international health regulations.

In tackling Ebola, China learned the difficulties of overseas operational work: communications and operational barriers across ministries (foreign affairs, commerce, health, and the military), between headquarters and the front lines, and working across cultures. Applying China's experience in domestic disease control to Ebola, China instituted disease surveillance with community-based house-to-house case finding, contact tracing, community mobilisation, and health education in Sierra Leone.23 The Chinese workers learned that active surveillance and quarantine, which was effective during the SARS epidemic, requires strong management on the ground and compliant health-seeking behaviour, which can differ across cultures. The medical and public health teams concluded that China needs much stronger professional and organisational capability for future overseas work. Few of the Chinese workers sent to Sierra Leone had previous overseas experience. To sustain the newly built biosafety level-3 laboratory, training of local professionals and sustained funding beyond single-year emergency budgets were needed. Chinese professionals dispatched to fight Ebola have admirably published several papers on their experiences.14, 15, 18, 19 Although their success has been lauded, more systematic monitoring and evaluation is suggested by these studies.",

However, China has also launched its own multilateral funds and banks. Thus, it seems very unlikely that China would simply fill large gaps in funding vacated by other donors. Cooperative ventures might be pursued but not simply on terms established by the existing multilateral framework. For example, increased interconnectivity along the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road will not only bring about international health risks but also new opportunities for cooperation. To this end, China has joined the UN Development Programme in seeking to advance the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially in the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road countries.30 Notably, China has reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Accord on climate change, although the Belt and Road Initiative plans are largely silent on the health dimensions of global warming.",

Indeed, China has reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Climate Accord, despite the announced withdrawal of the USA. Like all major powers, China's participation in multilateral governance will be driven by its geopolitical and economic goals. China is the world's largest trading nation that, in 2013, had a total trade volume of $4 trillion, surpassing the USA.32 China also has about $3 trillion in foreign reserves, and investing abroad will enable the Chinese to make use of idle reserves and promote the Chinese reminbi as a global currency. The Belt and Road Initiative will also harness China's surplus capacity in steel output and state-owned enterprises for building infrastructure. Chinese firms also are confident that they will be competitive in winning contracts of new projects. Since trade will promote the movement of goods, people, and infectious diseases, health protection against pandemic diseases will be essential to achieve economic goals.29 Beyond SARs, China has experienced exportation of infectious diseases from adjacent countries on its western borders, such as polio virus from Pakistan and malaria from southeast Asia.33, 34\n",

The Ebola epidemic and the Belt and Road Initiative, nevertheless, sparked the creation of two new departments dedicated to global health. A NHFPC vice minister has been assigned a newly created portfolio in global health, and the Chinese CDC has established a new global health department. A draft statement about China's global health policy has been circulating for review, and there are active discussions about revamping the NHFPC's Department of International Cooperation, traditionally a health aid-receiving agency, into an outward-looking global health agency. These new health bodies will inject a stronger health component into China's ODA policy, which is under the coordination of the Foreign Aid Department of the Ministry of Commerce. For historical reasons, only China's medical teams are managed directly by the NHFPC; all other health-related projects are planned and managed by the Ministry of Commerce. Over time, the NHFPC might be expected to assume greater responsibility and authority for China's global health work.",
