            "text": "Although previous studies have suggested that the complications and mortality rate related to COVID-19 are substantially lower in the paediatric population, 1 it is reasonable to consider that children with underlying conditions such as cancer will be at increased risk of severe disease. 2, 3 Some reports have examined the impact of COVID-19 in children with cancer; in all cases no deaths or disease-related complications have been reported. [4] [5] [6] In order to prevent the rapid spread of the virus as seen in many European countries, most Latin American countries implemented early epidemiological actions with social distancing, interruptions of commercial activities, transportation, and schooling. Preparation for the pandemic throughout Latin America, in terms of hospital capacity, human resources, and testing capacity is, however, heterogeneous. 7 In this scenario, there is emerging concern about the collateral effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to diagnosis and treatment in children with cancer. 8 In response to this problem, the global paediatric oncology community has summarised some of the anticipated challenges. 9 To examine the potential impact of COVID-19 on the management of children with cancer in Latin America, we did a cross-sectional survey of paediatric oncohaematologists in April 12-19, 2020, early in the spread of the outbreak in the region (appendix p 1). The survey was electronically distributed through the Latin American Society of Pediatric Oncology (SLAOP) email list and St Jude Global regional partners. Additionally, SLAOP's national delegates for each country contacted their centres for an increased response and reviewed the responses from their countries for validation before analysis.",
