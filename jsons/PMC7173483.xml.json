All chlamydiae also encode an abundant protein called the major outer membrane protein (MOMP or OmpA) that is surface exposed in C. trachomatis and C. psittaci but apparently not in C. pneumoniae.\n10 The MOMP is the major determinant of the serologic classification of C. trachomatis and C. psittaci isolates. Chlamydiae are susceptible to antibiotics that interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, including tetracyclines, macrolides, and quinolones.

After infection, the infectious EBs, which are 200 to 400 nm in diameter, attach to the host cell by a process of electrostatic binding and are taken into the cell by endocytosis that does not depend on the microtubule system. EBs are sporelike; they are metabolically inactive but stable in the extracellular environment. Within the host cell, the EB remains within a membrane-lined phagosome, with inhibition of phagosomal\u2013lysosomal fusion. The inclusion membrane is devoid of host cell markers, but lipid markers traffic to the inclusion, which suggests a functional interaction with the Golgi apparatus. Chlamydiae appear to circumvent the host endocytic pathway, inhabiting a nonacidic vacuole that is dissociated from late endosomes and lysosomes. EBs then differentiate into RBs that undergo binary fission. After approximately 36 hours, the RBs differentiate back into EBs. Despite the accumulation of 500 to 1000 infectious EBs in the inclusion, host cell function is minimally disrupted. At about 48 hours, release may occur via cytolysis or a process of exocytosis or extrusion of the whole inclusion, leaving the host cell intact. This strategy is very successful and enables the organism to cause essentially silent chronic infection.",

These different systems produce similar growth characteristics, including loss of infectivity and development of small inclusions that contain fewer EBs and RBs and ultrastuctural findings, specifically, morphologically abnormal RBs, which suggests that they are somehow altered during their otherwise normal development. These abnormal RBs are often called aberrant bodies (ABs). Restriction of certain nutrients has also been shown to induce persistence in chlamydiae. Ultrastructural analysis of IFN-\u03b3\u2013treated C. pneumoniae also reveals atypical inclusions that contain large reticulate-like ABs with no evidence of redifferentiation into EBs.",

In contrast to the previously described models, continuous cultures become spontaneously persistent when both chlamydiae and host cells multiply freely in the absence of stress. C. pneumoniae infection was maintained in HEp-2 and A549 cells for more than 4 years without centrifugation, addition of cycloheximide, or IFN-\u03b3.12 Infection levels in these infected cells were high (70% to 80%). Ultrastructural studies revealed three types of inclusions in these cells. Approximately 90% were typical large inclusions that ranged approximately from 5 to 12 \u00b5m in diameter. The second type (altered inclusions) contained both normal EBs and RBs, but in considerably lower numbers than typical inclusions, and pleomorphic ABs, which were up to four to five times the size of normal RBs (2.5 \u00b5m in diameter); their cytoplasm was homogeneous. The third type of inclusion was small aberrant inclusions, on average 4 \u00b5m in diameter, containing about 60 ABs that were similar in size to normal RBs but appeared electron dense and no longer retained a smooth spherical shape. These dense ABs retained the characteristic chlamydial outer membrane structure, with very little periplasmic space, and the membranes more tightly bound to the chlamydial body, similar to normal RBs. No EBs were observed in these inclusions. These findings show that the developmental cycle of C. pneumoniae can combine the typical development forms with the persistent phase in tissue culture.",

            "text": "Another possible mechanism of chlamydial persistence could be through a direct effect on the host cell, possibly through an effect on apoptosis, which is an important regulator of cell growth and tissue development. Apoptosis is a genetically programmed, tightly controlled process, unlike necrosis, which involves nonspecific inflammation and tissue damage and intracellular enzymes, condensation of nucleus, and cytoplasm and fragmentation. Many microbial pathogens, including chlamydiae, have been found to modulate cellular apoptosis to survive and multiply. Chlamydia spp. have been shown to both induce and inhibit host cell apoptosis, depending on the stage of the chlamydial developmental cycle.13 Chlamydiae protect infected cells against apoptosis as a result of external stimuli during early stages of infection and may induce apoptosis of the host cell during later stages of the life cycle. Thus, chlamydiae may protect infected cells against cytotoxic mechanisms of the immune system, and the apoptosis observed at the end of the infection cycle may contribute to the inflammatory response because apoptotic cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines and facilitate the release of the organism from the infected cells. Studies with IFN-\u03b3\u2013treated cultures have reported that cells infected with C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae resist apoptosis as the result of external ligands, via inhibition of caspace activation. Data from studies with the long-term continuously infected cell model showed marked differences in the effect of C. pneumoniae on apoptosis in acute and chronically infected A549 cells.13 Acute C. pneumoniae infection induced apoptotic changes in A549 cells within the first 24 and 48 hours after infection. Induction of apoptosis in acute infection may facilitate release of C. pneumoniae from the host cell. Chronic C. pneumoniae infection inhibited apoptotic changes within the first 24 hours and up to 7 days. These results suggest that inhibition of apoptosis may help to protect the organism when it is in the intracellular, persistent state.",

Nearly a decade later, however, many of these tests turned out to be highly prone to false-positive results.29, 30 Until recently, not a single NAAT for the detection of C. pneumoniae was commercially available or listed in the in vitro diagnostic (IVD) database of the FDA (www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfivd/index.cfm). Numerous in-house PCR-based tests still are performed, but these assays range from those that are well validated to those that are not validated at all. Although NAATs offer the promise of exquisite sensitivity, theoretically allowing detection of a single organism in a clinical sample, both false-negative and -positive results can and do occur because of a large number of technical issues that were summarized recently.31 Currently, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) technology for the detection of C. pneumoniae should be used.32, 33 RT-PCR offers significant advantages over conventional PCR in its rapidity, the ease with which it can be automated, the potential decreased risk of carryover contamination, and the potential provision of a quantitative result.",

This single test platform enables the detection of numerous viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in a single test. Water is added to hydrate the lyophilized reagents, and the respiratory specimen is added. The pouch is loaded into the FilmArray instrument, and the remainder of the test is completely automated. After extraction of nucleic acid, a nested PCR reaction is performed within the pouch in an entirely closed system. The first-step PCR is a multiplexed reaction containing primers for all of the viral and bacterial targets; the amplicons from the first PCR are then diluted, and a second round of PCR reactions is performed in a multiwell array, each well containing a single primer set targeting a specific pathogen. Both amplification and melt curve analysis allow the FilmArray software to generate a result for each target. The system is very robust, detecting a low concentration of pathogen in the presence of a high concentration of a second pathogen, with results available in 1 hour. The respiratory panel detects adenoviruses, bocaviruses, coronaviruses, influenza A and B, influenza A subtypes (novel H12009, H1, H3), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, as well as B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae.14, 35\n",

However, none are currently approved by the FDA for this indication. The test used most frequently and recommended by the CDC remains the MIF assay.18 Tests based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format are particularly easy to perform and do not need sophisticated laboratory equipment, which makes them the preferentially offered diagnostic chlamydial tool for laboratories. C. pneumoniae, however, is an intracellular pathogen, and the poor correlation between direct detection (e.g., with culture or NAAT) and serologic results is not surprising. Besides specificity issues, it is not at all clear which classes and titers of antibodies might represent acute first infection or reinfection, chronic, persistent, or past C. pneumoniae infection.18 This is true for complement fixation tests (measurement of antibodies against chlamydial lipopolysaccharide\u2014therefore not specific for C. pneumoniae), ELISA-based tests (purified C. pneumoniae EBs or recombinant antigens detected; specificity unclear), and also the gold-standard MIF test (formalinized C. pneumoniae EBs fixed onto glass slides). A serologic test can only be as specific as the antigen used. Cross-reactivity between C. pneumoniae and other Chlamydia species has been shown with the MIF test. Factors such as strain type, purity, and concentration of antigen used, and the assay procedure itself, might contribute to the fact that the MIF is less specific for C. pneumoniae than thought 20 years ago. Data also show significant problems with subjective interpretation and intralaboratory and interlaboratory reproducibility.37 The problems in context with C. pneumoniae serology have been discussed in detail in two recently published review articles.38, 39 For an example of the complexity of this issue, consider that two multicenter pneumonia treatment studies in children showed that although 7% to 13% of the patients in the study had positive culture results and 7% to 18% met the serologic criteria with the MIF test for acute infection, they were not the same patients. Only 1% to 3% of the patients with positive culture results met the serologic criteria, and approximately 70% with positive culture results for C. pneumoniae were seronegative.40\n",

Whether this is secondary to the methods used (most of the recent studies have used RT-PCR) or possible cycling, as is seen with M. pneumoniae, is unknown. Four studies published after 2010, from diverse geographic areas (Europe, Africa, and Thailand), that used RT-PCR found prevalences of C. pneumoniae infection ranging from 0% to 3.8%.52, 53, 54, 55 This was compared with 11.4% in a Chinese study that used MIF serology; 30% of the patients only had a single serum sample (see Table 184-1).56 Early studies that relied on serology suggested that infection in children younger than 5 years was rare; however, subsequent studies with culture or PCR assay have found the prevalence rate of infection in children beyond early infancy to be similar to that found in adults.51 Approximately 50% or more children with culture-documented C. pneumoniae respiratory infection (pneumonia and asthma) show seronegativity with the MIF.51 Prolonged respiratory infection, documented with culture, that lasts from several weeks to several years after acute infection has been reported.57\n",

Study design has been complicated by the fact that macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines all have immunomodulatory activity independent of their antimicrobial activity.78, 79 Any positive treatment outcomes may therefore be the result of antichlamydial or immunomodulatory effects, or a combination of the two. Several uncontrolled studies showed beneficial effects of antibiotics on patients with asthma with proven or presumed C. pneumoniae infection.59, 80 Subsequent placebo-controlled trials attempted to confirm the benefits suggested by these preliminary studies. A placebo-controlled 6-week trial of roxithromycin in patients with asthma who were seropositive for C. pneumoniae showed significantly higher morning peak expiratory flow in the treatment group at the end of treatment but not at subsequent time points.81 In the absence of clear evidence that patients with asthma in this study had persistent C. pneumoniae infection, one could conclude that the treatment effect was the result of the anti-inflammatory action of roxithromycin, which disappeared after stopping the drug. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of telithromycin in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma found reduction of asthma symptoms among those treated with the active drug; however, the study could not adequately assess the effect of infection because only one of 278 enrolled patients was positive for C. pneumoniae with PCR assay of upper airway samples.82 Similarly, in a randomized, controlled study of clarithromycin, the number of asthma patients who were PCR-positive for either C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae was only 12 and therefore was underpowered to test the effect of clarithromycin on asthma outcome variables.83 A randomized controlled trial of minocycline in patients with allergic asthma showed improved asthma symptoms and reduced total serum IgE, a beneficial effect that did not appear to be the result of a respiratory infection with C. pneumoniae; seropositivity for C. pneumoniae was not significantly different between patients and control subjects, and no patient had positive nasopharyngeal cultures for C. pneumoniae.\n84\n",

In conclusion, although diagnosis and treatment of C. pneumoniae infections in patients with asthma with signs and symptoms of an airway infection are recommended, the benefit of using antibiotics with activity against atypical bacteria in patients with asthma without laboratory evidence of infection remains controversial.",

Inflammation of the vessel wall plays an essential role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, erosion, fissure, and eventual rupture of the atheromatous plaques.86 Various markers of systemic inflammation, including C-reactive protein, have been found to predict future cardiovascular events, including nonfatal and fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. Although inflammation is present, the exact cause is still not known. Infectious agents, including cytomegalovirus, human herpesviruses, enteroviruses, Helicobacter pylori, bacteria involved with periodontal disease, and C. pneumoniae have also been investigated as possible causes for this inflammation. The first report that suggested a possible association between C. pneumoniae infection and CAD came from a case-control study from Finland published in 1988, showing that patients with proven CAD were significantly more likely to have antibodies to C. pneumoniae than control subjects selected at random.87 This report was quickly followed by additional seroepidemiologic studies and studies that identified C. pneumoniae in atheroma with various methods, including culture, immunohistochemical staining (IHS), and PCR.38, 39 Animal studies have shown that C. pneumoniae can either induce or enhance the development of atherosclerosis in mice.88 In vitro studies have shown that C. pneumoniae can infect and replicate within monocytes, macrophages, and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and that all are important components of atherosclerotic plaque.86, 89 In vitro infection also results in oxidation of cellular low-density lipoprotein; the production of proinflammatory cytokines involved in atherogenesis, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6 and -1\u03b2, and INF-\u03b1; and the transendothelial migration of neutrophils and monocytes.86, 89\nC. pneumoniae can induce human macrophage foam cell formation in vitro, a key event in early atheroma development.90 However, this may not be specific because the key component appears to be the chlamydial lipopolysaccharide, which is conserved in all chlamydial species, including C. trachomatis.\n",

In 2002, Boman and Hammerschlag38 reviewed 14 seroepidemiologic studies published from 1992 to 2000 and found a great deal of heterogeneity among these studies in terms of the serologic tests used and the criteria for seropositivity. In some studies, an IgG or IgA titer of 1 : 64 or more was used as an indicator of chronic infection; in others, the same criteria were used as indicators of past infection. Nine of these studies used the MIF assay; all were in-house tests. The antigen used was only specified in four of the MIF assays. The remaining studies used a variety of other methods, including genus-specific enzyme immunoassays and whole-cell immunofluorescence. As stated previously, MIF assays are not standardized and are subject to significant operator variation.37 Background seropositivity rates in the general population often exceed 70%, which can also make demonstration of an association between the presence of C. pneumoniae antibodies and CAD difficult. Earlier case-control studies that showed an association were generally small and based on single serum samples, which does not take into account that antibody titers fluctuate over time. A meta-analysis of 12 studies only found combined odds ratios of 1.15 and 1.13 for IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively.91\n",

The possible association of C. pneumoniae and MS was first described in a case study from researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC); this study was then followed by a series of patients from VUMC in which the researchers claimed that they identified the organism with culture and PCR.98 The hypothesis of how C. pneumoniae might cause MS was not clear. The results of subsequent studies from a number of other groups were conflicting, some finding C. pneumoniae DNA in approximately 30% to more than 80% of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients with MS and in approximately 20% of CSF specimens from patients with other neurologic diseases, and others finding none in CSF and brain tissue with culture and PCR.99, 100\n",

Reasons for these discrepant results were discussed and included poor sensitivities of the assays used by JHU, UU, and the CDC or specificity problems with the assays used by VUMC. The primer sets used by VUMC in the multicenter study were analyzed at the CDC and were found to have high sequence similarity to human DNA, as determined with a BLAST (basic local alignment search tool), suggesting that they were not specific for C. pneumoniae.\n102\n",
