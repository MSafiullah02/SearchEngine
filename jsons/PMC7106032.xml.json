Apart from relatively common vasculitides such as Henoch-Sch\u0151nlein purpura (HSP) and Kawasaki disease (KD), most of the primary vasculitic syndromes are rare in childhood, but with a significant attendant morbidity and mortality. Latest developments in the field of paediatric vasculitis include: a) the recent consensus conference for a new international classification of childhood vasculitides b) the identification of various genetic polymorphisms that may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications, and c) novel therapeutic approaches including the increasing use of biologics in cases where current standardized first line treatment fails to induce or sustain remission.",

These criteria are currently being validated and it is anticipated that this will be an important step in providing a \u201cfit for purpose\u201d classification system to be used in future epidemiological studies and clinical trials of paediatric vasculitis.",

Serum IgA levels are increased during the acute phase and a proportion of patients have circulating IgA-containing immune complexes and cryoglobulins [6]. Skin or renal biopsies demonstrate the deposition of IgA (mainly IgA1) in the wall of dermal capillaries and post capillary venules and mesangium [6]. Some studies have found IgA antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (IgA-ANCA) in some patients with HSP, whilst others have shown an increase in IgA-rheumatoid factor or IgA-anticardiolipin antibodies [6]. Recently, galactose deficiency of O-linked glycans in the hinge region of IgA1 has been reported in adults with IgA nephropathy and children with HSP [7]. These aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 proteins form immune complexes that deposit in the mesangium; their binding to mesangial cells stimulates cellular proliferation and overexpression of extracellular matrix components resulting in the typical renal lesions associated with HSP and IgA nephropathy [7].",

Weiss et al performed a meta-analysis based on a comprehensive review of the literature in the Medline database (1956 to January 2007) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register of the literature regarding corticosteroid therapy of HSP [17]. On the basis of reported outcomes among patients with HSP who were treated at diagnosis with corticosteroids compared with patients treated with supportive care only, odds ratios were calculated for the resolution of abdominal pain, the need for surgical intervention secondary to severe pain or intussusception, the likelihood of HSP recurrence, and the development of transient or persistent renal disease. Two of the studies analysed, evaluated prospectively the effect of corticosteroids on abdominal pain duration by using 14 day symptom diaries [18], [19]. In the Huber series a dose of 2 mg/kg/day of prednisolone for 1 week with weaning over weeks 3 and 4 was used [18]. Using median values of total abdominal pain duration, no difference was found between the treatment and the control group. In contrast Ronkainen et al studied 171 patients that were randomised to receive prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks with weaning over the following 2 weeks and reported a significant reduction in the intensity and duration of abdominal pain [19].",

These changes progress to destruction of the media and replacement of the intima and media with fibrous connective tissue, thinning of the media with aneurysm formation, scarring, and stenosis [30]. Coronary-artery rupture is extremely rare but can occur during the subacute phase.

Recently cytoplasmic inclusion antibodies were identified in the ciliated bronchial epithelium of children with fatal acute KD, leading the authors of that study to suggest viral infection as the cause of KD [33].

Combined therapy with aspirin and high dose IVIG given as a single infusion reduces the occurrence of CAA to 9% at 30 days, and 4% at 60 days after the onset of the illness [39]. The prevalence of CAA is inversely related to the total dose of IVIG [40], 2 g/kg of IVIG being the optimal dose, usually given as a single infusion [39], [40]. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing divided lower doses of IVIG (400 mg/kg/day for four consecutive days) versus a single infusion of high dose IVIG (2 g/kg over 10 hours) has clearly shown the therapeutic benefits in the prevention of CAA with the latter regimen [39]. One important practical point, however, is that infants who have cardiac compromise may not be able to tolerate the fluid challenge associated with the high dose single infusion, and consideration of divided doses given over several days may be appropriate for this patient group.",

The corticosteroid regimen used in that study was prednisolone sodium succinate 2 mg/kg/day, 3 times daily, given by intravenous (IV) injection until the fever resolved and then orally until the C-reactive protein (CRP) level normalized. Once CRP normalized, prednisolone doses were tapered over 15 days. They found that that the addition of corticosteroid reduced CAA: in those receiving conventional treatment 11.4% had CAA at one month, compared with 2.2% in those receiving conventional treatment plus corticosteroids [43]. In contrast Newburger et al in a subsequent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effect of the addition of a single dose of intravenous methylprednisolone to standard therapy [44]. They found that this corticosteroid regimen did not improve the CAA outcome in these children. These contrasting results suggest that dose and duration of corticosteroids may be critical to adjunctive efficacy in KD.",

            "text": "Conventional DSA remains an important tool in the initial evaluation of paediatric TA. Increasingly, however, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be useful in detection of early signs of large-vessel disease, and has the added advantage of potentially revealing evidence of ongoing large arterial wall inflammation [73]. One caveat, however, is that MRA may result in false positive diagnoses for TA based on aortic signs in young children. In our experience two pre-school children referred to us with the presumptive diagnosis of TA on the basis of aortic caliber variation observed on MRA turned out to have alternative diagnoses, and with normal aortic anatomy on subsequent formal digital subtraction arteriography.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with radioactive-labeled 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been shown to be useful in monitoring disease activity and response to treatment in preliminary studies [74].

Corticosteroids are still the mainstay of treatment for TA [75]. In addition, MTX, azathioprine, MMF, and cyclophosphamide have been used in children [75]. Cyclophosphamide has been used for children with severe TA refractory to other immunosuppressive drugs [75]. Ozen, et al described 6 children with TA, and treatment with steroid and cyclophosphamide induction followed by MTX was suggested as effective and safe for childhood TA with widespread disease [76]. Anti-TNF therapy might be beneficial in TA, and a high rate of response to TNF inhibitors has been reported [77]. This important topic is considered in more detail elsewhere in this journal. Besides medical therapy, surgical intervention is frequently required to alleviate end-organ ischemia and hypertension resulting from vascular stenoses [78].",
