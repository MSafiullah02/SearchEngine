            "text": "The novel genetic viral-vectored RSV vaccines, designated PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV, represent a new and promising approach to this problem. Each uses RSV proteins F (F0\u0394TM), N and M2-1 as antigen delivered by replication-defective adenovirus (PanAd3) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors. Preclinical models that used homologous and heterologous combinations of these vaccines, including the intra-nasal route, found a single dose of intra-nasal (IN) or intra-muscular (IM) vaccine fully protected the lower respiratory tract from viral replication after challenge, with the IN route also capable of inducing sterilising immunity in the upper respiratory tract. Importantly the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV was not associated with evidence of lung immunopathology.13, 14, 15 In 2015 we progressed to the first trials in humans and demonstrated that delivery of RSV antigen using these replication-defective viral-vectors was safe and capable of robustly boosting both humoral and cellular immune responses in healthy adults aged 18-50 years despite pre-existing natural immunity to RSV.16, 17 Here we report the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in healthy older adults, aged 60-75years, with specific reference to the results from younger adult cohorts who received the same combinations of vaccine.",

No formal sample size calculations were performed and the number of volunteers in each study group was considered standard to assess phase 1 (first-in-man) product safety and tolerability. The four prime/boost combinations tested in older adults were selected from combinations tested in the younger age cohort and from preclinical data. Study volunteers were self-selected individuals responding to open invitation to the trial and provided written informed consent prior to any study procedures. Potential volunteers were excluded if they had any history of significant organ or system disease, any known or suspected alteration of the immune system, previous receipt of a simian adenoviral or MVA-vectored vaccine of any kind or any other significant disease or disorder that presented potential for risk, could influence the results or impair the participants ability to participate in the study (detailed in sTab. 1). Eligible volunteers were assigned to study groups by sequential allocation and were considered enrolled at the first vaccine visit. The primary and secondary objectives were the respective characterisation of safety and immunogenicity of each prime/boost combinations of vaccine (sTab. 2) and end points of the clinical trial were prospectively selected. The methods and results of the safety analysis are presented separately in the supplementary material (sFig. 1, sFig. 2, sTab. 3 and sTab. 4). Secondary end-point measures of immunogenicity were performed observer blinded by use of a randomly generated laboratory identifier. The collection and processing of samples and analysis of immune responses were pre-specified and performed as described previously, and only briefly described here.16, 17 The methods and analysis of intracellular staining with flow cytometry (ICS/FACS) analysis are described in supplementary material.",

A self-cleavage site derived from foot and mouth disease virus 2A releases F0\u0394TM into the supernatant while the N and M2-1 proteins remain intra-cellular. Deletion of the E1 and E4 loci of PanAd3 rendered the adenovirus vector replication-defective and MVA naturally cannot replicate in mammalian cells. The target-doses PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV used in older adults were 5 \u00d7 1010 viral particles (vp) and 1 \u00d7 108 plaque forming units (pfu), respectively.

In contrast, the baseline IgA memory B-cell frequency was much lower and from a large proportion of volunteer samples we could not detect any cells in circulation. The distribution of baseline memory B-cell frequencies was broadly comparable between younger and older adults (sFig. 9). Following IM prime there was a marked expansion of IgG memory B-cells 28-days later of broadly similar magnitude between younger and older study groups who received the same vaccine (Fig. 4\n, and sFig. 9).

The observation for F-specific IgA memory B-cells was that of low baseline frequencies and poor expansion following vaccination irrespective of route, vector or volunteer age.

Baseline differences were observed from younger and older adults, with older adults recording fewer spots per million PBMCs compared with the younger cohorts measured one year earlier (sFig. 11). To allow for differences in baseline immunity we used the fold-change from baseline as an index of vaccine immunogenicity (Fig. 5\nand sFig. 12). We found that IM prime in older adults reproduced and even exceeded the expansion of RSV-specific IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells in peripheral blood seen from the younger cohort. For IM PanAd3-RSV prime the measured geometric mean fold-changes were 3.5 and 6.1 for younger and older volunteers, respectively. IM MVA-RSV prime given to 6 older adults recorded a geometric mean fold-change of 21.6. For IN prime there was no appreciable expansion in RSV-specific IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells in peripheral blood. The effect of the second dose of vaccine, measured 7-days after boost, was that of re-expansion of the circulating RSV-specific IFN\u03b3-producing T-cell population when the vector was MVA regardless of the route of prime. The MVA-RSV boost was responsible for the greatest rises in IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells, although the magnitude of this MVA vector-associated re-expansion was lower in the older adult study groups (geometric mean fold-changes of 6.6 and 3.0 for younger and older adults respectively who received IM prime and 8.8 and 6.1 for younger and older adults respectively who received IN prime). PanAd3 IM homologous boost did not induce a further RSV-specific T-cell response expansion. The relative contribution of responses from each pool of peptides (Fa, Fb, M and N) resulting from natural exposure at baseline were preserved following vaccination (sFig. 13). ICS/FACS analysis, looking at PBMCs from baseline and 14-days after IM PanAd3-RSV prime, showed CD4+ and CD8+ responses for IFN\u03b3, Il2 and IL4 producing T-cells were broadly similar between younger and older adults (sFig. 17).

However, vaccine-induced antibody alone may not be sufficient to protect from severe lower-respiratory tract disease in many adults, and despite the worldwide prevalence of F-specific neutralising antibody the surface expressed F protein target has undergone little temporal evolution suggestive of being under relatively weak selective pressure. For younger adults undergoing human stem cell transplantation the depletion of lymphocytes (not antibody) has been associated with the risk of progression towards the lower-respiratory tract, severe disease and death and serum antibody did not confer protection from infection or appear to modulate disease severity of younger adults undergoing experimental RSV-challenge.30, 31 In addition to needing to generate biologically relevant neutralising antibody, the paralleled restoration of age-related losses of RSV-specific cellular immunity through vaccination may provide the added protection needed for limiting disease severity in the elderly.",

            "text": "We first explored the cellular immune responses that support antibody production and maintenance. A clear signal of vaccine-induced immunogenicity across the spectrum of younger and older adult volunteers came from the F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells (ASCs) measured 7-days after vaccination. Mean F-specific IgG ASC counts of 149 and 173 spots per million PBMCs 7-days following IM PanAd3-RSV prime in younger and older adults respectively compares with 200 spots per million PBMCs observed 10\u201316 days following natural infection in younger and older adults.32 IM MVA-RSV prime in older adults mounted comparable F-specific ASC responses in 3/4 samples. Our vaccine data, observations from natural infection, human experimental RSV-challenge and other vaccine trials have consistently demonstrated the transient appearance of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs in peripheral circulation in the days after stimulation which soon disappear as the cells presumably traffic towards the bone marrow and mucosa.16, 33 The next logical step was to look at how vaccination affected long-lived cells that underpin pathogen-specific adaptive humoral immunity. F-specific IgG memory B-cells circulated in all volunteers but a significant proportion of volunteers had no detectable F-specific IgA memory B-cells in the baseline samples, and IgA responses that were detected were significantly lower cell frequencies compared with the resting IgG memory pool. This dichotomy has been observed in children and paediatric healthcare workers and under controlled experimental RSV-challenge conditions in healthy adults, when there was also a noticeable absence of an IgA memory B-cells in peripheral blood before and after challenge.33, 34 The ICS/FACS analysis appeared to independently corroborate the ELISpot findings of plasmablast and memory B-cell activity together with an absence of IgA memory B-cell responses. The role for IgA memory B-cells in protection from RSV is unclear, but an intriguing prospect concerns the effect of RSV-specific IgA can have at the respiratory mucosa. Under experimental RSV-challenge of healthy adults the quantity of nasal RSV-specific IgA can be associated with the risk of infection, and multivariate analysis from other observational studies have described low nasal IgA RSV-specific antibody titres as an independent risk factor for RSV infection.25, 33\n,\n35 The biology of mucosal and systemic IgA requires further investigation to fully understand and exploit the host repertoire of RSV immunity.",

Data from RSV infection in adults has showed no correlations between the magnitude of the RSV-specific ASC response, RSV neutralising antibody titres and serum anti-F IgG antibody titres.32 The preclinical animal challenge studies that involved IN PanAd3-RSV prime showed that sterilising immunity in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts was not associated with significant immune responses in blood.13, 14 The PanAd3 vector used as an IN influenza vaccine in mice induced greater IgG antibody responses in broncho-alveolar lavage samples and greater CD8+ IFN\u03b3 T-cell responses in the lungs compared with the same vaccine given by intramuscular injection, which generated greater responses in the spleen.15 The intra-nasal, live-attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist) has protective efficacy in infants and has indirectly reduced the incidence of influenza in the elderly, although equally fails to elicit a substantial immune response in blood.43, 44 The lungs are laden with resident antigen-specific T-cells that are not found in blood, especially for respiratory viral infections such as influenza and RSV.45 In adults and protection from severe RSV disease, the baseline population of resident CD8+ (CD69+ CD103+) memory T-cells in the lung (measured from serial bronchoscopy washings) appears to be the main determinant for RSV disease severity.30 The IN route, in younger and older adults, could have resulted in desirable immune responses at the mucosa that were not measured in this trial. The mechanisms behind mucosal vaccination that bring about protective immunity in the respiratory tract, seemingly independent of blood responses, remains a major focus for further investigation.",

Vaccinia-specific serum antibody and T-cell responses persist for life and cross-reactivity from earlier smallpox vaccination in adults was associated with a small but significant impairment in IFN\u03b3 responses to malaria antigen delivered by heterologous prime/boost with recombinant attenuated fowlpox virus FP9 and MVA viral vectors.53 Several trials continue to use and report successes with repeated MVA-vector delivery, suggesting MVA-vector immunity may be a relatively ineffective obstacle to vaccination and older adults who were vaccinated with smallpox vaccine in childhood will become increasingly infrequent in the general population.",

In contrast, 90% of the elderly who are admitted to hospital and who die from severe RSV infection have a least one significant co-morbid condition and infection rates increase with age, and our small study population was not representative of the frail elderly at greatest risk of developing severe disease.5 Although direct and indirect benefit could come from the vaccination of healthy older adults, additional clinical trials will be needed to establish whether these vaccines remain safe and immunogenic in the adults over 75 years with significant co-morbidities. As immune correlates of protection remain elusive, further work is needed to determine whether the immune responses to these vaccines, and especially IN prime, can contribute towards protection from severe disease. Finally, the inclusion of the RSV F-protein in nearly all RSV vaccine candidate reflects the fact that this antigen is well conserved across RSV subtypes with little temporal variation and a target of both serum neutralising antibody and T-cell epitopes. Antibodies directed towards epitopes restricted to the pre-fusion (pre-F) trimeric structure of the RSV F protein are significantly more potent in conferring viral neutralisation, and it remains unknown whether the F-protein antigen used in PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV (F0\u0394TM) presented pre-F as well as the more stable post-F epitopes for the induction of serum neutralising antibody responses.54, 55, 56, 57\n",
