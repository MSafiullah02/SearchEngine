Acute sore throat is one of the most common complaints associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) that result in presentation at general practice surgeries (2) or local pharmacy stores for treatment. Approximately a quarter of the population in England and Wales will consult their physician each year because of a respiratory tract infection (3) . Respiratory tract infections that include URTIs and lower respiratory tract infections are the reason for 60% of all antibiotic prescribing in general practice, resulting in significant costs to the healthcare system (4) .",

Contrary to commonly held historical beliefs, bacterial infections are not the most common cause of sore throats. The most common bacterial cause, group A b-haemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), only account for approximately 20% of all sore throats in adults and young children (5) . In fact, up to 80% of sore throats in adults are caused by viruses (5, 6) , such as influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and rhinovirus (7) .

This study was designed to determine the analgesic properties of amylmetacresol and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC \u2044 DCBA) throat lozenges (Strepsils \u00d2 ) in the relief of acute sore throat caused by upper respiratory tract infections. Methods: Patients (n = 310) were randomly assigned to receive AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges (n = 155) or nonmedicated placebo lozenges (n = 155). After baseline assessments, patients completed three rating assessments at 10 timepoints from 5 to 20 min after first dose. Subsequent lozenges were taken as required, and assessments were made at the end of Day 1, 24 h after first dose, and at the end of Days 2 and 3. Analgesic properties were assessed by comparing severity of throat soreness and sore throat relief ratings. Difficulty in swallowing and functional impairment scores were also assessed. Results: Amylmetacresol \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges reduced throat soreness at 5 min after first dose, which persisted for 2 h and was significantly different vs. non-medicated lozenges at all assessment timepoints for the duration of the 3-day study. Similar significant effects were observed with sore throat relief, easing of difficulty with swallowing and functional impairment scores. There were no differences in adverse events reported between treatment groups. Conclusion: Amylmetacresol \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges provide rapid analgesic effects that last for 2 h, providing ongoing relief long after the lozenge has dissolved. The superior analgesic effects and improvements in functional impairment scores observed with AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges translate into pain relief benefits that are clinically meaningful and are thus a suitable OTC treatment option for patients in the self-management of acute sore throat.",

Several studies exist to support the efficacy and safety of AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges in the relief of acute sore throat pain (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . However, many of these studies were performed on small number of patient and were insufficiently powered to draw strong statistical conclusions. In addition, to date, no studies have examined the effect of throat lozenges on everyday activities impaired by sore throat-related pain \u2044 symptoms. Therefore, this study was conducted in a larger group of patients to further examine the analgesic and functional benefits of AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges vs. non-medicated placebo lozenges in patients with acute sore throat over a period of 3 days.",

For the analysis relating to the number of patients who reported being free from symptoms, a small percentage of patients were symptom free at the end of Day 1 and 24 h after first dose in both treatment groups, but this was not significantly different. However, there was a significant difference between treatment groups in favour of the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges at the end of Days 2 and 3. At the end of Day 2, 16% of patients who took the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges became symptom free compared with 6% of patients who took the non-medicated lozenges [p < 0.01; odds ratio (OR): 3.39; 95% CI: 1.48, 7.77].

When asked at 5 min after first dose whether any relief was felt from the moment the lozenge was consumed, 101 \u2044 154 (66%) patients in the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group reported experiencing relief compared with 23 \u2044 147 (16%) in the non-medicated lozenges group; this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). When asked at 2 h after first dose whether they felt any better than before the lozenge was taken, 98 \u2044 151 (65%) patients in the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group said yes compared with 40 \u2044 152 (26%) patients in the non-medicated lozenges group (p < 0.0001). Type of pain relief experienced. In answer to the question 'How can you describe the type of relief this lozenge gave you?', the most popular terms give by the patients for the type of relief experienced with the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges were 'soothing relief', 'soreness relief' and 'coating relief'. Significantly more subjects in the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group gave more favourable responses for all seven categories of relief reported in Table 3 . When asked about the importance of each of the types of relief descriptions, the majority of patients in the study, i.e. 228 \u2044 308 (74%), rated 'soothing relief' as being very or extremely important to them. Throat-related aspects of relief experienced. AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges were considered by patients to provide relief deeper within the throat and to be more moisturising \u2044 lubricating, soothing and coating than the non-medicated lozenges. The differences between treatment groups were statistically significant (all p < 0.0001; Table 4 ). Overall lozenge consumption up to the end of Day 3. There was no statistical difference between treatment groups in terms of the mean total number of lozenges consumed. The difference between LS mean values was )1.18 (95% CI: )2.50, 0.14); p = 0.08 for the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges vs. non-medicated lozenges group. Overall rescue medication (paracetamol) consumption. During the first 24 h after first dose, patients in both treatment groups consumed approximately two doses of rescue medication, which increased to approximately five doses by Day 3. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups at both timepoints (p = 0.21 and p = 0.41, respectively). Concomitant medication ongoing at randomisation and started during study. Fifty-two percentage of patients in the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group compared with 60% in the non-medicated lozenges group were taking concomitant medication (e.g. anti-acne preparations, anti-emetics, anti-epileptics, anti-histamines, diuretics and antibacterials for systemic use, etc.) at randomisation; 0.6% (n = 1) of whom from each group was taking a systemic antibacterial medication. During the course of the study, i.e. after receiving the lozenges, an additional five patients from the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group (i.e. total 3.2%) and an additional seven patients Table 3 Results obtained in answer to the question 'How can you describe the type of relief this lozenge gave you?'

There was no difference between the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges and non-medicated lozenges group in relation to the proportion of patients reporting AEs, i.e. 16% vs. 16%, respectively. A total of 43 events were reported in the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group vs. 41 events in the non-medicated lozenges group. In both treatment groups, the majority of AEs reported were mild with only five treatment-emergent events classified as severe. Most AEs were events related to the patients' URTIs, such as headache, cough, chills and pyrexia. The most common AE reported was headache, with 13 (8%) patients reporting 17 occurrences in the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group and nine (6%) reporting nine occurrences in the non-medicated lozenges group. In both treatment groups, none of the reported events was definitely related to treatment, one event was probably related (i.e. severe mouth ulceration by patient in AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges), and a further five events of possible relationship were reported [four from the non-medicated lozenge group: two of whom reported tongue disorders, one nausea, one tongue ulceration and one from the AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges group (mouth ulceration)].",

The rapid analgesic effects were also supported by the patient questionnaire survey component of this study. Peak effects of all three variables were observed 75 min after the first dose, which suggests that the analgesic benefits provided by AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges were not restricted to only the time that the lozenge was present in the mouth, and that relief benefits continued long after the lozenge had dissolved. As earlier studies have shown, the mean time for an AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenge to dissolve in the mouth is 6.77 \u00b1 2.01 min (10) . Furthermore, release of the active ingredients AMC and DCBA into the mouth was demonstrated to begin almost immediately after the lozenge was administered, with measureable quantities present in the saliva at 1 min and peak salivary concentrations at 4 min, followed by a steady decline (10) . This time-course release of active ingredients coincides with the findings of this study, because significant analgesic effects on throat soreness and sore throat relief, as well as on difficulty in swallowing were observed at the 5-min assessment timepoint; patients expressed a sense of relief from the moment they took a lozenge. More importantly, data from this study support the notion that AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges have a faster onset of analgesic action than nonmedicated lozenges, as indicated by the greater than 80-times shorter median time first to report of 'moderate' pain relief data. The multiple-dose data for changes in sore throat severity, difficulty in swallowing and sore throat relief supported the freedom from symptoms data and in that the improvements observed with AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges compared with nonmedicated lozenges increased over the 3-day study period. The greatest differences were observed at the end of Day 3, which suggests that continued use of AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges over a 3-day period can significantly benefit patients, with more patients likely to experience greater improvements in throat soreness, faster pain relief, greater easing of difficulty in swallowing and freedom from symptoms than those on non-medicated lozenges.",

This was because 5-min assessment timepoints were not included in previous studies, and so it was not possible until now to observe any effect at that earlier timepoint. This is the first study to investigate the impact of throat lozenges on functional impairment scores of everyday activities in adult patients with acute sore throat. The other studies that have been conducted that also include functional activity as an outcomes measure compared orally administered analgesics, and not throat lozenges. For example, a study conducted by Weckx et al. in 2002 examined the effects of celecoxib vs. diclofenac on the symptoms of viral pharyngitis and included quality-of-life outcome measures, such as patient's global assessment of disease activity and patient's functional activity (26) . Whereas functional activity in the study by Weckx et al. was assessed using a categorical scale ranging from 0 (able to work and function normally in all activities) to 3 (working, studying or housekeeping activities severely impaired \u2044 unable to perform; and requiring bed rest) (26) , this study utilised a different functional impairment scale that ranged from 0 = would not interfere at all to 10 = would completely interfere and assessed eight specific daily activities.

Results demonstrated herein show significant improvements in functional impairment scores of these daily activities that are most affected by sore throat in patients treated with AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges compared with non-medicated throat lozenges. Thus, AMC \u2044 DCBA throat lozenges not only provide clinically meaningful pain relief, but they also allow patients to re-engage in their everyday activities and carry on with their daily lives, thereby further supporting this treatment as a suitable treatment option in the self-management of acute sore throat.",
