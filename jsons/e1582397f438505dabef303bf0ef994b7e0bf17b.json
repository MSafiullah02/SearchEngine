Sinus disease may be a part of multisystem or systemic conditions that frequently also involve the nasal passages, eyes, upper and lower airways, and even the gastrointestinal tract. It has been proposed that parts of the human airway from top to bottom, including the nasal passages, sinuses, pharynx, bronchi, and bronchioles, are all of the same histomorphological makeup. The corollary of this theory is that a common airway will be uniformly susceptible to any insults or disease processes. Diseases of the lower and upper respiratory tract, therefore, are all intricately linked. The truth is, as always, not that simple. The reason for the interrelationships between these diseases may not be simply based on a single airway theory, but on systemic changes in immunologic paradigms of the individual during his or her lifetime. For example, immunologic and autoimmune conditions that affect both the sinuses and the lower airway are well known, as in the case of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis).

Throughout history, the link has been consolidated, and our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms behind this link has been cultivated, and now it is no longer simply an intuitive or presumed relationship. Several mechanisms are in play, and these involve neural, vascular, immunologic, and physical pathways. It is now known that there are anatomical and histomorphological similarities between the upper and lower airways that would lead one to believe that effects on one part of the airway should be duplicated in other parts. However, there are also differences between the upper and lower airways. The relationship between the upper and lower airways may in fact be mediated by a multitude of factors. Nasobronchial refl exes may trigger vascular changes between the two parts of the airway. Allergen challenge to one part of the airway may trigger local changes that can lead to similar changes in other parts of the airway but may also mediate infl ammatory effects by a systemic infl ammatory response, leading to infi ltration of infl ammatory cells and generation of infl ammatory cytokines in distant sites. It has been shown that this may involve the action of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and that Th1 cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 may actually provide a protective effect. There are similar cytological changes in nasal polyp tissue and lower airway tissue, but polyps themselves are not often seen in the lower airway.
