Serious shortcomings and delays in action by the authorities [1,2] have had occupational health as well as public health consequences. Thus, National Health Service (NHS) staff who either had Covid-19 symptoms or were contacts have been denied RT\u2013PCR swab tests for viral RNA with many NHS occupational health services (OHS) limited in their access to tests [3]. This resulted in essential staff being held back by mandated quarantine even when they might have been able as well as willing to return unto the breach [3]. There are worrying reports of new or continuing swab positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA even after post-symptomatic quarantine, as well as of poor or inconsistent sensitivity of the swab tests [4]. These factors lead to a significant risk of health care-associated infection and of horizontal transmission among staff. A wide-ranging policy including an increase in widespread, repeated and reliable tests will be needed not only in the hospital front lines, but in primary and social care and other sectors which might be at risk of collapse while sustaining the fabric of our society [5].",

            "text": "Like the WHO, the UK Government had learnt from past RNA virus epidemics, was well aware of the pandemic threat and had undertaken risk-register planning as well as exercises leading to valuable recommendations. Yet by the time the pandemic struck \u2018emergency stockpiles of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) had severely dwindled in the years of austerity. The training to prepare key workers for a pandemic had been put on hold for two years while contingency planning was diverted to deal with a possible no-deal Brexit\u2019 [2]. Early steps to source PPE were weak, and repeated opportunities to work collaboratively with our neighbours to procure substantial quantities of PPE appear to have been missed, possibly for political reasons [6]. Some of the more technical aspects of PPE are considered in a companion contribution in this journal. However, it is worth noting that in 2008, the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) was well aware of concerns of the inadequacy of \u2018surgical masks\u2019 as PPE. It had aptly commissioned research comparing these with respirators and the study concluded that \u2018Live viruses could be detected in the air behind all surgical masks tested. By contrast, properly fitted respirators could provide at least a 100-fold reduction\u2019 [7]. The widespread reported shortcomings in the availability or standards of PPE have left large numbers of NHS or other workers without adequate protection [8,9]. Recent amended guidance has confirmed the suspicion that although guidance and policy may have a foundation in \u2018the science\u2019 it often becomes constrained by the policy and outcomes of the executive [10].",

            "text": "Lessons must be learnt at several levels\u2014not least from suspected adverse exposures of individuals at work. With at least 100 tragic deaths of UK health workers at the time of writing [10] it is a matter of grave concern that Mr Hancock, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, when questioned at a House of Commons Select Committee sitting apparently only considered employers as investigators of the deaths of NHS staff [11]. For reasons which should be obvious, exemplary British law has long provided for such matters to be investigated independently by other bodies. The HSE has confirmed that unintended occupational exposures to the SARS-CoV-2 (\u2018dangerous occurrences\u2019), and Covid-19 disease or deaths with \u2018reasonable evidence that it was caused by exposure at work\u2019 are reportable (statutorily by employers) as a \u2018dangerous occurrence\u2019 or as a \u2018disease\u2019 under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) [12]. Such reports are then followed by HSE investigation, with the prospect of further action. Arguably an even higher degree of forensic scrutiny, and one which is held in public, can be expected from the coroners (or analogous officers such as the \u2018Procurator Fiscal\u2019 in Scotland). Doctors have a legal duty to notify a senior coroner of a death if \u2018the registered medical practitioner suspects that the person\u2019s death was due to \u2026 disease attributable to any employment held by the person\u2019 [13]. As the statutory instrument makes clear, the obligation to notify the coroner is triggered by a mere suspicion on behalf of the notifying doctor. If the coroner deems that an inquest is necessary relevant witnesses can be summoned to testify. The coroner is entitled to make \u2018Reports on Action to Prevent Future Deaths\u2019 which may compel any addressees such as the HSE to respond. These legal provisions are designed to protect other workers. Therefore it is disappointing to note that NHS Covid-19 guidance makes no mention of RIDDOR responsibilities. Moreover the statement (3c) [14] that \u2018Where an attending medical practitioner cannot complete an MCCD (Medical Certificate of Cause of Death), the death should only be notified to the coroner if there is no other medical practitioner who can complete the MCCD\u2019 might lead readers to conclude that no other obligation exists besides the MCCD.",

In due course more sophisticated occupational epidemiology studies, such as using the UK Biobank cohort, would determine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, and Covid-19 morbidity and mortality in relation to exposure. The exposure variables would include occupation, extent of protection and if possible estimates of the very important metric of \u2018viral dose\u2019 from contending with patients shedding a high viral load [15].
