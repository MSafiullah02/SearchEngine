CEUS is a technique that involves the intravenous introduction of microbubbles consisting of a phospholipid shell surrounding a perflourocarbon gas (sulphur hexaflouride) the approximate size of red blood cells that can cross the capillary bed with transpulmonary stability. The result is a truly intravascular contrast agent, which can be detected using contrast specific modes on ultrasound. As a result, areas without contrast enhancement can be identified as being avascular.",

We were able show that these areas of irregularity, labelled as subpleural consolidation by Peng et al. were avascular and therefore most likely to represent 3\u20135 mm microinfarcts. Conversely, non-thrombotic consolidation would be seen to have some enhancement; a process not appreciated using other imaging modalities due to the superior spatial resolution of ultrasound. Anecdotally, we have also seen these areas resolve with clinical improvement. It is becoming apparent that severe cases of COVID-19 are characterised by hyperinflammation and a thrombotic phenomenon. The theory of an underlying thrombotic process also corresponds with studies identifying admission D-dimer, prothrombin time and thrombocytopenia as prognostic markers [3]. Immuno-thrombosis is used to describe the interaction between platelets, coagulation factors and innate immune effector systems that, during an infection, results in secondary thrombus formation.",
