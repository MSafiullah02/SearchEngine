Research insights, as well as failed attempts to identify sepsis-specific disease-modifying therapies, have highlighted the incredible variability of this syndrome at the individual patient level1. Appropriately, the current consensus definition of sepsis \u2500 \u201ca life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection\u201d \u2500 is broad, reflecting the intrinsic heterogeneity of the disease2. The source of this heterogeneity is multifaceted: infection aetiologies vary, individual host comorbidities and genetics are unique, and the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment differ from patient to patient1,3. These factors not only impact the evolution of sepsis at the individual patient level but also their responses to a therapeutic intervention.",

Generally, enrichment refers to the selection of a subgroup of patients who are more likely to respond to a given therapy, when compared with an unselected population11. Enrichment strategies can be further categorized as prognostic or predictive. Prognostic enrichment refers to the selection of patients with a higher likelihood of having a disease-related outcome of interest, such as mortality5,10,11. Employment of this strategy is particularly important when considering the risk-to-benefit ratio of a potential therapy, as therapies carrying more than minimal risk might only be justified in patients with a higher likelihood of a disease-related event5. Additionally, the use of prognostic enrichment strategies is an important tool in study design, as preferentially selecting patients with higher event rates can both improve the power of the study and reduce the number of patients needed for enrolment11. A pertinent example of this concept is the CONSENSUS trial, which demonstrated in a relatively small sample size (n = 253) that the ACE inhibitor enalapril significantly reduced mortality in patients with severe congestive heart failure, whereas subsequent similar studies that included patients with varying illness severity required thousands of patients to demonstrate a drug benefit12.",

A classic example of this type of enrichment is demonstrated by the successful use of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the gene HER2 (also known as transmembrane receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB2), in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer13. However, predictive enrichment requires a clear understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the disease of interest, often making these strategies more challenging to develop and employ than prognostic enrichment strategies. This is particularly true in the context of sepsis, wherein there is no unifying targetable biological mechanism analogous to that described above for HER2-positive breast cancer.",

From approximately 80 candidate genes identified, we subsequently reduced the list to 12 genes based on two a priori criteria. The first criterion was biological plausibility linking the gene to sepsis biology, based on existing knowledge. The second criterion was the ability to measure the protein product of the gene in serum. These 12 initial PERSEVERE biomarkers were subsequently reduced to five biomarkers using classification and regression tree (CART) methodology to develop a model that estimated the risk of 28-day mortality among children with septic shock (PERSEVERE). This approach provided a potential strategy for prognostic enrichment that could inform clinical decision-making and trial design18,32. Since its inception, this model has been prospectively validated and recalibrated as PERSEVERE-II (which includes platelet count in addition to the original biomarkers)19,20 and has been used to design a comparable model for adult patients with septic shock21. Most recently, PERSEVERE-II was remodelled to include mRNA biomarkers (PERSEVERE-XP), further increasing its predictive performance22.",

Instead, these strategies seek to group patients primarily on the basis of biological commonalities with the overarching goal of identifying patients likely to respond to a given therapeutic intervention. Efforts by investigative teams to subgroup patients with sepsis based on gene expression signatures have led to the development of four major classification systems, which are outlined below.",

Patients classified as endotype A had higher rates of mortality, even after correction for severity of illness, age and comorbidities; this was particularly true if allocation to endotype A persisted over the first 72 h of illness34. From a molecular standpoint, endotype A was characterized by repression of genes associated with adaptive immunity and glucocorticoid receptor signalling25. In line with this molecular signature, the prescription of corticosteroids in patients assigned to endotype A was independently associated with increased risk of mortality28. As the use of corticosteroids in the management of septic shock continues to be an unresolved topic of controversy, and the field is contemplating the use of therapeutic strategies to augment the adaptive immune response, these paediatric endotypes might represent a predictive enrichment strategy that enhances future clinical trial enrolment.",

The complex interaction between age and sepsis subgrouping was demonstrated in a study that attempted to assign paediatric endotypes A and B to patients from the adult GAinS cohort37. Although the proportions of adult patients assigned to endotypes A and B were similar to those observed in paediatric patients, the associated differences in mortality noted in the paediatric subgroups were not replicated in the adult cohort. However, when further stratified by age, there was a significant interaction among SRS assignment, endotype assignment and age. Specifically, younger patients co-assigned to SRS1 and endotype A had a substantially higher risk of mortality, compared with the other possible combinations of age, endotype and SRS assignment37. In addition, adults co-assigned to SRS1 and endotype A had the highest rate of mortality, compared with the other three possible co-assignment groups. Further study on the impact of developmental age on the host immune response to sepsis is necessary. The aforementioned observations suggest that any attempts to unify the different sepsis subgroups for the purposes of prognostic and predictive enrichment will require consideration of patient age and different classification systems for paediatric and adult patients might be required.",

            "text": "The first clinical trial to utilize a quasi-predictive enrichment strategy for sepsis used a corticotropin stimulation test (also known as the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test) to identify patients more likely to benefit from corticosteroid therapy45. Although the stimulation test results were not used in a prospective manner to guide therapy, in a pre-specified stratified analysis, corticotropin \u2018non-responders\u2019 who received hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone had reduced risk of death, whereas the corticotropin \u2018responders\u2019 did not benefit from hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. However, these results were not replicated in the follow-up CORTICUS trial45,46. In another example, the MONARCHS trial tested the efficacy of an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody in patients with sepsis after enrichment based on blood concentrations of IL-6; patients with a greater degree of systemic inflammation were hypothesized to have higher circulating levels of IL-6 (ref.47). The monoclonal antibody had no efficacy in the overall cohort or in the subgroup with lower IL-6 concentrations, but the researchers reported a marginal survival benefit among the subgroup with the highest IL-6 concentrations47. The ACROSS trial assessed the ability of acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) to reduce oxidative injury in patients with severe sepsis. The investigators attempted to enrich the study cohort by selecting patients with detectable plasma cell-free haemoglobin, a marker of oxidative stress. Although acetaminophen did not reduce oxidative injury (as measured by F2-isoprostane levels) at treatment day 3, it did result in lower serum creatinine levels, suggesting that the treatment might have been potentially protective against sepsis-associated AKI48. The EUPHRATES trial used a rapid endotoxin assay to enrol patients with high endotoxin levels for randomization to standard therapy plus polymyxin B haemoperfusion or sham haemoperfusion49. Despite the a priori selection of patients with higher endotoxin concentrations, the use of polymyxin B haemoperfusion did not improve survival compared with the sham haemoperfusion group49. Finally, the SCARLET trial utilized the international normalized ratio and platelet count \u2500 two readily available laboratory tests \u2500 to identify patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy who might benefit from recombinant human thrombomodulin therapy50. Unfortunately, despite this pragmatic predictive enrichment approach, treatment with thrombomodulin was not associated with reduced mortality50.",

Although these single biomarker enrichment strategies are pragmatic and clinically attractive, perhaps a major lesson learned from these studies is that future enrichment strategies for sepsis will need to evolve to capture the biological complexity of sepsis. This improved enrichment will become increasingly important as newer, more invasive and costly therapies are proposed. A pertinent example is extracorporeal cytokine removal, a potential therapy for sepsis currently being studied with some early promise51.

            "text": "With regard to the secondary analysis of existing data, thus far the role of adjunctive corticosteroid use in septic shock is perhaps the question that has been most robustly examined via post-hoc analysis. Unfortunately, several large clinical trials reported competing conclusions regarding the benefit and safety of corticosteroids in septic shock45,46,52\u201356 making it difficult to translate the results of those trials to the bedside. However, subsequent studies examined the role of prognostic and predictive enrichment to retrospectively select subsets of patients more likely to benefit from corticosteroid treatment. In 2014, Funk and colleagues noted in a retrospective analysis of a multicentre study of low-dose corticosteroid administration in sepsis that patients with higher severity of illness scores who received steroids had lower mortality than an unselected group57. Another study attempted to utilize a similar prognostic enrichment approach and examined a large heterogeneous group of paediatric patients stratified by PERSEVERE mortality risk, but failed to demonstrate any benefit from treatment with corticosteroids among any of the PERSEVERE-based risk groups58. However, in a subsequent study, combining prognostic enrichment (PERSEVERE) with paediatric endotype A or B assignment enabled the retrospective identification of a subset of paediatric patients who seemed to benefit from treatment with corticosteroids59. In this study, endotype B patients with an intermediate to high baseline PERSEVERE mortality risk who received corticosteroids had a reduced risk of a complicated disease course compared with the other possible combinations of mortality risk and endotype assignments59. Similarly, a secondary analysis of the VANISH clinical trial utilized predictive enrichment to predict corticosteroid responsiveness. In this analysis, randomization to corticosteroids was associated with increased risk of mortality among patients allocated to SRS2 (ref.36). Although these studies were limited by their post-hoc nature, this strategy of combining prognostic and predictive enrichment to select patients who may benefit from (or be harmed by) corticosteroids is an important model to be replicated in future studies, particularly when considering prospective trial design. Of note, the SHIPSS trial is an ongoing double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of adjunctive hydrocortisone60. This trial will include PERSEVERE for prognostic enrichment and endotyping for predictive enrichment. Although these enrichment strategies will not be used to prospectively inform enrolment procedures, they will be used in pre-specified post-hoc analyses to validate the existence of a subgroup of children more likely to benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids.",

            "text": "The utilization of prognostic and predictive enrichment in evaluating patients with septic shock has also been applied to other controversial topics and previously failed therapies. For example, the impact of positive fluid balance in critically ill patients, including those with septic shock, is a growing area of research and controversy61. Using a prognostic enrichment strategy, a study of a cohort of paediatric patients with septic shock found that positive fluid balance was associated with increased mortality among those with low baseline mortality risk, but not among those with moderate or high risk of mortality on admission62. Recombinant human activated protein C, which had been previously associated with reduced mortality but increased bleeding events in patients with severe sepsis63, was subsequently shown to be even more beneficial in patients with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation64. These findings indicate that identifying patients with DIC might represent a potential predictive enrichment strategy to select patients in whom the potential benefit of the therapy might outweigh the bleeding risk. Unfortunately, attempts at utilization of this enrichment strategy in subsequent prospective trials have failed to demonstrate a mortality benefit from treatment with recombinant human activated protein C, again suggesting that the enrichment strategy could not capture the biological complexity of sepsis50,65. Similarly, the use of a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, a promising potential therapy given the well-described role of IL-1 in the inflammatory response to sepsis, failed to show a definitive benefit in several clinical trials66\u201368. However, a retrospective subgroup analysis demonstrated that stratification by pre-randomization concentrations of endogenous plasma IL-1 receptor antagonist showed that those with high plasma IL-1 receptor antagonist concentrations appeared to benefit from recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist therapy69. Similarly, the aforementioned EUPHRATES randomized clinical trial found that targeted polymyxin B haemoperfusion for patients with septic shock and high circulating endotoxin levels did not reduce mortality49. However, a subsequent post-hoc analysis that excluded patients with extreme levels of endotoxin burden showed that patients in the polymyxin B haemoperfusion group had a significant improvement in mean arterial pressure and an increased number of ventilator-free days, as well as a trend towards decreased mortality, compared with the sham haemoperfusion group70. These examples clearly demonstrate the potential benefits of utilizing prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies to reconsider our current understanding of targeted sepsis therapies and to establish a framework from which to continue to develop and improve them.",

Calfee and colleagues used plasma biomarkers and latent class analysis to identify two ARDS subphenotypes71,72 with potential differential responses to therapy, including fluid management and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs73,74. In a subsequent study, significant differences in outcomes were observed between patients with ARDS who were assigned to different paediatric sepsis endotypes, with endotype A patients having significantly higher mortality and a more complicated course of disease than endotype B patients75. Given the clinical and biological overlaps between sepsis and ARDS, parameters successfully employed in enrichment strategies for patients with ARDS might also be relevant to patients with sepsis and vice versa.",

This protein is a biomarker of renal tubular injury and both serum and urine NGAL have been demonstrated in multiple studies to be highly sensitive but not specific markers of AKI in children with septic shock88,89,92,98. Another early candidate serum biomarker was C-terminal afrin fragment, which was shown in one study to be associated with higher incidence of AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy85. Several more candidate biomarkers have been subsequently proposed: serum heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (HFABP)89, urine soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1)86,98, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1; also known as hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1)90, netrin-1 (ref.90) and the combination of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2; also known as metalloproteinase inhibitor 2) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7)91. These proteins have all been shown to be independent, sensitive markers of sepsis-associated AKI. In particular, urinary netrin-1 and KIM-1 were shown to rise as early as 1 h after ICU admission, a timeline with promise for enabling early prediction of sepsis-associated AKI90. However, although some of these single and combination biomarker strategies have demonstrated some capability for earlier detection of sepsis-associated AKI, they have not yet provided strategies for prognostic or predictive enrichment for these patients. Given the heterogeneity of sepsis outlined in this Review, a single biomarker strategy alone is unlikely to result in a successful precision medicine approach for sepsis-associated AKI.",

In another study, the combination of high central venous pressure and elevated renal resistive indices, as measured by ultrasound in patients with sepsis, was found to be a sensitive, early predictor of sepsis-associated AKI95. More recently, a pilot study combining sequential organ failure assessment scores and biomarker measurements (specifically, serum and urine NGAL) demonstrated the ability to predict AKI and mortality with good sensitivity and specificity96.

Measurement of these five candidate serum biomarkers enabled CART analysis to determine the probability of AKI on day 3 after presentation with septic shock93.

Given that patients assigned to sepsis endotype A are characterized by repression of genes associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) signalling pathway, the investigators proposed that PPAR\u03b1-driven fatty acid metabolism was a potential mechanism underlying the association with severe AKI99. This theory is further supported by the fact that PPAR\u03b1-deficient mice had higher rates of kidney injury than wild-type mice challenged with sepsis; this experimental model might enable future mechanistic studies99. This preliminary work provides some insight into potential biologic targets for the understanding and treatment of sepsis-associated AKI, but considerably more work remains to be done.

Unlike the application of genomic technologies for clinical oncology, decision-making among critically ill patients with sepsis must occur within a very short time frame and thus requires actionable data within hours101. This obstacle prompted researchers to test the feasibility of using smaller numbers of genes for patient subclassification23,30,31,102. These simplified approaches appear to yield reliable classifications, but require further testing. Other promising strategies that might bring this technology to the bedside include the use of protein and metabolomics biomarkers. However, more collaboration with industry is needed to develop technologies with the reliability and timeliness required for use in a critically ill patient.",

            "text": "Another important issue relates to the basic questions of what tissue to test and when. Until now, the vast majority of genomic work in sepsis has focused on peripheral blood leukocytes. This is logical for a variety of reasons, most notably because leukocytes are directly involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis and because access to whole blood (and therefore, leukocytes) is relatively non-invasive and requires relatively minimal processing103\u2013105. However, the gene expression patterns of circulating leukocytes might not accurately reflect the pattern of other relevant immune cells that are not practically accessible in critically ill patients (for example, alveolar macrophages, splenic lymphocytes or kidney immune cells)101, nor do they provide organ-specific gene expression information. Continued investigation of the biological mechanisms of sepsis will help us to ascertain what cells other than leukocytes might be relevant for analysis in patients with sepsis. An emerging technology that might not only enhance our mechanistic understanding of sepsis but also help to identify potential therapeutic targets is single-cell RNA sequencing. This technique provides considerably more detailed information about gene expression at an individual cellular level than analyses based on bulk RNA106. A current ambitious and relevant example of how organ-specific information may be utilized is the \u201cKidney Precision Medicine Project\u201d, which is aimed at advancing our understanding of acute and chronic kidney disease by creating a database of kidney biopsy specimens107,108. The creation of such a large-scale repository of samples will undoubtedly lead to significant advances in the field, and should be a model to be replicated in other disease processes.",

            "text": "Finally, the question of when to test is also very important. The timing of sepsis onset in a patient cannot be reliably known and experimental studies have demonstrated that genomic changes in response to endotoxin or other forms of inflammation are rapid and dynamic109. Therefore, when collecting samples at a particular time point after initial presentation with sepsis, each patient is likely to be at a different stage of sepsis, complicating the interpretation of data. Furthermore, that sample is representative of one particular moment in time, whereas changes in the genomic response to infection of a patient are ongoing. This concept was highlighted by two studies of children with sepsis, the first of which demonstrated significant variability in gene expression at different time points during the evolution of sepsis secondary to meningococcaemia110. The second study demonstrated that about one-third of children with septic shock change endotype over the first 3 days of admission34. As a result, the utilization of gene expression technology in sepsis will likely require sampling at various time points as a patient\u2019s sepsis molecular signature on day 1 may not be the same as on day 3, a requirement that again highlights the importance of having rapid and cost-effective assays available for clinical use to enable serial measurements. Understanding of the importance of these temporal changes also led to the development of statistical methods to analyse gene expression data over time111\u2013114, as well as the utilization of dynamic mathematical models of critical illness115,116. The Society for Complexity in Acute Illness was formed in 2004 in response to a growing understanding of the dynamic nature of critical illness and the need to develop strategies that enable modelling of changes over time to predict patient trajectories116. Although the specifics of these models are outside the scope of this review, this group has provided consensus guidelines for the use of dynamic mathematical modelling for biomedical research116. In particular, mechanistic modelling of sepsis molecular signatures might provide an avenue for overcoming the current technological limitations of single time point gene expression approaches (that is, failure to capture dynamic changes of gene expression) alluded to above115. Similar to the need for rapid assay development, the evolution of these modelling technologies for real-time interpretation and prediction of changes will be important for the advancement of precision medicine in sepsis.",

Although several investigators have successfully utilized leukocyte-derived mRNA and a discovery-based approach to subgroup patients on the basis of biological similarities, the implementation of these prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies at the bedside of patients is limited by several important factors. Further progress is contingent on collaborations between investigators to facilitate a consensus sepsis subclassification, which would enable the large-scale standardization of research efforts. Collaborations with industry are also required to develop technology that is both cost-effective and rapid enough to make its utilization clinically feasible at the bedside of a critically ill patient. Finally, more longitudinal studies of the molecular changes seen over time in sepsis, and how those changes might impact patient outcomes and response to therapies, are required to inform clinicians on when and how to test patients for the purposes of enrichment.
