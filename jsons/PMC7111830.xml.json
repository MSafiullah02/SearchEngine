Clinical signs range from mild, mucous diarrhoea and unaltered general condition to severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea with a mortality rate of 50\u201390% (Moreng et al., 1980, Raynaud et al., 1980, Whipp et al., 1979). The lesions are confined to the large intestine and vary from mild catarrh to marked inflammation with excessive mucus production, necrosis, haemorrhages and pseudomembranes. Microscopically, hyperplastic mucus-filled crypts, goblet cell hyperplasia, and mucosal oedema with congested blood vessels are frequently seen (Albassam et al., 1985, Glock and Harris, 1972, Kinyon et al., 1977). In progressive cases, superficial erosion and mucofibrinous exudate with neutrophils and debris develop (Albassam et al., 1985, Glock and Harris, 1972). Initially, the local inflammatory cell response is minimal, but within a few days a mixed population of inflammatory cells appears in the superficial lamina propria. Spirochaetes are sometimes seen lying free in the cytoplasm of goblet cells and enterocytes (Albassam et al., 1985).",

Concomitant synergistic infection with certain gut bacteria seems to be important but their role is not clear (Harris et al., 1978, Meyer et al., 1975). Opportunists might also exacerbate the lesions (Albassam et al., 1985, Lysons et al., 1984). Further, the importance and precise role of virulence factors such as chemotaxis, attachment, invasion, endotoxins or toxin production remains to be elucidated (ter Huurne and Gaastra, 1995). The bacterium is suggested to primarily invade the goblet cells, thereby causing excessive mucus secretion (Pohlenz et al., 1983). Alternatively, invasion is preceded by initial damage to tight junctions (Kang and Olander, 1990, ter Huurne and Gaastra, 1995). In addition, the host\u2019s immune response might exacerbate the lesions (Hontecillas et al., 2005, Nuessen et al., 1983).",

(1983) reported a weak cellular response consisting of a few eosinophils and neutrophils together with oedema, and an increase in lymphocytes, macrophages and mast cells in response to necrosis. Meyer et al., 1975, Pohlenz et al., 1984 suggested that neutrophil infiltration occurred in response to secondary infections. However, the specific T cell immune response appears to be important (Galvin et al., 1997, Jonasson et al., 2003, Waters et al., 1999, Waters et al., 2000b). In the systemic immune response, a switch between different T cell subpopulations in response to experimental inoculation has been reported (Jonasson et al., 2003, Waters et al., 1999, Waters et al., 2000a). Further, a depletion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from the epithelial layer and an aggregation of CD4+ T cells in lamina propria have been described (Hontecillas et al., 2005).",

During the inoculation period, B. hyodysenteriae was isolated in faeces from one pig. In other animals, the first isolation was 5\u201315 days after challenge. In six animals, the shedding ceased when the animals were recovering clinically and the consistency of the faeces started to increase.

Before inoculation, the mucosa was smooth with a pale pink colour and distinct vessels (Fig. 2\na). A similar picture was seen on all occasions in the cannulated non-inoculated animals. The macroscopic lesions seen by endoscopy generally normalised within a week. The following alterations were observed: when diarrhoea was first observed, the mucosa was reddish and with a glistening, rough and perturbed appearance, the vessels were indistinct or invisible, and increased mucus with flecks of a yellowish fibrin-like material dispersed over the mucosa were seen (Fig. 2b). Two days later, at the second day of haemorrhagic diarrhoea, a similar but aggravated picture was present with more prominent yellowish flecks and scattered haemorrhagic areas (Fig. 2c). Increased haemorrhage was noted at the biopsy sites. On the fifth day of clinical disease, the mucosa was still red and glistening, but areas with a smooth appearance and distinct vessels were seen alternating with flecks of yellowish material and dark, brownish-red demarcated spots (Fig. 2d). In two pigs examined on the seventh day, the mucosa appeared normal. In one pig, an excessive amount of mucus was present at the first endoscopy and before onset of haemorrhagic diarrhoea (Fig. 2e). This was also the case in the inoculated pig not developing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Two days later, the intestine was covered with confluent areas of mucus and yellowish material (Fig. 2f). On the fifth day, mucus and yellowish material were less abundant and the underlying mucosa had a pale pink colour.",

The maximum crypt length in the different biopsy specimens was 330\u2013440 \u03bcm (mean 369 \u03bcm).A marked predomination of goblet cells containing acid, neutral or mixed mucins were noted in the epithelium throughout the crypts. Crypt lumina were generally not, or only slightly, dilated by mucus (Fig. 3\na\u2013b). The cellularity of lamina propria mainly included lymphocytes and plasma cells, admixed with macrophages. In about 30% of the biopsies from all but one pig, minimal to mild multifocal infiltrates of neutrophils were recorded in the crypt epithelium or the lamina propria. No consistent morphological variation related to biopsy sites or sampling occasion was noted.II.\nPigs inoculated with B. hyodysenteriae\nHistological findings are summarised in Table 2\n. Generally, the overall cellularity of the lamina propria did not increase, as compared to the non-inoculated pigs. Except in one pig where the maximum crypt length had not increased at the first endoscopy p.i. (Fig. 3c, d), crypt hyperplasia was evident on all occasions after onset of diarrhoea, and from the maximal crypt length recorded in individual pigs (Fig. 3e\u2013g) it seemed that crypt hyperplasia were more marked after a few days of diarrhoea. A marked depletion of goblet cell mucins at the crypt base was noted especially during the first 3 days and did sometimes involve the major length of the crypts (Fig. 3f, g). This was often associated with prominent accumulates of mucins in dilated crypt lumina (Fig. 3f) and on the mucosal surface. Goblet cell hyperplasia, i.e. hyperplastic crypts with almost complete predominance of crowded and intact goblet cells, was seen only in biopsies from the fifth day. The surface epithelium was often pleomorphic and markedly attenuated (Fig. 3e). Shallow mucosal erosions with sero- and fibrinocellular to haemorrhagic exudates were frequently observed on the first and second biopsy occasions and were abundant in some biopsies (Fig. 3h). Mild infiltrates of neutrophils were seen at least once in all pigs. In three pigs at the first and in one pig at the third sampling, marked neutrophil infiltration occurred in the superficial lamina propria, sometimes adjacent to erosions. Large pools of mucopurulent and fibrinocellular to fibrinonecrotic exudate often occurred on the mucosal surface, especially at 1\u20133 days after onset of diarrhoea. Warthin Starry staining revealed foci of numerous coiled spirochetes on the mucosal surface.\n",

Further, the systemic immune response was newly activated. After 1 day, the disease usually aggravated to haemorrhagic diarrhoea with slightly depressed general condition. On the third day, the mucosa was covered by granular yellow debris and haemorrhagic areas with erosions were frequently seen. The crypt length had increased and the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes still decreased. Systemically, an increase in numbers of monocytes and acute phase proteins was noted. Five days after the development of clinical signs, the pigs started to recover; the lesions in the intestine were demarcated and interspersed among areas of apparently normal mucosa. On histology, crypt hyperplasia was still evident and goblet cells in the lower part of the crypts were depleted of mucus.

The lesions in pigs with a moderately to severely depressed condition did not differ macroscopically from lesions in pigs with slightly depressed general behaviour. When viewed by light microscopy, the lesions have been reported to progress from catarrhal to fibrinonecrotic enteritis as the disease progresses (Glock et al., 1974). Others report that the severity of the lesions does not increase with duration of the disease (Wilcock and Olander, 1979). Crypt hyperplasia is a consistent feature of the disease (Glock et al., 1974, Wilcock and Olander, 1979). In the present study, it seemed that crypt hyperplasia was more marked after a few days of diarrhoea and goblet cell hyperplasia became prominent on the fifth and seventh day after the development of diarrhoea. Crypt elongation has been reported to be caused by increased regeneration of cells in areas with surface necrosis (Wilcock and Olander, 1979). However, in the present study crypt hyperplasia was found independently of erosions, as also reported by Jensen et al. (1998). Among infected pigs, the crypt length found at necropsy was generally increased, as compared to the length measured in the biopsies. The significance of this is unclear but may be caused by mucosal contraction when the biopsy was gripped (van der Gaag and Happ\u00e9, 1990). Some authors have suggested that the disease begins with acute necrosis of the surface epithelium induced by toxin production (Albassam et al., 1985, Hughes et al., 1975). However, mucosal erosions were not a consistent feature in the biopsies of the early diarrhoeic phase in the present study. The depletion of mucus from the goblet cells in the basal part of the crypts is commonly reported (Lysons et al., 1984, Pohlenz et al., 1983, Wilcock and Olander, 1979), however, it is unclear whether this results from an increased expulsion of mucus or by diminished mucigen formation in immature proliferating goblet cells (Wilcock and Olander, 1979). Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion was prominent in later stages, as also reported by Lysons et al. (1984) but in contrast to Glock et al. (1974), who regarded this as pronounced feature of the early course of the disease. In the present study, the overall cellularity of the lamina propria did not appear to be altered. This is consistent with Hughes et al., 1975, Albassam et al., 1985, who reported that the initial local inflammatory cell response was minor but that numerous macrophages and neutrophils were present in response to necrosis in later stages.",

In the present study, SAA peaked on the second to fourth day after the beginning of diarrhoea, whereas haptoglobin peaked on the third to fifth day (Fig. 1). In previous studies, SAA peaked the first day and haptoglobin the second day after surgery (Jacobson et al., 2001). Taken together, this suggests that the acute phase response to swine dysentery was induced in response to intestinal lesions. The pig that never developed haemorrhagic diarrhoea had histological mucosal erosions in the first and second endoscopy during overt disease and concomitantly increased levels of SAA and haptoglobin (data not shown).",

In addition, the increase of the two proteins was not always correlated. However, ceasing to eat was associated with very high levels of one or both of the acute phase proteins studied (SAA > 5000 mg/L and haptoglobin 12.1 g/L, respectively). Thus, there seems to be an individual variation in the magnitude of the response, probably related to various expressions of the cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 that are main inducers of haptoglobin and SAA (Jacobson et al., 2004, Mackiewicz et al., 1991, Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999). These cytokines are referred to as endogenous pyrogens and act on the temperature-regulating centre in hypothalamus (Mims et al., 2001). Thus, an elevated body temperature might be expected. Hughes et al. (1975) reported an increase of body temperature of 1.1\u20131.7 \u00b0C during experimentally induced dysentery. However, except for one pig with a peak haptoglobin of 9.1 g/L correlated to a body temperature of 40.6 \u00b0C, no increase in body temperature was recorded in the present study. Thus, fever does not seem to be a prominent feature of swine dysentery.",

Possibly, alterations in the intestinal environment caused by dietary changes such as inclusion of large quantities of soybean meal might produce favourable conditions for the bacteria, allowing it to multiply and induce clinical signs of disease. Alternatively, an imbalance in the intestinal eco-system causes the expulsion of the bacteria allowing it to be detected in the faeces.",
