The idea of direct communication over electric wire eventually arrived with Morse's telegraph in 1838. However, even when Bell finally invented the electric-speaking telephone in 1876, it still took some time to find a common use for the device. Even though its invention had been anticipated for a long time, it arrived without a clear and agreed purpose, and was received simply as a curiosity (Young, 1991: VIII, 1-2) . The inventors had great difficulties finding a buyer for the patent (Aronson, 1977: 15) .",

Even after allowing for the differences of social contexts and technical devices, the knowledge of early practices, conflicts, fears and hopes about telephones will nevertheless improve the understanding of the uses and social roles of mobile telephones. The interest of the comparison is to give an insight into what happens when new services and new devices enter a marketplace. The evolution of fixed-line telephones, people's practices and meanings, and the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of the industry can provide valuable information concerning the evolution of mobile telephones and the launch of new services. This contradicts the common view in the information and communication technologies industry, that the future is not built by looking at the past. But this chapter tries to show that, according to other well-known adage, if one ignores the past one is condemned to repeat it.",

In the early days of the landline telephone media showed the same lack of interest. The period of controversies, polemics and astonishment after the invention of the telephone in 1876 was shorter than for other devices, such as the radio. This silence and absence of public debate reflects the quick adoption of the telephone as a taken for granted element of everyday middle-class life in the countries where it was first introduced. When the sociological studies about technical inventions arose in the 1930s at the University of Chicago, under the influence of William F. Ogburn, the telephone was already an old communication technology, lacking the excitement of radio and cinema.",

As with the old phones, the speed of acceptance and \"naturalisation\" of mobiles are the reasons given for this lack of interest. Radio and cinema yesterday, and the Internet today are more spectacular and exciting subjects for scholars. Mobile phones are also elusive to conceptualise. Although an example of new media, they have the transparency of the fixed phones, in that as conveyors of speech their mediation is forgotten. It is necessary to find concepts to apprehend mobile phones and able to understand a technology that connects local (conversations) and global (network, satellites and transmission points), which is a point of contact between different domains (public and private, work and home). A \"theoretical mobility\" is required to study this assemblage of people and technology forming a network, a shared agency that enables actions at distance (Cooper, 2001: 29) .",

The history of the social role of the telephone is less the technical evolution of the telephone system than a series of arenas for negotiating issues crucial to the conduct of social life: who is outside and inside, who may speak and who may not, who has the authority and may be believed (Marvin, 1988: 3) . The adoption by society of new technological devices is a relationship of mutual shaping, where technology accommodates, but also transforms, existing social practices. The telephone use, like the uses of other technological objects, is a constructed complex of habits, beliefs and procedures embedded in elaborate cultural codes of communication. The uses are a distribution of competences and performances between people and devices, the result of how people project their respective social worlds onto technologies and what their justifications and fears are.",

This use as a means of entertainment and broadcasting of news was one of the main uses of the device until the end of the 19th century. The broadcasting of news was both professional and improvised. In the first case, the content was provided by the phone companies or other private broadcasters; in the second, the content was self-created by the users. The telephone companies broadcasted news, concerts, weather reports and even informed their subscribers of the entry of the USA into the war against Spain in Cuba in 1898. This was a supplementary service offered to their subscribers in order to make the device more attractive, which presents many similarities with the alerts received by mobile phones nowadays.",

In the USA a similar example was the Telephone Herald of Newark (Marvin, 1988: 228-230) . Like ancestors of the radio, they broadcast a whole range of news, lectures, theatre and music. The diffusion of news and gossip was also improvised through party lines. These were collective lines shared by a several homes. People who shared the same line exchanged and asked for news, or maybe more often just eavesdropped in order to be up to date with the current issues (Marvin, 1988: 222) . The use of telephone as an entertainment form also involved teleconferences for clubs and associations. The telephone as a broadcasting medium coexisted with its use as a conversational instrument from the 1880s, but progressively disappeared before the invention of the radio and therefore did not compete with this new medium (Burrows, 1924) . The audiences attracted by most of the commercial efforts to broadcast through the telephone were very small. They were the early adopters, mostly from the upper classes, and the content of the programmes transmitted reflected their tastes and interests. Nowadays, the multimedia possibilities of Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and History Repeating?

            "text": "The telephone descended from a \"parent\" technology, the telegraph. Hence initially the people involved in supplying it and the marketing policies they used were the same. This inheritance shaped its early history. The first use as a conversational device was as a substitute for private telegraph lines, operating just between two fixed points, usually the home and the business place. Telephone went from the one-way process of the broadcasting use to a restricted one-to-one dialogue. It started as an expensive device favoured by the upper classes, as is often the case with new technologies, and then grew popular with farmers in the USA and urban middle classes. For the first decades of its existence, use of the telephone was a businessmen's monopoly. It substituted for the telegraph in the commercial and professional communities. From the beginning, the marketing campaigns were aimed at educating the public. They try to suggest purposes, instruct people on how to use the telephone, provide new etiquette rules and nurture goodwill to the industry. The industry men of the early days had a misperception of telephone users (Fischer, 1992: 60, 62, 78, 85) . The late introduction of sociability as a marketing point does not mean that it did not exist before. It is, rather, that the experts, the industry men, considered these uses inappropriate. Fischer (1992: 81) explains this fact in relation to the inheritance from the telegraph. Those former telegraph men considered the use for social conversation an abuse or a trivialisation of the service. It was considered \"chit-chat\" and \"idle gossip\". Inside and outside the industry, many people considered Lessons from the Past 32 idle conversations an inappropriate invasion of the household. There were also worries about inappropriate contacts between men and women of different classes and about the loss of privacy. The dismissing of women as incompetent users was also extended to black people, immigrants and farmers. These considerations, expressed for example in technical journals and the electrical press, as Marvin (1988: 17-32) shows, are part of the invention of the expert and the stigmatisation of lay people. They did not derive from the use of the device, but from the existing relationships and perceptions of the different social groups. They distinguish the outsiders and the insiders of the technological world. In the case of mobile phones, the invisibility of teenagers and youngsters, and the consequent surprise when they became active users that helped to make Short Messaging Service (SMS) popular, is a similar phenomenon. Paradoxically, the focus on teenagers' uses afterwards, in social research and in the media too, does not take into account that adults also share some of these uses, and that other age groups, such as elderly people, are also adopting the device and changing their patterns of usage with the time. These examples of distorted perception of the uses of a technological device, by those who produce it, prove that the promoters of a technology do not necessarily know or decide its final uses. Consumers develop new uses and ultimately decide which will predominate. These vendors and marketers are constrained not only by technical and economic attributes, but also by an interpretation of its uses that is shaped by their histories. The industry men are as deeply involved in the realm of cultural production as in the technical one.",

They had to distinguish themselves from mechanics and tinkerers, and from the enthusiastic but electrically illiterate public, by elevating the theoretical over the practical, the textual over the manual and science over craft (Marvin, 1988: 61) . One of the surprising consequences is that the industry men did not consider the telephone a product for mass distribution during at least the first 50 years of its existence.",

            "text": "Looking at the American case, as Fischer describes it, it is highly remarkable that income determined whether the urban American subscribed to telephone as strongly at the beginning as 40 years later. The stagnation of the diffusion of the telephone down the class system contrasts with that of the automobile. Not only were phones a less exciting purchase, they were also much less cost effective. This stagnation seems to be attributable to the scepticism of the industry about farmers, working class, ethnic minorities and migrants. The attitude of the industry was not only reflected in the marketing strategies, but also in the quality of the service provided and in the accessibility. Rural areas, the Southern states, were long forgotten in the building of new wire systems and exchanges. However, even if the telephone was targeted at the urban North originally, telephones diffused most rapidly in the Midwest and West. Farmers were more likely to subscribe than citydwellers, at least in the first two decades of the century. The reason for the American farmers' interest in the new device was their isolation. However, many subsequently gave up their telephones. The explanation provided by Fischer is that other technologies, such as the automobile, better fulfilled their needs to break their isolation, due to the poor telephone service they were offered. Although the industry was not effective in creating needs and shaping use, it did set the structure within which consumers could exercise choice. As one of the Bell Canada managers quoted by Fischer said in 1902: \"Of the 60,000 people in the city not more than 1,200 have or require telephones \u2026 Telephone service is not universal in its character and should not be supported by tax money\". This claim reveals Bell leaders' sincere conviction throughout the era from the telephone's invention to 1940 that the telephone was not for the masses (Fischer, 1992: 107-108, 120) .",

Being an element of social distinction in the early days explains the opposition, not only by the experts but also by the first subscribers, against a mass diffusion of the phone and the expansion of public phones (Marvin, 1988: 102) . New technological devices often accomplish this function of social distinction. The same happened with mobile phones. In the 1980s and early 1990s, European and American mobile phone companies followed the same strategy as the fixed telephone companies in their early days: high prices, exclusive use and avoidance of mass market. In the Scandinavian countries, however, the marketing strategies targeted both the business market and the mass market. The distinctive, yuppie image was a nuisance to avoid as much as possible, because it gave the product a bad press. This use was perceived as a way of showing off. Advertising campaigns tried to counter this perceived relationship between the device and this use in order that people, who did not want to be identified as yuppies, were not ashamed of using and purchasing a mobile phone (Roos, 1993: 10, 12) .",

            "text": "The passage to a mass market for mobile phones was faster than for fixed lines, but the history of its development was not. According to Barry Brown, it is almost the history of a non-development (Brown, 2001: 7-10) . The first commercial systems were up and running in the 1940s, but it took 30 years to acquire a mass market. It was delayed by decisions to favour other technologies. The first prototypes were fairly crude technologies. The system suffered from a chronic lack of capacity. The frequencies used by a call could not be reused. They were blocked by one call for as far as the radio transmissions were received. The lack of frequency, not the lack of interest by the public, prevented the early mobile phones system from becoming massmarket devices. In 1976 there were 44,000 people with mobile phones in the USA, and 20,000 individuals on a waiting list of 5-10 years time. Nevertheless, the capacity problem had already been solved in 1947, by splitting the coverage area into individual cells, and the technological challenges arising from this procedure were solved by the late 1960s. However, mobile telephony was delayed throughout the 1970s. Regulatory and business decisions made by governments and by the telephone companies explain this delay. Authorities hesitated to allocate spectrum for the telephone system over the frequency required for new TV channels. Companies interested in the development of mobile telephony were involved in legal disputes with American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T). Therefore, the first mass market for a commercial cellular phones system in the USA only started in 1983, 37 years after the first carphone service. This development was not much quicker in other countries without those regulatory constraints, such as the Scandinavian countries, where mobile phones were launched in 1981. Scientists and engineers were also not really interested in this technology, in contrast with the interest in the development of videophones in the 1960s and 1970s, despite the adverse results of market trials. The scientific preferences for one type of technology and the disdain for others, the strange attraction despite commercial failures, is called by Brown a form of pathology in the mind of technological developers (Brown, 2001: 9) . It will be interesting to see in the coming years if the comeback in new mobile phones of the old idea of a videophone becomes a successful application or receives the same cold reception from most people, who dislike the idea of having to worry about their physical appearance and their surroundings when they are making a phone call.",

Similar reticence has also been shown towards mobile phones. In an interview with a French mobile user in March 2004, part of a comparative cross-national study included in the Vodafone Surrey Scholar project, the informant told how once his motorcycle broke down in the middle of the motorway. When he phoned the road police to ask for help and to give them his location, he was asked to walk towards the nearest emergency phone, placed by the road milestones.

Etiquette on the phone was also a concern for the industry men. Phone conversations revealed, in the early days, a relaxation in the common courtesy of speech, which was a class-based reference. The recommended good manners were those of middle-class intimacy: quiet voices, clearly enunciated words and dignified presentation. The importance and the anxieties about how to speak properly on the phone and what community of speakers was addressed in the reach of its wires can be seen in the example of the Ohio telephone company, quoted by Marvin (1988: 89) , which removed the telephones from subscribers who used improper or vulgar language. Mobile phone operators have also published etiquette guides of mobile phone uses, trying without much success to influence users' practices.",

It creates productive traffic (Cherry, 1977: 114) , increases productivity by cutting the costs of acquiring information and co-ordinating schedules, and facilitates the control of the organisation resources, including the personnel ones. The telephone is a key element in the building of corporate empires. Apart from easing the violation of laws and the realisation of exchanges without leaving traces (Aronson, 1977: 32) , phone communication facilitates the physical separation of the offices from the factories, allowing the managers to keep control of the production. Therefore, the telephone plays a role in the urban concentration of financial and business activities (Gottmann, 1977) .

In our society the notion that individuals should be available and accountable to others, visibly and transparently at any time and place, becomes normal (Green, 2001: 33) . The question \"where are you?\" (Laurier, 2001b) asked in mobile phone conversations is a form of establishing mutual contexts for communication, and enables shared circumstances between people communicating at a distance and a relation of mutual accountability and trust. Accountability is a feature common to co-present social relationships and to those established via mobile phones. Different technical systems (Internet and e-mail) allow people to communicate and to be monitored as well as information to be gathered by commercial institutions. Mobile phones are an example of this convergence of communication and information in the same device. Laurier (2001a: 46-61) describes other ways of avoiding the undesirable consequences of the permanent accessibility provided by mobile phones in the case of mobile workers using call screening and voice mail. Mobile workers face a combination of two realities: the need to harmonise among multiple flows of activity and the interplay of planned and improvised action (Sherry, 2001: 112) . They suffer the tension of the \"anytime, anywhere\" possibilities of communication of the ubiquitous mobile phone. The potential disruptions of the constant availability make it necessary to have a way of controlling the access. Mobile technologies of connectivity, like mobile phones, produce tensions in bringing together what is present and what is not. The voice mail service is a form of call storage, which is translated in return calls. In the case of the mobile worker studied by Laurier, the recorded calls are transformed into \"Post-it\" notes, emotional clues for the day ahead and requests to be noted and ignored. This service offers the possibility of responsiveness, without being drawn into the particular \"concertedness\" of phone conversations in \"real time\". It allows people's time space to be extended, orienting them towards distant and non-immediate requests and responses. Call screening is a finely crafted skill among mobile workers. It becomes even a mark of business credibility. \"Everyone is busy call screening everyone else. If they do not, then Sylvia (the mobile worker studied by Laurier) wonders what is wrong with their business!\" (Laurier, 2001a: 54) . Churchill and Wakeford (2001: 174) understand mobility in the case of mobile workers as a continuum from tight mobility to loose mobility. This mobility is the experience of needing real-time synchrony while on the move, maintained throughout ongoing negotiations in established relationships where location information is easily shared or predicted. This is highly collaborative. Loose mobility concerns the requirement of accessing documents or information on the move, asynchronously and without requiring input at such detailed level. It is also highly co-operative, but not collaborative at a detailed level.",

Mobile phones provide a site of negotiation for monitoring, regulation and mutual accountability. Teenagers are aware of the importance of mobile phones with regard to safety and emergency situations. But they also avoid parents' monitoring by not answering the phone or not telling the truth (Green, 2001: 38-39; Ling, 2001) . Social normalisation of monitoring practices at the level of everyday life in public and domestic settings means that individuals can use their mobile phones to assist their own surveillance by institutions, as well as resisting it. At the same time, they also engage in routine monitoring of themselves and each other through that same technology, and assume that others are self-regulating and accountable for their use of the devices in both co-present and telepresent contexts (Green, 2001: 43-44) (Table 2. 3).",

Those demonstrations involved the broadcasting of music, theatre and information. In 1877 an event at the Sunday School of Old John St. M.E. Church included recitations, singing and an exhibition of \"Dr. Bell's Speaking and Singing Telephone\". When an audience of bishops and priests in Quebec City in 1877 heard a voice singing: \"Thou are so near and yet so far,\" they stood up and sang back into the telephone. These stunts created considerable publicity as newspapers relayed them around the world. Mobile phones also have the playful aspect of the early days of the fixed telephone. Their meaning is not only practical and useful, but also affective and entertaining. Affective aspects of mobile phones uses go beyond their playfulness and have been studied by several authors (Fracchiolla, 2001; Beckers et al., 2002; Lobet-Maris and Henin, 2002; Rivi\u00e8re, 2002; Ellwood-Clayton, 2003; Harper, 2003; Jaur\u00e9guiberry, 2003; Lasen, 2003b Lasen, , 2004 Vincent, 2003; . Mobile phones facilitate creative expression, especially in the case of SMS and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). They are a kind of toy and tool for play, with games, animations, pictures, smileys, ring tones and MP3. According to Kopomaa (2000: 70-71) , the spread of technologies goes from novelty to invisibility, but in contradiction to this stage of \"sobering up\", the playful attitude towards mobile phones is likely to survive into the future. The advertising of picture phones and the marketing of 3G highlight the fun and entertaining aspects. Findings of a comparative study in London, Paris and Madrid in 2004 show that a category of pictures taken with camera phones are the result of playing with the phone in a way they would not do with a usual camera: taking snapshots without seeing what is being taken, like holding the phone out of the car window and shooting, taking pictures of strangers on the bus. This adds a thrill, an emotional intensity, to the boring routines of daily commuting. Other instances observed in that study that reveal a playful use of the device are taking pictures of friends just to have a laugh, sending jokes by SMS or teasing with SMS and MMS. Other entertaining practices are facilitated by other applications, such as being able to listen to the radio or downloaded tunes. In one instance observed in London on a rainy afternoon, a couple of teenagers were playing the same beat with their phones, whereas a third friend was rapping some lyrics.",

The fear of health risks derived from telephone use also arose in the early days of its development. Even \"strongminded and able-bodied men\" were considered to be susceptible because of the \"almost constant strain of the auditory apparatus\" in people who used the telephone frequently. Fears of changes introduced by this new technology in people's life were manifested in the belief that the telephone could be a source of bodily distress and unbalance. The body is the first frame to make sense of new experiences. The body is the centre of human experience and the most familiar of the communication modes. It constitutes the touchstone to gauge, explore and interpret the unfamiliar, the critical juncture between nature and culture. Mobile phones affect people's bodies and extend their world. Through our bodies we learn and become sensitive to what the world is made of, thus the body can be defined as learning to be affected (Latour, 2004) . The more our body is affected, the more aspects it becomes aware of, and therefore the larger and more complex our world becomes. Mobile phones affect the way people talk and write, move and gesticulate, feel, walk and look or ignore their surroundings.",

In those days people also feared the contagion of infectious diseases, either by the wires carrying virus, germs and bacteria or by using the same device as sick people. For example, in 1885 rumours spread in Montreal about an epidemic of smallpox being carried by people's breath through the phone (Young, 1991: 34) . Some of the risks considered are the same in both landline and mobile phones; others are different, following the more feared diseases of each period. Also in the case of mobile phones, health fears not only concern the device and its users but also the phone masts and those who live and work near them (Table 2 .5).",

Mobile phone operators were reluctant to launch \"Pay As You Go\" cards as they feared such cards would be mainly used for criminal purposes. And it is true that mobile phones have became indispensable working tools for flexible mobile workers, such as drug dealers, who require to be contacted anywhere, anytime by their customers. Widespread mobile phone theft and the aggression that is often involved in the stealing of phones is another link between phones and crime, particularly youth crime, which make the owners of mobile phones more vulnerable. This also affects the way people use their phones. Many users avoid phoning in public places where they think there is a risk of theft (Lasen, 2003a) . This fear is also related to the \"value paradox\" of mobile phones (Vincent, 2003) . As people become more attached and dependent on their mobile phone and feel that they cannot live without it and all that it contains (phone numbers, messages and the potential of the relationships that mobile phones allow), its value is so great that they do not take it out or use it in certain places for fear of losing it.",

Worries about eavesdropping were present since the beginning of the spread of the telephone, but so was the interest in doing it. Many of the first telephone lines used in America were collective, called party lines, when a few households shared the same telephone line. Each household had a particular ringing tone so that each would know when the call was for them. Thus, eavesdropping was as easy as it was tempting. The conflicts and quarrels arising from this practice were the reason why the Amish banned the device (Fischer, 1992: 241) . The Amish and the Mennonites argued over whether the telephone was a theologically acceptable device or an intolerable worldly seduction. The Amish ended up banning the telephone due to the conflicts and disputes originated by eavesdropping in the party lines. They thought, \"if that is the way they are going to be used we would better not have them\". Mobile phones are an \"indiscrete technology\" (Cooper, 2001) . It is not that mobile phones facilitate forms of social indiscretion, but they do have the capacity to blur distinctions between ostensibly discrete domains and categories, such as public and private, remote and distant, work and leisure; just as fixed phone did with gender and class boundaries. These categories were already problematic before the appearance of mobile phones. The telephone offers the possibility of mixing heterogeneous social worlds. That is at the same time a useful opportunity and a dreadful threat of intrusion. The phone embedded the social risk of permitting outsiders to cross boundaries of race, gender and class without penalty. Nowadays, the worries concerning paedophiles and the growing concern about the protection of childhood also add the age boundary between adults and children. 3G will extend to mobile telephones the existent worries about the access to children to and through the Internet. Phones altered the customary orders of secrecy and publicity, as well as the customary proprieties of address and interaction. Well-insulated communities of pre-telephone days could not remain forever untouched by these developments, nor were telephone companies able to ensure that emerging telephone communities would remain within the limits of social decorum and work-related use (Marvin, 1988: 107) . For instance, fixed-line and mobile phones facilitate courtship beyond parental control (Ellwood-Clayton, 2003) and promote infidelity but also helped to track down the adulterous. The most disturbing assault in social distance exploited telephone anonymity, abusive and obscene calls having existed since the early times (Marvin, 1988: 88; Katz, 1999: 231-278) . Nowadays, SMS serves this purpose being a way of bullying and spreading rumours and reputations among teenagers. The spreading of rumours through SMS goes beyond teenagers' sociality. One of the consequences of the Chinese official \"economy with the truth\" about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the spreading of rumour about hundreds of new cases through SMS.",

Such a statement has to be contrasted with empirical observation. Patterns of social interaction among strangers are different in different cultures. Londoners, for instance, did not wait for mobile phones to stop talking to strangers in trains or at bus stops. On the other hand, in southern countries, where one can talk to a stranger without being considered potentially mad or dangerous, and where the rules of civil inattention in public places never really ruled, this communication pattern seems to prevail despite the success of mobile phones. Civil inattention is a concept coined by Goffman, which refers to the ways in which people in public places show awareness of other people's presence without making them the object of particular attention.

This view seems to forget that private conversations have always taken place in public, and that public and private activities and exchanges can take place either in public or in private spaces. Friends and relatives chatting in a train do not only discuss weather or politics, and lovers kiss on park benches. Home can be the place for work or for having an anti-globalisation meeting. Subjective experience of the urban space does not mean its privatisation. The idea of Richard Sennet (1986) that dealing with private and intimate matters in a public milieu is a sign of an uncivilised society is not only very debatable, but also an outrageously Anglo-Saxon, self-centred statement. Mobile phones are indiscreet because their use blurs the boundaries between social spaces, like private and public. The coexistence of and potential friction between public and private are now material and observable phenomena. At the same time these uses reveal the limits of this separation. The use of mobile phones is sometimes considered an intrusion of the private world into the public sphere, and also as a resource for achieving privacy inside the home for the different members of the household, as in the case of the teenagers at home, or when one member of the household wants to have a secret conversation.",

A specific feature of mobile phones is to facilitate more communication in transitional work settings, like hallways and lobbies, and in \"dead\" times. They are also employed to make communication in mixed-use settings, like cars or restaurants. The authors reveal the resulting paradox: in previous era increased mobility led to an increasing separation of work and personal place and life, but wireless technologies may be changing that.",

Urban public spaces have a soundscape made of different sounds and noises, among them mobile phone rings. In a space beyond our control, we certainly tend to create our own space. But personal space does not equal private space. The use and enjoyment of those spaces are not correlated with any supposed right not to be interrupted. The experience of strolling in urban spaces shows the opposite indeed. Different images and information constantly interrupt us. Moreover, the subjective daydreaming and reflections of strollers and commuters should not be systematically considered private thoughts. The French expression, fl\u00e2neurie, this way of idle strolling and daydreaming, which involves the observation of people and social types and contexts, is a way of reading the city, its populations and its spatial configurations around the issues of the fragmentation of experience. The peculiar aspect of the fl\u00e2neur's way of strolling, as described by Baudelaire and Benjamin (Benjamin, 1973) , is the gaze, the joy of looking. He observes, watches, perceives, classifies and daydreams. This is a way of resisting the indifference towards the distinction between things, typical of denizens of big cities. The interruptions and disruption of the street world are the fodder of this particular type of pedestrian.",

This is a time where all moments are equivalent and measurable, where one can be synchronous to any others regardless of the place, the hour and the activity. The use of mobile phones is an example of how the discipline based on the time organisation and on the strict planning of different activities is replaced by continuous accessibility (Ling, 2004: Chapter 4) . The phone call is an advance arrangement, anticipates future meetings and prepares concrete proposals. The systematic use of time is replaced by systematic accessibility. Mobile phones permit an increased temporal efficiency by flexibility in the use of time. They allow the postponing and rearrangement of schedules, meetings and appointments. Nothing has to be agreed in precise terms any more. The conception and experience of a rhythmic time open to last minute changes and to continuous rearrangements between different activities, in work or leisure situations, is not originated by the mobile phone (Lasen, 2001) . But the device facilitates their diffusion. The mobile phone makes the clock and the calendar unnecessary. It is a calendar and a clock. It becomes a navigation tool determining the co-ordinates of everyday living. These co-ordinates are colleagues, customers, friends, acquaintances and their schedules or the lack of them. The mobile phone replaces the clock and the calendar as the timekeeper of the linear time concept. However, it is also the tool for a rhythmic, more spontaneous and \"last minute\" time organisation.",

Maintaining personal relations by telephone became in public places common in the middle class and farms of the 1910s and early 1920s. By this time Americans used the phone largely for sociability. This was truer for women than for men, for the younger more than for the older, for the gregarious more than for the shy. The communication modes displaced by the use of the telephone were telegrams and hand-delivered notes. It probably cut down the casual drop-in visits and helped to arrange other meetings (Fischer, 1992: 253) . Instead of competing with other technologies of communication, mobile phones allow different communication patterns (Harper, 2001 ): short messages and short calls, the possibility of transmitting a mood or a particular experience in real time or, in work situations, brief conversations primarily serving the function of making sure both parties agree with some brief discussion of status or progress. The facility to connect and the facility to cut the connection, to screen incoming calls and to shorten conversations, have made digital networks popular and highly used. In mobile phone use the threshold for making contacts become lower; even lower when texting. Mobile phones allow people to do things that are difficult to do when they are face to face, in situations emotionally charged as breaking up or asking out. In these cases technology facilitates the task, enabling people to elude some of the awkward social consequences these situations entail (Harper, 2003) , although, in the case of dumping someone, at the cost of being considered coward, cheap and tactless. This way of avoiding possible face-to-face conflicts by using SMS not only applies to personal communication. In May 2003 the British injury claims firm Accident Group announced to more than 2,000 of its workers that they were going to be sacked by sending texts to their company mobile phones.",

Different kinds of mobility are related to mobile phones; mobility of the user, the device itself and the services that can be accessed from different locations. But since the mid-1990s surveys done in Europe, such as the one quoted in Fortunati (2001) , have shown that there was not a correlation between the mobility of the users and the use of the mobile phone. This is contrary to the opinion that mobile phones are instruments that enhance mobility. The force of attraction of the device was beyond the constraints of mobile work or those of residential mobility. When the device enters the domestic and leisure spheres it changes its identity and loses its connotation of being a mobile technology (Fortunati, 2001: 98) . Some of those convivial uses reveal another kind of mobility, called micromobility by Weilenmann and Larsson (2001) , the way in which an artefact can be mobilised and manipulated for various purposes around a relatively circumscribed, or \"at hand\", domain. Mobile phones are also a tool for local interaction, rather than merely a device for communication with others who are distant. This kind of use can be observed in the way SMS is employed by teenagers (Weilenmann and Larsson, 2001; Taylor and Harper, 2002) .",

While using the mobile phone we are having simultaneously remote and co-present interaction. Using a mobile phone in a public place demands simultaneously handling the voice call and face-to-face interaction. This simultaneity affects the way we behave in front of strangers. The etiquette of phoning, that requires focusing attention on the conversation, can be in conflict with the etiquette of public behaviour. The body language of mobile phone users differs from the usual one of pedestrians. Their faces do not show reserve but reflect the content of the conversation, displaying emotions not usually shown on the street. They avoid eye contact with people around, often ignoring them. Therefore, they fail to produce the deferential glances exchanged between strangers. This conflict of etiquette influences the social acceptability of the mobile phone use in public. The simultaneity of the face-to-face interaction and the phone conversation also affects friends and acquaintances. Findings of a comparative study of mobile phone use in public place in London, Madrid and Paris show that users in different cities find different solutions for this situation (Lasen, 2003a) . For instance, in Madrid they tend to include a third party in the phone conversation. They facilitate a sort of interaction between the phone conversation and the present situation, trying not to render absent those who face them. In Paris and London, however, when the users do not move away from those present, they interrupt the face-to-face interaction by avoiding eye contact, while those who are close pretend not to hear the phone conversation. The use of a mobile while with others can be a cause of annoyance, conflict and arguments if those present feel that the priority is given to the phone conversation. Therefore, restraining the use and shortening the conversations seem to be rules of etiquette in these cases. Being in company is a reason for switching the phone off for Londoners and Parisians. In Madrid the priority seems to be to always be available, therefore users keep their phones on in these occasions.",

The discomfort experienced by some of the users phoning outdoors is not as strong as to let a call go unanswered. Moreover, in the street users do not have to worry about other people overhearing their conversations. It was observed in Paris and London that some urban spaces constitute a kind of temporary phone zone (Lasen, 2003a) . People stop there, make a call and resume walking afterwards. In front of big stores' doors, near underground entrances or on some street corners, one can see this kind of improvised open-air wireless phone booth. In these places several people are phoning, apparently unaware of others doing the same. This behaviour, which could be probably found in other cities, shows how phone users have created a new use for urban spaces. Streets are not only transitional spaces but also a place to stop and talk. The use of mobile phones gives new life and meanings to transitional spaces and times of our everyday life. A phone call turns a \"no place\", like a train station, bus, airport or road, into a third place for chatting and playfulness.",

The conflict of etiquette, the rules of interaction in public places on one side and the rules of mobile phone use on the other is an example of the mutual shaping between society and technology. The use of urban public places influences the use of mobile phones and is changed by them. That is the reason for the disapproval of the users who ignore the presence of others, are too noisy or talk about intimate matters. This is an example of how the rules of interaction in public places are applied to mobile phone use. However, the growing tolerance of this way of using phones and the widespread use of mobile phones in public places -where it was considered unsuitable or even banned, like restaurants, concert halls or cinemas -is proof that the use of a technological device can change the perception and use of public places and the way of behaving in such places.",

The unwritten rules of etiquette are revealed by phone users' non-verbal behaviour (body gestures, gaze and volume of voice) and by the reactions of others, not always silent, to mobile phone use in public places. The conventional patterns of non-vocal communication are \"central to understand how unwritten rules of mobile phone use are constituted as a moment-by-moment emergent social phenomenon\" (Murtagh, 2001) . Mobile phone use also allows the redefinition of codes of human interaction, the renegotiation of norms governing social and emotional relationships, concerning courtesy, reciprocity, accessibility and the display of emotions in public contexts (De Gournay, 2002) . Concerning this last aspect, mobile phones have become the medium for the \"publicisation\" of emotional fulfilment. They announce to our fellow travellers, pedestrian or work colleagues how much we are in demand, how full our life is (ibid.: 200). De Gournay interprets this possibility of renegotiating the norms as an elimination of the criteria for evaluating \"social capital\". Good manners, verbal skills, signs of refinement in dress and level of education, all these elements of social competence are not necessary when interacting from a distance with a mobile phone. By asserting that using a screen or a telephone nobody is required to display the slightest social competence, De Gournay fails to account for rules and etiquette that characterise mobile phone communication, and she reproduces a social fear already present in the early days of the landline telephone (Table 2 .7).",

However, regardless of these views, conversation and sociability were the main uses of the telephone in the early days. Research quoted by Fischer (1992: 230) , carried out in Seattle in 1909, reveals that half of the calls had some social content and 30% were idle gossip, at a time when only about one-third of Seattle households had telephones. Rural people, especially farmers' wives, depended heavily on the telephone for sociability until they had cars. Women called often for social purposes and frequently even for simply \"visiting\", as far as back as the 1910s. Conversation is an important social process, serving to maintain networks and build communities. This aspect was ignored by industry leaders, journalists and other male critics. Time-budgets filled out by suburban New Yorkers before World War II revealed that women spent four times as much time on the telephone as men did. In other parts of the USA, the higher the proportion of adult women in the household, the higher the chances were that it had a telephone. The industry view in the 1920s was that women, acting as \"chief executive officers\" of the household, should telephone to order goods and services. Women's social calls were considered a problem and they initially tried to suppress them. But women cultivated their own purposes. Farmwomen used the phone to sustain social activities and help create community bonds in rural areas; in urban areas, middle and upper class women used the phone for organisational activities, young urban women used it for courting.",

Fischer proposes a few explanations for this gender difference. The isolation of women from adult contact during the day, the fact that married women's duties include the role of social manager (appointments, events, keeping informed about relatives and friends) and that North American women are more comfortable on the telephone because they are generally more sociable than men. So the telephone fits the typical female style of personal interaction more closely than it does for men. From the first decades of the 20th century women used the telephone to pursue what they wanted, conversation, and were responsible for the development of a culture of the telephone as they instigated its use for purposes of sociability.",

Workers are represented as individualist in their use of the technology. They are independent and work alone. The technological devices are not part of a collaborative network of devices and collaborations (Churchill and Wakeford, 2001) . Nevertheless, the use of mobile phones depends on stable social infrastructures. Mobile workers often find themselves in a situation of waiting. This waiting -for events to happen, for flights and trains, for information and business deals or for other people to do things -is a common experience which demonstrates an interconnected network of working relationships, collaborators and the interconnectedness of devices (Churchill and Wakeford, 2001) .

A range of meanings linked to identity, sexuality and desire are attached to mobile phones. Cooper et al. (2000) analyse the role of mobile phones in relation to gay lifestyles. The young men interviewed consider the mobile phone as a means of maintaining real-time contact with significant others, a decisive element of the gay lifestyle. The interest of such statements does not lie in whether they are true or not. On one hand, there is not just one gay lifestyle; on the other, the convivial use of mobile phones to strength friendship bonds and to maintain personal networks is not exclusive to gay men. But the consideration of a common use as a particular and distinctive one, linked to a specific group and lifestyle, demonstrates the importance of mobile phones as personal devices becoming part of one's own personality and of the feeling of belonging to a particular community. A similar example can be found in the importance of mobile phones for clubbers who use the device to prepare the night out, to make arrangements to meet other people and to communicate with those absent from the club (Miles and Moore, 2004) .",

They are tools for collaborative interaction in the local environment. The sharing of mobile phones helps to invigorate and sustain social networks. Weilenmann and Larsson, in their research with Swedish teenagers, identify different forms of sharing, from the \"minimal forms of sharing\" like showing, writing or deciphering SMS, to the \"hands-on ways of sharing\", as when several people take part in a conversation sharing the phone in a kind of multiparty talk. The borrowing and lending of telephones is a mark of trust and friendship also making the mobile phone a collaborative resource. These Swedish teenagers also share mobile phones with unknown people in order to make contact, as when storing your phone number in other's mobile phones. The comparative study of mobile phone use in public places quoted above (Lasen, 2003a) , found that adult users in Madrid also have a collaborative use of the mobile, for instance sharing the phone conversation with those who are face-to-face. Camera phones also facilitate the collective use of the device.

If one believes that we live in individualistic societies, the success of mobile phones can only mean that they are \"perfectly suited to the ideology of an individualistic society\", as Kopomaa asserts, forgetting all the examples he provides in the same book invalidating such a statement. Mobile phones are a tool for networking, for nurturing and maintaining social cohesion of groups, for creating \"nomadic communities\". 3G telephones open this issue of communities and social networks to the virtual communities. Until now those were based on e-mail exchanges and the use of Internet. There is a different perception of telephones and e-mail addresses. 3G will pose the question of the access by strangers to our personal mobile phones.",

People were not uprooted by the new technologies, locating their activities and interests somewhat more often outside the towns, but mostly they expanded their local activities. The telephone cannot be substantially credited or blamed for undermining localism in the early 20th century. As Willey and Rice argued in a monograph published in 1933, people used the telephone to increase local ties much more than extra local ones. Phone calling strengthened localities against homogenising cultural forces, such as movies and radio. It also enabled Americans to participate in activities more frequently and more easily outside their localities. As Fischer affirms, people called relatives long distance, made more trips to tourist spots, and followed their sport teams to more games. Although the balance of change was in the direction of the wider world it was not a weighty shift, not as substantial as the increase in total social activity. Mobile phones serve to increase the communication within a small group of people locally, mostly friends and family, instead of helping to enlarge the circle of friends and acquaintances.",

Keeping in touch with the loved and the familiar allows one to conjugate security and geographical mobility (Cherry, 1977) . The same applies to mobile phones. These characteristics were studied in a particular situation, the sudden deprivation of the telephone. In February 1975, a fire in a switching centre in New York left a 300-block area of Manhattan (around 100,000 customers) without phone service for 33 days. The research carried out afterwards about this period studied the hypothesis of the telephone as a reducer of loneliness and anxiety, a maintainer of the groups' cohesion, or as an intruder in the private sphere. The results showed that there is no satisfactory alternative to the telephone and its essential role in urban lifestyles. These unfortunate New Yorkers felt isolated, uneasy and less in control of their lives. There were not clear compensatory behaviours. The increase in TV and radio consuming or in visiting friends was modest. The incoming calls were missed more than the outgoing. The telephone is an instrument of urban adaptation. It allows an imminent connectedness and an immediate interaction that shapes the symbolic proximity, which counteracts social mobility (Wurtzel and Turner, 1977: 246-261) . The possibility of perpetual contact allowed by mobile phones is so important that the loss of this capability produces strong feelings, such as panic when users lose or forget their phone, or anger against the operator when the network fails. This aspect outlines the importance of the resilience of networks for mobile telephone users. On 20th February 2003 the 8.7 million Vodafone subscribers in Spain could not use their phones because of a breakdown. The journalist who reported the problem in El Pais newspaper described how the subscribers were left \"absolutely cut off for hours, unable to make or receive calls on their mobile phones\". The expression \"absolutely cut off \" can seem exaggerated, as other ways of communication were available. But that was the main feeling of the users, not only those who depend on their phones for work and business but also for those who use them to be in contact with friends and family. These users interviewed on the TV news also felt isolated, uneasy and less in control of their lives, as in the New York case described above. Again, people's main worries were not about outgoing calls, after all there were other ways of making calls, but the loss of the ability to receive calls from the people they know. The company received more than 400,000 complaints and the regional governments of Catalonia and Andalucia threatened to sue the company.",

Participants in a conversation show emotional identification with each other. There is a tacit agreement to help each other along, to accept each other's presentation, because the failure of one produces embarrassment in others. Thus, every conversational move is fraught with emotional potential. Anger, pride, anguish, confidence, embarrassment, guilt and gratitude are potential emotional accompaniments of conversation, no matter what the content is.

Mobile phones also respond to the other need outlined by Bauman, that these bonds should be \"only loosely tied, so that they can be untied again, with little delay, when the settings change\". Mobile phones and their promise of perpetual contact and permanent accessibility provide the assurance of connections, needing to be ceaselessly renewed. But they are also the witness and accountant of this anguishing situation where contacts and relations cannot be taken for granted: \"Why didn't I get any messages today? Why didn't she call me back?\" (Jaur\u00e9guiberry, 2003) .",

            "text": "The history of the introduction of landline telephones reveals that the affordability and the availability of the phone came first to the more affluent households, and much later to the working class ones. The prejudices, narrow-mindedness and will to keep the phone as an elitist product of the early industry men resulted in the slow spread of the telephone. It represented the expansion of a dimension of social life: the realm of frequent checking-in, rapid updates, easy scheduling of appointments and quick exchanges of casual confidences, as well as the sphere of long-distance conversations. The case of the early years of telephone use in the USA did not reveal any clear sequence of dramatic social changes. There were no psychological changes that mirrored the characteristics of telephone. Americans used the telephone to enhance the way of life to which they were already committed. Phones have a particular history, different from other technologies, such as the automobile. This history is also a proof of the users' relative autonomy from the pressure of vendors and from any supposed technological imperative. Such autonomy is never total. It is limited by structures beyond their control, such as income and costs, where companies marketed their services and the role of government (Fischer, 1992: 268, 269) . Mobile phones are the most successful communication devices ever. The commercial launch of the device took a long time from the creation of the first prototypes. The pattern of diffusion followed that of the landline phones, from business and upper classes to a mass market centred on sociability uses. But this was achieved in a much shorter period of time. The reasons for purchasing the device were also the same: work efficiency, security in emergency and sociability. Many of the studies quoted in this chapter concern mobile workers or teenagers, the former in order to analyse the use of mobile phones in a work environment, the latter to consider the creative uses and the importance given to mobile phones in their everyday life. Teenagers, youngsters and young adults have adopted the new device faster and more openly. According to the Eurobarometer survey of 10,000 Europeans between the ages of 15 and 24 carried out in April and May 2001, mobile phones top the list of new technologies used by young people at least once a week (80%), with very little variation between countries. This is far ahead of computers, the Internet and e-mail.",

A certain amount of \"moral panic\" about the effects follows the adoption of new technologies. Some of those fears are similar in both cases: threats to the health, danger of addiction, the decline of traditional interactions, the loss of interest in taking part in social activities or inconsiderate behaviour. Others are new, such as the privatisation of public space, the intrusion of work into the private sphere or the increased possibilities for control. It has been argued above that the relationship of mutual shaping between technology, phones in this case, and social practices produces a more complex outcome than a unilateral growing control and the privatisation of the public space. Mobile phones allow new practices and uses of urban and public places and contribute to exposing the erosion of the division between private and public already existent in contemporary society. Some of the issues described could be useful for further developments in the field of mobile communication devices. One is the conflict between the users' views and the industry men regarding the ownership of the device and the right uses. This conflict between users and producers could be important in the case of 3G mobile phones and the increasing number of partners. Another important teaching from the history of the landline telephone is the power of people to impose their purposes, revealing the illusion of the industry aim to educate the users, even in a constraining context, and how neglected and marginal users find successful uses, unknown or dismissed before by the experts.",

Empirical research about fixed and mobile telephony shows a very different picture. Phone communication contributes to the maintenance of local communities and close groups, and in some cases takes part in the organisation of social movements (Rheingold, 2002) , such as those in Philippines and South Korea, public and politic actions, such as the anti-globalisation protests in Seattle, anti-war demonstrations in London, or demonstrations in Madrid and other Spanish cities before the 2004 general election.
