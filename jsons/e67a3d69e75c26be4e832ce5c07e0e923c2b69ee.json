Additionally, it has a poorly defined clinical presentation, and no known treatment or prevention methods. Collectively, these factors underscore the need for early diagnosis. Molecular tests have been developed to detect SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with varying levels of sensitivity. However, RNA amplification methods have been demonstrated to be more sensitive for the detection of some RNA viruses. We therefore developed a real-time nucleic acid sequencebased amplification (NASBA) test for SARS-CoV. A number of primer/beacon sets were designed to target different regions of the SARS-CoV genome, and were tested for sensitivity and specificity. The performance of the assays was compared with RT-PCR assays. A multi-target real-time NASBA application was developed for detection of SARS-CoV polymerase (Pol) and nucleocapsid (N) genes. The N targets were found to be consistently more sensitive than the Pol targets, and the real-time NASBA assay demonstrates equivalent sensitivity when compared to testing by real-time RT-PCR. A multitarget real-time NASBA assay has been successfully developed for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV.",

Culture detection of live SARS-CoV requires biosafety level three facilities and expertise, which severely limits the number of facilities or institutions in which it can be performed. In addition, cell culture isolation of SARS-CoV is not as sensitive as detection by real-time RT-PCR [Emery et al., 2004] . Conversely, serological methods have been shown to be sensitive for confirmation of infection but detection of antibodies occurs late in the course of illness, which limits their efficacy for early detection and disease control . The focus of early diagnosis has therefore centered on the development of molecular-based assays including conventional as well as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. It has been suggested that these provide the greatest sensitivity for testing within the first 2 weeks of infection [Wu et al., 2004] . Studies have found that realtime RT-PCR is more sensitive [Emery et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004] , and is less likely to produce cross contamination of samples compared to end-point RT-PCR. Nested PCR assays have also been described Yam et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2004] but they carry an inherently high risk of sample cross contamination.",

These sets were optimized by evaluating different combinations for each target, and optimized primer/beacon combinations were then tested on a 10-fold dilution series of cultured SARS-CoV RNA (derived from the Frankfurt SARS index case) (Fig. 2) . Initial analysis indicated the Pol 1 and N2 primer sets gave the greatest sensitivity followed by the Pol 2 set as defined by detection of these targets at the highest dilution of SARS-CoV RNA. None of the primer sets demonstrated cross-reactivity with other clinically relevant viruses [Zhang et al., 2004] . Differences in signal amplitude between the various targets are a function of the individual kinetics of a given primer/probe set interaction with its target and do not relate to sensitivity since the assay is not quantitative. In order to establish a negative cut-off for the assay, nine SARS-CoV negative respiratory samples were tested, and a fluorescence value greater than the average of the negative controls plus four standard deviations was defined as positive for the assay.",

For this reason it was anticipated that an assay targeting the N gene might be more sensitive than those targeting other regions of the viral genome, due to the predicted abundance of N RNA transcripts in SARS-CoV infected cells. Indeed, the N primer/beacon sets outperformed the Pol 2 set and could consistently detect SARS-CoV at a 10 \u00c06 and frequently at a 10 \u00c07 dilution of whole genome Urbani strain RNA (Table III) .

The N targets consistently demonstrate higher sensitivity over the Pol target for RT-PCR, while in the NASBA assay, the N targets are mores sensitive than the Pol 2 but not the Pol 1. Additionally, the Taqman SARS2 (N) and NASBA N1 targets appear to be equivalent, while the Taqman SARS3 (N) target was at least an order of magnitude more sensitive compared to all the targets (Table III) .

The NASBA SARS-CoV assay consistently detected at least four different targets in six different isolates, demonstrating sensitivity across different times and geographical locations of the disease outbreak. The N and Pol targets show greatest sensitivity for real-time NASBA detection of SARS-CoV in the materials tested and this is concordant with results obtained for similar targets in the CDC Taqman test [Emery et al., 2004] . Similar to the N region, the 5 0 -leader sequence is present in all the subgenomic RNA populations. It was therefore anticipated that this target might also provide increased sensitivity for SARS-CoV detection. This sequence, however, is too short for efficient design of NASBA primer sets, necessitating placement of the downstream primer outside the leader region. Consequently, the 5 0 -L NASBA assay detects only genomic RNA, and exhibits lower sensitivity than assays targeting the N region.",

Additionally, detection of N gene transcripts did not provide greater sensitivity over those of the Pol gene in clinical specimens from 29 confirmed SARS patients.

This presents a challenge for early detection and highlights the need for extremely sensitive assays to aid in the early diagnosis of disease; particularly important given the wide variation in clinical presentation and difficulties faced with diagnosing based on symptoms. To date, at least three types of diagnostic laboratory tests are available but all have their limitations [World Health Organization Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003; Chen et al., 2004] . ELISA tests can only reliably detect antigen after a week post onset of symptoms depending on the specimen [Lau et al., 2004] , making detection of cases difficult at the time they are most infectious. Likewise, an indirect immunofluorescence assay is only able to detect antibodies reliably after day 10 [World Health Organization Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003]. Any culturebased detection requires specialized biosafety level three facilities, which are beyond the scope of most diagnostic laboratories. A number of RT-PCR tests have been developed and some have been simultaneously evaluated [Yam et al., 2003; Bressler and Nolte, 2004; Mahony et al., 2004] , but detection of SARS-CoV RNA by real-time NASBA has not been previously reported in the literature.",
