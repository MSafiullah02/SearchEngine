Also, when residents returned from the hospital after a follow-up appointment or on discharge from the hospital after medical treatment, they stayed in an isolated room in the nursing home for 14 days. The resident under confinement had to wear a facemask and activities were restricted in the isolated room.

In addition, health education regarding SARS and the importance of good personal hygiene in limiting the spread of SARS had been provided to residents via various sources and means, such as nurses giving health talks and pamphlets given to residents and relatives. To our surprise, however, very few of the participants in the nursing home could be described as knowledgeable regarding SARS and its prevention. Some of these residents were worried about contracting the disease themselves. However, the majority of the residents studied had either little or no knowledge about SARS. Not surprisingly perhaps, those with the least knowledge also had the least concerns about contracting the disease. The lack of knowledge and concern may make them more vulnerable in terms of contracting SARS. It is normal and justifiable to have concerns about contracting a potentially fatal disease, and these concerns can be useful to drive the implementation of precautionary measures that require active cooperation and participation of individuals. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that justifiable and constructive concerns must not be allowed to become destructive fears. The results of this study indicate that more tailored health education specifically targeted to inform and allay the fears of the elderly in the nursing home would be useful.",

Nonetheless, vigilance must be maintained, especially in the care of high-risk elderly subjects. All citizens, the elderly in particular, must continue to practice general preventive measures and guard against lapses in personal and environmental hygiene. Awareness of SARS should remain high because this disease is likely to remain a threat worldwide for some time to come. Our experience in Hong Kong shows SARS to be highly infectious and that infection in an elderly person is often fatal. Increasing awareness of SARS in the elderly and their caregivers and enhancing preventive measures are crucial to avoid new outbreaks. The worry and fear of an outbreak of SARS among staff working in the nursing home are still high. More in-service training, support, and counseling are strongly indicated to promote prevention and improve quality of care. Tailored education for the residents of elderly care homes is also important because their active participation is needed in SARS prevention, and their fears and concerns of SARS, while often justified and possibly useful, must not be allowed to compromise their quality of life.",
