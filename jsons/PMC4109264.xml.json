New molecular technologies, such as MassTag polymerase chain reaction (PCR),\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n microbial microarrays,\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n and unbiased high throughput pyrosequencing\n9\n have facilitated efficient differential diagnosis of infectious diseases, as well as pathogen surveillance and discovery. The databases needed to recognize sequences as host or microbial have improved dramatically. Appreciation that more than 75% of emerging infectious diseases represent zoonoses has also had an impact. To address this issue, sample collection needs to be more proactive in addressing infections of wildlife, domestic animals and vectors as well as humans, examining bush meat, and promoting surveillance in regions defined through modeling as \u201chot spots\u201d of infectious disease emergence.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n\n",

Treatment decisions must frequently balance potential benefit with potential toxicity from antiviral therapy. When toxicity is minimal, but supplies are limited, it may nonetheless be imperative that a drug be reserved for those cases for which it will be effective. Finally, treatment is frequently more effective early in the course when the viral burden is lower. It is important to appreciate that agents other than viruses can cause hemorrhagic fevers. In one recent example, an individual who succumbed to acute febrile illness and multi\u2010organ failure during an outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever was ultimately found through panmicrobial microarray analysis to have malaria.\n8\n Effective antimalarial therapy might have been instituted had the appropriate diagnosis been established at an earlier time point.",

Nonetheless, in viral hemorrhagic fevers, continuing the discovery process through to implication of a candidate is typically straightforward because disease is acute, the agent is present at high levels in the affected tissue at the time the disease is manifest, morphological changes consistent with infection are evident, classical or molecular methods for isolation and characterization are commonly successful, and there is frequently evidence of an adaptive immune response. Thus, even where one does not have the animal model required to formally meet the bar for proof of causation established by Koch and Loeffler (the agent is present in every case of a disease; it is specific for that disease; it can be propagated in culture and inoculated into a na\u00efve host to cause the same disease),\n13\n a strong candidate is rarely controversial.",

Nonetheless, it is important to recognize the pivotal roles of clinical acumen, pathology, serology, and classical culture techniques. Clinicians and epidemiologists are the unheralded heroes at the front line in pathogen discovery. They appreciate the appearance of anomalies, collect materials for investigation, and persuade their laboratory colleagues to invest in the search for known and novel pathogens. Anatomic pathology joined to immunohistochemistry can be instrumental in directing molecular work. Here investigators exploit the cross\u2010reactive properties of antisera to reveal the presence of agents related to those already known. Although the large panels of antisera required for this type of work are restricted to a few highly specialized research centers, the potency of this approach is underscored by fact that the discoveries of Sin Nombre virus,\n14\n Nipah virus,\n15\n West Nile virus\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n and LuJo virus\n20\n were facilitated by demonstration of viral proteins in tissues, which in turn, allowed focused consensus PCR analyses.

Such assays have revolutionized blood banking, management of HIV and helpatitis C virus, and enabled containment of outbreaks of infectious disease. Degenerate primers can be employed in singleplex PCR assays at reduced stringency to facilitate detection of related but unknown organisms. However, clinical manifestations are not typically pathognomonic of infection with specific pathogens; thus, unless an investigator has clues from pathology or serology that can be used to focus a search, this is a cumbersome strategy even if sample, resources, and time are sufficient to invest in many singleplex assays for different agents. Multiplex assays, however, allow an investigator to test many hypotheses in parallel. The number of candidates considered in such assays can range from less than 10 with multiplex PCR, to thousands with microarrays, to the entire tree of life with unbiased high throughput sequencing.",

Frequently, epidemiology, serology, or pathology suggests one or a few candidates, allowing the use of consensus PCR with degenerate primers. Where no such clues are known or assays for single agents fail, syndromic multiplex PCR assays can be used to test several candidates simultaneously. Gel\u2010based multiplex assays that distinguish products by size continue to be used. However, these assays are more labor intensive and less sensitive than assays based on fluorescence reporter dyes or mass spectrometric analyses, where automation enables high throughput and sensitivity that approaches that of singleplex PCR. Fluorescence reporter\u2010based assays take several forms: those where fluorescence reporter dyes are attached to primers (Scorpion; Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA), others where an intermediate labeled oligonucleotide is cleaved (Taqman; Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) or hybridized (molecular beacons) to separate an excitatory and quencher moiety, and another where amplification products bind to labeled beads (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). Two multiplex platforms have been developed that combine PCR and mass spectroscopy (MS) for sensitive detection of several targets simultaneously. One of them, Triangulation Identification for Genetic Evaluation of Risks (TIGER) uses matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS to directly measure the molecular weights of PCR products obtained in an experimental sample and to compare them with a database of known or predicted product weights.\n30\n, \n31\n The other, MassTag PCR, uses Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI) MS to read photocleavable molecular weight reporter tags attached to PCR primers.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n32\n\n",

Viral microarrays can be coarsely divided into those that address 10\u2013100 agents and those designed for detection of thousands of agents including unknowns. Arrays designed to address a limited number of agents, for example respiratory virus resequencing arrays, may employ multiplex consensus PCR to amplify specific genetic targets.\n33\n Although these arrays, which typically employ probes of less than 25 nt, may allow speciation of agents, they do not truly exploit the utility of microarrays for unbiased microbe detection. Oligonucleotide microarrays can comprise hundreds of thousands of features. Probes of up to 70 nt are not uncommon; thus, unlike PCR, or resequencing arrays, where short primer sequences demand precise complementarity between probe and target, such arrays are less likely to be confounded by minor sequence variation. This can be a considerable advantage for detection of rapidly evolving targets, such as RNA viruses. Additionally, one can incorporate both microbial and host gene targets in high\u2010density arrays. This affords an opportunity to both detect microbes and assess host responses for signatures consistent with various classes of infectious agents. Viral arrays can facilitate cloning and sequence analysis as well as pathogen identification. Following random amplification protocols, hybridized products typically range from 200 nt to >1000 nt. Because arrays display probes representing several different genomic regions for each virus, one can rapidly recover sequence by elution, not only for the hybridized products, but also for sequences between those products through use of PCR amplification and classical dideoxy\u2010sequencing.",

Both rest on an amplification step that amplifies host and microbial sequences with similar efficiency. In acellular samples, such as serum or tissue culture medium, this is not an issue because host nucleic acid is minimal; however, in tissues, host nucleic acid is more likely to be dominant. Chromosomal DNA can be eliminated through DNase digestion; however, ribosomal RNA is more difficult to address. We have seen only modest improvements in sensitivity with rRNA capture or digestion.",

Agents sufficiently distant in sequence to confound hybridization to primers or probes may still be identified by unbiased high throughput sequencing.\n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n Depending on the platform employed, this strategy yields sequence fragments that typically range in size from 30 to 500 nt. These fragments are then used to query databases for similar sequences that represent host or microbe. By definition, truly novel micro\u2010organisms will not be represented in a database. However, we have been able to detect similarities of 40% at the aa level that are sufficient for genus level identification that were not detected at the nt level. Even where an agent is identified using other, less expensive and labor intensive methods, unbiased high throughput sequencing may be employed because this approach eliminates time consuming cloning prior to sequencing needed with classical dideoxy methods. An example here is the Bundibugyo virus, a new ebolavirus species associated with a recent hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Uganda, that was discovered using conventional methods, but genetically characterized through pyrosequencing.\n39\n\nSubtractive cloning may succeed where unbiased high throughput sequencing fails. Borna disease virus, for example, the first agent discovered with unbiased molecular methods, would not have been found by consensus PCR, microarray or high throughput sequencing because its genomic sequence is so dissimilar to other agents. New analytical models based in neurolinguistics and cryptography may facilitate recognition of microbial sequences even when they lack similarity to known microbes at primary sequence level.",
