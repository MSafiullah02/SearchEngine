Feliformia carnivores include the Hyenidae (spotted, striped, and brown hyenas as well as aardwolf), Viverridae (civets, binturongs, genets, and linsang), Prionodontidae (a monogeneric family of linsangs), Eupleridae (which includes fossa, civets, mongoose, and falanouc), and Herpestidae (which includes mongoose and meerkats) (Zhou et al., 2017). A notable feature of the feliform carnivores is a double chambered auditory bulla composed of two bones joined by a septum (Ewer, 1973). Many of these species are listed as vulnerable or endangered (see Supplemental Materials Table e1) due to habitat loss and hunting.",

As an example, to some, binturongs smell like buttered popcorn. This specific odor has been attributed to a volatile compound in the urine (Greene et al., 2016). The use of anal-sac gland secretion from civets for musk scent in perfume is well documented, but it is also a welfare concern due to varying husbandry standards (Anonis, 1997, Klok and Nugteren, 1973, Tolosa and Regassa, 2007).",

For most of the species in this chapter that have been studied, placentation is zonary and endotheliochorial. Haemophagous organs may occur early in gestation in some species but regress during pregnancy. The placenta of the hyena is unusual in that it is hemochorial (Enders et al., 2006).

Myocardial inclusions without associated inflammation are a common histological finding in captive raccoons; there is no known effect on cardiac function (Hamir, 2011b, Hamir et al., 2007). These inclusions can be basophilic, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive, and diastase resistant or eosinophilic.

Both anticoagulant toxins and those that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation are often manufactured into green-blue pellets or cakes that may be identified in the gastric or intestinal contents of poisoned individuals. Anticoagulant rodenticides include first generation (e.g., warfarin, diphacinone, chlorophacinone, and coumachlor) and second-generation (e.g., brodifacoum, bromodiolone, and difethialone) compounds. These rodenticides inhibit vitamin K reactivation, thus preventing production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. In one long-term, unpublished survey of free-ranging raccoons in Northern California, up to 80% of raccoons tested from a rehabilitation center over 10 years were positive for rodenticides (personal communication, M. Piazza and K. Kacmarcik). Other studies in raccoons (Daniels, 2013, Stone et al., 1999) and other free-ranging wildlife species (Gabriel et al., 2012, Rattner et al., 2014) also found frequent rodenticide exposure and indicating an important risk. Gross and histologic lesions include hemorrhage in multiple anatomic sites including the subcutis, brain, pericardial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities, and within the gastrointestinal tract. Definitive diagnosis is made detecting anticoagulant rodenticides by high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in liver, serum samples, whole blood, or gastrointestinal contents.",

While these mineralized foci are sometimes associated with mild inflammation and fibrosis, the lack of associated clinical signs and lack of disruption of surrounding tissue make these foci of mineralization an incidental finding (Hamir, 2011a). Another commonly encountered lesion in the CNS of raccoons is neuroaxonal degeneration, which is seen consistently in the gracilis and cuneate nuclei of the medulla and is characterized by abundant vacuolated neurons and axonal spheroids. This lesion has no associated inflammation or clinical signs, and has been reported in young and adult free-ranging and captive raccoons (Hamir, 2011b, Hamir et al., 2002, Hamir et al., 2007). Additionally, perivascular eosinophilic cuffs, primarily in the gray matter of the cerebrum are not uncommon in free-ranging adult raccoons.

Age likely plays a role in the oncogenesis, as none of the 37 free-ranging juvenile raccoons in one of the studies had thyroid pathology.

            "text": "A newly recognized group of neoplastic diseases in free-ranging raccoons in the western United States are neuroglial brain tumors. The tumors are associated with high levels of a novel raccoon polyomavirus (RacPyV) (Church et al., 2016a, Dela Cruz et al., 2013). These tumors are consistently found in the olfactory tract and bulb of raccoons, and in some cases are so extensive that they extend rostrally into the nasal cavity (Fig. 12.4\n). Histologically these tumors have a varied appearance, ranging from bundled spindloid cells to sheets of polygonal cells interrupted by serpentine areas of necrosis with a pseudopallisading pattern (Giannitti et al., 2014) (Fig. 12.5\n). Confirmation of causality in oncogenesis remains to be achieved. However, the viral oncogenic gene, Large T antigen, is highly transcribed in tumor tissue relative to host (Brostoff et al., 2014), and the RacPyV genome is maintained in cultured tumor cells and the transformed phenotype is lost if the viral genome is inhibited from binding to the host genome in vitro (Church et al., 2016a). This suggests RacPyV as having an important role in the promotion of neoplasia in neural stem cells. Serological surveys have confirmed viral exposure in free-ranging raccoons with and without tumors across the United States and Canada with, suggesting additional factors may play a role in the oncogenesis of these tumors (Church et al., 2016b).",

The majority of parvoviral disease outbreaks are due to infection with a virus characterized to be phylogenetically positioned between canine parvovirus 2 (the initial virus that emerged in the 1970s) and 2a (one of the three subtypes, 2a, 2b, and 2c, that have emerged more recently); however, raccoons can be infected with all subtypes of canine parvovirus (Allison et al., 2013). Disease manifestation with any of these parvoviruses consists of lymphoid depletion, lymphoid necrosis, and necrohemorrhagic enteritis with sloughing of intestinal crypt epithelium and mucosal collapse (\u201cradiomimetic\u201d lesions) (Fig. 12.7\n) (Kapil et al., 2010). While most studies examining natural parvovirus infection in raccoons do not address age of affected animals, anecdotally disease tends to be more severe in young raccoon kits than in adults, similar to disease in domestic animals. Several species of civets and genets can be also be infected with canine and feline parvoviruses; similar gastrointestinal lesions and lymphoid depletion are described (Demeter et al., 2009, Wicker et al., 2017). In a survey of vehicle-killed and hunted free-ranging mongoose, almost 60% of tested individuals harbored feline parvoviral DNA (Duarte et al., 2013). However, given extremely low recovery of viral DNA and the lack of pathologic lesions, it is unclear if this species is truly susceptible to parvoviral-induced disease or is merely susceptible to infection and has the potential to act as a virus reservoir and vector.",

The original studies of mycobacteriosis in meerkats identified Mycobacerium tuberculosis or M. bovis, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, as the causative organisms. However, more recent molecular analyses have identified a novel tuberculous mycobacterial species, M. suricatta, in meerkats and the closely related M. mungi in mongoose (Alexander et al., 2002, Alexander et al., 2010, Parsons et al., 2013). M. microti has also been reported in meerkat (Palgrave et al., 2012). Epidemiological studies in wild meerkats suggest that mycobacterial infections spread locally within clusters of closely interacting individuals within a group, particularly among grooming individuals (Drewe et al., 2011). The pattern of lesions suggests infection is via inhalation. Social behaviors are also thought to be important in the transmission of M. mungi in banded mongoose. High levels of M. mungi organisms are found in anal gland and nasal planum of mongoose, suggesting olfactory related behaviors as being important in transmission (Alexander et al., 2016). Infections have also been reported in civet and genet, and spoligotyping identified close similarity to M. bovis strains from buffalo suggestive of spillover infections (Katale et al., 2017).",

Acid-fast bacilli are common within lesions but many macrophages contain only a single bacillus. In mongoose, M. mungi lesions are common in the skin of the nasal planum and nasal cavity (Fig. 12.11\n). In mongoose, lesions in the lung were adjacent to vessels and thus fit a pattern of hematogenous spread rather than inhalation (Alexander et al., 2016). Similar to meerkats, fibrosis is minimal and central caseous necrosis within granulomas is only variable.

A related roundworm, B. potosis, was recently described in captive kinkajous. Its zoonotic potential, if any, is currently unknown (Tokiwa et al., 2014). Physaloptera rara and Gnathostoma procyonis are also common in raccoons. Infection with these gastric nematodes is also typically asymptomatic, but ulcers may be seen in heavily parasitized individuals (Davidson, 2006). The subcutaneous nematode of raccoons, Dracunculus insignis, can cause edema and inflammation in the subcutis and skeletal muscle fascia, and extrusion of the female worm through the skin may result in an ulcerative wound (Davidson, 2006). These worms must be distinguished from larvae of the subcutaneous tapeworm Spirometra mansonoides, which are smaller and flatter than D. insignis.\n",

The pyogranulomatous pneumonia seen in raccoons with CDV and Toxoplasma coinfections are similar to those described in other species. Toxoplasma gondii has also been transmitted readily in an experimental setting to raccoons (Hamir, 2011a).",

Snakes are the definitive and canids are the intermediate hosts. Encysted nymphs in the striped hyena were present throughout the omentum, mesentery, diaphragm, intestines, liver, spleen, kidneys, and urinary bladder, where they were surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule and mild, chronic or neutrophilic (intestinal) inflammation. Diagnosis of pentastomiasis is typically based on identification of the characteristic parasites on gross necropsy examination. Histology and PCR with DNA sequencing support the gross diagnosis and in the case of the latter, it can be used to speciate the parasite.Fleas are a common, generally species-specific parasite. Free-ranging raccoons in the United States are frequently infested with Orchopeas howardi, though they can also be infested by fleas from the Ctenocephalides genus (Hunter et al., 1979, Monello and Gompper, 2009). Raccoons are also frequently infested with the louse\nTrichodectes octomaculatus. Infestation by these ectoparasites rarely causes disease.
