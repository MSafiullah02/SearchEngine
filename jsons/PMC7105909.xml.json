Studies have shown that the filtration efficiency for surgical masks is highly variable depending on the type of mask and the manufacturer.22, 23 The filtration efficiency can be as high as that of a surgical N95 respirator, but even when surgical masks with the most efficient filter media (ie, high-filtration surgical laser masks) are properly worn, the fit factor obtained is quite low. Oberg and Brosseau22 conducted filtration performance and fit tests with nine types of surgical masks and found that none of the models tested exhibited adequate filter performance and facial fit characteristics to be considered equivalent to a surgical N95 respirator. Surgical masks are not designed to seal to the face. Without an adequate seal to the face, inhaled breath is not forced through the filter and instead flows through the gaps around the seal area, providing minimal protection by allowing potentially hazardous contaminants to enter the workers\u2019 breathing zone through gaps between the wearer\u2019s face and the mask. Therefore, surgical and high-filtration surgical laser masks do not provide the degree of protection to be considered respiratory PPE.",

Health care workers assigned to surgical suites must be aware that this environment has two types of particulate hazards: the particles themselves and the viable biological pathogens that account for some particles. As stated earlier, the size of the particle affects how long it remains suspended in the air and how far it can travel into the respiratory tract. Electrosurgical procedures generate particles about 0.07 mcm in size, laser procedures create particles about 0.31 mcm in size,2, 32 and ultrasonic scalpels produce particles that range in size from 0.35 mcm to 6.5 mcm.2 Particles smaller than 5 mcm are categorized as lung-damaging dust, and working in surgical smoke can result in acute and chronic respiratory changes including emphysema, asthma, and chronic bronchitis.2 It has been reported that small particles less than 1.1 mcm in diameter constitute 77% of the particulate matter found in surgical smoke.33, 34 Surgical laser masks do not seal to the face and offer no protection from particles smaller than 1 mcm in size.32 In fact, \u201cif the wearer wants to reduce inhalation of smaller, inhalable particles (those less than 100 [mcm]), they need to obtain and properly use a NIOSH-certified respirator.\u201d16\n",

In 1990, a 44-year-old surgeon was treated for removal of laryngeal papillomas. The DNA tests of the lesions indicated HPV types 6 and 11, and the only source of contamination was traced back to the surgeon\u2019s patients who had undergone laser surgery.41 A second case involved a 28-year-old gynecological OR nurse who repeatedly assisted in laser surgical and electrosurgical excisions of anogenital condylomas.
