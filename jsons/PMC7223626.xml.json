It means that these plants are not considered to be effective source for HupA production at the commercial scale. As a result, researchers tried to find other methods to produce HupA such as in vitro plant tissue cultivation and chemical synthesis. Tissue culturing was not considered as a successful technique for HupA production at a large scale (Ma and Gang 2008; Ishiuchi et al. 2013). Although HupA was totally synthesized from (R)-pulegone (Ding et al. 2012), the chemical synthesis of HupA showed some limitations such as complex interactions, continual pollution, and expensive processes (Koshiba et al. 2009). As these trials have not achieved satisfactory results to be applied at a large industrial scale, the discovery of HupA-producing endophytic fungi from the tissues of Huperziaceae plant species provides an alternative solution.",

Thus, concentration of drugs in the target neural cells will be significantly increased with respect to the traditional methods of treatment without nano-carriers (Wen et al. 2017). This superior activity of nano-carriers can be attributed to their tiny size and their ability to be bounded with specific moieties for better selectivity and permeability (Peer et al. 2007;Arruebo et al. 2009;Tiwari et al. 2011).",

The principal advantages of SLNPs are their higher selectivity, biocompatibility, absence of organic solvents during preparation, and improved drug release. However, they exhibited some restrictions such as fixed drug packing space and drug removal capacity throughout the storage process (poor drug loading efficiency) (Mukherjee et al. 2009). To overcome limitations of SLNPs, NLCs were developed and received considerable investigations (M\u00fcller et al. 2002). NLCs were extensively employed for HupA delivery due to their unique solid-liquid lipid matrix as displayed in Fig. 4.",

In addition, they have the ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs and they exhibit superior protection ability of encapsulated drugs against enzymatic degradation (Bruch et al. 2019;Mirab et al. 2019).

As a recommendation, besides the conventional submerged fermentation (SMF), solid-state fermentation (SSF) may be a promising alternative for the production of AChE inhibitors. Over the years, SSF proved to be a promising system for the production of many valuable products. SSF has many advantages over the conventional SMF including resistance of microorganisms to catabolic repression, low-cost production process, production of metabolites at higher ,yields and the potentiality of applying agro-industrial wastes as nutritional rich substrates (El-Sayed et al. 2019c, 2020c).",
