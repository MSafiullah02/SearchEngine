            "text": "Seizures are the manifestation of abnormal synchronous electrical activity in the brain and are the most common neurologic disorder in dogs. Seizures may be categorized as generalized, when both cerebral hemispheres are involved, or partial, when cerebral involvement is focal. Generalized seizures result in loss of consciousness and the whole body is affected with signs such as paddling, convulsions, or increased tone. Salivation is common and some animals may urinate, defecate, or vomit at the time of the seizure. Partial seizures affect only a portion of the body. Consciousness is unimpaired during simple partial seizures and is altered during complex partial seizures. During psychomotor seizures, a complex partial seizure, the animal may appear panicked as it compulsively runs around, and may appear aggressive, hissing or growling. A preictal period before the seizure and a postictal period lasting minutes to hours after the seizure are common with generalized seizures. Preictal and postictal signs may include anxiety, attention seeking, panting, and pacing. The recognition of seizures can sometimes be difficult because vestibular episodes, dyskinesias, and syncopal episodes can appear seizurelike. A thorough history should be gathered including the potential for toxin exposure, familial history, previous events, activity during onset, time of onset, duration of the event, elimination during the event, and interictal behavioral or gait changes. In the pediatric patient, information regarding birth, litter mates, suckling, and weight gain is also important. Seizure disorders in young animals pose different considerations as to cause and therapeutic decisions compared with adult animals. Congenital, developmental, metabolic, toxic, infectious, and inflammatory causes are considered more likely in puppies and kittens.",

Patients with underlying causes other than idiopathic epilepsy may require medication in addition to anticonvulsant therapy. In addition, patients with secondary epilepsy often require anticonvulsant therapy sooner than those with primary/idiopathic epilepsy. Complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry, and urinalysis should be done for all dogs and cats presenting for seizures. Hypoglycemia should be ruled out in all puppies and kittens.

Congenital extrahepatic PSSs are usually single vessels that connect the portal venous system to the systemic circulation. They may arise from any vessel and account for most shunts. Portocaval shunts are more common than portoazygous shunts.1 PSS in large-breed dogs are typically intrahepatic in location. PSS often causes episodic encephalopathic signs such as mentation changes, head pressing, vocalization, ataxia, blindness, and seizures. Between 79% and 82% of dogs have central nervous system (CNS) signs associated with PSS.1, 2 Neurologic signs are typically worse after eating and often wax and wane. Other signs include vomiting, anorexia, polyuria, polydipsia, decreased weight, hematuria, and stranguria. The cause of hepatic encephalopathy is unclear, with several potential causes including hyperammonemia, altered tryptophan synthesis, false neurotransmitter synthesis, alterations in amino acid neurotransmitters, and increased cerebral endogenous benzodiazepine concentrations.3\n",

A low-protein diet consisting of high-quality digestible protein is recommended. Commercially available liver disease diets or home-cooked diets with chicken, cottage cheese, rice, and pasta are typically fed. Feeding smaller portions more frequently may be beneficial. Ampicillin 22 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 6 hours or metronidazole 7.5 to 10 mg/kg by mouth twice a day are commonly used to decrease NH3-producing bacteria. Lactulose acidifies colonic contents leading to conversion of NH3 to NH4. Lactulose also decreases fecal transit time, thereby speeding the elimination of bacteria and NH3. Lactulose is given to effect, to produce a soft stool. Gastrointestinal ulceration is an increased risk in patients with PSS. Thus, gastric protectants such as famotidine 0.5 mg/kg by mouth twice a day or omeprazole 0.5 to 1 mg/kg by mouth every 24 hours should be given.6 Anticonvulsant therapy is indicated if seizures are present or given perioperatively.",

Various techniques are available, including surgical ligation or partial ligation, or the use of devices that gradually occlude the aberrant vessel, such as an ameroid constrictor or a cellophane band. The use of ameroid constrictors and cellophane bands has decreased mortality associated with surgery. Surgical therapy is typically considered superior to medical therapy; however, both therapies can be beneficial. A study comparing surgical therapy with medical therapy indicated a shunt-related mortality of 10.1% of dogs treated surgically versus a shunt-related mortality of 29.6% of dogs treated medically. Perioperative mortality was 4% in this study.7 Postoperative seizures are reported in 5% to 18% of dogs surgically and typically occur within 3 days of surgery.2, 8 Neurologic signs may occur from decreased circulating endogenous benzodiazepine ligands, imbalances in excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters,8 or hypoglycemia.2 Postoperative generalized seizures have been associated with high mortality, whereas dogs with postoperative partial seizures typically respond to therapy.1 Although phenobarbital therapy did not significantly reduce the incidence of seizures, it did seem to reduce the severity of seizures in a study.2 None of 42 dogs treated with levetiracetam 20 mg/kg by mouth 3 times a day had postoperative seizures in one study.8\n",

A ventral and/or lateral strabismus can occur because of a skull or orbit deformity or from increased pressure on the mesencephalic tegmentum (Fig. 3\n).14 A thinned calvarium, decreased cerebral tissue, and changes in cerebral vascularity can cause hydrocephalic animals to be more sensitive to head trauma.

Brain imaging can be helpful in differentiating GME from other inflammatory brain disease such as necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) and necrotizing leukoencephalitis (NLE). NME and NLE have characteristic abnormalities on MRI that, if present, can help differentiate them from GME. In GME, MRI results often identify edema (hyperintense lesions on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]) and contrast-enhancing lesions (Fig. 8\n). MRI abnormalities are typically located within white matter consistent with the histologic distribution of the disease. At times, patients with GME have normal MRI results.34\n",

In rapidly deteriorating dogs or in dysphagic dogs, dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.25 mg/kg IV or subcutaneously every 24 hours to twice a day is given. Prednisone at 1 mg/kg by mouth twice a day is later given. In severe or refractory cases, cytosine arabinoside may be given at 50 mg/m2 twice a day for 2 consecutive days and then repeated if necessary every 3 weeks. As an alternative, procarbazine at 25 mg/m2 by mouth every 24 hours35 or cyclosporine 3 to 15 mg/kg by mouth twice a day36 may be given. Routine monitoring of the CBC should be done when these drugs are given. Serial urinalysis with or without culture is also recommended in immunosuppressed dogs. Clinical signs and serial CSF evaluation are used to assess therapeutic success. Prednisone is tapered over a period of several months. Many dogs require long-term prednisone therapy. Adjunctive therapy such as cytosine arabinoside, cyclosporine, or procarbazine may lessen the dependence on corticosteroids and lead to a more favorable prognosis. The prognosis for GME has been considered guarded. The median survival time for dogs with focal signs was 114 days, whereas dogs with multifocal signs had a median survival time of 8 days in one study.31 Recent studies have shown a better prognosis. One study reported a median survival time of 14.0 months with procarbazine and prednisone treatment compared with 0.62 months for dogs not receiving treatment.37 Another study showed a median survival time of 930 days with use of cyclosporine or in combination with corticosteroids or ketoconazole.36 A study comparing the use of lomustine and prednisolone with prednisolone alone yielded a median survival time of 457 days compared with 329 days, respectively. The difference in survival time between groups was not statistically significant.38 A study evaluating the use of cytosine arabinoside and prednisone in 10 dogs with inflammatory brain disease of unknown cause indicated a median survival time of 531 days. The study included dogs with suspected GME as well as NME or NLE.39\n",

In pugs, Chihuahuas, Maltese terriers, shih tzu and papillon the necrotic condition is often adjacent to the cerebral gray-white matter junction. In the Yorkshire terrier, NLE causes necrotic white matter lesions in the cerebrum and typically inflammatory lesions in the brainstem and cerebellum. Because of the breed-specific variance in lesion location it is uncertain whether these diseases are variants of the same disease or different diseases.40 NME and NLE have also been reported in the Pekingese and French bulldog.40, 41 Male and female, young to middle-aged dogs are typically affected; however, dogs as old as 10 years of age have been reported. Seizures are common. Mentation changes, circling, and placing deficits may also be seen. Vestibular signs may predominate when the brainstem is affected in NLE. CSF typically indicates a mononuclear pleocytosis with increased protein. However, at times CSF is normal. MRI helps confirm the location and presence of cavitative lesions. MRI may also differentiate the disease from GME. Lesions with NME are multifocal, asymmetric, and present at the gray-white matter junction. They are typically hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR imaging and isointense or hypointense on T1 imaging. Contrast enhancement is variable (Fig. 9\n). NLE lesions are typically asymmetric, multifocal, and affect the subcortical white matter. The lesions are hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR imaging and isointense or hypointense on T1 imaging. Contrast enhancement is also variable (Fig. 10\n).32 Recommended treatment is prednisone at 1 mg/kg by mouth twice a day with a gradual reduction in dose if response to therapy occurs. The prognosis for necrotizing encephalitis is poor. Mean survival time with corticosteroid treatment was 97 days in one study.42 Dogs with necrotizing encephalitis may be less responsive to therapy than those treated for suspected GME.",

Animals with bacterial meningoencephalitis may have a fever or leukocytosis. Lethargy and apparent back pain may also be present. Thorough examination, abdominal ultrasound, and thoracic radiographs can identify a nidus of infection. The infection can arise from a dermal lesion or a recent surgical procedure with hematogenous spread to the CNS.

However, severe neutrophilic pleocytosis can also be seen with noninfectious inflammatory diseases such as steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis. MRI may identify meningeal enhancement, abscess formation, or otitis media interna consistent with an infectious process, making steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis less likely (Figs. 11 and 12\n). Culturing the CSF and/or urine may help identify a bacterial cause. Visualization of bacteria in the CSF allows a more definitive diagnosis of bacterial meningoencephalitis. Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, and various anaerobes are typically present in bacterial meningoencephalitis.43 CNS penetration is often a consideration when choosing an antibiotic. At first, the compromised blood-brain barrier allows better penetration into the CNS. Once the blood barrier is intact, antibiotic penetration may be more difficult. Thus, a longer course of antibiotic therapy, higher dosages, or choosing an antibiotic that more reliably penetrates the CNS may be required. Chloramphenicol reaches high CNS concentrations, but is not typically used because of the potential adverse effects, particularly in neonates. Doxycycline penetrates the CNS, but its bacteriostatic nature and concerns for its use in young animals should be considered. Trimethoprim/sulfa also reaches high CNS concentrations, but concerns regarding potential adverse effects have also limited its use. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is broad spectrum, but reaches low CSF concentrations when the blood-brain barrier is intact. Fluoroquinolones are good choices for Staphylococcus and E coli, but have variable effects on Streptococcus and also reach low CSF concentrations.44\n",

Severe CDV infection can sometimes have a low titer from immunosuppression. Direct immunofluorescence testing of conjunctival, vaginal, and nasal smears can confirm CDV only within 3 weeks of infection.50 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can be helpful. PCR testing may be done on CSF, blood, conjunctiva, or urine. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR) is considered to be the best antemortem method used to detect CDV. RTPCR detected CDV RNA in 88% of infected dogs via whole blood or CSF testing and in 86% of infected dogs via serum testing.

Pneumonia, encephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, and myonecrosis are the predominant lesions in neonates. Ninety-two percent of affected dogs are less than 1 year old. Transplacental transmission is the major route of infection. An ascending paralysis is typically the presenting sign with possible progression to the cervical, brainstem, and cerebellar regions. Polyradiculoneuritis and polymyositis may result in hyperextension of the pelvic limbs. Creatine kinase can be increased when a polymyositis is present. CSF abnormalities typically include a mononuclear pleocytosis. The diagnosis can be supported via serum immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) titers. Affected dogs have IFA titers greater than 1:200. However, clinically normal dogs can have titers as high 1:800. Tachyzoites can be identified in cells from CSF, dermal lesions, and bronchial lavage.53 PCR of the CSF was positive in 4 of 5 dogs in one report.54 Clindamycin 10 to 15 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours for 4 weeks is typically used for neosporosis therapy,52 although trimethoprim sulfonamide 15 to 20 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours may also be used alone or concurrently with clindamycin. Clindamycin is effective against tachyzoites, but is likely ineffective against encysted bradyzoites. Despite clinical improvement the N caninum infection is not cleared from the body.55 The prognosis is considered poor,53 but successful treatment is possible. Delayed therapy, muscle fibrosis, and pelvic limb hyperextension are considered poor prognostic indicators.54\n",

It does not seem to cross the blood CSF barrier in detectable amounts.69 Itraconazole may successfully treat CNS cryptococcosis by crossing an inflamed blood-brain barrier or via drug accumulation within the highly lipid brain.70 In immunosuppressed people, initial treatment of cryptococcal meningitis has been a combination of intravenous amphotericin B and oral flucytosine. After 2 weeks of therapy, people are switched to azole therapy. Cryptococcus is susceptible to amphotericin B. However, the duration of use is limited because of poor CNS penetration and the potential for renal toxicity.71 Daily monitoring of renal values is recommended when administering amphotericin B. Lipid-complexed amphotericin B has increased efficacy and is less nephrotoxic than standard amphotericin B.59, 70 Flucytosine 50 mg/kg by mouth every 8 hours in cats44 penetrates well into the CSF, but should not be used as a single agent because resistance develops quickly.72 Flucytosine can cause dermal eruptions in dogs.62\n",

Autosomal recessive inheritance is most common.79 Anticonvulsant therapy is typically started when seizure frequency increases, particularly when 2 or more seizures occur within 6 months. A baseline period is helpful to determine the natural seizure frequency and can help assess response to anticonvulsant therapy. However, this baseline period should not be too long because early antiepileptic treatment may lead to better seizure control.80 Patients with cluster seizures, status epilepticus, or secondary epilepsy should have anticonvulsant therapy started without delay.

The patient\u2019s age, medical history, potential for adverse effects, severity of the seizure disorder, and client concerns must all be considered. In patients with a history of cluster seizures, status epilepticus, or a progressive cause for seizures, the author typically chooses phenobarbital given its increased efficacy compared with other anticonvulsant options. Otherwise, in young patients with a less severe seizure disorder, the author often chooses either potassium bromide or levetiracetam given the decreased chance of hepatotoxicity. If a client is unable to consistently give medication multiple times a day, then starting with potassium bromide is reasonable. However, for dogs with a history of gastrointestinal issues, the author typically avoids potassium bromide. Although each medication has its benefits and risks, there is not a universal perfect anticonvulsant. Each medication may need to be adjusted for optimal seizure control or because of potential adverse effects. Monotherapy is typically preferred for initial therapy. However, when the seizure disorder is refractory to monotherapy, then multidrug therapy is indicated in the pursuit of adequate seizure control.

            "text": "Phenobarbital historically has been the first-line treatment of seizures in dogs and cats. Phenobarbital is the most efficacious anticonvulsant, with one study reporting efficacy in 90% of suspected epileptic dogs.81 Phenobarbital increases the seizure threshold and decreases the spread to surrounding neurons. It enhances the inhibitory postsynaptic effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), inhibits glutamate activity, and decreases calcium flux across neuronal membranes. Peak levels are achieved 4 to 6 hours after oral administration and its half-life (T1/2) is 1.5 to 3 days. Phenobarbital metabolism increases with chronic therapy.82 Phenobarbital is typically started at 2.5 to 3 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours. The dose is then adjusted based on clinical response, adverse effects, and serum levels. Adverse effects include sedation, ataxia, polyphagia, polyuria/polydypsia (PU/PD), and increased liver enzymes. The potential for liver failure increases at serum levels of 35 to 40 \u03bcg/mL (therapeutic range, 15\u201340 \u03bcg/mL). Routine liver monitoring is recommended.82 Increases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) can result from enzyme induction rather than hepatic injury. Bile acid testing, bilirubin, and abdominal ultrasound were not affected by phenobarbital therapy in one study. Thus, bile acid testing, bilirubin, and abdominal ultrasound can help assess liver disease in dogs receiving phenobarbital.83 Larger increases in ALT compared with ALP are concerning because it also suggests hepatic disease. Hepatotoxicity can improve as the phenobarbital dose is lowered or withdrawn. However, with advanced liver disease, the effects can be irreversible and potentially fatal.80 Evaluating CBC and chemistry 2 to 4 weeks after starting therapy, 3 months later, and then every 6 months can be helpful. Bile acid testing should also be considered periodically or if hepatic enzymes are increasing. Phenobarbital\u2019s shorter T1/2, compared with bromide, allows quicker manipulation of plasma levels, making it a good choice for dogs with frequent seizures.",

A loading dose of potassium bromide can be given at 450 to 600 mg/kg by mouth total over the course of 5 days.82 Adverse effects are more common when using a loading dose.

A few studies with limited power have indicated 56% to 64% response to adjunctive levetiracetam therapy for epilepsy87, 88 as well as for emergency treatment of status epilepticus and cluster seizures.89 Levetiracetam binds synaptic vesicular protein SV2A. Levetiracetam may prevent hypersynchronization of burst firing and seizure propagation. The T1/2 is 4 hours in dogs and 5 hours in cats. Initial dosing was recommended at 10 to 20 mg/kg by mouth 3 times a day. However, a honeymoon effect was noted. After several months of therapy, seizure control was lost.87 This honeymoon phenomenon and pharmacokinetic evaluation has led to a recommended starting dose of 20 mg/kg by mouth 3 times a day.90 An extended-release formulation is now also available and is dosed at 20 mg/kg by mouth twice a day. The extended-release tablets are not suitable for small dogs or cats because the tablets should not be cut. The adverse effects of levetiracetam seem minimal with sedation/ataxia occurring uncommonly. Sixty-six percent of the drug is excreted unchanged through the kidneys. The cytochrome P 450 system does not seem to be involved. However, concurrent phenobarbital administration has been shown to decrease levetiracetam T1/2 and decreases levetiracetam blood levels. Thus dogs on both phenobarbital and levetiracetam concurrently may require higher dosages of levetiracetam.91 Levetiracetam is excreted into maternal milk and so should be used with caution in nursing animals. Levetiracetam should be used with caution in pregnant animals because high dosages have increased embryofetal mortality in rabbits and rats.44\n",

As with levetiracetam, a few reports with limited patient numbers have been published. One study indicated that 9 of 11 refractory epileptic dogs responded to zonisamide therapy in the first 8 months of therapy. However, only 6 of 11 responded after 17 months of therapy.92 Another study indicated that 7 of 12 refractory epileptic dogs responded to zonisamide therapy.93 Zonisamide monotherapy was effective in 6 of 10 epileptic dogs in another report.94 Zonisamide blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels and T-type calcium channels. Its T1/2 is about 15 hours in the dog and 35 hours in cats. Zonisamide is metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes and is also renally excreted. Its T1/2 is reduced with concurrent phenobarbital administration. Zonisamide is administered 5 to 10 mg/kg by mouth twice a day in dogs, with the higher dose range for dogs also receiving phenobarbital. Cats are given 5 to 10 mg/kg by mouth every 24 hours, because of the longer T1/2. Zonisamide is typically well tolerated, with anorexia, sedation, and ataxia being the most common adverse effects.80 Acute hepatopathy within 3 weeks of starting zonisamide therapy has recently been reported in 2 dogs.95, 96 Renal tubular acidosis has also been reported recently. Acid-base changes resolved after discontinuation of zonisamide.97 When zonisamide was given to pregnant dogs, ventricular septal defects, cardiomegaly, and valvular and arterial anomalies occurred. Thus zonisamide is not recommended for use in pregnant animals. It is unknown whether zonisamide is excreted into maternal milk.44\n",

The longer T1/2 of diazepam in cats makes it a possible candidate for long-term anticonvulsant therapy. However, the use of oral diazepam is limited because of the potential risk of severe/fatal liver disease in cats. Strict monitoring is required if diazepam is used orally in cats. Tolerance develops with maintenance use of benzodiazepines. Thus the short duration of action in dogs and the development of tolerance limit the use of benzodiazepines to the emergency setting.80, 82 Diazepam at 0.5 mg/kg IV or 1 to 2 mg/kg rectally is recommended for immediate treatment of seizures. The absorption of benzodiazepines when administered rectally is variable, resulting in questionable efficacy. Concurrent phenobarbital administration increases the metabolism of diazepam. Thus, the higher dose range is recommended for rectal diazepam when dogs are concurrently receiving phenobarbital therapy. Diazepam 0.5 mg/kg/h may be administered as a constant-rate infusion (CRI). The dose is then titrated based on seizure control and sedation.80 Midazolam is water soluble and is a good choice for emergency treatment when a CRI is needed through a peripheral catheter or via intramuscular injection. Midazolam\u2019s T1/2 in dogs is 77 minutes.103 A dose of 0.07 to 0.2 mg/kg is recommended as an intravenous or intramuscular bolus for immediate seizure control and a dosage of 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg/h when given as a CRI. When a benzodiazepine has been used to stop the acute seizure, it is important to also administer a longer acting anticonvulsant to prevent further seizures.80\n",

            "text": "Therapeutic levels and toxic levels are guidelines extrapolated from people. These ranges are based on population statistics and may not accurately reflect whether an individual canine or feline patient is controlled. Nonetheless, they can be helpful in optimizing anticonvulsant therapy, assessing risk factors of therapy, and helping to gauge when a second anticonvulsant may be needed. Determining anticonvulsant levels is most beneficial when (1) a dose change is needed because of inadequate seizure control or toxicity. The formula (desired blood level/current blood level) times the current dose equals the newly recommended dose (2) A refractory patient becomes controlled, which allows the identification of a therapeutic level for that patient, provided the seizure disorder does not worsen. (3) The patient is sensitive to the toxic effects of the anticonvulsant (most commonly bromide). Obtaining a blood level as soon as clinical signs of toxicity abate identifies the toxic level for that patient. Evaluation of blood levels may not be important when patients are currently and historically well controlled and free of adverse effects. Patients receiving phenobarbital should ideally have a level obtained once they reach steady state given the risk of hepatotoxicity at levels greater than 35 \u03bcg/mL. In addition, serial phenobarbital levels every 6 to 12 months can be of benefit if hepatic metabolism changes. Peak and trough phenobarbital levels were recommended in the past. However, only 9% of patients receiving phenobarbital had a clinically significant (>30%) change between peak and trough levels in one study. Thus a single sample is typically sufficient.105 Identifying the timing of sample collection relative to dosing can be helpful when the level is in the high reference range so that toxicity can be avoided. Therapeutic levels for levetiracetam, zonisamide, and pregabalin are unknown for dogs at this time. Thus, routine monitoring of levels is typically not done with usage of these drugs. Bromide levels are affected by Cl\u2212. Increased dietary Cl\u2212 or intravenous fluids containing Cl\u2212 increase renal excretion of bromide and thus lower serum bromide levels. A patient receiving bromide therapy may lose seizure control as a result of a change in diet or intravenous fluids. In contrast, a decrease in dietary Cl\u2212 may lead to toxicity (sedation and ataxia) as renal bromide excretion is reduced and serum bromide levels subsequently increase. Thus, dietary changes should be minimized in patients receiving bromide therapy.",

If significant adverse effects are not apparent, then it is reasonable to add the additional drug while continuing the initial anticonvulsant at the maintenance dose. If the initial anticonvulsant drug is to be withdrawn it should be tapered over the course of several months because it is often difficult to definitively know how effective the initial drug was. Weaning the initial drug over several months may help prevent withdrawal seizures. If sedation or ataxia is noted with the addition of the new anticonvulsant, either drug may be tapered to limit adverse effects. If seizure control is successful without adverse effects, maintenance therapy with multiple drugs may be warranted and thus the initial drug may not be withdrawn. If a second or third drug is implemented because of adverse effects, tapering the drug with the most likely adverse effects is recommended. If adverse effects are of mild to moderate concern then tapering a drug such as phenobarbital may be done every 2 to 4 weeks by 25% each time. Potassium bromide may be reduced more quickly at times because of its longer T1/2. Rapid tapering or withdrawal is necessary when adjusting medications because of severe adverse effects from existing therapy. In this situation, the existing therapy should be stopped immediately or over the course of a few days. It is important to concurrently start another anticonvulsant with a shorter T1/2 so that steady state is rapidly achieved. Furthermore, the additional drug should have a different profile of adverse effects.",
