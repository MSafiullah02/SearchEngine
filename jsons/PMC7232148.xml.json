Influenza viruses are another group of respiratory viruses, which account for 300\u2013600 K deaths annually and represent an ever-present pandemic threat. Emergence of drug-resistant influenza strains is driving research into new anti-influenza drug candidates with different modes of action. In this issue, two papers report compounds with anti-influenza activity against a range of influenza A viruses that inhibit early steps in influenza replication not targeted by clinically approved anti-influenza drugs [1,2]. A further study reports that respiratory syncytial virus is inhibited in vitro and in vivo by natural product plant extracts in which phenolic glycoside acetoside was the active chemical component [3].

The special issue also includes a review of the current antiviral strategies against human CMV [14] and a more focused review by Adamson and Nevels, which argues the case for the development of novel anti-CMV compounds by targeting major immediate-early (IE) gene expression or protein function [15]. RNA viruses can also establish persistent infections and this issue includes a study investigating the acquisition of drug resistance to fluoxetine during treatment of pancreatic cell-lines persistently infected with coxsackievirus B4 [16].",
