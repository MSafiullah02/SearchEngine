However, privacy concerns often prevent multiple competitive organizations from sharing and integrating their patient training videos. In addition, patients with infectious or chronic diseases may not want the online patient training organizations to identify who they are or even which video clips they are interested in. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective techniques to protect both video content privacy and access privacy. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to construct a distributed Hippocratic video database system for supporting more profitable online patient training and counseling. First, a new database modeling approach is developed to support concept-oriented video database organization and assign a degree of privacy of the video content for each database level automatically. Second, a new algorithm is developed to protect the video content privacy at the level of individual video clip by filtering out the privacy-sensitive human objects automatically. In order to integrate the patient training videos from multiple competitive organizations for constructing a centralized video database indexing structure, a privacy-preserving video sharing scheme is developed to support privacy-preserving distributed classifier training and prevent the statistical inferences from the videos that are shared for cross-validation of video classifiers. Our experiments on largescale video databases have also provided very convincing results.",

Because increasing the amounts of available patient training videos and increasing the diversity of video content may result in better offerings for patient training, it is very attractive to integrate the patient training videos from multiple competitive organizations in the health care network. However, privacy regulations, consumer backlash, and other privacy concerns often prevent multiple competitive organizations from sharing their patient training videos [1] - [10] . In addition, patients with infectious or chronic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome, bird flu, hepatitis, and diabetes, may not want the professional patient trainers and organizations to identify who they are or even which video clips they are interested in because disclosing private disease information may seriously affect their employment opportunities. Such privacy concerns may prevent the patients from using online training systems for early detection and selftreatment of their life-threatening infectious and chronic diseases. Thus, there is a strong need of new techniques that are capable of protecting both access privacy and video content privacy. Unfortunately, no comprehensive framework is available today to address the following inter-related issues effectively.",

In order to learn the accurate concept models (i.e., video classifiers) for enabling a centralized indexing of the distributed video content, it is very important to support privacy-preserving video sharing among multiple competitive organizations. Many techniques have been proposed recently to support privacy-preserving data sharing and mining [16] - [26] . By randomizing the original data or adopting secure multiparty computation, these techniques can protect the data privacy at the individual level and the algorithms are still able to recover aggregate information or to build data mining models. Data perturbation can protect individual data records, but it may also result in information loss as well as in privacy breaches due to the disclosure of perturbed data [16] - [20] . On the other hand, secure multiparty computation (SMC) approaches are too expensive to be useful for large-scale video database because of high communication costs [21] - [26] . Thus, these existing methods cannot directly be extended to enable privacy-preserving video sharing for distributed classifier training.",

To address this issue, two approaches can be used to improve human object detection: a) human-system interaction can be involved for defining the regions of human objects interactively [14] ; and b) detection results for all the video frames within the same video shot are integrated and the relevant confidence maps for the detection results are calculated to provide a valuable information for human object detection as shown in Fig. 3 . The confidence region is generated by transforming the relevant confidences for our detection results into a binary image via thresholding. Our experimental results on automatic human object detection and tracking are shown in Fig. 4 . After the human objects are extracted, all the video clips are decomposed into a set of video shots with the associated human objects. It is well accepted that the visual properties of the videos are also important for video retrieval [9] , [14] , thus, both the global visual features and the local visual features are extracted for characterizing various visual properties of the semantic video concepts more precisely. In this paper, multiple feature subsets are extracted for video content representation: i) cumulative color histogram; ii) histogram of cumulative wavelet texture features; and iii) motion histogram.",

Thus, each party in the collaboration network can have full control on its privacy disclosure risks and its individual benefits for data sharing. To illustrate the empirical relationship between the misclassification rate and the number of synthetic support vectors to be shared, we have tested our algorithms on multiple machine learning datasets and our results are given in Fig. 8 . One can observe that sharing more synthetic support vectors can result in a complete SVM classifier with low-classification error rate. We have also obtained the empirical relationship between the privacy disclosure risk and the number of synthetic support vectors to be shared as shown in Fig. 9 . One can observe that the privacy disclosure risk sequentially decreases with the number of synthetic support vectors which are shared for approximating the underlying SVM decision boundaries interpreted by the original support vectors. When more synthetic support vectors are shared to approximate the underlying SVM decision boundaries, it becomes more difficult to identify the one-to-one relationships between the original support vectors and the synthetic support vectors. However, the privacy disclosure risk consists of three individual parts: re-identification risk, linkage disclosure risk, and confidentiality-interval inference risk. Sharing more synthetic support vectors may also increase the ability to predict the value intervals of the original support vectors (i.e., confidentiality-interval inference risk) and induce higher linkage disclosure risk [36] - [39] , and thus, we have also obtained a slight increasing of the privacy disclosure risk when more synthetic support vectors are shared as shown in Fig. 9 .",

For the high-level database nodes with low degree of privacy, it is very important to explicitly index the underlying contextual relationships between the parent node and its children nodes, so that higher access efficiency can be achieved for large-scale video database applications. Thus, the associated pointers can be used to index the higher-level database nodes when their degree of privacy S(l) is less than the threshold T \u03b4 , S(l) < T \u03b4 . Based on these observations, we have developed an effective technique to achieve a good balance between the access efficiency and the access privacy by selecting a suitable threshold T \u03b4 .

Our semi-private video retrieval technique may leak the patients' privacy when all these three conditions are reached simultaneously: 1) multiple queries for the same video concept are received from the same patient and these queries are recorded by the video providers; 2) these competitive video providers are collaborated (i.e., sharing the queries they received) to infer the patients' privacy; and 3) these competitive video providers know exactly who submitted the given query. When all these three conditions are reached simultaneously, these competitive video providers in the health care network can collaborate to infer the patients' query privacy. On the other hand, oblivious or history-independent database indexing structure can support private information retrieval [10]- [26] , but it is too expensive to be useful for real applications.

To evaluate our distributed framework for privacy preserving classifier training, the video set is partitioned into three individual groups and weak classifier training is first performed on these three individual data groups independently. The complete SVM classifier is then learned from the shared weak classifiers and the synthetic support vectors. One advantage of our distributed framework for privacy preserving classifier training is that it is able to control the privacy breaches by sharing different numbers of synthetic support vectors. Because these support vectors are used to approximate the decision boundaries of the complete SVM classifier for the given semantic video concept, sharing different number of support vectors can achieve different versions of the complete SVM classifier with different classification accuracy rates. Thus, a good balance between the disclosure of private information and the classification accuracy rate (i.e., depending on the quality of the complete SVM classifier) can be achieved effectively by sharing different resolutions of these weak classifiers. Based on this understanding, we have obtained the empirical relationships between the quality of the complete SVM classifier (i.e., precision of the complete SVM classifier) and the privacy disclosures as shown in Fig. 14. For three data sites, the total number of support vectors and the number of synthetic support vectors to be shared are given in Table I .",
