Its wavelength range (750 nm\u20131 mm) corresponds to energies that overlap the vibrational transitions in molecules. These transitions, in turn, provide a wealth of information about the sample in question \u2014 for example, couplings between vibrational modes due to proximity; frequency shifts caused by hydrogen bonding or the particular electrostatic properties of the environment; and the orientation of a particular group relative to the laboratory frame. This, together with the sensitivity of modern spectrometers makes Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy a popular tool for molecular analysis.",

The first is the water stretching and bending modes at ca. 3200\u20133700 cm\u22121 and 1600\u20131630 cm\u22121, respectively,1\nwhich dominate the IR spectra of any dilute biological sample. When studying water-soluble proteins, it is possible to overcome this problem partially through the use of highly concentrated specimens, short sample path lengths, and/or use of D2O. In contrast, membrane proteins are particularly suited for examination by FTIR spectroscopy. Here, water opacity is much less of a problem because the lipid bilayer is the dominant solvent of the protein. Hence, after the removal of bulk water, membrane proteins can readily be studied by FTIR in their native environment \u2014 the lipid membrane.",

            "text": "The second problem that limits the usefulness of IR spectroscopy as a tool for the structural study of biological macromolecules is spectral resolution. In other words, the width of a single vibrational mode is often significantly larger than the differences between individual vibrations. Therefore, traditional IR spectroscopy yields information that pertains to the average properties of a protein or that which is obtained because of coupling between numerous modes. The advent of isotope editing in IR spectroscopy of proteins has alleviated this problem to an extent, because of the ability of isotopomers to shift the vibrational frequency to a \u2018transparent\u2019 region of the spectrum. If we assume that the vibrational mode between atoms a and b behaves as a harmonic oscillator, its frequency, wa,b will change upon isotope editing of atom a to c and b to d as follows:wa,bwc,d=mamb(mc+md)mcmd(ma+mb)whereby m\na, m\nb, m\nc and m\nd are the masses of atoms a, b, c and d. Atoms a \u2194 c and b \u2194 d are isotopomeric pairs.",

            "text": "Note that the above equation indicates that the frequency shift is highly dependent on relative, not absolute, mass change. For example, the amide A vibrational mode (mostly the N\u2014H stretch) at ca. 3300 cm\u22121 will shift \u2212890 cm\u22121 upon deuteration (14N\u2014\n1H \u2192 \n14N\u2014\n2H) but only \u22127 cm\u22121 upon isotope labeling of the nitrogen (14N\u2014\n1H \u2192 \n15N\u2014\n1H). This is due to a relative change of 100% with regard to the hydrogen atom mass in the first case, versus a relative change of 7% with regard to the nitrogen atom mass, in the second case. Thus, because of its ability to isolate an individual vibration, isotope-edited FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can yield precise information regarding the labeled site. Moreover, it does so with minimal interference, because isotopomeric species are normally completely silent with respect to the chemical nature (e.g., structural perturbation) of the examined protein.",

Barry and co-workers [13\u2022\u2022], on the other hand, have analyzed a significantly larger protein: the lactose permease (LacY), which contains 417 amino acid residues. The authors performed a \u2018reaction-induced difference FTIR\u2019, in which a reaction is initiated by changing the sample conditions and the resulting difference in the FTIR spectra is recorded. By using LacY uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N the authors were able to assign peaks in the difference spectra at 1765\u20131730 cm\u22121 to carboxylic groups as well as to assign additional spectral features to contributions of other side chain moieties such as lysine, arginine, histidine and the amidic residues.

In analyzing the transmembrane helical bundle formed by the T-cell receptor CD3-\u03b6 component, the authors employed 11 different peptides, each containing a 13C\n18O label in a unique position. The site-specific dichroism for each of the peptides was used to derive an orientational restraint for each of the respective carbonyl groups. These restraints were then implemented as orientational refinement energy terms in molecular dynamics simulations, leading to a structure for the protein complex that correlated well with evolutionary conservation information [28]. The data were sufficiently accurate to detect a kink in the transmembrane helices that resulted in asymmetrical water accessibility to the amino and carboxy termini of the helical bundle. This pattern of water accessibility was later confirmed by 2D IR studies, as elaborated below [29\u2022\u2022].",

The study employed two different peptides, corresponding to the dimeric and the (mutant) monomeric transmembrane domains of the human glycophorin A [32]. Gly79 was exchanged for a glycine in which the two C\u03b1 hydrogens were replaced with deuteriums. This enabled the authors to selectively measure the glycine CD2 stretching frequency and to determine the effects of hydrogen bond formation thereupon. The results of the study show a 6 cm\u22121 difference between the peak of the monomeric and the dimeric glycine CD2 stretching mode, indicating that in the dimeric form the methylene group is hydrogen bonded to the CO group in the opposing helix, as predicted [31].

However, two recent studies from the Zanni group on the transmembrane domain of CD3-\u03b6 demonstrate the promise that the approach possesses. In the first study of a membrane protein by 2D IR [39\u2022\u2022] the authors measured the homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths of the single 13C\n18O labled site and compared that with the entire peptide amide I (arising from the 12C\n16O modes). This study was later extended to 11 different 13C\n18O residues along the entire length of the transmembrane peptide [29\u2022\u2022]. The analysis pointed to the fact that although all sites exhibit the same homogeneous broadening, they differed substantially in their inhomogeneous linewidths. Comparison of experiments with simulations indicate water accessibility of the protein backbone as the primary cause that affects the dynamical behavior of the different sites. The differential water accessibility correlated well with the structural model of the protein [27\u2022\u2022].",

However, in numerous membrane proteins, large aqueous cavities and vestibules result in many of the residues in the transmembrane helices undergoing H+/D+ exchange as well. Lancaster and co-workers [41\u2022] have recently studied Wolinella succinogenes quinol:fumarate reductase focusing on the role of a key carboxylic residue (Glu-C180) in the function of the protein. Usng site-directed mutagenesis along with H+/D+ exchange the authors were able to show that Glu-C180, located in the transmembrane segment of the protein, undergoes protonation and deprotonation as evidenced by peak changes at 1733\u20131741 cm\u22121. Goormaghtigh and co-workers [40\u2022\u2022] used H+/D+ exchange to study structural dynamics in the gastric H+,K+ ATPase. In their analysis, using attenuated total internal reflection spectroscopy, the authors showed that the H+/D+ exchange kinetics are intimately correlated with the molecular movements of the protein. Because these movements may be correlated with the catalytic cycle of the protein, they provide insight into the kinetics and structural transitions that the enzyme undergoes.",

One obvious limitation that must be considered is the ability to label the target protein. Two categories of proteins should therefore be considered for FTIR analysis: those that can, and those that cannot be made synthetically. Inserting a label into a synthetic protein is trivial \u2014 it is simply introduced at will during the synthesis. The problem with this approach is that \u2018straight-forward\u2019 chemical synthesis is limited to proteins smaller than 60\u201370 residues. However, chemical ligation can be used to extend this upper limit significantly [43], as shown by the recent total synthesis of functional mechanosensitive channels from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, containing 136 and 151 residues, respectively [44\u2022\u2022]. Isotopic labeling of proteins that cannot be made synthetically is much more of a challenge. Approaches that have been used to address this technical obstacle are metabolic labeling of unique amino acids [35\u2022, 36\u2022, 37\u2022\u2022] and tRNA engineering [45, 46].",
