However, some viruses replicate in the skin to produce local lesions, after entry through minor abrasions or by artificial puncture (Table 7-1\n). Several poxviruses\u2014e.g., cowpox, orf, and fowlpox, and the papillomaviruses\u2014cause local skin lesions. The most efficient way by which viruses are introduced through the skin is by the bite of an arthropod vector, such as a mosquito, tick, sandfly, or Culicoides. Such insects may be mechanical vectors (e.g., for myxomatosis and fowlpox), but most viruses introduced in this way replicate in the vector. Viruses that are transmitted by and replicate in arthropod vectors are called arboviruses, a term that carries no taxonomic implications. Infection can be acquired through the bite of an animal, as in rabies. Finally, introduction of a virus by skin penetration may be iatrogenic\u2014the result of human intervention, e.g., transmission, of equine infectious anemia by a contaminated needle. Generalized infection of the skin (exanthema), such as is found in lumpyskin disease, sheeppox, and swine vesicular disease, for example, is due to viral spread via the bloodstream.",

Bovine, porcine, and murine coronaviruses are protected by the buffering capacity of milk during passage through the stomach of young animals, and avian influenza viruses are assisted by the buffering capacity of food to survive passage through the upper digestive tract of birds.

Infection spreads by sequential infection of neighboring cells. Papillomaviruses initiate infection in the basal layer of the epidermis, but maturation, with the production of virions, occurs only when the cells become keratinized as they move toward the skin surface. Since this is a slow process, taking several weeks, warts have a long incubation period. Many poxviruses produce infection via the skin. In contrast to the papillomaviruses, however, there is also subepithelial and lymphatic spread. In infection with vaccinia virus, which may become as common for domestic animals as it used to be in humans if vaccinia is used as a vector for veterinary vaccines (see Chapter 14), a few epidermal cells are infected by scarification and virus spreads locally from cell to cell, primarily in the epidermis, before spreading to the local lymph nodes. Some poxviruses, e.g., orf, rabbit fibroma, and Yaba poxvirus, remain localized in the skin and produce a proliferative response and a localized tumor.",

After infections of the respiratory tract by paramyxoviruses and influenza virus, or the intestinal tract by rotaviruses or coronaviruses, there is little or no invasion beyond the epithelium. Although these viruses usually enter the lymphatics and thus have the potential to spread, they do not appear to replicate in the deeper tissues, possibly because the appropriate virus receptors are restricted to epithelial cells. However, restriction to an epithelial surface cannot be equated with lack of severity of clinical disease. Large areas of intestinal epithelium may be damaged by rotaviruses or coronaviruses, for example, causing severe diarrhea. The severity of localized infections of the respiratory tract depends on their location: infections of the upper respiratory tract may produce severe rhinitis but few other signs; infection of the bronchioles or alveoli produces more severe respiratory distress and may predispose to secondary bacterial invasion.",

These very efficient phagocytes are present in all compartments of the body, in alveoli, subepithelial tissues, sinusoids of the lymph nodes, free in plasma, and above all in the sinusoids of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The kinds of interactions that may occur between macrophages and virions can be described in relation to those found in the sinusoids of the liver, the Kupffer cells (Fig. 7-4\n; the numbers in the list refer to the circled numbers in this diagram).1.Virions may resist phagocytosis by macrophages. This occurs in Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection, and is a factor that favors prolonged viremia.2.Virions may be phagocytosed and destroyed. This is the usual fate of picornaviruses that circulate in the plasma. Since the macrophage system is so efficient, viremia with such viruses can be maintained only if virions enter the blood as fast as they are removed.3.Virions may be phagocytosed and then passively transferred to adjacent cells (hepatocytes in the liver). If the virus cannot replicate in hepatocytes the situation resembles (2) above; if, like Rift Valley fever virus, the virus replicates in these cells it can cause clinical hepatitis and the virus produced in the liver can sustain a high level of viremia.4.Virions may be phagocytosed by macrophages and then replicate in them. With some viruses, such as lactic dehydrogenase virus in mice, only macrophages are infected [Fig. 7-4 (4A)] and progeny virions enhance the viremia, which reaches an extremely high level. More commonly [Fig. 7-4 (4B)], as in infectious canine hepatitis, virus replicates in both macrophages and hepatic cells, producing severe hepatitis.\n",

Primary involvement of the epidermis or separation of epidermis from dermis by fluid pressure results in vesiculation. Erosion or sloughing of the epithelium results in ulceration and scabbing, but prior to ulceration a vesicle may be converted to a pustule by cellular infiltration.

Rabies virus also travels to the central nervous system in axon cytoplasm, but usually does not infect the nerve sheath. Sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves may be involved in the neural spread of these viruses. Rabies and some togaviruses are able to use the olfactory nerve for movement to the central nervous system; they can infect olfactory neuroepithelial cells, which are exposed in the epithelium of the nares and have their axonal endings in the olfactory bulb of the brain.",

The cause of clinical neurological signs in other central nervous system infections is more obscure. Rabies virus infection is noncytocidal; it evokes little of the inflammatory reaction or cell necrosis found in other encephalitides, yet it is highly lethal for most mammalian species. With certain other viruses, infection of neurons causes no clinical signs; for example, the extensive central nervous system infection of mice congenitally infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which is readily demonstrable by fluorescent-antibody staining, has no recognizable deleterious effect. Still other pathological changes are produced by some of the viruses that cause slowly progressive diseases of the central nervous system (see Chapter 11). In scrapie of sheep, for example, there is slow neuronal degeneration and vacuolization; in visna (a chronic retrovirus infection of sheep), changes in glial cell membranes lead to demyelination.",
