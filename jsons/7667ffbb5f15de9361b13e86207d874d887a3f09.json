Medical records of 19,039 patients, admitted from June 6, 2010, up to and including April 15, 2017, were analyzed for all modes of artificial (invasive and noninvasive) ventilation within 48 h of admission. Clinical data were primarily retrieved from the patient data management system (PDMS) (Metavision, iMDsoft, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany), while personal information (e.g., smoking status) was retrieved from other medical records. Our study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Antwerp/Antwerp University Hospital (AIRPOLLUTIC trial, 17/12/162). A total of 3191 patients were mechanically ventilated within the first 48 h of admission for the duration of at least 48 h. After exclusion of patients living outside of Belgium (n = 512), removal of patients with no data on smoking status (n = 414) and elimination of children (< age 18 years) (n = 262), our final study population comprised 2003 patients (Fig. 1) .",

Alternatively, we excluded patients coming from another hospital ICU to account for possible exposure misclassification (resulting in n = 1755). In another secondary analysis, we accounted for possible confounding due to respiratory comorbidities by excluding all patients with preexisting lung disease including COPD and asthma (resulting in n = 1672) and by excluding all patients with preexisting respiratory and neuromuscular comorbidities (n = 1463). We then further restricted the study population to patients who left the ICU alive (n = 1027) to account for early death.

For an IQR higher air pollution exposure up to 10 days before admission, the duration of ventilation was estimated to be 7.8-12.4% longer. Our data were obtained in a large and diverse ICU population, and the relationship between air pollution exposure and duration of ventilation was shown irrespective of preexisting lung disease or ICU admission diagnosis. It has been shown that medical and sociodemographic characteristics [8, 10, 17] already present prior to ICU admission contribute to the occurrence and severity of organ failure including respiratory failure as well as the outcome in the critically ill. However, pre-admission environmental factors have hardly been studied in this context, or studies have found no effect (i.e., sunlight exposure prior to ICU admission has been found not to influence the incidence of ICU-acquired delirium) [18] . We are the first to report on the effect of pre-admission air pollution exposure on the duration of mechanical ventilation. The findings of this study are of critical public health importance because of the ubiquity of ambient air pollution. Short-term ambient particulate air pollution is independently associated with daily all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality [19, 20] . As such, air pollution has important molecular and physiological effects on the lung, an organ frequently failing in the critically ill. A few recent studies have demonstrated some effects of air pollution on the occurrence of (only) the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated mortality. Long-term ozone and PM 2.5 exposure are associated with an increased risk for ARDS among older adults in the USA [21] and in patients at risk for ARDS (e.g., trauma patient, active smoker) [22] . Rush et al. [23] described how chronic exposure to high levels of ozone and PM results in higher mortality rates in ARDS patients, and most recently, Reilly et al. [24] added long-term exposure to low to moderate levels of sulfur dioxide, NO 2 and carbon monoxide to the risk factors for ARDS in trauma patients.",

Significant associations were observed for lag0, representing the day of ICU admission, but positive estimates (close to significance for BC and PM 2.5 ) were also observed for lag1. A similar lagged pattern (lag0 and lag1) has been shown in a recent study investigating the association between the short-term effect of ambient air pollution (PM 1 and PM 2.5 ) and hospital admission for respiratory diseases [25] . The mechanism of this lagged pattern is not completely understood, but (pulmonary and/or systemic) oxidative stress and inflammation might be plausible biological mechanisms. For example, in a prospective panel study, increased blood levels of C-reactive protein and ICAM-1 were observed for an increase in PM 10 and ultrafine particles with a delay of 1-2 days [26] . In 3996 individuals of the Framingham Heart Study, elevated exposure to relatively low levels of ambient air pollution for a few days was associated with higher levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation (including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2) [27] . Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that acute air pollution-induced inflammation processes occur, at least in the lung, since this is the primary site of inflammation. The effects of air pollutants on the lung originate from extracellular activation of the inflammatory response and/or oxidative stress-mediated inflammation in airway epithelial cells [28] .",

Indeed, duration of ventilation-related conditions such as cognitive impairment, depression, neuro-myopathy and pulmonary function alterations (e.g., reduced diffusion capacity) can persist in the ICU survivor, resulting in a long-term need of medical, psychological and/or physiotherapeutic care, causing considerable economic burden [32, 33] . Our data thus represent a novel and potentially modifiable environmental risk factor, which, if improved, will not only ameliorate the post-ICU quality of life but might also reduce health care costs. The incentive to \"clear the air\" will gain even more importance in the future, considering the projected increase in an aging [34] population who are even more at risk for air pollution-related respiratory diseases due to an age-related defective mucociliary function in combination with decreased muscle strength, compromising the ability to clear inhaled particles [35, 36] .",

Although we used validated exposure models, there might be some exposure misclassification. For example, we interpolated daily exposure levels at the residence without taking the amount of exposure at the address of employment or the time spent indoors into account. However, considering the higher age and expected preexisting health problems in our study population, we may assume that a considerable portion of time before admission was spent at the home address. Furthermore, a number of patients had been admitted to our hospital some days before ICU admission, thus generating some exposure misclassification. However, it is reasonable to assume that the exposure misclassification is random, resulting in an underestimation of effect estimates [37, 38] . Moreover, our findings stayed robust after accounting for possible exposure misclassification and excluding patients coming from another hospital ICU. In terms of validity of the exposure model, we showed that the estimated long-term residential exposure correlates with the internal nanosized carbon load in urine [39] .",

Any differences in duration of ventilation are therefore not attributable to physician-specific particularities, but a priori to (preexistent) patient characteristics. Additionally, our findings were robust after adjusting for APACHE IV, excluding all patients with preexisting lung disease (COPD and asthma) or other comorbidities and even after excluding the patients that died in the ICU to account for the competing risk of early mortality. Thirdly, due to patient heterogeneity in the intensive care and random exposure misclassification-which cannot be ruled out in epidemiology-we observed relatively wide confidence intervals around our estimates. Finally, we could not retrieve information on socioeconomic status (SES). Although SES is important in long-term exposure outcomes, it is less likely to be an important confounder in acute exposure studies as no relation between shortterm temporal differences in air pollution exposure and SES is expected.",
