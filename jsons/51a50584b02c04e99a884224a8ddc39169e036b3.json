            "text": "Otitis media (OM) comprises a wide spectrum of diseases that include acute otitis media (AOM), recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) [1] [2] [3] . AOM is an acute inflammation and infection of the middle ear caused by bacteria and/or viruses. In general, it is a childhood disease that manifests as a rapid onset of fever and otalgia [1, 2, 4] ; if the child has \u22653 episodes of AOM in the preceding 6 months, or \u22654 episodes in the preceding 12 months, he should be considered to have rAOM [1, 5, 6] . Patients who have more than six episodes in the first 6 years of life are called otitis \"prone\" [7] . The presence of fluid in the middle ear with absence of acute signs and symptoms of infection and inflammation is defined as OME, and if the fluid persisted more than 3 months, it is considered as COME [1] . CSOM is defined as an ear discharge with tympanic membrane (TM) perforation for more than 3 months [1] .",

AOM is related to upper respiratory infections (URTI): More than 90% of AOM episodes develop after URTI [1, 7] ; one of three children will develop AOM after URTI [12] . URTI causes nasopharyngitis which affects Eustachian tube function, and induces a negative pressure in the middle ear with secondary suction of the nasopharyngeal secretions inside the middle ear. This explains why aspirates of AOM can show bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis [2, 9] , which are commensal to the nasopharynx [13] . This mechanism is exaggerated by bottle-feeding, pacifier use, and other sucking behaviors. The initial course of the disease is thought to be of viral origin followed by superimposed bacterial infections [2, 12] . Many viruses have been implicated as causative agents which are found in 90% of AOM cases, such as the rhinovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza type 1, 2 or 3, influenza A or B, and adenovirus [1, 2, 7, 8, 14] . Among all of these, RSV is believed to have the most frequent association with AOM [12] . These viruses are thought to increase the adherence of the bacteria to the epithelium so enhancing bacterial colonization [12, 14] , however, there is a rising evidence that viruses alone can cause AOM without bacterial superinfection in 10-15% of cases, a point that should be kept in mind while treating AOM with antibiotics [12, 14] .",

One cohort study showed that heritability is found in 38.5% in rAOM [11] . Some investigators have linked this susceptibility to inherited poor ET function [2] . Other investigators found that specific polymorphisms of some cytokines have been correlated to the susceptibility of an individual to AOM and to the severity of the disease as well [10, 12] . IL-1s, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 have been found in nasopharyngeal secretions during URTI and increased levels of IL-1s are linked to the transition to AOM [12] . TNF\u03b1-308 polymorphisms are associated with AOM that follows URTI. In addition, some rAOM patients were found to have TNF\u03b1-308 and IL-6-174 polymorphisms [12] . Genes for Fcg-receptor IIa (FcgRIIa), IL-10, CD14, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), surfactant, and interferon gamma (IFNg) are believed to be responsible for an AOM risk [11] .",

Under these circumstance, prevention of further attacks is desirable. Modification of risk factors, when possible, are of benefit. Breast feeding has a protective effect at least for the first 6 months and preferentially to be continued for the first year [5] . Elimination of smoking from the environment and avoidance of pacifiers have been shown to help reduce the recurrence of AOM. Vaccinations are other preventive measures [3, 5, 7, 26] . PCV7 has been shown to decrease AOM rates and tympanostomy tube placement for recurrent diseases [26] and is more effective if given during infancy [6] . It can prevent the early episodes of the disease and prevent the mucosal changes, that make the ear more susceptible to infection by other S. pneumoniae serotypes, that are not covered by PCV [19] . Some studies found that Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) has decreased the incidence of AOM by 12.4%, if given between 6 and 71 months of age [7] , but others found influenza vaccine is not effective in preventing AOM [6] . The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and influenza vaccine for all children [5] . Despite promising results, there is still a real concern about the long-term benefit from vaccination. A recent study has highlighted concerns regarding the increasing incidence of AOM-related complications. Following the introduction of vaccinations, AOM-related complications, including mastoiditis and other intracranial complications, diminished considerably, however, they returned to pre-vaccination levels after a few years [27] . Antibiotic prophylaxis has only minimal effects on recurrent otitis media, decreasing recurrence by approximately one episode per year. Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended in the management of rAOM.",
