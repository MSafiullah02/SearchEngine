These viral infections had a major impact on intensive care and are described in Chap. 20 . This chapter is dedicated to describing outbreaks caused by bacteria and fungi, with references to secondary infections associated with flu and SARS [1, 2] . The second publication concerns the ''International Study of the Prevalence and Outcomes of Infection in Intensive Care Units'' published in December 2009 [3] .

Indeed, the above-mentioned point-prevalence study was conducted on 8 May 2007 but published in December 2009 [3] . Therefore, for accuracy, this analysis indicates when outbreaks actually happened and when they were subsequently published. Acinetobacter outbreaks were selected to illustrate this point ( Fig. 12.1 ). In addition to the reported outbreaks, a number of publications considered many relevant aspects of infection and outbreaks in ICU. Some of these are included in this chapter. We analysed 97 publications, the majority of which met the definition of an outbreak in neonatal (NICU), paediatric (PICU) and adult (AICU) ICUs and reported since 2000.

Reports of two outbreaks were published in 2002 and three in 2004, all occurring between 1997 and 2000. One report published in 2007 did not report the actual time of the outbreak. These outbreaks are summarised briefly according to their countries of origin. A paper from Italy published in 2002 reported a unique experience of controlling a MRSA outbreak of 8 months' duration in a medical/surgical AICU in 1998 using enterally administered vancomycin in mechanically ventilated patients [5] . Another report from Italy, published in 2004, described the identification of a variant of the ''Rome clone'' of MRSA responsible for an outbreak in a cardiac surgery ICU, which occurred in 1999 in a hospital in Rome. This strain had decreased sensitivity to vancomycin and was resistant to many antibiotics [6] . A study from Germany published in 2002 described the occurrence of MRSA in ICU in terms of endemic and epidemic infections followed from January 1997 to June 2000.This study involved 139 ICUs, 51 of which (37%) had MRSA infections. Outbreaks (three or more MRSA infections within 3 months) were registered in 13 ICUs, clusters (two MRSA infections within 3 months) in further 12 units and single events in 26 [7] . A publication from Spain showed that enterally administered vancomycin can control endemic MRSA in ICUs without promoting VRE. This study was carried out over a 49-month period from July 1996 to 2000 and published in 2004 [8] . In 2007, a report from Canada presented a recent outbreak of MRSA carriage in an animal ICU. This finding appears important, as the strain responsible for the animal outbreak was indistinguishable from a strain in humans commonly isolated in Canada and the USA. Infection control measures, including active surveillance of all animals in the ICU, were used to control the outbreak. As transmission of MRSA within the unit occurred without infections and did not persist for a prolonged period of time, staff screening was surprisingly not initiated [9] .

We selected seven reports and summarised them according to the countries of origin and time of events and publishing. A paper from Pakistan published in 2002 was the country's first experience with a vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium outbreak in the ICU and NICU. The outbreak occurred in 2002, lasted 1 month and all but one isolate was of a single clone [11] . All isolates were resistant to gentamicin, ampicillin and tetracycline but sensitive to chloramphenicol. Six patients were colonised and four infected, with positive blood cultures; two of each died before specific therapy could be started (50% mortality rate). In 2005, a report from Italy described an outbreak of VRE colonisation and infection in an ICU that lasted 16 months (2001-2002) [12] . Fifty-six patients were colonised by E. faecium, and E. faecalis was detected in only two cases. Because of the low pathogenicity of VRE, the authors questioned whether it was worthwhile to have a specific VRE surveillance programme. For the 2004 Lowbury lecture, Pearman reported the Australian experience with VRE, which he described as ''from disaster to ongoing control''. This was the first outbreak of VRE, which was caused by E. faecium in an ICU and hospital wards and lasted 5 months in 2001. A vigilant VRE control programme prevented the epidemic strain from becoming endemic in the hospital [13] . An outbreak due to glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) in an ICU with simultaneous circulation of two different clones was reported from France in 2008. The outbreak lasted several months in 2003 without infections, but the significant colonisation caused organisational problems in the ICU [14] . An outbreak of VRE in an ICU was reported from China in 2009. The outbreak was caused by E. faecium and lasted 11 months (2006-2007) . A detailed molecular analysis showed that genetically unrelated isolates had transferred vancomycin resistance by conjugation [15] . A paper from Korea reported an outbreak of VRE in a neurological ICU. VRE was mainly isolated from urine specimens associated with the presence of a Foley catheter. Of 52 patients colonised with VRE, only two had active infection [16] . In 2009, a report from Spain presented an outbreak of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis in an ICU and reanimation unit [17] . This was the first report of a clonal outbreak of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis in Spain. The strain was sensitive to imipenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin and rifampicin. Most patients were exposed to linezolid within a year (2005) (2006) . The use of linezolid began in 2002. The increase in its use continued until 2005 when a mutant was identified by molecular analysis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 547, "end": 551, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 923, "end": 944, "text": "16 months (2001-2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 945, "end": 949, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1559, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1862, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1997, "text": "11 months (2006-2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2126, "end": 2130, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2363, "end": 2367, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2491, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2718, "end": 2724, "text": "(2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2725, "end": 2731, "text": "(2006)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Enterococcal Outbreaks"}, {"text": "Fourteen reports on outbreaks were retrieved since 2000.

According to the authors, this type of Klebsiella was not reported previously in Spain. Another clone harbouring two different genes responsible for multidrug resistance but dissimilar from the above was reported. A report from The Netherlands published in 2001 described an outbreak of infections with a multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella strain [19] associated with contaminated roll boards in operating rooms. This outbreak in 2000 showed how an unusual source of the outbreak can be revealed by systematic surveillance. In 2008, a polyclonal outbreak of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae in an ICU of a university hospital in Belgium was reported [20] . This was a 2-month outbreak that occurred in 2005 with 18 isolates. There was one predominant clone, two clones with several isolates and four with unique isolates.

Two epidemic clones were detected from the surfaces of an ICU room, but an original source was not identified. The outbreak was stopped by routine infection-control measures. A report from Malaysia in 2004 described an outbreak of Serratia infections that lasted 10 days in an AICU [23] . The single outbreak strain was found in insulin and sedative solutions administered to patients. An outbreak of S. marcescens colonisation and infection in a neurological ICU that occurred from May 2002 to March 2003 was reported from a Dutch university medical centre in 2006 [24] . The outbreak strain was traced to a healthcare worker (HCW) with longterm carriage on the hands. The skin of the HCW's hands was psoriatic. The epidemic ended after the colonised HCW went on leave, with subsequent eradication treatment. A heterogeneous outbreak of E. cloacae and S. marcescens infections in a surgical ICU was published by a group of authors from San Francisco, USA [25] . The outbreak lasted from December 1997 through January 1998. Molecular techniques ruled out a point source or significant cross-contamination as modes of transmission.

The outbreak occurred from December 1999 to September 2000, was monoclonal and the strain was introduced into the ICU early in 1998 and was maintained thereafter. All patients were ventilated. The strain was resistant to carbapenems, quinolones and azlocillin. In 13 infected patients, ten of whom died, Pseudomonas was found in one or all specimens, such as respiratory secretions, ventilator tubes, connection tubes and the water catcher of the ventilator system. The bacterium was also isolated from water taps. In addition to enhanced control of infection measures, complete elimination of the outbreak was achieved after water taps were pasteurised and sterile water was used when a solvent was needed. In 2003, French authors published a report on the epidemiology of P. aeruginosa in an ICU [27] . Although between 1996 and 1997 the prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections reached 30% of all hospital-acquired infections, the authors did not call this an outbreak, despite the fact that this was twice the national prevalence of 15% observed in ICUs. However, this high prevalence prompted the authors to conduct a prospective epidemiological study from July 1997 to February 1998. We selected this study as a good example of activities necessary to prevent a major outbreak. The authors described how systematic surveillance was carried out (oropharyngeal and rectal swabs on admission and twice weekly afterwards). This practice revealed that during the study period, the overall incidence of P. aeruginosa carriage was 43%: 17% on admission and 26% acquired in the ICU. In addition 16/191 (8%) patients developed the infection. The authors also pointed out that intestinal carriage was a prerequisite for colonisation or infection. Genotyping analysis of 81 isolates indicated that 70% belonged to genotype 1, 4% to genotype 2 and that remaining isolates were not genetically related. It has also been shown that mechanical ventilation was associated with P. aeruginosa carriage and ineffective antibiotics significantly increased the risk of colonisation and infection in ICU. The authors concluded that not only do endogenous sources account for the majority of colonisation or infection due to P. aeruginosa but that exogenous sources may be involved in some instances. In an epidemic setting, the authors' stance was to reinforce standard barrier precautions. However, the main message of this study is the necessity to adopt and pursue preventive measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 138, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 939, "end": 943, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pseudomonas Outbreaks"}, {"text": "In 2008, an outbreak of severe B. cepacia infections in an ICU was reported from Spain [28] .

Samples of antiseptics, eau de cologne and moisturising milk available on treatment carts were collected and cultured. B. cepacia was isolated not only from three samples of the moisturising body milk that had been applied to the patients but also from two new hermetically closed units. All strains recovered from environmental and clinical samples belonged to the same clone. The cream was withdrawn from all hospital units, and no new cases of B. cepacia developed.

From 6 June to 15 July 2000, six cases were identified. All patients received parenterally administered solutions prepared by ICU nurses, which was subsequently proven to be the source of infection. Three patients died from sepsis despite treatment with a combination of meropenem and amikacin, which were shown by laboratory tests to be synergistic. This high mortality rate (50%) was explained by the authors as being due to persistent bacteraemia related to the repeated infusions of contaminated solutions. Once aseptic preparation was carried out in the hospital pharmacy, this outbreak was controlled, and further infusion-related nosocomial bacteraemia was prevented. From the USA, a publication in 2001 reported an outbreak of multiresistant Acinetobacter colonisation and infection in an ICU [30] . The strain was sensitive only to polymyxin. The outbreak lasted an entire year between 1996 and 1997 and involved 57 patients, 27 of whom were infected and 25 colonised. The arrival of a colonised burn patient ([50% total body surface area) from an outside hospital was responsible for the outbreak. Although on typing two strains were found, the only identified primary source was the original burn patient. Ten deaths resulted from infections (37% of infected patients). The authors claimed that this outbreak served as a model of eradication of multi-drug-resistant organisms, as the Acinetobacter was eliminated from all ICU patients by multidisciplinary measures that included the following: cohort and contact isolation of all colonised and infected patients; introduction of strict aseptic measures such as hand washing, barrier isolation, equipment and room cleaning; sterilisation of ventilator equipment; and individual dedication of medical equipment to each patient. A paper was published from Australia in 2007 regarding carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii [31] . We selected this publication as an illustration of an extensive molecular analysis rather than for a critical review of the outbreak, which occurred in an ICU between 1999 and 2000. Based on their findings, the authors claim that antibiotic-resistant genes are readily exchanged between co-circulating strains in epidemics of phenotypically indistinguishable organisms. In conclusion, they recommend that epidemiological investigation of major outbreaks should include whole-genome typing as well as analysis of potentially transmissible genes and their vehicles. Finally, we found a paper in a journal from Kuwait not found by our Internet research [32] . The authors reported three different outbreaks of multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections involving 24 patients aged 16-75 years that occurred in an ICU in the course of 1 year between 2006 and 2007. The outbreak was polyclonal and successfully controlled with tigecycline, to which two causative clones were sensitive. Three additional distinct clones were isolated from the environment. Due to lack of appropriate surveillance cultures, no explanation was offered for the origin of epidemic clones.

The introduction of strict hygienic measures stopped the spread of infection, but the outbreak ceased with the introduction of a new batch of cotton from another manufacturer, which was used for venipuncture-site disinfection.

There are two different types of infection involved in outbreaks: secondary endogenous and exogenous. Outbreaks of secondary endogenous infections are invariably preceded by outbreaks of carriage of abnormal flora, whereas outbreaks of exogenous infections are not preceded by outbreaks of abnormal carriage. These two types of outbreaks each require a different type of management: enterally and topically administered antimicrobials for secondary endogenous and exogenous outbreaks, respectively. Ongoing surveillance efforts, i.e. throat and rectal swabs on admission and twice weekly thereafter, to monitor the efficacy of systematic decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) and to identify the emergence of antimicrobial resistant threats, is an intrinsic component of any decontamination programme. In this sense, a well-designed programme contains an intrinsic degree of protection against antibiotic-resistant organism emergence. Surveillance cultures of throat and rectum are more sensitive in detecting resistance than are diagnostic samples [41] . Additionally, there is a close relationship between surveillance and diagnostic samples. Once a resistant microorganism reaches overgrowth concentrations, i.e. C10 5 /ml saliva and/or gram of faeces, diagnostic samples become positive [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1541, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our review, 28 outbreaks were selected to illustrate the situation at the beginning of this century.

If we take MRSA as an example, all around the world, this drug-resistant pathogen has been a primary focus for nosocomial infection control and treatment for years. Thus, there are fewer outbreaks. An extensive study from Germany that involved 139 ICUs showed that cluster and single MRSA infections were significantly more common than actual outbreaks (38 ICUs compared with 12, respectively) [7] .

There was a significant increase in the rate of MRSA and Candida spp. acquisition in an ICU during the SARS period. It may be anticipated, therefore, that in the future, SARS and influenza viral infections would lead to complex ICU outbreaks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 300, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 127, "text": "(Table 12.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We pointed out earlier how using molecular techniques revealed that many outbreaks were due to more than one clone [4] . Our analysis confirms this, although the origin of different clones remained obscure in all reports in which polyclonality was detected. However, we recently put forward a hypothesis that microbial gut overgrowth is responsible for increased spontaneous mutation leading to polyclonality and antibiotic resistance [42] . Furthermore, extensive use of molecular techniques not only revealed a number of new genes responsible for antibiotic resistance [18] but showed that genetically unrelated organisms readily exchange antibiotic resistance genes [15, 31] . Yet further, a new trend is related to the SDD concept. Two studies, one from Italy and one from Spain, reported the use of enterally administered vancomycin to control and prevent, respectively, MRSA outbreaks [5, 8] . This is further evidence that the principle of SDD can be used with antimicrobials directed specifically to the causative organism. As early as 1993 we reported how selective decontamination with nystatin successfully controlled a Candida outbreak in an NICU [43] . Among older trends, surveillance cultures, or lack of them, are still prominent. Even in 2009 there were authors responsible for infection control in hospitals and ICUs who claimed that ''\u2026surveillance cultures of all patients with potential to develop infection are difficult and very costly\u2026'' [44] . Some time ago (1994), we expressed an alternative view in response to an identical attitude [45] . Needless to say, lack of surveillance cultures not only delays the recognition of an outbreak and its control but also precludes the understanding of the pathogenesis of the majority of outbreaks. Surveillance cultures are also crucial for detecting outbreaks of exogenous pathogenesis, i.e. without carriage. On the other hand, the source of an exogenous outbreak is readily identified with molecular techniques. Some of these outbreaks are striking, such as one from this analysis in which Acinetobacter-contaminated parentally administered solutions were repeatedly infused to patients, leading to a very high mortality rate of 50% [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 118, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 435, "end": 439, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 571, "end":
