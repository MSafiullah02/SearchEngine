Group A rotavirus ELISA indicated 12.9% positivity among patients and 2.5% positivity among controls. Only 23 of the 43 rotavirus ELISA-positive stools were also positive by electron microscopy. Nine children, three of whom were controls, were found to be shedding coronavirus-like particles, detected by electron microscopy. Stools from all but one of the nine children had been taken within 1 month of each other. Dot-blot hybridization tests for the presence of Ad40 or Ad41 DNA revealed 44 positive stools, 41 of which were from patients (13.2% positivity). Only three of the Ad40-or Ad41-positive stools by DNA hybridization were positive by electron microscopy, and only these three strains could be grown in semipermissive Chang conjunctival cells and their identity checked by restriction enzyme analysis. Further attempts to rescue the other strains using a helper virus failed, but nine of the stools proved positive by ELSA using a subgroup F-specific monoclonal antibody. On the basis of the DNA hybridization results alone, subgroup F adenoviruses were encountered as frequently as rotavirus in the study and were significantly associated with diarrhea, although the viability and intactness of virus particles by the time of laboratory analysis appeared to be very low.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Rotaviruses are widely accepted to be the most common viral cause of infantile gastroenteritis [Flewett et al., 1974; Kapikian and Chanock, 19851 and in developing countries, only enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli can rival rotavirus as an important etiologic agent of diarrhea [Du Pont, 19841 . Unlike rotavirus, the Norwalk agent appears to infect mainly school-age children and adults and is often associated with water-or food-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis [Kaplan et al., 19821 . The role of other viruses in causation of acute gastroenteritis is less clear.

This figure is almost twice that reported by Uhnoo et al. [1984] for a controlled study in Sweden, where the viruses were detected by EM, culture, and ELISA. If only patients are considered for whom subgroup F adenoviruses were the only potential pathogen detected in our study, the infection rate is then 6.1%, which is comparable to the figure of 7.2% found by Uhnoo et al. [19841. That only five specimens of 310 from patients (1.6%) were positive for adenoviruses by EM is unusual. Other workers have reported figures of 5-15% [Gary et al., 1979; Retter et al., 1979; Brandt et al., 19851 . Since only adenoviruses seen by EM in our study could be cultured, and none of the other ELISA positives showed evidence of viability, there is a possibility that the structural integrity of particles in the majority of cases did not survive shipment and storage. Another explanation relates to our recent finding that infection of Chang cells by Ad41 follows multiple-hit kinetics [Tiemessen and Kidd, in preparation] . Thus, successful infection requires a certain minimum virus concentration, and a dilute inoculum is not likely to cause cytopathic effects. This minimum required concentration may not have been achieved in stools, perhaps due to a combination of low virus output and adverse storage conditions. If this was the case, it is clear that the presence of another adenovirus, known to aid Ad41 replication normally [Tiemessen and Kidd, 19881 , did not improve infectivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 233, "text": "Uhnoo et al.

Hybridization is a relatively sensitive technique, being able to detect 10 pg or less of homologous viral DNA under ideal conditions [Kidd et al., 19851. Adenoviruses, in general, are known to produce an excess of structural protein components, which would be detected in stool by ELISA, but it is difficult to determine how much virus DNA (cell associated or particle associated) would be produced in stool relative to the stuctural proteins. Unfortunately, hybridization stands alone at the moment as a means of detecting adenovirus DNA in specimens, and there is no other technique with which to compare it.
