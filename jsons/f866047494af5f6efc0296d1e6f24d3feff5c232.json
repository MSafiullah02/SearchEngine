            "text": "Purpose of the study To evaluate the outcomes and complications using cemented megaprosthesis in elderly patients with distal femur nonunions (DFN). Materials and methods Between 2012 and 2016, 24 patients of DFN with an average age of 71.8 years (66-83) and an average 1.9(1-3) prior surgery was managed with distal femur replacement using cemented modular endoprosthesis. Outcomes were analysed on the following criteria: implant status, complications, knee range of motion, Knee Society Score (KSS) and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Results All patients were extremely satisfied with their outcomes. At an average 22.1 months (10-43) follow-up, patients had an average 69.5\u00b0(40\u00b0-110\u00b0) knee flexion, an average KSS of 75.7 (63-88) and an average MSTS score of 19.3 (17-25). Four patients died at an average 21.3 months after surgery due to causes unrelated to the fracture. One patient (4.1%) had implantrelated complication; deep infection which required debridement and intravenous antibiotics. There were no late amputations or peri-operative deaths and no patient had aseptic loosening of components. Conclusion By permitting immediate full weight-bearing ambulation and with most patients returning to an acceptable functional status, cemented megaprosthesis is a viable and useful single-stage management option in elderly patients with DFN.",

            "text": "Distal femur nonunions (DFN) are a complex problem to the treating surgeon as they are inherently difficult to manage and also associated with significant patient disability [1] [2] [3] . This problem is compounded if it occurs in elderly patients as they are associated with a nonunion rate of 24% [4] due to factors like poor bone stock, low activity levels and medical comorbidities which lead to poorer outcomes [5, 6] . Attempting re-fixation in these patients is associated with high chances of failure of fixation due to osteoporotic bone and metaphyseal bone loss [7, 8] . Moreover, adhering to protected weight-bearing following internal fixation is challenging to geriatric patients due to decreased cognitive status and muscle weakness which in turn may precipitate another failure of fixation [8] . Total joint replacement is a recognised management option in DFN as it avoids problems related to union and also avoids delayed weight-bearing. Cemented modular endoprosthetic replacement in managing DFN is a welldescribed option which enables immediate weight-bearing following surgery leading to faster recovery of geriatric patients [9] [10] [11] . Currently, the literature surrounding the use of endoprosthesis in DFN is limited to a handful of small case series with limited numbers of patients [6, [10] [11] [12] . This study was performed to evaluate the outcomes and complications following cemented modular distal femoral endoprosthesis used in managing DFN in elderly patients.",

All patients were evaluated with blood investigations, namely complete blood count, ESR and CRP, to rule out infection. Knee aspiration was done in all cases prior to surgery to rule out infection. All surgeries were performed by two experienced surgeons. The implants used in these cases were as follows: LPS -Limb Preservation System (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, IN) was used in 18 patients ( Fig. 1) , Link Megasystem-C (Waldemar Link GmbH & Co., Hamburg, Germany) in 3 patients (Fig. 2) and ResTOR Prosthesis (Sushrut-Adler Mediequip Pvt.

The implants and the bone fragments of the nonunion were visualised. The distal femoral fracture fragments were resected and retained to allow for sizing of the components to aid in restoration of joint line. After taking an 8-mm proximal tibia cut, the tibial canal was reamed sequentially followed by assembling of final components. The tibial components were implanted with minimal cement beneath the tray. Following this, the femoral preparation was done. Using the removed femoral pieces of femoral bone, the measurement for the size of the components was planned. A trial placement of components was done to assess limb rotation and patellar tracking. The femoral canal was reamed and trial components were assembled. After placing a canal plug, the femoral canal was washed thoroughly with a pulse lavage and dried. Third-generation cementing technique using antibiotic-loaded cement was used in all cases. Wound was closed in layers with a suction drain. All patients received 150 mg of oral Aspirin medication for 45 days as a routine for thromboprophylaxis following surgery.",

            "text": "Our study shows favourable results with megaprosthesis in managing DFN in elderly patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of endoprosthesis replacement for DFN in elderly patients. All our patients were allowed full weightbearing immediately post-surgery. Seventy-five percent of the patients were able to ambulate independently in the latest follow-up and all patients were extremely satisfied with their outcomes. We had a complication rate of 29.1% (7 patients) and had implant-related complication only in one patient (4.7%). At the time of this report, all surviving patients had well-functioning prosthesis. Four patients died at an average 21.3 months following surgery due to factors not related with the fracture or surgery. DFN which occur in elderly patients pose a challenge to the treating surgeon due to problems related to the fracture-like osteoporosis, metaphyseal bone loss and problems related to the patient like age, associated co-morbidities and decreased compliance [1-4, 13, 14] . With every nonunion in the distal femur, there is also associated implant toggling leading to inadequate bone stock making it difficult to achieve a good fixation during revision surgery. This problem is further compounded in elderly patients with osteoporosis [6, 7] . Moreover, attempting another fixation surgery would involve restricted weight-bearing for about three months which would be very difficult for elderly patients to comply. Restricted weight-bearing in elderly patients would precipitate other medical problems due to prolonged immobilisation [15, 16] . Hence, attempting another revision fixation would be associated with a higher chance of failure and higher incidence of complications. Use of a cemented megaprosthesis serves as an answer addressing all the above problems. Employing modular tumour prosthesis in distal femur fractures and nonunions have been described before. Bettin et al. [15] in their study of 18 acute distal femur fractures above 60 years managed with endoprosthesis reported good outcomes in all surviving patients. They suggested endoprosthesis replacements in acute distal femur fractures in elderly patients as a viable option as it provided immediate weight-bearing. Similar favourable results were seen in studies by Lundh et al. [17] in their study of 17 comminuted fractures around the knees in elderly. However, these studies involved acute distal femur fractures. Dealing with a nonunion of the distal femur is a completely different entity due to factors like fibrosis, knee stiffness and difficulty in exposure. These issues were echoed by Vaishya et al. [6] in their study of 10 cases of resistant DFN managed with megaprosthesis. While using megaprosthesis in DFN, two issues are of utmost importance in achieving a favourable outcome. Rotational alignment of the prosthesis is important to prevent gait abnormalities and restoration of the joint line is vital to prevent complications with regard to patellar maltracking and knee pain. Pre-operative planning with adequate radiographs and detailed examination is of utmost importance in these cases as most of the normal landmarks may be distorted due to the fracture and previous surgery.",

An average knee flexion of 69.5 (40-110) was seen and this was mainly attributable to the scarring and fibrosis of tissues due to previous surgery. Eighteen patients (75%) had more than one operation prior to the procedure, and during surgery, extensive soft tissue scarring and fibrosis was seen. Another reason would be that we used a medial parapatellar approach to perform this surgery in all our cases. Most of the cases had prior surgeries done through a lateral approach. Hence, the presence of two scars increased the scar tissue and thereby resulted in decreased range of motion. Hence, it would be necessary to counsel patients that complete range of motion prior to the initial injury would be difficult to achieve in these nonunions. However, all our patients were able to do all their daily activities without much assistance. It is also important to note that in elderly patients, physical demands are low and even a decreased degree of knee flexion would be acceptable.",

Similar complication rates were seen in similar studies involving distal femur endoprosthesis replacement. In our study, two cases (8.3%) developed bone cement implantation syndrome. This life-threatening complication is common in cemented arthroplasty in elderly patients. A study of 55 patients undergoing cemented hip arthroplasty showed cement-associated hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 70 mmHg, or reduction in MAP > 15 mmHg) in 38% of patients and oxygen desaturation in 25% of patients [18] . Data from three studies show the incidence of intraoperative mortality during cemented THR to be 0.11% (95% CI 0.07-0.15%) in elderly patients [19] [20] [21] . Careful monitoring by the anaesthetist is essential during cementing and during release of tourniquet [21, 22] . Both the cases in our series recovered with prompt identification of the problem, resuscitation and intensive care management. Deep infection requiring debridement was seen in one case (4.1%).
