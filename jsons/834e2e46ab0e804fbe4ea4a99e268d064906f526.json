We observed that antibodies targeting the N protein and the RBD were the earliest to be 56 detected (Fig. 1a) . Thirteen days post-symptom onset, 100% of patients had detectable antibodies to 57 both proteins. A similar profile was observed for anti-S2 antibodies but with a mean time lag of two 58 days. Antibodies to the S1 subunit were the last to be detected and remained undetectable for two 59 patients. High levels of anti-N and anti-RBD antibodies were detected in the large majority of samples 60 obtained fourteen days post-symptom onset whereas very heterogeneous levels of anti-S1 antibodies 61 were found in the same samples (Fig. 1b) . The positive correlations between each ELISA are shown 62 in Extended Data Fig. 1 . Significant differences were observed between intensive care versus non-63 intensive care patients for anti-S1, anti-S2 and anti-N antibody levels, from eight days post-symptom 64 onset (Extended Data Fig. 2a) . A slight difference was observed for anti-N antibody levels according to Furthermore, plasmas from twelve patients that had previously been infected with other coronaviruses 75 (OC43 (n=5), 229E (n=4), NL63 (n=2) or HKU1 (n=1)) did not have any effect on SARS-CoV-2 76 pseudotype infectivity (Extended Data Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 2 ). As expected, our results 77 demonstrate that the production of NAbs correlates with the production of antibodies targeting the S1, 78 S2 and RBD domains and we detected NAbs in all COVID-19 patients fifteen days post-symptom 79 onset (Fig. 1a) . The NAb titers increase from one week post-symptom onset and reaches a plateau 80 one week after (Fig. 2a, 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3) . However, the NAb titers reached were variable 81 between patients, 17% generated low levels of NAbs (40 \u2264 titers < 160), 73% intermediate levels (160 82 \u2264 titers < 1280) and 10% high levels (1280 \u2264 titers) (Fig. 2a) . Positive correlations between NAb titers 83 and anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-N or anti-RBD antibody levels, as well as white blood cells and lymphocytes 84 counts are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5 . Significantly higher NAb titers were observed in patients 85 with severe forms (p=0.04) and in women (p=0.03) from 14 days post-symptoms onset (Extended 86 Data Fig. 6 ). In contrast, no significant difference was observed according to the age. We also had the 87 opportunity to monitor the presence of NAbs in late samples of twelve patients (\u226540 days post-88 symptom onset) and we observed that the NAb titer dropped to low or undetectable level in most of 89 these samples ( Fig. 2b and Extended data Fig. 3 ).",
