            "text": "Indoor air pollution is a serious health problem as it causes about 4.5 million annual deaths globally resulting from pneumonia (12%), stroke (34%), ischemic heart diseases (IHD) (26%), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (22%), and lung cancer (LC) (6%) (Amoatey et al., 2017; Tageldin et al., 2012; Thurston et al., 2016; WHO, 2018). Indoor air pollution has been extensively studied in homes (Morawska et al., 2017; Rohra and Taneja, 2016), schools (Cai et al., 2015; Forns et al., 2017), hospitals (Cabo Verde et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015b), offices (Azuma et al., 2018; Song et al., 2015), restaurants (Dai et al., 2018; Fazlzadeh et al., 2015), and subway metros (Kim et al., 2015; Xu and Hao, 2017). However, indoor air pollution continues to be a global problem, especially in developing countries. Research studies have shown that about 90% of time is being spent in the aforementioned indoor environments (Andrade and Dominski, 2018). This is about 5 times higher than that of average time spent in outdoor environments, which indicates the enormity of human health risk posed by the indoor air pollutants (Andrade and Dominski, 2018; Boor et al., 2017; Cincinelli and Martellini, 2017; Du et al., 2018). These indoor air pollutants generally originate from the ambient environment. However, in cities with high ambient air pollutant levels, indoor air pollutants may be of greater concern (Morawska et al., 2017).",

Further, the GCC countries are categorized as developing countries and they are well-known as the hub for the majority of global oil reserves and crude oil production plants. Hence, with the recent increase in industrial activities, infrastructural developments, and population growth, which are coupled with unfavorable outdoor weather conditions, indoor air quality (IAQ) can be counted as a great concern for human health. This affirms that there can be a high risk of exposure to indoor air pollutants compared to the countries with favorable weather conditions, where people spend much of their time in outdoor environments.",

            "text": "Since external and internal air pollutant sources and activities may vary significantly among the GCC countries, the review provides an in-depth analysis of indoor air pollution, according to different geographic locations (Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates (UAE)). For all of these countries, most indoor air pollution studies have been focused on measuring the concentration levels and characterization of chemical species. Previous reviews have shown that particulate matters (PMs), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and heavy metals were the major indoor air pollutants in the GCC countries (Abdul-Wahab and Yaghi, 2004; Al-Rehaili, 1999; Al Mulla et al., 2015; Argyropoulos et al., 2016; Elkilani and Bouhamra, 2001; Elsayed et al., 2016; Farahat, 2016; Omidvarborna et al., 2018; Saraga et al., 2017). Recent studies in KSA have identified Radon (222Rn) gas as another indoor air pollutant (Abo-Elmagd et al., 2018; Alghamdi and Aleissa, 2014). Moreover, it has been reported that indoor air pollution in most cities in the GCC region is due to the infiltration of ambient air pollutants into residential buildings, poor ventilations, burning of biomasses (Arabian incense), and overcrowding (Argyropoulos et al., 2016; Fadeyi et al., 2014; Jomehzadeh et al., 2017; Weitzman et al., 2016; Yaghi and Abdul-Wahab, 2003). For example, incomplete burning of Arabian incense emits CO, PM10, PM2.5, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and black carbon (BC), which cause deleterious health effects for the exposed population (Du et al., 2018). To critically assess the current state of indoor air pollution in the GCC countries, this structured review was conducted to characterize emission of indoor air pollutants, identify the sources, discuss the possible mitigation strategies, identify knowledge gaps, and recommend future research works. For this purpose, >130 research articles were selected and reviewed.",

Further, infiltration of PMs from outdoor sources is the major contributor to indoor PM levels in UAE; because, SO2 can be converted to sulfate PMs as a result of high ambient temperature, which favors photochemical reactions (Hamdan et al., 2018).",

Elsayed et al. (2016) characterized a complete profiling of Bakhour (an Arabian incense), as a commonly burnt indoor household biomass used in UAE (commonly produced in Sharjah). It was found that Bakhour emitted trace metals such as Pb, Zn, Cd, Al, Fe, Co, and other known or suspected carcinogenic compounds of acetic acid phenylmethyl ester, benzoic acid hydrazide, ethylbenzene, 1,2-dimethoxy-4-(1-propenyl)-benzene, 9-dodecyl-tetradecahydro-anthracene, and \u03b1-methyl-benzenemethanol. About 859 chemical compounds (e.g., p-xylene, styrene, \u03b2-myrcene, acetic acid, furfural, 1,4-dibenzehaxanoic acid, azulene, diethyl phthalates) are known to be emitted from the smokes and fine ashes of Bakhour (Dalibalta et al., 2015). Hookah cigarette is another major source of indoor air pollution problem in UAE. Weitzman et al. (2016) measured that there is a wide variability of exposure levels between non-hookah PM2.5 concentration level (210.8 \u03bcg/m3 (95% CI: 78.4\u2013343.2)) and hookah smoking PM2.5 concentration level (428.6 \u03bcg/m3 (95% CI: 50.2\u2013806.9)) rooms. Additionally, large amounts of Zn, Cu, V, Ni, Pb, Mn and Cr elements were found to exist as ultrafine particles (PM0.1) and fine particles (PM2.5) in UAE indoors (Hamdan et al., 2018), where the majority of dwellers spend 85% of their times indoors, especially during summer seasons.",

The sources of the pollutants were attributed to smoking, air conditioners, and kitchen activities. A one year IAQ measurement campaign was conducted in 16 elementary schools within Dubai and Fujairah in UAE. Average indoor O3 concentration (106 \u03bcg/m3) in classrooms was found to be low compared to average CO (1.43 mg/m3) and CO2 (3110 mg/m3) levels. However, the large amount of average inhalable PM concentration levels (316 to 9828 \u03bcg/m3) were found to be a major concern, especially to children in the classrooms (Fadeyi et al., 2014). This is due to greater susceptibility to indoor air pollution by children as they could breathe larger volume of air contained respirable pollutants compared to adults (Cai et al., 2015).",

According to Ali et al. (2016a), average exposure levels to organophosphate FRs in indoor cars, air conditioning filters, and household floors in Jeddah were recorded to be 10,500, 15,400, and 3750 ppb, respectively. From the study, penta-PBDEs, decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), and chlorinated alkyl phosphate were identified as the most common indoor chemicals within the three indoor microenvironments. In another study, indoor HCHO in a medical science laboratory room was investigated in King Saud University. The sources of HCHO exposure levels (~0.93\u20131.2 mg/m3) were attributed to poor ventilations. However, HCHO concentrations were higher at the center of the dissecting rooms compared to the corners, where instructors and students might experience higher exposure levels (Vohra, 2011). In addition, several studies have identified the presence of other non-conventional organic pollutants (including siloxanes, phenolic antioxidants, and tetrabromobisphenol A) in indoor dust in KSA, which were emitted from household products (Tran et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2016).",

Radon is known to be colorless and odorless gas. Due to its carcinogenic health effects, Radon has been widely monitored in many developed countries (Al-Jarallah and Fazal Ur, 2005). A measuring campaign of indoor Radon gas in 786 dwellings in Riyadh showed an average emission of 24.6 Bq/m3, which was below the WHO standard limit (100 Bq/m3). Radon levels were high (1\u2013195 Bq/m3) in rooms with low ventilation rates compared to central air conditioning rooms (Alghamdi and Aleissa, 2014). Similarly, about 651 dosimeters were deployed to measure indoor Radon levels in 60 rooms, including kitchen, bed rooms, and living rooms over a continuous period of 8 months in Riyadh. The overall average (18.4 Bq/m3), minimum (2.0 Bq/m3), and maximum (69 Bq/m3) concentration levels were below WHO standard limit (Al-Saleh, 2007). In King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Radon concentrations in buildings with basement during winter and summer seasons were 44.3 and 26.1 Bq/m3, and buildings without basement were 16.1 and 16.7 Bq/m3, respectively. Thus, seasonal variations were critical factors affecting Radon concentration levels in KSA. Exposures to Radon gas in residential buildings were carried out in different parts of Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah in the Western province of KSA over a 6 months period. The concentration levels of Radon (Bq/m3), which could be exposed to the residents of the Northern, Eastern, Western and Southern parts of the city were 42 \u00b1 1.6, 21 \u00b1 2.5, 27 \u00b1 3.2, and 37 \u00b1 2.6, respectively (Mohamed et al., 2014).",

Large overcrowding at worshiping places (Mosques), pilgrimage centers, and airports are the important causes of airborne bioaerosols. Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah is a province in KSA, where there could be high concentration levels of indoor bioaerosols might happen due to overcrowding of pilgrims. A survey study measured pilgrim's exposure to bacterial and fungi aerosols over four consecutive weeks using sedimentation procedures in Al-Haram and Al-Nabawi cities. The most common identified bacterial aerosols were Staphylococcus sp. (32.47%), Mircrococus sp. (18.8%), Baccilus sp. (12.85%), and Dermacoccus (11.23%); while, Aspergigillus sp. (78%) was the highest among identified fungi species. The main causes were poor ventilation and overcrowding. However, the degree of infection depends on the immunity of the exposed population (Alananbeh et al., 2017). Human adenovirus (42.8%), human coronavirus (42.8%), Haemophilus influenza (14.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (14.2%) were the dominant respiratory pathogens that identified in King Abdul Aziz International Airport during Hajj season (Memish et al., 2014). Another study on concentration and characterization of bioaerosols using Air-port MD gelatin filter sampler was conducted in mosque buildings in Makkah, KSA. Bacterial and fungal concentrations were found to be 10\u201350 CFU/m3 and 10 CFU/m3, respectively. Bacillus sp., Microccoccus sp., and Aspergillus niger were the most abundant species of airborne microbes found within the mosques (Mashat, 2015). Later, a study focused on bioaerosols among the schools in KSA. Bacteria aerosols of 252 samples in 25 middle schools in Riyadh were isolated over one month period. It was found that the highest airborne bacteria were Pseudomona stutzeri, Francisella tularensis, Ralstonia mannitolillytica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Kocuria kristinae. The highest bioaerosol concentrations were occurred during class hours (overcrowding); therefore, immediate mitigation action was required (Al Mijalli, 2017).",

A study in 40 water pipe caf\u00e9 and 16 smoke-free buildings showed that PM2.5 exposure level was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in caf\u00e9 buildings (476 \u03bcg/m3) than that of the smoke-free buildings (17 \u03bcg/m3). The emissions in the caf\u00e9 building far exceeded the 24-h average (25 \u03bcg/m3) WHO standard by about 19 times (Abdul-Wahab et al., 2015b). Hence, indoor air pollution poses a health threat to Qatari residents even in a building, where no major activities occur (e.g., smoke-free) (Al Mulla et al., 2015). This implies that infiltration from outdoor sources, mostly from dust storms, heavy traffic emissions, and industrial activities are the principal sources of indoor air pollution in Qatar (Abdel-Salam, 2017; Alfoldy, 2018).",

Also, the average respirable heavy metal PMs (Pb, Cu, Ni, and Cr) was measured to be 1293, 131, 17 ng/m3, respectively (Yaghi and Abdul-Wahab, 2003). In 2003, assessment of indoor dust aerosols in residential houses located in close proximity to industries revealed high amounts (ppm) of Pb (108 \u00b1 65), Cr (34 \u00b1 14), Cu (108 \u00b1 91), and Ni (130 \u00b1 125). Correlation analysis showed that indoor Cu and Pb were generated internally, while Ni and Cr were entered from the ambient environment (Yaghi and Abdul-Wahab, 2004). High amounts of TSP (171.5 \u03bcg/m3) and heavy metals (ng/m3), including Cr (3), Zn (748), Ni (4.9), and Pb (3.2) were detected in 12 houses in Sohar industrial estate (Abdul-Wahab and Yaghi, 2004).",

The pollutants were emitted from the artifact collections and decorations (Abdul-Wahab et al., 2013). Comparative assessment of IAQ in two residential apartments in Muscat (built in 1986 and 1991) showed that indoor TVOC concentrations were 330 and 1250 \u03bcg/m3, respectively. Thus, the exposure levels to TVOC in the relatively new building far exceeded the acceptable standards compared to the old building (Abdul-Wahab, 2017). An ultra-modern library complex in Muscat with >1000 seater-capacity was examined for sick building syndrome. The short-term (15 min sampling) study results disclosed that the library occupants were exposed to high levels of CO2 (2073 mg/m3), TVOC (510 \u03bcg/m3), and PM10 (71 \u03bcg/m3) (Abdul-Wahab et al., 2015a).",

Pb coated paints had been commonly used in indoor households in Bahrain since 1930s. In 1986, atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) analysis of fine paint PMs sampled from household buildings showed that Pb concentrations were deemed within the US limits (200\u20135700 ppm). However, they were considered hazardous to human health, especially the vulnerable populations such as children and the aged population (Madany et al., 1987). Indoor dusts, the main source of inhalable fine PMs, were collected from households and hospitals and analyzed to determine their chemical constituents. The results showed that the average indoor Pb, Cd, and Cr were 360, 29.2, and 154.5 ppm in homes and 697, 72, and 144.4 ppm in hospitals, respectively. The study attributed the high concentration of heavy metals to outdoor traffic emissions (Akhter, 1993). Similarly, in-home assessment of indoor heavy metals from traffic related emissions was investigated. The probable concentrations of human exposure for Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, and Ni were reported to be 517, 202, 1.9, 11, and 10 ppm, respectively (Madany, 1994). All the conducted studies in Bahrain supported the presence of Pb in indoor environments.",

In addition, the unfavorable climatic conditions, such as high temperature and humidity, and low precipitation have increased the ambient concentration levels of these recalcitrant pollutants (Table 5\n) (Farahat, 2016; Omidvarborna et al., 2018). This situation is different in UAE, where ambient air pollutant levels, especially PMs from dust storms and trace gases from petroleum industries, are very high. Such conditions have led to high usage of air conditioners in UAE (Azar and Al Ansari, 2017; Bekhet et al., 2017; Giusti and Almoosawi, 2017; Krarti and Dubey, 2018). According to Azuma et al.

Fadeyi et al. (2014) reported a strong correlation (r = 0.88) of CO2 concentration levels and ventilation systems in school buildings in Dubai. They concluded that the levels of indoor air pollutants were greatly reduced by proper ventilation systems, but at the same time, it could increase pollutant concentrations by taking infiltrated air from the outdoor environment. Although many environmentally sustainable building designs have been introduced in UAE, they have focused only on CO2 reductions from indoor pollution other than improving ventilation systems. Therefore, since adequate ventilation mechanisms to prevent entry of outdoor pollutants have not been incorporated in the current buildings in UAE, infiltration of ambient air pollutants is now a big challenge that should be addressed (Table 6\n).",

For example, in one case, IAQ modeling approach called TAS was employed to simulate environmentally sustainable school building design capable of adapting the unfavorable microclimate conditions in Makkah and Abha cities. The results showed that for a better environmental performance, including IAQ, the modeled buildings in the hot climate of Makkah natural ventilations were required, while in Abha city with moderate climate cross natural ventilations were required (Alwetaishi and Balabel, 2017). However, El-Sharkawy and Javed (2018) argued that the major source of indoor pollution was infiltration of outdoor sources, which might be as a result of natural ventilations. In another study, CFD simulation system was employed to assess the optimum reduction of IAQ of Al-Haram mosque in Makkah. The model output revealed that indoor CO2 levels were reduced by increasing the ventilation rate (Jaafar et al., 2017). Hence, a study concluded that the residents of KSA would prefer of purchasing houses with improved ventilation systems to reduce indoor air pollution (Opoku and Abdul-Muhmin, 2010). This implies environmentally sustainable building design that prevents penetration of ambient air into buildings that should be implemented in KSA (El-Sharkawy, 2014).",

The same as other GCC countries, there are no building designs in Qatar that incorporate advanced ventilation efficiency to improve IAQ. Green building rating study based on Global sustainability assessment system (GSAS) procedure was conducted in some selected buildings in Qatar. According to the results, 50% of the occupants felt that controlling indoor trace gases (use of low emitting VOCs building materials and improvement of natural and mechanical ventilations in building designs) would ensure occupants productivity and health (Al Horr et al., 2017). Additionally, analysis of indoor air velocity in office buildings in Qatar, which is a critical factor in reducing build-up indoor air pollutants, showed that the indoor air velocity (0.0\u20130.05 m/s) in the current buildings did not meet the limits set by ASHRAE (0.18\u20130.25 m/s) (Indraganti and Boussaa, 2017). Further, the degree of indoor air pollution also could be affected by building envelopes, air tightness, and ventilation systems as mentioned by Alfoldy (2018).",

Kuwait ambient temperature in summer season could reach about 45 \u00b0C and the lowest temperature during the winter season (November to January) could reach \u22122 \u00b0C with average annual precipitation below 127 mm (Yassin and Almouqatea, 2010). Thus, this climatic system may affect the ambient air pollution levels and subsequently IAQ, which depend primarily on the meteorological factors (Alenezi and Aldaihan, 2018). Hence, to improve IAQ, various new green building design projects have been examined (Table 6). Some studies improved ventilation systems of the existing local buildings. A compartment building modeling system was applied to a typical Kuwaiti building to determine the indoor VOC levels. The results showed that an efficient indoor VOC reduction could be achieved if the ratio of makeup air to the recirculation air could fall within the range of 0.7\u22121.3 (Elkilani and Bouhamra, 2001). According to Al-Hemoud et al. (2018), application of conventional ventilation systems such as opening of doors compared to door closures in an office building did not result in a significant reduction in indoor VOC concentrations. In their study, both door opening and closure maintained VOC concentration levels of 10 ppb. Hence, new technologies should be implemented to further improve the IAQ.",

Replacing charcoal burning stoves with electronic heating plates had a greater potential of reducing concentration levels of CO emitted from hookah smoking locations (Weitzman et al., 2016). Since indoor air pollution is one of the public health issues in UAE schools, UAE government has instituted Emirates coalition for green schools. The main objective was optimizing environmental performance of various schools starting from K-12 to the university level. This policy requires buildings that would significantly reduce indoor VOC emissions to acceptable limits by controlling/reducing the consumption of sealants, adhesives, and paints (Jason and Sheena, 2018).",

Although this policy intends to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission from buildings, it will also reduce indoor air pollution. Moreover, the policy accounts for efficient ventilation systems, which is an important factor of energy reduction plans (Al-Tamimi, 2017).",

Wearing recommended respirators with improvement in sanitation practices, such as disinfections, is a potential remedy of reducing contaminations from airborne harmful microbes during Hajj (Memish et al., 2014). Further, in order to reduce human exposure levels to bioaerosols, frequent cleaning of air conditioning filters and efficient ventilations were recommended in school buildings (Al Mijalli, 2017).",

The situation in Qatar involves very few indoor air pollution control recommendations based on specific IAQ characterization studies (Table 7). For example, a study recommended thorough cleaning of playgrounds in all schools to avoid transportation of outdoor pollutants (PMs) to school buildings. Likewise, installation of air cleaners and frequent renovation of buildings could improve the IAQ (Abdel-Salam, 2017). Currently, there is a ban on public smoking in Qatar but the legislation exempts indoor water pipes. Al Mulla et al. (2015) suggested a ban on indoor tobacco smoking, which is one of the main causes of indoor air pollution. Finally, advanced ventilation systems could be incorporated by the current and future green buildings to reduce indoor pollutants in Qatar (Sergio et al., 2017).",

The review of previous studies showed minor differences of indoor air pollutants in each GCC country.

The main sources of these pollutants were infiltration of ambient air, burning of Arabian incense, and smoking. Other pollutants such as PAHs, Radon, bacteria, and fungi bioaerosols were well investigated in very few GCC countries, which were originated primary from overcrowding and poor ventilation systems. There was a lack of science based mitigation studies that could reduce the emission and the exposure of these pollutants in the GCC countries. However, several recommendations and precautionary measures were provided to minimize the levels of exposure.
