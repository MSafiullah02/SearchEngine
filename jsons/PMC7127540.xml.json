            "text": "Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to position 4 of phosphatidylinositol, resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). This important phosphoinositide is involved in numerous cellular processes such as vesicular budding and membrane dynamics. Apart from these signaling roles, PI4P also serves as a crucial intermediate in the synthesis of other phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). Mammalian cells contain four different PI4K isoforms catalogued into class II (PI4K II\u03b1 and PI4K II\u03b2) and class III (PI4K III\u03b1 and PI4K III\u03b2).1, 2, 3 Both members of class III have been proven to be implicated in the replication of various ss(+)RNA viruses. Specific virus-encoded proteins are able to recruit these PI4Ks and misuse them to produce highly phosphorylated membrane compartments, which serve as a base for the replication complex. In particular, PI4K III\u03b2 is known to be indispensable in the replication of a number of viruses from the Picornaviridae family, including the most common human viral pathogens, Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses.4, 5, 6, 7 Furthermore, this enzyme is implicated in the replication of Coronaviruses, represented by SARS-CoV.8 In addition, both isoforms from class III PI4K family, PI4K III\u03b2 and PI4K III\u03b1, have been shown to be necessary host factors involved in the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus.9, 10, 11 Recently, several groups have identified new inhibitors of class II PI4Ks12, 13, 14, 15 and selective inhibitors of PI4K III\u03b116, 17, 18 and PI4K III\u03b2.11, 18, 19, 20, 21 Furthermore, the crystal structures of PI4K II\u03b1,22 PI4K II\u03b223 and PI4K III\u03b2,24, 25 were solved during the last year, thus allowing further optimization of inhibitor efficiency and selectivity.26\n",

Firstly, some compounds can be regarded as derivatives of PIK93 possessing a five-membered central core connected to an aromatic side chain. In contrast, the second type of PI4K III\u03b2 inhibitors with the archetypal example being T-00127-HEV1 is characterized by a bicyclic central core and a similar aromatic sidechain.3 Within this study, we have used purine derivatives and several other structurally related bicycles as potential analogs of the latter group. Our major goals were to complete the structure\u2013activity relationship study and to understand the role of methyl substituents on the central purine core. Although our initial results indicated that the purine analog is approximately six times less active than the parent compound T-00127-HEV1,6 we decided to use this structural pattern to explore mainly the potential substitution at positions 8 and 2 because of easy access to a vast variety of these derivatives.",

The removal of the nitrogen atom at position 7 is accompanied by significant drop of activity (compound 6), which can be easily explained by missing hydrogen bond between the core of the inhibitor and amide moiety of Val613 and steric hindrance of additional hydrogen atom, which causes additional distortion of the amino sidechain and loss of another hydrogen contact with carbonyl moiety of Val613 (Supporting Fig. 1B). The docking results nicely explain also the observed lack of activity of 8-substituted derivatives caused by a limited space of the binding cavity, which is appropriate for the accommodation of a methyl group (Supporting Figs. 1 and 2). The partial loss of activity of compounds 14 and 15 with the additional nitrogen at position 8 could be explained by repulsion of electron pair of this nitrogen atom, which occupy this small cavity, and carbonyl group of Glu611(Supporting Fig. 1C and D).",
