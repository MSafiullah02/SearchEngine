Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.",

There may be up to 90 or even 100 million tweets per day (Calvo et al., 2017) , so most of research is conducted on random samples (Ritter et al., 2011; Mohammad et al., 2017; Pandey et al., 2017) . We are interested in a million-level of tweets and also in a larger time span. Another challenge is that many existing research only focused on English tweets (Farruque et al., 2019; Dini and Bittar, 2016) . The We Feel platform by Larsen et al. (2015) deals with real-time tweets in a large-scale but only can process English ones. To understand the global influence of corona virus, and estimate the emotion variation across culture and region, we want to utilize texts in multiple languages. The third challenge is the lack of labeled dataset for COVID-19. Though there exist labeled Twitter dataset for sentiment and emotions (Go et al., ; Mohammad et al., 2017; Hasan et al., 2014) , due to the domain discrepancy, we still wish to have a manually-labeled dataset for training to have a better performed model.",

Due to the high capacity, we look at the tweets from March 24 to 26, 2020 to get language and geolocation statistics. Among these tweets, 8,148,202 tweets have the language information (lang field of the Tweet Object in Tweet API), and 76,460 tweets have the geographic information (country code value from the place field if not none). We show the distributions in Figure 1 and 2. To train the models for classification, we built EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset. We randomly annotated 1,000 English tweets selected from our crawled data. Following the work of EmoLex (Mohammad and Turney, 2013; Hasan et al., 2014) , we classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. Each tweet is labeled as one, two or three emotion labels. For each emotion, we made sure that the primary label appeared in 125 tweets, and there is no number control in the secondary and tertiary label. We then split into 100/25 for each emotion as the training/testing set. We release two versions of the dataset: single-labeled version where only the primary label is kept for each example, and multi-labeled version where all the labels are kept. In this way, both single-label classification and multi-label classification can be conducted. We release the EmoCt dataset to the public 4 , where only Tweet IDs and labels can be found by eliminating the actual texts due to corresponding restrictions.",

To understand why the public may feel fear and sadness, we then attempt to analyze words and phrases that have a high correlation with both emotions. We apply our BERT(ft) model from the single-label classification task to predict the emotion label on randomly-picked 1 million tweets data on April 7, 2020. Then we compare two methods to do further analysis. Note that we keep only the tweets labeled as fear and sadness. Attention Weight When predicting the emotion label for each tweet, we take the last attention layer of the model and collect the top 3 tokens which have the maximum attention weights. Finally we rank the tokens by frequency and plot the wordcloud 6 of the top 500 tokens after filtering some stopwords in Figure 3 . A drawback of this method is that the tokens are split, so we can see some keywords that may not be meaningful without contexts, for example: like, know and 2020. However, we can get some reasonable keywords: fever, corona, spread, virus and so on. Such words appear with a high frequency in the tweets labeled as fear and sadness, which may explain what and why people are feeling fear or sad. Note that this method can handle multiple language input as the pre-trained BERT model supports 104 different languages, though training was conducted on an English corpus.",

We apply the Stanza Python library to do POS tagging (Qi et al., 2020) and we include supporting to six languages including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, German and Chinese. Similarly, we plot the top 500 keywords and phrases based on frequency in Figure 4 . There are some informative keywords Figure 5 : Comparison of emotion distribution. and phrases captured: pandemic, China, economy, \u958b\u59cb (means starting in English), President Trump, White House and so on.

We still choose the single-label classification BERT(ft) model to do prediction. We provide a case study on two words: mask and lockdown. We first pick 1 million tweets randomly from the data of the date March 29th, 2020. By filtering on the keywords, we found 8,071 tweets that contain the word mask, and 31,146 tweets that contain the word lockdown. Figure 5 shows the comparison of emotion distribution among 1 million samples (1M), tweets with mask, and tweets with lockdown. In the 1 million data, most tweets are classified into negative classes like fear, anger and sadness. But when people are talking about masks, more tweets are classified into anticipation and trust, which is sometimes more neutral and positive. For the tweets talking about lockdown, there is no significant difference with that of 1M. To further analyze the trends, we select the data of two weeks (March 25, 2020 -April 7, 2020 , and apply the same model to predict the emotion labels on all the tweets we crawled (around 3 million each day) that contains the two mentioned keywords respectively. There is no significant change for the emotion distribution in all the data. However, we found the dominating emotions and variations of the change are closely related to the topic. In Figure 6 and 7, we illustrate the emotion trend for each single day of the selected keywords. The high variation (plot in solid lines in the figures) showed up in sadness, anger and anticipation for the tweets that contain the word mask in Figure 6 , and disgust, sadness for the tweets that contain the word lockdown in Figure 7 . Especially, for the lockdown tweets, the percentage of disgust emotion had a significant increase on March 27 and dropped on the next two days, as marked with the black asterisks. To further investigate, we looked at the news in March 27, which included U.S. as the first country to report 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, and 9 in 10 Americans were staying home; India and South Africa joined the countries to impose lockdowns. Given that the United States, India and Brazil have large group of twitter users, we assume that this dramatic change may be triggered by those news.",
