Thus, the identification of pCCoV relies on the detection of CCoV-IIa in extraintestinal tissues. To date, pCCoV infection has been reported mainly in dogs (Chen et al., 2019; Decaro et al., 2012 Decaro et al., , 2013 Ntafis et al., 2012; Pinto et al., 2014; Zicola et al., 2012) , although a hypervirulent CCoV-IIa strain was also reported in a wolf (Alfano et al., 2019) .

Of these 35 dogs, 6 lived in Italy and 29 had been imported from other countries (25 from Hungary and 4 illegally imported from an unknown country). The proportion of pCCoV-infected dogs varies markedly between regions: we found 6 pCCoV-infected dogs from Italy (6/292, 2%), 25 infected animals from Hungary (25/56, 45%) and 4 animals of unknown origin (4/4, 100%).
