There is also increasing recognition of human coronavirus and human bocavirus in these populations.

Recent prospective surveillance of 98 lung transplant recipients in Spain found an overall rate of respiratory viruses, asymptomatic and symptomatic, of 0.76 per patient-year and a significantly higher rate of 2.1 RVIs per patient-year in symptomatic patients.3 Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from asymptomatic patients were positive 11.5% of the time compared with 55.4% positive in symptomatic patients. The most frequently detected RVIs in symptomatic patients were picornaviruses, such as rhinovirus and enterovirus, at 43%, followed by coronavirus (16.7%) and influenza (16.7%). Symptomatic RVI detection progressed to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in 40% of patients.3 A prospective Swiss study reported similar results with an RVI incidence of 0.83 per patient-year, detection of respiratory viruses in 14% of those screened and 34% of symptomatic patients, and rhinovirus/enterovirus as the most common RVI.4 Human bocavirus, identified in 2005, has been reported to cause upper respiratory infection (URI), fevers, wheezing, LRTI, and diarrhea in normal hosts, and plays an unclear role in SOT recipients.5 Parainfluenza, RSV, hMPV, and influenza were the most frequently found viruses in LRTI and were associated with higher rates of hospitalization. Analyses of RVI in lung transplant recipients have reported a rate of infection from 1.4% to 60%, with detection 5 times more frequent if symptoms were present (Table 1\n).6, 7 Reported risks for RVI in lung transplant patients include increased calcineurin inhibitor levels, age less than 15 years, and underlying cause for transplant other than cystic fibrosis.4, 8\n",

In the study from Spain mentioned earlier, LRTI was associated with significant change in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) at 1 and 3 months following infection and nested case-control analysis reported a significant association between RVI within 3 months and acute rejection (hazard ratio [HR], 6.54; confidence interval [CI], 1.47\u201329.08; P = .01).3 Alternatively, the Swiss study with similar incidence rates found no such association.4 CLAD compromises long-term survival following lung transplant and although an association with previous viral infection has been explored in published literature, a definitive link remains unclear. Pooled incidence rates for CLAD in the meta-analysis mentioned earlier for virus-positive cases were 18% (9 out of 50 cases) compared with 11.6% (37 out of 319) in virus-negative cases, but because of limited number of overall events a link could not be confirmed.6 However, there are published epidemiologic links between RVI and CLAD as well as data on biologically plausible mechanisms underlying a causal relationship.5, 15, 16, 17 In addition, a recent large retrospective cohort (n = 250) of lung transplant recipients found an independent association between RVI and development of CLAD within 3 the next months (HR, 4.8; CI, 1.9\u201311.6; P<.01).18\n",

As noted earlier, asymptomatic viral shedding is seen frequently, including reports of asymptomatic RSV shedding in HSCT recipients for 35 to 80 days and persistent rhinovirus detection for 8 to 15 months in lung transplant recipients.3, 18, 24, 25 The ability of current molecular testing methods to detect virus in samples with few viral copies combined with prolonged viral shedding in SOT and HSCT recipients can create a challenge for clinicians trying to determine whether a positive molecular test indicates a true pathogen.26 The source or sampling method used is an important consideration. Respiratory samples are routinely obtained from aspirates/washes or swabs from the nasopharynx (NP) or oropharynx (OP) as well as more invasive collection methods such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). However, the choice of upper respiratory sample collection methodology for optimal viral recovery is uncertain. In children hospitalized because of respiratory infections, sensitivity of RVI detection with NP aspirates of 86% to 100% have been reported versus nasal swab sensitivity of 67% to 95%.27 A similar comparison of NP swabs with or without OP swabs in immunocompetent children found a higher sensitivity of NP swabs for RVI of 91% to 100%, which was greater than or equal to OP swabs (83%\u201398%), with combined testing increasing detection by 2% to 9%, depending on the virus.28 Investigation in adults reported higher sensitivity with NP washes (85%) than NP swabs (73%) or OP swabs (54%), and noted that maximal sensitivity was achieved through a combination of all 3 methods.29\n",

            "text": "In addition to the general preventive measures reviewed earlier, the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved agent for the prevention of severe RSV infection is palivizumab. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the F glycoprotein of RSV, and is approved for prevention of RSV in high-risk patients less than 2 years of age. Recommendations were published in 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics for palivizumab prophylaxis for infants and children less than 24 months of age with specific predisposing conditions.48 With respect to immunocompromised children, no specific recommendations were made, aside from considering prophylaxis in profoundly immunocompromised patients younger than 24 months of age. A more recent multidisciplinary consensus conference in Italy, referencing the lack of adequate clinical trials and statistical power, recommended against palivizumab for children with primary or acquired immunodeficiencies.49 In practice, the use of palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients varies widely. Approximately 50% of surveyed pediatric SOT centers used palivizumab for prophylaxis, in both candidates and recipients, with 93% of those targeting infants 0 to 12 months old and 79% extending use to 0 to 24 months.50 Only 10% provided palivizumab for patients 2 to 4 years old and 7% gave palivizumab for patients more than 4 years of age. This variability in practice is likely caused by the limited data on the efficacy of palivizumab prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients. In a retrospective pediatric HSCT cohort from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n = 275), nearly half of the high-risk patients received intravenous (IV) palivizumab. In the palivizumab treatment group, 30% developed RSV compared with only 4% of those who did not receive prophylaxis.51 Similarly, an approach limiting palivizumab only to those HSCT pediatric patients younger than 12 months with either a chronic oxygen requirement or severe combined immunodeficiency, pretransplant to 100 days posttransplant, found no increase in the incidence of RSV or patient outcomes compared with historical controls with wider use of palivizumab.52\n",

Reports of improved outcomes in the treatment of RSV in HSCT patients can be found for inhaled, oral, or IV ribavirin,46, 67, 68 as well as combinations of ribavirin with IVIG, palivizumab, and/or RSV-specific IVIG56; most support treatment at the URTI stage, before progression to LRTI. A systematic review of the available retrospective studies in 2011 reported that any form of ribavirin, alone or in combination with an immunomodulatory agent, was effective in preventing progression of URTI to LRTI, with a trend toward better outcomes with inhaled ribavirin plus an immunomodulator.56 Although negative studies are potentially less likely to achieve publication, there are data available suggesting that adjunctive corticosteroid use and palivizumab alone do not improve outcomes.69, 70\n",

Zanamivir is an inhaled NAI approved for treatment of influenza A and B in adults and children 7 years of age and older. Zanamivir is used less frequently than oral oseltamivir, likely because of the delivery route and rare reports of inhaled zanamivir failure.108\n",

Adenovirus infection in immunocompromised patients can range from asymptomatic viremia to significant localized or disseminated disease. In contrast with many of the other community-acquired respiratory viruses, adenoviral infection can occur from primary acquisition or through reactivation of virus. In 1 study, viral reactivation was linked to the timing of immune reconstitution and CD4+ T-cell counts.120 Depending on patient factors, clinical disease in immunocompromised patients can include pneumonia, hepatitis, colitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and encephalitis.5 In a 1993 to 2006 retrospective cohort of RVIs in pediatric SOT, HSCT, and oncology patients, adenoviral infection was associated with the greatest length of stay, and was the only specific virus that increased the risk of morbidity and mortality related to RVI (odds ratio, 3.7; CI, 1.1\u201312.6; P = .03).1\n",

Reports of recovery with reduced immune suppression alone make the need for therapy and optimal timing for intervention uncertain.124 As for most viral infections in SOT and HSCT patients, immunosuppression reduction is recommended if possible. Cidofovir, approved for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has been the most common antiviral used for treatment. Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral DNA polymerase with broad antiviral activity against DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses and adenovirus. Although cidofovir has in vitro activity against adenovirus and is generally accepted as the standard of care, cidofovir treatment efficacy is controversial.135, 137, 138 Dosing of cidofovir is generally 5 mg/kg IV once every 7 days, or 1 mg/kg IV 3 times per week, often in conjunction with probenecid and hydration.129 Cidofovir nephrotoxicity, which is not dose dependent, is the most common reason for discontinuation of therapy.137 Alternative therapies, including ribavirin and combination cidofovir plus IVIG, have been reported with limited data, and these are not routinely recommended for use.119, 122, 139\n",

Adoptive T-cell immunity uses donor virus-specific T-cells to treat infection, and has been reported to be safe and effective when performed early in the course of the infection.134, 142 Adoptive T-cell transfer has generally been limited to a few centers and predominantly in HSCT recipients, because of both the time and the expertise needed for cell preparation, but more recent methods may allow shorter generation time and more access to this therapy.143, 144\n",

The diagnosis of proven CMV pneumonitis is based on compatible clinical signs and/or symptoms and documented CMV in lung tissue. Traditionally, tissue-invasive CMV is based on histopathologic or immunohistochemical (IHC) findings consistent with tissue invasion on biopsy.178, 179 CMV cultures or quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing of tissue samples are difficult to interpret because a positive finding could indicate tissue-invasive disease, shedding in the setting of active viremia, or both.178 Recent updates to the definition of CMV pneumonia now include proven, probable, and possible CMV pneumonia. Proven disease still relies on identification of viral antigens or inclusion bodies via immunohistochemistry in biopsy material, but probable CMV pneumonia is defined as compatible symptoms plus CMV detection via viral isolation, culture, or quantitation of CMV DNA in BAL fluid.180 There is no definitive cutoff for CMV DNA load in the setting of CMV pneumonia; however, some reports suggest greater than 500 to 5500 IU/mL as a possible cutoff.180, 181 Possible CMV pneumonia has been suggested based on positive quantitative PCR performed on biopsy tissue.",

Risk stratification in organ transplant recipients relies heavily on donor and recipient CMV serologic results before transplant. Donors who are CMV immunoglobulin (Ig) G positive (D+) paired with recipients who are IgG negative (R\u2212) are considered the highest risk group. Recipients who are CMV D\u2212/R\u2212 are generally considered low risk, although community-acquired infection can occur posttransplant, and R+ patients are variably classified as intermediate-risk or high-risk, often center dependent. Recommended duration of prophylaxis varies based on organ system and risk stratification. For D+/R\u2212 heart transplant recipients, the recommended minimum duration of CMV prophylaxis is between 3 and 6 months. For D+/R\u2212 lung transplant recipients the minimum recommended duration is between 6 and 12 months, with some advocates for longer, even indefinite, prophylaxis. Centers using indefinite prophylaxis for lung transplant recipients report low incidence of CMV infection, which must be balanced against reports of association between GCV-resistant CMV and prolonged CMV prophylaxis, with an incidence of 10% to 50% GCV-resistant infection in some cases.177, 189, 190 For R+ recipients the minimum duration in lung is 6 months, and 3 months in heart recipients. In D\u2212/R\u2212 populations the routine use of CMV prophylaxis is not generally recommended.178 There are several published reports of potential benefit to the addition or sole use of CMVIg for prophylaxis, but, because of the limited data to support routine use, the addition of CMVIg is not routinely recommended.178, 191 The most recent consensus guidelines note that some experts add CMVIg for intermediate and higher-risk recipients, but there are no randomized studies indicating that CMVIg is any better than GCV or valganciclovir alone.",

Lower incidences of CMV infection are reported in patients treated with regimens including a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.194, 195, 196, 197 Although these results are not consistently reproducible, some experts recommend considering the use of mTOR inhibitors in the presence of clinically relevant, recurrent, or GCV-resistant CMV infection.198, 199, 200 Further, CMV vaccination is under evaluation with several candidate vaccines assessed in clinical trials, including live attenuated; recombinant glycoprotein B (gB); DNA plasmid; and virus-like particle systems.201 Investigations in immunocompromised patients have reported on the safety of a CMV DNA vaccine candidate (ASP0113) and a chimeric peptide vaccine (PF03512676) in HSCT, with some early evidence of potential clinical benefit as well.202, 203 Similarly, a phase 2 trial of an adjuvanted gB vaccine versus placebo in pretransplant liver and kidney patients showed reduced CMV viremia and days of GCV therapy following transplant, with the greatest effect seen in CMV seronegative patients.204 Therefore, although the current CMV vaccine candidates are not yet ready for clinical use, the available data plus the number of clinical trials either planned or ongoing in immunocompromised patients are very encouraging.",

HSV pneumonitis is uncommon in the era of antiviral prophylaxis, but thoracic transplant and HSCT recipients are reportedly at greatest risk.215, 216, 217 Similar to CMV pneumonitis, the recommended diagnostic test for HSV pneumonitis is tissue histopathology with IHC for HSV. Positive BAL PCR testing for HSV may represent contamination or oropharyngeal shedding.218 IV acyclovir is the treatment of choice for severe, disseminated HSV, including pneumonitis. It is recommended to continue IV acyclovir until resolution, or 14 days, at which time oral medication may be given.218\n",
