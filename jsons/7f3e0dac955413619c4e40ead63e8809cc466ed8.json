These data lead us to suggest that the astrocyte may play a central role in the neuropathogenesis of MHV infection. Consistent with this possibility, A59 has been reported to induce the expression of Class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in glial cells following infection in vivo and in vitro. In this communication, we have examined the influence of persistent infection by both A59 and JHMV on MHC Class I expression in primary murine astrocytes. Persistence was characterized by the presence of intracellular viral antigen and mRNA in the absence of detectable infectious virus particles. Under these conditions, JHMV, but not A59, inhibited constitutive expression of the H-2 Kb molecule, with the magnitude of inhibition increasing with postinfection time. A59 was not able to induce Class I during persistence, presumably due to the lack of infectious virus particles. Class I expression was restored by the addition of gamma-interferon (IFN-y) to astrocytes persistently infected with either A59 or JHMV. Thus, Class I inhibition is not a permanent consequence of JHMV persistence, and persistence does not interfere with normal signalling pathways for Class I induction.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM or JHMV) is a highly neurotropic member of the Coronaviridae, which are enveloped RNA viruses with a positive-sensed RNA genome.

Although it is well documented that A59 induces Class I expression in murine astrocytes, we have recently found that JHMV lacks this activity during acute infection (Gilmore et al., 1994) . In this communication, we report that during persistent infection, JHMV, but not A59, significantly inhibits constitutive Class 1 expression in astrocytes. In addition, A59 is no longer capable of stimulating Class I expression during persistence. Thus, Class I expression in persistent infection does in fact differ from that in acute infection by both A59 and JHMV. Interestingly, the effect of virus infection on Class I expression also differs between A59 and JHMV. However, in both cases, there is no change in the astrocyte response to IFN-y during persistent infection. We suggest that one following in vivo infection (Weiner, 1973; Haspel et al., 1978; Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Perlman and Ries, 1987) . In addition, temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of A59, which show reduced pathogenicity, also show restricted replication in astrocytes compared with that of wild type A59 (van Berlo et al., 1986) . In vitro studies support these observations, since mixed glial cell cultures and cultures enriched for astrocytes support a persistent, productive infection following both JHMV and A59 inoculation (Massa et al., 1986; Lavi et al., 1987; van Berlo et al., 1989) .

In addition, the administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for any of the structural proteins of JHMV are capable of protecting mice from lethal encephalitis, but the protection from death does not protect mice from demyelinating disease, nor does the treatment reduce virus replication in the CNS (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Nakanaga et al., 1986; Le Conte et al., 1987; Fleming et al., 1989) .

In adenovirus infection, the E l 9 protein inhibits Class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing transport to the cell surface (Andersson et al., 1985; Burgert et al., 1987) , while HCMV virions bind to P2m, causing infected cells to fail to synthesize mature Class I molecules (Browne et al., 1990) . Although the mechanism by which JHMV inhibits constitutive Class I expression is not known, there is evidence that it blocks the synthesis of host cell proteins in non-neural cells during acute infection (SA Stohlman, University of Southern California, personal communication), This block may be general, affecting all host cell mRNAs, eventually leading to death, or it may be selective, blocking the synthesis of some proteins while upregulating others.

In addition, we have found that persistent JHMV infection in the mouse oligodendroglioma, (32620, is associated with reduced MHC Class 11 expression in the absence of an effect on Class I, and furthermore, is associated with the up-regulation of mRNA specific for the myelin-associated protein CNPase (Gilmore et at., 1990) .

Just as a lack of MHC Class I expression facilitates virus persistence and limits tissue damage, an increase in Class I expression may accelerate immune-mediated, virus-stimulated tissue destruction (Oldstone, 1989) . However, mice infected with either virus eventually succumb to an otherwise seemingly identical disease. Thus, it could also be argued that A59 simply replicates more efficiently than JHMV, growing to higher titers in the CNS in a shorter period of time. In support of this possibility, recombinant viruses containing the A59 leader RNA predominate over those with JHMV leader sequence following i.c. infection with both (Lai and Stohlman, 1992) .
