The Vice-Premier reminded colleagues that the epidemic related to blood collection was firmly under control, leaving the country to deal with epidemics driven by sex and drug injection, as well as the transmission of HIV from mother to infant. She noted that some interventions in these areas had worked, mentioning specifically condom promotion, needle exchange and methadone maintenance. \"But these are only limited pilot experiments\" she said. She recognised that they remained controversial in some quarters: \"People have different views about them; there are still obstacles in understanding and more work needs to be done around implementation. But hesitation should be avoided. We must be practical, realistic and open-minded. These effective interventions must be firmly put into practice to prevent the further spreading of [the] HIV/AIDS epidemic\".",

But in some areas, there is still resistance from care providers to integrating HIV testing into routine primary healthcare. HIV testing adds to their workload, the follow-on services for care and treatment are not always easy to access at the community level and discrimination remains rife. Some worry that patients will be put off seeking treatment for other conditions if they know they'll be tested for HIV [2] . \"The will of the mass is not same as the expert's will, but it is also worthy of respect\", observed one Chinese doctor involved with HIV testing policy.",

With the extraordinary scale-up of testing, and especially with efforts to encourage those most likely to be at risk for HIV to come forward for regular tests, authorities expected that they would over time identify people in need of care much earlier in the course of their infection. As we explain below, that's important because earlier diagnosis leads to more effective treatment. Doctors estimate the progression of untreated infections by counting a patient's CD4 blood cells to determine how badly compromised their immune system is. Thinking massive targeted testing would mean earlier diagnosis; they expected to see CD4 count at first diagnosis to rise. In fact, however, it has remained stubbornly low in some groups. People infected heterosexually are especially likely to present late for testing, perhaps because they do not feel at risk and are less likely to be targeted by public health or outreach programmes than other groups such as drug injectors, sex workers or men who have sex with men.",

For years contact tracing, as this practice is known, had been considered taboo in the international HIV community; people feared that it would expose the infected partner to blame, rejection or violence. China began contact tracing in the central provinces where most people had been infected while selling plasma, a behaviour that was not frowned upon by society. They judged that offering infected partners treatment and protecting HIV-negative partners from becoming infected was justification enough for actively encouraging people to disclose their status and bring their partners for testing. When the policy was first actively promoted in 2006, the regular sex partners of around 35% people with newly confirmed diagnoses were followed up for testing. By 2012, an astonishing 90% of the spouses or live-in partners of infected heterosexuals had been tested and knew their own HIV status. Those that test HIV negative are actively encouraged to repeat the testing every year.",

            "text": "A positive HIV screening test is just the first of several steps towards HIV treatment. Though antiretroviral treatment was also provided free from 2004 under the \"Four Frees and One Care\" programme, patients had to find money to pay for up to 11 other laboratory tests before they could qualify for free treatment. The costs varied a great deal by region: one study measured them at less than US$30 in some sites and over US$150 in others [3] . National protocols required any patient with a positive result on their screening test to come back later and give blood for further testing. About a third of patients never bothered to come back [4] . Blood samples for those who did come back were sent for another screening test at a higher-level laboratory; if that test was positive, the result was confirmed by a test known as a Western blot, which is expensive and complicated to perform. It could take up to a month to go through all the steps required just to get a confirmed HIV diagnosis; in that time health staff sometimes lost contact with patients even before they could be referred to the next stage, the CD4 test. Here was another opportunity for potential patients to be lost to the system. In 2006, at the start of the treatment scale-up, just 20% of those with confirmed HIV diagnoses (and only 13% of those who had initially screened HIV positive) went on to get a CD4 count within six months. In that time, their immune systems suffered further damage, which diminished the prospect for successful treatment. A careful analysis of the national database showed that 9% of people newly diagnosed with HIV between 2006 and 2012 died within 6 months. Seven out of ten of them never got a CD4 test, so they couldn't access the medicines that might have saved their lives [5] . Figure 10 .11 in the Chap. 10 shows how dramatically that has changed. CD4 tests are important because they give doctors a good indication of how well a patient's immune system is functioning. CD4 cells are an important part of a healthy immune system, defending the body from other infections. A healthy adult will normally have somewhere between 500 and 1200 CD4 cells per millilitre of blood. But HIV attacks those cells, so that over time there are fewer and fewer left, and the body is therefore less and less able to defend itself against disease. When the CD4 cell count falls below 200 or so, people begin to suffer from things that would normally be fought off by the immune system. In the context of HIV infection, these are known as opportunistic infections: they are one of the defining characteristics of the syndrome known as AIDS. An analysis of treatment and survival among those diagnosed in the earlier years of the expansion of China's treatment programme (until 2009) found that CD4 count at diagnosis was exceptionally important in explaining who lived and who died. People who had a CD4 count of between 50 and 199 were twice as likely to die over a given year as those with higher CD4 counts (even though the sicker people were also 2.6 times more likely to be taking antiretroviral treatment). People whose first diagnosis did not come until their CD4 cells were reduced to fewer than 50 per millilitre were between five and six times more likely to die.",

When China first started to scale up HIV treatment, it offered free antiretroviral medicine to anyone whose CD4 count was below 200. That was in line with common practice in lower-income countries at the time. But with new evidence of the strong link between early treatment and survival, China's policymakers changed the rules. From 2008, anyone whose CD4 cell count was below 350 cells per millilitre of blood became eligible for treatment. In 2006, 47% of people qualified for treatment at their first CD4 test. The remainder were asked to come back for tests every 6 months until they fell below that threshold. With the change in rules, a total of 61% of confirmed cases qualified for medication. That added 5000 people to those eligible for treatment just among that year's diagnoses. The treatment threshold was raised again in 2014, so that anyone with CD4 counts below 500 -the lower limit of the normal range -could access free antiretrovirals if they met the other residence and income requirements. Finally, in February of 2016, the government announced it would get rid of the CD4 threshold entirely: anyone with a confirmed HIV diagnosis can seek treatment immediately.",

Any person who screened positive at any site in the study area was given an appointment at the local county hospital the following Wednesday. At that hospital visit, blood for confirmatory and CD4 tests was drawn, and the patient underwent a physical exam by a doctor trained in AIDS care. The doctor prescribed immediate treatment for opportunistic infections if needed. Results of the blood tests were returned to the county hospital within 48 h: hospital staff were incentivised to follow up with all patients in need of care. The results were dramatic. The time between a first positive screening test and initiation on antiretrovirals for those that needed them was roughly 2 months using the standard system. The \"one-stop shop\" system brought that down to less than 2 weeks. Under the old system, fewer than 40% of people with a confirmed HIV infection ever even started taking antiretroviral medicines, and more than one in four died within a year.

            "text": "Most opportunistic infections are cheaper to treat than HIV. But, especially in the early years of the \"Four Frees and One Care\" programme, the cost of treating secondary diseases was not automatically covered by the government. In 2004, the Ministries of Health and Finance directed local governments to pay for the treatment of opportunistic infections for those patients who could not afford it, but this instruction was implemented very unevenly. In 2005 and 2006, an international charity working in two provinces recorded what patients would have had to pay out of their own pockets if they weren't sponsored by the NGO. They showed that the expense of treating other infections ranged between US$140 and US$400 a year for patients who did not need hospitalisation and between US$1200 and US$4000 a year for patients with complex diseases that required advanced hospital care [3] . Since then, efforts have been made to expand free or subsidised treatment of other diseases associated with HIV. But former Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang said much remains to be done. Speaking a decade after that study was undertaken, he said: \"The rate of antiretroviral treatment will not be increased without treating opportunistic infections\". The reason for this is partly embedded in the incentives through which hospitals and doctors get paid. Historically, Chinese hospitals (and by extension doctors) have derived a significant portion of their income by selling drugs to patients. By introducing free HIV treatment, the government cut off a potentially important source of income. HIV is the most stigmatised infection in China, so health professionals were already reluctant to work with AIDS patients; removing the added income that they might earn from drug sales (by making antiretrovirals free) further reduced the enthusiasm of many doctors for treating these patients.",

However, the medical institutions still have to support the [rest of the infrastructure of care] because only 3-5% [of the associated cost of care] was subsidised by government\", explained Wang. \"HIV/ AIDS patients get free antiretroviral treatment in hospital. But, besides HIV, they also contract opportunistic infections, for which there is no free treatment policy. The patients may not be able to afford the treatment. Hence, not every patient can be accepted to get treatment in hospital\". The Vice Minister believed that free treatment should be systematically expanded to include opportunistic infections: \"The government should pick up the cost of both of these types of treatment. Because it is not only a personal issue; it also relates to the transmission of an infectious disease\". But he suggested that more action would be needed to resolve the problem of disincentives to treat HIV patients on the part of hospitals. \"Maybe we can solve the problem through medical and health service reform\", he said.",

HIV-infected women can pass the virus on to their infants during pregnancy, during the process of childbirth itself and during breastfeeding. Efforts to prevent this transmission start with HIV testing for pregnant women, ideally early in their pregnancy. Those identified as HIV positive should be treated with antiretroviral drugs. In addition, the newborn infant is treated with the drugs for a short period, to reduce susceptibility if they are indeed exposed to the virus. China ramped up its PMTCT programme very quickly. In 2004, only a tiny handful of pilot projects were testing pregnant women for HIV. The national programme began in 2005; by 2015, over 88 million pregnant women had been screened for HIV infection, 19 million of them in 2015 alone -or 81% of all women who were known to be pregnant in China that year. Around one in 10,000 of those women was found to be infected with HIV. A surprisingly high proportion -over half in one citywide study over an 11-year period -did not carry the pregnancy to term. Of those who did, however, very high proportions were given antiretroviral medication for both themselves and their infants. In the early years of the programme, most of the testing took place once the woman was already in labour, but over time that proportion has dropped dramatically. By 2011, eight out of ten women identified with HIV because of their pregnancy in China were being started on antiretroviral treatment during antenatal care. The programme has contributed to a 52% fall in the rate of HIV transmission from mother to child between 2005 and 2014, from 12.8 to 6.1%.",

But politically and socially, it was quite another thing to spend money on health services for adults who voluntarily took illegal and toxic substances in order to get high. Indeed HIV prevention and care services for drug injectors have been more difficult to implement than programmes for any other risk group in most countries around the world. For more than two decades, no central government funds were spent on clean injecting equipment for drug injectors in the United States because of opposition from conservative politicians. The Thai government, much praised for its pragmatic approach to HIV prevention in the sex trade, failed to reduce infection rates among drug users. To this day, infections continue to spread rapidly through shared needles in some parts of Eastern Europe. And all of this despite the fact that a few brave countries -first Scotland and then the rest of the United Kingdom, as well as Australia and the Netherlands -had shown that ensuring easy access to sterile injecting equipment for drug injectors was one of the most effective, and cost-effective, HIV prevention approaches available. Things were no different in China. Under the guise of research, the hardworking scientists described in Chap. 3 had, in fact, begun to experiment with approaches that they had witnessed in Australia and elsewhere, including needle exchange and methadone maintenance. Seeing the opportunity presented by the greater openness that followed the SARS epidemic, they rushed to present their early findings to senior policymakers, inviting them also to visit intervention sites. China's Premier, Wen Jiabao, was one of the earliest leaders to appeal for sympathetic treatment of drug users. Former Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang also reported being touched by his visits to drug users. \"Young people addicted to drugs tended to be smart and sociable, and very curious\", he observed. Noting that relapse rates were typically above 90% (and having met one drug user who was in a compulsory detoxification camp for the 18th time), he believed other approaches were necessary. \"In an open, market-based economy, drug use can't be controlled only depending on anti-drug movements or compulsory detoxification\", said Wang. \"[In Yunnan] I held discussions with the local police, and I noted that these young people did deserve to be rescued\".",

She recognised that the two behaviours thought to be driving HIV in China at the timedrug injection and commercial sex -were illegal and that reducing the incidence of the behaviours could also reduce the spread of HIV. But she called for pragmatism. \"These phenomena are hard to uproot immediately, and may persist for a considerable time. So we must combine prevention and crack-down together to deal with these persistent ailments of society\". Specifically mentioning successful pilot projects providing clean needles and methadone to drug injectors, Wu Yi appealed to people with different viewpoints to work together. \"Each district and department concerned must apply these intervention measures in a practical and rational way; must fully understand that necessary intervention measures and the crack-down on illegal behaviours share the same fundamental aim. They must stoutly and actively implement interventions, using as a standard of success whether it promotes HIV/ IDS prevention and control, and whether it helps maintain people's health and security\".",

Many believed that making clean needles and syringes available to drug injectors made it look as though the government supported illegal drug use. Methadone programmes, which give addicts syrup or pills that mimic some of the effects of heroin, seemed even worse to some people -like using public money to buy drugs for people who didn't want to quit. They found it difficult to suddenly start thinking of drug addiction as an illness, not a crime. In the end it was data, as much as politics, that led to their eventual support for effective HIV prevention for drug injectors. The small projects experimenting with making needles cheaply and easily available had reported significant success in reducing new HIV infections, as did the methadone maintenance programmes. But the eight official pilot projects testing out methadone presented some other very interesting results as well. When drug injectors were recruited into the methadone programmes, 21% of them admitted to having been involved in crime -theft, drug dealing, etc. After joining the programme, they no longer had to buy heroin every day to feed their drug habit. That meant that they no longer needed as much cash. Self-reported crime rates plummeted by four-fifths, to under 4%. The job security of drug users improved too, as did their relationship with their families [6] . In addition, they grew in confidence. A health official who accompanied Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang on a visit to a methadone clinic described the interaction between the minister and one of the clinic's clients. \"This drug user, he was on methadone, and he was chatting very happily to the minister. He said: 'For the first time in my adult life, I feel like a human being. I can even look a policeman in the eye. Before I always used to be ashamed and run away'\".",

Even those police officers who were not much interested in the health and welfare of individual drug users were happy to see less petty crime and less drug dealing. \"Involving the security services was a complete game-changer\", said Bernhard Schwartl\u00e4nder, who worked for UNAIDS at the time. \"Once there was a framework for harm reduction the PSB just got on with it\". \"Getting on with it\" happened very quickly indeed once the decision had been made to expand methadone services for drug injectors in parts of the country where heroin use was most common. Even health officials who had been pushing for an expansion of these clearly successful services were taken aback. Zunyou Wu, who was involved in evaluating the pilot programmes, remembers being asked by the Ministry of Health to get 305 clinics up and running in a matter of months. \"I said it's just not possible, we need to buy so many things, you need to have safety monitoring, it takes a lot of time to set up a clinic\". It took over a year to set up the first 101 clinics. But the pressure was on, and the team was gaining experience. \"We opened the next 204 methadone maintenance clinics in just 50 days\". Zunyou Wu shook his head at the memory of those frenzied times. New clinics have been opened every year since then; by the end of 2015, there were 785 methadone clinics in operation, including 29 mobile vans. These full service sites support another 325 satellite sites. Since 2011, these sites have been providing services to around 200,000 heroin users a year. The number of clients has fallen slightly since a peak in 2012; at the end of 2015, some 170,000 former injectors were regular clients of methadone services. For those who stay in the programme -about eight in ten clients each year -methadone maintenance is certainly working well. Newly identified HIV infections over a year fell from one person in every 105 clients in 2006 to one in 500 by 2012 and further to one in 1000 by 2015.",

Prevalence in this group has fallen by over half since the programmes were first introduced in earnest in 2005, from 7.5 to 3.6%.

Prevention services still reach only a minority of the people believed to inject drugs in China; more could be done to help get services to those who need them by helping drug users in one setting access services in another. One example is testing and notification. In line with guidance from the State Council, efforts to reduce drug use through detoxification continue in parallel with services that prioritise disease prevention. Though relapse is, in practice, the norm after compulsory detoxification, rehabilitation centres rarely refer patients to methadone maintenance services on release. HIV testing for drug users in detention and in compulsory detoxification centres continues to be routine, but not all people who test positive are routinely told of their HIV infection, meaning that they can't access care. It also means their sex partners and children, who may also need care, will not be referred for HIV testing. Analysis of the national treatment database shows that people infected during drug injection were just half as likely to be on antiretroviral treatment compared with former blood sellers by 2009; they were also much less likely to be treated compared with people infected sexually [7] . When drug users who are in contact with state services of any sort -both health and security related -are provided with counselling, HIV testing and referral for prevention and care services as appropriate, China will more rapidly reach the national goal of minimising the spread of HIV and the damage it causes to individuals and society.",

Especially worrying, from the point of view of a national epidemic, was the fact that around a quarter of male injectors reported in the earliest behavioural surveys that they regularly bought sex from women. Though there were relatively few female injectors, close to half of those that were surveyed said they supported their drug habit by selling sex [1] . By the late 1990s, it was clear to everyone that the sex trade had returned to China with a vengeance. Prostitution was especially active in border areas where men gathered in order to visit casinos in neighbouring countries -precisely the areas where the cross-border trade in heroin had already kick-started the spread of HIV. As Chap. 3 described, public health officials, researchers and even organisations such as the Women's Federation had tried out several different approaches to controlling the spread of HIV through commercial sex in the earliest years of the epidemic. When the nation's top leadership turned its attention to controlling HIV, it recognised these efforts. Vice-Premier Wu Yi noted that the trial of the \"100% Condom Use\" approach promoted by the World Health Organization had worked well. \"Actively popularising the use of condoms, we should dispense condoms for free or install condom vending machines in public places where high-risk populations are concentrated\", she declared. More than a decade later, this hardly sounds radical. But in 2004, when China's obscenity laws still prohibited condom advertising, it was a big step.",

We thought [local] health departments were not suitable for this work\". The fear was, in part, that politicians who ran health services locally might not support efforts to extend services to sex workers. Instead, the Ministry of Health proposed that epidemic prevention stations, the frontline of a public health service that was still relatively centralised, be trained to take on the task of HIV prevention in high-risk groups. They formed teams known as \"Gao Gan\", which in Chinese sounds the same as \"senior cadre\". Forming these special teams was a bold move, but necessary, according to the Vice Minister. \"At that time, gay men were under the surface of the water. So the target beneficiaries for our teams work were female sex workers. They worked mainly at night, while we were off duty in the evening. How could we get in touch with the sex workers?

That, and continuing infection with curable STIs, suggests that there is still room for expansion in the services offered to sex workers. Treating those sexual infections that can be cured is important to limit their spread and the damage they can do to a woman's health, including her ability to bear children.

At the start of that period, only 45% of the infected partners in those couples were on treatment. By 2015 that proportion had risen to 78%. In 2015, the Chinese government reported that the proportion of regular partners of heterosexuals living with HIV who acquired infection in a given year had dropped by nearly two-thirds over the previous 4 years, from 2.6 to 1.0%.",

But a good portion of the success may be attributed to the judicious use of well-chosen targets. China has always been fond of setting targets to guide performance. In the past, people setting the targets have not always thought very carefully about the effects they might have: encouraging misreporting of statistics, for example, or forcing workers to neglect important tasks which are not driven by targets in order to achieve those that are. That led to a certain amount of trial and error in all areas of government. As former Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang described, HIV was no exception. He pointed to the very first months during which methadone maintenance services were being piloted in eight clinics in 2004. \"In the months after the clinics were set up, there was actually a gradual decrease in the number of drug users [coming for methadone]\", he said. This was surprising: \"Many drug users were very poor and had to commit crimes to get money to buy drugs. Now they could spend just five to ten Renminbi [CNY5-10] per day to get methadone. So why did the numbers go down? Later, primary level medical staff told us that the local plain-clothes police waited at the entrance of the clinic and arrested the clients who came for methadone\". It turned out that the police had targets of their own. \"Because of their work targets, local police had to arrest a certain number of drug users every month and put them into compulsory detoxification institutions. It was easy for the police to find drug users at the methadone clinics\", the Vice Minister said.",

Active dialogue with a fellow Vice Minister responsible for public security saved the day. Once senior officers realised that the incentive structures for PSB officers might stand in the way of protecting the Chinese public against HIV, things changed. \"After the discussion, the Ministry of Public Security supported methadone clinics\", recounted Longde Wang. \"He even set the quarterly number of clients who attended the clinics as an evaluation of performance for local police\". It was a useful reminder of both the dangers and the advantages of setting targets.",

As health services get better at providing treatment, the targets have become more demanding: 100,000 new diagnoses in 2015 and 90,000 people newly initiated on treatment.

By 2015, the country was well on the way to meeting the ambitious goals it set for itself in 2004.
