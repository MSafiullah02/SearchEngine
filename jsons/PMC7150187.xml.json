            "text": "\nThe salivary glands of the rat include three major paired and several minor glands. The major glands are the parotid, submaxillary (submandibular or mandibular), and major sublingual. The minor glands, which are not seen grossly, include the minor sublingual, buccal, palatine, and lingual glands. Both neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the minor glands are rare in rats. Extensive physiologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural studies of the acinar and ductular epithelium of the rat salivary glands have shown their importance in maturation and functional regulation of other tissues by the production and secretion of hormonal growth factors. Only the major salivary glands are routinely examined in standard toxicological studies.",

Among the major salivary glands of the rat, the postnatal development of the submaxillary gland has been studied most extensively. At birth, these glands are composed primarily of rudimentary lobules of mesenchyme with ductular structures lined by columnar to cuboidal epithelium. Acinar development begins at birth in rats and continues until about 6 weeks postnatally. Ductular development and maturation continue for over 4 months after birth. Sodium and potassium ATPase activities in the membrane fractions of this gland increase during the neonatal period until 21 days, when levels are similar to those of adults.",

            "text": "The submandibular gland is the largest salivary gland and lies adjacent to the ventral midline of the neck. It extends to the mandibular lymph nodes rostrally and nearly to the thoracic inlet caudally. It is bordered laterally by the more coarsely lobulated parotid gland. The smaller sublingual (major) gland is located at the rostrolateral aspect of this gland just caudal to the mandibular lymph nodes. The submandibular gland is tan and has a smooth surface incompletely divided into rounded lobes of densely packed indistinct lobules. It is oval and compressed dorsoventrally with dimensions of approximately 10\u00d715\u00d75 mm. Histologically, there are four components of the parenchyma of the submandibular gland: acini, intercalated ducts, convoluted (granular) ducts, and intralobular (striated) ducts (Figure 5.2, Figure 5.3\n). The ductular system continues into the interlobular space and is composed of the excretory ducts which join to form the main excretory duct. Myoepithelial cells surround the acinar cells and intercalated ducts. They are located between the basal lamina and the epithelium and are attached by desmosomes to the epithelial cells. The acinar cells are mixtures of serous and mucous secretory cells. The cells are basophilic, with the strongest staining in the basilar portion of the cell near the nucleus. The apical area of the cell contains secretory granules. In mucous acinar cells, mucin droplets in the apical cytoplasm often appear as clear vacuoles. The ultrastructural features of the acinar cells include abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (especially in the perinuclear region), Golgi complexes, and numerous mitochondria. Peroxisomes are also found in acinar cells of both the sublingual and submandibular glands. Groups of several acini join the ductular system by narrow intercalated ducts, which are lined by low cuboidal to flattened epithelium. Oncocytes (characterized as cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, a central hyperchromatic nucleus, pleomorphic large mitochondria, and small apical secretory granules) have been reported in this portion of the submandibular gland ductular system in other strains of aged rats. The intercalated ducts join the secretory convoluted (granular) portion of the ductular system which is unique to the submandibular gland. The epithelium of this section of the duct is tall columnar. Sexual dimorphism becomes apparent in the submandibular gland by 7 weeks after birth and is characterized by a greater diameter of the secretory ducts in males. In the mature male these ducts constitute a larger percentage of the volume of the gland, have more eosinophilic secretory granules, are longer, and are lined by taller epithelium than in females. These cells are hormone dependent and testosterone-sensitive, which may account for the morphologic variations in this gland in rats (Figure 5.2, Figure 5.3). The next segment of the ductular system is the intralobular or striated duct (so named because of prominent basilar striations). Cells are tall columnar with central or apically located nuclei. These ducts enter the excretory ducts which combine to form the main excretory duct. The excretory ducts have tall columnar epithelium with more apically located nuclei and prominent cytoplasmic striations. The main excretory duct of the submandibular gland is composed of several cell types based on ultrastructural features, including light (types I and II), dark, tuft, and basal cells. The most numerous cells in the lining of the main submandibular excretory duct are the light cells. Both light and dark cells have basal membrane infoldings. As the excretory duct nears the opening into the oral cavity it expands into a diverticulum, which is lined by simple columnar to squamous epithelium. The excretory duct segment and the intralobular or striated portion actively transport sodium and potassium to the saliva.",

The acini are mucous and the ductular system is less complex than that of the submandibular gland (Fig. 5.4\n). Intercalated ducts branch directly into the excretory portion of the ductular system. A nongranulated, flattened cuboidal epithelium forms the intercalated ducts, and in the excretory ducts the epithelium is cuboidal to columnar.

It is pink to cream colored, which aids in distinguishing it from the tan-gray lacrimal gland located on its anterior dorsal border. The parotid gland is about equal in size to the submandibular gland. The intercalated ducts from each acinus join to form an excretory duct, which exits from each of the lobes. These excretory ducts join to become the main parotid duct, which is in close association with the mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve. The main parotid excretory duct crosses the masseter muscle laterally and enters the mouth near the rostral border of the masseter muscle. The parotid acini are serous and histologically similar to exocrine pancreas (Fig. 5.5\n). The lobes of the gland are divided into lobules by loose connective tissue septa, which extend between acini. Acinar cells are pyramidal and columnar with basilar nuclei and indistinct cellular borders. The cytoplasm stains basophilic in basal and perinuclear areas due to the abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, whereas it is more eosinophilic and granular in the apical region because of the zymogen granules. Argyrophilic cells located in the intercalated ducts are exocrine in function. The intercalated ducts of the parotid are important in secretion of electrolytes into the saliva. They are lined by a flattened cuboidal epithelium containing periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive cytoplasmic granules. Ultrastructurally, a subsurface endoplasmic reticular cistern is present in parotid acinar cells where unmyelinated axons extend through the basement membrane of the acini. Axon terminals located at the basilar portion of the epithelial cells are enfolded by the cytoplasm of the acinar cells.",

The glandular epithelium consists entirely of mucous cells. There are two types of buccal glands. One is found in the mucosa near the angle of the mouth and has a mucous secretion. The anterior buccal glands, which are more serous, are present in the wall of the mouth anterior to the masseter muscle. Palatine glands in the soft palate consist of mucous acini. They are closely associated with the lingual glands to encircle the pharyngeal opening. Two layers of lingual glands are within muscle bundles near the root of the tongue. Their secretions are mucous at the caudal aspect of the tongue and serous at the rostral end. The serous portions have ducts leading to the vallate and foliate papillae and to the side of the tongue, while the mucous acini lubricate the mucosa around the epiglottis.",

            "text": "The function of the salivary glands is to moisten food to begin the process of digestion. Salivation is a complex function regulated by the autonomic nervous system, the salivatory nuclei, the appetite area within the hypothalamus, and reflexes within the stomach and upper intestine initiated by nausea or ingested irritants. Saliva is a mixture of amylase, mucin, electrolytes, immunoglobulin, water, and other components. The saliva produced by the rat parotid gland is unique in that it has a protein concentration of about 2%. An extensive list of polypeptides have been identified in salivary glands of various species. A discussion of the importance of each is given by Barka (1980). Two hormonelike growth factors\u2014nerve growth factor and epidermal growth factor (EGF)\u2014have been the focus of interest and recent research efforts, especially in relation to development of neoplasia as well as normal organogenesis. Salivary gland extirpation or ductal ligation shows that these glands have broader influences on a wide range of endocrine and exocrine functions than was previously recognized. Extirpation of the major salivary glands of female rats results in fewer offspring (parotidectomized female rats eventually become infertile). Similar experimental procedures in male rats result in a decrease of plasma testosterone and total thyroxine. The parotid gland produces a hormone (designated parotid hormone) which stimulates dentinal fluid transport within the rat tooth and may prevent tooth decay. The acini and ductular epithelium have the capacity to regenerate. The regenerative acinar and striated duct epithelium of the parotid gland arises from the intercalated duct cells. The life spans of the various cells reported by Glucksmann and Cherry (1976) are as follows: secretory tubules of the submandibular gland, 95 days; submandibular acini, 65 days; sublingual acini, 60 days; and parotid acini, 41 days.",

There may be a slight increase in stromal fibrous connective tissue, and focal aggregates of adipocytes are sometimes seen between lobules and acini, similar to involutional changes in the pancreas and thymus (Figure 5.8, Figure 5.9, Figure 5.10, Figure 5.11\n). Atrophy may be the result of toxicity (see Section 7), but it is commonly seen in association with neoplasia or inflammatory lesions in the salivary gland. Necrosis of individual acinar cells and foci of lymphocytes or plasmacytes may be present. Atrophy, necrosis, and inflammation are typically seen with active sialodacryoadenitis virus infection. Atrophy is also seen with mononuclear cell leukemia infiltration of the salivary gland or local invasion by schwannoma arising in branches of the facial nerve. Mineralization of material in the ductular lumen occurs infrequently and may be seen with atrophy. Age-associated atrophic or degenerative changes similar to those in the F344 rat are seen in other strains of rats. Oncocytic cells are seen primarily in the epithelium of the intercalated ducts and occasionally in the granular ducts of aged Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats, but it is not known if they occur in F344 rats. By electron microscopy, cytoplasmic crystalloids resembling fused-unit membrane-bound secretory granules are also seen in the intercalated ducts of the parotid glands.

            "text": "Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDA V, a coronavirus) is the most important infectious agent affecting the salivary glands because of its potential to compromise the interpretation of toxicological studies. Infection with this virus often produces gross enlargement of the salivary glands and mandibular lymph nodes (unilateral or bilateral) and an increase in secretion of tears, which stain the hair on the face and around the nose. The virus causes necrosis of both acinar and ductular epithelium in the submandibular and parotid salivary glands with marked inflammation. The mucous salivary glands (sublingual) are not affected. In the early phase of the infection a neutrophil infiltrate is associated with the necrosis, but later the infiltrates consist predominantly of mononuclear cells. In severely affected glands there is nearly complete replacement of the parenchyma by inflammatory infiltrates in the acinar connective tissue stroma, with only scattered ducts remaining. Ductular regeneration is accompanied by squamous metaplasia of the epithelium. Lymphoid hyperplasia in mandibular lymph nodes is usually seen with active SDA V infection. Susceptibility to experimental SDA V infection is similiar in Wistar, Sprague-Dawley, Long-Evans, and F344 rats. A transient reduction in the amount of EGF in submandibular glands of Wistar rats occurs during experimental infection with SDA V. Intercurrent infection with SDA V during exposure to test chemicals in 2-year carcinogenicity studies conducted by the NTP had no effect on the incidences of salivary gland or other neoplasms. Another coronavirus, commonly referred to as \u201crat coronavirus,\u201d may affect the salivary glands minimally as well as the lung, although the infection is usually clinically inapparent. Current serologic tests do not discriminate between SDA V and rat coronavirus antibodies. Polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus infections may occur in the salivary glands, but no lesions have been reported in toxicological studies specifically attributed to these viral infections in F344 rats. Polyarteritis occurs rarely in the salivary glands compared with involvement of arteries at other sites, such as in the pancreas or mesentery. Other vascular and inflammatory lesions are observed sporadically and are not unique in these glands.",

            "text": "Adenocarcinoma occurs as a spectrum from the well-differentiated acinar or ductular pattern to the undifferentiated carcinoma. These are sometimes grossly apparent as an irregular nodular mass which distorts the normal contour of the salivary gland. Microscopic features vary with the cell type and the particular gland affected. Features of salivary adenocarcinomas include a high mitotic index, invasion of adjacent tissues, and variable amounts of fibrosis, hemorrhage, or necrosis. Acinar adenocarcinomas have poorly delineated lobules with no ductular structures (Fig. 5.20\n). Compression and invasion of adjacent glandular parenchyma are characteristic features. In parotid gland acinar cell adenocarcinoma, secretory granules (zymogen) may be present, although in fewer numbers than in the normal acinar cell. Adenocarcinoma with a ductular pattern may consist of invasive well-formed tubular structures with slight cellular atypia, or poorly formed tubules and invasive nodular masses of anaplastic epithelial cells (Fig. 5.20). Poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may incite adesmoplastic response in which only small acini of epithelial cells are present in rapidly expanding fibroblastic tissue resembling granulation tissue (Figure 5.21, Figure 5.22\n). These have been designated carcinosarcomas or mixed tumors in some classification schemes. Whether the mesenchymal component as well as the epithelial portion is neoplastic is an unresolved controversy complicated by evidence that the myoepithelial cell may differentiate along several pathways in experimentally induced lesions. Fibrosarcomas of the adventitia or stroma which infiltrate the salivary gland may also isolate ducts and acini while compressing and obstructing ducts, with resulting epithelial degeneration and regeneration which may resemble the morphology of a mixed tumor. Exuberant reparative changes after extensive necrosis following SDA V infection also must be distinguished from adenocarcinomas.",

Since denervation is not present, the reflex stimulation via mastication may also influence the maintenance of salivary gland structure and function. All the glands are affected by the liquid diet but the parotid gland is the most affected. Amputation of the lower incisor teeth once or repeatedly results in enlargement of the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands in rats. This enlargement is the result of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of acinar cells, which is associated with swollen nerve endings without vesicles. It has been suggested that this effect is mediated by neural regulation. A similar response is induced by sympathomimetic agonists in the submandibular and parotid glands, probably as an exaggerated physiologic response. Administration of furosemide in high doses causes atrophy of acinar cells of the salivary glands. Since hormonally induced sexual dimorphism is a normal feature of the submandibular gland, compounds which mimic or block the action of these hormones may enhance, induce, or reverse these effects, depending on their function. Apoptosis accompanied by small foci of acinar and ductular atrophy affecting both the parotid and submaxillary glands is observed with the administration of certain antihistamines. Doxylamine induces acinar cytomegaly with increased basophilic and coarsely granular or vacuolated cytoplasm within parotid gland acini. Reserpine administration results in a gradual change in submandibular acinar cells in which the mucus content is increased. This compound also affects the size and structure of the zymogen granules within the parotid acinar cells. Squamous metaplasia of the salivary gland is seen with ionizing radiation and as a component of the regenerative process after infection with SDA V or rat coronavirus. Ionizing radiation induces fibrosis and atrophy as well as squamous cell carcinomas and undifferentiated sarcomas of the salivary gland. Squamous metaplasia may also be induced by certain chemicals, including iodinated glycerol and bromoform; salivary gland neoplasms did not occur in these studies. Hypovitaminosis A also can cause squamous metaplasia, although not as dramatically as in other organs. Experimental Vitamin A deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of salivary gland neoplasms induced by DMBA compared to that in DMBA-exposed rats given a nutritionally complete diet. Squamous metaplasia of the ductular epithelium has been considered as a preneoplastic condition progressing to squamous cell carcinoma induced by several compounds experimentally, as classically illustrated by DMBA in the submandibular salivary gland. Whether the initial target cell of the carcinogen is the striated or intercalated ductular epithelial cell or the acinar cell is a subject of controversy. Arterial ligation studies suggest that several cell types may be potential targets because of the presence of cytokeratins, which was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in duct epithelium, acinar epithelium, and myoepithelium. Further evidence from electron microscopic studies indicates that squamous metaplasia occurs in both the duct and acinus and involves both the epithelial and myoepithelial cellular components.",
