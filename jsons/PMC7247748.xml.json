            "text": "Vaccination against human pathogens was first introduced in medicine in 1796 by Edward Jenner (Fig. 1). He realised that milkmaids who had suffered earlier from cowpox were not infected by smallpox, demonstrating that the inoculated vaccinia virus leads to immunological protection against the variola virus [1]. Nowadays, vaccination represents a life-saving, scientifically accepted, and low-cost procedure to efficiently avoid human infections [2, 3]. Very recently, the national German government announced a program to increase the rate of measles vaccination in the population [4]. Although prophylaxis of infections by vaccination is very effective, there is, unfortunately, only a limited number of licensed vaccines available, most of which target viruses (Fig. 1). Current vaccines do, therefore, not cover most of the infectious diseases and, on top of that, many diseases for which vaccination strategies would be desirable, are on a resurgence (e.g., whooping cough) [5\u201310]. Novel vaccine formulations or alternative approaches must be investigated and a promising way forward is the use of recombinant vaccine components, developed from, e.g., reverse vaccinology approaches [3, 11]. However, the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases including Gram-negative bacteria decelerated in the last decades. Noteworthy is that new vaccines against only three bacterial agents were developed since 1927 (Fig. 1). In this review, we focus on the immunogenicity and vaccine candidacy of trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAA) as one particular group of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria [12\u201317]",

In general, bacterial membrane proteins such as TAAs perform numerous important functions in pathogenesis, of which the first interaction with the extracellular environment in the mammalian host is of crucial importance. The extent of virulence of pathogenic organisms depends on various characteristics of both the organism itself (i.e., capacity of entering, infiltrating, and spreading through the host) and the host defence (i.e., immune status and metabolic conditions) [20\u201322]. It has become evident that TAAs play a prominent role in bacterial pathogenicity, where quick adaptation to changing conditions is crucial. As such, the modular composition of TAAs and their highly repetitive nature makes it possible for rapid adaptation to the host to occur [16, 23]. Moreover, attachment of bacteria via TAAs to the host is the first and absolutely required step in the infection process. Therefore, TAAs are highly suitable as vaccine candidates [12, 23\u201325].",

Five different type V secretion systems have so far been identified (type Va, Vb, Vc, Vd, and Ve), all of which are used to transport proteins across the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria [26, 33, 34]. The type Vc secretion system is also termed TAA. Several models for the autotransporter mechanism exist, but the details remain unknown [32, 34, 35]. After translocation, the passenger domain remains covalently attached to the anchor domain (Fig. 2a). Previously, it was thought that the translocation of the passenger domain across the outer membrane occurred without any external source of free energy (ion gradients, chaperone proteins, or adenosine triphosphate) [27]. However, recent experimental research on TAAs has demonstrated that the \u00df-barrel assembly (Bam) complex is likely to catalyse the translocation of the passenger domain across the outer membrane [36], on top of its known function to integrate the \u00df-barrel anchor domain into the outer membrane. This theory challenges the current \u2018autotransporter\u2019 hypothesis, however, does not change the fact that translocation is driven by the free energy of protein folding. The Bam complex consists of five proteins and catalyses the insertion of almost every \u00df-barrel in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria [33, 34, 37\u201340].",

For instance, it was suggested for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein subunits (e.g., gp120) that soluble stabilised trimers generate a stronger immunogenic response in mice compared to monomeric exterior immunogenic glycoproteins [45, 46]. This may be due to the higher stability of trimers in vivo, the presence of multiple, cross-linked epitopes and, in this case, the more faithful representation of the functional envelope glycoprotein complex [45]. In contrast to the type Va secretion system, the type Vc secretion system manages to expose stable trimeric polymers on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, showing its potential in future vaccine development [23].",

OMVs do not replicate, which makes them safer and thus more attractive candidates as vaccine components [56, 57]. However, they do not guarantee broad strain coverage and often mediate protection only against closely related strains [53, 58, 59].

In 1996, Noll and Autenrieth used heat shock proteins (Yersinia HSP60) with IL-12 as adjuvant in their vaccine development [76]. They suggested that microbial heat shock proteins would be promising vaccine candidates. Palmer et al. demonstrated the ability of Y. enterocolitica to modulate the immune response via OMPs [77]. More recently, the effective use of a bivalent fusion protein consisting of immunologically active regions of Y. pestis LcrV (i.e., a 35 kDa secreted protein that mediates the transport effector proteins into the host cell [71, 75]) and YopE proteins gave mice immunogenic protection upon delivery of lethal Y. enterocolitica [78]. New screening approaches for the development of vaccine candidates are still necessary, for instance, in vivo signature-tagged mutagenesis to target genes for novel virulence factors [79] or the use of reverse vaccinology to screen for antigenic OMPs.",

Different pathogenic and virulence functions are attributed to YadA in Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis [80, 85]. For example, a short amino acid sequence was identified within the N-terminal head domain of YadA from Y. pseudotuberculosis that mediates uptake in human cells and promotes binding to the ECM protein fibronectin [84]. Later, it was shown that a similar stretch also exists in distinct strains of Y. enterocolitica, but only in those of serotype O:9. There, the stretch was crucial for efficient binding of the serum protein vitronectin [86]. Furthermore, the YadA-passenger domain confers serum resistance and is important for the pathogenicity of Y. enterocolitica [30, 87]. In addition, Sch\u00fctz et al. demonstrated that the trimeric stability of YadA is crucial for full pathogenicity of Y. enterocolitica [88]. YadA itself induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) and this process is triggered via the adhesion to \u03b21-integrins [89, 90].",

They indicated that live Y. enterocolitica can prevent the host\nfrom recognising other than N-terminal epitopes of YadA. Finally, in 2017, Tsugo et al. immunised mice subcutaneously either with recombinantly expressed YadA (group 1), with inactivated Y. pseudotuberculosis strongly expressing YadA (group 2), or just with phosphate-buffered saline (group 3\u2014control). Survival rates after exposure to pathogenic Y. pseudotuberculosis were 100% (group 1), 60% (group 2), and 0% (group 3), respectively [95]. However, the recombinantly expressed YadA proteins did not induce mucosal immunity as measured by IgG secretion. The authors concluded that YadA shows promising results as a vaccine component, but more research towards its safety, immunogenicity, and protective properties is necessary [95].",

Furthermore, two genetically distinct groups of NadA exist that share only 46\u201350% identity and that do not show immunological cross reactivity [117, 118]. Group I (sharing ca. 95% sequence identity) consists of the variants NadA1, NadA2, and NadA3, while Group II (sharing ca. 90% sequence identity) consists of the variants NadA4, NadA5, and NadA6 [98, 118, 119]. Variants are classified based on their main variant group and small mutations [118, 119]. For example, NadA4 is mainly associated with carriage strains [98, 119, 120]. The crystal structures of NadA5 and NadA3 are available and provide valuable information for further investigations on their biological functions and on the effectiveness and structure of NadA as a vaccine antigen [61, 98, 121].",

In 2002, Comanducci et al. were the first to propose NadA as a vaccine candidate against MenB by demonstrating the strong inducement of antibodies upon immunisation of mice with NadA and showing protective features in an infant rat model [25]. Two years later, NadA was proven to be the only antigen out of 23 selected meningococcal proteins that elicits a strong antibody response in convalescent infant patients suffering from a meningococcal infection [123]. In 2006, Giuliani et al. described a universal vaccine against MenB that makes use of 5 antigens discovered by reverse vaccinology and aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant [124]. In 2013, the 4CMenB vaccine was approved by the EU, promptly followed by a vaccination campaign in infants in the UK [13, 96]. Summarised, NadA and its discovery via reverse vaccinology, its analysis as an essential pathogenicity factor of N. meningitidis, and the further development as a vaccine component serve as a role model to expedite the development of TAA-based vaccines.",

Hsf is not frequently mentioned as potential vaccine antigen, but Hallstr\u00f6m et al. demonstrated reduced survival of a Hsf-deficient mutant when incubated with human serum [129, 142].",

Hia is a major adhesin in NTHi strains and performs a crucial role in the infection and colonisation of the upper respiratory tract [143]. In addition, Hia is highly immunogenic in humans and a strong antibody induction was observed during naturally acquired infections [144, 145]. However, to qualify as a vaccine antigen, a broad strain coverage is required. A vaccine that comprises Hia, combined with both surface adhesins HMW1 and HMW2, would be active against 95% of all NTHi [130, 133, 144, 146]. HMW1 and HMW2 are both immunogenic surface adhesins expressed by approximately 75% of NTHi strains [130, 146]. Winter and Barenkamp demonstrated in 2017 the protective ability of OMVs, overexpressing HMW1 and HMW2 or Hia, as vaccine antigens in a rodent otitis media model [62].",

H. ducreyi is a pathogen that causes the genital ulcer disease chancroid, for which no vaccines are available [148]. Fusco et al. demonstrated the immunogenic and protective properties of a recombinant form of the N-terminal passenger domain of DsrA (rNT\u2013DsrAI), administered bi-weekly in Freund\u2019s adjuvant against infection with experimental H. ducreyi in swine [66]. It was subsequently found that the humoral immune response in mice upon intramuscularl administration of rNT\u2013DsrAI with alum is highly persistent and of superior quality and quantity compared to subcutaneous administration [149]. Furthermore, a Th2-type immune response was observed using Freund\u2019s adjuvant, alum, or imiquimod as adjuvant [149]. Nonetheless, H. ducreyi is divided into two clonal populations with varieties in the passenger domain of DsrA, meaning that antibodies recognising class I DsrA do not recognise class II DsrA [147, 149, 150].",

M. catarrhalis is a commensal coloniser of the nasopharynx and represents a causative agent of otitis media in (young) children. The role of M. catarrhalis as causative agent of COPD has long been underestimated, however, is a frequent pathogen in the acute exacerbation phase of the disease [141, 165]. Other related illnesses are meningitis, sinusitis and pneumonia [18, 162]. Diseases caused by M. catarrhalis are a serious burden for health systems worldwide [166, 167]. Moreover, M. catarrhalis produces \u00df-lactamases and is thus resistant against various important antibiotics [18]. Alternative therapies, such as M. catarrhalis vaccines, are, therefore, highly desirable [168].",

They are immunogenic [161, 173] and play an important role in serum resistance [174]. In addition, UspA1 and UspA2 are identified as one of the main targets of antibodies to surface epitopes in patients with COPD [175, 176]. Earlier, UspA1 and UspA2 were considered as promising vaccine candidates [18, 171, 173, 177]. However, a high degree of sequencing diversity in the uspA1 and uspA2 genes was demonstrated [163, 178] resulting in strain-specific differences and variable phenotypes [179]. In addition, to evade acquired immunity from the host while maintaining serum resistance and adhesive features, regions of uspA genes can swap between other uspA genes from the same strains [180]. Consequently, both TAAs lately lost major interest as potential vaccine antigens [18]. A possible solution might be to target conserved motifs of known function that are present in both UspA proteins [e.g., domains responsible for binding with ECM proteins or proteins from the carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) subfamily] [180].",

SadA, nonetheless, plays an important role in adherence to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. Large surface structures such as LPS or fimbria inhibit the function of SadA, suggesting a specific role during certain conditions in colonisation and infection of epithelial cells. Moreover, SadA is highly conserved within S. enterica strains and is considered as a positional orthologue of UpaG and EhaG in E. coli, but with some different functions [64, 204]. An\nimmunological IgG response was observed upon immunisation of mice with purified SadA (and Alum as adjuvant).

The domain structure of the four ca. 100 kDa VompA\u2013D is highly conserved, except for the major variable region in the N-terminal half of the stalk [213]. This region might be responsible for the variable phenotypes amongst the VompA\u2013D which causes diversity in adhesion specificity, e.g., expression of VompA mediates autoaggregation of B. quintana [218]. Vomps are involved in bacterial cell adhesion to endothelial HUVEC cells [219], but do not seem important for bacterial adherence to epithelial HeLa-229 and phagocytic THP-1 cells [215]. Vomps are, therefore, important virulence factors and are crucial for the course of infection [213, 218].",

For example, AhsA (designated according to gene locus ahsA) of Mannheima haemolytica A1, the principal cause of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis, promotes colonisation and subsequent infection via its ability to bind collagen and, more importantly, is suggested to be immunogenic in calves [246]. Furthermore, the TAA HMTp210 is the major hemagglutinin antigen of Avibacterium paragallinarum, which can cause infectious coryza in poultry. A variable region within HMTp210 is proposed as a candidate for recombinant vaccine production [247\u2013249]. Lastly, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae adhesin 1 (Apa1) and 2 (Apa2) are two TAAs expressed on the bacterial surface of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia. The main functional head domain, Apa2H1, activates dendritic cells and provides effective protection in mice against lethal infections with A. pleuropneumoniae by both reducing bacterial colonisation and dissemination [250].",
