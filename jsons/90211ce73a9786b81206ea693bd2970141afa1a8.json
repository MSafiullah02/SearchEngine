Nurses are ranked annually by the American public as the most trusted professionals. We are the most innovative, resilient, caring, and tenacious profession that has ever existed. Nursing will always find a way to rise and meet the challenges of tomorrow.",

We know how to use our voices as policy advocates, our eyes, and hands as competent caregivers, our minds as teachers and scholars, and our hearts to clothe these efforts in compassion, strength, and resilience. As the most disruptive innovation in 21st-century health care, nurse practitioners have a calling to provide high quality, accessible, affordable care, especially to the most vulnerable among usour children. It will take extraordinary courage to impact the issues facing pediatric health care today. As a unified profession, it will take our collective efforts, our acquired knowledge, our applied wisdom, and our unwavering dedication to fearlessly do whatever it takes to be a voice of advocacy for children all over the world.",

Nurses often put the needs of others above our own needs, to our detriment at times, being mindful of the Nightingale Pledge to \"dedicate ourselves to devoted service to human welfare\" and to do \"all in our power to elevate the standard of our profession\" (Nightingale Pledge, 1985, p. 18) .",

We wipe tears of strangers and hug broken human spirits. We care for people when they cannot care for themselves. We are calm in the face of fear. We are comfort in the midst of pain. We face difficult things straight on, head up, and eyes clear, although we take a moment to cry in the parking lot before we drive home to care for our own families.
