Based on the similarity in the genome organization between SARS-CoV and PEDV, we predict that the ORF3 protein of PEDV may have a similar function as SARS-CoV 3a. Here, we adapted the methods used for SARS-CoV 3a (10) to generate a computational model of PEDV ORF3 protein. We detect its potassium ion channel activity using Xenopus laevis oocytes and a potassium uptake-deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that virus production is reduced when using siRNA to knockdown ORF3 expression during PEDV infection. In vivo experiments also show that the existence of full length ORF3 is associated with pathogenesis. We thus demonstrate that the ORF3 protein of PEDV functions as an ion channel and enhances virus production.",

However, the leader-mRNA junction of the ORF3 subgenomic mRNA between the wild PEDV and attenuated PEDV was the same, different from Tobler and Ackermann [18]. The siRNA target sequence (TGCAGTGATGTTTCTTGGA) was chosen according to criteria previously described [19] and chemically synthesized by Ribobio (Guangzhou, China). siRNA sequence: sense 5\u2032UGCAGUGAUGUUUCUUGGAdTdT3\u2032; antisense 3\u2032dTdT ACGUCACUACAAAGAACCU5\u2032. siRNA was cotransfected at a concentration of 50 nmol with PEDV ORF3 expression plasmid (0.5 ng) into Vero cells in a 24-well plate. An unrelated control siRNA (si-NC) was included in the experiment as the negative control. After culture for 48 h, the effects of siRNA in suppressing PEDV ORF3 expression were determined by Western blot assay using anti-HA antibody. Vero cells used for virus infection were first transfected with siRNAs at different concentration by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) before being infected with the virus. After incubation for 6 h, cells were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Forty eight hours after infection, cells and culture supernatants were collected for viral production measurement.",

The four helices were then assembled in a concerted fashion to form the monomer. Bundles formed by assembling in a concerted fashion from the monomers (Fig. 1B) (11). A feature all bundles shared was helix 4 facing the pore. His-152 in TMD4 was located on an interhelical face. Tyrosines and phenylalanines appeared to be randomly distributed in all models. This finding was also observed in a side view of the bundle (Fig. 1C). Notably, a line of four phenylalanines (Phe-49, -53, -56, -60) in TMD1 faced the lipid membrane (Fig. 1C). Serines and threonines (helix 4) face the pore in bundle 1, whilst in bundle 3 threonines and lysines (helix 3) point towards the center (Fig. 1D). Based on the computational design of this experiments we propose that helix 4 is the most likely helix to be involved in the formation of the pore.",

Both ORi and high potassium solutions were used as bath solutions. HA tagged PEDV ORF3 protein expression was revealed on oocyte cell membranes through confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B). The TEVC data showed that when oocytes express PEDV CV777 ORF3, membrane current increased obviously compared to the oocytes injected with water (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in 100 mM potassium solution, oocytes expressing PEDV CV777 ORF3 show much larger currents than that in ORi (containing 90 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl) solution. These data suggest that PEDV ORF3 protein may be permeable to potassium ions. When a potassium channel inhibitor, BaCl2 was applied, the ORF3 mediated current was inhibited (Fig. 2D).

However, the growth of \u0394trk1trk2 knockout yeast in low-K+ medium can be rescued by exogenous potassium channel expression. Our data shows that all yeasts grew well on a medium with a high K+ concentration. In contrast, yeast transformed with the pYES2 vector failed to grow on a low-K+ medium, and yeast transformed with pYES2-ORF3 did grow (Fig. 2E). These yeast K+ uptake complementation results are consistent with the trace obtained using TEVC above.

In addition to pathogenesis, viroporins play a role in virus assembly and release. In the Coronaviridae, it is known that the E proteins of MHV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and IBV exhibit viroporin activity [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Our group has previously found that the protein 3a of SARS-CoV could form an ion channel and modulate virus release [10] and here we show that PEDV ORF3 gene also encodes an ion channel protein and regulates virus production.",

However, a 91aa protein encoded by the attenuated-type PEDV ORF3 is missing TM3 and TM4. The ORF3 bundle shows features of a pore lined by hydrophilic residues such as serines, tyrosines and lysines. In the TEVC experiments, it was demonstrated that the attenuated-type PEDV ORF3 was significantly reduced current activity as compared to the wild-type. Furthermore, as the model prediction, when the residue Tyr-170 in TM4 is mutated to Ala, the potassium ion channel activity was reduced in both yeast and oocytes systems. Our proposed bundle can be used for future mutation experiments that can measure channel activity.",

The 82-98del and truncated proteins (91aa protein encoded by the attenuated-type PEDV in our study) show less channel activity in both X. laevis oocytes and yeast. Only the wild-type PEDV encoding full length ORF3 protein (224aa) has high potassium channel activity. It appears that ion channel activity of the ORF3 protein is associated with the virulence of PEDV; however, the detailed mechanism of how this ion channel regulates virus production and virus pathogenesis needs further studies.",
