A comprehensive understanding of the economic burden of BPD more broadly and beyond the birth hospitalization will help inform future research on potential cost effectiveness of quality improvement efforts and interventions to reduce BPD. Thus, the purpose of this study is to quantify the incremental cost of BPD in the first-year of life by comparing VLBW infants with BPD versus without BPD in a contemporary population-based cohort.",

Gamma distribution was selected based on the modified Park test, and log link function was chosen based on the Pregibon link test, and Box-Cox transformation. The regression model adjusted for a comprehensive set of clinical risk factors that were significantly different between infants with and without BPD. Based on significance in the bivariate association, sequential regression approach was used, building successive regression models in stages. We initially started from the demographic only model, clinical risk factors were then added to the next model. The third model added an interaction between GA and BPD. Ventilation use, surgery and death were not included in order to estimate the effect of BPD as ventilation use and surgery can be considered an intermediary step in the causal pathway from the exposure variable to the outcome. The model fit was then evaluated using a likelihood ratio test and Akaike Information Criterion comparing different models. In the regression model, we adjusted for maternal age, race, parity, payer, fetal distress, chorioamnionitis, obstetrical bleeding, prolonged rupture of membranes, prenatal care, antenatal steroids, delivery mode, 5 minute Apgar score, gestational age (weeks), multiple birth, sex, small for gestational age, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), late onset sepsis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), BPD, and the interaction between BPD and gestational age. We did not adjust for birth weight as gestational age is highly correlated with birth weight and also more frequently used when counseling parents on the risks of prematurity. We also did not adjust for intrauterine growth restriction as small for gestational age is already included in the models.

In this subanalysis, infants with BPD alone still had an initial hospitalization cost of over $100,000 more than VLBW infants without any morbidities. Therefore, BPD is likely an independent risk factor for significantly higher hospitalization costs during the first year of life. Similar difference in costs between infants with and without BPD has been reported by Patel et al who found median costs of birth hospitalization in an infant with BPD as $269,004 vs $117,078 in infants without BPD and by Russell et al who found that BPD was the single costliest morbidity.(7, 15) These prior studies, however, have focused on birth hospitalization alone.",

With respect to BPD, the majority of studies have demonstrated that BPD rates have remained fairly stagnant during the past few decades.(19) While in search of the latest therapy to help reduce the rates of BPD, we must acknowledge there is variation in BPD rates across hospitals ranging from approximately 18% to 73% of VLBW infants which suggests that there is an opportunity for improvement within the current available therapies.(5) The large variation in BPD rates in similar populations suggests that there are opportunities to directly study not only what might reduce the variation and rates of BPD, but perhaps also what cost-effective strategies may be employed to treat infants with BPD. The use of early CPAP for preterm infants is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn, citing benefits from randomized controlled trials of decreased death or BPD, reduction in mechanical ventilation days, and reduction in postnatal corticosteroid therapy.(20) Our study did find that infants without BPD were significantly more likely to have any initial resuscitation with CPAP and a trial of CPAP prior to intubation (Table 2). While this may be due to some underlying patient differences, there have been a handful of published quality improvement projects that successfully showed reduction in BPD at their centers through potentially better practice bundles which often include initial CPAP use in the delivery room.(12, 21\u201323) Other potential strategies that may reduce BPD but were not captured in our study include optimization of respiratory support strategies (such as volume targeted ventilation), use of mother\u2019s own milk, and routine administration of caffeine.(24)",

However, the rates of VLBW infants have remained similar over the last several years, especially as Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) resuscitation and survival have increased. Furthermore, maternal morbidities appear to be increasing. In particular, the rate of maternal obesity has risen steeply with 1 out of 4 mothers in our cohort having a body-mass-index (BMI) of 30 or greater. Implementing strategies to reduce BPD may be a pressing need, as maternal obesity is significantly associated with an increased risk of prematurity as well as development of BPD specifically.(25\u201327) Thus a focus on prevention strategies in and outside of the NICU is even more critical. With a national estimated incidence of 15,000 infants with BPD(10), a 10% reduction in rates of BPD could roughly reduce health care costs by $150 million U.S. dollars annually in hospital facility costs associated with the first year of life alone. While some of those savings can be re-invested into quality improvement work related to BPD prevention, other can be used towards other programming and harm reduction as related to prematurity.",

The strengths include a combination of large sample size while leveraging two comprehensive databases that provide details of clinical information and costs. We must also acknowledge some limitations. First, we were only able to examine hospital facility costs for inpatient care and did not include physician fees, pharmaceutical fees, durable medical equipment (e.g., home oxygen, ventilator), costs for outpatient services (e.g., office visits), or other financial (e.g., transportation and productivity loss from work) and nonfinancial (e.g., psychological, time) impact on the family thereby largely underestimating actual cost difference between patients with and without BPD. The diagnosis of BPD was also based on a specific day of hospitalization, i.e. the very day the infant is 36 weeks CGA, and does not take into account what may happen afterwards prior to discharge. The database also did not allow us to track infants who were transferred to long-term care facilities and account for associated costs of such inpatient chronic care. All estimated costs were converted from charge data and there are potential limitations in utilizing charge to cost conversions. In addition, we had to exclude 13% of eligible infants as they had received care at either Kaiser or Shriner\u2019s Hospital in Northern California where charges were not routinely reported in our databases. However, our final cohort had a BPD rate of 33.7%, similar to previously published reports of VLBW infants.(5, 28, 29) Lastly, the generalizability of our findings may be limited to the perinatal health services in the state of California where regionalization and referral patterns may help optimize the appropriate birth of VLBW infants, which is known to be associated with decreased morbidity and mortality. In regions with less structured healthcare, the costs differences between infants with and without BPD can be further exacerbated.",
