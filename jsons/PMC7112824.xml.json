            "text": "HCoV-OC43 was identified in the 1960s and is responsible for the majority of \u201ccommon colds\u201d in humans (St-Jean et al., 2004, Vabret et al., 2003). Although HCoV-OC43 infections are generally mild, more severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, which are particularly severe in infants, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients, have been documented (El-Sahly et al., 2000, Gagneur et al., 2002, St-Jean et al., 2004). There have also been reports of clusters of HCoV-OC43 infections that cause pneumonia in adults (Vabret et al., 2003, Wenzel et al., 1974). In addition, a previous study has reported that the neurotropism and neuroinvasion of HCoV are associated with multiple sclerosis (Arbour et al., 2000). In recent years, several emerging human coronaviruses have been discovered (Skowronski et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2006), and between 2003 and 2004, the SARS-CoV outbreak caused a worldwide epidemic that had a significant economic impact in countries where the disease outbreak occurred (Skowronski et al., 2005). Phylogenetic analyses have shown that SARS-CoV contains sequences that are closely related to sequences found in the betacoronaviruses. In 2004, another alphacoronavirus, HCoV-NL63, which was isolated from a 7-month old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis, was reported in the Netherlands (Vabret et al., 2005). Woo et al. (2005) described a novel betacoronavirus, HKU1, which was found in patients with respiratory tract infections (Woo et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The RNA genomes of coronaviruses include the genes encoding the structural proteins S (spike), M (matrix), E (envelope), and N (nucleocapsid). Additionally, some coronaviruses encode a third glycoprotein, HE (hemagglutinin-esterase), which is present in most of the betacoronaviruses (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The primary function of CoV NP is to recognise a stretch of RNA that serves as a packaging signal, leading to the formation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex during viral assembly (Huang et al., 2004, Lai, 2003, Navas-Martin and Weiss, 2004, Nelson et al., 2000). Previous studies have shown that the NPs are the immunodominant domain in hosts infected with several coronaviruses (Chan et al., 2005, Che et al., 2005, Lau et al., 2004). Additionally, it has been shown that NPs can accumulate intracellularly before being packaged in mature viruses (Garoff et al., 1998). Together, these characteristics make the NP a suitable candidate for early diagnosis of coronavirus infection (Chan et al., 2005, Mourez et al., 2007).",

To generate recombinant NPs, the NP gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the plasmid pGENT using various primers. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the DNA fragments were cloned into pET28a. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-RIL cells using the heat-shock method, and the cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in Luria-Bertani medium. Protein expression was induced at an OD600 of 0.6 by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 10 \u00b0C for 24 h. After harvesting the bacteria by centrifugation (3500 \u00d7 \ng, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C), the bacterial pellets were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-buffered solution, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mM imidazole). The soluble proteins were collected from the supernatant following centrifugation (27,200 \u00d7 \ng, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C) to remove the precipitate. The methods for protein purification have been described previously (Chen et al., 2010, Hung et al., 2012). Full-length and truncated HCoV-OC43 NPs have a His6-tag at the N-terminus and the C-terminus, and the expressed proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA column (Novagen) with an elution gradient ranging from 15 to 300 mM imidazole. The pure fractions were collected and dialysed against a low-salt buffer. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with Bio-Rad protein assay reagents. The SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E NPs were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (Tang et al., 2005).",

Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using a discontinuous buffer system, and the polypeptide bands were revealed by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. For immunoblotting, polypeptides separated by SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane with transfer buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 384 mM glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3. Electrotransfer was conducted at 65 V for 1 h. The PVDF membrane was then incubated for 1 h in PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). After washing three times in PBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit antisera. The three washes were followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:10,000. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the membrane was washed three times and covered with the peroxidase substrate 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB).

CHAPS, which demonstrates low light absorbance in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, facilitates the characterisation of protein properties when using CD and UV\u2013VIS spectra. To solve the problem of the solubility of the NP, buffers containing CHAPS were used to obtain NP-His6 in a soluble form for subsequent analysis. Fig. 1A shows that NP-His6 was soluble in Tris-buffer in the presence of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4% CHAPS. Large-scale expression and purification of the His-tag NP in the presence of 0.1% CHAPS from E. coli was then performed. Fig. 1B shows that the His-tag NP was purified from the soluble fraction using Ni-NTA column chromatography, resulting in a single band of the expected mass of 55 kDa. The final yield of NP-His6 was approximately 10 mg/l from the E. coli culture. The NP is responsible for recognising a stretch of RNA that serves as a viral packaging signal, leading to the formation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex during viral assembly (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). Previous surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data showed that purified recombinant HCoV-OC43 NP can bind single-stranded RNA, suggesting that recombinant HCoV-OC43 NP is folded properly (Huang et al., 2009).",

Following three booster immunisations, the titre of antibody against full-length HCoV-OC43 NP in the rabbit serum was analysed using Western blotting. Western blot data showed that 50 ng NP were clearly detected at dilutions of at least 1:1,900,000 (Fig. 2A). The specificity and cross-reactivity of the rabbit polyclonal antibody against HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV NPs were also determined by Western blot analysis. Despite the presence of several conserved motifs in the NPs from these coronaviruses, the specificity of the anti-HCoV-OC43 NP polyclonal antibody was excellent, and the antibody did not cross-react with other human CoV NPs, including SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E at 1:150,000 dilutions (Fig. 2B). Previous studies have suggested that the NPs of CoVs share the same modular organisation (Fig. 3A) (Huang et al., 2009). The PONDR program, a predictor of naturally disordered regions, predicts three structural regions in HCoV-OC43 NP: aa 1-173 (the N-terminal domain), aa 174-300 (the central-linker region), and aa 301-448 (the C-terminal domain) (Romero et al., 2004) (Fig. 3A). To analyse the antigenicity of these three structural regions in the NP, fragments encoding aa 1-173, aa 174-300, and aa 301-448, which together span the entire coding region, were cloned, expressed, and successfully purified as single bands on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3B). The results demonstrated that the rabbit polyclonal antibody reacted strongly with the regions aa 174-300 and aa 301-448, whereas the aa 1-173 region showed low reactivity with the antibody at dilutions of 1:50,000 and 1:450,000 (Fig. 3B\u2013D). In Fig. 3C, a minor band slightly below the major band is apparent, indicating that aa 174-300 was partially degraded.",

None of the samples reacted with the SARS-CoV NP. Interestingly, approximately 81% of the serum samples reacted to the HCoV-229E NP. Thirty-eight human sera that tested positive for HCoV-OC43 NP in the recombinant protein Western blot assay were chosen for further analysis in order to examine the antigenicity of the three following structural regions of NP: regions aa 1-173, aa 174-300, and aa 301-448.

In the current study, large quantities of soluble recombinant HCoV-OC43 NP from E. coli were expressed and purified in the presence of 0.1% CHAPS. The yield from 1 l of bacterial culture was as much as 10 mg of pure NP after extraction and column chromatography. The ability of the recombinant HCoV-OC43 protein to bind the intergenic sequence of the RNA genomic leader by SPR was examined (Huang et al., 2009). These results, which showed efficient binding of HCoV-OC43 to the RNA, suggest that the purified recombinant NP was folded properly. The prokaryotic expression system used in this study is high-yield, inexpensive, and highly efficient, does not require viral cultures, and is nontoxic. Despite these advantages, viral proteins expressed in prokaryotic cells lack post-translational modifications that are present in proteins expressed in baculovirus expression systems (Mourez et al., 2007).",

            "text": "HCoV-OC43 is distributed worldwide (Patrick et al., 2006). Indeed, the results presented in this study showed that approximately 90% of serum samples from young adults and middle-aged and elderly patients with respiratory infections reacted strongly to the HCoV-OC43 NPs, indicating prior exposure to this disease. This finding is consistent with previous epidemiological surveys that concluded that seroprevalence increases rapidly during childhood, attaining a seroprevalence rate of up to 90% in adults (Lehmann et al., 2008, Mourez et al., 2007). Additionally, antibodies against HCoV-OC43 NP were detected in over 90% of cord blood samples tested. Maternally acquired antibodies may help protect a newborn baby from HCoV-OC43 infection, although this protection appears to wane by 4\u20135 months of age. In addition, 81% of serum samples tested in this study were seropositive for the HCo-229E NP. The reactivity of the serum samples to the HCoV-229E NP is most likely due to a prior infection with HCoV-229E or the cross-reactivity of the serum to the conserved region within the NPs (Che et al., 2005). In 2004, a new coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, belonging to the betacoronaviruses, was identified (Pyrc et al., 2004, Vabret et al., 2005). HCoV-NL63 is a coronavirus that is also identified frequently in respiratory tract infections and is reported most frequently during the winter season. The epidemiology and characteristics of infection for this virus do not differ significantly from those described for HCoV-OC43. Cross-reactivity between the OC43 and NL63 HCoVs could not be excluded in the current study, due to the lack of a modified, culturable strain in our laboratory.",

            "text": "CoV NPs contain multiple immunodominant epitopes and antigenic sites (Yu et al., 2008, Zhao et al., 2007). To compare the immunoreactivity of the three structural regions of HCoV-OC43 NP, three truncated recombinant fragments (aa 1-173 (the N-terminal domain), aa 174-300 (the central region), and aa 301-448 (the C-terminal domain)), were produced in E. coli; these regions were chosen based on PONDR predictions. The reactivities of a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody and human serum against these fragments were determined by Western blotting. It is commonly accepted that Western blot is the most effective method for unequivocally locating linear or continuous immunodominant epitopes (Mourez et al., 2007, Pohl-Koppe et al., 1995). The rabbit polyclonal antibody generated in this study reacted strongly with the central region and the C-terminal domain of the NP, whereas the N-terminal domain demonstrated low reactivity with the antibody. According to protein sequence alignment, the NP of HCoV-OC43 contains 27% to 30% sequence identity with various other animal coronaviruses. To minimise possible cross-reactions between the NPs of HCoV-OC43 and other human coronaviruses, a minimally derived region encoding the NP that could be detected efficiently by all human sera was sought. Three types of immunoreactivity patterns had been found in human sera, suggesting that there was variability in the immune responses occurring in humans during HCoV-OC43 infection. In the Type I immunoreactivity pattern, which had a similar reactivity as the rabbit serum, the immunodominant region was located in the aa 174-300 and aa 301-448 regions. This result was consistent with previous studies conducted with sera from SARS patients, which revealed that the immunodominant regions were located in the middle and C-terminal regions of the SARS-CoV NP (Lee et al., 2008, Yu et al., 2008). In the Type II immunoreactivity pattern, the immunodominant region was located in the aa 174-300 region, while in the Type III immunoreactivity pattern, all of the three structural regions showed strong antigenicity. According to previous circular dichroism and SPR studies, the central region is necessary for the disorder conformation and has been shown to have RNA-binding activity (Huang et al., 2009).",
