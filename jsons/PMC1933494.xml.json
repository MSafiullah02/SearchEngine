            "text": "Humoral immunity plays a significant role in the control of HCMV infections and disease in man in that HCMV-neutralizing antibodies interfere with the receptor-mediated virus entry into susceptible cells. HCMV gB has been shown to be a major target of neutralizing antibodies induced by naturally acquired infection (Britt et al., 1990, Gonczol et al., 1991, Marshall et al., 1992). Although antigen binding ELISAs can measure antibody specific for HCMV antigens such as the gB protein, only an assay in which neutralization of viral entry into cells is measured can establish and quantify the biological activity of HCMV antigen specific antibodies. Our goal was to develop a HCMV microneutralization assay that is suitable for screening a large number of serum samples from vaccine clinical trials. Vical is currently testing HCMV pDNA vaccine candidates encoding the ectodomain of gB from AD169. This pDNA vaccine has been shown to induce specific antibody responses, as measured by ELISA, in animals (Selinsky et al., 2005) and humans (Wloch, in preparation).",

The availability of mAbs specific for the early gene products of HCMV has enabled the development of assays that can detect HCMV infection much faster (Gleaves et al., 1984, Griffiths et al., 1984, Alpert et al., 1985). The first overnight assay to detect HCMV infection or measure its neutralization used 24-well cluster plates with fibroblasts as indicator monolayers and a commercial mAb specific for HCMV IEA coupled with immunoperoxidase staining to detect cells infected with the HCMV lab strain AD169 or clinical CMV isolates (Chou and Scott, 1988). The first rapid HCMV neutralization assay developed for 96-well microplates (Andreoni et al., 1989) used immunofluorescent staining of infected cells for IEA and required manual counting of stained nuclei under a fluorescence microscope. Although the microplate format enables simultaneous testing of multiple samples and the assay endpoint can be reached within 24 h, the manual counting of the labeled images makes this technique slow and tedious and thus limited to small scale use.",

In a modified version of this assay, virus and sera are preincubated for 4 h and the virus\u2013serum inoculum is incubated with the indicator cells for 16 h (Schoppel et al., 1996, Klein et al., 1999. In a direct comparison of these two methods, a 4-hour virus/serum preincubation time in combination with a 14\u201318-hour incubation without removal of the virus resulted in a far better distinction between neutralizing and non-neutralizing sera than a 1-hour virus/serum preincubation time in combination with a 4-hour incubation of cells with the virus/serum inoculum before removal (Fig. 2\n). Our results also confirm the observation made by Klein et al. (1999) that human sera diluted less than 1/50 can have a non-specific toxic effect on infectivity, mimicking neutralization (Fig. 2). For all further experiments, a 4-hour virus/serum preincubation time followed by a 14\u201320-hour incubation was used. To avoid non-specific inhibition of infectivity and thus ensure high assay specificity, 1/50 was the lowest dilution used for assaying human sera.",

The standard wells contained more infected cells than the Half Area wells (mean infected cells \u00b1 S.D. values were 861 \u00b1 288 and 522 \u00b1 64, respectively), because they received twice as many plated cells and twice the virus input.

A similar detection method had also been used in combination with the substrate AEC to titer HCMV and measure neutralizing antibody (Chou and Scott, 1988). Later, the immunofluorescent microassay was also modified for immunohistochemical staining and the substrate DAB was used to measure the neutralization of rhesus CMV by macaque serum ((Lockridge et al., 1999). Alternatively, others used the modified Andreoni assay with AEC to quantitate neutralizing antibodies in the sera of mice vaccinated with AD169 dense bodies (Pepperl et al., 2000). In all of these approaches, nuclear images were counted by an analyst using a microscope.",

(2004a) used a microplate spectrophotometer to measure fluorescence emitted by cells infected with EGFP-expressing recombinants of the Towne or Toledo strains of HCMV in their version of an HCMV microneutralization assay. Alternatively, they used a digital camera to capture the fluorescent images and an image processing software for data analysis. However, a neutralization assay based on intrinsic fluorescence is limited by the availability of the appropriate HCMV recombinant. Furthermore, a minimum 5-day post-infection cultivation time was needed for the cells to produce signals quantifiable by microplate spectrophotometry and edge effects made the outer 36 wells of a 96-well microplate useless for the assay (Wang et al., 2004a). Andreoni et al. (1989) also reported that the outermost columns and rows yielded uninterpretable results in their microassay and thus were used only as an evaporation barrier. This phenomenon may be specific for fluorescent detection, because in our assay we can use all 96 wells of a microplate. However, we strategically position our controls and the test samples across the plate, to minimize the potential influence of well location on our results.",

Cheong et al. (2003) used an ELISPOT approach to titer stocks of a recombinant virus expressing human IL-2 by plating infected cells onto anti-IL-2 Ab coated ELISPOT plates. In a novel application for a neutralization assay for the SARS coronavirus, an ELISPOT analyzer was used to count whole cells actually growing on ELISPOT plate membranes and infected with a pseudovirus, which also encoded a Lac Z gene that made cells blue upon staining with X-gal (Han et al., 2004). Our HCMV microneutralization assay appears to be the first to use an automated ELISPOT analyzer for quantitating immunostained cell nuclei. In our experience, the use of ELISPOT plates for this purpose is unnecessary and increases the assay expense. In a study in which we compared several microplate types, including MultiScreen-HA cellulose ester and MultiScreen-IP high protein binding hydrophobic Immobilon-P ELISPOT plates (Millipore, Burlington, MA), neither the HA cellulose ester ELISPOT plates nor white opaque tissue culture plates (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA) showed any advantage over standard clear tissue culture plates (NUNC) (data not shown). By employing an automated ELISPOT analyzer, we have made the counting of stained nuclei not only more convenient but also less prone to human error and thus more objective. Our results indicate that curve fitting of data, and with it the accuracy and sensitivity of the assay, improves with increasing viral load, which can be critical when assaying sera that have little neutralizing activity. Because the ImmunoSpot Analyzer can count a whole 96-well microplate with over a thousand stained nuclei in each well in about half an hour, our assay can easily be run at a high viral input with a high level of accuracy.",

MRC-5 human embryonic fibroblast-like cells have long been used interchangeably with primary fibroblasts for the detection of HCMV in cell culture (Swenson and Kaplan, 1985) and MRC-5 were even found superior to HFF in shorter (24 h versus 48 h) cultures (Gleaves and Meyers, 1987). Lately, MRC-5 cells have been used in neutralization assays as well (Wang et al., 2004b). In our hands, MRC-5 cells performed very inconsistently as indicator monolayers for neutralization analysis. Although they were readily infected and expressed the IE1 protein, the quality of the monolayer varied largely and unpredictably together with the extent of background staining, which affected the automated data acquisition detrimentally (data not shown). Prompted by a report that showed MRC-5, HEL, and WI-38 cell lines and primary HFF equally reliable (overall 100% sensitive and 97.4% specific) at detecting HCMV in urine, (as used by various clinical laboratories; Demmler et al., 2000), we compared the cell lines in our assay. Although all three cell lines could be infected equally well with AD169 and yielded comparable neutralizing activity values for several test sera, the culture and staining characteristics of HEL-299 cells were much better than those of MRC-5 and WI-38 cells. HEL-299 cells provide more uniform indicator monolayers and are hardier than MRC-5 and WI-38 cells, ultimately improving the robustness of the assay.",

We have found that the Half Area plates are beneficial at multiple levels: they require not only fewer cells but also less reagents and virus than regular plates while yielding better data. The apparent superiority of the Half Area plates over the standard plates in our assay likely is the combined result of the indicator cell monolayer being more sheltered from or less disturbed by the necessary manipulations during assay and the nuclear images likely being counted more accurately. Half Area plates require scanning and counting at a higher magnification than standard microplates, which makes the nuclear images better defined.",
