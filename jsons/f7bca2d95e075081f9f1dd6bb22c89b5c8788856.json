These stakeholders are dynamic and likely to change during the course of the process. Some are constant, while others come and go, and others may join in at different stages of the process. Therefore, it is important for the organization to engage with these stakeholders. Stakeholder participation in the risk management process is becoming increasingly recognized as a means of producing decisions that are responsive to the varying interests and values (Jardine, 2008) . The benefits of engaging stakeholders are many and include a better understanding of the risk, building trust and credibility as stakeholders feel involved in decision-making and actions affecting their future, stakeholders feel that their interests are taken seriously by the organization. Engagement generates mutual understanding and sharing of responsibility if things go wrong. It also allows risk stakeholders to express their opinion on the risk and the actions taken by the organization to address it, as well as its potential outcome. Engaging with a variety of stakeholders provides a platform for different voices to be heard. Different risk stakeholders can be consulted at different stages of the risk management process.",

It is an integral aspect of a risk management process, which requires different forms of communication and information activities at different stages and levels of the process directed at specific target risk stakeholder groups. Risk communication can be defined as \"any public or private communication that informs individuals about the existence, nature, severity, or acceptability of risks\" (Plough & Krimsky, 1987, p. 6) . The perspective on stakeholders (audiences) is embedded in definitions of risk communication, be they source-or sender-oriented definitions focusing on conveying or transmitting information, from the risk assessors to the stakeholders, or interactive process definitions focusing on the exchange of scientific information between interested parties (Covello, Winterfeldt, & Slovic, 1987; Infanti et al., 2013) . Exchange of information is understood as an attempt to define risk communication as an audience-oriented activity in which the source customizes scientific information to the questions and needs of target groups in the public (Gutteling & Wiegman, 1996) . Risk communication can be understood as a dynamic and interactive process involving exchanges between different stakeholders. It can either be a planned or unplanned communication with stakeholders, or what has been referred to as 'interested parties', about the nature, possible consequence and management of risks.",

Crucial to risk management is not only recognizing the problem, but also communicating the risks to the key stakeholders. Risk management processes would be futile if internal stakeholders were not included in the processes. The same applies to the sharing of risk information in interorganization networks, especially crisis management organizations like the police, defence and security. In analysing risks and solutions, risk managers should also consider how the chosen solutions would affect stakeholders. The risk decision processes thus involve different ways of engaging and accommodating internal and external stakeholder interests. Communication skills for persuading different stakeholders, convincing conflicting stakeholder interests, reaching compromises and satisfaction of the key stakeholders are fundamental to effective risk communication. Risk management solutions are likely to fail if stakeholder groups feel that they have not been properly informed.",

Such warnings include instructional communication as to how to deal with or avoid the hazards. The goal of such communication is to avoid or minimize the consequences of the hazards.

Covello et al.

It entails persuasive efforts by risk communicators to change the behaviours, attitudes and opinions of specific groups or stakeholders regarding a risk issue. Miller (1980) defines persuasive communication as any message that is intended to shape, reinforce or change the responses of another or others. Persuasion includes \"any effort to modify an individual's evaluation of people, objects or issues by the presentation of a message\" (Petty & Cacioppo, 1987, p. 25) . Persuasive communication emphasizes the notion of change, be it change of attitude, behaviour, habits, emotions or beliefs about an issue. Hence any message that is intended to shape, reinforce or change the responses of another, or others, will be defined as persuasive communication (Stiff, 1994, p. 10) . Several strands of research from different disciplines such as behavioural science, psychology and political science exist in message effect studies. The message effect research of the 1960s attempted to define the characteristics of persuasive messages. In his book Persuasive Communication, James Stiff describes some of the prominent strands in message effect studies:",

Emphasis of communication is placed on the quality of evidence that is offered to support the conclusion. Rational persuasion emphasizes the importance of supporting information. However, the persuasiveness of the message is dependent on the motivation and ability of the recipient to process the message contained in the message (Petty & Cacioppo, 1987) . Stakeholders who are motivated and fully engaged with the risk issue are more likely to fully scrutinize the message than those who are less engaged. Different stakeholders engage differently in risk issues and hence the importance of adapting the message to the degree of engagement. The degree of stakeholder engagement and their ability to interpret the message is a determinant factor in the understanding of the message and the attitude to change. As such, rational persuasion techniques require that the targeted stakeholders make an active effort in receiving and processing the risk message.",

Emotional appeals tap into the subconscious as opposed to the conscious mind. This approach uses manipulation of the emotions to influence the message recipients. This approach is used in different fields including marketing and advertising, where communicators target the subconscious mind through eye-catching adverts. Fear appeals have been used in prevention and safety campaigns, such as Don't Drink and Drive campaigns, the use of seat belts, cigarette smoking and HIV/Aids. In these campaigns, fear-arousing messages, often accompanied by gruesome images, have been used to motivate the target groups to change their behaviour or attitude.",

            "text": "One of the biggest challenges facing risk communicators is to motivate, persuade or influence stakeholders on matters of risks. As noted in Gutteling and Wiegman (1996) , to some risk communication researchers, especially those who hold an implicit technical view of risk communication, there is no problem in trying to reach agreement between the source and the receiver by applying persuasive tools. Other researchers, however, argue that using persuasion communication strategies is not acceptable and contradicts the goals of fairness. More recently, there has been a shift in the understanding of risk communication from merely a one-way communication flow to an emphasis on a two-way communication process involving sharing of information and promoting dialogue between technical experts and stakeholders. This approach acknowledges the concerns of stakeholders. Properly applied dialogue-based risk communication can help stakeholders and experts to share knowledge and understanding of the risk issue. Dialogue is aimed at ensuring that a diverse range of people share a common understanding of the risk issue with the organizations/ individuals in charge of managing the risk concerned. Sandman (1989) argues that the principle of involving the public in risk issues, whether it is risk assessment, decision-making, management or communication, is crucial. The aim of dialogue-based risk communication is to bring together diverse stakeholders in risk knowledge creation and sharing. This approach recognizes that certain risks are complex and multidisciplinary and hence need to be addressed through dialogue with, and participation by, diverse stakeholders. Increasing stakeholder participation raises the likelihood of the message being credible. There is a growing realization by risk researchers that for risk communication to be effective, it should have a stakeholder perspective. Dialogue-based perspectives are captured in the definition of risk communication by Lang, Fewtrell, and Bartram (2001) : \"[R]isk communication is any purposeful exchange of information about risks between interested parties.\" In their 'General Principles of Food Safety Risk Management', the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) hold that \"risk management should include clear, interactive communication with consumers and other interested parties in all aspects of the process\". In its project to investigate what type of communication would improve the public understanding of flood risk and encourage people to take action, the British Environment Agency (2015) carried out a major public dialogue project on flood risk communication. In its project evaluation it found that \"getting people and communities involved in talking about flood risks increases people's understanding of local flood risk and can help them on a journey towards making preparations to protect themselves against flooding\" (Environment Agency, 2015).",

It recognizes the stakeholders' divergent values, beliefs and needs.

The stakeholders, the risk information (message), the channels and the customizing of risk information to the audiences' needs are necessary for more adequate risk communication (Gutteling & Wiegman, 1996) . Blanchard-Boehm (1998) proposes a model that presupposes that the process of risk communication is one whereby individuals (1) hear a warning message; (2) understand its content; (3) internalize or believe the salience of its message; (4) confirm their interpretation with others and (5) act or respond to its message to save their life and property. Morgan and Lave (1990) argue that risk messages must be understood by the recipients, and their impacts and effectiveness must be understood by the communicator. A persuasive message is more likely to be effective if the communicator is credible, trusted (depends on qualification and identification), and knowledgeable (expertise). Atwood and Major (1998) argue that individuals who have experienced predictions of disasters that do not materialize will discount the validity of subsequent disaster warnings. The trustworthiness of the sender of a risk message, that is, using trusted sources of information, will enhance the public's compliance with risk messages. Important components of trust include openness, honesty, responsiveness, accuracy, fairness and concern. In addition, the risk message should be tailored to intended audiences, taking into consideration their linguistic skills. The readability of the risk messages should match the target audience's comprehension levels. The choice of message delivery modes should be informed by the target audience's communication habits.",

(Powell & Leiss, 1997, p. 30) Success in risk communication is achieved when an organization has succeeded in communicating risk information to intended stakeholders, thereby earning stakeholder trust, and most importantly avoiding the development of a risk information vacuum. Effective risk communication also involves the ability of an organization to persuade segments of stakeholders. Powell and Leiss (1997) note that statements about risks by various parties are treated as \"messages\" intended to persuade others to believe or do so something. This perspective is linked to persuasive communication, and risk situations ought to be regarded as acts of persuasive communication, that is, as messages intended to persuade a listener.",

The crisis necessitates identification of possible risks (including all types of threats and stakeholders associated with the crisis). After identifying and analysing the risk issue, the organization has to decide how it intends to frame the issue. Framing is the way information is presented. To frame \"is to select some aspects of perceived reality and make them more salient in the communication text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation and/ or treatment recommendation\" (Entman, 1993, p. 52) .

However, trust alone is not enough. There are other socio-political factors to be considered. As Abraham (2009) argues, \"as experiences of SARS and H1N1 outbreaks have shown, outbreak control and outbreak communication is rarely a pure, clean process of winning public trust and transmitting information objectively and openly\" but more often a messy business requiring political decisions with winners and losers (p. 604).

The risk of transmission elsewhere in the world and the perceived consequences for those affected attracted a lot of attention from different actors, both governmental and non-governmental organizations, at national, regional and global levels-all with different interests in the outbreak. A number of voices strove to be heard on both the oral and modern communication platforms. Communication platforms were quickly flooded with messages, and amidst this maze, turmoil ensued. Communication was hence identified as being one of the major issues of concern during the Ebola outbreak. An information crisis prevailed as stakeholder groups, in particular those affected by the crisis, grappled with sources of information to trust, amidst a sea of misleading or misinformed material. Unclear, inconsistent and conflicting messages emanating from many authorities (i.e. government, traditional leaders and religious leaders), some of which were mistrusted, compounded the situation. As such, early messages concerning Ebola were met with both fear and denial by many communities.",

It also noted that the early messages designed to change behaviour were counterproductive as they failed to take into account cultural practices and beliefs. The message to the public may simply be public information that is required for people to protect themselves, for example, from the disease and reduce the risk of transmission, but then in a context characterized by many voices (with different cultural backgrounds) and many communication channels (both oral and modern), the messages reaching the public were sometimes incomprehensible and contradictory. Cultural factors also had a bearing on whether those messages were acted upon. The chaos in the communication of risk in West Africa can be attributed to the failure to integrate local knowledge and voices into the formulation and communication of risk knowledge.",

Communicating with stakeholders during the outbreak of foodborne diseases, that is, those threats posed by contaminated food, pathogenic bacteria and viruses, presents a series of challenges. These include the consistency of the messages, their persuasiveness and the stakeholder characteristics. Food chain security is a highly complex issue often involving a multitude of stakeholders. The whole national economic sector of food production and distribution is vulnerable to a local accident (Brunet & Houbaert, 2007) . The stakeholders involved are not monolithic blocks but very dynamic entities. In their study of the Belgian fowl pest crisis, Brunet and Houbaert (2007) note how during the fowl pest crisis, a new group of influential stakeholders emerged: stakeholders who were not used to communicating with public authorities responsible for the food chain. The authorities, for their part, were not quickly able to establish a valid understanding of these stakeholders during the crisis. \"Unless the stakeholders likely to be implicated in any crisis are explicitly recognized, therefore, it is likely that some of those who need to be protected from the adverse consequences of the event will be neglected or poorly served\" (Brunet & Houbaert, 2007, p. 647) . In light of the crossborder dimensions of food safety, there have been efforts at international level to coordinate food risk messages. For example, the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) connects national authorities from around the world. Its objective is to prevent the international spread of foodborne disease by promoting the rapid exchange of information during food safety events, sharing information on food safety issues and promoting collaboration between countries.",

The dominant focus in these one-way models was on the experts (government and health institutions) disseminating messages about health threats to the public, conceived as being passive. This understanding was underpinned by the 'effect studies' tradition, such as hypodermic needle theory (also known as the magic bullet theory), which suggested that the mass media could influence the masses directly by 'shooting' or 'injecting' them with appropriate messages designed to trigger a desired response. These theories suggest a powerful and direct flow from the sender to the receiver, in our case from health authorities to the public.",

The interactive perspective on health risk communication moves beyond the old view of a passive receiver and instead focuses on how health risk messages can elicit different responses depending on (a) who communicates them, (b) how they are communicated and (c) how the public actively processes the information (Lemal & Merrick, 2013) .

Scientists and policymakers often complain that the media misrepresent risk statistics and distort the facts, by, for example, giving a platform to scaremongers and mavericks and seeking out \"doom-laden scenarios\" (Kitzinger, 1999) . This has been particularly the case in the coverage of health pandemics. The media reporting on health pandemics such as bird flu, SARS and so on bears testimony to the increased competition to frame the risks. It is often the negative frame (lives likely to be lost) that reaches the public domain rather than the positive frame (lives likely to be saved). In reporting risk in health, the media do not operate in the same way as (or necessarily reflect the mainstream views of) doctors, scientists, researchers or health officials in presenting information to the public (Greenberg, Sachsman, Sandman, & Salomone, 1989; Kitzinger, 1999; Rothman & Lichter, 1987) . The media play a significant role in raising risk awareness, engaging the public in debate, investigating alternatives and promoting transparency and inclusive communication policies. Different groups of stakeholders interpret risks differently, and so do the media. There are dangers, therefore, of a risk gap developing between an organization and its stakeholders due to media framing.",

The media play a pivotal role in the communication of risks, by influencing who communicates and what is communicated. They play an important role in communicating health risk information and in shaping the perception of stakeholders. Advances in new media have dramatically changed the role of risk communication, impacting on how organizations interact with their internal and external stakeholders. The implications of these changes to risk communication is that \"the number of people and speed of diffusion has created unparalleled challenges as our social media obliterates hierarchy and perhaps creates a 'flat' or 'nobody in charge' world\" (Ratzan, 2014 (Ratzan, , p. 1327 . Risk information from different stakeholder perspectives and from the organization can easily be disseminated through new media.",

As such, risk management after crisis integrates most of the pre-crisis risk management processes cited earlier.

For risk communication to succeed, it is imperative that the communicator understands the stakeholders and how they perceive the potential risk. Identifying, assessing and segmenting the stakeholders, understanding their concerns and perceptions, would enable the communicator to design better risk communication strategies. It would enable the communicator to design better risk messages, customize messages for specific target groups and ensure that stakeholders receive relevant messages. It is equally important for the communicator that the stakeholders want to be involved. One-way forms of communication, in which the stakeholders are mainly seen as receivers of information from experts, are no longer considered acceptable. Risk communication is now a two-way form of communication, with emphasis on interaction and dialogue between an organization and its stakeholders. Hence communications that enhance interactions, elicit responses and generate dialogue are preferable. Openness (e.g. involving representatives from affected stakeholders) enables an organization to get input from outside the organization, thereby improving the quality of interactions. A dynamic, flexible risk communication approach that involves stakeholders at every possible stage can enhance the effectiveness and credibility of risk communication throughout the crisis management cycle.",
