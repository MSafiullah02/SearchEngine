Abbreviations: AU, arbitrary unit; IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M. IgM titer (Table 2 and Figure 1). In these patients, two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests were negative and the chest computed tomography findings indicated improvement. Considering this, their antibody titers and consistent clinical manifestations suggested that antibody detection could act as an indicator of the stage of COVID-19 progression and that the antibodies in convalescent patients are not always maintained at a high level. The immune status fitted both, the clinical and general characteristics of the humoral response. In one report, while 38 patients in the acute phase of the infection tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 31 (81.6%) of them tested negative for IgM and IgG in serological assays, 4 thereby demonstrating that these patients were in the early stages of infection, as both the antibody titers were relatively low (Supplemental table 1). COVID-19 patients will develop immunity after recovery; however, the persistence, attenuation, and duration of protection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies requires further investigation. 5 Presently, data regarding the COVID-19 spectrum are mainly focused on clinical infection with respiratory symptoms. The proportion of subclinical infections and atypical patients remains unknown. Antibody detection will help in the profiling of the COVID-19 spectrum. Epidemiological surveys of serum antibody levels in the population would help in fully understanding how many people have ever been infected. This information will allow the determination of the proportion of different types of infected individuals and a profiling of the complete disease spectrum of COVID-19. High virus volumes and transmission have been reported in the asymptomatic phase. 6 By combining the results of RNA and antibody testing, we can further identify the contribution of different types of infected people (especially the atypical ones and those with subclinical infection) in the spread of the virus and the disease. This will provide a key scientific basis for the discovery and management of infectious sources.",
