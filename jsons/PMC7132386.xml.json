Although the components of the MALT are anatomically and functionally distinct, they share traits such as organized inductive sites where T cells are presented antigen via antigen-presenting cells (APCs). As with other animals, the majority of porcine pathogens gain entry into the body through mucosal surfaces when ingested or inhaled from the feed, the environment or from fecal contamination. Systemic vaccinations (through intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous routes, etc.) generally do not promote mucosal immunity and therefore the animal's immune system can only combat the pathogen after it has gained entry into the body (Mestecky, 1987, Mestecky et al., 1978, Murtaugh, 2014). Thus, because mucosal immunity has the potential to control pathogens at their point of entry, it would be advantageous to develop vaccines that trigger a strong mucosal and systemic immune response rather than simply stimulating the systemic immune system.",

            "text": "For induction of a local mucosal immune response, in the gut for example, antigen is taken up by intestinal DCs which migrate to the mesenteric lymph node (mLN) and lead to antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes activation (Annacker et al., 2005, Fujimoto et al., 2011, Johansson-Lindbom et al., 2005, Schulz et al., 2009). Upon activation, lymphocytes undergo proliferation and differentiation and, in most mammals, these activated clonal lymphocytes exit the mLN via the efferent lymph where they drain into the thoracic cavity and enter into the circulation. The pig has inverted lymph nodes and therefore immigration into the lymph node tissue takes place either by afferent lymph vessels or by high endothelial venules (HEV) and they emigrate directly into the circulation through HEV (Binns and Pabst, 1994, Rothk\u00f6tter, 2009). Once in the circulation, the majority of activated lymphocytes home back to site where the antigen was initially encountered (Kiyono and Fukuyama, 2004, Kunisawa et al., 2008, Lefrancois et al., 1999, Svensson et al., 2002).",

            "text": "DCs play a critical role in regulating expression of homing molecules on the surface of activated lymphocytes (Johansson-Lindbom et al., 2003, Stock et al., 2013). In the intestine, migratory CD103 + CD11c + MHCII+ DCs produce retinoic acid (RA) which promotes the expression of \u03b14\u03b27 and CCR9 on activated lymphocytes in mice and humans (Campbell and Butcher, 2002, Johansson-Lindbom et al., 2005, Johansson-Lindbom et al., 2003, Mora et al., 2003, Mora et al., 2006, Stagg et al., 2002, Stock et al., 2013, Yokota et al., 2009). The receptor for \u03b14\u03b27, MadCAM, is highly enriched on the endothelium of the vasculature supplying the small intestine such that lymphocytes bearing \u03b14\u03b27 undergo extravasation in these post-capillary venules (Berlin et al., 1993). CCR9+ lymphocytes in turn home to the small intestine epithelial cells that constitutively express the CCR9+ ligand, CCL25 (Kunkel et al., 2000, Lazarus et al., 2003). Homing of IgA producing B cells to diverse mucosal tissues appears to be mediated by CCR10 and the ligand CCL28 (Lazarus et al., 2003). In contrast, skin-derived DCs imprint expression of P- and E-selectin ligands and CCR10 on activated lymphocytes (Campbell and Butcher, 2002, Campbell et al., 2003, Schon et al., 1999). Lung DCs imprint the expression of CCR4 on lymphocytes which promote homing to the lung (Mikhak et al., 2013). Thus, the majority of activated lymphocytes home back to the site of antigen uptake by the DC.",

Adoptive transfer experiments in animals has shown that cells obtained from mucosal tissues that have been donated to syngeneic animals preferentially repopulate the recipient's mucosal tissues which is compelling evidence of a common mucosal immune system (Griscelli et al., 1969, Hall et al., 1977, McDermott and Bienenstock, 1979, Weisz-Carrington et al., 1979). This activation by antigen at a mucosal inductive site which leads to effector and/or memory T and B cells in distal mucosal sites is referred to as functional connectiveness and is the basis for the common mucosal immune system (Kiyono and Fukuyama, 2004, Kunisawa et al., 2008, McGhee et al., 1992) (Table 1\n).",

Several physical barriers prevent antigen/pathogen contact with gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) and penetration of the gut wall such as mucous production, peristaltic movement of the gut, secretion of natural antibacterial substances such as lysozyme and host defense peptides which protect the intestinal surface against bacterial penetration, and the extreme pH environment of the stomach and the protease rich environment of the small intestine which compromise the immunogenicity of ingested antigens (Medina and Guzm\u00e1n, 2000, Pasetti et al., 2011). Also, antibodies or other components in maternal colostrum/milk may interfere with antigen uptake and/or function (Brandtzaeg, 2003, Snoeck et al., 2003). Therefore, if one could design a vaccine to activate the common mucosal immune system, it would be a tremendous advantage to initiate mucosal immunity to oral antigens at respiratory or genital mucosa where the activated lymphocytes would then migrate to the oral mucosa to protect the gastrointestinal tract.",

In a disease such as Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), which is economically devastating to a pig barn should an outbreak occur, live-attenuated vaccines are not administered to seronegative herds. Even though it is unlikely that the attenuated virus will revert to virulence, it is considered too great a risk to vaccinate proactively and therefore PRRSV vaccines are administered to pigs in barns that have had an outbreak, and thus these vaccines are not proactively administered (Botner et al., 1997, Hu and Zhang, 2014, Storgaard et al., 1999). One may speculate that the reason why attenuated pathogens are so effective as mucosal vaccines may be that in order to trigger an oral immune response instead of tolerance, the pathogen must traverse the gut wall and/or penetrate the epithelial cells lining the gut wall. However, some researchers have shown that subunit vaccines formulated with adjuvants such as cholera toxin (CT) can trigger mucosal immunity in pigs, and some of these works are described within (Foss and Murtaugh, 1999, Foss and Murtaugh, 2000, Hyland et al., 2004, Verdonck et al., 2005a, Verdonck et al., 2005b).",

            "text": "For this review, we present manuscripts with evidence that vaccinations and/or inoculation of pigs at one mucosal site triggers a measurable immune response within the local mucosa, within the blood and within at least one distal mucosal immune site. For example, research wherein pigs have been exposed to replicating but attenuated virus via the intranasal route and which showed virus-specific IgG or IgA antibody production or cell-mediated immune responses within the respiratory mucosa (i.e. local mucosa), oral or vaginal mucosa (distal mucosa) as well as in the blood (systemic immune response) would meet our criteria for reporting. If only a local mucosal immune site and/or serosal response is reported (i.e. intranasal vaccination of piglets reporting antibody production in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and/or blood only), the report will not be included in this review. As such, we intend this review to be a thorough examination of the literature that reports evidence for induction of the common mucosal immune response in pigs. We are aware, however, that our approach has several limitations which we will now outline. First, intranasal immunizations may indeed also be peroral if a portion of the vaccine is swallowed. If this is the case, we cannot interpret evidence of antibodies in the gut as truly an induction of a distal mucosal site because the GALT was directly stimulated and therefore should be considered local mucosa. Unfortunately, it is impossible to discern whether sufficient precautions were taken to ensure an exclusively intranasal immunization in these reports and we can only trust what was reported (i.e. that the route was intranasal). But for this reason, we are more confident that the common mucosal immune system was induced if any reports of intranasal immunization also report immunity at a distal site other than the oral mucosal immune system. Second, our approach will be to evaluate protection or immune response through induction of antigen-specific IgG or IgA titers, the presence of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and/or induction of antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (such as induction of IFN\u03b3 expression or lymphocyte proliferation), if reported. Unfortunately, the majority of the manuscripts examined here only report antibody production without correlation with the presence of ASCs in that organ. We are thus aware that there is the possibility that IgA and IgG antibodies may be in the blood and transported to the distal mucosal site via receptors such as pIgR or FcRn, respectively (Kaetzel et al., 1991, Raghavan et al., 1993, Stirling et al., 2005). Thirdly, if the antigen is delivered as part of a replicating bacteria, yeast, or virus, the possibility exists that the pathogen/vector can disseminate (unless the pathogen has a strict tissue-tropism) and/or the antigen is presented to distal mucosal sites through the migration of activated DCs. A careful examination of the types of DCs that may take up the antigen from the local mucosa including their adhesion molecules (i.e. whether they are specific for the nasal-broncho-respiratory tract, digestive tract, etc.) could shed light on antigen migration. Thus, the review will be divided into sections discussing manuscripts which show direct evidence of induction of the common mucosal immune system (i.e. ASC in distal sites and/or induction of cell-mediated immunity) first then followed by manuscripts which only show indirect evidence (i.e. antibody titers). Within these categories, we will discuss non-replicating and replicating vaccines. Finally, please note that we will not include a discussion on the mammary-entero link nor the influence of mammary secretions on gut immune system; for a review on these subjects we suggest the following excellent publications (Bourges et al., 2007, Bourges et al., 2008, Levast et al., 2014, Salmon, 2000, Salmon et al., 2009).",

The pigs were inoculated intranasally at days 0, 21, and 42 and then orally challenged with 103 oocysts (VEG strain) at day 49. Immediately prior to challenge, two pigs immunized with the rhoptry proteins were euthanized and PBMCs and mLNs were harvested. mLNs and PBMCs were stimulated with rhoptry proteins ex vivo and mLN lymphocytes showed higher proliferation (a measure of cell-mediated immunity) relative to PBMCs but because only two pigs were euthanized, statistical analysis could not be performed. The remaining animals were euthanized at day 94 which was several weeks after challenge. From the vaccinated group, three out of the remaining four pigs had marginal IgG and IgA-rhoptry specific antibody titers in blood and they showed a partial protection from tissue cyst burden. They conclude that intranasal immunization with crude rhoptry proteins of T. gondii using Quil-A adjuvant in pigs was able to stimulate the common mucosal immune response and partially protect animals from brain cyst formation after oral exposure to T. gondii oocytes (da Cunha et al., 2012).",

Pigs were inoculated oral-nasally with TGEV or with PRCV at 11 days of age and then piglets were challenged with TGEV by the oral route on day 35 (24 days ppi) (Vancott et al., 1994). Piglets that were oro-nasally exposed to TGEV developed diarrhea and shed virus from rectum with lesser shedding in the nasal passages (Brim et al., 1995, Vancott et al., 1994). These pigs were protected against clinical signs of disease after challenge. In contrast piglets immunized with PRCV showed no clinical signs of disease after primary immunization and they shed virus in nasal secretions only suggesting that PRCV replicated in the respiratory tract and not the gastrointestinal tract (Vancott et al., 1994). PRCV vaccinated animals were only partially protected from TGEV challenge.",

Proliferative responses in mLN cells from PRCV-inoculated pigs were lower than those in mLN cells from both primary and secondary TGEV-exposed pigs. Despite the fact that the number of CD4+ T cells in the BLNs did not appear to increase in the groups of pigs primed with TGEV and PRCV, the magnitude of TGEV and PRCV-specific proliferation was highest in BLN cells in these groups immediately prior to challenge. In the BLN of PRCV-inoculated pigs, the proliferative responses generally remained high after TGEV challenge which correlated with protection against nasal virus shedding. In contrast, BLN cells from TGEV-reinoculated pigs showed a significant but transient decrease in proliferation that returned to a high level at harvest and these pigs were protected against virus shedding in nasal secretions after challenge. PRCV and TGEV-inoculated pigs as well as TGEV-challenged pigs did not show significant lymphocyte proliferation in response to PRCV or TGEVin any of the lamina propria cells purified from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.",

Higher IgA to IgG ASC ratios were detected in the duodenum and jejunum prior to challenge (Vancott et al., 1994). Measurement of ASCs showed that the BLN and spleen had elevated IgA and IgG ASCs after challenge and the presence of IgA ASCs in the gut lamina propria of TGEV-primed pigs at the time of challenge correlated with complete protection against TGEV challenge (Vancott et al., 1994). The immune response generated in piglets primed through the oro-nasal route with PRCV was quite different from the response generated by piglets primed with TGEV. PRCV-exposed pigs had mainly IgG ASCs in BLNs with a limited number in the ileum. The duodenum and jejunum showed a very small number of IgA ASCs whereas other sites had virtually no IgA ASCs. After challenge with TGEV, five of twelve PRCV-primed pigs developed diarrhea and showed an increase in IgA ASCs in BLN, spleen, duodenum and jejunum. Very few IgA ASCs were detected in the ileum and none were detected in the mLN. More importantly, the number of IgG ASCs increased rapidly in the gut lamina propria and mLNs but not the BLN (which already had fairly high IgG ASCs). These data may indicate that PRCV-specific IgG ASC precursors in BALT of PRCV-primed pigs migrated to the gut in response to TGEV challenge, contributing to partial protection. Thus, unlike what has been shown in rabbits and rodents where GALT-derived IgA B cells are the major migratory cells among mucosal lymphoid tissues and which are thought to migrate more readily to BALT than the GALT (McGhee et al., 1992, Sminia et al., 1989), data from Vancott et al. (1994) indicate that virus-specific IgG ASC and memory B cells that rapidly accumulated in the gut lamina propria and mLN of PRCV-primed pigs after TGEV challenge most likely migrated from the BALT (Vancott et al., 1994).",

A \u2018lavage\u2019 control group (n\n = 5) were lavaged at week one, five and six (without being immunized) (Delventhal et al., 1992, Pabst et al., 1995). Another \u2018non-immunization\u2019 control group was lavaged then infected by aerosol challenge and lavaged again one week later. The experimental pigs were lavaged followed by orally immunized with 1011 active or inactive (irradiated) bacteria (Delventhal et al., 1992, Pabst et al., 1995). All groups (with the exception of the lavage control group) were infected by aerosol challenge with 108 viable APP at week five then lavaged one week later. The experimental groups were lavaged at weeks seven and eight as well. Results showed that the nonimmunized pigs were severely ill after infection with APP and showed massive pathology at necropsy within one week after the infection whereas the animals immunized with viable or inactivated appeared clinically normal. The lavage control group showed no significant differences in the numbers of cells in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid, the differentials, or lymphocyte subsets. Relative to the animals orally immunized with inactivated bacteria, the pigs immunized with viable bacteria showed a trend toward higher numbers of nucleated cells and an increased proportion of granulocytes, a comparable 40% composition of macrophages, and a constant proportion of about 2\u20135% lymphoid blasts and plasma cells were found. In the BAL of normal pigs, plasma cells and blasts are rare but the percentage of plasma cells in BAL increased significantly after oral immunization with either viable or non-viable bacteria (Delventhal et al., 1992, Pabst et al., 1995). Immunization with either viable or no-viable bacteria triggered an overall increase in the total number of T cells but the ratio of CD4/CD8 cells remained constant. There was a significant increase in IgA+ ASCs in BALs after immunization with inactivated bacteria but there was a significant increase in IgG+ and IgM+ ASCs in pigs orally immunized with viable or nonviable bacteria. Thus, oral administration of either viable or inactivated A. pleuropneumoniae induced an influx of lymphocytes into the bronchoalveolar compartment of pigs, indicating a migration from the gut or lamina propria of the bronchi and trachea into the airways (Delventhal et al., 1992, Pabst et al., 1995).",

Remarkably, intranasal inoculation of pigs with bsVLPx2+ induced higher numbers of intestinal IgA and IgG ASC and memory B-cell responses than did three oral doses of live attenuated Wa HRV (Yuan et al., 1998, Yuan et al., 2000, Yuan and Saif, 2002). Despite these responses, pigs immunized with bsVLP2x+ were not protected against diarrhea nor did they produce significantly enhanced virus-neutralizing antibody titers compared to the challenged control pigs. Clearly, intranasal immunization of gnotobiotic piglets triggered mucosal immunity when mLT adjuvant was included in the vaccine, but not protection.",

The ASC responses induced by the bsVLPx3+ regimen (i.e. with the bovine/simian VLPs) showed similar patterns in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues with no significant differences in magnitude compared to pigs i.n. inoculated twice with bsVLP+. Pigs i.n. immunized with bhVLPx3+ (i.e. with the bovine/human VLPs) induced 4- to 7-fold-higher mean numbers of IgG ASC but 6- to 16-fold-lower mean numbers of IgA ASC in the duodenum and ileum compared to bsVLPx3+ pre-challenge suggesting that the strain from which the antigen was derived (human or simian) impacts immunity. After challenge, the mean numbers of IgA and IgG ASC in the pigs i.n. immunized with bsVLPx3+ increased significantly compared to pre-challenge ASC numbers in most tissues, except IgG in the duodenum and IgG and IgA in bone marrow. In contrast, the mean numbers of IgA ASC in the bhVLPx3+ pigs increased significantly in the duodenum and ileum and the IgG ASC increased significantly in the mLN, spleen, peripheral blood, and bone marrow post-challenge suggesting that the source of antigens (human or simian rotavirus) impacts the immune response (Yuan et al., 2000). Again, despite these data showing immunogenicity of the vaccine antigens and induction of memory B cell in the ileum, pigs i.n. immunized with bsVLPx3+ or bhVLPx3+ failed to protect gnotobiotic pigs against rotavirus challenge nor were there significant differences in percentage and mean duration of virus shedding and diarrhea, mean days to onset of shedding, mean peak titer of virus shed, and mean cumulative diarrhea scores. The authors speculate that other studies with different doses, timing of vaccination and/or viral antigens may confer protection (Yuan et al., 2000).",

These results suggest that oral priming with live attenuated Wa HRV followed by intranasal boosting with bhVLPs plus mLT was very effective in stimulating intestinal IgA ASC responses (Yuan et al., 2001). Further, pigs primed orally then boosted i.n. showed significantly higher virus-neutralizing geometric mean titers in the serum than all other groups (Yuan et al., 2001). They summarize that priming of the mucosal inductive site at the portal of natural infection with a replicating vaccine, followed by boosting with a non-replicating vaccine at a second mucosal inductive site stimulated the strongest B-cell responses in the intestinal mucosal immune system at challenge and conferred a moderately high protection rate against rotavirus disease (Yuan et al., 2001).",

Therefore, our laboratory investigated whether a subunit vaccine administered into the stomach cavity within 6 h of birth would allow an antigen to traverse the gut wall and induce oral immunity (and subvert induction of oral tolerance). Without negating stomach acid, piglets were gavaged with a two-part vaccine consisting of soluble OVA (0.5 mg or 0.05 mg) with 50 \u03bcg soluble CpG 2395 as well as a polyphosphazene microparticle (MP) encapsulating 0.5 mg OVA + 50 \u03bcg CpG 2395 (Pasternak et al. (in press)). Piglets were gavaged at less than 6 h of age with the idea that both the soluble OVA/CpG and the OVA/CpG within the MP would cross the gut wall. Polyphosphazene MPs are water-soluble and will dissolve over time to release the OVA/CpG thus acting like a prime-boost vaccine (Garlapati et al., 2010, Mutwiri et al., 2007, Mutwiri et al., 2005). With the exception of the saline control group, all piglets were i.p.-injected with 10 mg OVA plus Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) at 28 days of age and all piglets were euthanized at 49 days of age. The i.p. control group received a saline gavage but was boosted with the i.p. vaccination and therefore act as our primary systemic vaccine control group. Saline control piglets were gavaged and immunized with saline. In serum, we observed significantly higher anti-OVA IgG1 for the group gavaged with 0.05 mg OVA/CpG + MP relative to the saline control group over time and both oral vaccine groups showed higher mean titers over time relative to the i.p. control group for anti-OVA IgM, IgA, IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 although the results were not statistically significant. BALF were collected at time of death and results showed that piglets gavaged with the lowest dose of OVA/CpG + MP showed anti-OVA IgG and IgG1 titers that were statistically higher than the control group, but very low titers of anti-OVA IgA were detected in all groups (Pasternak et al. (in press)). Collectively, these results suggest that oral exposure to OVA triggers low level mucosal immunity at a distal site and they show agreement with similar trials performed in neonatal rat pups and lambs in that a significant local immune response is generated (Buchanan et al., 2013, Buchanan et al., 2012). Further studies must be undertaken to clarify the precise dose and duration of exposure required for induction of mucosal immunity as pigs grown into adulthood.",

CT-B-specific secretory IgA were detected in the intestinal mucosa from all groups but anti-IgA specific for N or myc were only detected in the intestinal mucosa of a minority of animals when fused with CT-B. When the peptides were simply mixed with CT-B, antibodies within the intestinal mucosa were not detected suggesting that linking peptides to CT-B was necessary to generate peptide-specific IgA at local mucosa. Serum antibodies were produced against the CT-B subunit in all pigs as well as weak titers of anti-CT-B antibodies in saliva and vaginal secretions, both of which are distal mucosal sites (i.e. the gavage bypassed the oral cavity and therefore saliva is not considered a local mucosal site). When N protein or myc were fused with CT-B, anti-N and anti-myc IgA antibodies were detected in the serum but not in the saliva or vaginal secretions. IgG anti-Myc was detected in the serum even without conjugation with CT-B, but not at the mucosal sites. Thus oral vaccination with CT-B was able to elicit distal IgA antibody responses in the saliva and reproductive tract, though the magnitude of the response was small relative to local mucosal antibody production and the response did not extend to the unlinked peptides.

Five days after the final vaccine was administered, cells and mucosal secretions were collected. The vaccines consisted of CT (1\u2013100 \u03bcg per animal) and recombinant CT-B (1 mg per animal) which did not result in diarrhea or any other clinical signs of toxicity. Oral CT-B alone induced statistically significant induction of anti-CT-B IgG and IgA titers in serum and jejunal mucosa but not in saliva (distal mucosa). When 100 \u03bcg CT was added to the vaccine, a robust induction of anti-CT-B IgA and IgG titers were induced in the serum, whereas an examination of the jejunal mucus showed induction of IgA titers and saliva showed induction of IgG titers. The salivary anti-CT-B IgA response also increased modestly. When the jejunal lamina propria was investigated for ASCs, it was found that it contained significantly more IgA-secreting cells than IgG or IgM secreting cells as well as significantly more IgA secreting cells than what was found in the blood and the spleen. The spleen contained more IgM ASCs than lamina propria or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and less IgA and IgG ASCs than the other two tissues. The large number of IgA secreting cells in lamina propria suggested that anti-CT-B specific antibodies in jejunal mucus were produced in the local tissues.",

A further nine pigs were orally inoculated with E. rhusiopathiae Koganei 65\u20130.15 (1.0 \u00d7 1012 CFU/group/day) as vector controls. Thirteen days after the final vaccination, pigs were each challenged intranasally with a suspension of 2.0 \u00d7 108 CCU of M. hyponeumoniae on three consecutive days. Twenty-three days after the challenge exposure, the pigs were euthanized and necropsied. The concentration of P97-specific IgG antibodies in BAL fluid obtained at the time of necropsy was significantly higher in the vaccinated group than the control group. These data show agreement with previous studies showing that vaccinated pigs have a greater concentration of M. hyponeumoniae-specific IgG than IgA titers in the BALF (Thacker et al., 2000). Thus, oral vaccination with a replicating pathogen protected pigs from bacteria administered intranasally and promoted induction of antigen-specific humoral immunity in BALF. The authors further showed that gnotobiotic piglets orally inoculated with E. rhusiopathiae KO-P97/53S showed evidence of bacteria dissemination to the lung and tracheobronchial lymph nodes after eight days. However, the authors also show that E. rhusiopathiae Koganei 65\u20130.15 strain orally administer to SPF pigs were disseminated to the tonsils (unfortunately they did not specify whether which part of the tonsil they were examining (the pharyngeal, the palantine, etc.)) but not the mesenteric lymph nodes or the lung (the only other organs investigated) after 15 days. These data support the possibility that within these vaccine trials, the bacteria did not disseminate and growth beyond the digestive cavity (Ogawa et al., 2009). Thus antibody titers in BALF are not likely present due to migration the bacteria from the oral cavity to the lungs at the time of infection.",

Further, inclusion of CpG ODN in the vaccine triggered higher overall virus-specific IgG2 to IgG1 titers whereas piglets immunized with PRRSV alone or with GpC ODN (a backbone control ODN) showed higher levels of PRRSV-specific IgG1 than IgG2 on day 35 post-immunization. Thus, the presence of CpG ODN influenced the antigen-specific IgG isotypes of produced. When PRRSV was administered alone or with GpC ODN, there was only weak anti-PRRSV IgA detected in the nasal secretions at day 21 and weak IgA in nasal secretions and oral secretions at day 35. No anti-PRRSV IgA was detected in the secretions from the saline control group for any time point. Saliva, feces and nasal secretions evaluated at day 21 and day 35 days ppi showed significant anti-PRRSV IgA in all three secretions when CpG ODN was included in the vaccine; the highest titers were observed with the highest concentration of CpG ODN.

            "text": "The porcine systemic and mucosal immune responses are similar to their counterparts in humans, and immunological tools are available to assess both innate and acquired immunity relevant for vaccine studies. Indeed, a study by Dawson reported that the porcine immune system resembles that of humans for >80% of analyzed parameters, whereas mice were similar in <10% (Dawson, 2011). Pigs are important models for studying respiratory diseases, lung inflammation and cystic fibrosis (Ekser et al., 2012, Elahi et al., 2005, Meurens et al., 2012, Rogers et al., 2008) because the pig and human lung share many physiological features (Swindle et al., 1988) including extensive inter- and intra-lobular connective tissues (Gil et al., 2010). Due to differences in animal size, development and anatomical differences, rodents may not share similar route or dose of infection, disease transmission or periods of latency and therefore they may not be appropriate to predict vaccine efficacy in humans. However, the anatomy and timing of mucosal-associated lymphoid development can be conserved or divergent at distinct mucosal sites across species. For instance, the T-independent response of mouse peritoneal B1 cells has not been confirmed in other species (Bos et al., 1996, Reynolds and Morris, 1983). In rodents there is evidence of gut PP organogenesis development in utero (Adachi et al., 1997) and yet rodents are born with a minimal GALT and they lack circulating B and T cells (Friedberg and Weissman, 1974). In contrast and as detailed in (Levast et al., 2014), piglets are born with a relatively advanced GALT structure complete with Peyer's patches (PP) that undergo further expansion and maturation upon exposure to commensal flora and environmental antigens (Barman et al., 1997, Pabst and Rothk\u00f6tter, 1999). Thus, conventionally raised piglets may have a gut mucosa that is sufficiently mature to respond to oral vaccines in the period immediately after birth, at least with humoral immunity. Even when comparing the mucosal immune system across large animal species, there are differences in anatomy and function in the mucosal tissues. Ruminants have ileal Peyer's patches that, like the avian bursa, are a primary lymphoid organ necessary for B cell development (Reynolds and Morris, 1983). In contrast, despite sharing similarities such as developing in utero and being comprised of a nearly continuous PP at birth, there is provide compelling evidence that in pigs, IPP are not a primary lymphoid organ but are instead a specialized secondary lymphoid tissue (Butler et al., 2011, Sinkora et al., 2011). In mice and humans, PP are considered important secondary lymphoid organs with B cell lymphogenesis occuring instead in fetal liver and then persisting in the bone marrow (BM) but (Cornes, 1965, Jung et al., 2010). Therefore, it is important not to assume that the common mucosal immune system exists in pigs based on evidence derived from laboratory animals and we instead should look for experimental evidence. Herein we provide some evidence for induction of the common mucosal immune system from local mucosa (i.e. oral or intranasal) to distal mucosa (saliva, genital tract, bronchus and gut, as appropriate) but as of yet we have not found evidence for linking other mucosal sites such as the conjunctiva, etc. Further studies must be undertaken to clarify the impact of mucosal immunization to all other mucosal sites. Once done, we then must define the precise dose and duration of exposure required for induction of mucosal immunity at local as well as distal sites. This knowledge will contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which this vaccination strategy promotes immunity and it will have important implications for protecting against infectious diseases in the pigs.",

            "text": "Beyond being an excellent animal model for human immunology, pigs are part of a global food production industry and therefore their health positively impacts Global One Health. For an immunization regimen to be adopted, several factors such as whether the costs and toxicity are low, whether efficacy is high and whether the vaccine is easy to administer must be considered. While controlling costs are always a consideration for livestock operations, it is equally important to consider how effective the vaccine is, especially as pigs are an outbred population. Immunization may not trigger optimal immunity in all of the animals but if enough show a positive response, herd immunity may protect the rest. Further, ease of immunization has a tremendous impact on whether an immunization regimen will be adopted. For instance oral and intranasal immunization are a labor-intensive operation and intravaginal immunization will only protect the females of a litter. Piglets grow very quickly and subsequent booster vaccine will necessitate that the piglets be snared and then physically or chemically immobilized prior to vaccination, regardless of whether the secondary vaccination takes place via the oral, intranasal or intravaginal routes. Importantly, in the process of breeding, gilts and sows undergo a lordosis response which naturally immobilizes the animals. At this time, oral, intranasal or intravaginal immunization could easily be performed without snaring and without the potential harm to the barn personnel. Again, this will only protect the females of the herd and to a lesser extent protect their offspring through passive immunization in colostrum and milk. All of these considerations must be weighed and found labor and cost-effective before mucosal immunization of pigs will be adopted.",
