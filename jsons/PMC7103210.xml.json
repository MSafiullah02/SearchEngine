Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens, especially in young chicks [3], [5]. The disease was first described in 1931, and has since remained a major problem in the poultry industry worldwide [3], [13]. Vaccines are available, but they are not effective long-term in controlling IBV infection, especially for variant strains. Genetic variations are common in new strains because of both point mutations and recombinants [14], [15], [40], [41]. The many years of experience dealing with IBV should provide a valuable model for understanding SARS CoV infection in humans.",

Adoptive transfer of T cells collected at 10 days post-infection (p.i.) protected syngenic chicks from clinical illness [30]. IBV specific memory T cells can be generated at 3 weeks p.i., and adoptive transfer of the memory T cells passed protection to the recipient chicks [22]. Innate immunity may also be instrumental in controlling IBV infection. Chicken interferon type I (ChIFN-I) inhibits IBV replication in vitro and in vivo [23]. Local administration of ChIFN-I inhibited IBV associated respiratory illness [23]. The importance of humoral immunity was indicated by Cook et al. (1991), who demonstrated that after IBV infection, bursectomised chicks suffered more severe and longer illness than intact chicks. The viral titers in tissues were also higher and lasted longer in bursectomised chicks than in normal chicks [7].",

One hundred microliters of the cell suspensions were added to IBV antigen coated plates, and the ASC were detected using an antibody ELISPOT assay (Fig. 2\n). Low numbers of specific ASC were identified in spleens and PBMC by 3 and 7 days p.i., respectively (Fig. 3\n), 3\u20137 days earlier than specific IgG was detected in sera (Fig. 1). The ASC frequencies were maximum (592.5\u00b1364.2 ASC/106 cells) in spleens at 7 days p.i., then sharply decreased more than 20-fold to 25\u00b19.9 ASC/106 cells by 14 days p.i. This level of ASC was maintained in spleens until week 10 p.i., the last week examined (Fig. 3). The numbers of ASC in PBMC followed the same kinetics as in the spleens, but at much lower frequencies, reaching a maximum at 10 days p.i. with only 69\u00b14.2 detectable ASC/106 PBMC. The levels of IBV specific IgG producing cells declined to 15\u00b17.1 ASC/106 cells at 14 days p.i. and continued to gradually decrease to 0.5 ASC/106 cells at 10 weeks p.i. (Fig. 3).",

However, the precise role of antibody in the control of IBV infection remains controversial. Some reports have shown that circulating antibody titer did not correlate with protection from IBV infection [11], [12], [24]. However, other studies demonstrated that humoral immunity plays an important role in disease recovery and virus clearance [7], [37], [38]. In our own studies, although the transfer of MHC compatible immune T cells eliminated initial illness and viral replication, mild illness was observed following the acute stage of infection [22], [30]. Therefore, total recovery involves other mechanisms in addition to T cells. The current study revealed that the ASC frequency in spleens and peripheral blood reached maximum levels between 7 and 10 days p.i., correlating with the maximum virus load in the lungs [29], suggesting that ASC are available early in chicks after IBV infection, although their role in antibody production at this time is not know.",

Memory B cells in peripheral blood and spleens could be detected by 3 weeks, and as late as 10 weeks, p.i. This is also the first report of direct detection of avian memory B cells, and the evaluation of the frequencies of avian antibody secreting B cells in peripheral blood. Wu et al. detected ASC in chicken spleens after infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection using ELISPOT assay [42]. Although they did not determine the dynamics of the generation of ASC after virus infection, the IgG ASC frequency at 14 days p.i. (22.67\u00b16.11 ASC/106 splenocytes) was similar to our results (25\u00b19.9 ASC/106 splenocytes).",

Similar to the T cell responses described in chickens [22], [29], three distinct stages can be observed in the chicken B cell response: expansion, decreases in numbers, and memory (Fig. 3). At the first stage, the IBV specific ASC expanded dramatically and reached a maximum between 7 and 10 days p.i. During this time, IBV in vivo infection increases to its maximum titer [6]. After 10 days infection, the virus was cleared by the host immune system. As in T cell responses, following antigen depletion, the IBV specific ASC response entered the second stage when the numbers decreased precipitously, perhaps as a result of apoptosis. In the third stage, a low level of residual memory B cells were generated and could be detected at 3 weeks p.i., similar to the maintenance of memory T cells [22].",

In this study, we also detected a low level (\u223c20 ASC/106) of plasma cells in chicken spleens up to at least 18 weeks p.i.

Interestingly, the ASC frequency reached a maximum at 7\u201310 days p.i., while the antibody in the sera was barely detectable at 7 days p.i. and became unquestionably positive only by 10 days p.i. or beyond. When the ASC frequencies were decreasing between 10 and 14 days, the serum antibody was increasing. Therefore, serum antibody did not correlate with clinical illness or viral titers. However, the ASC frequency in this study and effector T cells shown in previous studies did correlate [6]. Although the lower levels of antibody, detected in the sera at 7\u201310 days p.i., could be saturated by the presence of maximum levels of virus in vivo, plasma B cells may not have matured until later. The decrease in primary ASC may be a consequence of the decreasing levels of antigen stimulation as the virus is eliminated from the host by cellular mechanisms. It is possible that continued presence of initial B, as well as T, cell numbers depends on the presence of antigen or that activated B cells have migrated elsewhere. While B cell function certainly depends on the levels of secreted specific antibody. Local specific IgA and IgM in the early infection might also be involved in controlling IBV infection, and their role should be addressed in the future [25], [29], [37], [39]. Furthermore, the levels of neutralizing antibody were not examined.",

Serological testing for specific antibody, including indirect immunofluorescence assays and ELISA, has been developed [4].
