COVID-19 presents with a variety of phenotypes range from asymptomatic to severe, rapid multiorgan dysfunction and death. The mechanisms are multifactorial but may include a hypercoagulable state with micro- and macro-circulatory thrombosis. The virus can bind to endothelial cells, damage the vessels and lead to platelet aggregation. The coagulation function is deranged [3]. Clots in the small vessels of all organs were described [4]. In this study we report an unusual presentation of COVID-19 with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).",

COVID-19 wildly reported to cause cytokine storm syndromes, which may cause acute cerebral disease. According to Mao et al., 36.4% of COVID-19 infected cases showed neurological manifestations. Acute cerebrovascular disease was reported in 5.7%. To our knowledge our patient is the first case of CVT associated with COVID-19.Our patient was a healthy male without any CVT susceptible conditions. He did not have common COVID-19 infection's symptoms. Considering lymphopenia and low oxygen saturation, evaluation of COVID-19 was done. Mao et al found that the lymphocyte count were lower for patients with CNS symptoms as described in our patient, this finding may be indicate of the immunosuppression in this group [2]. Elevated CPK and LDH was reported due to muscle injury in COVID-19, [2], but we do not know elevated CPK in our patient is resulting the seizure or muscle involvement. Our case highlights the importance of identifying CVT as a presenting sign of COVID-19.",
