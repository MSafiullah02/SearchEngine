In the past 10 years, there has been an increase in the number of ferrets available in pet stores within the United States. Most pet stores obtain their ferret stock from one commercial breeder, although there are other commercial breeders and small, individual breeders who supply the retail market. Most of the diseases presented in this article are being diagnosed in ferrets from different sources, although in the pet trade different shipments may be mixed.",

There is also nodular enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Clinically, some practitioners have reported an effusion in the body cavity of their patients that resembles the \u201cwet form\u201d of FIP, but this has not been a common condition associated with this disease in ferrets. Designating \u201cwet\u201d or \u201cdry\u201d forms is somewhat arbitrary, because many cats exhibit lesions consistent with both forms during the course of the illness; it is likely that this is also occurring in ferrets.

Further genomic sequencing of the virus is required to establish a definitive classification of this virus. In conclusion, the relatively recent recognition of FSCV in pet ferrets suggests a recent mutation or shift in the FECV, which has resulted in the development of a systemic disease. This apparent viral mutation is apparently similar to the changes that occurred in feline coronavirus preceding the development of FIP.1, 2, 3\n",

This vaccine is no longer available; therefore, it is unknown if this syndrome will continue. However, the author has seen at least one confirmed DIM case (2009) in which the ferret did not receive the aforementioned vaccine; consequently, there may be other disease triggers for DIM. In one clinical investigation using the canine castration vaccine, this myofasciitis syndrome was reproduced in the entire group of ferrets, suggesting that DIM may be an immunological response to an inflammatory stimulation.4 Cytokines in ferrets have recently been studied and found to be similar in structure and function to those of other carnivores.6 The ferret immune system, for the most part, functions in a similar manner to other animals; therefore, future DIM investigations should focus on the immune system rather than trying to identify an infectious etiology, based on similar diseases of dogs and cats.",

Case histories from ferrets diagnosed with AAMA are being reviewed, but thus far the only discernible correlation between these cases is that the affected animals are under 18 months of age. Ferrets that present with AAMA present with a history of lethargy and anorexia and, when examined, have pale to white mucus membranes (Fig 2). A few patients have been determined to have moderate splenomegaly, but other physical parameters that can be assessed through external examination appear normal. Packed cell volumes of these animals are generally less than 10%, with bone marrow aspirates being diagnosed as erythrocytic aplasia. AAMA ferrets often have normal white blood cell counts and plasma chemistry parameters. Although transfusions are provided to these patients, erythropoietin therapy is usually ineffective. High doses of corticosteroids have been attempted to rule out an immune-mediated component to this disease process, but do not appear to have a beneficial effect in reducing any of the adverse physical conditions associated with AAMA. The underlying etiology of AAMA in ferrets is currently unknown. Ultimately, compiling case information and full necropsy examinations on patients diagnosed with this disease will be necessary to aid in the pathophysiologic investigation. A few ferrets diagnosed with AAMA have survived with intensive hospital care (e.g., repeated blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and erythropoietin), so there is some potential hope with this disease.",

If possible, blood should be collected for a coagulation profile to confirm an antemortem diagnosis of a coagulopathy. Currently, AHS is thought to be a hemophilia disorder.

The affected ferrets had prolonged clotting times, but full coagulation profiles on the 3 animals listed were not available.

Larger ulcers are frequently apparent on the mucosa of the cheeks or lips (Fig 4B). Currently, veterinarians are encouraged to take a swab of the affected oral area for viral isolation or collect a biopsy sample to determine a possible etiology. For severe ulcers (Fig 4C), topical lidocaine gel 1% (Xylocain Topical; Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE USA), parenteral analgesics, antibiotics (e.g., to control opportunistic bacterial infections), and a ferret \u201ccritical care\u201d diet can be used to keep the ferret comfortable while the ulcers heal.

Many of these ferrets from this new animal source have exhibited chronic conjunctivitis, sneezing, wheezing, and coughing. Conventional diagnostic testing has not provided a definitive diagnosis for this disease condition. Diagnostic tests used to test affected ferrets included bronchiolar lavage (e.g., cytology, aerobic, anaerobic culture), radiographs, endoscopy, heartworm antigen detection, echocardiography, and nasal/tonsil swabs for bacterial/fungal isolation. In addition, a variety of treatment protocols were also tested in these animals, including antihistamines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and decongestants. However, most of the affected ferrets had no resolution of their clinical signs, despite treatments. The coughing episodes were harsh, paroxysmal, and sometimes productive.",

The 2-year-old female had severe lung pathology consisting of florid lymphoplasmacytic inflammation around the terminal airways, which was associated with luminal attenuation (Figs 5 and 6). Airway epithelial cells appeared attenuated, exfoliated, or eroded. Lumina occasionally contained accumulations of lymphocytes, neutrophils, or necrotic cellular debris. Remaining epithelial cells were denuded of cilia and showed intranuclear edema. There was some mild perivascular lymphoid cuffing. No inclusions or syncytia were observed by the pathologist. Multifocal lipid pneumonia was noted in the parenchyma beneath the capsule or adjacent to the lymphoid nodules. The pulmonary parenchyma was diffusely edematous and congested. All other tissues appeared normal. The diagnosis was severe, nonsuppurative bronchitis, with lesions most closely resembling those of chronic murine pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pulmonis in rats. Immunohistochemistry of the tissues was negative for influenza virus but positive for Mycoplasma spp.",
