In one, egg-laying began sometime in spring, when daylengths reached a stimulatory level, and continued until the corresponding daylengths in summer or autumn were reached, that is, the egg-laying season extended symmetrically on either side of the summer solstice. This is regarded as a \"primitivetype\" response and is characteristic of phylogenetic lines which are thought to have evolved in, and radiated from, the tropics; the comb duck, muscovy duck, ringed teal and southern pochard are examples. The second kind of response was characterized by the cessation of egg-laying when daylengths still remained stimulatory, that is, a characteristic photorefractoriness to long days developed, and egg-laying occurred during the first half of the year at Slimbridge. We term this a \"temperate-type\" response, and examples are provided by nearly all the sheldgeese and shelduck, by the mandarin, Carolina, white-winged wood duck and all Aythya and the sea duck. Only a few examples of apparently intermediate breeding response were noted and these transitional species are discussed, for example the Andean goose, Abyssinian blue-winged goose and Radjah shelduck.",

In Ayrhya, the onset of reproductive activity was strongly correlated with the latitude of origin whereas the end of breeding was not. This was because refractoriness developed at about the same time in all species, even though they began breeding in response to different photoperiods. For this reason, the length of breeding season expressed at Slimbridge was correlated with the midlatitude of the breeding range in the wild but even more strongly with the photoperiod under which egg-Iaying was initiated. The onset of breeding in the sheldgeese and perching duck was not related to latitude, perhaps because species have had time to modify their ranges. However, the end of breeding in perching duck was related t o latitude. Cessation of breeding corresponds to the onset of moult and the secretion of thyroid hormones.",

It is because so many biological functions are liable to compete for scarce environmental energy supplies that some kind of endogenous partitioning is necessary. This endogenous component is seen when different species are kept under standard lighting conditions. It follows that the photo-response of a species reflects its evolutionary history and so the discussion broaches zoogeographical and taxonomic topics. For example, it seems unlikely that the white-winged wood duck evolved in the tropics, and likely that the sheldgeese and shelduck radiated from a post-?It is regretted that while this paper was in press, Dr R.

For many species, records go back 20 years or more and implicate many females; however, the standard errors for mean laying date are small despite annual temperature variations (Murton & Kear, 1973u, 1976 . When the mean daylength at egg-laying is plotted against the mid-latitude of the natural breeding range for a group of closely related waterfowl (usually members of the same genus) straight line regressions sometimes emerge whose slopes and constant terms vary from genus to genus. This is true for Cygnus, Anser, Branta, Tudorna (Murton & Kear, 1973u) , Aythya (Murton & Kear, 1973b) and Anas . The principle is likely to apply to other avian taxa when appropriate data are accumulated, for example, see Mallinson & Mallet (1975) for Phasianidae. Thus far, with the exception of Anas and Dendrocygna and Cygnus , only the onset of breeding has been considered. In this paper we define the whole egg-laying cycle under controlled conditions and in the wild of the tribes : Tadornini (shelduck and sheldgeese), Cairinini (wood duck or perching duck and geese), Aythyini (scaup and pochard), Mergini (scoters, goldeneyes and mergansers), Somateriini (eiders) and Oxyurini (stifftails).",

Gwinner & Dorka, 1976) in avian reproductive periodicity which imposes more constraints on ecological adaptation and species distribution than is often assumed. This thesis in no way denies that environmental food supplies are of prime importance nor that the female may provide the final proximate timing of the cycle (cf. Jones & Ward, 1976) . The crucial issue is the extent to which birds are able to predict when breeding is likely to be possible and to order their physiological state accordingly. Breeding seasons, like cycles of moult, fat deposition, protein synthesis, are physiologically controlled by the periodic secretion of appropriate hormones, and the endocrine basis of the breeding and moult cycles of domestic strains of the mallard Anus platyrhynchos is becoming defined (Assenmacher, 1974; Haase, Sharp & Paulke, 1975) . Endocrine secretions are regulated by appropriate seasonal photoperiodic stimuli and this is well established in the mallard (Assenmacher, 1974) . In turn, photoperiodic phenomena resolve into problems of time measurement and involve the \"biological clock\" and circadian rhythm mechanisms (Pittendrigh & Minis, 1964; Lofts, Follett & Murton, 1970; Daan & Aschoff, 1975; Pittendrigh & Daan, 1976) . Interspecific differences in breeding periodicity have to be explained in these terms, while Assenmacher (1 974) suggests grounds for implicating circannual rhythms o f reproductive function. These topics will be pursued separately (Kear & Murton, in prep.) in relation to the evolution of dimorphism and to this end we shall refer again to Anus species.",

For example, Wiirdinger (1975) has shown how the rate of growth and development of various goose species, kept under identical rearing conditions, is species-specific and correlated with the latitude of origin, in the same way as are egg-laying cycles of these same geese (Murton & Kear, 1973~) . In northern species the maximum weight increase of goslings occurs early in the development period but later in those species originating from lower latitudes. The response is adapted to the duration for which vegetation suitable for grazing is generally available. The important point is that an approximately appropriate physiological response to ecological conditions is built into the species and is manifested as a photo-entrained endogenous response when the species is studied in captivity.",

However, at Slimbridge a unique and representative collection of swans, geese and ducks is kept and breeds under reasonably standard conditions so that the mode of entrainment to the same light regime or zeitgeber (this being the seasonal daylength cycle at 52\"N) can be compared between subjects.

The birds are either kept as pairs, or else, depending on the behaviour of the species, in larger enclosures containing several kinds where conspecific pair-bonds are soon formed.

Records have been kept of the date of first egg-laying of every species and, as mentioned, in some cases these embrace more than 20 seasons. It has not been feasible to keep individual records where several females of one species are present and, adding to the complexity, some species normally produce repeat clutches which, in others, is encouraged since the fist ones are removed to be incubated artificially. Thus, the history of all clutches produced is not known, and we cannot define the mean egg-laying season for any one year. However, the mean date of production of first eggs over the years for which records are available gives a good indication of the normal start to the egg-laying season and difficulties arise only in the case of species that have seldom laid in captivity. The date of laying of the last clutch can be calculated because records are kept of many hatching dates.",

The Anserinae are monomorphic with generally white, black or brown plumage, a single annual moult, and long pair bonds. In contrast, the \"higher\" ducks (tribes Cairinini, Anatini, Mergini, Somateriini, Oxyurini and Aythyini) have two body moults a year, and are often brightly coloured with iridescent plumage, may show marked dimorphism and have short pair bonds. The Tadornini (shelduck and sheldgeese) appear to be modern representatives of the evolutionary stage between anserines and ducks ; they provide examples of both sexual dimorphism and plumage variation between moults (Kear, 1970) , and are often FIG. 1. A hypothetical evolutionary tree of the waterfowl and screamers (Anseriformes), and the flamingos. At the foot of the picture is a pair of monomorphic mute swans, both of which care for their young, while above is a pair of dimorphic mallard, in which only the cryptic brown female tends the brood. Based on Johnsgard (1965-67) and after Kear (1970) . brightly coloured. The Cairinini (perching duck) are the group most closely related to the shelduck; indeed, Johnsgard (1965) makes it clear that evidence, from hybridization and the pattern of the downy young, places the perching duck between the shelduck and dabbling duck, although closely adjacent to the latter. Male sheIduck, sheldgeese and perching duck have very similar tracheae, with bullae that are usually osseous and rounded, and lack enlargements of the tracheal tube. The perching duck are today represented by a mixture of morphologically generalized and highly specialized forms which in various respects are thought to typify the \"primitive\" anatine condition. But, no one species does so exactly, and they also exhibit a puzzling mixture of characters so far as their breeding seasons, plumage dimorphsm and expression of parental care are concerned. Certain features of the photoperiodic responses shown by some members of the perching duck group give a better indication of the evolutionary pathway between Dendrocygna-like ancestors and the true duck (Anas, Aythya and \"higher\" forms) than do the responses of the Tadornini and, for this reason, the perching duck are discussed first. Figure 2 shows that the modern Cairinini are mostly tropical species with some supposedly relict distributions; it is likely that the evolutionary centre of the group was in equatorial and tropical regions, as with Dendrocygna but not with the swans and true geese (Murton & Kear, 1973a; .",

Two groups can be distinguished: the first characterized by long breeding seasons ( 1 ) and the second by relatively short breeding seasons with egg-laying terminating in mid-summer (2). All the group 1 species have breeding seasons that extend almost symmetrically on either side of the summer solstice. This group is typified by the African comb duck Sarkidiornis m. melanotos, the western race of Hartlaub's duck Cairina (Pteronetta) h. hartlaubi and the wild muscovy duck C. moschata. We have not previously considered the Ringed teal Anas leucophyrys and it is convenient to include details here since it is thought by some authorities to be a perching duck and is placed by them in the genus Callonetta (see below). There are too few breeding records at Slimbridge for the South American race of the Comb duck S . m. carunculatus to warrant much comment; the earliest egg-laying was recorded on 15 June and the latest recorded hatching was early in August. It is very likely, as explained below, that the Spur-winged goose Plectropterus g. gambensis belongs in this first group. Unfortunately, the records from Slimbridge are unsatisfactory because the species has never hatched eggs there. Finally, the Australian wood duck Chenonetta jubata should be included in this group for, since Kear & Murton (1976) first broached the likelihood that the species potentially has an extended egg-laying season in Britain, further records have accumulated to confirm this suspicion.",

The pair-bond is brief in this species also, the sexes arenearly alikein plumage though the male is considerably larger with a prominent caruncle on the upper mandible, and polygamy is suspected (Pitman, 1965) . It is evident that the breeding season must be initiated under a shorter photoperiod in equatorial Africa or South America than the 17.3 hour day noted in Fig. 3 for first breeding at Slimbridge. An apparently similar need for a long photoperiod to initiate breeding at Slimbridge has been noted for some equatorial Dendrocygna species and we previously attributed this to the inhibitory effects of a cool climate on these small, tropical forms . In fact, it appears that several species exhibit this pattern and we were wrong to dismiss it as an artifact. Rather, it seems that the phasing of the breeding rhythm, relative to the annual photoperiodic cycle, is of a form where the mid-point of the egg-laying season is almost in phase with the summer solstice, in both Africa and Slimbridge (see Fig. 16 and p. 267). In Zambia, the Comb duck begins breeding in November and peak nesting occurs soon after the longest day in January, there being little activity after March (Benson. Brooke, Dowsett & Irwin, 1971) .",

Wing moult in birds in England can occur as late as the end of October following breeding. Hartlaub's duck differs from other members of the genus Cuirinu in structure (Woolfenden, 1961) and behaviour, and Johnsgard (1965) has suggested naming it Pteronetta. Unfortunately, there is virtually no information on the breeding season in the wild-it is probably extended-and the only record seems to be of a nestling seen in September in the Sudan (Praed & Grant, 1952) .",

Delacour (1956) initially placed it in the genus CaIlonetta but later considered it an Anas, subsequently, Johnsgard (1965) believed the species to be a perching duck and he and Woolfenden (1961) replaced it in Callonetta. Recently, and on the basis of feather proteins, Brush (1976) has unequivocally promoted it to the Anatini. It shows permanent sexual dimorphism, the male being bright and the female brown. This is in contrast to nearly all Anus (where any dimorphism is seasonal and apparently mediated by endocrine factors (Kear & Murton, in prep.) ) but like Chenonetta (see below). In fact, only three Anus species show permanent sexual dimorphism and two of these have long \"primitive type\" breeding seasons at Slimbridge. There is, perhaps, a case for regarding the Ringed teal as representing a link between the Cairinini and the primitive members of Anas. The pairbond is long term and, as in Hartlaub's duck, the male stays with the brood taking a major part in the defence of his young.",

The species has the kind of breeding season at Slimbridge that is typically found in temperate birds and, in this respect, it contrasts with the other Cairina species (Fig. 3) . Again, it has been suggested that the species might not be so close to the Muscovy duck as its present taxonomic allocation would indicate (Mackenzie & Kear, 1976) . Wing moult among Slimbridge adults occurs during July following breeding. Consistent observations apply to birds held at Rotterdam, Holland, and also at Gauhati Zoo, Assam-which, at 26\"N, is close to the natural breeding range-where clutches are started between 18 March and 21 May. This suggests that the White-winged wood duck evolved at more temperate latitudes and has only secondarily invaded the tropics. In the wild in Assam, the bird lays from May, at the start of the rains, and apparently moults in September; for the tropical part of its range, Hoogerwerf (1950) recorded December breeding in southern Sumatra and February breeding in Java.",

Slimbridgerecordsrefer to the Red-backed Radjah T. r. rujitergum from Australia . The Black-backed Radjah T . r. Radjah from New Guinea and the Moluccas has never produced eggs at Slimbridge. Captivebirds of this race in Berlin laid eggs in mid-May (hatched 18 June), while at Crandon Park, Miami, clutches were laid in mid-August in 1969 and again in 1970, when local daylengths were around 13.25 hours (sunrise-sunset). In the wild in tropical Australia the Red-backed Radjah produces clutches between February and July in the Northern Territory (Frith, 1967) and from December to February in north-east Queensland (North, 1901-14) . There is little information for the Australian shelduck, though Campbell (1901) wrote that it is an early breeder laying during July, August and September and on Rottnest Island, the egg-laying period extends from the first week in June until mid September (Riggert, 1977) . The breeding season of the New Zealand shelduck in the wild is rather longer, nests with eggs having been found between 10 August and 23 December (Kear, unpubl.) , but it clearly approximates to a north-temperate pattern with a start in early spring and a cessation around mid-summer. The same holds for the Cape shelduck, with egg-laying occurring in South Africa from July to November (McLachlan & Liversidge, 1957) . Variations on the above theme are also to be seen in the Ruddy shelduck (Dementiev & Gladkov, 1952) and the Common shelduck T. tadorna, and Fig. 6 gives a good indication of their natural seasons. Thus, in the Common shelduck egg-laying begins in Mid-April in Britain but does not reach a peak until about the second week of May.",

The supposedly most primitive sheldgeese (Abyssinian goose and Andean goose) and most primitive shelduck (Orinoco goose, Egyptian goose and Radjah shelduck) are monomorphic and the juvenile plumage is similar to that of the adult but duller. All these species have noticeably longer egg-laying seasons at Slimbridge than the remaining Chloephaga or Tadorna species, but all Tadornini, except possibly the Radjah shelduck, have temperate-type breeding seasons. Two of the five Chloephaga species are markedly dimorphic, and all the Tadorna species, again excepting the Radjah shelduck, show a degree of dimorphism, but this is only really marked in the New Zealand shelduck and the recently extinct crested shelduck T. cristata, and to a lesser extent in the common shelduck. This trend to dimorphism is correlated with an increase in the mid-latitude of the natural breeding range. The breeding seasons of the Tadornini at Slimbridge give a good indication of the situation in the wild, where known, except in the case of the species possessing more extended cycles such as the Egyptian goose and Radjah shelduck. Diving duck-scaup and pochard (Aythyini) Aythya has almost certainly arisen from Netta and both genera probably derive from an Anus-like stock, perhaps via a form similar to the Marbled teal Anus (Marmaronetta) angustirostris. Netta is distinguishable from Aythya on anatomical grounds, being structurally less well equipped for diving; in turn Netta is biochemically and physiologically less well adapted to diving than is Oxyura (Cook, Siegfried & Frost, 1977) .

The distribution of these two forms could be indicative of a previously wider distribution in the southern hemisphere or reflect the dispersal powers of wildfowl, since ringing recoveries indicate the capacity of the African pochard to cover long distances (Moreau, 1966) (compare the similar distribution of the Comb duck and Fulvous whistling duck Dendrocygna bicolor). Jones (1972) reported that an African pochard laid fertile eggs throughout the year at Leckford, Hampshire, and the breeding season is clearly also extended at Slimbridge (Fig. 8) . In the wild, breeding is recorded between August and December and during May in the Cape; from February until July and August in the Transvaal (McLachlan & Liversidge, 1957) ; in May, July and November in Kenya: in December in Tanganyika; and from August to May in Nyasaland (Praed & Grant, 1952) ; for Zambia see Fig. 16 . Breeding can presumably occur throughout the year in Africa, the actual season being determined by ecological factors (see \"Discussion\"). The Rosy-bill Netta peposaca also has a long breeding season at Slimbridge but the photosensitive threshold appears to be higher than that of the southern pochard, consistent with a centre of distribution at 30\"s. In the wild at General Lavalle, Argentina (c. 37\"S), eggs and broods were found between late September and mid-November (Weller, 1968a) which compares with an egg-laying season extending from mid-April to early July at Slimbridge.",

In contrast Baer's pochard A . baeri has laid at Slimbridge between 1 June to 27 June, (median 13 June) which appears to fit records from Transbaikal in East Siberia (Dementiev & Gladkov, 1952) . Bent's (1925) dates for 25 Ring-necked duck A . collaris clutches in the wild span the period 31 May to 6 July; the Peakirk clutch completed on 3 June hatched on 1 July which is not much different from Bent's record.",

(c. 43\"N), first clutches of the Redhead A . americana were started on 2 April and the last on 15 July; peak production was during the second week of June (Holm & Bauer, 1959) . In the wild in Columbia Plateau, Washington (45-48\"N), the first hatches were noted in the first week of May and the last in the second week of August, the peak occurring during the third and fourth weeks of June (Yocom, 1950) . Captive Canvasback A . vallisneria observed at Delmar over three years produced the first egg on 18 April and the last on 27 June with the peak in the last week of May (Holm & Bauer, 1959) . With more records, the latest date of egg-laying at Slimbridge is likely to be extended to June. Weller (1959) made a detailed study of the parasitic tendencies of the Redhead, for a proportion of females lay their eggs in the nests of other ducks. He pointed out that at the Delta Marsh in southern Manitoba (c. lat. 50\"N), during the years 19524, egg-laying by the Redhead extended from mid-May to around 23 June with peak laying concentrated in the first half of June. The breeding season of the Canvasback at the same locality was from early May to mid-June, with peak activity around 10-15 May. Hence, although both species showed a similar spread in laying dates, the Canvasback population bred, on average, rather earlier than the Redhead, and a parallel situation is noted at Slimbridge (Fig. 8) . In the wild the Lesser scaup A . afinis begins courtship and nesting later than either of these two species (Weller, 1965) and the same chronology is noted at Slimbridge.",

This kind of colonization has occurred in several northern Anas species which may migrate to islands as remote as Tahiti and Polynesia during the contra-nuptial season (Voous, 1960) ; examples are seen in various derived races of Mallard Anasp. platyrhynchos, including the Hawaiian duck A . p . wyvilliana, and other examples are given in Kear & Murton (in prep.) . Adaptation to Australian conditions has necessitated a drop in the photo-sensitive threshold in the native white-eye so that it is among the first of the diving duck to begin breeding at Slimbridge. The onset of breeding by the New Zealand scaup (mid lat. 41\"s) is only a few days earlier than in the Common white-eye Aythya nyroca (mid lat. 45\"N) and there is little doubt that either species could readily adapt to conditions in the opposite hemisphere. In the wild, the Australian white-eye has a regular breeding season in October and November which Frith (1967) considered to be mainly timed by the seasonal photoperiod. In New Zealand, 14 nests with eggs of the New Zealand scaup were found between 4 November (photoperiod 14% hours) and 22 December and the last hatching recorded in the wild was on 2 February (Kear, unpubl.) .",

Obviously, differences in the length of breeding seasons must depend to a large extent on endogenous factors, otherwise the relationship should not be manifested at Slimbridge. Figure 9 (b) is instructive in this respect in demonstrating that the length of the breeding season is more closely related to photoperiodic response than it is to latitude: latitude accounts for 55% of the inter-specific variability in length of breeding season whereas the photoperiod effect accounts for 72% of the variation (see Fig. 9 ).

Throughout the diving duck tribe there is a noticeable trend towards sexual dimorphism with increase in the latitude of the breeding range, and towards a decrease in length of the egg-laying season. In all cases but one, the dimorphism is seasonal for the male has an eclipse phase during which he resembles the female; the Rosybill is exceptional in exhibiting a permanent sexual dimorphism. Although there is a negative correlation between the length of the egg-laying season of different Aythya species at Slimbridge and the latitude of origin, there is an even stronger correlation between the length of breeding season and the photoperiod under which breeding is initiated.

Feather proteins make it clear that the eiders are distinct from the mergansers and their allies, and that the sea duck are not immediately related to the Anatini but instead show more affinity with Oxyurini and Aythyini, with whom they may have had a common ancestor (Brush, 1976) .

In the wild, the old world Smew breeds later than the Hooded merganser Mergus cucullarus which replaces it ecologically in North America but which has the centre of its breeding range 7\" further south. Both these species are limited in range to the tree zone and the availability of woodpecker holes which they use for nesting. At comparable latitudes and locations in Europe, the Goosander M . merganser merganser breeds before the Smew ; the Goosander takes bigger fish than its congenor and is probably less dependent on the availability of young fish and invertebrates. The Red-breasted merganser M. serrator breeds later than either the smew or the goosander (Witherby et a/., 1939) . A similar temporal relationship is seen between the American merganser M . m. americanus (a subspecies of the Goosander) and Red-breasted merganser in North America, while the Bufflehead Bucephala albeola, another duck that depends on woodpecker holes for nesting sites, breeds early like the Goosander and at about the same as Barrow's goldeneye B. islandica. Hence, the breeding seasons depicted in Fig. 10 tend to be a true reflection of the natural seasons, except that the wild Barrow's goldeneye nests much later than the European goldeneye B. c. clangula, even though the centre of its breeding range is 10\" further south. This may depend upon the fact that Barrow's goldeneye nests at higher altitudes, especially in the southern part of the range, and is mainly non-migratory.",

The answer to this anomaly may be that, unlike other high latitude breeders, the King eider mostly remains within the arctic circle during the contra-nuptial season, where it can survive the presence of winter ice, and so the annual daylength cycle to which it is exposed is rather unlike that to which it is exposed at Slimbridge and entrainment may be different (see p. 266).

An advantage of late breeding in the related Red-breasted goose B. rujicollis is that it is able to nest at the same time as, and close to, the Peregrine falcon Falcoperegrinus on which it depends for protection from the Arctic fox .4Zopex Zagopus. The Spectacled eider Somateria jischeri also breeds on a narrow coastal strip of northeast Arctic Siberia and Alaska (replacing the European eider) but winters further south than the King eider, for example, on the southern edge of the ice in the Bering Seas.

This argues against the group coming from Aythya-like ancestors or any other group with an advanced temperate-type breeding rhythm, but it could derive from tropical Anus-like stock near to Heteronetta. At Slimbridge the earliest egg date for the North American Ruddy duck Oxyura j . jamaicensis is 17 April while last clutches have been started around 26 July. At Slimbridge, both the Ruddy duck and White-headed duck frequently produce a second clutch if the first is removed for artificial incubation; they may produce a third but, as it is not easy to tell the females apart, this is not confirmed. A captive pair in Sussex laid four clutches in one season beginning on 27 April, 7 May, 3 June while the fourth hatched on 5 August (D. Mulholland, pers. comm.).

According to Bent's (1925) records, nests with eggs have been found between 26 April and 11 August in California, the peak being from 22 May to 10 June; in North Dakota, records span the period 8 June to 19 July and from December to March in Puerto Rico. Yocom (1950) thought that first hatches occurred in the first week of June in Washington State, and the last were noted in the second week of August. In N. W. Iowa, Ruddy duck nest initiation occurs in May, peak nesting is in June and the last clutch was begun on I 1 July; in Manitoba nest initiation extends from late May to late July and from mid-May until early July in California (Bellrose, 1976) . Evidently, throughout a wide latitude range in North America, the period of nest initiation in the Ruddy duck stays around the same length at 53-63 days. In contrast, it is pointed out on page 268 that the length of the Carolina's nesting season in N. America decreased the further north it bred.",

Siegfried (1970) speculated on the selective advantages of this remarkable double wing-moult, and could find none. He noted that stifftails do not use their wings under water so that extra wear on these feathers could not be the reason for their twice yearly renewal. However, as Palmer (1976) pointed out (for the Ruddy duck at least), that same moult includes not only the body plumage but also the tail, which in other waterfowl is moulted once only, with the wings. It seems to us that the phenomenon may occur primarily in order to renew the tail which, in these aquatic duck, is long and stiff to serve in underwater control and is presumably subject to considerable feather wear. If the mechanism by which the tail retrices and the wing remiges are moulted is physiologically linked-that is, one group cannot be shed without the other-then this fact could account for the stifftails' complete double moult. The habit could not have evolved if two annual periods of flightlessness were an enormous disadvantage but, presumably, in these highly aquatic divers, any loss of flying ability is unimportant in comparison with the possibility of having an inefficient underwater \"rudder\". The moult cycle is also unusual, compared with that of the Mallard and other dabbling ducks, in that the display plumage (alternate plumage) is acquired during the spring moult and it is lost during the second moult in late summer/early autumn, that is, eclipse or basic plumage is worn throughout the winter (Palmer, 1972) . In the Mallard the display plumage is acquired at the autumn moult and this is then carried until the following early spring in the female and summer in the male so that the eclipse phase persists for only a few months during the summer.",

There is no argument about the existence of circannual rhythms and the critical question is whether these are regulated by circannual oscillators or instead are compounded from the interaction of different circadian oscillators. The topic is raised here because it is desirable, as Aschoff (1965) long ago emphasized, to measure the phase relationships of rhythms by reference to their mid-points (see also Daan & Aschoff, 1975) . For convenience we shall for the moment assume that the egglaying seasons of waterfowl at Slimbridge represent entrained circannual rhythms of gonadotrophin activity. The x-axes of Figs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 comprise 365 days which can be transformed to 360\" without appreciable loss of accuracy.

Obviously, this would be a truism if only the start of the egg-laying season were used as a reference point, for then calendar date would in effect be plotted against the movement of the sun : nevertheless, the relationship would disappear if some species did not begin breeding until after the summer solstice. The relationship would also disappear in considering the mid-point of the cycle if birds that started breeding on short daylengths compensated by remaining in breeding condition for proportionately longer than those that initially required long daylengths to respond. In fact, Fig. 13(a) illustrates that this tends to happen in those perching duck found to have \"primitive\" egg-laying patterns for, in these, there was relatively little phase shift related to the dayIength under which breeding was initiated. The slope of the regression relating phaseshift to photoperiod is much steeper for the perching duck with temperate-type rhythms and for the other taxa detailed in Fig. 14 because refractoriness to long days develops and results in a marked positive phase shift in the egg-laying rhythm relative to the zeitgeber. Refractoriness does not develop under exactly the same photoperiod within any group of closely related species but there is less variability in the range of daylengths at which breeding stops than in the range under which it begins, as can be judged from Figs 6 and 8 in particular. In consequence, there is a negative correlation between the length of the breeding season ( y ) and the photoperiod needed to initiate breeding (x) as was demonstrated in Fig. 9 .",

In these cases, similar results would be obtained by plotting the daylength under which breeding begins against the mid-latitude of the natural breeding range, as was done for Cygnus, Branta, Anser and Tadorna in Murton & Kear (1973a) and for Netta and Aythya in Murton & Kear (19733) . A correlation between the phase shift of onset of egglaying and latitude of origin is most evident in Aylhya (Fig. 14(c) ), as would be expected from the data referred to above (Murton & Kear, 1973b) . No correlation was found in the phase shift of end of egg-laying with latitude, clearly because refractoriness develops in all Aythya species under approximately the same daylength. Presumably, this is also the reason why there is little variation in the date at which breeding ends in the Carolina throughout a wide range of latitudes (see p. 252). The sea duck would probably resemble Aythya but the data are more confused because several genera are involved, with few species in each (Fig. 14(d) ). Previously, no significant relationship with daylength at egg-laying (number of days from winter solstice) and latitude of origin was found in the sheldgeese (Murton & Kear, 1973a) and likewise no correlation is found when the phase shift to onset or end is considered (Fig. 14(b) ). Perhaps this is because the range of some species is different from their centres of origin (see p. 271). In the perching duck the phase shift measured to the end of the breeding season is correlated with latitude, that is, the time of onset of moult. This is of interest because some while ago Snow & Snow (1964) suggested that a fixed timing of the moult in relation to varying environmental conditions synchronized the rest of the annual cycle, including the breeding cycle, in several Trinidad species (see also Snow, 1962) . In a more recent study of the Cotingidae, Snow (1976) has also argued a case for implicating an endogenous circannual cycle of moult, without denying the importance of food availability. We agree with this viewpoint.",

Gonadotrophin secretion (luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion are photoperiodically regulated by light sensitive circadian rhythm mechanisms. For the present we shall simply refer to this complex system in terms of the factors initiating egg-laying and the factors responsible for terminating breeding, these last usually being associated with the onset of the post-nuptial moult.",

Theoretically there need be no such relationship, and, for some taxa, none exists. The observations do make sense it if is assumed that they reflect the adaptation of a basic photo-response mechanism that was possessed by an ancestral species, which subsequently speciated by radiating to higher latitudes. The systematic changes in photoresponse result because the seasonal light cycle likewise changes in a systematic manner with latitude. lmagine some proto-Aythya living around latitude 45\"N at the end of one of the earlier glaciations. As the ice retreated, new habitats became available further north into which the species could spread. Because summer arrives later closer to the poles, an adaptive response would be for the colonists to delay their migration north and to reach breeding condition later in the season. Equipped with ancestral photo-responses they would begin moving north too quickly ; moreover, following the spring equinox, daylengths become longer with increase in latitude. Selection would evidently favour individuals possessing higher photo-sensitive thresholds and, therefore, needing longer daylengths to stimulate gonadotrophin secretion. In oscillator terminology, selection would favour a decrease in the frequency of any light sensitive oscillators so that the breeding cycle was less positively phased with regard to the light cycle. When returned to a common zeitgeber, a series of species that had evolved such adaptative responses at different latitudes would be expected to exhibit the pattern already noted in Figs 9, 13(c) and 14(c). It would be interesting to know how \"threshold\" was determined genetically. Since sub-species (Lofts & Murton, 1968) and even morphs of the same species (Murton, Westwood & Thearle, 1973) can vary in their photo-response threshold it is likely that relatively simple genetic changes have been involved, perhaps a series of alleles.",

The same light sensitive pace-makers are possibly implicated in the control of several rhythmic functions so that a change in breeding periodicity probably also alters the season of moult, migratory fat deposition, etc. Figs 8, 13(c) and 14(c) suggest that, although the factors initiating the egg-laying season (gonadotrophin secretion and steroid release) have been adjusted within Aythya to give a series of photo-response thresholds, the factors timing the onset of photo-refractoriness (thyroid feed-back) have been altered relatively little within the genus. Perhaps this implies a more complex interacting system that cannot be easily disrupted. Whatever the physiological explanation, the ecological implications are clear : the ability of species to radiate and adapt to a given latitude is limited by the physiological features of the ancestral species and the latitude to which this original species was adapted.",

An earlier start might be achieved if the Australian white-eye, having evolved an adaptive reduction in photo-response threshold at lat. 28\" (in this case S but it might have been N) could move to lat. 45\" (arrows in Fig. 14 illustrate the concept we are trying to advance here). However, it would still remain in breeding condition until too late in the year because at Slimbridge it begins breeding on a photoperiod of around 12.7 hours and becomes refractory when the daylength reaches 18.1 hours. In fact, species having rather a different photoperiodic phylogeny would probably be better candidates: for example, the Mandarin (from 47\"N) has a breeding season beginning on a 13.4 hour day and ending on 17.6 hour, while the Carolina (from 41\"N) begins breeding on a 12.0 hour day but finishes at Slimbridge on a 17-3 hour photoperiod; that is, both species are phased out of breeding condition before the Australian white-eye. Actually, evolutionary pressures probably operated in the opposite way to the example given above. That is, the breeding seasons of the Carolina and Mandarin were probably phased to begin and end too early in the year at 41\" and 47\" lat. N respectively, for them to be suitable ancestors for lines radiating to even higher latitudes (50\"N and above); the species would need to begin breeding later than could be achieved by a drop in the response threshold of Aix and, unlike Aix, to have a capacity to continue breeding around the solstice. Presumably, the two Aix species are indicators of the limitations of the photo-response mechanism of a past radiation of the perching duck in temperate latitudes, a limitation that led to their replacement by the \"higher\" dabbling duck, leaving Aix as a relict genus.",

In cases where the relationship between photo-response threshold and latitude is lost, as in the sheldgeese compared with the shelduck (Fig. 14) , it can be imagined that adaptation in breeding schedule has not required an alteration in photo-response. Differences in photo-sensitivity threshold which affect the onset of breeding seem easily achieved within a genus, but differences in the timing of the end of the breeding season are usually not very marked unless inter-generic comparisons are made. There are exceptions, but these lead us to suspect that current taxonomy does not accurately reflect phylogeny. For example, Fig. 6 shows that all the Chloephaga species have very similar photo-responses at Slimbridge with the exception of the Andean goose. This has a significantly longer laying season and in this respect it resembles the Abyssinian Blue-winged goose. In fact, the similarity of the pattern of the downy goslings of these two species already suggested a fairly close relationship (Blaauw, 1933; Johnsgard, 1965) , which raises the question of whether the Andean goose should remain in the genus Chloephaga. The need for a high photo-response threshold in the Andean goose is consistent with it being a high altitude breeder, like the Blue-winged goose.",

Indeed, it is probable that the centre of evolution of the shelduck and sheldgeese was in the southern hemisphere, and the ancient land mass that remained after the break-up of Gondwanaland (which included Antarctica, Australia and South America) seems a likely evolutionary centre. The sheldgeese evidently had a wide distribution in both Old and New Worlds and the somewhat anomalous relationship of their photoresponses to latitude of origin ( Fig. 14(b) ) might be explicable in terms of a radiation from higher to lower latitudes.",

Siegfried (1965a, 6) gave evidence that the Redbilled pintail Anas erythrorhyncha has a less than annual wing moult (see below). Even if the reproductive rhythm of these tropical duck is entrained by the low amplitude seasonal daylength cycle, it may be supposed that synchronization is weak so that individuals within a population are not closely in phase.

(See Murton & Kear, 1976 , for original records of the last, these having now been updated). Under a low amplitude tropical zeitgeber, the breeding seasons of these species slightly lag the season exhibited at Slimbridge, although the season of the Comb duck is virtually in phase with the light cycle at both localities. There is a suggestion in Fig. 15 that the Comb duck, which has a high photo-sensitive threshold at Slimbridge, has a much more synchronous breeding season in Africa than does the Spur-winged goose. Records for the White-back duck seem to be at variance with this interpretation and we must await the availability of more data to test the validity of this idea. Figure 15 demonstrates that those species having temperate-type laying cycles at Slimbridge exhibit breeding seasons which are quite differently phased under an equatorial zeitgeber than the \"primitive\" group considered above. At Slimbridge the Egyptian goose (Fig. 6) and also the African Black duck Anas sparsa and Yellowbill Anus unduluta have breeding seasons which are positively phased relative to the zeitgeber. In Zambia, peak breeding similarly occurs during the season of short days (contrast the Comb duck discussed above). Presumably the difference in phasing of the breeding season of the Egyptian goose and Comb duck/Spur-winged goose in Africa is paralleled by similar differences between the sympatric Orinoco goose and Muscovy duck in South America, but unfortunately no data are available.",

            "text": "It would be quite wrong to assume from this discussion that breeding seasons in Africa are proximately controlled by seasonal changes in the photoperiod. Figure 16 immediately shows that this cannot be the case, especially if nest records for the Yellowbill are considered. Breeding occurs at different times of year in different parts of South Africa depending on when the seasonal rain occurs: in the winter rainfall area (S. W. Cape) most breeding is between July and October with none from February to May; in summer rainfall regions occasional birds breed at any time of year but about 70% of records are for the December-March period. Yet another variation in the breeding pattern is noted in Zambia (Fig. 15 ). We suspect that the final proximate stimulus enabling egg-laying to occur is the nutrient condition of the female and that the ideas of Jones & Ward (1976) are fully relevant in this context (see also Braithwaite, 1976 , referring to Australian species). Nevertheless, for an animal to take advantage of favourable environmental food supplies, its own physiological condition must be suitably adjusted. This could be achieved slowly in response to the diet. But, obviously if the time of appearance of a protein rich source could be predicted, the bird could already be prepared to take immediate advantage of the situation, thereby breeding before its competitors.",

In males this means that full spermatogenetic development is achieved. In females the final growth of the follicle, after pairing, requires large energy reserves and if environmental resources are poor she may be unable to produce eggs. Thus, males broadly time the breeding cycle in response to photoperiodic changes whereas females provide the final timing in relation to food resources: the male response to photoperiod gives a timing to within two to three weeks, perhaps more precise, whereas the female times the cycle to within one day.",

            "text": "At lower latitudes, and in some southern hemisphere countries, photoperiodic changes are not reliable indicators of good ecological conditions. Even so, all birds are photoperiodic because entrainment to the daily light-dark cycle ensures that physiological and behavioural functions occur at appropriate times of day or night, and this is achieved via light sensitive oscillators. From these same oscillators are compounded mechanisms which control seasonal functions and they can be effectively entrained by low amplitude zeitgeber to ensure that, for example, moult and breeding schedules are discrete (flamingos do not appear to have a synchronized moult and do so before, during, and after breeding). At present we know virtually nothing about the mechanisms that order the priorities between moulting and breeding. Clearly one of the requirements is flexibility in the sense that the response mechanisms of the bird must not be switched off too easily by the onset of a light induced photorefractoriness. Hence, we observe that although tropical waterfowl respond to temperate photo-regimes, they do manifest a potential for extending breeding. For example, the southern pochard evidently can breed at any time of year in Africa while at Slimbridge it has a very extended \"primitive-type'' cycle (cf . Figs 8 and 16) , which is quite different from its European allies. On the other hand, tropical species which have evolved from temperate lines display their ancestry when exposed to a north-temperate light cycle for they now enter a typical photo-refractory phase; the Egyptian goose is a good example (c $ Figs 6 and 14) . The photo-response threshold of the Egyptian goose is sufficiently low to ensure that under a tropical zeitgeber breeding can effectively occur at any season in response to environmental conditions.",
