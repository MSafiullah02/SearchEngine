Although both viruses cause respiratory diseases and spread by contact and nose droplets, influenza has a shorter median incubation period than does severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Also, by contrast with influenza transmission, initial data for COVID-19 indicate that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0\u201319 years age group are low. Fraser and colleagues used detailed H1N1 incidence data; by May 4, 2009, 11 356 suspected and 822 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in Mexico.2, 3, 4 By contrast, Tuite and colleagues based their conclusion on three reported cases in Egypt by March 6.1 The scarcity of data available to the authors, as stated in their Correspondence, does not allow for the use of an appropriate modelling technique to estimate the burden of an epidemic.",

On March 25, a team of experts from WHO concluded a COVID-19 technical mission in Egypt. Yvan Hutin, director for communicable diseases in WHO's regional office and mission team lead, stated that \u201cafter several days of intensive meetings and field visits both inside and outside Cairo, we see that Egypt is making substantial efforts to control COVID-19 outbreak. Significant work is being done, especially in the areas of early detection, laboratory testing, isolation, contact tracing and referral of patients.\u201d Hutin referred to the existing pattern of transmission as local rather than community and agreed with local authorities on additional measures to further slowdown COVID-19 spread.5 The report listed the various steps that have been made by the Egyptian Government\u2014namely, allocating additional dedicated human and financial resources needed to contain the outbreak, expanding the number of peripheral laboratories that are able to test for SARS-CoV-2, and with support from WHO and other partners, increasing testing capacity (Egypt now has the capacity to do up to 200 000 tests).5 The report also commended Egypt's strong disease surveillance system and contact-tracing efforts as the main reasons behind the successful management of sporadic and clusters of cases before they spread.5\n",

The immune response-boosting effect of this vaccine has been postulated to potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, given that it has been shown to be effective against similar viruses. In March, a multicentre, phase 3, randomised clinical trial in Australia endorsed by WHO was fast tracked to investigate whether the BCG vaccine can protect against SARS-CoV-2.6 This trial aims to enrol 4000 health-care workers from hospitals in Australia in the next few weeks and should allow assessment of whether BCG vaccine can lessen the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.6\n",
