            "text": "Since 2012, monthly cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to cause severe respiratory disease that is fatal in~35% of diagnosed individuals. The ongoing threat to global public health and the need for novel therapeutic countermeasures have driven the development of animal models that can reproducibly replicate the pathology associated with MERS-CoV in human infections. The inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice, hamsters, and ferrets stymied initial attempts to generate small animal models. Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (hDPP4) as the receptor for MERS-CoV infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice. Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles, and limited MERS-CoV susceptibility to tissues that naturally express mDPP4, notably the lower respiratory tract wherein MERS-CoV elicits severe pulmonary pathology. Here, we describe the generation of the 288-330 +/+ MERS-CoV mouse model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by modifying two amino acids on mDPP4 (A288 and T330), and the use of adaptive evolution to generate novel MERS-CoV isolates that cause fatal respiratory disease. The 288-330 +/+ mice are currently being used to evaluate novel drug, antibody, and vaccine therapeutic countermeasures for MERS-CoV. The chapter starts with a historical perspective on the emergence of MERS-CoV and animal models evaluated for MERS-CoV pathogenesis, and then outlines the development of the 288-330 +/+ mouse model, assays for assessing a MERS-CoV pulmonary infection in a mouse model, and describes some of the challenges associated with using genetically engineered mice.",

            "text": "In February of 2018 MERS-CoV was listed as a priority on the R&D Blueprint for the global strategy and preparedness plan outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . The R&D Blueprint includes viruses that pose a global public health risk, and for which there are no available therapeutic countermeasures [1] . Twenty-seven countries have reported cases of MERS-CoV with most cases confined to the Arabian Peninsula. Diagnosed cases of MERS-CoV in countries outside the Arabian Peninsula are primarily traveler associated. The potential for global spread of MERS-CoV was realized in 2015 when a single traveler returning to South Korea initiated an outbreak that infected 186 people resulting in 20% fatality and caused widespread fear that crippled the economy for nearly 6 months [2] [3] [4] . Human-to-human transmission is often associated with close contact in the health care setting, but can also occur between family members within a household [5] . Asymptomatic individuals pose a particular risk of transmission due to their unknown carrier status as demonstrated in the health care setting [6] . Despite the high percent of fatalities associated with MERS-CoV outbreaks on the Arabian Peninsula most epidemiological studies suggest R 0 values <1, indicative of a low risk of sustainable human-to-human transmission, whereas epidemiological studies from the South Korean outbreak describe R 0 values (>1) akin to more sustainable human-to-human transmission [7] . Recurring spillover events from dromedary camels (zoonotic reservoir for MERS-CoV on the Arabian Peninsula) likely contribute to newly diagnosed cases in humans [8] [9] [10] . The potential for continuous reintroduction to humans increases the risk of MERS-CoV adapting in humans to acquire enhanced human-tohuman transmission profiles, a scenario suspected to have initiated the SARS-CoV pandemic in 2002-2003 [11] . Effective public health measures and culling of civet cats, the zoonotic host for SARS-CoV, brought the SARS-CoV pandemic to a rapid end [11] . Eliminating MERS-CoV through culling of infected camel herds is not a practical solution. Furthermore, detection of pre-emergent MERS-CoV-like, and SARS-CoV-like, strains circulating in bat species indicate that the natural environment is ripe for future human exposures to potentially pathogenic coronaviruses [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, the development of therapeutic countermeasures that can interfere with MERS-CoV pathogenesis is critical to break zoonotic-to-human and human-to-human transmission cycles that may instigate global spread.",

            "text": "Evaluating the toxicity and efficacy of novel MERS-CoV therapeutics require the availability of animal models that effectively recapitulate MERS-CoV pathogenesis during fatal cases of human infections. Therefore, the first question in generating a MERS-CoV animal model would be: What are the pathological features of a human infection? Limited histopathological findings from human autopsies indicate that fatal cases of MERS-CoV results from pneumonia initiated by infection of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) [15, 16] . Pneumonia in the LRT is also the prominent finding on radiographs from X-rays and CTs of diagnosed human cases [17] . High viral loads in tracheal aspirates from patients are also associated with severe pulmonary disease [18] , which is indicative of actively replicating MERS-CoV in the LRT. Initial evaluation of the human MERS-CoV EMC/2012 isolate in rhesus macaques demonstrated replication in the LRT with mild pneumonia-like disease ( Fig. 1 ) [28] . Achieving respiratory pathology reflecting a lethal human disease proved to be more complicated in nonhuman primates. Severe respiratory disease in the marmoset produced clinical endpoints consistent with fatal disease that required euthanasia ( Fig. 1) [29, 30] . Evaluation of two human isolates, Jordan and EMC/2012, and a tissue cultureadapted MERS-CoV strain (MERS-0) in nonhuman primates resulted in mild disease in rhesus macaques or marmosets ( Fig. 1 ) [31] [32] [33] , confounding the reproducibility of near-lethal disease in NHPs. Nonhuman primates are central to late-stage preclinical evaluation of therapeutic countermeasures, but may be impractical for initial preclinical studies. A small animal model may be applicable if there is limited therapeutic available for toxicity and efficacy testing, especially if large animal numbers are needed to determine confidence and reproducibility.",

Overexpression of a mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with changes in the contact residues at the DPP4/RBD altered cellular profiles from resistant to susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [52, 53, 56] .

Knock-in of full-length hDPP4 rendered mice susceptible to human isolates of MERS-CoV at low infection doses ( Fig. 1 ) [38] [39] [40] . Knock-in mice exhibited severe pulmonary pathology and increased mortality; however, widespread constitutive expression of full-length hDPP4 resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV infection and replication in extrapulmonary tissues [38] [39] [40] . In some studies, higher viral loads could be detected in the brain compared to the lungs [39, 40] . Mice with infections of the central nervous system (CNS) exhibited encephalitis that corresponded with the kinetics of mortality [39] . Currently, there is no evidence to support a CNS component associated with MERS-CoV pathogenesis in humans. Attempts to restrict hDPP4 expression to epithelial cells of the lungs using constitutive tissue specific promoters (e.g., cytokeratin K18) yielded outcomes similar to those observed with SARS-CoV mouse models, wherein high levels of MERS-CoV infection/replication were detected in the brains (Fig. 1 ) [39] .",

Retaining the mDPP4 5 0 and 3 0 genetic elements that regulate expression maintained inherent expression profiles of full-length hDPP4 in mice [41] . Importantly, MERS-CoV infection/replication was readily detected in the lungs with little involvement of extrapulmonary tissues [41] . Infection with human isolates of MERS-CoV caused moderate respiratory pathology with mortality determined by euthanasia of mice at 20% weight loss [41] . Unfortunately, commercial restrictions limit the availability and use of this model to the broader scientific community. In addition to the concerns raised above, the first generation of mouse models was developed with the full-length hDPP4, which may alter the inherent physiological properties of the mouse.",

            "text": "The multifaceted involvement of DPP4 in maintaining immune homeostasis is of significant importance regarding susceptibility to infectious disease [57] . DPP4 exists in two forms: (1) a membrane anchored form on the surface of multiple cells types (e.g., B cells, T cells, NK cells, and epithelial cells to mention a few) and (2) a secreted form that can be identified in human serum [57] . DPP4 interacts with and modifies heterologous protein molecules involved in nociception, neuroendocrine function, metabolism, cardiovascular function, immune regulation, and infection [57] . Modification of heterologous protein function can proceed through cleavage of N-terminal amino acids through the enzymatic activity of the \u03b1/b-hydroxylase domain, or allosteric interaction/ signal transduction [57] . The species specificity of DPP4 is exemplified by the interaction of hDPP4 with adenosine deaminase (ADA), a well-recognized binding partner of hDPP4, which modulates downstream T cell functions [58] [59] [60] . The hDPP4/ADA interaction evolved in higher mammalian species (human, NHP, bovine, rabbit), but not in mouse or rat [58] [59] [60] . Interestingly, in one study ADA was demonstrated to block infection of MERS-CoV in tissue culture [20] , indicating that the binding site on hDPP4 for ADA, and the MERS-CoV RBD, may overlap. Consequently, introducing full-length hDPP4 into mice may skew innate immune mechanisms that could influence responses to therapeutic countermeasures.",

Li et al. recently developed a mouse model wherein the mDPP4 genomic region encompassing exons 10-12 were replaced with the respective genomic region from hDPP4, referred to as an hDPP4 knock-in model (hDPP4-KI) [43]. Exons 10-12 encode contact amino acids at the hDPP4/MERS-CoV RBD interface that were able to support replication of human MERS-CoV isolates in the lungs, but did not elicit a mortality phenotype [43] . Adaptive evolution of human MERS-CoV in the hDPP4-KI mouse resulted in mouseadapted viruses that evoked a lethal respiratory phenotype with little involvement of extrapulmonary tissues. The lethal respiratory phenotype is a consequence of novel mutations acquired during adaptive evolution. A combination of mutations in both the S1 and S2 regions of the MERS-CoV spike protein facilitated a lethal respiratory phenotype [43] . Results in the hDPP4-KI model substantiate an earlier mouse model referred to as the 288-330 +/+ model, which was designed with only two amino acid changes in mDPP4 to generate MERS-CoV susceptible mice.",

            "text": "Genetic engineering and implementation of the 288-330 +/+ mouse model, combined with MERS-CoV adaptive evolution, is the subject of this chapter. Initial studies in tissue culture revealed that human and rodent cell types were resistant to MERS-CoV infection upon overexpression of mDPP4; however, overexpression of hDPP4 conferred permissivity to infection/replication [53] . Comparative structural modeling of hDPP4 and mDPP4 revealed putative contact residues in mDPP4 amenable to modification at the DPP4/RBD interface. Modification of two amino acids (A288L and T330R) was sufficient to endow mDPP4 with the capacity to mediate MERS-CoV infection/replication [53] . Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV into humans in 2012, the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology became available for applications to modify mammalian genomes in vitro and in vivo [61] [62] [63] . Recognizing our unique situation, we designed CRISPR/Cas9 targets to modify the mouse genome encoding amino acids A288 and T330 in exons 10 and 11 of the mDPP4 gene (Fig. 3) [12, 42] . Concomitant with mouse development, in vitro studies were initiated to adapt MERS-CoV to the modified mDPP4 [42] . Tissue culture adaption resulted in MERS-0 virus, which contained an RMR insertion and S885L mutation in the S2 region of the MERS-CoV spike protein [42] . A MERS-0 molecular clone exhibited enhanced replication kinetics and higher titers compared to human MERS-CoV isolates. Additionally, the MERS-0 virus replicated to higher levels in the lungs of 288-330 +/+ mice, compared to human and camel MERS-CoV isolates [42] . Based on these data the MERS-0 virus was used to initiate passaging in mice heterozygous for mDPP4 with A288L and T330R mutations, 288-330 +/\u00c0 (Fig. 4) . We reasoned that adaptation around one expressed copy of the mDPP4 with 288-330 mutations, and a wild-type mDPP4 expressed copy, might cultivate generation of a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that could utilize wild-type mDPP4 as the primary receptor. After 15 passages we obtained a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS15c2) exhibiting a lethal respiratory phenotype in the 288-330 +/+ mice [42] . Our MERS-CoV reverse genetic system was used to generate an infectious clone of the mouse-adapted virus, icMERSma1 [42] . Lethal respiratory pathology with icMERSma1 required high infectious doses (5 \u00c2 10 6 Pfu). An additional 20 passages of icMERSma1 in 288-330 +/\u00c0 mice bore a novel mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that produced lethal respiratory disease at doses of 5 \u00c2 10 5 Pfu, and lung pathology associated with severe respiratory disease at 5 \u00c2 10 4 to 5 \u00c2 10 5 Pfu [44] (Fig. 1) . This MERS-CoV model system (288-330 +/+ mice and mouseadapted MERS-CoV viruses) is now being employed to: (1) understand complex virus-host interactions [12, 31, 42, [64] [65] [66] [67] , (2) evaluate antibody-based therapeutics [42] , (3) evaluate drug-based therapeutic countermeasures [68] , and (4) evaluate anti-MERS-CoV vaccines [42, 66] . The goal of this chapter is to provide an outline of how to rationally design a mouse with altered susceptibility to MERS-CoV. For additional information there are a number of detailed reviews and book chapters describing the design and utilization of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for generating mouse models [69, 70] . . Agarose gel separation based on size allows for discrimination between target DNA, Cas9 digested targets, and guide RNAs. (b) Schematic utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 technology to genetically engineer mice. Fertilized C57BL/6 J zygotes are collected and injected with RNA encoding Cas9, DPP4 single guide RNA, and oligos to facilitate homology-directed repair (HDR). Microinjected zygotes are implanted into pseudopregnant recipient female C57BL/6 J mice. Offspring are screened by sequencing for the intended change at positions 288 and 330. Mice identified as having the appropriate changes are backcrossed to C57BL/6 J mice to maintain the pure C57BL/6 J background, or may be crossed to any desired strain (e.g., BALB/cJ or 129S1/SvImJ). (c) Table describing sequences of Cas9 guide RNAs and oligos for HDR to genetically engineer amino acid changes at position 288 (Ala to Leu) and 330 (Thr to Arg). (d) Sequencing chromatograms highlighting how the F0 offspring from embryo implantation can be a mosaic of insertion/ deletions (InDel's) generated by random non-homologous end joining from Cas9 cutting at the genomic alleles, and the HDR repair that incorporates the intended changes encoding amino acids at positions 288 and 330. Pure homozygous 288-330 +/+ lines were obtained by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 J mice. The highlighted mutations CAA (TTG in the reverse orientation) and AGA encode the novel 288 L and 330R amino acids 9. After a predetermined number of passages the region encoding the spike protein of MERS-CoV is sequenced using RT-PCR to amplify the region of interest followed by standard Sanger sequencing (see Note 6).",

In the event that it is necessary to harvest cells for flow cytometry analysis or VetScan HM5 analysis, the BAL sample can be transferred to an empty tube or a tube containing EDTA, respectively. 8. All VetScan assays are performed under BSL3 conditions. Removal of samples for downstream analysis outside of BSL3 conditions require specific inactivation procedures that must be pre-approved by the institutional biosafety committee. Place 2\u00c2 medium bottle into 37 C bead bath. 4. Heat 0.8% agar in water in a microwave and place at 56 C. 5. Thaw lung samples in tubes filled with 1 mL of 1\u00c2 PBS and glass beads. 6. Once thawed, place into tissue homogenizer for 60 s. 7. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm ($15,000 \u00c2 g) for 5 min. 8. Transfer 50 \u03bcL of sample into 450 \u03bcL of PBS. Mix samples well. 9.

Virus plaques are visualized by neutral red staining (2 mL/ well) and using a lightbox. Count plaques to determine the number of plaque forming units per milliliter (Pfu/mL). Notes 1. It is not necessary to initiate MERS-CoV adaptation in tissue culture first, as was demonstrated by Li et al. [43]. Nonetheless, Cockrell et al. chose to initiate their MERS-CoV adaptation studies on tissue culture cells while the 288-330 +/+ mice were in the process of being generated[42]. Therefore, for the purposes of this chapter this is included as a potential starting point for MERS-CoV adaptation.2. Cockrell et al. initiated adaptation experiments with a rMERS-CoV expressing the tomato red protein in place of the Orf5 ORF[42,71,72].",
