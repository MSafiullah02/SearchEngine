In the present scenario, to carry out surgical procedures, patients' diagnostic test reports for SARS-CoV-2 might be sought, particularly in Head and Neck Cancer(HNC) patients, who are more prone to develop COVID-19, as inferred from a cohort study in China. [2] In cancer patients, suspension of oncology treatment can have serious repercussions and should be prioritized.",

Hence, inappropriate pre surgical screening for COVID-19 can be an impediment to safe HNC surgery.

While the viral tests making use of RT-PCR or qRT-PCR and ELISA tests detecting antibodies usually require laboratories or specific conditions [9] , rapid antibody tests can be done albeit any particular conditions. Although qRT-PCR remains the gold standard, it is not without fallibility. [5] . Its sensitivity varies depending on the kits and PCR instrument deployed [9] and mostly takes long to be processed. Rapid RT-PCR tests that have been launched are processed faster but require special armamentarium and only a few can be done at a time depending upon machine capabilities and supply of reagents. RT-PCR test in principle has 100% sensitivity. Nevertheless, due to biology of the disease, for instance, inappropriate timing of sample collection in relation to disease onset or the virus not being present in the particular location being tested at the particular time results in some false negatives. [3, 9] Other RT-PCR false negatives may be attributable to further problems, such as laboratories being under the cosh, substandard sample collection and preparation. [9] Healthcare practitioners must be aware of these problems as a single test report cannot be taken at face value.",

[6] [7] [8] Diagnostic tests should be correlated with clinical findings. While taking the history and during the oral examination, attention should be paid to features, such as dysgeusia/ageusia, dry mouth and exanthematous lesions like ulcers or blisters which might be initial symptoms of COVID-19, presenting even before fever, dry cough, and other quintessential clinical symptoms. Selfacknowledged loss of taste and smell might be owed to the cellular entry receptors of SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2) and is a much stronger predictor of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis than selfdisclosed fever. [10] Testing via saliva or GCF samples may be valuable and dentists and oral surgeons might play a pivotal role in early diagnosis. Hence, the practitioner must be apprised with the expression of the disease and test modalities available. The results should be interpreted prudently, and the clinicians must use their acumen while corroborating the results with the patient's history and clinical findings for their HNC patients. ",
