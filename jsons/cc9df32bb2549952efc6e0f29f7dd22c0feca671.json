Study design: A cross-sectional study was performed of 226 patients admitted with confirmed CoV respiratory tract infection between 2010 and 2016. Variables consistent with a severe disease burden were evaluated including symptoms, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. Results: CoVs represented 11.3% of all positive respiratory virus samples and OC43 was the most commonly identified CoV. The majority of infections were community-associated while 21.6% were considered nosocomial. The average length of stay was 11.8 days with 17.3% of patients requiring ICU admission and an all-cause mortality of 7%.

Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the need for improved epidemiological surveillance and a better understanding of the health burden imposed by CoVs, as well as other non-influenza RNA respiratory viruses [7] . Four types of endemic CoVs are in current circulation, OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. Recent findings demonstrate a seasonality for CoV infections, with peak numbers being observed in the winter months [2] . However, this data is based on nationally-reported findings from the United States, and may not reflect local or national epidemiology in Canada. Moreover, the receptor-binding domain of the glycoprotein of 229E has undergone adaptation over the last 50 years [8] that ongoing viral evolution may influence which strains predominate from year to year. This is further supported by phylogenetic data examining OC43 isolates, which showed that the circulating genotypes in southeast Asia changed over time [9] . A recent study in the midwestern USA reported frequent identification of HKU1, whereas a separate study from China reported OC43 to be more prevalent [10, 11] .

More recent four-year prevalence data from military personnel in the USA revealed season-to-season variability where OC43 and 229E alternated as the most common strain identified [23] .
