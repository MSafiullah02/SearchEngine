There also are potential threats from deliberate exposures with uncommonly seen yet virulent agents such as anthrax, plague, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers. In these circumstances, it is almost impossible for a clinician to stay fully informed about the variety of signs, symptoms, routes of transmission, virulence and other important factors related to risk of transmission.",

Fortunately, dental health care workers follow a set of standard infection control precautions. In 1985, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, established \u201cUniversal Precautions,\u201d a set of infection control practices based on the concept that all blood and bodily fluids that might be contaminated with blood should be treated as infectious. These were designed to prevent transmission of HIV, HBV and other bloodborne pathogens in all health care settings. In 1996, CDC expanded this guidance into \u201cStandard Precautions,\u201d a standard of care designed to protect health care personnel and patients from pathogens that can be spread by blood or any other bodily fluid, excretion or secretion. Standard Precautions are the foundation of a comprehensive infection control program and include a group of infection control practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which health care is delivered, including dental settings.",

Exposure to 2009 H1N1 influenza virus occurs in household, community and occupational settings, and transmission is thought to occur through droplet exposure of mucosal surfaces; through indirect contact, usually via the hands, with respiratory secretions from an infectious patient or contaminated surface; and through inhalation of small-particle aerosols in the vicinity of the infectious person. In theory, any measure that limits the dispersal of respiratory droplets should reduce the opportunity for transmission. An important element added to Standard Precautions in 2007 was respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette.1 Basic principles of this etiquette include the following:",
