Benefits of a quick end-of-outbreak 11 declaration, such as reductions in trade/travel restrictions, must be balanced against the chance of 12 flare-ups from undetected residual cases. We show how epidemiological modelling can be used 13 to estimate the surveillance level required for decision-makers to be confident that an outbreak is 14 over. Results from a simple model characterising an Ebola outbreak suggest that a surveillance 15 sensitivity (i.e. case reporting percentage) of 79% is necessary for 95% confidence that an 16 outbreak is over after 42 days without symptomatic cases. With weaker surveillance, 17 unrecognised transmission may still occur: if the surveillance sensitivity is only 40%, then 62 18 days must be waited for 95% certainty. By quantifying the certainty in end-of-outbreak 19 declarations, public health decision-makers can plan and communicate more effectively. 20 21 Keywords 22 Ebola virus disease; End-of-outbreak declarations; World Health Organization; Outbreak 23 forecasting; Surveillance 24 2 25 Main Text 26",

However, the difficulty of end-of-outbreak 40 decision-making was illustrated during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic, when the World Health 41 Organization (WHO) declared Liberia disease-free four times only to have new cases detected 42 after the first three declarations (Fig 1A) .

            "text": "To illustrate how the confidence that an outbreak is over can be estimated, and that the 60 confidence level can be increased by improving surveillance, we consider the situation of 61 declaring the end of an Ebola outbreak. The WHO considers an Ebola outbreak to be over once 62 42 days have passed since the last possible exposure to a confirmed case without any new cases 63 being detected (10), with this rule most often deployed at the scale of a single country. The 64 incubation period (the time between an individual becoming infected and displaying 65 recognisable symptoms) for Ebola has been estimated to be in the range of 2-21 days (11), and so 66 the period of 42 days is based on two maximal incubation periods. For a disease that is 67 transmitted directly from person-to-person, the passing of two incubation periods is 68 epidemiologically relevant because additional between-person transmission is then unlikely. We 69 use mathematical modelling to show that, if the surveillance sensitivity is 100%, then it is likely 70 4 that an Ebola outbreak is over after 42 days without symptomatic cases. However, we also 71 demonstrate that, if the surveillance sensitivity is lower, there is an increased chance of 72 undetected infected cases remaining after 42 days. This leads to a lower confidence that the 73 outbreak is over after this time period. 74 75 Although we focus on Ebola virus disease here, we note that the question of whether or not an 76 infectious disease outbreak is over is not only important for diseases of humans, but also those of 77 animals and plants. Declaring an outbreak over allows disease management interventions to be 78 lifted, including restrictions on travel (12) and plant trade quarantine (13). The idea that 79 improved surveillance may lead to increased confidence in an end-of-outbreak declaration is 80 related to well-established theory regarding conducting surveys to ascertain the absence of a 81 pathogen (see e.g. (14-19) ). In that context, the more hosts are tested and found to be disease-82 free, the higher the confidence that the entire population is disease-free. This can in turn be used 83 to generate sample-size requirements to establish freedom from disease to pre-specified 84 confidence levels. While initial studies in this area -motivated by the desire to limit pathogen 85 transmission via the animal trade -assumed that the level of disease in the host population was 86 static, more recent elaborations have included incorporation of dynamic models describing 87 parasite/pathogen transmission in the host population (see e.g. (20,21)). Statistical disease 88 freedom studies have not only been applied to animal disease epidemics, but the theory has also 89 been used in the context of epidemics in populations of plants (22, 23) and humans (24). 90 91 In this paper, rather than considering surveys of the host population at the apparent end of an 92 outbreak, we show how the confidence in end-of-outbreak assessments can be estimated using 93 5 epidemiological models once the surveillance system sensitivity has been approximated. Our 94 approach, which can be used when the outbreak in question is still ongoing, provides decision-95 makers with a practical way to gauge whether current surveillance efforts will be sufficient to 96 declare the outbreak over with conviction, or whether an intensification of surveillance is 97 necessary instead. 98 99",

Additional new 140 cases could only occur if existing infected individuals remained pre-symptomatic, and this was 141 very unlikely after this time period.

With such a low surveillance sensitivity, a period of 62 days 145 with no cases would need to elapse to be 95% confident that an outbreak is over (light green line 146 in Fig 1D) , or 88 days to be 99% confident (dark green line in Fig 1D) . decision-makers to be confident that Ebola outbreaks are over after 42 days.

            "text": "Ebola outbreaks are over in future, we note that surveillance during the outbreak alone is not 191 always sufficient. In the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, additional cases occurred after 192 regions were declared disease-free due to factors including persistently infected sources (37) Extending our approach to other disease outbreaks might require elaborations to the underlying 209 model. To illustrate the principle that the surveillance sensitivity affects the confidence in end-210 of-outbreak declarations, we modelled surveillance as simply as possible -by assuming that a 211 proportion of infectious hosts report disease, but that reporting did not impact on the underlying 212 transmission process. In practice, individuals that report disease are more likely to be subject to 213 interventions that reduce infectiousness or shorten their infectious period, such as isolation or 214 treatment. This could straightforwardly be built into the framework that we have presented. We 215 also use a single parameter to denote the surveillance sensitivity, whereas in practice a 216 surveillance program is likely to encompass many aspects, including both passive and active case 217 finding strategies, that could be built explicitly into an epidemiological model. One of the 218 benefits of our approach is that, in contrast to methods relying on surveys to prove disease 219 absence, our analysis can be conducted in advance of the apparent end of the outbreak to see 220 whether or not surveillance needs to be intensified. However, it might be possible to combine our 221 approach with surveys to establish the end of an outbreak, and to make use of statistical methods 222 for estimating the number of hosts to survey so that the probability of the population being 223 disease-free exceeds a pre-specified threshold (14-24).

There were suspicions of a flare-194 up arising from a female survivor, who became infectious after her immune system was 195 weakened due to pregnancy (39), although this remains unproven (40). There is also evidence 196 that Ebola survivors might have the potential to drive new cases after long periods following 197 apparent recovery (41), for example reports of the virus being detected in semen up to 18 months 198 after symptom onset or isolated in cell culture up to 82 days after symptom onset (42,43). Here, 199 we only considered potential flare-ups due to unreported cases, and did not explicitly model the 200 possibility that Ebola survivors, who were assumed to have fully recovered, might drive 201 additional cases. Recrudescence from survivors could, in theory, be included in assessments of 202 the risk of outbreak flare-ups after outbreaks are declared over, however this would require 203 sufficient understanding of the epidemiology of these rare events. While this understanding is 204 developed, targeted monitoring of survivors beyond the WHO guideline period of 42 days that 205we consider here is also important. This should be supplemented with advice for survivors on 206 safe practices that will help to avoid additional flare-ups (44). 207 10 208",

Additional refinement would be needed to estimate 229 the confidence in end-of-outbreak declarations when diseases that persist at low endemic levels 230 11 in a population have returned below an outbreak threshold prevalence, an important 231 consideration for outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and yellow fever. Nonetheless, we have 232 demonstrated that measurement of the sensitivity of surveillance can help decision-makers 233 estimate their confidence that an outbreak has ended. Moreover, after measuring the 234 performance of disease surveillance systems, the confidence that an outbreak has ended can be 235 increased by optimising the surveillance system. 236 237Communicating the confidence in end-of-outbreak decisions, as our framework permits, is 238 helpful for decision-makers and the public, and it will increase trust in public health 239 organisations such as WHO. Measurements of the surveillance sensitivity during outbreaks are 240 not always routinely taken, but we think that by providing a useful way to use measures of 241 surveillance system performance, decision-makers will be motivated to implement what should 242 be considered as good practice. We encourage the use of quantitative approaches, such as the one 243 we describe here, to inform decisions regarding the continuation of disease control measures, 244 appropriate use of resources, and communication of public health messages to the public",
