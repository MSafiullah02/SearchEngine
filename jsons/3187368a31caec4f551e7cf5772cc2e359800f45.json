However, their use is often limited by toxicities and resistance. Agents with novel mechanisms and favorable toxicity profiles are critically needed. We review recent developments in CMV antivirals and immune-based approaches to mitigating CMV infection. Recent Findings Letermovir, an inhibitor of the CMV terminase complex, was approved in 2017 for primary CMV prophylaxis in adult seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients. Maribavir, an inhibitor of the CMV UL97 kinase, is currently in two phase 3 treatment studies. Adoptive immunotherapy using third-party T cells has proven safe and effective in preliminary studies. Vaccine development continues, with several promising candidates currently under study. Summary No longer limited to DNA polymerase inhibitors, the prevention and treatment of CMV infections in the HCT recipient is a rapidly evolving field which should translate into improvements in CMV-related outcomes.",

All of these agents target the CMV DNA polymerase encoded by the UL54 gene (pUL54) to ultimately inhibit viral DNA synthesis. While these agents have dramatically reduced the burden of CMV infection in the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipient [1] , their use is often limited by toxicities such as myelosuppression and renal injury, and the development of resistance [2] . Therefore, agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed. In 2017, letermovir became the first antiCMV agent with a mechanism of action other than inhibition of DNA polymerase activity to be approved by the FDA. This review will discuss recent developments in CMV antiviral agents and non-pharmacological interventions that may augment the ability to prevent and treat CMV infections in HCT recipients.",

The core terminase complex is comprised of the proteins pUL51, pUL56, and pUL89; all three proteins are necessary for terminase function [4, 5] . Targeting the terminase complex represents an attractive therapeutic option since host cellular DNA replication does not require terminase functions and all three terminase proteins are individually essential for viral replication [6] .

Letermovir prophylaxis at 480 mg/day (240 mg/ day if co-administered with cyclosporine) was begun at a median of 9 days after HCT and continued through week 14 post-HCT, and during this time, weekly CMV PCR monitoring was performed. Preemptive therapy was initiated upon detection of viremia according to local practice, with protocol-suggested viral load thresholds of 150 copies/mL in high-risk patients and 300 copies/mL in non-high-risk patients. Patients with detectable viremia prior to randomization were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. Letermovir prophylaxis met the primary endpoint of reduction in clinically significant CMV infection (requiring initiation of preemptive therapy or CMV disease) compared with placebo at 24 weeks (17.5% vs 41.8%). Since CMV disease was uncommon in both groups, this endpoint was largely defined by reduction in the need for initiation of preemptive therapy; as such, the benefit of letermovir prophylaxis will depend on the viral load threshold for initiating preemptive therapy. Importantly, letermovir prophylaxis was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality at 24 weeks, with this benefit being predominantly among high-risk patients. As CMV disease was rare and no single predominant cause of death was identified [23\u2022] , the reason(s) for the mortality benefit at week 24 remain unclear. The reduction in mortality appeared to correlate with the prevention of CMV viremia, raising the hypothesis that the beneficial impact of letermovir prophylaxis may be related to preventing indirect negative effects of CMV infection [24] [25] [26] . Adverse events including gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea), myelotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were similar in the letermovir and placebo groups. Based on these results, letermovir was approved by the FDA for primary CMV prophylaxis in adult CMV seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients [17] .",

UL56 genotyping was successful in 50 out of 79 patients (63%) who received letermovir prophylaxis and experienced CMV infection through week 24. Four UL56 resistance mutations were identified in 3 patients (6% of 50 patients analyzed). These 3 patients represented 16.7% of patients (N = 18) who experienced CMV infection while receiving letermovir prophylaxis and for whom UL56 genotyping was successfully performed. One of the 3 patients was viremic at the time letermovir prophylaxis was initiated (viral load < 151 copies/mL) and another patient missed 5 doses of letermovir. Of the four UL56 resistance mutations identified, two were previously documented resistance mutations (V236M and C235W), and two were novel mutations (E237G and R369T) at positions previously demonstrated to confer resistance in vitro [27, 28] . There were no UL89 substitutions documented that had previously had been identified as conferring resistance in vitro [30]; UL51 was not analyzed.

The reason for this difference is not entirely clear, but one possibility is that cell conditions modulate the activity of cellular kinases which can compensate for loss of pUL97 activity in the presence of maribavir [53] . Indeed, the addition of cellular kinase inhibitors reduces the maribavir EC 50 in HFFs to values comparable to HELs [53] . Since maribavir inhibits pUL97 activity and ganciclovir depends on pUL97-mediated phosphorylation for its activity, maribavir and ganciclovir are antagonistic [53] . Maribavir retains activity against most CMV strains resistant to DNA polymerase inhibitors [46, 54, 55] but, similar to letermovir, is not active against other herpesviruses [55] .",

Forty patients were randomized to each treatment dose arm; of these approximately 40% were HCT recipients. 64.2% had asymptomatic infection, and end-organ disease was present in 13.3%. The median viral load at baseline was 3.7 log 10 copies/mL. Eighty-six patients (72%) achieved an undetectable viral load. CMV-associated clinical manifestations improved in 24/34 (71%) patients and resolved in 6/34 (18%) by week 6 of treatment. Twenty-five patients (29%) who cleared viremia subsequently experienced CMV recurrence while receiving maribavir; 13 (52%) of these were associated with the emergence of maribavir-resistant virus (discussed below). The recurrence rate was lower among HCT recipients (26%) than among SOT recipients (40%) despite similar rates of virologic clearance (70% vs 64%, respectively). All efficacy endpoints were similar across all doses. Altered taste was the most common adverse effect (65%) but this resulted in treatment discontinuation in only one patient. Overall, this study demonstrated that maribavir may be a valid option in the setting of resistant or refractory infection, but the high rate of recurrence while on therapy and the associated emergence of maribavir resistance represent cause for concern.

Filociclovir, similar to GCV, is a nonobligate chain terminator of DNA synthesis that requires initial phosphorylation by pUL97, followed by additional phosphorylation steps performed by cellular kinases to its active triphosphate form [79] [80] [81] [82] . Filociclovir EC 50 values for CMV strains are approximately 0.2-0.3 \u03bcM, which are~5fold less than for GCV [78, [83] [84] [85] . The increased potency of filociclovir compared with GCV in vitro may reflect the findings that filociclovir is a better substrate for pUL97 than GCV [80, 86] and the CMV DNA polymerase incorporates filociclovir-triphosphate into DNA more efficiently than GCV-triphosphate [82] . Filociclovir displays little cytotoxicity at concentrations required to inhibit CMV replication in a variety of cell types [81] and demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of CMV infection [87] . In addition to CMV, filociclovir is active against HHV-6 but not HSV1, HSV2, or VZV [81] .",

This has proven a challenge, and there are no vaccines currently available for use. ASP0113 was a DNA vaccine encoding glycoprotein B (gB), which is capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies, and the tegument protein pp65, which is a primary target of T cell responses [96, 97] . Unfortunately, ASP0113 failed to meet primary (overall mortality, CMV disease) or secondary (time to viremia and use of preemptive therapy) endpoints in a placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in HCT recipients [96] . ASP0113 also failed to meet the primary endpoint of reducing the risk of viremia through 1 year after transplant compared with placebo in a phase 2 study in CMV D+/R-renal transplant [98] .",

The pentameric complex consists of gH/gL/pUL128/pUL130/pUL131, is required for CMV entry into several clinically relevant cell types, and elicits potent neutralizing antibody responses that block entry into those cells [96, 99] . A CMV vaccine candidate (V160) incorporating the pentameric complex was constructed from the live attenuated CMV AD169 strain that was further engineered to be replication-defective in the absence of a synthetic compound called Shield-1 [100] . Recently, this vaccine was found to be safe and elicited robust levels of neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses when administered to CMV-seronegative subjects in a phase 1 study [101, 102] . Several other candidate vaccines are currently being evaluated in phase 1 and 2 trials in adult and pediatric HCT recipients [96] .",
