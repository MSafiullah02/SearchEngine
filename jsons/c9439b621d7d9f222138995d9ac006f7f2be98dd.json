However, in terms of one of the most important outcome measures-maximizing the potential from deceased donation-international experience and the balance of evidence suggest that a superior framework involves dedicated donor coordinators based in potential donor hospitals. In some of the countries with the highest deceased donation rates, such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy, there are donor coordinators based in every hospital in the country [ 5 ] . They play an important role in increasing and maintaining donation awareness and provide education and support to the staff of potential donor hospitals. Donor coordinators will often help approach the donor family, participate in acquiring consent or authorization for donation, provide help with donor management in the critical care unit, and support the donor family during the process of donation. Donor coordinators will also liaise with legal authorities to facilitate donation and ensure that surmountable legal obstacles do not prevent organ donation. Donor coordinators will then inform organ retrieval teams and coordinate the retrieval process. The responsibility for transporting retrieval teams to donor hospitals and organs to their destinations may rest with the donor coordinator, with the transplant units, or be shared between them. The regionalization of donation services, together with a uniform approach to the travel arrangements, is probably going to improve the quality and safety of the travel services for the donor team [ 1 ] .",

            "text": "Improvement in the medical and surgical treatment of cardiac diseases has enhanced the longevity of the population and led to a constant increase in heart failure cases; after the clinical introduction of cyclosporine in the early 1980s, heart transplantation has represented the treatment of choice for end-stage heart failure. Through June 30, 2013, 116,104 cardiac transplants have been performed in more than 416 hospitals worldwide [ 21 ] . The notable increase of patients listed for heart transplantation has demanded a consequent modifi cation of standard and traditional donor criteria [ 22 ] that were introduced in the early years of the cardiac transplant programs. Moreover, the increase in organ demand caused a shortage of available hearts, producing, in turn, the adoption of more severe recipient criteria that limit the number of patients in transplant lists [ 23 , 24 ] . For this reason, certain donor criteria have been expanded to raise the available donor pool, considering and accepting the so-called marginal donors. In this case, we emphasize that attention should be oriented toward an individual evaluation of the recipient/donor, recognizing the patient hemodynamic status/ urgency and not only the expanded criteria. Each potential recipient should be accurately evaluated, avoiding transplantation in patients with serious generalized disease, e.g., a septic status. Clinical judgment is needed to decide which marginal donor is adequate for our patient transplantation. When wall motion abnormalities are found at echocardiography and the left ventricular ejection fraction is <0.45, even though the donor is stable with inotropic support, before the organ is refused, hemodynamic and metabolic management should be performed [ 25 , 26 ] ; stress echocardiography can be helpful in recognizing hearts eligible for donation. Stress Echocardiography Dipyridamole stress echocardiography, performed in brain-dead potential donors with left ventricular resting global or discrete wall motion abnormalities, identifi es hearts with severe morphologic abnormalities that were not considered for donation from eligible donors who showed an improvement in regional wall motion during stress (viability response) and normal function and coronary anatomy following transplantation [ 27 ] . Age and Ischemic Time In the early phases of transplant programs, donors older than 40 were excluded from the donor pool. However, donor shortage promoted the acceptance of donors up to 50 or 60 [ 28 -31 ]. Using hearts from older donors, the outcome depends on other factors, chiefl y ischemic time, which, when longer than 3-4 h, is associated with increased early mortality [ 32 -37 ]. Lamour et al. [ 38 ] found that a 40-year-old recipient with congenital heart disease who received a 50-year-old donor heart with 3-h ischemic time had a 15 % probability of death within 1 year, compared with a 40 % probability of death within 1 year if that donor's ischemic time was 5 h. As indicated by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [ 37 ], donors younger than 45 may be acceptable even with undesirable characteristics such as prolonged ischemic time, recipient comorbidities, and previous recipient operations with hemodynamically destabilizing bleeding. Hearts from donors between the ages of 45-55 should safely implant when the projected ischemic time is \u22644 h and the potential recipient does not have comorbidities or surgical issues; donor hearts >55 years should be accepted carefully and balance the pros and cons for the recipient (Table 3.

            "text": "Conversely, large multi-institutional studies [ 32 , 33 ] and the International Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry [ 47 ] reported increased mortality in heart transplant recipients receiving older donor hearts. These differences are probably due to the smaller number of patients and short follow-up time in individual studies. Lietz et al. [ 48 ] found a direct correlation between increasing donor age and the risk of transplantrelated coronary artery disease. At the fi rst annual coronarography, they found that when compared with donors younger than 20, the third, fourth, and fi fth decades of donor life increase the risk of CAD by 2.2-, 2.4-, and 2.6-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry data and other independent investigators [ 14 -16 ] have suggested that an ischemic time >4 h may increase the risk for death in recipients receiving hearts from donors older than 50 years. Lietz [ 48 ] revealed that ischemic time >4 h and donor death resulting from cerebrovascular accident significantly contributed to poor early posttransplant outcomes. At the same time, it is important to consider that end-stage heart failure presents a signifi cant risk of death while awaiting heart transplantation. The UNOS registry data (in the period 1991-1996) reveal that patients with blood group O have a median waiting time of 332 days; the median waiting time for patients >18 years old was 230 days [ 49 ] . Bennett et al. [ 50 ] outlined that despite the high risk resulting from the heart transplant, there was a clear longterm survival benefi t for status I recipients who received older donor hearts. The data described by Lietz [ 48 ] are signifi cant: in patients in status 1 (see Table 3 .3 ), 6-month mortality of 70 % was observed when on a waiting list, and the risk of death was 8.5 times higher than that of status 1 patients who received an allograft from donors >40 years old, with a resulting 14 % 6-month mortality; when an older donor heart was implanted, mortality increased 1.6 times but was not statistically signifi cantly different from recipients who received hearts from younger donors. Heart donors older than 70 should not be accepted; in our experience, two transplants utilizing 70-year-old donors were followed by early graft failure despite a short ischemic time.",

By separate sampling of pulmonary vein PaO 2 , it is possible to harvest at least one lung if the PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio is much better than in the sample obtained from the arterial peripheral catheter.

Through experimental studies on pigs, a perfusion solution was developed to prevent edema formation and the loss of lung function. The solution was designated Steen Solution\u00ae (Vitrolife; Gothenburg, Sweden). Steen Solution is an extracellular solution for lung preservation composed of electrolytes, dextran, and albumin. A noteworthy feature of the solution is its high oncotic pressure [ 99 ] . The fi rst clinical use of EVLP [ 100 ] was described in 2001: the donor was a 54-year-old man who had suffered cardiac arrest due to acute myocardial infarction. The transplantation to a recipient patient with pulmonary emphysema was successful. ELVP has been performed by several lung transplant centers worldwide with good results. At the Toronto Lung Transplant Program, from September 2008 to December 2011, 253 lung transplants were performed with conventional preservation lungs. Primary graft dysfunction grade three at 72 h was recorded in 2 % EVLP vs. 8.5 % control ( P = 0.14), and time on mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal life support, ICU stay, hospital stay, and 30-day mortality were not different.

All general clinical conditions, including biochemical, morphological, and functional conditions, must be considered for the donors and their organs to balance the decision regarding whether a liver graft can be used. The classical clinical and morphological exclusion criteria of the hepatic donor, which years ago would have absolutely contraindicated donation, have now become relative contraindications. These criteria must only be considered if several contraindications occur simultaneously. Based on different studies, the principal liver viability marker is its gross and microscopic inspection. Less than 40 % steatosis evaluated on liver biopsy is fundamental to assure the normal function of the implanted graft, but in the absence of other contraindications, a steatosis of 50 % can be considered for the transplantation of the whole liver for special recipients at risk of dropout from the waiting list (HCC patients). Split-liver transplantation, a procedure where one donor liver is divided into two hemilivers for two recipients, is an important tactic for overcoming organ shortage. To date, the principal benefi ciaries have been adult/pediatric pairs, and excellent outcomes have been described. However, the criteria for the liver-splitting technique require much more restrictive criteria than for conventional whole livers. Donor eligibility criteria for the split-liver procedure were as follows: age 55 or younger, no cardiac arrest episodes, less than 5 days in intensive care, low inotropic support (dopamine \u22645 mg/kg/min, dobutamine \u226410 mg/kg/min, and no epinephrine or norepinephrine requirement), Na+ \u2264155 mg/L, liver enzymes no more than double the normal, and no macroscopic evidence of hepatic steatosis, or less than 20 % hepatic steatosis if a biopsy was taken, because liver biopsy was not routinely performed. Liver-splitting techniques for two adults are still experimental surgical procedures, and they have interesting results when these restrictive criteria are employed for donors and for particular pairs of recipients in which one is of small size [ 102 ] .",

Hepatic donors' acceptance criteria that permit the use of HCV-positive donors without liver disease for HCV-positive recipients are increasing.

In addition to the contraindications previously mentioned, there are some particular absolute contraindications for a living donor. Donors having macrosteatosis (>20 %) on liver biopsy are rejected. Remnant liver volume cannot be less than 25 %. This is an issue especially when the right lobe graft is large. It is never an issue when the left lateral segment is the proposed graft and is rarely an issue if the left lobe graft is taken. The Human Organ Transplantation Act, in some countries, does not allow unrelated donation; this is to prevent donation under any type of coercion and to avoid any organ trade. The living donor should be between 18 and 55 years of age. A body mass index >30 for the donor is generally associated with a consistent degree of macrosteatosis; donors should be encouraged to reduce weight, and a liver biopsy should rule out liver steatosis >20 %. A liver attenuation index <5 on a plain CT scan is suggestive of steatosis. Such donors are either rejected or, in the absence of other donors, need to reduce weight, and a biopsy should be performed to rule out macrosteatosis >20 % [ 3 ] . Donors are also rarely rejected for anatomical reasons. Double artery, double portal vein, or multiple hepatic veins such as a V8 or a V6 can be anastomosed using specifi c surgical techniques, and these presentations should no longer preclude donation. However, multiple anatomical anomalies, e.g., a portal vein trifurcation with a right bile duct draining the segment IV, double right hepatic arteries in the donor, or multiple right-sided segmental portal vein tributaries draining into the left portal vein, are considered contraindications for LDLT. The majority of biliary anatomy in the donor is acceptable [ 106 ] .",

Additionally, the use of renal grafts from donors with HCV-positive antibodies in HCV-positive recipients can be considered without apparently increasing major morbidity or mortality. Chronic renal failure is also an absolute renal donor exclusion criterion.",

The best indication of the suitability of a pancreas allograft for transplantation is the appearance of the organ at the time of procurement. After completing the surgical maneuvers, the pancreatic parenchyma should be carefully evaluated for its procurement in terms of fat content, edema, or fi brosis and for quality of the vasculature. All aspects of the pancreas should be inspected for injury to the pancreatic parenchyma and for the presence of hematomas, masses, or nodular areas. Most centers avoid transplanting organs with calcifi cations, extensive fi brosis, fatty infi ltration, severe edema, or signifi cant visceral atherosclerosis. Depending from different center policies, pancreas procurement may be cancelled for technical reasons such as abnormal arterial vascularization between the liver and the pancreas, which may occur with a right replacing hepatic artery originating from the superior mesenteric artery and would render a successful and correct split and the transplantation of both organs diffi cult. Surgical injuries that occur during pancreas procurement may lead to complications after transplantation, impaired function of the allograft, graft loss, or even death of the patient. These injuries may be so dangerous that the pancreas harvesting must be considered an absolute contraindication. In such cases, pancreatic islet transplantation can be considered. Proper procurement and the constant training of surgeons for pancreatic procurement are therefore very important to maintain high-quality pancreas procurement. Some recent reports show that vascular lesions are observed in 16.7 % of pancreatic grafts and suggest that surgical procedures of pancreas procurement may be improved by better surgical training and the standardization of the surgical technique. Some studies have shown that pancreatic allografts have been frequently refused during back-table inspection, partly because of multiple surgical injuries to the artery, veins, and duodenum [ 108 ] . Donor age and procurement by centers not performing pancreas transplantations were both found to significantly increase the probability of pancreas refusal.",

Ideal donors are preferably younger (<45 years) and with little or no use of vasoactive drugs. Patients with short bowel syndrome present with the abdominal cavity retracted, thus requiring smaller donors (30-40 % less of the calculated body surface area). Preference is given to ABO identity. With the development of effective drugs for prophylaxis and the treatment of cytomegalovirus, seropositive donors are accepted and are avoided only for recipients with negative serology. The decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract and the use of antibodies in donor lymphocytes showed no benefi ts related to infection, rejection episodes, or incidences of graft versus host disease. Typically, in these donors also liver and pancreas are retrieved. Due to the shared bloodstream, the simultaneous harvesting of these grafts can be a challenge but is possible to perform the procedure without compromising other grafts [ 109 ] (Table 3 .6 ). ",
