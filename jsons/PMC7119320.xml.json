With improved histopathologic techniques and knowledge acquired from adult pathology, pediatric pathology, in the early years, was little more than an extrapolation and transposition of adult diseases and had a very limited field of investigation. Infections and tumors naturally occupied a major place; however, these sections were buried in chapters pertaining to the pathology of organs, which represented the basis of classification and organization in textbooks on anatomical pathology of the time. Then, many of the diseases and lesions identified in newborns, infants, and older children did not integrate well in the classical framework of adult pathology.",

The purpose of this article is to share some of the contributions, past and present, of pediatrics and pediatric pathology to the body of knowledge regarding human diseases. These contributions are grouped under 3 headings:1.The explosion of knowledge in genetics and the development of molecular methods.2.Infant immunologic na\u00efevet\u00e9 and vulnerability to infection.3.The unique nature of pediatric neoplasia.\n",

Recent investigations dissected part of this complex developmental process and have led to the discovery of the role of some important constitutional genes conserved throughout evolution, such as HOX and TBX1\n[1]. This gave birth to the recognition of the critical role of germline mutations as the cause of malformations, such as spina bifida, palatine division, holoprosencephaly, and DiGeorge syndrome. This initial step was essential as it enabled one to distinguish the embryo and malformative embryopathies, for example, DiGeorge syndrome, from the fetus and acquired, not inherited, deforming \u201cdysruption sequence\u201d fetopathies, for example, digital contractures and or amputations stemming from amniotic bands. As well, it served to establish a chronologic distinction between malformation and deformation and a simple manner in which to study their diverse etiologies. Later, the systematic practice of autopsies in infants revealed the unexpected incidence of severe malformations, especially those affecting organs in which development was complex, such as the brain, heart, and kidney.",

Dr Abbott was one of the first pediatric pathologists. The museum she founded was based on the pioneering works of Sir William Osler. This specimen was the first of many that, in time, facilitated the formulation of a cohesive classification of congenital heart defects and provided a foundation for the design of corrective surgical procedures. After Dr Abbott, Dr Frederick W. Wiglesworth, a distinguished pathologist at the Montreal Children's Hospital (Montreal, Quebec, Canada), maintained and continuously added to the collection from 1946 until 1972. The descriptions of the malformations corroborated those occasionally made by adult pathologists and later by radiologists using ultrasound. Benefiting from a superior technology, the latter demonstrated not only the frequency but also the latency that attends to some conditions, such as single umbilical artery, ureterocele, and annular pancreas.",

Thus, mutations of a mitochondrial gene involved in the respiratory chain are often expressed at birth, whereas those affecting the structure or metabolism of some amino acids (phenylalanine) or sugars (galactose) manifest months or even years postnatally. Such monogenic diseases have been regarded as \u201cerrors of nature,\u201d confirmed by the identification of an abnormal and sometimes measurable protein, the occasional success of substitutive therapy and the phenotype of \u201cknockout\u201d mice for the gene under study. These conditions, in some instances, may be diagnosed at birth or in utero. Appropriately treated, some patients survive to adulthood, for example, cystic fibrosis and \u03b1-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Study of the diverse expression of these disorders contributed original information related to the secrets of molecular metabolism and revealed unsuspected alternative pathways. Without cystic fibrosis, the role of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator might never have been discovered [3].",

This landmark discovery opened a new chapter in pediatrics, medicine, and genetics and shed light on the origin of a certain number of genetic conditions to be described in the coming years. The documentation of a monosomic deletion or translocation based on a peripheral blood leukocyte or skin and/or fascia lata fibroblast culture karyotype subsequently opened antenatal diagnosis (amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling), enabling one to localize and analyze genes in the fetus and infant.

Because these techniques require only a tiny amount of genetic material, they are widely applicable in pediatrics where they have demonstrated their value in discovering unexpected genetic variations and aberrations.

Four are cited.(a)Mutations in FOX P3 (Xp11.23) have been identified in a rare and lethal pediatric syndrome called IPEX (immunodeficiency, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) characterized by diverse autoimmune phenomena. The scurfy mouse, described in 1959, shares many similarities with boys with IPEX. In murine studies, FoxP3 is normally expressed by regulatory CD4+/CD25+ T cells that contribute to the maintenance of immune tolerance. Interestingly, FoxP3 is overexpressed in nonrejected allografts, confirming its tolerogenic role, thereby providing a new approach to monitor allograft rejection [10].(b)Robert P. Bolande, a creative pediatric and experimental pathologist, presented in 1974 [11] and redefined in molecular terms in 1997 [12], a novel, groundbreaking concept: \u201cthe neurocristopathies.\u201d Among a diverse group of afflictions, he recognized a common thread: the affected tissues were derived from the neural crest. Some of these conditions included neuroectodermal tumors, certain endocrine tumoral syndromes, Hirschprung's disease, and a syndrome of dysautonomia with congenital central hypoventilation, known as Ondine's curse. The recent discovery of mutations in PHOX2B that controls the expression of the RET gene, more directly implicated in familial forms of Hirschprung's disease and the tumoral syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A/B, has given a molecular confirmation to Ondine's curse and Bolande's prophetic conceptualization [13], [14].(c)Progeria of Hutchinson-Gilford, characterized by infantile premature aging, is associated with anomalies in the nuclear membrane linked to mutations in LMN (laminin and nuclear antigen) that encodes for progerine. This protein can be identified in fibroblast cultures from older individuals, thereby, opening an avenue of novel research on aging [15].(d)Most of the chondrodysplasias, from achondroplasia to dyschondrosteosis, and certain acromegalic dysplasias have been found to have an original molecular signature, illustrating that different mutations of the same gene can produce variable phenotypes.\n",

Other epidemiologic studies, as well as animal studies based on the ligature of the uterine arteries, have tended to support this association. Once more, this illustrates that certain diseases of adults take root in utero, as supported by the ultrasound finding of thickening of the aortic arch in the fetus and infants with development delay [17]. A systematic study of blood lipids in 599 adolescents discovered 2 children with unsuspected familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition, in a number of children, the serum lipid levels were abnormal, and this opened the debate about using screening tests in adolescents [18]. These represent additional unexpected contributions of pediatrics and pediatric pathology to adult pathology and preventive medicine.",

In due course, this virus was identified as the etiologic agent of infectious mononucleosis. Several years later, EBV was found to be important in the X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome, a rare condition described by David T. Purtilo, a pediatric pathologist [23]. In boys with a mutation in the XLP gene, infection by EBV leads to the development of 1 of 5 phenotypes; the most common (58%) is fulminant infectious mononucleosis. Mutations of the XLP gene likely contribute to fulminant infectious mononucleosis, a condition characterized by immunologic anarchy and death usually within 1 month after infection with EBV.",

Good, a prolific and creative pediatric immunologist, tower above all others. For one such condition, chronic granulomatous disease, Benjamin H. Landing, a brilliant pediatric pathologist, reported the initial description of pigmented macrophages in tissues of children with a syndrome of recurrent infections [24]. Not long thereafter, the pathogenesis of this disease was elucidated by the group led by Good [25]. Several years later, a clinical report described several newborns with neonatal tetany and impaired cellular immunity. At autopsy, they lacked a thymus and parathyroid glands and some had cardiac and great vessel abnormalities. In due course, this came to be known as the DiGeorge syndrome, named after the astute pediatric endocrinologist who described the condition [26]. Another clinical report at this time described a male infant with failure to thrive, repetitive serious infections, profound lymphopenia, but with serum immunoglobulins and the presence of plasma cells in tissues. In this child, the thymus was dysplastic: minute, devoid of Hassall corpuscles, and depleted of thymocytes [27]. In due course, the failure of the thymic epithelium to differentiate and mature came to be recognized as the morphologic hallmark of severe combined immunodeficiency. These 2 reports supported the experimental studies by Robert Good [28] in Minneapolis and Jacques Miller [29] in London on the critical role of the thymus in lymphocyte ontogeny, which led to the formulation of a dual immune system composed of T and B lymphocytes.",

These findings suggested an interruption in genetic messages that contributes to the malformation and neoplasm. With the passage of time, WAGR and Aniridia-Wilms' tumor syndromes are now known to represent contiguous gene or microdeletion syndromes [del(11)(p13)], in which deletions impact negatively on contiguous genes to produce the syndrome.

In these settings, pediatric pathology material will be examined by adult trained pathologists.
