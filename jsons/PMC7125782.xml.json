Both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 stimulators have been identified. These stimulators are often conserved within related antizyme genes but are often not conserved between distant relatives. There is strong evidence for multiple emergence/evolution of antizyme +1 frameshift stimulators. One of the known 3\u2032 stimulators is an RNA pseudoknot present in the orthologs of vertebrate antizymes 1 and 2 (though not antizyme 3).19., 20. Although a number of RNA pseudoknot structures are known to stimulate \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting events, the pseudoknot in vertebrate antizyme 1 and 2 was the first and is still the only, such structure known to stimulate +1 frameshifting. Despite an intensive search, a similar RNA pseudoknot could not be identified as being encoded in any of the invertebrate antizyme genes. Here, we report the discovery of a substantially different RNA pseudoknot in a subset of distantly related metazoan, but non-vertebrate, organisms. The newly discovered structure appears to have evolved independently, and is older than the previously known antizyme frameshifting pseudoknot stimulator.",

The nucleotide sequence of this gene was compared to all available antizyme sequences. After small adjustments in alignment, a total of seven antizyme genes coming from six different species showed significant nucleotide similarity in the same region (Figure 1). These seven antizyme sequences come from C. gigas, Lumbricus rubellas (an annelid roundworm with two paralogous antizyme genes), Amblyomma variegatum (an ixodid tick), Argopecten irradians (bay scallop), Trichinella spiralis (the nematode causative agent of trichinosis) and Dugesia japonica (a planaria). To assist with visualization of the phylogenetic data, the RNA sequence 3\u2032 of the frameshift site of oyster antizyme was drawn in the form of the putative pseudoknot with the position of alternative nucleotides in related pseudoknots indicated by an arrow, to generate a \u201cphylogenetic probing\u201d (i.e. in form similar to chemical probing). The results, shown in Figure 2(B)\n, demonstrate that 25 of 25 (100%) nucleotides in the putative pseudoknot \u201cloop\u201d regions are mutated in at least one of the six species examined. By contrast, only 17 of 44 (39%) nucleotides in \u201cstem\u201d regions differ. Moreover, in 13 of these 17 stem alterations the change is complementary (maintaining base-pairing). In three additional positions the change is at least sometimes complementary. Taken together, these data argue strongly in favor of functional significance of the proposed RNA pseudoknot.",

The cassette was inserted between two different fused luciferase genes and the level of frameshifting was measured by the dual luciferase assay.21 The \u201cwild-type\u201d cassette in this analysis consists of the last six sense codons of ORF1 and 79 nucleotides downstream of the frameshift site. Since the +1 frameshifting produced by this construct is substantial, 13.5%, even without added polyamines, the working assumption in subsequent experiments is that the mammalian system recapitulates fairly closely the events occurring in translation of the oyster antizyme gene. The results from these experiments are shown in Figure 3\n. Significantly, complete deletion of the proposed pseudoknot region (construct 3\u2032del) leads to a fourfold reduction of frameshift efficiency, demonstrating the presence of a 3\u2032 RNA stimulator.",

In the case of loop 1, it even leads to increased frameshifting (to 16.8%). By contrast, replacing the 3\u2032 region of either stem 1 or stem 2 of the pseudoknot with their complementary sequences leads to the same reduction of frameshifting efficiency as seen with the construct missing the entire sequence 3\u2032 of the frameshift site (Figure 3 stem1,3\u2032-mut1; stem2,3\u2032-mut1). Though not without precedent in other 3\u2032 frameshifting pseudoknots, making complementary changes to the original stem disruptions leads to only partial restoration of wild-type frameshifting (Figure 3 stem1,3\u2032-comp; stem2,3\u2032-comp). To further investigate this finding, additional stem-disrupting mutations were made, introducing smaller reciprocal changes, which were then tested separately. Alternatively, two reciprocal (complementary) changes together comprising four separate sets were made. In one case, construct stm1,5\u2032-mut4, the changes introduced are naturally occurring variations in the 5\u2032 region of stem 1 inferred from the phylogenetic analysis, though they do not occur naturally in the combination used here. When all eight unilateral (non-complementary) mutations were tested for their effect on +1 frameshifting, the one with the naturally occurring changes was the only one that caused a minimal reduction in frameshifting. This result can be explained by the fact that three of the four individual nucleotides in the construct do not disrupt base-pairing but change C-G base-pairs to U-G. The other seven unilateral constructs, stm1,5\u2032-mut2, stm1,3\u2032-mut2, stm1,5\u2032-mut3, stm1,3\u2032-mut3, stm1,3\u2032-mut4, stm2,5\u2032-mut2, and stm2,3\u2032-mut2, support much reduced frameshifting comparable to a complete 3\u2032 deletion (3\u2032del). Three of the four bilateral (complementary) constructs, stm1-mut2-comp, stm2-mut2-comp and stm1-mut4-comp,\u2014the latter incorporates the naturally occurring changes in stem 1, show only minimal restoration relative to wild-type. The construct stm1-mut3-comp, in which three nucleotides near the top of stem 1 were swapped, shows a significant restoration of frameshifting activity, though the level achieved is less than that of wild-type.",

As shown above, increasing the spacing in the oyster cassette to five nucleotides has little effect on the level of shifting. Replacement of the oyster antizyme pseudoknot with the IBV pseudoknot leads to a level of frameshifting (3.8%, data not shown) that is essentially the same as having no 3\u2032 stimulator at all (3.4% compared to 13.5% for wild-type), i.e. the IBV pseudoknot does not stimulate +1 frameshifting in the oyster antizyme context. A reciprocal attempt was made to test if the oyster antizyme pseudoknot is capable of simulating \u22121 frameshifting on the IBV frameshift site. First, the minimum wild-type sequence of IBV necessary for efficient frameshifting was inserted into the dual luciferase vector. The spacing between the frameshift site and the pseudoknot in this construct is six nucleotides. Two companion constructs were made. One is an in-frame control and in the second, the U-UUA-AAC frameshift site is altered to U-UUA-UAC to simulate a negative control: \u22121 frameshifting with the wild-type IBV sequence was 4.0% (the same result was obtained with multiple constructs; data not shown), which is significantly less than previously reported by others in both reticulocyte lysates and in transfection experiments (see Discussion). Importantly, frameshifting was essentially abolished, down to 0.6% (which is the same as background in this vector), in the construct with altered frameshift site. A hybrid construct, IBV-AZPK, was made combining the IBV frameshift site fused to an appropriately spaced oyster antizyme pseudoknot (Figure 3). In this hybrid, the pseudoknot starts five nucleotides 3\u2032 of the shift site. This sequence supports a \u22121 frameshifting level of 7.5%, which is almost twofold higher than that with the wild-type IBV pseudoknot. The length of the spacer in the hybrid separating the frameshift site from the RNA pseudoknot was changed by either deleting (construct IBV-AZPK \u03943), or inserting (construct IBV-AZPK +3), three nucleotides, as was done in the original work on the IBV pseudoknot.22 When the distance was shortened to two nucleotides, frameshifting was effectively abolished (down to 0.4%). When the distance was increased by three nucleotides, frameshifting was reduced to 3.6%, which, however, is still comparable to the 4.0% frameshifting with the wild-type IBV sequence.",

Plants are not known to have antizyme genes. On the basis of this and other information, we concluded that this clone is most likely a contaminant from the animal kingdom. While this manuscript was in preparation, the general identity of this animal was revealed when a nearly identical sequence was found in Toxoptera citricida (a citrus aphid). The sequence 3\u2032 of the frameshift site of this aphid antizyme can be folded into a putative RNA pseudoknot, the structure of which is shown in Figure 2(C). Stem 1 of this putative pseudoknot is nearly identical with stem 1 in the newly discovered RNA pseudoknot in oyster antizyme. The sequence of stem 2 is less similar. More significantly, other components of the pseudoknot are also different. In particular, there are four bases between what appears to be the boundaries between stem 1 and stem 2, three more than in any other antizyme pseudoknot previously identified. Loops 1 and 2 are also longer than usual. To test if the second stem of this putative aphid pseudoknot is functional, two constructs were made and tested as above. Both constructs have 5\u2032 sequence, as far as the ORF1 stop codon, identical with that of the constructs described above. However, they differed in the sequence 3\u2032 of the frameshift site. One included the 86 nucleotide wild-type sequence 3\u2032 of the frameshift site of P. tremula antizyme mRNA. The second introduces an inversion in the 3\u2032 half of the putative stem 2, resulting in complete non-complementarity in the same region. Although frameshifting with the wild-type 3\u2032 sequence of P. tremula antizyme mRNA is significantly less than with the 3\u2032 sequence of C. gigas (4.3% versus 13.5%), introducing the mutation in the putative stem 2 of the aphid pseudoknot results in significant reduction in frameshifting (from 4.3% to 1.7% or 2.5 fold reduction, data not shown).",

This feature is present in the invertebrate pseudoknots reported here. Expression of mammalian antizyme 1 mRNAs in reticulocyte lysates showed that extending the spacing between the shift site and the pseudoknot by 3 or 6 nt decreased the efficiency of frameshifting to 77% and 56% of wild-type, respectively.16 At least as judged by this in vitro experiment, where the pseudoknot effect is not as great as in cells, the pseudoknot does not have a direct effect in positioning the shift site within the ribosome, which has been suggested as one possible mechanism of pseudoknot stimulation of frameshifting. Consistent with this, moving the oyster pseudoknot 3 or 6 nt further 3\u2032 had modest and graduated effect on frameshift levels, 87% and 50% of wild-type, respectively, at least as assayed in transfected mammalian cells. This is remarkably similar to the results obtained with the mammalian antizyme 1 gene mentioned above, again negating a direct effect in positioning the shift site within the ribosome. Interestingly, when the same pseudoknot was tested for its ability to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting on an IBV shift sequence, reducing the spacing to 2 nt completely abolished frameshifting, very similar to the result with endogenous IBV pseudoknot.22 (Spacing effects have been described in other cases of frameshifting.22., 23., 24., 25., 26.)",

In contrast, the corresponding region of the known equivalent pseudoknots that function to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting, especially those in IBV and SRV-1 mRNAs26., 27. and the most efficient retroviral shift sites, namely the gag-pro rather than pro-pol sites, tend to be G-rich. However, there was little effect of swapping the sides of stem 1 in IBV,28 or in HTLV-2, provided the full stem was inverted29 and only a 50% effect in the case of equine infectious anaemia virus, a lentivirus.30 So, it is not obvious that this distinction is significant. Of importance, however, is their shared property of having a strongly paired bottom part of stem 1. Consistent with this, increasing the GC content of stem 1 of a pseudoknot, that did not evolve to support frameshifting and that does so only very weakly, made it a much better frameshifting stimulator.31 The relevance of strong pairing at the start of stem 1 for stimulation of frameshifting may be augmented by a loop 2 strand being in close vicinity and influencing strand unwinding.32., 33. Earlier in vitro results with the rat antizyme 1 pseudoknot have shown that changes in any number of nucleotides in either stem do not significantly reduce frameshifting efficiency so long as compensatory changes are made on the opposite side.16 By contrast, none of the six sets of compensated stem alterations of the oyster pseudoknot resulted in wild-type levels of frameshifting. Only one, which swaps three G-C base-pairs near the top of stem 1, comes close, at 79% of wild-type. These results set apart the antizyme pseudoknots in vertebrate and invertebrates, and indicate that in the oyster class pseudoknots what is important for function is the base-pairing in stem 1 and 2, and at least some of the nucleotide identities; perhaps for some currently unknown intra- or intermolecular interaction. In either case, such a result suggests that the antizyme mRNA pseudoknots in vertebrates and invertebrates function somewhat differently in exerting their effects on the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting.",

An important property of stem 1 of the IBV frameshifter pseudoknot is that it is at least 11 nt long.26 Topology is likely to be the key characteristic. Shorter stems 1, predicted to have equal or higher, thermodynamic stability are unable to stimulate frameshifting. In addition, while the ribosome pausing caused by natural frameshift stimulatory pseudoknots may well be important for switching to an alternative frame, certain other pseudoknots or stem\u2013loops that cause an equal pause, do not stimulate frameshifting.34 Stem 1 of the oyster and related invertebrate antizyme pseudoknots, has 11 or 12 uninterrupted Watson\u2013Crick pairs, whereas stem 1 of vertebrate antizyme 1 and 2 pseudoknots has at least one apparent A.C mismatch in its center. A stem 1 of 11 or 12 bases is equal to or more than, the minimal of 11 for one turn of an A-form helix. This feature is not sufficient by itself to account for the +1 frameshifting properties of the oyster pseudoknot, as the coronavirial IBV pseudoknot, which also has 11 bp in stem 1 is unable to stimulate +1 ribosomal frameshifting in the oyster antizyme mRNA context. However, the oyster antizyme pseudoknot is able to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting on the IBV slippery sequence perhaps even better than the IBV pseudoknot itself (at least with the cell type and vector used in our analysis). The reason for the anomalously lower level of IBV frameshifting in the present study is being investigated. This result suggests the possibility that the oyster antizyme +1 pseudoknot has all the features necessary for stimulation of \u22121 frameshifting, although those features on their own are not sufficient for stimulation of +1 shifting, since the IBV pseudoknot obviously lacks them.",

Loop 1 of the oyster and related pseudoknots is much larger (15\u201322 nt) than its vertebrate counterpart, which in turn is larger than that of several \u22121 frameshifter pseudoknots e.g. IBV, Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) gag-pro and Simian Retrovirus-1, but not that of others e.g. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) gag-pol.38 The oyster loop 1 may have internal structure but if so, its form is not important for frameshift stimulation, since inverting its sequence leads to no reduction in frameshifting efficiency. The same appears to be the case with loop 2 of the pseudoknot.",

Removal of the wedge base substantially reduces frameshifting39., 40., 41. and the change is also destabilizing.31., 33., 42. This class of frameshifter pseudoknots, and constructed mimics, has short loops that are important for its bent conformation.43 In contrast, there is no wedge base between the stems of the IBV pseudoknot that features the long stem 1. However, the oyster and other related pseudoknots described here do have a potential wedged nucleotide between stems 1 and 2. In all species where we have identified this pseudoknot, the identity of this wedge nucleotide is adenosine. Changing it to cytosine leads to severe reduction in frameshifting. This is in contrast to the antizyme pseudoknots in vertebrates. Though these pseudoknots almost always have a potential wedged A at the corresponding position, the A can, nevertheless, be changed to any other nucleotide, including C, without significantly reducing effectiveness for frameshifting in vitro.16 The significance of the distinction is not clear but it suggests that the seeming homology of the potential wedged A bases might be misleading, and the two classes of antizyme pseudoknots may behave differently.",

The evidence supporting the great evolutionary distance among the antizyme genes with the newly discovered pseudoknot includes the distant relationship of their antizyme protein sequence as well as the accumulation of large number of nucleotide variations in the loop regions of the antizyme mRNA pseudoknot. According to the current \u201ctree of life\u201d,44 the last common ancestor of the six organisms that have an antizyme pseudoknot homologous to that in oyster lived very early in the Bilateria lineage (possibly in the last common ancestor of extant Bilateria), before the radiation that lead to Acoelomorphs (planaria, Dugesia japonica), Ecdyozoa (nematodes, Trichinella spiralis; arthropods, Amblyomma variegatum) and Lophotrochozoa (annelids, Lumbricus rubellus; bivalves, C. gigas and Argopecten irradians). Barring horizontal gene transfer (and we can find no evidence in this case), these observations argue in favor of a very ancient origin of the newly identified antizyme mRNA pseudoknot, more than 550 million years ago. In contrast, the previously known antizyme pseudoknot is present only in vertebrates (but not in lower chordates) and is thus no older that 510 million years and perhaps as recent as 410 million years. If, as currently believed, Acelomorphs are the most divergent branch of Bilateria, the common ancestor of many other higher eukaryotes, e.g. nematodes, insects and vertebrates, contained this type of antizyme pseudoknot stimulator. However, many of the branches have since lost it. What was happening as this was occurring is obscure, but identification of the putative stimulators in descendent species will likely be informative. At least for vertebrates, the identity of its (ultimate) replacement is known to be a different type of pseudoknot.11., 14.\n",

Current evidence suggests that there is more than one 5\u2032 stimulatory element in at least some of the antizyme mRNAs. An argument has been made that the 5\u2032 stimulator in vertebrates is modular and comprised of at least three distinct elements with different evolutionary history.14 On the basis of sequence comparison, the antizyme mRNAs containing the newly discovered oyster class pseudoknots have the two modules proximal to the frameshift site. The sequence of the third more distant module is less conserved among them. Deletion of just 9 nt of what should be the middle 5\u2032 stimulatory module of oyster antizyme mRNA leads to nearly eightfold reduction of frameshifting in mammalian cells. This is a significantly greater reduction than when the same region is deleted from mammalian antizyme mRNA and assayed for frameshifting in vitro in reticulocyte lysates.16 Perhaps this particular segment of the 5\u2032 stimulator is more important for the frameshifting of the oyster antizyme, at least when assayed in mammalian cells. In any case, this experiment clearly demonstrates that a 5\u2032 frameshift stimulator is indeed present in oyster antizyme. The 5\u2032 stimulator of mammalian antizyme 1, at least when tested in a heterologous system, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, appears to work through its primary nucleotide sequence rather than through the sequence of the nascent peptide encoded by it.45 However, how it actually exerts its potential is less clear. Mostly likely, it somehow interacts with a component, perhaps rRNA, of translating ribosomes.",

Transfected cells were lysed in 12.5 \u03bcl of lysis buffer and light emission was measured following injection of 50 \u03bcl of luminescence buffer. Frameshifting (and readthrough) efficiency was calculated as described,18 by comparing firefly to renilla luciferase ratios of experimental constructs to those of control (in-frame) constructs. Two control constructs were made by deleting the U from the UGA stop codon of ORF1, one corresponding to the wild-type oyster sequence (i.e. WT-construct in Figure 3) the other to the oyster 3\u2032 deletion construct (i.e. construct del3\u2032 in Figure 3). Since both produced identical ratios of firefly to renilla luciferase activities only one, that corresponding to WT, was used for all data presented here.",
