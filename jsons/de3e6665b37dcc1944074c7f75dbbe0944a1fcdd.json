In this context, cost-effective, sustainable, and eco-friendly polymeric materials derived from renewable resources that can replace those based on petroleum feedstock are being sought. Even after the recent expansion of renewable polymers, the small contribution of renewable polymers in the commercial market is mostly due to their elevated cost and poorer performance compared with synthetic polymers produced from petroleum chemicals [1] . The leading challenge for the biorenewable industry is to prepare materials with properties that counterpart those of petroleum-based ones so that they can compete or even surpass the chemicals now in use. The most-employed renewable resources are plant oils, polysaccharides, and proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 643, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Vegetable or plant oils constitute a renewable resource that can be used as starting material for polymers due to their abundant availability, relatively low cost, biodegradability, and environmental friendship [2] . The major constituents of plant oils are triglycerides, which are the product of esterification of glycerol with three fatty acids. Fatty acids account for 95% of the total weight of triglycerides, and their composition varies depending on the plant, crop, season, growing conditions, and purification methods [3] , and their properties are conditioned by the stereochemistry of the double bonds, the degree of unsaturation and the length of fatty acids. The chemical structures of the most common fatty acids of vegetable oils are depicted in Fig. 19 .1. Linseed, sunflower, castor, soybean, oiticica, palm, tall, olive, cottonseed, jatropha, and rapeseed oils are most commonly used for the synthesis of biopolymers [4, 5] and have found practical applications as biodiesel, lubricants, cutting fluids, coatings surfactants, soaps, cosmetic products, and so forth. A number of derivatives of vegetable oils have been employed as polymerizable monomers in radiation-curable systems to provide flexible and tough resins like epoxy, urethane, and polyester [6] . Amine-cured combinations of epoxidized soybean oil and conventional epoxy resins, acrylated soybean oil copolymerized with styrene and divinylbenzene, and polyurethane resins prepared from polyols derived from castor oil have been widely used to prepare composite materials with excellent mechanical and barrier properties [7] . Further, epoxidized vegetable oils (EVO) such as soybean and palm have been used in UV-curable coating systems [5, 6] . While the use of vegetable oils in paints and coatings is decades old, nowadays emphasis is being made on this type of materials to bring in new properties, improved performance coupled with environment friendliness at affordable costs [8] . It is expected that vegetable oilebased coating will compete in the next future with their petro-based counterparts in performance and applications and may establish themselves as \"greener\" precursors to environment friendly coatings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 214, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 527, "end": 530, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 935, "end": 938, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 939, "end": 941, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1276, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1602, "end": 1605, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1722, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1725, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1967, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 761, "end": 768, "text": "Fig. 19", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Linseed oil (LO), also known as flaxseed oil or flax oil, is a colorless to yellowish oil obtained from the dried, ripened seeds of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum L.), widely cultivated in Europe for selected industrial applications, specifically oils and fibers [9] . This oil is beneficial for the human body and can prevent heart attack since it is the richest source of a-linolenic acid. It also contains lignans that may have antioxidant actions and aid to protect against certain cancers. In addition, it helps to prevent elevated blood pressure by inhibiting inflammatory reactions that cause arteryhardening plaque and poor circulation. About 70% of all the LO produced worldwide is intended for technical applications, and the rest is for food production. Its typical fatty acid composition is shown in Fig. 19 .2. The low cost, sustainability, availability, and ease of handling of LO make it attractive as an alternative to petroleum-based plastics. Consequently, it has previously been employed as raw material for the synthesis of biopolymers [10] as well as in paints and coatings, and it is starting to be used in agriculture, food packaging, and biomedicine. In this regard, the antibacterial activity of LO against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Candida albicans has been recently reported [11] . Polymers derived from vegetable oils exhibit poor mechanical and barrier properties, which limit their practical applications [1] . In particular, their brittleness, high gas and vapor permeability, low heat distortion temperature, and poor resistance to prolonged processing operations have restricted their industrial uses. To overcome these shortcomings, with a view to expand their range of commercial uses, new approaches are required such as blending with other polymers [12] or filling with nanofillers [13e16].

Anatase TiO 2 has a tetragonal structure ( Fig. 19 .3A) and encloses six atoms per unit cell, albeit the TiO 6 octahedron is distorted. The anatase phase predominates at 0 K; this structure is ideal for solar cell applications due to higher electron mobility, higher specific area, lower dielectric constant, and density. Rutile TiO 2 also has a tetragonal structure ( Fig. 19 .3B) and the octahedron is less distorted. It is stable at most temperatures and pressures up to 60 kbar. Anatase and brookite structures transform to the rutile phase for particle sizes >14 nm. It is mainly used as white pigment in paint.

A variety of synthesis methods such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, solegel, direct oxidation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrodeposition, sonochemical, mechanochemical, and microwave method have been used for the preparation of TiO 2 nanostructures [29] . Among them, the most employed are the solegel and the hydrothermal method. The former process involves conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution (sol) that acts as the precursor for the discrete particles. This process normally proceeds via an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis step of titanium (IV) alkoxide followed by condensation. The latter does not necessitate the use of organic solvents or further processing of the product (grinding and calcination), which makes it a straightforward and environmentally friendly technique. The synthesis occurs in an autoclave, where the mixture of substrates is heated steadily to a temperature of 100e300 C and is kept for several days. This process leads to products of high degree of crystallinity and high purity. The mechanochemical process is an inexpensive and easy method of obtaining TiO 2 nanoparticles on a large scale [30] . It employs titanyl sulfate (TiOSO 4 $xH 2 SO 4 $yH 2 O) as starting material and requires high-energy dry milling that starts a reaction through ballepowder impact in a ball mill at low temperature. A \"thinner\" is added to the system in the form of a solid (usually NaCl), which acts as a reaction medium and separates the nanoparticles being formed. The advantages of this technique are the high homogeneity of the crystalline structure and morphology, low production costs, small particle sizes, and restricted tendency of the particles to agglomerate. A shortcoming of this method is that it requires long milling times to attain a uniform grinding of the powder, which leads to a greater amount of impurities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1258, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Synthesis"}, {"text": "In the sonochemical method, a solution of the precursor (typically tetraisopropyl titanate) in NaOH is exposed to ultrasound for several minutes (c. 30) under ambient conditions.

They are semiconductors with a structurally dependent band gap (anatased3.20 eV and rutiled3.03 eV), widely used for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications. In particular, they are very effective in photocatalytic water splitting and have been employed as active layers in photovoltaics as well as electrodes in photoelectrolysis cells where they have been shown to enhance the efficiency of electrolytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen [33] . These environmentally friendly materials also display intense UV absorption, large volume to area ratio, high catalytic activity, highly crystalline structure, radiation hardness, density of w4 g/cm 3 , melting point of 2100 K, good mechanical properties including a Young's modulus of 230 GPa and hardness of w10 GPa, low coefficient of thermal expansion (w8.4 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 K \u00c01 at 300 K), low dielectric constant (w10), and high thermal conductivity (w4.8 W/cm K). They also display antimicrobial activity against a large variety of microorganisms, including algae, viruses, protozoa, fungi, and bacteria like Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Lactobacillus acidophilus and E. coli (bacteria), and Chlorella vulgaris (green algae). When TiO 2 is illuminated with UV light, electron (e\u00c0)/hole (h\u00fe) pairs are generated that have strong reducing and oxidizing power. These react with O 2 and H 2 O to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anion radicals (O 2\u00c0 ) and hydroxyl radicals ( OH) (Fig. 19 .4), which are regarded the dominant species contributing to the destruction of microorganism cells [34] . The hydroxyl radical is an extremely aggressive oxidant, and as such, it can attack various biological molecules and impair their proper functioning. Other mechanisms of antibacterial activity have been proposed, including membrane disorganization due to accumulation of TiO 2 nanoparticles in the bacterial membrane and also their cellular internalization (Fig. 19.4) ; bacterial death seems to be caused by a disorder in the cell permeability and decomposition of the cell walls. It has been reported that cell wall damage precedes cytoplasmic membrane damage [36] , thereby leading to leakage of minerals, proteins, and genetic materials, causing cell death. For instance, cell membrane damage took place due to the photocatalytic degradation of endotoxin from E. coli with TiO 2 thin films [36] . Further, it has been demonstrated that the rate of adsorption of cells onto TiO 2 is directly related to its bactericidal effect [37] . Adsorption of cells onto aggregated TiO 2 , followed by loss of membrane integrity, was the reason of the bactericidal effect.

As can be observed in Fig. 19 .8, both properties also decrease with increasing TiO 2 loading, leading to 21% and 45% reductions compared with AELO, respectively, at the highest nanoparticle content.

Other researchers have also shown positive effects of TiO 2 nanoparticles on WVP of epoxy-based nanocomposites [31] .
