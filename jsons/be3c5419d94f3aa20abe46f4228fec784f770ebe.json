Positional cloning of the locus in question has revealed that susceptibility of laboratory inbred strains to this class of virus is associated with a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the OAS1B isoform. Analysis of the molecular structure of the cluster in different mammalian species including human indicates that the cluster is extremely polymorphic with a highly variable number of genes and pseudogenes whose functions are not yet completely established. Although still preliminary, a few recent observations also substantiate a possible role for OAS1 in human susceptibility to viral infections (West Nile virus, SARS, etc.) and its possible involvement in some other diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Finally, convergent observations indicate that the molecules encoded by the 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS cluster might be involved in other fundamental cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation, gene regulation, and apoptosis.",

Experiments of that kind, however, are not easy to perform because many parameters interfere with the experimental protocols, often making difficult the unambiguous delineation of \"resistant\" and \"susceptible\" phenotypes in a population of experimentally infected animals. In most cases, resistance or susceptibility to a pathogen depends on the complex interactions of multiple genes that control the host response. In a few cases, however, the situation is greatly simplified by the observation of clear-cut phenotypic differences between various inbred strains of laboratory mice after experimental infection. In this review we describe the historical case of genetic resistance to flaviviruses, the experiments that led to its elucidation at the molecular level, and the consequences of these discoveries.",

Many individuals exhibit flavivirus-specific antibodies, suggesting that infections by these viruses are mild or even unapparent, and revealing that some degree of adaptation has occurred between the virus and its host. In some other cases, however, flaviviruses can cause epidemic outbreaks in humans, and infected patients may exhibit a wide range of symptoms ranging from transient febrile illness to life-threatening hemorrhagic fevers (dengue and yellow fever) and meningo-encephalitis syndromes [Japanese encephalitis and West Nile (WN) fever]. The reasons why some flaviviruses cause severe clinical manifestations only in a small percentage of infected individuals are probably numerous and accordingly they have not yet been completely elucidated, but recurrent epidemiological observations and recent scientific data indicate that host-dependent genetic factors might be important.",

By and large, one can consider that all laboratory inbred strains of mice that have been tested so far, with the exception of strain PL/J, are susceptible to experimental infections while most wild mice or mice from inbred strains recently derived from wild progenitors are resistant. To mention just one example of this difference in susceptibility, we reported that a single intra-peritoneal inoculation, equivalent to 100 times the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) of the WN virus (strain IS-98-ST1), administered to adult mice of the classical laboratory inbred strains BALB/c or C57BL/6 was lethal for all the animals 9.5\u00b11.5 days after inoculation, while mice from unrelated inbred strains recently derived from wild ancestors of either the Mus musculus domesticus (WMP/Pas), Mus m. musculus (MAI/Pas, MBT/Pas, PWK/Pas), or Mus spretus (SEG/Pas, STF/Pas) species were totally resistant to the same treatment (Mashimo et al. 2002) . During this experiment, infectious particles of WN virus could be detected in the brain of all infected mice after 5 days of infection, and the amounts of virus peaked at 10 9 focus forming units (FFU)/g of brain tissue by day 7 (Mashimo et al. 2002) . High levels of anti-WN antibody could also be detected in surviving animals, indicating that the virus replicated in resistant strains. This experiment was just one of many experiments of the same kind performed over the past 40 years with a variety of flaviviruses, using several routes of inoculation and several doses and strains of virus. All these experiments yielded similar results, confirming that the phenotype of resistance/susceptibility is not WNspecific but, on the contrary, extends to other types of flaviviruses as well.",

Most classical laboratory inbred strains are homozygous for the Flv s allele. A third allele leading to \"minor resistance\" ( Flv mr ) has also been found segregating in wild mice of the M. m. molossinus subspecies [for historical details on the discovery and genetics of the Flv locus, readers may refer to Brinton and Perelygin (2003) ]. Congenic \"resistant\" strains have been produced by back-crossing for several generations the successive resistant offspring of an initial cross between resistant wild mice (any species) with a \"susceptible\" laboratory inbred strain. This classical breeding strategy allowed, at the same time, refinement of the genetic localization of the Flv locus on mouse Chr 5 and allowed the production of unlimited populations of \"resistant\" and \"susceptible\" mice with an otherwise similar genetic constitution, a very helpful material for experimentation.",

Readers who may be interested in reading our publication about the positional cloning of Flv (Mashimo et al. 2002) , must know that, since we had no evidence that the gene we were cloning was identical to Flv itself, we provisionally gave it another name ( Wnv for WN virus-with two alleles Wnv r and Wnv s ) even though we had little doubt that the two genes were presumably one-and-the-same entity. We now have molecular proof of this identity. . A first difficulty in this project arose when we found that, among the offspring of an intersubspecific backcross of the type (BALB/ c\u00d7MBT/Pas)F1\u00d7BALB/c, which we expected to be a mixed population with 50% of the individuals being Flv r / Flv s and the other 50% being Flv s / Flv s , all mice heterozygous for Flv r survived while not all mice with a Flv s / Flv s genetic constitution died as we would have expected. This is a good illustration of a major pitfall in this kind of experiment, where it is always risky or even impossible to trust in a \"dead-or-alive\" phenotype after an experimental infection, even if the latter is performed in the same highly standardized conditions. To bypass this difficulty and be able to achieve a high-resolution genetic mapping of the Flv locus, an absolutely necessary step in the positional cloning process, we derived a set of subcongenic mice by selecting, with the help of microsatellite markers, those offspring where a crossover event occurred that reduced the critical genetic interval containing the Flv locus. Offspring from these mice (all of the same genetic constitution) were challenged with a standardized dose of virus and finally classified as \"resistant\" or \"susceptible.\" This rather tedious procedure allowed us to localize, with a very high degree of confidence, the Flv locus within an interval flanked by markers D5Mit408 and D5Mit242 , which is roughly equivalent to 300 kb of DNA (Fig. 1 ).",

These recombinant mice were then mated with either BALB/c or C57BL/6 susceptible partners, and around 30/50 progenies of these crosses were challenged with West Nile virus and classified as \"susceptible\" or \"resistant.\" This protocol, because it involves a rather large sample of animals with exactly the same genotype, is highly reliable for the purpose phenotyping based on a dead-or-alive phenotype This genetic interval contains about 30 genes whose sequence and expression pattern are well known (Fig. 2 ). Among these genes, the cluster encoding the interferon inducible oligoadenylate synthetases ( Oas1 , Oas2, Oas3 etc.) appeared top-ranked in the list of candidates for reasons that will be explained later. We then decided to have a more careful look at the sequence of these genes in both \"resistant\" and \"susceptible\" mice. We observed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the different strains or species studied, a finding that was not surprising considering the polyphyletic origins of the laboratory inbred strains of mice (Wade et al. 2002) . We found it remarkable, however, that in one of the elements of the cluster, namely the Oas1b gene, all susceptible mice had a T \u2192 C transition in the fourth exon of this gene, replacing an arginine residue with a premature stop codon. The perfect and absolute correlation between susceptibility to viral infection and the occurrence of a stop codon was observed independently in two laboratories (Mashimo et al. 2002; Perelygin et al. 2002) and supported the hypothesis that a truncated, and presumably inactive form of 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS is indeed causative of the innate susceptibility to flavivirus infection. The presence of a stop codon is also compatible with susceptibility behaving as a fully recessive trait and fits perfectly with one of the known functions of the interferon inducible enzyme 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS. In addition to this absolute phenotype/genotype correlation, it has also been reported that a flavivirus-resistant phenotype could be restored in a susceptible mouse strain by replacing the 3\u00b4 portion of the susceptible Oas1b sequence in 129/SvJ/RW4 ES cells, by homologous recombination with a 129/SvJ/ RW4 DNA sequence containing four substitutions characteristic of the Oas1b resistance allele, in particular a reversion from TGA to CGA (Scherbik et al. 2007 ).",

These three genes share the same order of transcription and are arranged on the chromosome in the following order: centromere 5\u00b4-OAS1 -OAS3 -OAS2 -3\u00b4 (Hovanessian and Justesen 2007) . The size of these genes is relatively short (~12 kb for OAS1 ; ~36 kb for both OAS2 and OAS3 ) and analysis of their sequence reveals the presence of a conserved domain of five exons (the first 346-amino acid residues of OAS1 ), designated , Oas3 , and the eight genes in the Oas1 cluster are obvious. From the knowledge we have of their function, they appear as top-ranked candidates in the determinism of susceptibility to flaviviruses the 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS unit, with one copy in OAS1 , two copies in OAS2 , and three copies in OAS3 . This organization and sequence homology suggest that the OAS1 gene is probably the ancestral gene, the other two genes being derived after duplication or triplication of this ancestral gene. The promoter region of the three genes contains an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), which is consistent with the fact that most of the 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS proteins are interferon (IFN)-inducible enzymes. OAS1 is transcribed in four isoforms of 42, 44, 46, and 48 kDa respectively, depending on alternative splicing of exons 5 and 6. These isoforms, which have identical aminotermini but different carboxyl-termini, may have different functions. Formation of a human OAS1 tetramer is essential for the catalytic activity of the protein (Torshin 2005) . OAS2 is also spliced in two isoforms of 69 and 71 kDa that share a common amino-terminus of 683 residues, with extensions of 4 and 44 amino acids, respectively. OAS3 encodes a unique protein of 100 kDa (Hovanessian and Justesen 2007; Justesen et al. 2000; Rebouillat and Hovanessian 1999; Fig. 3 ) .",

            "text": "Aside from OAS1 , OAS2 , and OAS3 , another gene-identified by screening a cDNA expression library with anti-OAS3 polyclonal antibodies ) and by screening an EST library (Hartmann et al. 1998 )-with a sequence similar to the one of OAS1 , although somewhat bigger, was discovered. This gene encodes a 56-kDa protein that differs from the other OAS proteins by an approx. 160-amino acid extension at its C-terminus, which has homology to the interferon-inducible protein ISG15 and also has a tandem repeat of two ubiquitin-like domains (Hartmann et al. 1998 ). This protein is devoid of 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS activity and accordingly was named OASL for \"OAS like\" protein. The human OASL gene exhibits a high degree of homology with the chicken OAS gene, but the latter encodes a highly active 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS (Torshin 2005) . [Sarker et al. 1998 , Rebouillat et al. 1999 , Justesen et al. 2000 The mouse Oas cluster is the second most well known after human. It contains one Oas2 and one Oas3 gene, and ten Oas1 genes (or pseudogenes?) designated Oas1a to Oas1j (Eskildsen et al. 2002; Kakuta et al. 2002; Mashimo et al. 2003; Perelygin et al. 2006; Figs. 2 and 3) . These 12 genes are arranged in tandem within a stretch of DNA that spans approximately 230 kb of mouse Chr 5. The segment harboring the Oas cluster (and a few other flanking genes) is inverted when compared to the human configuration . Mouse Oas2/Oas3 genes have a genomic structure very similar to the one of human, and a very similar pattern of transcription even if the transcription products are somewhat bigger in the mouse (725 and 742 amino acids compared to 687 and 727 for OAS2; 1,138 amino acids compared to 1,087 for OAS3). Here again, based on their sequences and orientation, one can guess that these 12 genes result from the duplication, in several steps, of an ancestral copy after divergence of the primates and rodents phyla. RT-PCR performed with a set of specific primers on RNA extracted from several adult and fetal tissues, either before or after induction with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), indicated that nine genes of the Oas1 family ( Oas1a to Oas1i ) are transcribed and some variations can be observed in the different patterns of expression. According to Mashimo and coworkers (2003) each of the nine Oas1 genes exhibits a unique battery of transcriptional regulatory elements, suggesting that each of these units has the potential to be differentially regulated. So far only Oas1a has been found to be alternatively spliced yielding two transcripts each including different parts of exon 6 ( Kakuta et al. 2002; Mashimo et al. 2003 ; Fig. 3 ). Two genes, homologous to the human OASL , have also been identified in the mouse: Oasl1 and Oasl2 . Analysis of their structure indicates that they are probably nonfunctional pseudogenes.",

Four OAS genes ( OAS1X , OAS1Y , OAS1Z , and OAS2 ) plus a single copy of OASL1 were detected in the cow genome. The cluster in the pig genome is similar to the OAS cluster of cattle although OAS1Z is absent. Remarkably, the orthologous copy of mouse/human OAS3 is not found in either the pig or the cow genomes. The dog and horse clusters are also similar and are more like the human cluster than either the mouse or rat clusters. Dog and horse have three copies of the Fig. 3 b (continued) Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences for the proteins encoded by the eight Oas1 genes indicates that Oas1c , Oas1d , Oas1e , Oas1f , and Oas1h are structurally similar and lack several functional domains. These observations suggest that these isoforms may actually be inactive pseudogenes rather than real isoforms. In contrast, Oas1g and Oas1a encode proteins that could be functional in the 2\u00b4,5\u00b4OAS/RNase L cascade. Note that for both a and b the scale for exons is five times larger than for introns human/mouse OAS3 ortholog ( OAS3C , OAS3M , and OAS3N ) , two copies of OAS2 (OAS2N and OAS2C ) and a single copy of the human OAS1 ortholog.

Two tandemly duplicated OAS-like ( OASL ) genes were identified in the dog genome but only a single OASL ortholog was found in both the cattle and the pig genomes. The bovine and porcine OASL genes contain premature stop codons and encode truncated proteins, which lack the typical C-terminal double ubiquitin-like domains. Evidence of concerted evolution of all these paralogous 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS genes was obtained in rodents ( Rodentia ) and even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla ) (Perelygin et al. 2006 ).",

These enzymes are activated by binding to double-stranded RNA, and their products, the 2\u00b4-5\u00b4 oligoadenylates, activate the latent endoribonuclease RNase L that finally degrades viral or cellular RNA molecules (Hovanessian and Justesen 2007) . This is how the antiviral activity of these enzymes is generally explained. Several experiments have confirmed this crucial function in the innate, antiflavivirus mechanism of defense in the mouse (Kajaste-Rudnitski et al. 2006; Lucas et al. 2003) although some experiments suggest that RNase L activation is not a major component of the OAS1B-mediated flavivirus resistance phenotype .",

In the mouse, interferon is also an inducer of the different OAS molecules, and alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences for the proteins encoded by Oas1c , Oas1d , Oas1e , Oas1f , Oas1h , Oas1i , and Oas1j -although structurally very similar-lack some essential functional domains, such as the LXXXPA motif (Ghosh et al. 1997) , the highly conserved aspartic acid residues in exon 2 (Sarkar et al. 1999) , and the CFK motif (Ghosh et al. 1997) . These observations suggest that, although these isoforms have retained their binding activity to dsRNA, they have lost their Mg 2+ -dependent catalytic activity and accordingly are most probably inactive pseudogenes rather than genes encoding a protein with 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS activity (Sarkar et al. 1999; Shibata et al. 2001 ). Another possibility that should be kept in mind would be that these isoforms, encoded in the above-mentioned genes, have acquired other functions. The three genes, Oas1g , Oas1a , and of course Oas1b , encode proteins that have been proved (or are likely) to be functional in the 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS/RNase L cascade.",

These experiments indicated that viral replication is less efficient in cells that produce the normal copy of OAS1B than in those expressing the mutant form of the protein .

In human and other mammalian species, however, the role of 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS in viral pathogenesis is much less clear. According to Perelygin and colleagues, the flavivirusspecific activity of the mouse OAS1B isoform on flaviviral replication might be correlated with a 4-amino acid deletion in the P-loop motif that is unique to this isoform and does not appear to exist in human (Perelygin et al. 2002) . This 4-amino acid deletion (12 bp) might be of special importance for the OAS1B protein to specifically interact with the ATP substrate if one considers recent data from the crystalline structure of the porcine OAS1 enzyme (Hartmann et al. 2003) . Even if this hypothesis is supported by other experiments in vitro (Urosevic et al. 1999) , an alternative explanation for the specific activity of OAS1B on flavivirus replication might be found in its promoter sequence, where several binding sites [for NF-\u03baB, GAS, and interferon (IFN)-stimulated specific response element (ISRE)] exhibit a unique organization. In particular, it is noteworthy that OAS1B is the only gene where the NF-\u03baB and ISRE binding sites are closely associated in tandem, producing a genomic structure that has previously been reported as capable of triggering gene expression upon viral induction (Cheng et al. 1998) . Sequencing the promoter regions of the OAS1B isoform in remotely related mouse species did not provide evidence that some particular structural changes in this promoter might be associated with the phenotype of resistance or susceptibility after flavivirus infection. This supports the hypothesis that the stop codon found in the OAS1B coding sequence of most laboratory strains, which is the only obvious structural difference between susceptible and resistant genotypes, indeed is directly related to this phenotype. The 4amino acid deletion in the P-loop motif has not been found in the orthologous region of the rat OAS1B isoform but does occur in rat OAS1F. The rat, like wild mice, seems to be naturally resistant when naturally infected (Eldadah et al. 1967) .",

The first, by Bonnevie-Nielsen and colleagues, reports a significant correlation between the basal activity of OAS1 and an A/G SNP at the exon 7 splice-acceptor site (AG or AA) of the OAS1 gene . According to these authors, in a cohort of 83 families each containing two parents and two children, allele G had a higher frequency in people with high enzyme activity than in those with low enzyme activity, with the activity being related to this polymorphism in a dose-dependent manner across the GG, GA, and AA genotypes. Allele G generates the p46 enzyme isoform, whereas allele A ablates the splice site and generates a dual-function antiviral/ pro-apoptotic p48 isoform and a novel p52 isoform. The discovery of this genetic polymorphism and of its influence on host susceptibility to flavivirus infections clearly underlines the likely importance of OAS1 in the innate mechanisms of defense.",

It therefore makes sense to guess that the different OAS molecules have cellular functions other than the one made obvious by the accidental discovery of differential flavivirus resistance in the mouse species. In humans, for example, OAS1 , OAS2 , and OAS3 appear to be differentially induced by interferon, induced in different types of cells, and for some of them expressed even in healthy individuals, which is indicative of an eventual role under physiological conditions and not only after infections. They are also characterized by different subcellular locations. Some OAS proteins might have as-yet-unidentified catalytic activities, suggesting that they may have distinct roles in the cell.

Although of importance, making alterations in the coding sequences of these genes in order to assess their function(s) would not necessarily require that the stop codon in Oas1b exon 4 be \"repaired\" in advance. Yan and colleagues, for example, demonstrated that mutant mice lacking OAS1D ( Oas1d \u2212/\u2212 ) displayed reduced fertility due to defects in ovarian follicle development, decreased efficiency of ovulation, and arrest at the one-cell stage of fertilized eggs (Yan et al. 2005) . This was indeed a totally unexpected function for a protein exhibiting a very high degree of similarity with OAS1B.",

Experimental data collected after experiments on mouse flavivirus susceptibility and preliminary observations made in humans suggest that the cluster in question is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis since evolutionary (environmental) forces contribute to its \"shaping\" (Godfrey et al. 2004 ). Since no sequences related to 2\u00b4-5\u00b4OAS genes could be identified in either Caenorhabditis elegans or in Drosophila melanogaster , however, it seems that the OAS cluster is either not absolutely fundamental for cell physiology or that it is replaced by another structure with similar functions in other developed organisms.",
