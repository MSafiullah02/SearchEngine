Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation [12]. The generation of ROS can be induced under various conditions of stress, including ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs and viral infections [13]. ROS not only kill target cells but may also overwhelm cellular antioxidant defenses of neighboring cells, leading to damage of DNA [12]. Meanwhile, ROS have also been implicated in some important signaling pathways, such as MAPK and p53 pathways [14]. In our previous works we have demonstrated that TGEV activates p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathways, causes transcriptional induction of Bax and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol upon TGEV infection [6], [7]. The study presented here demonstrated that TGEV infection could induce ROS accumulation to regulate the apoptotic signalings, which might play primary role in the pathogenesis of TGEV.",

Results showed that the fluorescence in PK-15 cells was observed at 3 h post infection (p.i.), and the fluorescence intensity enhanced with infectious time increase (Fig. 1\nA). To further confirm the ROS production, intracellular ROS production was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, consistent with the observation under fluorescence microscopy, TGEV infection induced an increase in DCF fluorescence (Fig. 1B, upper panel). At 3, 6 and 12 h post-infection, ROS production in TGEV-infected cells increased markedly compared with that of mock-infected cells, and maintained a higher level in next infectious time (Fig. 1B, lower panal). However, UV-inactivated TGEV lost their ability to increase ROS production (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that TGEV induce ROS accumulation in PK-15 cells.",

Fig. 2\nA showed that the \u0394\u03c8m-depolarized cells increased about 26.2% and 61.3% at 12 and 24 h in TGEV infected PK-15 cells, respectively, compared with mock infection. Two different antioxidants of ROS, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC) (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, US), which did not show cytotoxicity at concentrations used (data not shown), significantly prevented the production of ROS and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential in TGEV-infected cells (Fig. 2B and C). These results indicated that TGEV infection might reduce mitochondrial membrane potential through the production of ROS.",

To further explore the roles of ROS accumulation in TGEV-induced apoptosis, we investigated the effects of PDTC and NAC, on the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and cytochrome c redistribution, caspase-3 activity and apoptosis induction. As predicted, the expression of Bcl-2 increased (Fig. 3\nA), Bax and cytochrome c (Cyt c) redistribution was attenuated evidently in mitochondria and cytosol respectively in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells with PDTC- and NAC treatment (Fig. 3B). In addition, caspase-3 activity was remarkably decreased in the TGEV-infected cells with PDTC and NAC compared to that without the two inhibitors (Fig. 3C). Consequently, PDTC and NAC treatment significantly suppressed TGEV-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that ROS play a pivotal role in the process of apoptosis induced by TGEV.",

Apoptosis can be preceded by loss of selective ion permeability, leading to the formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores and the release of apoptosis initiating factors, triggering the activity of caspases [14]. Time course analysis of TGEV infected PK-15 cells showed that with ROS accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential reduced significantly, suggesting that TGEV-induced ROS accumulation lead to outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Mitochondrial oxidative damage can also increase the tendency of mitochondria to release cellular toxic proteins such as cytochrome c (cyt c) to the cytosol and thereby activate the cell\u2019s apoptotic machinery [14], [17]. In the present study, Two ROS scavengers (PDTC and NAC) significantly inhibited TGEV infection-induced Bax redistribution, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis occurrence, suggesting that ROS play a pivotal role in the process of TGEV induction of cell apoptosis.",

In our present works we have demonstrated that about 60% of ROS were produced after p53 signaling was activated in TGEV infected PK-15 cells. Block of p53 activation could significantly attenuate the increase of this part of ROS. These results suggest that ROS accumulation in TGEV-infected cells is predominantly attribute to p53 activation. In addition, inhibition of ROS by NAC and PDTC could partially reduce the activation of p38 MAPK and p53, suggesting that ROS might be an upstream signal molecule involved in the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathways in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. Our results provide a link between the known mediators of apoptosis, p53 and ROS, and indicate the order in the pathway by which these mediators exert their effects ROS downstream to p53. Consistent with this model, ROS production in response to p53 occurred ahead of apoptotic death, indicating that p53-generated ROS may constitute a signal for apoptosis rather than being a consequence of the cellular changes associated with apoptosis.",
