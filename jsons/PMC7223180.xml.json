            "text": "Vibrio harveyi, which occurs naturally in marine habitats (Firmino et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2018), has developed into a significant pathogen of wild and cultured marine fish and invertebrates (notably penaeid shrimp), especially in warm waters of Asia, southern Europe, and South America. However, V. harveyi is not always recovered as a pure culture from diseased animals. Instead, there is some evidence that the pathogen may be recovered in mixed microbial populations, with, for example, V. chagassi (Fabbro et al. 2011). Moreover, V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi, and V. parahaemolyticus were detected in diseased yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) in China; none of the three bacterial pathogens dominated (Liu et al. 2016). Similarly, V. harveyi was recovered with V. alginolyticus from diseased hybrid groupers (Epinephelus polyphekadion \u00d7 E. fuscoguttatus) in Malaysia (Mohamad et al. 2019). Of course, it is uncertain whether the presence of two or more bacterial taxa from the same pathological material represents co-culture or the presence of secondary invaders or even chance contaminants. Unfortunately, this aspect of pathology is rarely investigated. This review strives to discuss the biology of V. harveyi particularly aspects which appertain to its role as a serious pathogen of mariculture.",

            "text": "Vibrio harveyi is a member of the genus Vibrio, in the family Vibrionaceae, order Vibrionales, class Gammaproteobacteria, and phylum Proteobacteria. The classification of the organism has progressed from its initial name of Achromobacter harveyi (E. N. Harvey was a pioneer in the systematics of bioluminescence; Johnson and Shunk 1936) to Lucibacterium harveyi and Beneckea harveyi to the currently accepted name, V. harveyi (Farmer et al. 2005). Identification of isolates has progressed from phenotypic, serologic to genotypic or polyphasic, including the use of DNA:DNA hybridization when Ishimaru and Muroga (1997) confirmed that pathogenic isolates from milkfish (Chanos chanos) in Japan were definitely V. harveyi. A brief phenotypic description mentions that V. harveyi comprises Gram-negative, fermentative rod-shaped bacteria, which require for sodium chloride for growth and are motile by polar flagella (Fig. 1a, b). Growth occurs on TCBS (cholera agar = thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar) (Fig. 1c; Farmer et al. 2005). Some cultures are luminous (Fig. 1d). However, the phenotype may be changed by infection with the Vibrio harveyi myovirus like bacteriophage (VHML) (Vidgen et al. 2006). By 16S rRNA gene or whole-genome sequencing, V. harveyi is clearly a core species of Vibrio (Dorsch et al. 1992; Lin et al. 2018).",

However, multilocus sequence analysis confirmed the distinctness of bona fide isolates of V. harveyi and V. campbellii, and verified that both species are, indeed, separate entities (Thompson et al. 2007). Certainly, questions have been raised concerning the accuracy of identifying vibrios within the Harveyi clade. This problem may reflect on the associated studies discussed below (Hoffmann et al. 2012; Ke et al. 2017; Urbanczyk et al. 2013).",

The list of hosts is extensive, and includes silvery black porgy (Acanthopagrus cuvieri) and brown spotted grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) in Kuwait (Saeed 1995), common dentex (Dentex dentex) and farmed sole (Solea senegalensis) in Spain (Company et al. 1999; Zorrilla et al. 2003), and farmed sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus) and cage-reared grouper (Epinephelus awoara) in China (Qin et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2002). V. harveyi has been often associated with eye disease, for example in common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) (Kraxberger-Beatty et al. 1990), milkfish (Chanos chanos) in the Philippines (Ishimaru and Muroga 1997), and short sunfish (Mola mola) (Hispano et al. 1997). Without effective chemotherapy, the infected fish would inevitably become blind. In fish, the pathogen has also been attributed with gastro-enteritis, necrotizing enteritis, nodules on the opercula, scale drop and muscle necrosis, skin ulcers, tail rot, and vasculitis in different fish species (Table 1). With the latter infection, the fish were inappetant, lethargic, disoriented, and displayed necrotic subdermal cysts. Internally, meningitis, encephalitis, vasculitis, kidney necrosis, and liver and kidney damage were recorded (Grimes et al. 1985). Also, V. harveyi has been associated with a vibriosis-like disease in Japanese horse mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) when water temperatures were > 25 \u00b0C (Iwamoto et al. 1995). Here, fish displayed a diverse pathology, namely melanosis, erratic swimming behavior, bilateral exophthalmia, and hemorrhaging on/in the internal organs (Iwamoto et al. 1995). V. harveyi appears to exert great severity on/in immunosuppressed fish (Grimes et al. 1985).",

            "text": "Confusion may have resulted previously from reliance on phenotypic diagnostic approaches when misidentification was unknown. Key diagnostic traits, which could allow confusion with V. alginolyticus, included the presence of fermentative motile Gram-negative rods that grew at 11\u201340 \u00b0C in 3\u20138% sodium chloride, produced catalase, oxidase, indole, and lysine and ornithine decarboxylase, but not arginine dihydrolase, reduced nitrates, was negative for the Voges Proskauer reaction, and decomposed blood, DNA, and gelatin but not aesculin, casein or starch, and utilized arabinose, cellobiose, glucose, and sucrose but not inositol or lactose (Austin and Austin 2016). However, modern molecular approaches have heightened the accuracy of diagnoses, and include 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which has become the favored method of identifying isolates accurately (Ransangan and Mustafa 2009) and multilocus sequence analysis, which successfully identified 36 isolates from Australia (Cano-Gomez et al. 2011). It is noteworthy that a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the V. harveyi toxR gene was sensitive, i.e., capable of detecting 4.0 \u00d7 103 cells/ml, and specific to V. harveyi but no other vibrios (Pang et al. 2006). However, a PCR was developed, which was based on the conserved sequence of the gene encoding the OMP vhhP2, and was shown to be quick and fairly specific, although some V. campbellii cultures cross reacted and were misidentified as V. harveyi (Cano-Gomez et al. 2011). Success has been reported for a multiplex PCR, which was both specific and sensitive (Pinto et al. 2017). Similarly, an enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR was developed and regarded as effective for detection of the pathogen (Xu et al. 2017). A highly sensitive [60 colony-forming units (CFU) per reaction] and specific recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) was designed specifically to recognize the V. harveyi toxR gene. The researchers considered that the technique was fast and accurate, permitting effective monitoring of disease outbreaks (Pang et al. 2019).",

Infecting an avirulent V. harveyi strain VIB 642 with VMHL led to virulence and upregulation of hemolysin secretion (Munro et al. 2003). Knowledge of VMHL increased as the complete nucleotide sequence and the open-reading frame (ORF) were determined (Oakey et al. 2002). Furthermore, it has been suggested that bacteriophage may mediate toxicity of isolates in tiger shrimp by transfer of one or more toxin genes or genes controlling toxin production (Ruangpan et al. 1999). Subsequently, a novel siphovirus-like phage 1 (VHS1) was recovered, but a connection with virulence remains to be established (Khemayan et al. 2006; Pasharawipas et al. 2005).",

When brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) nauplii were injected with a range of V. harveyi strains, correlations between mortality of brine shrimp and production of proteases, phospholipases, or siderophores of V. harveyi cultures were observed, but there is no correlation between mortality and hemolytic activity, hydrophobicity, or lipase or gelatinase production (Soto-Rodriguez et al. 2003). A 22 kDa extracellular cysteine protease has been purified (Fukasawa et al. 1988a, b; Liu et al. 1997) and considered to be the major exotoxin to tiger prawns (Lee 1996; Lee et al. 1997; Liu and Lee 1996). Moreover, Harries and Owens (1999) isolated two proteins, which caused mortalities in tiger prawns, and were regarded as both exotoxins and the probable virulence factors. When the ECP of pathogenic strain E2 was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min or digested with proteinase K, it produced the same pathology in Dublin Bay prawns (Nephrops norvegicus) as crude, untreated ECP. Western blotting revealed the presence of low-molecular-weight LPS, which was considered to constitute the lethal toxin (Montero and Austin 1999). However, the same strain was not pathogenic to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Zhang 2001), indicating that the pathogenicity mechanisms of V. harveyi to shrimp and fish may well be different.",

They further correlated virulence of V. harveyi to salmonids with the possession of duplicate hemolysin genes, i.e., vhhA and vhhB. The majority (19/20) of the less virulent or avirulent cultures possessed single genes or none at all (Zhang et al. 2001). The open-reading frame (ORF) of the vhhA and vhhB genes was calculated to be 1257 nucleotides in length, which matches the tlh gene of V. parahaemolyticus (Nishibuchi and Kaper 1985). VHH hemolysin was determined to be homologous with lecithinase of V. cholerae and V. mimicus. The vhhA gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant VHH hemolysin was found to be cytotoxic to Japanese flounder gill cells. The protein caused mortalities in Japanese flounder with the LD50 dose calculated as 18.4 \u00b5g of protein/fish (Zhong et al. 2006). Sun et al. (2007) identified VHH hemolysin as a phospholipase B, and reported that a single residue change (Ser153) in the VHH hemolysin resulted in loss of hemolysin and phospholipase activities, and pathogenicity to turbot. In experiments involving immunolocalization of VHH in tissues of Japanese flounder challenged by the protein, the hemolysin was observed to be confined mainly to intestinal epithelial and gill epithelial cells (Fig. 2), indicating that the intestines and gills may be the primary targets for the invasion of V. harveyi in fish (unpublished data). In addition, recombinant VHH hemolysin induced various apoptotic features (such as apoptotic bodies, chromatin condensation, increased number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells, and caspase-3 activity) in Japanese flounder gill cell line. These data led to the conclusion that VHH inactivated these cells by apoptosis, via the caspase activation pathway (Bai et al. 2010). Moreover, VHH induced apoptosis in silver sea bream (Sparus sarba) and black sea bream (Mylio macrocephalus) fibroblast cell lines. This featured reduced mitochondrial membrane potential prior to increased caspase-3 activity. In short, it was highlighted that hemolysin led to cell death by induction of apoptosis (Deane et al. 2012).",

Luminous vibriosis is so named, because diseased shrimp luminesce, i.e., glow in the dark (Prayitno and Latchford 1995). This raises the question concerning the role of luminescence in virulence. Luminescence may be verified by monitoring the expression of the LuxR gene in quorum sensing. Research has shown that the expression of LuxR and toxicity to shrimp was most important in relation to luminescence (Nakayama et al. 2005). V. harveyi had been confirmed to have all three types, i.e., AHL, AI-2, and CAI-1, of quorum-sensing activities (Yang et al. 2011). Additionally, quorum sensing regulates other virulent factors, such as type III secretion system (Henke and Bassler 2004).",

Sun et al. (2008) determined that V. harveyi could enter VBNC state, and the VBNC cells could be resuscitated via an increase in temperature when grown in the presence of yeast extract and Tween 20 or vitamin B. The resuscitation of dormant cells may well be one of the important reasons for vibriosis outbreaks in aquaculture.",

In addition, it was found that a marine antagonistic strain Pseudoalteromonas flavipulchra JG1 could inhibit the growth of V. harveyi (Jin et al. 2010). From this culture, several small molecule compounds (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, and 6-bromoindolyl-3-acetic acid) with inhibitory effect to V. harveyi were purified (Yu et al. 2012).

            "text": "Whole-cell vaccines In their simplest form, whole-cell vaccines comprise bacterial suspensions, which have been inactivated with chemicals, typically formalin. Whole-cell vaccines have gained considerable success with the control of some fish diseases, and numerous examples have been commercialized, worldwide. The approach has been used to control diseases attributed to V. harveyi. For example, a whole-cell vaccine administered by a variety of techniques, i.e., intraperitoneal injection, anal intubation, and, by immersion, to barramundi (Lates calcarifer) led to demonstrable antibody production. Clearly, the data revealed that barramundi could mount an immune response to vaccination (Crosbie and Nowak 2004). A bivalent vaccine comprising formalized cells of V. harveyi and Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida together with ECP was used in sole both involving immersion together with a booster dose or by i.p. injection. The outcome was excellent protection [relative percent survival (RPS = ~ 88%) for a 4-month period after vaccination]. Subsequently, protection declined (Arijo et al. 2005). A multivalent inactivated vaccine including cells of V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi, V. vulnificus, and infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus was administered to groups of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) leading to excellent protection after challenge (RPS = 80%; Huang et al. 2012). The commercial attraction to inactivated whole vaccines is that they are comparatively inexpensive to produce. Consequently, research has been directed towards improving the performance of these vaccines, such as by entrapping the antigens in liposomes (Harikrishnan et al. 2012c). Use of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1668-enriched plasmid (p60CpG) as an adjuvant with formalized cells led to protection (RPS = 96.2%) in orange-spotted grouper (Nguyen et al. 2017). This led to immunomodulation and increased protection (Harikrishnan et al. 2012b). A similar positive effect resulted from the addition of adjuvant, Montanide, to formalin-inactivated cells, which were used to inject turbot. The vaccine was administered at 1.0 \u00d7 108 cells/fish leading to an RPS of 75% after four weeks (Xu et al. 2019).",

The second concern revolves around whether or not it is possible for an attenuated vaccine cell to acquire virulence determinants in the aquatic environment. There is not any evidence for these concerns, but it is considered necessary for scientists to be aware of and not ignore the issues.

            "text": "Vibrio harveyi is a serious pathogen for multiple species of marine fish and invertebrates particularly occurring in the warm waters of Asia, southern Europe, and South America. Some confusion has resulted with identification of cultures, particular centering on distinguishing V. harveyi and V. campbellii. However, taxonomy studies have confirmed the uniqueness of both of these species. Although virulence has been demonstrated with multiple isolates, there is a lack of clarity over the precise pathogenicity mechanisms, possibly reflecting differences between isolates as well as between fish and invertebrates, and overreliance on laboratory cultures, which are not necessarily reflective of the abilities of fresh isolates. Certainly, hemolysin has been the most extensively studied virulence factor of V. harveyi to date. Some excellent work has been accomplished, and it is realized that hemolysin is capable of killing fish cells by apoptosis via the caspase activation pathway. Maybe, key virulence genes, such as occur on plasmids and bacteriophages, become lost with storage of the so-called laboratory cultures. Fortunately, there has been much progress with the development of effective disease control strategies, including use of dietary supplements and vaccines. Clearly, further work is justified to better under this serious pathogen of marine animals.",
