            "text": "Candidemia, the fourth most common cause of nosocomial sepsis accounts for high attributable mortality (25\u201360%) despite the availability of advanced diagnostic and management strategies [1]. The developing countries report a 4\u201315 times higher rate of candidemia than developed countries although systematic surveillance data are lacking [2]. Paediatric intensive care units (ICUs) exhibit extremely high incidence of candidemia in developing nations when compared to developed countries (42.7 vs. 0.043\u20130.47 per 1000 admissions) [1]. Among Candida species causing candidemia, non-albicans Candida (NAC) species are the leading agents in developing countries with a noticeable decrease of C. albicans in developed nations too [3]. C. glabrata is the major species prevalent in the USA and Europe, while C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis constitute maximum cases in developing countries [4\u20137]. There has been a notable emergence of rare yeasts causing fungaemia worldwide. Such scenario has been observed in India as well. Few outbreaks caused by Pichia anomala, Kodamaea ohmeri and C. auris have been reported from India [8\u201310]. Although relatively uncommon, C. krusei is implicated in causing candidemia outbreaks worldwide with a very few case numbers. Earlier, two C. krusei candidemia outbreaks have been reported from India in neonatal ICU (NICU) with seven and six cases [11, 12]. The rise of C. krusei is of concern due to its intrinsic resistance to fluconazole. Few studies suggest that C. krusei infection is acquired in the hospital settings although mechanisms are not delineated [13]. We noticed a sudden and sustained surge of candidemia cases by C. krusei (n = 82) at paediatrics unit of our centre during a 1-year period which is the highest number recorded in any C. krusei outbreak worldwide. The present study reports the results of the epidemiological investigation of the prolonged outbreak of candidemia by C. krusei at our tertiary care centre.",

The nurse spent 20 min during a busy period each day observing and recording compliance of all health care staff and patient attendants in the unit. HH opportunities included before and after patient care, before an invasive procedure, when hands were visibly soiled with blood or body fluids of patients, and before and after removing gloves. To minimize the Hawthorne effect, the participants did not know that they were being observed for HH compliance. Both washing hands with soap and water and rubbing hands with alcohol products counted as HH performed. The total number of opportunities and actual HH performed was recorded by the observer. Compliance was expressed as percentage (observed HH/total opportunities for HH).",

Clonality is defined as the isolates having its origin from the single source/cell and has low degree of genetic exchange due to asexual reproduction [18]. C. albicans and C. tropicalis were used as an out-group, and C. krusei ATCC 6258 was used as control. Additionally, representative isolates of C. krusei isolated from 2014\u20132018 were also subjected to molecular typing to determine whether the outbreak strains are still circulating in the hospital. DNA extraction from the isolates and its quality check was performed as described earlier. DNA was digested using a pair of restriction enzymes HpyCH4IV and MseI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). DNA ligase enzyme was used to ligate respective adapters to the fragments generated. Pre-selective amplification was done using per-selective primers of HpyCH4IV (5\u2032-GTAGACTGCGTACCCGT-3\u2032) and MseI (5\u2032-GATGAGTCCTGACTAA-3\u2032). For selective amplification, HpyCH4IV primer with one selective residue (5\u2032-GTAGACTGCGTACCCGTC-3\u2032) and MseI primer (5\u2032-GATGAGTCCTGACTAACA-3\u2032) with two selective residues were used and the primers of HpyCH4IV were labelled with 6-FAM. Capillary electrophoresis of the amplified products along with LIZ 500 (size standard marker) was performed in an ABI automated DNA Sequencer 3130 (Applied Bioscience, Foster City, CA, USA). Typing data were then imported to BIONUMERICS v 7.6 software (Applied Maths, Ghent, Belgium). The fingerprint curves were converted into bands, and normalized bands for each lane were assigned using the band position of the reference dye (LIZ500). The similarity coefficient was estimated by Pearson correlation with negative similarities clipped to zero. Cluster analysis was performed by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) [17]. Isolates showing > 96% similarity were considered to exhibit clonal origin.",

The present study represents the largest cluster (n = 82) of C. krusei candidemia cases reported till date. A sudden upsurge in the number of C. krusei candidemia cases to 44.09% in the year 2014 as compared to 4.93% in 2012 prompted us to perform epidemiological investigation. The majority of the cases were neonates (79.3%) who are an established risk group for developing candidemia due to their weak immune system and fragile skin/gut barrier [18]. The previously described outbreaks of C. krusei candidemia are either from neonates or from haematology oncology wards (Table 3). We noticed the presence of gastrointestinal disease and prior exposure to antibiotics, especially to carbapenems as significant risk factors for acquiring C. krusei candidemia compared to C. pelliculosa candidemia patients. These risk factors along with total parenteral nutrition and central venous catheter are previously reported in neonatal C. krusei candidemia cases [19, 20]. The use of fluconazole prophylaxis is reported as a risk factor for the majority of C. krusei outbreaks though this practice is not prevalent in our hospital [18, 19]. The overall in-hospital mortality rate (22.9%, n = 17) among C. krusei infected patients was lower than C. tropicalis (42.9%) candidemia patients which may be attributed to its lower virulence potential as described previously [21].",

C. krusei was isolated from washbasin of NUPE consistently being used by the HCWs after attending the patients. The FAFLP results suggest that three major clones of C. krusei were circulating throughout the year in these paediatric units. The majority of the isolates revealed genetic similarity with the environmental isolates. NUPE ward was common among all the four clusters of C. krusei isolates. This is probably because NUPE ward is an emergency ward where the first physical examination of all the paediatric patients is done before being transferred to different units. Due to huge rush of neonatal patients in NUPE, high patient-to-bed ratio may compromise the infection control practices and contribute to higher risk of cross-transmission.

Table 3 shows the previous C. krusei candidemia outbreaks across the world [11\u201313, 18, 22, 30\u201332]. Few of them could localize the environmental source of transmission. Hautala et al. [13] and Ricardo et al. [30] from Europe could isolate the related strains of outbreak from sink traps and surfaces, respectively. Several recurrent outbreaks of C. krusei candidemia have been reported in neonatal ICUs due to contaminated environmental sources from India and South Africa [11, 12, 18]. Rongpharpi et al. and Duggal et al. reported three C. krusei outbreaks over a period of 4 years (September 2011, May 2013 and October 2014). In their study from a single centre, they found contaminated intravenous multi-electrolyte dextrose infusate bottle (different brands) as the source in first two outbreaks and a suction apparatus in the third outbreak [11, 12]. A large outbreak of C. krusei candidemia (n = 48, 8.2% incidence) was reported by van Schalkwyk et al. [18] among infants of Gauteng Province in South Africa over a period of 4 months in 2014. Subsequently, another large outbreak of 41 cases of C. krusei was reported in April\u2013July 2015 although source could not be traced in both these outbreaks. None of the previous studies have reported isolation of C. krusei from hands of HCWs. We could track down the possible sources of transmission of C. krusei in our study to a washbasin in the NUPE ward and hands of one of the HCWs who was posted in different wards at the same time. Moist surface like washbasins tend to provide a niche for the survival of yeasts and may get into the hands of HCWs by consistently using this washbasin. Nevertheless, overcrowding, limited infrastructural capacity, compromise in preventive hygiene measures and non-compliance with infection control practices may also contribute in causing outbreaks.",

All the yeasts isolated in this study from the blood and environment were accurately identified by MALDI-TOF MS as per our previous protocol [33, 34]. Restriction endonuclease assay (REA), pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) methods were used in previous studies to find the relatedness among clinical and environmental strains [11\u201313, 30]. Here, we utilized the most robust and reproducible typing method, FAFLP technique to establish genetic relatedness among blood and environmental isolates. Previously, we reported the effectiveness of AFLP in determining genetic relatedness of isolates due to other fungi from our centre[8, 9, 29, 34\u201336]. Clustering of environmental isolates with the majority of the blood isolates indicates the hospital environment as the major source of infection. The isolation of C. krusei from washbasin of NUPE increases the probability of transmission to other fomites as well. Additionally, few C. krusei blood isolates clustered with isolate from HCW. This indicates cross-transmission of C. krusei from environmental sources to hands of HCWs and then to the susceptible patients. Moreover, the representative isolates of C. krusei from 2014 analysed did not show genetic relatedness with isolates from other years suggesting frequent introduction of new strains periodically into the hospital [11\u201313, 30].",

The overcrowding possibly due to high influx of patients per day, high baby-to-bed ratio and lower staff-to-baby ratio led to an extended outbreak. Cross-transmission can be controlled by HCWs by strictly following hand hygiene protocols as per WHO recommendations [37]. Other crucial practices which involve the removal of catheters, optimal use of antibiotics, rapid transition from parenteral to enteral diet and avoidance of H2 blockers may help restricting acquisition of Candida species [1]. Periodic environmental decontamination and strict adherence to hand hygiene practices post-outbreak and also pinpointing the source helped containing further rise in numbers of C. krusei candidemia patients in our hospital. Decrease in the hand hygiene compliance again in 2018 could be due to the administration protocol in which nursing staff working in non-paediatric units were posted in these areas (Fig. 4).",

The strengthening of infection control practices helped control the outbreak in subsequent years. The molecular typing (FAFLP) of C. krusei strains from same wards from 2014 to 2018 did not show any relatedness signifying the emergence of new strains over the years. Suboptimal adherence to infection control practices probably due to overcrowded paediatric facility led to the huge number of C. krusei candidemia outbreak at our centre. Evaluating the colonization status of the patients may provide much better insight into acquisition of this infection.",
