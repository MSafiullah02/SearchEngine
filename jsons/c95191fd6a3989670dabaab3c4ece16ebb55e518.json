The thoracic cavity contains the heart, great vessels, esophagus, and lungs, surrounded by the musculoskeletal constituents of the chest wall. The lungs are particularly sensitive to RT, and are consequentially a dose-limiting structure when planning therapy. The lungs are complex organs, consisting of the large central airways such as the trachea and mainstem bronchi, the smaller conducting airways, a complex vascular network, and the alveolar sacs where gas exchange occurs. Irradiation of the trachea and proximal bronchi can lead to mucosal irritation, clinically manifesting as a dry cough. However, late complications of the conducting airways (e.g., fistula or stenosis) are unusual with conventional doses of RT. The proximal vascular network is generally considered to be relatively insensitive to the effects of RT. The primary toxicity from lung irradiation is related to the alveolar/capillary complex.",

In addition to being directly toxic to cells, ROS/RNS instigate a host of molecular cascades which alter the cytokine milieu leading to chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and remodeling. Edema and extravasation of proteinaceous material into the alveoli can be appreciated within a few weeks after RT as increased density on radiographs (Skoczylas et al. 2000) . If the volume of inflammed lung is large, pulmonary symptoms can develop 1-6 months after RT. Within 3 months after completing RT (and maybe sooner), there is a reduction in pulmonary function tests secondary to thickening of the intraalveolar septum (edema and fibrosis) and loss of alveoli. The RT-induced microenvironment of chronic inflammation, hypoxia, and fibrosis appears to be self-sustaining leading to progressive decline in pulmonary function. Our understanding of the cellular and biochemical changes that occur in the lung after RT continues to evolve (Brush et al. 2007; Fleckenstein et al. 2007; Tsoutsou and Koukourakis 2006) (see Sect. 3) .",

Most patients with breast cancer have ample lung reserve, especially relative to the small volume of lung within the RT fields. Therefore, the incidence of clinical symptoms is low. Typical pneumonitis rates are in the range of 1-5 %, with severe injury being even less common.",

Primary lung tumors typically invade into, and replace, normal lung. Further, the primary lung tumor or enlarged hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes can compress central airways/vessels that can decrease overall cardiopulmonary function. In these instances, the damaging effects of RT on the lung are often, at least partially, off-set by RT-induced reductions in tumor mass that may increase lung function. For such patients, the resultant change in lung function after thoracic RT is typically a balance between the radiotoxic effects on the normal lung and improvement in lung function resulting from tumor shrinkage.",

The right lung normally has three lobes separated by two fissures. The horizontal fissure separates the upper and middle lobes while the oblique fissure separates the lower lobe from the middle and upper lobes. The left lung normally has two lobes (upper and lower) divided by an oblique fissure. The lobes can be further subdivided into segments. The lingula (Latin-little tongue) is part of the upper lobe and is composed of a superior and inferior segments (Fig. 2) . The architecture of the lung can be considered as subunits arranged in both parallel and series. Centrally, the structure is ''in series'' as the large vessels and airways in the mediastinum and hilum support all of the distal vessels and airways to which they are connected. Fibrosis/stenosis of a central vessel or bronchus will render the downstream alveoli nonfunctional. Conversely, in the periphery, the smaller alveolar/capillary units function relatively independently (i.e., ''in parallel''). Resection or injury to a region of lung will not compromise function of adjacent regions. The alveolar/capillary units appear far more sensitive to the effects of RT than the central conducting airways and vessels. Therefore, most RT-induced injury is referable to these ''peripheral'' structures and the lung is classically considered a ''parallel'' organ regarding RTinduced effects.",

Terminal bronchioles branch into transitional airways (respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts) which contribute to gaseous exchange. The transitional airways terminate in alveolar sacs which open into the alveoli. The principal function of the lungs is to facilitate gas exchange between alveoli and adjoining capillaries. Gas exchange is most efficient when the thickness of intervening tissues is minimal. Adjacent alveoli share a common wall, termed the interalveolar septum, which contains capillaries and a fine connective tissue framework. Within the interalveolar septum, the adjacent basal lamina of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium are often fused providing a thin barrier between the erythrocytes in the capillaries and the alveolar air space (*0.5 lm). The capillaries wrap around the alveoli creating a prodigious surface area for diffusion (50-100 m 2 ).",

They are round cells with larger nuclei, and contain prominent lamellar bodies (cytosomes) which contain dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (surfactant), which reduces surface tension within the alveoli.

Indeed, many of the signaling pathways implicated in radiation injury, such as the TGF-b pathway, are sensitive to changes in cellular redox status (Tyler and Blackman 1922; Groover et al. 1922) . The transient nature of ionizing radiation suggests that a mechanism of amplification of ROS/RNS occurs after radiation. Proposed mechanisms include activation of oxidant-generating enzymes, such as NADPH oxidases, mitochondrial leakage, and the respiratory burst from activated inflammatory mediators recruited to the site of injury. The role of NADPH oxidases is supported by the fact that TGF-b is activated by radiation and that in turn, TGF-b can activate the NADPH oxidase isoform, Nox4. Newer data coming to light recently have shown a critical role for Nox4 in TGF-b mediated apoptosis (Hines 1922) and downstream Smad signaling (Davis 1924) .",

Fleckenstein et al. demonstrated that tissue perfusion begins to decrease 3 days after radiation exposure, resolves for approximately 2 weeks, and then progressively decreases throughout the time of disease progression (Skoczylas et al. 2000) . In parallel, the lung tissue becomes increasingly hypoxic (Skoczylas et al. 2000) . The late decrease in tissue oxygenation is likely a result of fibrous obliteration of capillaries and decreased gas exchange due to increased alveolar wall thickness and edema/congestion within the alveolar space. The early drop in perfusion cannot be explained by these events and is more likely a result of vasoconstriction, although this is not confirmed. The activation of NADPH oxidase after radiation increases superoxide production, which may suppress vasodilation by oxidizing key enzymes within the NO signaling pathway or through rapid reaction with NO itself to form peroxynitrite. Both of these reactions can interfere with NO signaling leading to vasoconstriction, a transient loss in tissue perfusion, and tissue hypoxia. Tissue hypoxia, a fundamental feature underlying the development of lung injury, develops several weeks after lung irradiation and progresses with time, presumably as a result of injury to the pulmonary vascular and decreased perfusion (Skoczylas et al. 2000; Bernier et al. Fig. 4 Cytokine cascade associated with lung injury. Cellcell interactions and control of gene expression by growth factors among alveolar cells is shown (with permission from McDonald et al. 1995, IJROBP LENT SOMA) 2004). Changes in pulmonary perfusion have been observed within months following high doses of radiation in humans (Bentzen 2006; Mikkelsen and Wardman 2003) and within weeks in rodent models (Skoczylas et al. 2000; Rubin et al. 1995; Jackson et al. 2006) . In studies by Fleckenstein et al. (Skoczylas et al. 2000) , the transient decrease in perfusion was associated with increased edema and elevated expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1a) and TGFb. In that study, the vascular perfusion changes were noted before the development of histologically apparent and functional disease.",

(Johnston et al. 1996) found that in vitro TGF-b production by macrophages could be induced by hypoxia (0.5% O 2 ), prior to the onset of VEGF production.

TGF-b is secreted as an inactive polypeptide by a number of cells including macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells of the lung. The inactive precursor is sequestered in the extracellular matrix with its latencyassociated peptide (LAP), which has been suggested to be the ''sensory'' portion of the protein (Marks et al. 1997; Theuws et al. 2000; Peterson et al. 1992; Dor et al. 2001; Li et al. 2001 ). The LAP is sensitive to free radicals, changes in cellular pH, and integrins, all of which can induce activation of TGF-b which readily binds the TGF-b type II receptor to stimulate the Smad second messenger signaling pathway (Bartholdi et al. 1997 ). Activation of TGF-b and subsequent translocation of Smad2/3 protein into the nucleus of the responding cell leads to transcription of genes involved in fibroproliferation and tissue repair (Li et al. 2007; van Hinsbergh et al. 2001 ). An increase in TGFb protein can be observed within 24 hours following radiation exposure (Skoczylas et al. 2000; Dor et al. 2001; Anscher et al. 1998 Anscher et al. , 2006 . Epperly et al. (Rodemann et al. 1996) found a biphasic TGF-b surge associated with the early and delayed radiation response in mice after 20 Gy whole lung irradiation. The establishment of TGF-b as a mediator of radiation-induced lung injury has led to a number of studies evaluating circulating serum TGF-b levels as a potential biomarker for increased risk of lung injury as well as pre-clinical testing of inhibitors of TGF-b and/or its signaling pathway. These studies have used either neutralizing antibodies or adenoviral vectors to demonstrate significantly reduced histological and functional damage in rodent models of lung injury following radiation exposure. Reduced lung damage was also associated with decreased cytokine activity, fewer macrophages, and less oxidative stress (Kang et al. 2003; Barcellos-Hoff 1996; Rahimi and Leof 2007) .",

Symptomatic and histologically relevant lung injury is preceded by cytokine production and communication, inflammatory cell infiltration, changes in blood flow and perfusion, and increased vascular permeability (Bernier et al. 2004; Roberts 1999; Barcellos-Hoff 1993; Barcellos-Hoff et al. 1994; Stone et al. 2003 , Vujaskovic et al. 2000 .

Utilizing a split dose exposure, the early pneumonitis phase was not expressed, however, the late occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis appeared between 6-12 months. This was confirmed in similar studies by Siemann et al.

Utilizing knock out mice for 1 CAM expression compared to wild type mice, Hallahan demonstrated a lower incidence of lung injury due to blocking the 1 CAM-1 pathway (Hallahan et al. 2002) .

The trachea and proximal airways are lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells with admixed mucus producing goblet cells. Since these cells have a relatively rapid turnover rate, the mucosa can become acutely denuded during RT. Mild dry cough and/or sore throat during RT is likely related to RT-induced changes in the epithelial lining and decreased clearance of intratracheal debris. Due to the rapid cellular turnover, the depleted mucosa is typically replenished promptly after completing RT and the associated symptoms are transient. The supporting vascular and other connective tissues are comprised primarily of quiescent ''mature'' cells with a relatively slow mitotic rate. Although no clinical/pathologic findings are typically observed acutely in these tissues during thoracic RT, late normal tissue injury is possible. For example, bronchial stenosis has been observed following high-dose external beam RT (Miller et al. 2005 ) as well as brachytherapy (Speiser and Spratling 1993) . Similarly, we have seen a case of diffuse pulmonary hypoperfusion after high-dose external beam RT, apparently due to fibrosis of central vascular structures. Months to years following RT, a fibrotic reaction develops within irradiated lung parenchyma. Whether this is a direct effect of RT on the cells comprising the supporting connective tissues, or due to an RT response in other cells, is unclear. While this fibrotic reaction is generally considered to be progressive and irreversible, there is limited experimental data suggesting that this process can be modified and perhaps even reversed (Delanian et al. 1994 (Delanian et al. , 1999 .",

Further, since abnormalities on CT and CXR are very common following RT, reported studies that consider asymptomatic radiologic findings as 'an event' likely overestimate the rate of 'clinical toxicity'. Differentiating radiation pneumonitis from other etiologies (e.g., tumor progression, infection, pulmonary emboli, heart disease) can be challenging (Kocak et al. 2005) .

We and investigators at the NKI have attempted to relate the sum of the changes in regional perfusion (also termed the integrated response) to changes in pulmonary symptoms and PFTs, with mixed success. While there is a strong correlation between the sum of regional injuries and changes in global function, the correlation coefficients are weak, suggesting that there may be numerous other factors affecting global pulmonary function (Fan et al. 2001; Theuws et al. 1998 ).

Loss of alveolar surface area and thickening of the intraalveolar septi are the primary causes for reductions in DLCO. Thus, both acute (edema, extravasation of material into the alveoli) and chronic (fibrosis, loss of alveoli) injury can affect DLCO. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is another useful parameter and often interpreted in the context of the FEV1/FVC ratio (FVC = forced vital capacity).

For low-dose rate TBI (5-10 cGy/min), assuming lung density corrections, an early study concluded that the threshold dose for pneumonitis is approximately 9 Gy, the TD 5 (dose resulting in a 5% complication rate) is approximately 10 Gy, with a TD 50 (dose resulting in a 50% complication rate) of 11-12 Gy (Keane et al. 1981) . When higher dose rates are utilized, principally for hemibody irradiation, the dose response curve is shifted to the left. In this circumstance, the threshold dose was estimated to be approximately 7 Gy, with a TD 5 of 8 Gy and a TD 50 of approximately 9.3 Gy (Keane et al. 1981) . In a more recent, comprehensive review, the TD 5 (with cyclophosphamide) Abratt and Willcox (1995) 4 2 1 3 1 4 a 45 of patients with baseline FEV1 C50% without significant ventilation or perfusion shift to contralateral lung b Estimated from graphs provided c Transfer factor for carbon monoxide corrected for hemoglobin level and alveolar volume Lung was estimated to be much lower, approximately 5 Gy for low-dose rate TBI (Sampath et al. 2005) . Both studies demonstrated that the dose response curve for whole lung irradiation is steep such that a difference of only 1-2 Gy increases the risk of pneumonitis significantly (Fig. 8) The development of pneumonitis after whole lung irradiation is an ominous sign, proving fatal in up to 80% of patients (Fryer et al. 1978) . The difference in mortality for similar doses between TBI and HBI dose response appears to have been due to the low-dose rate protraction for TBI. Decreasing the dose rate from 0.5 to 0.1 by per minute decreases the incidence of pneumonitis associated with whole lung irradiation during TBI. This was a byproduct of greater distance from the radiation source, required to produce a large field to encompass the whole body.",

A European study treated patients with 17.5 Gy in 2 weeks without chemotherapy (Breur et al. 1978) . Lung density corrections were not utilized in either study, and thus the true total physical doses delivered were likely in the neighborhood of 17 and 20 Gy in these two studies, respectively. No cases of pneumonitis were reported in either trial. A retrospective study of whole lung irradiation for a variety of tumor histologies, mostly pediatric, reported no cases of pneumonitis after doses ranging from 15-25 Gy (Newton and Spittle 1969) . Furthermore, in several retrospective studies in which TBI was utilized in the preparative regimen prior to stem cell transplant, the risk of interstitial pneumonitis appeared to be lower with fractionation (Cosset et al. 1989; Pino et al. 1982; Shank et al. 1983 ). These studies suggest that fractionation increases lung tolerance. However, in two randomized studies comparing single fraction TBI with fractionated TBI, there was no difference in the risk of interstitial pneumonitis (virus ? idiopathic) ( Table 6 ). There were less cases of idiopathic pneumonitis with fractionation (Deeg et al. 1986; Girinsky et al. 2000) .",

However, these findings have been inconsistent across studies, such that none of these parameters have been found to be a robust and reliable risk factor for the development of RT-induced lung injury. Fig. 8 The risk of pneumonitis following whole lung RT as part of TBI. The addition of chemotherapy appears to move the dose response curve to the left, and fractionating the RT moves the dose response curve to the right (Adopted from QUANTEC, Marks et al. 2010, IJROBP) Preclinical and clinical data suggest that irradiation of lower lung regions may be more clinically important than irradiation of upper lung regions. This may be secondary to nonuniform distribution of gas exchange throughout the lung and/or incidental heart dose. In mice, Travis et al. (1997) demonstrated that the lower lobes are more radiosensitive (increased respiratory rate, lethality) than the upper lobes. In another rodent study, the respiratory rate following thoracic RT was related to both the volume of lung and heart irradiated (van Luijk et al. 2005) . Similarly, RT-induced changes in breathing rate were greater with left-versus right-sided RT in rats (Wiegman et al. 2003) , suggesting that incidental dose to the heart may contribute to symptomatic RT-induced lung injury. Many (Graham et al. 1999; Hope et al. 2006; Seppenwoolde et al. 2004; Yorke et al. 2005) , but not all (Robnett et al. 2000; Tsujino et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2006 ) clinical studies have shown increased rates of radiation pneumonitis with treatment of lower lobe tumors. As stated above, part of these effects may be related to incidental cardiac irradiation, as a greater volume of heart is the field with lower lobe targets.",

For patients receiving RT, it has been more challenging to quantitatively relate pre-RT PFTs to the risk of subsequent RT-induced lung injury. One of the challenges for considering pulmonary function in the pre-RT assessment is that it may be compromised by the tumor itself, and that treatment may lead to improvements in pulmonary function with tumor shrinkage.",

Traditional DVHs assume that all regions of the lung contribute equally to pulmonary function, which is often an erroneous assumption since many patients have heterogenous regional lung function (e.g., from tumor or COPD). Furthermore, metrics such as the V20 or V30 (volume of lung receiving at least 20 or 30 Gy, respectively), consider only a single point on the cumulative DVH. It is apparent that two DVHs with markedly different shape may overlap at the same point (V20, for instance). MLD might be a preferable metric since it considers the TBI total body irradiation, CYC cyclophosphamide, MEL melphalan a Lungs shielded to 8 Gy b Lungs shielded to 9 Gy Lung entire 3D dose distribution. In practice, it may not be particularly useful to try to determine which parameter is truly ''optimal'' since there tends to be strong correlations between the different dosimetric parameters, at least with relatively uniform treatment techniques (Fan et al. 2001; Graham et al. 1999; Kong et al. 2006) . In most series, the majority of patients are treated with MLDs in the lower aspect of the range shown in Fig. 9a . Thus, even though the incidence of pneumonitis is less when the MLD is lower, the absolute number of patients with pneumonitis derived from the low-MLD group is relatively high. In this regard, MLD is not particularly sensitive (i.e., it does not predict a high fraction of the pneumonitis cases). An alternative manner to illustrate the approximate relationship between dose/volume/risk is shown in Fig. 10 .",

The numbers in the rectangles are the estimated risks of injury with the corresponding dose (left y-axis) and volume (x-axis). The right y-axis indicates the tolerance dose ranges for the TD 5 and TD 50 for whole organ (lungs) irradiation, as well as the TD 5 and TD 50 for the partial organ volume (POV) irradiation. (with permission from Clinical Oncology 8th Edition) delivers lower doses of radiation to larger volumes of surrounding normal tissue. The impact of large-volume/lowdose lung irradiation in the context of curative treatment of lung cancer is not known. The M.D. Anderson Cancer Center recently published the largest clinical experience using IMRT in 68 patients with lung cancer (Yom et al. 2007) . In this report, the incidence of grade C3 radiation pneumonitis was significantly lower in those patients treated using IMRT versus their comparison group treated with conventional 3D-conformal RT (8 vs. 32% at 12 months, p = 0.002). In the IMRT group, patients with V5 values (volume of lung receiving more than 5 Gy) greater than 70% appeared to be at higher risk of pneumonitis. Other dosimetric parameters (MLD, V20) were not assessed for their association with pneumonitis. Investigators at Memorial Sloane Kettering Hospital noted a similarly low rate of clinical lung injury in patients with non-small cell cancer treated with IMRT (Sura et al. 2008) . Additional experience is necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of IMRT for lung cancer. Further, the dosimetric predictors of pneumonitis might be different with a limited number of conformal beams versus IMRT.",

In contrast to the standard method of treating lung cancer (1.8-2 Gy daily fractions given over a period of 6-7 weeks) this unique approach uses only a few very large fractions given over 5-10 days. Currently used fractionation schemes of 18 Gy 9 3, 12 Gy 9 4, and 10 Gy 9 5 appear to provide a reasonable therapeutic ratio for small lesions. These large daily doses are feasible because only small volumes are treated with conformal techniques, which minimizes dose to surrounding critical structures. Within 6-12 months after SBRT, most patients develop increased tissue density on CT in the high-dose region (Hof et al. 2003; Kyas et al. 2007) , which can be difficult to differentiate from persistent tumor. Symptoms consistent with radiation pneumonitis have occurred in 2-25% of patients (Stephans et al. 2009; Hoyer et al. 2006; Nagata et al. 2005; Timmerman et al. 2003) . Serious, and sometimes lethal, pulmonary toxicity has associated with treatment of perihilar/central tumors (Song et al. 2009; Timmerman et al. 2006) , especially with the 20 Gy 9 3 regimen. Whether more protracted regimens (e.g., 10 Gy 9 5) are safer for central tumors is not presently clear and dose-escalation studies are ongoing. PFT changes after SBRT appear to be minimal (Stephans et al. 2009 ). As experience with this radiation technique is being rapidly gained, our understanding of the effects of hypofractionated, high-dose RT to very small volumes of lung will become more broadly known in the near future.",

In this manner, extremely high doses of RT (up to 102.9 Gy) were successfully delivered (Hayman et al. 2001) with *15% risk of radiation pneumonitis and no cases of grade 4-5 toxicity (Kong et al. 2006 ).",

            "text": "The lung is one of the most challenging organs to define dose/volume constraints. Many patients with lung cancer require large treatment fields due to tumor extent. The radiation oncologist does not always have the option to reduce the volume of lung irradiated. Further, there is marked inter-patient variation in pre-RT lung disease (e.g., COPD), and tumor-related pulmonary compromise. It may not be appropriate to force strict dose/volume constraints based on pre-RT pulmonary status, since poor pre-RT function maybe due to the tumor itself, and hence may actually improve with RT. Therefore, patients need to be counseled about the possible risks of lung injury and the uncertainty in defining individual risk. With these caveats in mind, there are nevertheless some broad guidelines that can be clinically useful (Table 7) . We recommend limiting the volume of lung receiving over 20 Gy (V20) to 30-35% (Graham et al. 1999) and limiting the MLD to 20-23 Gy (Hernando et al. 2001; Kwa et al. 1998) . Recent data suggest that the volume of lung exposed to relatively low doses of RT (e.g., 5-15 Gy) may be more predictive for pneumonitis than V20-30 (Schallenkamp et al. 2007; Uno et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006) . This is particularly relevant when IMRT techniques are utilized or when patients with mesothelioma are treated after extrapleural pneumonectomy. However, further investigation is necessary to understand the biological and clinical ramifications of low-dose RT to large volumes of lung. Symptomatic bronchial stenosis has been observed with doses [70 Gy, thus care should be taken when irradiating central structures to high doses. Dose guidelines for IMRT intensity-modulated radiation therapy, EPP extrapleural pneumonectomy a Dose guidelines need to be considered and modified based on the clinical situation, competing risks, and other confounding issues that may affect the absolute risk and acceptance of risk Bleomycin (Toledo et al. 1982; Tryka et al. 1982; Maher and Daly 1993; White and Stover 1984; Einhorn et al. 1976; Rudders and Hensley 1973; Sleijfer 2001) BOOP a Interstitial pneumonitis Fibrosis Bleomycin is inactivated by bleomycin hydrolase, which has low activity in the lungs Busulfan (Oliner et al. 1961; Feingold and Koss 1969; Hankins et al. 1978; Min and Gyorkey 1968) Interstitial fibrosis Mechanism unknown correlates with cumulative dose",

Toxicities are often dose-dependent and related to other factors such as concurrent administration of other chemotherapeutic drugs and/or RT. Although many toxicities are reversible with discontinuation of medication, some are permanent and may occur as part of late manifestations of treatment. As a result, a high index of suspicion is needed for patients who present with respiratory symptoms, particularly in those for whom the treatment is known to been associated with an increased risk of lung damage. Lung toxicity has been reported with a number of chemotherapeutic agents (Table 8 ) (Carver et al. 2007) . It is important to note, however, that chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity is largely considered a diagnosis of exclusion after fully considering and exploring other differential diagnoses (i.e., typical and atypical infections, COPD exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, etc.). The first recognition that chemotherapy could produce late effect fibrosis in lung without pneumonitis was a tragic event. In children with brain tumors, the administration of the nitrosoureas (BUDR) was continued and prolonged, judging toxicity hematologically. Eventually, 35% of brain tumor survivors died of lung fibrosis. Twelve percent died within three years of treatment, however, 24% died of progressive lung fibrosis being symptom free for 7-12 years.",

Although the exact mechanism is unknown, the pulmonary specific drug toxicity is felt to be in part due to the fact that the inactivating enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase, is less expressed in normal lung tissue compared to other normal tissues (Sikic 1986 ). Exposure to high FiO 2 has also been associated with exacerbation of bleomycin toxicity in animal models and humans (Gilson and Sahn 1985; Allen et al. 1981; Toledo et al. 1982; Tryka et al. 1982) . Clinical manifestations include an acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis or a fibrosing alveolitis that may occur acutely, subacutely, or [6 months following exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific, as is the case in many presentations of chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity, and may include fever, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxemia, etc. Although treatment in the acute setting has traditionally consisted of prompt discontinuation of bleomycin and initiation of corticosteroids, reports are anecdotal and nonrandomized (Maher and Daly 1993; White and Stover 1984) .",

For example, in a small series of 24 lung cancer patients treated with 40 Gy of RT with concurrent doxorubicin (10 mg/m 2 ), 13 (54%) developed radiation pneumonitis. Combinations of RT and chemotherapeutic agents with known pulmonary toxicity have generally been associated with higher rates of radiation pneumonitis, including mitomycin-C (Rancati et al. 2003) and bleomycin (Einhorn et al. 1976 ). The taxane docetaxel, with RT in the locally advanced setting and with gemcitabine in the metastatic setting (Kouroussis et al. 2004) , has also been associated with high rates of pneumonitis. For example, in a Japanese phase II study (Onishi et al. 2003) , lung cancer patients were treated with 60-66 Gy with concurrent weekly docetaxel (20 mg/m 2 ). The rate of grade 3-4 pneumonitis was 47%. Fortunately, the chemotherapeutic agents most commonly utilized with RT for lung cancer, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide, have not been consistently shown to increase the risk of pneumonitis (Robnett et al. 2000; Graham et al. 1999; Hope et al. 2006; Hernando et al. 2001) . The impact of chemotherapy in the setting of TBI is shown in Fig. 8 .",

This was intensely studied by Morgan and Breit who lavaged the contralateral lung in a series of breast cancer patients post-irradiation. Although asymptomatic, the lavaged contralateral lung yielded an increase in lymphocytes and macrophages which was termed an autoimmune effect. Finklestein, Rubin and Williams observed a dramatic increase in the contralateral lung abnormalities following ipsilateral lung irradiation. Other investigators have confirmed abscopal out-of-field effects when confining radiation to the apex or base of lung attributed to cytokine cascades, inducing an inflammatory response in shielded lung segments. DNA damage in micronuclei are also evident in addition to lymph acidic infiltrates. The induction of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in out of field lung, induced by in field radiation pneumonitis can be fatal. Bennett and Million reported that 8% (6/72) of lung cancer patients at necropsy had ARDSas did 3% of patients iiradiated for breast cancer, which had been attributed to bilateral radiation pneumonitis.",

Tumor can spread anywhere within the pleural space, including the fissures, diaphragmatic and pericardial surfaces, and the pleural recesses. RT techniques have historically been suboptimal to fully encompass sites at risk while respecting normal tissue tolerance. Recently, there has been growing interest in IMRT for these patients as it tends to be well suited for the delivery of the necessary concave dose distribution. In an initial report from MD Anderson, a low rate of lethal radiation pneumonitis was noted (1.6%, 1/62) (Stevens et al. 2005) . A subsequent report from Harvard could not replicate the safety of this approach. Of 13 patients treated with IMRT, 6 experienced lethal radiation pneumonitis (46%, 6/13) (Allen et al. 2006) . The MLD was 15 Gy for patients who developed pneumonitis (all lethal) versus 13 Gy for those who did not (p = 0.07). Similarly, the V20 was 18% for patients who developed pneumonitis versus 11% for those who did not (p = 0.08). In a reanalysis of the data from MD Anderson, fatal pulmonary toxicities (whether previously ascribed to RT or not) were noted to have occurred in 10% of patients. These events were more common in patients with higher V20 values (Rice et al. 2006) . While IMRT may be particularly suited for the concave targets encountered with the postoperative treatment of mesothelioma, dose to the contralateral lung must be minimized. In this setting, we recommend limiting the V20 to 4-10% and the MLD to \\8 Gy (Allen et al. 2006; Rice et al. 2006) (Table 7) .",

In lung perfusion SPECT, injected radiolabeled microspheres are trapped in the small capillaries of the lung. The local concentration, in principle, is proportional to regional pulmonary blood flow. Lung function is nonuniform in most patients with lung cancer secondary to COPD. SPECT provides a three-dimensional map of functioning alveolarcapillary units. When selecting beam orientations for a patient with an intrathoracic tumor, one can orient the beam such that it preferentially passes through hypoperfused regions of lung (Marks et al. 1995) . Similarly, the quantitative functional information from SPECT can be used to define dose/volume constraints for IMRT planning (McGuire et al. 2006; Shioyama et al. 2007 ). These approaches assume that hypofunctional regions of lung are permanently nonfunctioning. However, if hypoperfusion is caused by an obstructing tumor, then it may be temporary and may improve with tumor shrinkage, and this should be taken into account in the RT planning process. In our experience, areas of hypoperfusion that are adjacent to large central lung lesions often demonstrate reperfusion on post-RT scans. Conversely, areas of hypoperfusion that are ''apart'' from the gross tumor do not demonstrate reperfusion post-RT. Thus, care must be taken when incorporating such functional information into the planning process.",

            "text": "The most effective way to reduce the complications of pulmonary irradiation is to decrease the volume of lung that is exposed to the beam. It has been amply demonstrated that tumors within the lung may move with respiration. This is most commonly accounted for by adding a safety margin (the CTV ? PTV expansion accounts for daily setup error and organ motion). Though this is an easy solution to the problem, it is clearly detrimental as it leads to increased normal tissue exposure. Three strategies to account for respiratory motion are breath hold (often at deep inspiration, termed DIBH), respiratory gating (Mageras and Yorke 2004; Jiang 2006) , and tracking. In DIBH, treatment planning and delivery is performed with the patient holding their breath in deep inspiration. DIBH requires a compliant patient with sufficient pulmonary function to hold their breath for a moderate length of time. DIBH has the added advantage of delivering treatment to an expanded lung, thus irradiating a smaller fraction of the lung for a given target size. Respiratory gating, on the other hand, allows the patient to breathe freely and the beam is turned on during a specified phase of the respiratory cycle and turned off when that phase has passed (Giraud et al. 2006) . This technology requires a signal, usually an external marker acting as a surrogate for respiratory motion, to gate the linear accelerator. It is essential to have CT images corresponding to the desired phase of the respiratory cycle for treatment planning, often accomplished using 4D CT technology. Tracking refers to systems where the treatment beam adjusts, in real time, to movements of the intra-thoracic contents. This is most commonly performed using a CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA) (Nuyttens et al. 2006 ), but has also been suggested to be possible with synchronized movement of multi-leaf collimators (Keall et al. 2005) . Respiratory gating and tracking are potentially less demanding on a patient compared with the breath-hold techniques.",

Amifostine is believed to scavenge harmful free radicals produced by the interaction of ionizing radiation and water molecules. Multiple randomized studies and a meta-analysis (Sasse et al. 2006 ) have tested the utility of amifostine in patients receiving RT for lung cancer with conflicting results (Table 9 ). The largest study was performed by the RTOG (Movsas et al. 2005) . The incidence of grade C3 esophagitis, the primary endpoint of the study, was 30% with amifostine versus 34% without (p = 0.9). The incidence of grade C3 pulmonary toxicity was lower in patients receiving amifostine (9 vs. 16%), but this was not statistically significant. This study has been criticized since the drug was given once daily (4 days/week) and the RT was given twice daily (5 days/week), and thus 60% of the RT fractions were delivered without the protector. Conversely, there are several single-institutional randomized trials suggesting protection with amifostine, in which the drug was used during a larger fraction of radiation treatments (Table 9 ). Presently, given the acute toxicity associated with amifostine (nausea/vomiting, hypotension, infection, rash), and the mixed clinical results, amifostine is not currently utilized widely for patients receiving thoracic RT.",

However, it did seem to facilitate late recovery in perfusion compared to rats receiving RT alone. In contrast, Stelzer et al. (1996) showed that rats receiving pentoxifylline maintained higher perfusion ratios than irradiated controls during weeks 3-5. However, the protection was transient and subsequent recovery from lung injury was inhibited at later times.

In particular, there were decreased perfusion defects, decreased chest X-ray abnormalities, and smaller decline in DLCO in patients receiving pentoxifylline. Additional study of this approach may be warranted.",

Symptomatic improvement after steroid therapy was first reported by Cosgriff and Kligerman (1951) , who noted that although the acute symptoms rapidly abated, fibrosis eventually developed. There are no robust studies assessing the optimal corticosteroid or dosing schedule, though it has been observed that symptoms may recur with a rapid taper or when corticosteroids, prescribed for other reasons, are discontinued after completion of RT (Castellino et al. 1974) . We recommend oral prednisone (Salinas and Winterbauer 1995) , typically 40-60 mg daily for 1-2 weeks, followed by a slow taper (reducing *10 mg every 1-2 weeks). It must be remembered that there is a differential diagnosis for shortness of breath occurring after RT. This includes tumor progression, drug toxicity, cardiac disease, pulmonary embolus, anemia, and infection. Since steroids can exacerbate an infection, an initial short course of antibiotics may be considered. The majority of patients with pneumonitis recover. However, symptoms can be serious enough to require oxygen or hospitalization, and can be potentially fatal.",

However, as our understanding of the physiology of radiation-induced fibrosis has increased, several pharmacologic agents have been evaluated and some have shown some promise in reversing subcutaneous fibrosis, which may be relevant to fibrosis in the lung. Such agents have included corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, alphatocopherol, hyperbaric oxygen, superoxide dismutase, angiotensin-converting enzymes, and combined pentoxifylline and alpha-tocopherol (Delanian and Lefaix 2007) . After promising results were obtained in a phase II study (Delanian et al. 1999) , performed a randomized study in which 24 women with breast cancer and superficial RTinduced fibrosis were randomized to pentoxifylline (800 mg/day) and alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E, 1000 U/ day), pentoxifylline plus placebo, alpha-tocopherol plus placebo, or double placebo (Delanian et al. 2003) . Treatment was continued for 6 months. There was a significant reduction in both fibrotic surface regression (60 vs. 43%, p = 0.04) and volume regression as based by ultrasound (73 vs. 51%, p = 0.054), comparing the combined treatment arm with the control arm. Neither pentoxifylline alone nor alpha-tocopherol alone was effective. Interestingly, there was a marked decrease in fibrosis in the double placebo arm. Another agent that has shown preliminary promise is liposomal superoxide dismutase. In a preclinical study (Lefaix et al. 1996) , this agent has been shown to reverse RT-induced fibrosis with regeneration of normal tissue in the previously fibrotic region. A single arm clinical study has also been reported (Delanian et al. 1994) . Patients (n = 34) with palpable radiation-induced fibrosis were treated with 3 weeks of liposomal Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. All patients showed some clinical regression within weeks of initiation of treatment. Though promising, further study is necessary to confirm these findings. Currently there are no widely accepted treatments for lung fibrosis and management continues to be entirely supportive.",

Indeed, in several studies, the ability to predict for RTinduced lung injury is improved in patients without large central or occluding tumors.

However, this study has been criticized because the drug was administered once daily (4 days/week), whereas the RT was delivered twice daily (5 days/week), and thus 60% of the RT fractions were delivered without the protector. Such mixed results, combined with the acute toxicities of amifostine (nausea/vomiting, hypotension, infection, and rash), have dissuaded many from using it in routine practice.

Primitive X-ray machines were limited by their low energy, and were consequently only able to treat superficial tumors effectively (Bernier et al. 2004 ). Initially, most tumors were managed with only a few relatively large doses of RT. Although reasonable tumor control was achieved, it was noted that fibrosis often developed in surrounding soft tissues (Evans and Leucutia 1925; Tyler and Blackman 1922) . Pulmonary and pleural reactions were, as expected, seldom observed (Evans and Leucutia 1925) . Technological advances in the early twentieth century allowed deeper-seated tumors to be treated. The effects of RT on normal tissues deep to the skin surface were subsequently noted. In 1921, Groover et al. (1922) reported the following to the Southern Medical Association:",
