We also investigated which \u03b14\u03b21-integrin ligands expressed by endothelial cells are implicated. The blockade of VCAM-1 did not protect against autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and only partly decreased the CD8 + T-cell infiltration into the CNS. In addition, inhibition of junctional adhesion molecule-B expressed by CNS endothelial cells also decreases CD8 T-cell infiltration. CD8 T cells may use additional and possibly unidentified adhesion molecules to gain access to the CNS.",

Under inflammatory conditions, either due to autoimmune responses or infection, the inflamed blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelium upregulates the expression of adhesion molecules (selectins and cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily). Several surface molecules expressed by CD4 T cells, such as P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, \u03b1L\u03b22, \u03b14\u03b21, CD6, or \u03b16\u03b21, regulate sequential steps for transmigration that include tethering, rolling, capture, firm adhesion, and finally diapedesis of bloodborne circulating T cells across the endothelial layer [4] . Antigen recognition in the subarachnoidal spaces then allow T cells to migrate through the glia limitans superficialis into the CNS parenchyma, leading to clinical disease [5] . In this scenario, a pivotal role for the interaction between the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin heterodimer expressed by activated T helper 1 CD4 cells, and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), its main ligand on BBB endothelial cells, has been demonstrated [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, as Th17 CD4 cells were shown to infiltrate the brain in the absence of \u03b14integrin in an \u03b1L\u03b22-dependent manner [10, 11] , \u03b14-independent routes to the CNS exist for other crucial T-cell subsets.",

Interaction between P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and P-selectin contributes to the recruitment of human CD8 T cells in brain vessels [15] . CD8 T-cell migration is not affected by blocking interactions between \u03b1L\u03b22/ICAM-1, ALCAM/CD6, PECAM-1/PECAM-1, or CCL2/CCR2, while all of them were previously shown to partake in the recruitment of other immune cell populations to the CNS [16, 17] . The conflicting results about neutralization of \u03b14-integrin in EAE and in coronavirus-induced encephalitis, restricting or not CD8 T-cell infiltration of the CNS, suggest that these cells may use alternative and possibly unidentified adhesion molecules to gain access to the CNS, raising the potential for selective control of their trafficking into the brain [10, 17, 18] . Using a murine model of CNS autoimmunity, the aim of our study was to define the role of \u03b14-integrins in the CD8 T-cell migration across the BBB during neuroinflammation, and to specify which of the heterodimers containing the \u03b14-integrin subunit, namely \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b14\u03b27, is implicated.",

Because there is no mAb against the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin heterodimer, we used an in vitro binding assay to indirectly show that in vitro differentiated cytotoxic HA-specific CD8 T cells express the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin heterodimer. While HA-specific CD8 T cells untreated or treated with a control IgG bind to recombinant ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, an anti-\u03b14-integrin mAb completely inhibited binding to VCAM-1 (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.00001), but did not affect binding to ICAM-1 (Fig. 1B) . As VCAM-1 is the main ligand of the \u03b14\u03b21integrin heterodimer, this suggests that HA-specific CD8 T cells express the functional \u03b14\u03b21-integrin heterodimer.",

Therefore, we treated CamK-HA recipients with an anti-\u03b14-integrin or a control IgG at day 0, 4, and 8 after the adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 10 6 cytotoxic HA-specific CD8 T cells. Compared to recipients receiving the control IgG, CamK-HA recipients treated by anti-\u03b14-integrin mAb lost less weight (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.0001) and showed no death (0/10 versus 5/10, Log-rank test, p = 0.006). In addition, survivors experienced less diabetes insipidus (2/10 versus 4/5) (Fig. 1C-E) . Since \u03b14-integrin is a subunit shared by both \u03b14\u03b21and \u03b14\u03b27-integrin heterodimers, we then investigated which one is involved in CD8 T-cell migration into the CNS. Currently no mAb is available that specifically recognizes the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin heterodimer, while the DATK32 mAb recognizes and blocks specifically the \u03b14\u03b27-integrin heterodimer [7] . We therefore treated CamK-HA recipients with this anti-\u03b14\u03b27integrin mAb. Recipients underwent the same clinical phenotype as mice receiving the control mAb. Indirectly, this strongly suggests that the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin is the essential heterodimer for activated CD8 T-cell migration into the CNS in our model. However, \u03b14-integrin blockade did not fully abrogate the neurological signs induced by HA-specific CD8 T-cell transfer in CamK-HA mice as significant weight loss developed when compared to control littermates (Fig. 1C) , and central diabetes insipidus was detected in 20% of treated recipients.",

Flow cytometry analysis of CNS-infiltrating cells from CamK-HA recipients 8 days after the adoptive transfer revealed a significant reduction in the number of transferred CD45.1 + CD8 T cells in mice treated with anti-VCAM-1 mAbs compared to mice receiving the control IgG (7990 \u00b1 1862 versus 14 331 \u00b1 1582 cells, Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.01; Fig. 3E ).

Indeed, CNS microvascular endothelial cells express JAM-B in addition to PECAM-1 (Fig. 4) . We investigated whether JAM-B could be potential ligand for \u03b14\u03b21-integrin expressed on CD8 T cells. We treated CamK-HA recipients with an anti-JAM-B mAb at day 0, 4, and 8 after the adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 10 6 cytotoxic HA-specific CD8 T cells. While CamK-HA recipients treated by the anti-JAM-B mAb displayed significantly less weight loss compared to recipients treated by control IgG or anti-VCAM-1 mAbs, they displayed the same incidence of diabetes insipidus and death ( Fig. 3A-C) . Flow cytometry analysis of the CNS of CamK-HA recipients treated by anti-JAM-B mAb showed a significant decrease in the number of infiltrating CD45.1 + CD8 transferred cells compared to mice receiving the control IgG (7016 \u00b1 2029 versus 14 331 \u00b1 1582 cells/CNS, Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.017; Fig. 3E ). This decrease was similar to that achieved when blocking VCAM-1 (Mann-Whitney test, ns), but clearly inferior to the inhibition achieved by the anti-\u03b14-integrin mAb (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0017; Fig. 3E ). Increased dose of anti-JAM-B mAb did not improve the reduction of CNS-infiltrating CD45.1 + CD8 + transferred cells, suggesting that saturating concentrations of the antibody were obtained (Supporting Information Fig. 3 ). Therefore, JAM-B expressed by BBB endothelial cells might represent a ligand for \u03b14\u03b21-integrin-mediated migration of CD8 T cells into the CNS. In order to test the hypothesis that VCAM-1 and JAM-B are complementary ligands for \u03b14\u03b21-integrin, we treated recipients with both anti-JAM-B and anti-VCAM-1 mAbs. Coadministration of both mAbs did not demonstrate a synergistic reduction in the number of CNS-infiltrated CD45.1 + CD8 transferred T cells (Fig. 3E) . We finally investigated the phenotype of CD8 T cells that entered the CNS of CamK-HA recipients after blockade of \u03b14integrin, \u03b14\u03b27-integrin, VCAM-1, or JAM-B.

Using a murine model of CNS autoimmune neuroinflammation, we showed that the migration of cytotoxic CD8 T cells to the CNS relies on the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin heterodimer. We also showed that VCAM-1 and JAM-B expressed by BBB endothelial cells are likely implicated in this process, but that their inhibition is insufficient to completely block CD8 T-cell infiltration into the CNS or to mitigate the clinical encephalomyelitis signs.",

            "text": "Two studies using animal models of neuroinflammation and in vitro transmigration assays demonstrated that blocking the \u03b14-integrin decreases migration of CD8 T cells across CNS vascular structures [17, 18] . However, because the \u03b14-integrin is common to \u03b14\u03b21and \u03b14\u03b27-integrin heterodimers [22] , it is unknown which one is implicated. Our model showed that blockade of \u03b14-integrin, but not of the \u03b14\u03b27-integrin heterodimer, prevents encephalomyelitis and tissue damage by interfering with cytotoxic CD8 T-cell entry into the CNS. These results strongly suggest that the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin is the essential heterodimer for the interaction of activated CD8 T cells with the BBB. Similarly, blocking \u03b14-integrin can abrogate the development of EAE mediated by encephalitogenic CD4 Th1 cells [7] [8] [9] [10] . Those cells critically rely on \u03b21integrin to accumulate in the CNS during EAE [6] . Moreover, blocking the \u03b14\u03b27-integrin heterodimer fails to inhibit EAE development in mice and Rhesus monkeys [7, 23] , and ectopic expression of the \u03b14\u03b27-integrin ligand MAdCAM-1 in CNS endothelial cells fails to trigger CNS recruitment of \u03b14\u03b27-expressing T cells [24] . Thus, \u03b14\u03b21-integrin rather than \u03b14\u03b27-integrin mediates both CD4 and CD8 T-cell interaction with CNS endothelium. However, as \u03b14-integrin blockade did not totally abrogate clinical signs and CNS infiltration of transferred CD8 T cells in our model, an \u03b14\u03b21-independent route, although accessory, remains operative. Its molecular bases are still to be determined.",

            "text": "The most studied brain endothelial ligand for \u03b14\u03b21-integrin is VCAM-1 [20] . VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed at low level on the BBB endothelium, and mediates both the initial capture and the subsequent G-protein-dependent arrest of CD4 Th1 cells upon interaction with the \u03b14\u03b21-integrin [8] . Expression of VCAM-1 is upregulated in inflammatory conditions on endothelial cells of the BBB and of the blood-leptomeningeal barrier, as well as on choroid plexus epithelium of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, further increasing \u03b14\u03b21/VCAM-1-mediated T-cell adhesion to inflamed CNS endothelium [25, 26] . It was previously shown that VCAM-1 blockade inhibits clinical or histopathological signs of EAE mediated by encephalitogenic CD4 Th1 cells [7] . In a model of OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes infection, access of OVA-specific CD8 T cells to the CNS was inhibited by the antibody-mediated blockade of VCAM-1 to the same extent as did the \u03b14-integrin blockade [18] . Unexpectedly, blockade of VCAM-1 in our model only had a partial effect on CD8 T-cell migration to the CNS, as the number of CNS-infiltrated CD8 T cells was reduced by 46% compared to mice treated by the control IgG (Fig. 3D ). This decrease was not clinically relevant as recipients treated with different clones of anti-VCAM-1 mAb experienced weight loss, death, and diabetes insipidus to the same extent as mice treated by the control IgG. Therefore, VCAM-1 blockade was not sufficient in our model to inhibit \u03b14\u03b21-expressing CD8 T-cells migration into the CNS. Several differences between our study and that of Young et al. [18] might explain those discordant results, including the genetic background of the mice, BALB/c or (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL6) F1 versus C57BL6/J, the localization of the HA and OVA antigens in different cells, neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, and the state of differentiation of the encephalitogenic CD8 T cells (terminally differentiated highly cytotoxic versus shortly activated CD8 T cells). Moreover, the L. monocytogenes infection within the CNS in this model might induce additional triggers including increased expression of VCAM-1 at the BBB, allowing for increased VCAM-1-dependence of CD8 T-cell migration into the CNS. It was suggested that natalizumab, a humanized mAb against the human \u03b14 subunit of \u03b14\u03b21-integrin and \u03b14\u03b27, might also affect CD4 and CD8 T-cell expression of \u03b14-integrinunrelated molecules such as CD62L, CXCR3, and \u03b1L\u03b22 in longterm treated natalizumab patients [27, 28] . Here, we have used a very short treatment. In addition, the high specificity of PS/2 for the murine \u03b14-integrin subunit makes this antibody unlikely to cross-react with other integrin subunit or unrelated molecules such as selectins. Indeed, PS/2 recognizes the functional epitope B2 on the \u03b14-integrin subunit and was shown to specifically block \u03b14\u03b21-mediated lymphocyte binding to VCAM-1 and fibronectin as well as \u03b14\u03b27-dependent binding to VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 in vitro [29, 30] . Another explanation could be that, in our model, VCAM-1 is not the sole, or even not the main, ligand for \u03b14\u03b21integrin.",

At least two additional vascular ligands have been described, the CS1 domain of a spliced variant of fibronectin [31, 32] , and JAM-B [21, 33] . Since no reliable blocking antibody against CS1 domain is currently available, the role of fibronectin in the migration process of CD8 T cells could not be explored yet. Because \u03b14\u03b21-JAM-B interaction has only been investigated in vitro or in vivo in skin microvasculature [21] , and because JAM-B is expressed by the BBB in our model, we focused on this putative ligand for CD8 T-cell migration to the CNS. Members of the classical JAM family are transmembrane type 1 proteins with two immunoglobulin domains highly expressed in cells that present well organized tight junctions, such as the endothelium of the BBB [34] . JAM-A, interacting with \u03b1L\u03b22-integrin, is implicated in cell migration to the CNS. A blocking mAb directed to JAM-A significantly inhibited leukocyte infiltration in the CSF and the brain parenchyma in a model of cytokine-induced meningitis [35] . However, those results were not confirmed in infectious meningitis [36] . JAM-B plays a central role in the regulation of paracellular permeability [34] , but also impacts T-cell rolling and firm adhesion [21] . Although a lack of JAM-B expression at steady state on brain endothelial cells was suggested [37] , we show that JAM-B is expressed on brain endothelial cells in our murine model of CNS autoimmunity. Because blockade of JAM-B was associated to a partial protection against encephalomyelitis and a significant reduction in the number of infiltrated CD8 T cells, however to a lesser extent than \u03b14\u03b21-integrin blockade, our data suggest that JAM-B participates to the CD8 T-cell migration process to the CNS.",

            "text": "The discovery of the role of \u03b14\u03b21-VCAM-1 interaction in T-cell migration to the CNS led to the development of natalizumab, which has proven to be highly beneficial in relapsingremitting MS [38] . Unfortunately, natalizumab is associated with an increased risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic disease of the CNS caused by John Cunningham (JC) virus infection of oligodendrocytes [39] . Development of PML following natalizumab therapy likely relies on a multifactorial scenario including permissiveness for active JC virus replication and impaired immune surveillance [40] [41] [42] [43] . Compared with untreated MS patients, natalizumab treatment induces a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid CD4 and CD8 T cells [44, 45] . Because CD4 and CD8 T cells are crucial in controlling JC virus reactivation and dissemination [46, 47] , our results suggest that development of PML is, at least in part, due to natalizumab-mediated inhibition of CNS immunosurveillance by JC virus-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, natalizumab-associated PML in MS patients is often complicated after natalizumab withdrawal by IRIS, darkening again the prognosis [48] . Although CD4 T cells might participate [49] , a clear dominance of CD8 T cells in CNS-infiltrates has been observed in natalizumab-associated PML-IRIS occurring in patients with MS [50] , reminiscent of the PML-IRIS pathology described in HIV-infected patients [51] . This indirectly supports the idea that the discontinuation of natalizumab allows migration of CD8 T cell to the CNS.",

The CamK-iCre [53] and the Rosa26 tm(HA)1Lib [54] mice have been described previously. CamK-HA mice were obtained by crossing the CamK-iCre transgenic mice with the Rosa26 tm(HA)1Lib mice [19] . Cre-mediated genomic DNA recombination and the resulting transcription of HA occurred only in CamK-HA mice and were confined to the brain and spinal cord [19] . Mice were backcrossed at least six times on the BALB/c background. In some experiments, to benefit from a congenic marker allowing the distinction between transferred HA-specific CD8 T cells (CD45.1) and recipient T cells (CD45.2), donor and recipient mice on a (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL6) F1 background were used. Of note, the number of T cells infiltrating the CNS of CamK-HA mice did not differ between the BALB/c and the (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL6) F1 backgrounds (Supporting Information Fig. 4 ). All mice were 6-9-week-old at the onset of the experiments. Mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. This study was carried out in strict accordance with EU regulations and with the recommendations of the French national chart for ethics of animal experiments (articles R 214-87-90 of the \"Code rural\"). The protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the r\u00e9gion Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (permit numbers: 04-U563-DG-06 and MP/18/26/04/04).

Subsequently, sections were dried for 30 min at room temperature. Blocking solution, skimmed milk (5% in TBS) was incubated for 20 min. Primary rat-antimouse CD8 antibody (Lyt 2, eBiosciences) and secondary goat-antirat IgG-Cy3 antibody (eBiosciences) were diluted in blocking solution. Antibody incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature. To visualize the cell nuclei, DAPI (0.5 \u03bcg/mL, Invitrogen D3571) was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Sections were washed with TBS between incubation steps and finally mounted with Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse 600 fluorescence microscope.",

(A-C) Immunofluorescence staining for JAM-B in the mouse CNS was evaluated on cryosections (6 \u03bcm) of brains of CamK-HA mice day 8 after adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 10 6 cytotoxic HA-specific CD8 T cells. Double immunofluorescence staining of JAM-B (A) and PECAM-1 (B) show colocalization of JAM-B and PECAM-1 staining (C) on all vessels in the mouse cortex. Arrowheads point to representable JAM-B positive (A) and JAM-B/PECAM-1 double positive vessels (C). (D-F) Double immunofluorescence staining of JAM-B (D, arrowheads) and VCAM-1 (E) show a colocalization of JAM-B and VCAM-1 (F) on blood vessels (arrowhead), however JAM-B immune staining can additionally be detected on endothelial cells staining negative for VCAM-1. (F) Arrowheads with stars point to JAM-B positive vessels that do not stain positive for VCAM-1. (G-I) Isotype control staining with rabbit IgG control antibody (G) and PECAM-1 (H) shows no staining for the rabbit IgG (G and I). The variability in background with the anti-JAM-B antibody observed in (A), (D), and (J)is related to the area in the CNS and the inflammatory status of the brain.
