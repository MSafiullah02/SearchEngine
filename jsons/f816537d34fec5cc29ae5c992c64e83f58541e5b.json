The first is to explain the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths. The second is to suggest a strategy to cope with future epidemic threats having accelerated viral infectivity in society. Using data on N=55 Italian province capitals, and data of infected individuals at as of April 7 th , 2020, results reveal that the accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities measured with days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) or ozone in previous years. In particular, hinterland cities with average higher number of days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (and a low intensity of wind speed) have a very high number of infected people on 7 th April, 2020 (arithmetic mean about 2,200 infected, with average polluted days greater than 80), than coastal cities also having days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 or ozone but with high intensity of wind speed (arithmetic mean about 944.70 infected individuals, with about 60 average polluted days); moreover, cities having more than 100 days of air pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM10), they have a very high average number of infected people (about 3,350 infected individuals, 7 th April 2020), whereas cities having less than 100 days of air pollution, they have a lower average number of infected individuals (about 1014). The findings here also suggest that to minimize the impact of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which Italian provincial capitals can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological conditions, is about 48 days. Moreover, results here reveal that the explanatory variable of air pollution in cities under study seems to be a more important predictor in the initial phase of diffusion (on 17 th March 2020, b1 = 1.27, p<0.001) than interpersonal contacts (b2 = 0.31, p<0.05). In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7 th April, 2020 with b'1 = .81, p<0.001) also because of indirect effect of lockdown, whereas coefficient of transmission by interpersonal contacts has stability (b'2 = 0.31, p<0.01). This result reveals that accelerated transmissions dynamics of COVID-19 is due to mainly to the mechanism of \"air pollution-to-human transmission\" rather than \"human-to-human transmission\". Overall, then, transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc.) and specific factors which are different for each region (e.g., complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, etc.). Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study of Italy suggest that a proactive strategy to cope with future epidemics is to also apply especially an environmental and sustainable policy based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in hinterland and polluting cities\uf02d having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog days\uf02dthat seem to have an environment that may damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. Hence, in the presence of polluting industrialization in regions that can trigger the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 has to be also designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that is also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in terms of biology, healthcare and health sector.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 1 | P a g e", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The complex problem of viral infectivity of COVID-19 is analyzed here in a perspective of reductionist approach, considering the geo-environmental and demographic factors that we study to explain the relationships supporting the transmission dynamics of this viral infectivity (cf., Linstone, 1999) .

In the phase of the maturity of transmission dynamics (7 th April, 2020), with lockdown that reduces air pollution, the mechanism of the air pollution-to-human transmission reduces intensity whereas human-to-human transmission increases.

Note: This result reveals that transmissions dynamics of COVID-19 is due to two mechanisms given by: human-to-human transmission (density of population) and air pollution-to-human transmission; in particular, in polluting cities the accelerated diffusion of viral infectivity is also due to mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission that may be stronger than human-to-human transmission ! Table 11 shows results of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 considering the interpersonal contacts, measured with density of population in cities understudy. In short, results suggest that density of population explains the number of infected individuals, increasing the probability of human-to-human transmission. However, if we decompose the sample to consider the cities with \uf0a3100 days exceeding limits set for PM 10 or ozone and with >100 days exceeding limits set for PM 10 or ozone, then the expected increase of number of infected individuals is higher in cities having more than 100 days exceeding limits set for PM 10 or ozone.

Figure 3 shows COVID-19 outbreak in North Italy with number of infected and days exceeding the limits set for PM 10 or for ozone. Statistical analyses for N=55 Italian provincial capitals confirm the significant association between high diffusion of viral infectivity and air pollution. Studies show that the diffusion of viral infectivity depends on the interplay between host factors and environment (Neu and Mainou, 2020) . In this context, it is critical to understand how air quality can affect viral dissemination at national and global level (Das and Horton, 2017) . Many ecological studies have examined the association between the incidence of invasive pneumococcal Journal Pre-proof disease, respiratory virus circulation and various climatic factors (McCullers, 2006; Jansen et al., 2008) . These studies show that in temperate climates, the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease has a peak incidence in winter months (Dowell et al., 2003; Kim et al., 1996; Talbot et al. 2005) . Journal Pre-proof argue that, in addition to climate factors, the health effects of air pollution have been subject to intense investigations in recent years. Air pollution is ubiquitous in manifold urban areas of developed and developing nations. Air pollution has gaseous components and particulate matter (PM). The former includes ozone (O 3 ), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) that generate inflammatory stimuli on the respiratory tract of individuals (Glencross et al., 2020) . Of these pollutants, PM has a complex composition that includes metals, elemental carbon and organic carbon (both in hydrocarbons and peptides), sulphates and nitrates, etc. (Ghio et al., 2012; Wooding et al., 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 523, "end": 545, "text": "(Neu and Mainou, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 670, "end": 692, "text": "(Das and Horton, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 882, "end": 899, "text": "(McCullers, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 900, "end": 920, "text": "Jansen et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1079, "text": "(Dowell et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1097, "text": "Kim et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1117, "text": "Talbot et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1651, "text": "(Glencross et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1847, "text": "(Ghio et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1869, "text": "Wooding et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 129, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Why did this Coronavirus spread so rapidly in Italy?"}, {"text": "Advanced countries, such as in Europe, have more and more smog because of an unexpected temperature inversion, which traps polluting emissions from the city near ground-level in winter.

The exposure to pollutants, such as airborne particulate matter and ozone, generates respiratory and cardiovascular diseases with increases in mortality and hospital admissions (cf., Langrish and Mills, 2014) . Wei et al.

Studies show that during heavy aerosol pollution in Beijing (China), 50%-70% of bacterial aerosols are in sub micrometer particles, 0.56-1 mm (Zhang et al., 2019; cf., Zhang et al., 2016) . As bacteria size typically ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 mm (Despr\u00e9s et al., 2012) , they can form clumps or attach to particles and transport regionally between terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric and artificial ecosystems (Smets et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 323, "text": "Bell et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 509, "end": 534, "text": "Langrish and Mills, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 537, "end": 554, "text": "Wei et al.

Harmful bio aerosol components\uf02dincluding pathogens, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and endotoxins\uf02dcan cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in society (Charmi et al., 2018) . In fact, the concentration of microbes, pathogens and toxic components significantly increases during polluted days, compared to no polluted days (Liu et Journal Pre-proof al., 2018) . In addition, airborne bacterial community structure changes with pollutant concentration, which may be related to bacterial sources and multiplication in the air (Zhang et al., 2019) . Studies also indicate that microbial community composition and bioactivity are significantly affected by particle concentration . To put it differently, the atmospheric particulate matter harbors more microbes during polluted days than sunny or clean days (Wei et al., 2016) . These studies can explain one of the driving factors of higher viral infectivity of in the industrialized regions of Nord Italy, rather than in other part of Italy (Tables 1-6 ). In fact, viable bio aerosol particles and high microbial concentration in particulate matter play their non-negligible role during air pollution and transmission of viral infectivity (Zhang et al., 2019) . For instance, studies on airborne bacteria in PM 2.5 from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions in China revealed that air pollutants are main factors in shaping bacterial community structure . Xie et al. (2018) indicate that total bacteria concentration is higher in moderately polluted air than in clean or heavily polluted air. Liu et al. (2018) show that bacterial concentration is low in moderately or heavily pollution in PM 2.5 and PM 10 , whereas the pathogenic bacteria concentration is very high in heavy and moderate pollution. Sun et al. (2018) study bacterial community during low and high particulate matter (PM) pollution and find out that predominant species varied with PM concentration. In general, bio aerosol concentrations are influenced by complex factors, such as emission sources, terrain, meteorological conditions and other climate factors (Zhai et al., 2018) . Wei et al. (2020) also investigate the differences between inland and coastal cities in China (Jinan and Weihai, respectively) to explain the influence of topography, meteorological conditions and geophysical factors on bio aerosol. Results suggest that from clean days to high polluted days, bacterial community structure is influenced by bacterial adaptation to pollutants, chemical composition of pollutants and meteorological conditions (cf., Sun et al., 2018) . Moreover, certain bacteria from Proteobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus have high tolerance towards environmental stresses and can adapt to extreme environments. As a matter of fact, bacilli can survive to harsh environments by forming spores. Moreover, certain bacteria with protective mechanisms can survive in highly polluted environments, while other bacteria cannot withstand such extreme conditions. In particular, bacteria in the atmosphere to survive must withstand and adapt to ultraviolet exposure, reduced nutrient availability, desiccation, extreme temperatures and other factors. In short, in the presence of Journal Pre-proof accumulated airborne pollutants, more microorganisms might be attached to particulate matter. Thus, in heavy or severe air pollution, highly toxic pollutants in PM 2.5 and PM 10 may inhibit microbial growth. Numerous studies also indicate the combination between meteorological conditions and air pollution creates appropriate environment for microbial community structure and abundance, and viral infectivity (Jones and Harrison, 2004) .

In moderate pollution, PM 2.5 might harbor abundant bacteria, especially genera containing opportunistic pathogens. Therefore, effective measures should control health risks caused by bio aerosols during air pollution, especially for immunocompromised, elderly and other fragile individuals. This study may support the results here and explain the high mortality in Italy because of COVID-19 of certain individuals having previous pathologies: in fact, the percentage of deaths compared to the total of those who tested positive for COVID-19 in Italy is of about 80% in individuals aged > 70 years with comorbidities as of April 7 th , 2020 (Istituto Superiore Sanit\u00e0, 2020; cf., WHO, 2020c) .

Especially, current evidence indicates that PM 10 increases cough, lower respiratory symptoms and lower peak expiratory flow (Ward and Ayres, Journal Pre-proof Nel, 2005) . Weinmayr et al. (2010) provide strong evidence that PM 10 may be an aggravating factor of asthma in children. Furthermore, asthma symptoms are exacerbated by air pollutants, such as diesel exhaust, PM 10 , NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 and respiratory virus, such as adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (Jaspers et al., 2005; Murdoch and Jennings, 2009; Murphy et al., 2000; Wong et al., 2009) . The study by Liao et al. (2011) confirms that exacerbations of asthma have been associated with bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections and air pollution. Some studies have focused on the effect of meteorology and air pollution on acute viral respiratory infections and viral bronchiolitis (a disease linked to seasonal changes in respiratory viruses) in the first years of life (Nenna et al., 2017; S\u00e9gala et al., 2008; Vandini et al., 2013 Vandini et al., , 2015 . Carugno et al. (2018) analyze respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the primary cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children: bronchiolitis. Results suggest that seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seem to influence RSV-related bronchiolitis epidemics in Italian urban areas. In fact, airborne particulate matter (PM) may influence the children's immune system and foster the spread of RSV infection. This study also shows a correlation between short-and medium-term PM 10 exposures and increased risk of hospitalization because of RSV bronchiolitis among infants. In short, manifold environmental factors\uf02dsuch as air pollution levels, circulation of respiratory viruses and colder temperatures\uf02dinduce in longer periods of time spent indoors with higher opportunities for diffusion of infections between people. In fact, the high diffusion of viral infectivity by COVID-19 in North of Italy is in winter period (February-March, 2020) . Studies also show that air pollution is higher during winter months and it has been associated with increased hospitalizations for respiratory diseases (Ko et al., 2007a; Medina-Ram\u00f3n et al., 2006) . Moreover, oscillations in temperature and humidity may lead to changes in the respiratory epithelium, which increased susceptibility to infection (Deal et al., 1980) . Murdoch and Jennings (2009) correlate the incidence rate of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) with fluctuations in respiratory virus activity and environmental factors in New Zealand, showing how incidence rates of IPD are associated with the increased activity of some respiratory viruses and air pollution. Another side effect of air pollution exposure is the association with the incidence of mumps. Hao et al. (2019) show that exposure to NO 2 and SO 2 is significantly associated with higher risk of developing mumps. Instead, Yang et al. (2020) show that the exposure of people to SO 2 , NO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 and PM 2.5 Journal Pre-proof (i.e., air pollution) is associated with hand, foot, and mouth diseases. Moreover, the effect of air pollution in the cold season is higher than in the warm season. Shepherd and Mullins (2019) have also analyzed the relationship between arthritis diagnosis in those over 50 and exposure to extreme air pollution in utero or infancy. Results link early-life air pollution exposure to later-life arthritis diagnoses, and suggest a particularly strong link for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 3 . Sheperd and Mullins (2019) also argue that exposure to smog and air pollution in the first year of life is associated with a higher incidence of arthritis later in life.

A vast literature shows short-term effects of air pollution on health, but air pollution affects morbidity also in the long run . The mechanism of damages of air pollution on health can be explained as follows. Air pollutants exert their own specific individual toxic effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of people; in addition, ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and suspended particulates have a common property of being potent oxidants, either through direct effects on lipids and proteins or indirectly through the activation intracellular oxidant pathways (Rahman and MacNee, 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 732, "end": 757, "text": "(Rahman and MacNee, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Air pollution, immune system and genetic damages"}, {"text": "Animal and human in-vitro and in-vivo exposure studies have demonstrated the powerful oxidant capacity of inhaled ozone with activation of stress signaling pathways in epithelial cells (Bayram et al., 2001) and resident alveolar inflammatory cells (Mochitate et al., 2001) .

The respiratory mucosa consists of respiratory tract lining fluids; bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells; tissue resident immune cells such as alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells and granulocytes; as well as adaptive memory T and B lymphocytes.

In particular, immune system consists of multiple types of immune cell that act together to generate (or fail to generate) immune responses. In this context, the explanation of relationships between ambient pollutants and immune system is vital to explain how pollution causes disease. Glencross et al. (2020) show that air pollutants can affect different immune cell types, such as particle-clearing macrophages, inflammatory neutrophils, dendritic cells that orchestrate adaptive immune responses and lymphocytes that enact those responses. In general, air pollutants stimulate pro-inflammatory immune responses across multiple classes of immune cell. In particular, the association between high ambient pollution and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is consistent with immunological mechanisms. In fact, diseases can result from inadequate responses to infectious microbes allowing fulminant infections, inappropriate/excessive immune responses to microbes leading to more collateral damages than the microbe itself, and inappropriate immune responses to self/environment, such as seems to be in the case of COVID-19. Glencross et al. (2020) also discuss evidence that air pollution can cause disease by perturbing multicellular immune responses. Studies confirm associations between elevated ambient particulate matter and worsening of lung function in patients with COPD (Bloemsma et al., 2026) , between COPD exacerbations and Journal Pre-proof both ambient particulate matter and ambient pollutant gasses (Li et al., 2026) and similarly for asthma exacerbations with high concentration of ambient pollutants (Orellano et al., 2017 , Zheng et al., 2015 . In short, the associations between ambient pollution and airways exacerbations are stronger than associations with development of chronic airways diseases. Glencross et al. (2020) also argue that ambient pollutants can directly trigger cellular signaling pathways, and both cell culture studies and animal models have shown profound effects of air pollutants on every type of immune cell studied. In addition, many of studies suggest an action of air pollution to augment Th2 immune responses and perturb antimicrobial immune responses. This mechanism also explains the association between high air pollution and increased exacerbations of asthma -a disease characterized by an underlying Th2 immuno-pathology in the airways with severe viral-induced exacerbations. Moreover, as inhaled air pollution deposits primarily on the respiratory mucosa, potential strategies to reduce such effects may be based on vitamin D supplementation. Studies show that plasma levels of vitamin D, activated by ultraviolet B, are significantly higher in summer and fall than winter and spring season, in a latitude-dependent manner (Barger-Lux and Heaney, 2002) . Since the temperature and hour of sun depend on latitude, Oh et al. (2010) argue that adequate activated vitamin D levels are also associated with diminished cancer risk and mortality in specific populations. (Lim et al., 2006; Grant, 2002) . For instance, breast cancer incidence correlates inversely with the levels of serum vitamin D and ultraviolet B exposure, which have the highest intensity in summer season. These relationships of vitamin D and cancer risk are not limited to breast cancer, but are also relevant to colon, prostate, endometrial, ovarian, and lung cancers (Zhou et al., 2005) . In the context of this study and considering the negative effects of air pollution on human health and transmission dynamics of viruses, summer season may have twofold effects to reduce diffusion of viral infectivity: 1) hot and sunny weather increases temperature and improves environment that can reduce air pollution, typically of winter period, and as result alleviate transmission of viral infectivity by COVID-19 (Ko et al., 2007a; Medina-Ram\u00f3n et al., 2006; Wei et al, 2020; Dowell et al., 2003; Kim et al., 1996; Talbot et al. 2005) ;", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 175, "text": "(Glencross et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 464, "end": 487, "text": "Glencross et al.

By January 23, 2020, Chinese authorities had shut down transportation going into and out of Wuhan, as well as local businesses, in order to reduce the spread of viral infectivity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Public Health England. 2020; Manuell and Cukor, 2011) . It is the beginning of several quarantines set up in China and other countries around the world to cope with transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease to ascertain if they become unwell, in order to reduce the risk of them infecting others (Brooks et al., 2019) . In short, quarantine can generate a strong reduction of the transmission of viral infectivity. In the presence of COVID-19 outbreak in North Italy, Italian government has applied the total quarantine and lockdown from 11 March, 2020 to 13 April, 2020 for all Italy, adding also some holidays thereafter. In fact, Italy was not able to prevent this complex problem of Coronavirus infection and has applied quarantine as a recovery strategy to lessen the health and socioeconomic damages caused by this pandemic. Millions of people have been quarantined for the first time in Italy and is one of the largest actions in the history of Italy. In addition, Italy applied non-pharmaceutical interventions based on physical distancing, school and store closures, workplace distancing, to avoid crowded places, similarly to measures applied to COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan (cf., Prem et al., 2020) .

In fact, following the COVID-19 outbreak, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) points out that the global economy may contract of about by 2.5% and Italy by -7% of real GDP growth % in 2020 (EIU, 2020). Italy and other advanced countries should introduce organizational, product and process innovations to cope with future viral threats, such as the expansion of hospital capacity and testing capabilities, to reduce diagnostic and health system delays also using artificial intelligence, new Information and communication technologies for alleviating and/or eliminating effective interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals, and finally of course to develop effective vaccines and antivirals that can counteract future global public health threat in the presence of new epidemics similar to COVID-19 Wilder-Smith et al 2020; Riou and Althaus, 2020; Yao et al., 2020; cf., Coccia, 2015 cf., Coccia, , 2017 cf., Coccia, , 2020 .

This study here shows that accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 is also likely associated with high air pollution and specific meteorological conditions (low wind speed, etc.) of North Italy and other Norther Italian regions that favor the transmission dynamics of viral infectivity. North Italy is one of the European regions with the highest motorization rate and polluting industrialization (cf., Legambiente, 2019) .

In 24 of the 55 Italian province capitals, the limit was exceeded for both parameters, with negative effects on population and subsequent health problems. In fact, the cities that last year passed the higher number of polluted days are Brescia and 33 for the ozone), followed by Genoa with 103 days, Avellino a city close to Naples in South Italy (with total 89 days: 46 for PM 10 and 43 for ozone) and Terni with 86 days (respectively 49 and 37 days for the two pollutants).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 488, "end": 510, "text": "Coccia and Wang, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 511, "end": 512, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1357, "text": "Wilder-Smith et al 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1381, "text": "Riou and Althaus, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1399, "text": "Yao et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1417, "text": "cf., Coccia, 2015", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1437, "text": "cf., Coccia, , 2017", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1457, "text": "cf., Coccia, , 2020", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1738, "text": "Coccia, 2016a", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1754, "text": "Coccia, , 2016b", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1769, "text": "Coccia, , 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2188, "text": "Legambiente, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PREVENT FUTURE EPIDEMICS SIMILAR TO COVID-19"}, {"text": "Many cities in Italy are affected by air pollution and smog because of traffic, domestic heating, industries and agricultural practices and with private cars that continue to be by far the most used means of transportation (more than 39 million cars in 2019).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PREVENT FUTURE EPIDEMICS SIMILAR TO COVID-19"}, {"text": "Mid-January 2020", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Journal Pre-proof"}, {"text": "Sources: European Space Agency, 2020.

In Italy, the first COVID-19 outbreak has been found in Codogno, a small city of the Lodi area, close to Milan. Although local lockdown on February 25, 2020, the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection showed concentrations of PM 10 beyond the limits in almost all of Lombardy region. The day after, February 26, 2020, the mistral wind and then the north wind swept the entire Journal Pre-proof Po valley, bringing to Lombardy region a substantial reduction in the average daily concentrations of PM 10 , which almost everywhere were lower than 50 micrograms of particulate matter/m 3 of air. Hence, high concentration of nitrogen dioxide, a noxious gas, particulate air pollutants emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities in North Italy seems to be a platform to support diffusion of viral infectivity (Groulx et al., 2018) , increase hospitalizations for respiratory virus bronchiolitis (cf., Carugno et al., 2018; Nenna et al., 2017) , increase asthma incidence (Liao et al., 2011) and damage the immune system of people (Glencross et al., 2020) . As a matter of fact, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 has found in air pollution and meteorological conditions of North Italy an appropriate environment and population to carry out an accelerated diffusion that is generation more than 17,000 deaths and a huge number of hospitalizations in a short period of time (February-March-April, 2020 ). instance, in Piedmont, one of the regions of North Italy also having a high COVID-19 diffusion, the concentration of air pollution since the beginning of March, 2020 has ever exceeded the limit values of PM 10 and has always remained below 50\u00b5g / m\u00b3 everywhere. Overall, then, the vital indirect effect of quarantine and lockdown of Italy and other European countries is a reduction in a short time of NO 2 and air pollution, improving the quality of environment that may reduce, associated with quarantine, physical distancing and other inter-related factors, the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. A study by Zhang et al. (2019a) shows that with the implementation of air policy in China, from 2013 to 2017, fine particle (PM 2.5 ) concentrations have significant declined nationwide with health benefits. A possible danger in future is that after the quarantine and lockdown, the industrial activity of industrialized regions in North Italy has to resume at an intense pace of production and in next winter-fall season Journal Pre-proof 2020-2021 there may be again the environmental and meteorological conditions that can lead to other diffusion waves of viral infectivity of COVID-19 and/or other dangerous viruses. Of course, non-physical distancing and other long-run factors play a critical part in mitigating transmission dynamics of future epidemic similar to COVID-19, in particular when measures of physical distancing, school and store closures, workplace distancing, prohibition for crowded places are relaxed. The suggested strategy that regions of North Italy has to apply, considering their geographical location and meteorological conditions with a high polluting industrialization, is to avoid to overcome the limits set of PM 10 and other pollutants, following more and more a sustainable pathways of growth. One of the findings here suggests that the max number of days per year that Italian provincial capitals can exceed the limits set for PM 10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) or for ozone, considering the meteorological condition has to be less than 50 days. Beyond this critical point, the study suggests that environmental inconsistencies because of the combination between air pollution and meteorological conditions trigger a take-off of viral infectivity (epidemic diffusion) with damages for health of population and economy in society. Italy must design and set up necessary measures to drastically reduce the concentrations of pollution present and improve air quality in cities. Italy has to respect Legislative Decree 155/2010 that establishes a maximum number of 35 days / year with concentrations higher than 50 \u03bcg / m 3 . As a matter of fact, the quarantine and other non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the impact of viral infectivity in the short term, but to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19, Italy and advanced nations have more and more to sustain a sustainable growth. The environmental policy to cope with future consequential coronavirus threats has to be also based on sustainable technologies that reduce air pollution improving the quality of air and environment for population (cf., Coccia, 2005 Coccia, , 2006 Coccia, , 2018 Coccia and Watts, 2020) . Italy must support, more and more, sustainable mobility as engine of socioeconomic change and redesign cities for people using an urban planning that improves public respiratory health. Moreover, in the presence of the association between air pollution, climate 5 and viral infectivity, Italy and other advanced nations have to reduce the motorization rate of polluting machines with a transition to new electric vehicles, generating a revolution in society. It is basic to encourage sustainable mobility, by enhancing local, urban and commuter public transport with electric vehicles and creating vast Low Emission Zones within cities. Italy and Europe have to launch a real sustainable growth roadmap with the aim of complete zero emissions in all socioeconomic systems. Some studies done in the past show the causality of the reduction of air pollution on health benefits. For instance, Pope (1989) describes the case of a labor dispute that shut down a large steel mill in the Utah Valley for 14 months in 1987. Toxicological studies of particulate matter collected before, during, and after the strike, in the Utah Valley case, provide strong evidence of a causal relation between exposure to ambient particulate matter, mortality and morbidity. Ambient particulate matter concentrations as well as respiratory hospital admissions were clearly decreased during the strike, increasing to prestrike levels after the dispute ended (Pope, 1989 ; cf., the reduction of mortality described by Pope, 1996) . Another example, it includes the reductions in acute-care visits and hospital admissions for asthma in Atlanta (GA, USA), in conjunction with reduced air pollution due to traffic restrictions taken during the 2000 Olympic games (Friedman, 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1007, "end": 1028, "text": "(Groulx et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1120, "text": "Carugno et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1140, "text": "Nenna et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1188, "text": "(Liao et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1252, "text": "(Glencross et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1596, "text": "(February-March-April, 2020", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2231, "text": "Zhang et al.

Beelen et al. (2013) report the need to draw attention to the continuing effects of air pollution on health. A socioeconomic strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to the COVID-19 is also the reduction of pollution with fruitful environmental and health effect by the rationalization of manufacturing industry in a perspective of sustainable development and de-industrializing polluting activities in the geographical development of current capitalism. De-industrialization of polluting industries and sustainable development impose often huge social costs in the short term on people, households, and families but they have long-run benefits for human societies. Studies show that public and environmental health policy interventions are necessary and have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality across Europe (cf., Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2013) . In fact, the improvements in air quality have been accompanied by demonstrable benefits to human health. Pope et al.

(2020) suggest that different air quality strategies should be applied in inland and coastal cities, e.g., coastal cities also need start bio aerosol risk alarm during moderate pollution when severe pollution occurs in inland cities. Guo et al. (2019) argue that haze pollution is a serious environmental problem affecting cities, proposing implications for urban planning to improve public respiratory health. In short, the long-term benefits of sustainable economic development are basic for the improvement of environment, atmosphere, air quality and especially health of populations as well as to reduce possible factors determining accelerated diffusion of viral infectivity (Blackaby, 1978; Bluestone and Harrison, 1982; Pike, 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 245, "text": "(Groulx et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 316, "end": 337, "text": "Carugno et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 338, "end": 357, "text": "Nenna et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 386, "end": 405, "text": "(Liao et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 448, "end": 472, "text": "(Glencross et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 475, "end": 495, "text": "Beelen et al.

This study revels interesting results of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak given by two mechanisms that may have accelerated the diffusion in Italy: air pollution-to-human and human-to-human transmission that create dangerous interaction over time and space. However, these conclusions are tentative. There are several challenges to such studies, particularly in real time. Sources may be incomplete, or only capture certain aspects of the on-going outbreak dynamics; there is need for much more research in to the complex relations between viral infectivity, air pollution, meteorological factors, immune systems and other determinants.
