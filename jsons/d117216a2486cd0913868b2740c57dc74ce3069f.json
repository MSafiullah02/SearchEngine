MRI, CT scan, and clinical examinations including International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI were performed at admission. The information included: demographic data, transport type, date of admission and discharge, past illnesses, addiction habits, cause and type of injury, injury level, associated injuries, injury-related complications, and mortality. Results Mean age was 43 years (median 41, range 17-83). Seventeen patients had a complete and 15 an incomplete SCI, six were unknown. Most frequent causes for tSCI were traffic accidents (42%) and falls (40%), 24% of the accidents were contracted at work. Sixteen patients were ventilator dependent at some point during the acute period. Common complications were pressure ulcers, gastrointestinal-related, and infections. Hospital length of stay (LOS) ranged from 1 to 73 days. The in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. Conclusion The annual incidence of tSCI in FYROM was in 2015-16 13 persons/million inhabitants per year. The epidemiological profile of tSCI in FYROM implies that preventive measures should be taken to reduce incidence of accidents in traffic and at work places. The high mortality rate and complications underline further actions to improve the acute care of tSCI in FYROM.",

            "text": "The incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) vary across the world, assorted literature describes from 9.2 to 246 per million residents a year [1] . Since systematic SCI rehabilitation programs were introduced, mortality rates decreased and life expectancy increased among patients with SCI [2] . However, mortality rates and life expectancy vary in different countries. That is probably due to differences in early and long-term evaluation and treatment, employment, mobility aids, social and financial support, etc. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has a population of \u223c2 million on an area of 25 713 km 2 . The University Clinic for Traumatology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Reanimation, Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Center (TOARILUC), Mother Teresa, Skopje, FYROM, is a level one trauma hospital and the only public hospital treating patients with SCI in the country. In recent years, private hospitals also treating persons with SCI have been established in Skopje, but due to very high expenses, these services are out of reach for most citizens of FYROM. To our knowledge, there are no published studies on epidemiology, early evaluation and treatment of patients with SCI in FYROM. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate incidence, cause of injury, demography and SCI characteristics, acute phase mortality/ survival, and early complications after tSCI among patients admitted to the University Clinic for TOARILUC. The findings may point to issues relevant for the prevention of tSCI in FYROM and also indicate problem areas that need to be improved in the acute care after SCI.",

If vital signs were stable, an extensive examination was done within the first 6 h after the injury, including: the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI), if the patient was conscious and awake [3] , Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Computerized tomography (CT) scan, and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine.

Four seasons were defined as follows: winter (1st December to 28th February), spring (1st March to 31st May), summer (1st June to 31st august), and autumn (1st September to 30th November). We defined a complication as a secondary condition that occurred during the hospital stay because of the current trauma. We defined \"polytrauma\" as injury to at least two different organ systems of which at least one is life-threatening. A life-threatening injury [11] was defined as an injury that could cause death without emergency assistance. Associated injuries were defined as injuries that occurred at the same time as the SCI, and due to the current trauma. Associated injuries included moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, nonvertebral fractures requiring surgery among more, according to International SCI Core Data Set [4] . Surgical wound infection was suspected when an area (at the incision site) showed signs of rubor, oedema, pain and increased temperature with or without secretion, or a wound not healing as expected. Signs suggestive of an urinary tract infection was malodorous and cloudy urine, muscular spasticity, fatigue, fevers, chills, and autonomic instability. Sepsis was suspected by the presence of two or more of the following: abnormal body temperature, increased heart rate above 100 beats per minute, increased breathing rate above 20 respirations per minute or arterial blood gas analyses and white blood count, confirmed with positive blood culture [12] . Obstipation was defined as reduced frequency or ease of stool passage from what is deemed the normal expected pattern for that individual. Acute diarrhea was defined as the abrupt onset of three or more loose stools per day lasting no longer than 14 days, chronic diarrhea was defined as a period lasting longer than 14 days. Melena was suspected by the passage of dark tarry stools containing decomposing blood, the cause of melena was confirmed by gastroscopy.",

The high incidence of brain injuries (29%) and polytrauma among our participants could be an indication of a greater forces involved in the accidents, one could speculate that this underlines our suspicion of higher mortality at the time of injury.

The most frequent cause of injury in our study was traffic accidents, which is in line with findings in Greece [14] . Roads and the motor vehicle fleet in FYROM are old and often in bad condition. Preventive measures as enforcement of speed limits, use of safety belts, and regular control of the cars standard must be taken to reduce SCI related to road-and traffic-conditions. In contrast, falls is the leading cause to SCI in many other European countries [16] [17] [18] . In order to be able to develop prevention strategies, it is important to realize the mechanisms of the falls [19] . In our sample, work accidents happened to individuals between 46 and 60 years of age and most frequently among workers at construction sites, and within agriculture. Therefore the use of safety lines and railings at the construction sites need to be enforced like other safety gear such as helmets, shoes, etc. Falls at the same level was the leading cause of SCI for the age group above 60, a trend similarly observed in developed countries with the aging population [20] .",

In the Thessaloniki study [14, 24] , life threatening injuries was observed in 23% of the patients, while in our study 50% of the patients had life threatening injuries. Pressure ulcers were one of the most prevalent complications in our patients, which is in accordance with other studies [25, 26] . However, our data of 21% of patients with pressure ulcers is low compared with other reports [25, 26] . We assume this is because our hospital has a long experience with critical ill patients and precautions were taken together with the use of antidecubital mattresses, to avoid pressure ulcers. We observed no association between NLI and pressure ulcers, which likewise was experienced by others [27] . Infections were common, as reported in other studies [28] [29] [30] . We observed that participants with more than 2 ICU days and between 10 and 20 ventilator days more frequently developed ventilator associated pneumonia, which also has been observed previously [31] . We have not observed other complications which are otherwise commonly reported, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [32] [33] [34] , the patients were under constant monitoring for changes in hemostasis and the hospital use compression stockings and Clexane (40 mg \u00d71 s.c, continued up to 6 weeks). Furthermore, we did not observe instances of autonomic dysreflexia, a possible cause could be a high mortality rate among cervical complete SCI patients and short LOS.

Our mortality rate during the observation period of 2.5 months after injury exceeds even that of the first year mortality rate in neighboring countries. First year mortality rate after tSCI ranges from 0.6% in Turkey to 20% in Finland [1, 35] . In Thessaloniki the first year mortality rate was reported to be 20% [36] , however they have excluded patients that died the first week of the injury. In our study, 75% of those who died in hospital were on ventilator support. Previous studies have shown that persons with SCI in the need of mechanical ventilator support have a reduced survival rate [34] . We reported 90% mortality rate among elderly (above 60 years of age) in line with other reports [35] . We had one patient with Bechterew's disease who died after 1 week at the ICU, and as shown previously [37] these patients are at higher risk of early death after SCI than those without this spinal condition. All in all the injuries reported in this study seem to be more severe than reported from other countries and hospitals, furthermore a combination of severe injuries (polytrauma, including severe head trauma) and complications, most likely contribute to the high inhospital mortality. The hospital personnel is highly educated and experienced in treating polytraumatised, still prevention is possible only if the reason for death is known. Autopsies are not routinely performed because of cultural believes in our country, although according to the law every death in a hospital should be further examined with an autopsy.",

The first author contacted colleagues, orthopedic surgeons, at Orthopedic hospital St.Erasmo-Ohrid (they treat scoliosis and vertebral fractures/dislocations without SCI), and the other hospital that has orthopedic ward in Skopje, named 8th of September, and they both confirmed that they do not treat SCI patients. This information is not official and is not in a written form. There was an agreement many years ago that the Spine Unit at TOARILUC will be the only hospital to treat tSCI in North Macedonia. The National Statistical Office was contacted as well, but they do not hold information related to the organization of the acute care of tSCI. In addition, there is an agreement that all polytraumatized patients to be admitted to TOARILUC. The authors cannot know if everyone adhere to this agreement. In recent years, private hospitals have been established in Skopje that are able to treat patients with SCI, but the cost is very high, thus excluding most citizens. To the best of our knowledge, private hospitals received acute patients with tSCI from Kosovo mainly, in addition to the five patients transferred from our hospital. A further advantage for the study is that all but one of the ISNCSCI assessments, all the clinical examinations and interviews were carried out by one person only (the first author) an experienced clinician with proper training in ISNCSCI, thus all the data are collected and analyzed alike.",

Due to high mortality and in-hospital complications, even though common complications like autonomic dysreflexia were not observed, we believe this study can raise awareness of their existence and help improve care of future patients. In addition, passive and lung physiotherapy is not established to the point of accomplishing success for all patients at ICU because of lack of staff. Therefore this is another important message from this study and could be an area for future intervention and research. Furthermore, there is no centralized rehabilitation center for SCI persons after they leave the acute clinic. To be educated about their new living condition and precaution measures for the skin, urinary tract etc., is a very important part of the comprehensive SCI treatment. Our findings indicate that preventive strategies should focus on traffic-, fall related-, and diving accidents, including the work related accidents. There is a relatively low yearly incidence of 13 SCI/million inhabitants, probably due to underreported deaths due to SCI at the scene of accident or at other local hospitals. We found a high in-hospital mortality rate of 32%, most likely due to the high degree of polytrauma among our patients. We observed that patients with extended stay in ICU developed more complications. Finally, the study points to the need for organized rehabilitation for SCI patients after discharge from the acute hospital.",
