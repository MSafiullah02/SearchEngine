            "text": "Globalization may be defined as the transition from national and regional economies to global economies, and includes a nexus of economic and social process whereby local markets and cultures are increasingly dominated by global markets and culture [1, 2]. It is a result of the growing interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of cross\u2010border transactions in goods and services, and also through the more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology. Although globalization is not just an economic phenomenon, it is frequently described as such, ignoring the homogenization of language and cultural identity that accompanies this flux of material, ideas and money. The most controversial aspects of globalization, manifested in the sometimes violent demonstrations accompanying events designed to further it, centre around this aspect. With the free, if unequal, flow of raw materials, manufactured goods, intellectual property and financial transactions, supervision solely through an international trade authority overlooks the effects on identity, environment and culture.",

It is clear that the bulk of the profits of the pharmaceutical sector occur as a result of the consumption of these products in the developed world [3]. High\u2010mortality developing countries, representing 41\u00b74% of the world's population, carry 82% of the world's communicable disease burden [4]. At the same time, tropical diseases and tuberculosis, accounting for 11\u00b74% of the global disease burden, attracted only 1% of the new chemical entities marketed between 1975 and 1999 [5]. Furthermore, the capacity to develop therapeutics to counter these diseases is lacking in the very areas which are affected by them, with more than 90% of the worldwide pharmaceutical production by value, and 97% of research and development activities, occurring in developed countries in 1998 [6]. Furthermore, three\u2010quarters of new therapeutic drugs approved by the FDA between 1989 and 2000 were \u2018me\u2010too\u2019 medicines with no significant benefit over existing treatments [7], suggesting that pharmaceutical research has minimal orientation to diseases affecting the developing world. The needs of the developing world appear to be unaffected by globalization, at least to any favourable level.",

Data gathered by the World Health Organization show that the donation rate [8] and extent of viral marker testing (Table 1) are dependant on economic status [9]. In an ideal and globalized environment, one would expect that the challenges facing the world's safety and supply of blood would be addressed through the free movement of blood\u2010derived therapeutics across borders, by the free and rapid implementation of measures to counter safety threats and by investment into the major problems underlying safety and supply. Is this happening? The developed world's capacity to deal with established and emerging blood safety threats, many of which are the result of globalization, is impressive and issues such as West Nile virus (WNV) and variant Creutzfeldt\u2010Jakob disease (vCJD) will be discussed below. A similar capacity is clearly lacking in the developing world where a different set challenges exist. Malaria is probably the most common transfusion\u2010transmitted infection worldwide [10], and may be introduced into developed blood systems via travellers in endemic areas; in this instance current deferral measures in these systems is considered to provide adequate protection. Its high prevalence in endemic areas makes deferral measures unrealistic, and a screening strategy based on a specific test is urgently needed. It is relevant that such a testing infrastructure is only just starting to emerge, with the Australian blood service introducing a strategy aimed at minimizing the donor losses incurred through travel\u2010associated deferral [11]. It would be beneficial if this strategy could be \u2018globalized\u2019 into environments where it is desperately needed; the extent to which this may happen will depend on how much it can be supported by governments in these areas, and how issues such as patents (see below) can affect its delivery to the developing world. One can anticipate that other, currently restricted, infections such as Chaga's Disease will recruit the interest of developed blood systems and diagnostic manufacturers, with similar issues as to their introduction to the areas where they are most needed.",

The publicly stated reason for self\u2010sufficiency is frequently ascribed to the World Health Assembly's Resolution 28\u00b772 of 1975, which urged member states to develop national blood systems to avoid the exploitation of blood donors in the developing world. This laudable principle was universally subscribed by the Assembly; its extension to the exclusion of blood and blood products from cross\u2010border passage has been a regrettable incursion of nationalistic interests into blood management, frequently at the expense of patients. The use of surplus red cells from the Swiss Red Cross by thalassaemiacs in Greece and Cyprus in the 1960s and 1970s,\n1\n and more recently the \u2018Euroblood\u2019 programme which supplied 33% and 2% of the New York and US blood supply, respectively [12], are examples where blood has, successfully and beneficially, crossed borders.

Where this is done with suitable controls for safety, benefits in the supply of products can accrue to communities which have, traditionally, lacked access to high quality plasma derivatives.

When it has been a thinly disguised manifestation of economic nationalism verging on racism through unscientific allegations of selective association of increased infectious risk in certain ethnic groups, it is to be deplored. A stark example is the Israeli ban on Ethiopian blood donors because of an (alleged) enhanced risk of HIV transmission, a decision which resulted in mass protests leading to serious injuries. Subsequent assessment [14] concluded that \u2018the banning of Ethiopian donors reduced the annual number of HIV\u20101 infected donations from 0\u00b734 to 0\u00b724, an absolute reduction of only 0\u00b71 infectious donations per year\u2019, and suggested that \u2018viewed simply from this perspective, was banning Ethiopian donors justified? The costs of treating those injured in protests might exceed the cost resulting from an additional infectious donation every 10 years.\u2019 In summary, if the mass movements in human population which have been a feature of globalization over the past 20 years are not reflected in an appropriate and scientifically based policy for the integration of these people in the blood supply, then detrimental effects on this supply will ensue, as happened in Israel [15].",

This is a salient feature of market pressures and the globalized nature of the sector is very evident through the multiple plants now owned by the major fractionators, with the capacity to collect plasma in one country, generate intermediate fractions in another and deliver final product in a third. While the flexibility generated through these developments makes product delivery more efficient, the need for a strong regulatory system to oversee this cross\u2010border traffic of plasma and products was illustrated by the Albovina scandal in the late 1990s [18]. The shrinking number of players has the potential to decrease choice while the gradual elimination of nonprofitable products from the portfolio of many fractionators is of concern, particularly to sufferers from rare disorders [19].",

Concurrently some countries have wound down their national fractionation capacity to access the capacity of large agencies such as Sanquin in the Netherlands, or have elected to sell plasma to the commercial sector and purchase product independently, e.g. the Czech Republic. In the commercial sector, similar competitive pressures have seen the USA\u2013Australia Free Trade Agreement include a commitment by the Australian government into conducting a review of its plasma fractionation arrangements [21] which have traditionally been the monopoly of a single national fractionation agency.\n3\n It is intriguing that this process has already caused a change in Australia's national self\u2010sufficiency policy, with a move away from previous criteria demanding clinical superiority in imported products before their acceptance by the national regulator [22]. Irrespective of the rationale of such national\u2010centric policies, and this author's reservations are noted above, the pressure to alter national policies in response to market\u2010driven pressures articulated through political powers must be viewed with concern. In this instance, it is linked to the US government's introduction of national price negotiation mechanisms, such as Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme [23], into free trade negotiations.",

These will result in 20\u2010year patents on pharmaceutical products also in countries that previously did not grant product patents, e.g. India. There will be no differentiation between lifesaving medicines and trivial goods. In November 2001, WTO members adopted the Doha Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health, which said the TRIPs Agreement \u2018can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members\u2019 right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all\u2019[25]. This welcome declaration contrasts with some aspects of patent protection which have affected public health, including blood safety. As an example, the high royalty payment associated with HCV testing increases significantly the cost of the test for screening blood [26], and it is significant that HCV screening is the lowest in low HDI countries (Table 1). These patent\u2010driven increased prices are claimed to b necessary to ensure recouping of R & D costs and reinvestment into R & D for new and innovative products. The sombre reality is that little pharmaceutical investment is being put into innovative treatments, with the bulk going into existing treatments [7] as \u2018me\u2010too\u2019 products. There is a tendency for this in blood safety measures in developed systems, exemplified by the increased investment in further refining NAT for the \u2018known and loved\u2019 viruses through single donation testing platforms which do little to enhance safety with microscopic cost\u2010effectiveness [27], while, as discussed above, pathogens of relevance in the developing world remain untested. There is scant evidence that patent protection, touted as essential to ensure continued development and globalization of health benefits, is enhancing blood safety. The patenting of technologies such as solvent\u2010detergent and heat\u2010treatment of plasma derivatives contributed to the delay in the widespread introduction of inactivation of the pathogenic transfusion transmitted enveloped viruses. The growing obsession with intellectual property shown by publicly funded utilities sits uneasily with their declarations of moral superiority over the \u2018commercial\u2019 sector and demands for protection from competition, a posture which frequently characterizes the \u2018self\u2010sufficiency\u2019 proponents.",

As mankind impacts more and more on the natural environment, mostly under the pressures introduced by globalization, risks emerge in fairly unpredictable fashions. As discussed by Murphy [32], assuming that an understanding of the causes of past problems in blood safety and supply will lead to an ability to address future problems, through a linear approach to predict threats, is open to criticism. The effect of globalization pressures on these events is, however, undeniable. As a case study, the events surrounding the introduction of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to cattle, the infection's subsequent spread beyond its origin and its ultimate passage into humans as vCJD, with the current demonstration of its transmissibility through blood, bear reflection (Fig. 2). The presumed aetiology proposes that pathologic prion was introduced and amplified into the cattle food chain through modified rendering processes which had insufficient capacity to inactivate it.\n5\n The need to maximize UK beef production as a result of the competitive global trade for beef presumably influenced this decision [27]. This demonstrates the danger of streamlining manufacturing processes when the outcome may be a biological product capable of transmitting disease. The passage of this infection into humans as vCJD was rapidly appreciated as a potential blood safety risk, as animal models had demonstrated infectivity in blood and the increased lymphoreticular involvement in vCJD compared to classical CJD suggested that the epidemiological indications that the latter was not transmitted through blood could not be extended to vCJD. These apprehensions were borne out by the small number of vCJD cases transmitted through blood. The UK government's decision to stop using British plasma for the production of plasma derivatives represented a commendable attempt to avoid further spread of the infection through these products; subsequent restrictions by authorities worldwide on blood donors resident in the UK are thus understandable. The effect of these policies on overall blood safety and supply has been pointed out by O\u2019Neill [26], who has commented on the shift in deferral policies from the exclusion of the indigent and the ill to that of the healthy and the wealthy, which are the class of the population which travel and are educated, two characteristics of blood donors in developed countries.",

For example, the American Red Cross\u2019 decision to continue collecting blood in the aftermath of the 9/11 incident despite the clear indication that much of it was not needed, to be followed by the inevitable discarding of expired units [35], drew substantial criticism. Unplanned expansions in the blood supply also have the potential to affect safety through affecting the balance between new and regular donors in the blood supply [36].
