In this paper, we evaluate the impact on the Internet latency caused by the increased amount of human activities that are carried out on-line. The study focuses on Italy, which experienced significant restrictions imposed by local authorities, but results about Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole Europe are also included. The analysis of a large set of measurements shows that the impact on the network is significant, especially in terms of increased variability of latency. In Italy we observed that the standard deviation of the additional delay -the additional time with respect to the minimum for a given path -during lockdown is \u223c 3 \u2212 6 times as much as the value before the pandemic. Similarly, packet loss is \u223c 1.4 \u2212 7 times as much as before the pandemic. The impact is not negligible also for the other countries and for the whole Europe, but with different levels and distinct patterns.",

Distance learning and remote working were applied whenever possible, with a significant increase in usage of virtual meeting and video-conference applications [6] , [7] . Table I summarizes the most important events which could have had an impact on the Italian Internet latency. As can be noticed, limitations to citizens have been introduced progressively. For this reason, the changes caused by the Italian lockdown are studied, in the remaining of this paper, by comparing the situation of the network in the February 11-17 week with the March 10-16 week. The former represent the \"normal\" situation of the network, as it is antecedent to all restrictive measures; the latter, on the contrary, comes just after the most restrictive limitations. The period in between corresponds to a transitory phase, where partial lockdowns start to impact the network performance. Hereafter, we will use W1 to indicate the baseline week, and W2 for the week just after the major lockdown event.",

However, a picture that leaves aside the very specific points of view of the single operators is still missing. This study provides a more global view, not polarized by the single operator's perspective. In addition, most of the statistics released by operators concern the amount of traffic, with limited (or absence of) information about latency. \u2022 The amount of measurements analyzed is large, thus providing solid foundations for the included statistics. Moreover, besides the sheer number, we decompose the impact on delay according to the most relevant factors, including the time of the day, the type of target (belonging to a content delivery network or not), and the version of the Internet Protocol. \u2022 Besides Italy, results also concerning Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole Europe are included.

In particular, a large set of devices called probes perform measurements towards other devices called anchors, every 15 minutes. Anchors are usually hosted in Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), in the operation centers of ISPs, or in data centers. Hence, they enable monitoring of the core infrastructure of the Internet. The results produced by AMs have been extensively used for both research (see, for instance, [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] ) and operational purposes (for example DNSMON [15] , a service aimed at monitoring the worldwide core DNS infrastructure). Additionally, RIPE Atlas allows its users to collect measurements towards arbitrary targets. Results of User-Defined Measurements (UDMs) are stored in a database from where they are accessible to the public (their access is not restricted to the experimenters who triggered them). RIPE Atlas, for its measurements, relies on classical network tools. The latency from an Atlas node to a target is estimated by means of the ping tool which, as known, makes use of ICMP echo requests and echo replies. For AMs, ping is launched to collect three Round Trip Time (RTT) values. For the UDMs, the default number of collected RTT values is again three, but this number can also be changed by the experimenter.",

To obtain such subset, we adopted the following strategies. First, we extracted only periodic latency measurements, i.e. configured to be automatically repeated after a certain amount of time. Second, we discarded the measurements configured to collect less than three latency values per ping execution. Third, we further filtered the selection to contain only the measurements concerning source-target pairs that produced successful results in at least ten different days. This was done to eliminate measurements occurring in a concentrated time period. Fourth, we restricted measurements to the ones targeting IP addresses in Europe. It is important to notice that in UDMs only the location of the source nodes is well-known, as it is provided by RIPE Atlas. Hence, for this step, we estimated the position of the targets by using RIPE IPmap [16] . RIPE IPmap uses active geolocation, and it has been reported to be 100% accurate at continent level and 99.58% at country level [17] . Additionally we used MaxMind GeoLite2 [18] as a fallback tool, in case of failed IP geolocation with RIPE IPmap. Measurements where the target was not successfully geolocated using these two tools were discarded. Finally, in some cases, we had to limit the amount of extracted information due to the almost unmanageable volume of data in the repository. In particular, when the number of targets in the geographic area of interest was too large, we randomly selected 10 000 targets and the analysis was restricted to them. Even when we had to limit Germany is put on lockdown the number of targets, the number of sources from which measurements were started was not subject to any limitation. From now on we will refer to the dataset built according to the above-described procedure as the UDM-derived dataset (UDMD). UDMD is composed of 596 million RTT values generated by 561 755 source-target pairs during the observation time period.",

To isolate d q from the other components, we estimated d t + d p for each couple of endpoints as the minimum delay observed in all measurements for that couple. The observation period has a duration of approximately six weeks, with measurements collected at different times of the day including nighttime, when the network is presumably lightly loaded.

Figure 1a shows the evolution of r min , r avg , and r max (without distinction between IPv6 and IPv4) for the whole observation period. It can be noticed that all values progressively increase over time. Since Italy experienced some partial lockdown events before the most restrictive one, there is no step-like increase, rather a continuous one. However, approximately from February 23, when schools were closed in Northern Italy, delays start to grow and higher peaks can be observed. The largest increase can be observed on March 10, which is the date of the complete Italian lockdown. Similar patterns, but more accentuated, can be seen for UDMD, shown in Figure 1b . In this case, the increase of RTTs can be seen clearly starting from February 22, when Besides the generally increasing value of all the three curves corresponding to the three r variations, the higher variability of latency is also evident. This can be observed in two ways: i) the distance between the blue curve and the red curve, which represents the difference between the minimum and maximum RTT value in a ping execution, tends to become larger; ii) the fluctuations of each single curve are much more evident. The increased variation is also visible in Figure 2 , which compares the value of r min in W1 and W2. The average r min in W2 is 30.2% higher with respect to W1. Variability of r min is characterized by a much larger increase, with a standard deviation that is approximately 2.8 times as much as the one in W1. We also estimated the impact of lockdown in terms of packet loss, as the fraction of unsuccessful echo request/reply. Also for this metric, the increase is significant: from 1.1e-3 to 1.5e-3 (+41.5%) for AMD, and from 1.6e-3 to 1.1e-2 (+562.9%) for UDMD.",

It is clearly visible how the increase is not uniform across the time of the day. Night hours show no considerable increase. This is not surprising, as human activity is very limited at night, thus also the congestion of the Internet. Morning hours show some little increase. Afternoon hours show a more evident increase, but the highest increase occurs between 16:00 UTC and 22:00 UTC, with a peak between 20:00 and 21:00 UTC. This is interesting, as it suggests that remote working and distance learning have some impact on the Italian Internet latency.

This phenomenon could be explained by the infrastructural enhancements introduced by network operators to respond to the crisis.

In both cases the ratio goes slightly below one during night and morning hours. Especially surprising is Figure 4c where the the ratio goes below one for the entire morning. This could happen as in Figure 4c we consider sources outside Italy, thus the access network is still not involved in a lockdown phase, and targets in the Italian infrastructure, which as mentioned has been improved to cope with the traffic increase. During night and morning hours the load on the network is still light, so in this particular configuration the performance could increase. To conclude, in evening hours the increased Internet usage during lockdown generally produces larger delays, but in periods of lighter load the network is sometimes more efficient than before the lockdown.",

We considered Spain, France, and Germany, which had their major lockdown events respectively five, seven, and twelve days after Italy. In addition, we considered Sweden, as an example of a country that adopted a no-lockdown policy. Finally, we considered all European countries together. Overall results are depicted in Figure 8 . Table II reports the increment of the average and standard deviation of r min after stay-at-home orders. To obtain the increment, for each country we compared the first week of measurements (W1) and the first week of lockdown (W2). For Germany, the considered periods are fourday long instead of seven: Germany was put on lockdown at the end of our observation period and a full week was not covered by the collected data. Since there is not a unique date for lockdown in the whole Europe, and since some countries did not even enter a lockdown phase, for Sweden and Europe we compared the first and the last week of the observation period. The two weeks used for comparison are highlighted in light grey in Figure 8 . In the following we analyze the considered countries in detail. Spain shows high variability of latencies also before the lockdown. However, an increase due to enforced restrictions is noticeable in AMD. Similarly, circadian patterns become more evident (Figure 8a ). This is confirmed also by the summary statistics, which shows an increment of 41.4% of the r min average, and of 21.1% of the r min standard deviation, in W2 compared to W1. The visual analysis of UDMD shows a progressive increase of latency which starts much earlier than the lockdown, and a transient instability around March 17 ( Figure 8b ). However, results in Table II show an increment similar to the one observed in AMD: 51.4% for the average and 21.0% for the standard deviation. On March 7, a temporary increase can be observed in Figure 8b . We investigated this phenomenon and found that it is due to a considerable increase in the latency towards one target, observed from multiple sources. We believe this to be an anomalous behavior due to the target itself or the network in its proximity.",

First of all, it is worth to notice that Germany shows the lowest variability in measurements, which could indicate that the Internet infrastructure is generally more stable. In AMD, the effect of lockdown is noticeable only in terms of amplified circadian patterns (Figure 8e ). The analysis confirms this, by showing just a 5.6% increase of the r min average, and a 37.0% increase of the r min standard deviation. In UDMD, a more significant increase of latency is visible (Figure 8f) , which corresponds to a 20.5% higher value for the r min average in W2 compared to W1. It is worth to notice that in Germany the degradation of the latencies starts more than one week before the lockdown.

Both AMD and UDMD show a progressive increase of r and its variability in the considered time period. This can mean either that Swedish people autonomously increased social distancing and implemented stay-at-home policies, or that the performance of the Swedish Internet infrastructure has been affected by the effects of the lockdowns imposed in other countries. Also the comparison of W1 and W2 show a significant increase of r min average and standard deviation: 77.3% and 293.4% for AMD and 45.7% and 160.6% for UDMD. Figure 8i and Figure 8j show respectively the AMD-and UDMD-based results for all Europe. Additional latency is generally smaller than the individual countries we analyzed. The response to national lockdowns seems to be fairly good even if it can be noticed an accentuation of the variability due to the circadian activities, starting from the Italian lockdown, but not a significant increase of the overall latencies. This is confirmed by the statistics reported in Table II : the r min average is subject to a modest increase, equal to 13.6% and 9.1% in AMD and UDMD respectively, while the r min standard deviation experiences a significant increase, equal to 183.2% and 50.8%.

Latency is particularly important not only because it has a profound effect on some classes of applications, but also because it is, by itself, an excellent indicator of the health status of the network. Results, which have been obtained from the analysis of a large amount of measurements (the European AMD-based results rely on more than 6 billion latency values), show that the impact of the increased on-line activities is relevant, especially in terms of higher jitter. The major changes have been observed in the evening, the time of the day when most of the on-line activities are related to entertainment. This suggests that distance learning and remote working contributed to a lesser extent in terms of additional network latency. Results obtained for the considered countries show relevant differences, which can be due to the resilience levels of their network and/or to the non-uniform restrictions imposed by authorities.",
