Obviously, in all cases the SM values belong to the 95% CL area; still, it might be noticed that the SM value is not the most probable value in the 95% CL region: there is an area with strongly correlated values of the anomalous couplings different from their SM values, which has a higher probability. Such interesting correlated solutions cannot be seen within 1D or 2D scenarios; a full correlated 3D analysis is necessary to observe them. Finally, Fig. (3) gives a one-dimensional distribution of the individual coupling, obtained by integrating the 3D distribution over other couplings. We emphasize that these 1D distributions have a complicated shape and are much broader than the 1D distributions obtained by setting all other couplings to their SM values. ",

Our conclusions may be summarized as follows: 1. Taking into account that any analysis of the B-physics data involves the theoretical calculation of complicated nonperturbative QCD effects (e.g., related to B-meson in the initial state, light mesons in the final state, charmingloops and charmonia resonances) only those modes where such effects may be controlled with good accuracy provide the possibility to probe the anomalous W tb couplings. Presently, such effects are limited to FCNC ra- where the gluon penguin operator O 8 or four-quark operators provide sizeable contributions, the nonperturbative QCD effects are very difficult to calculate with good accuracy; therefore such processes are not suitable for the analysis of the anomalous couplings from the data. Consequently, B-decays can provide bounds on three quantities: the anomalous couplings f V L , f T R and one linear combination f of two other couplings, f V R and f T L , that appears in the Wilson coefficient \u03b4C 7 .",
