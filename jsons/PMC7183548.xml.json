In times of disease outbreaks, we are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of deaths: we pay attention to the total count only and forget that there is an individual patient\u2019s story behind each number that is added. However, I believe that every single case is unique and important in its own right. Here, I will try to underscore this point by providing a narrative for the life and death of a chimpanzee I got to know in the wild (Fig. 1).",

According to the WHO, the total number of confirmed and probable cases in the three countries reached 17,843, and 11,308 deaths were registered by March 2016. Since African great apes are vulnerable to Ebola as well (Leendertz et al. 2017), we put all fieldwork with wild chimpanzees in Bossou and Nimba on hold for 1.5 years, from April 2014 to November 2015. We also asked the local people not to enter to the forest and asked the Guinean authorities to stop ecotourism to prevent possible transmission from humans to chimpanzees.

The index case may have been infected when playing in a hollow tree housing a colony of insectivorous free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus). Bats in this family have previously been discussed as potential sources for Ebola virus outbreaks (Sa\u00e9z 2015).

My colleagues and I have been running field experiments on stone tool use by wild chimpanzees at a designated site, Bossou\u2019s \u201coutdoor laboratory\u201d, since 1988 (Matsuzawa 1994; Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa 1997; Biro et al. 2003; Schofield et al. 2019). In this natural clearing in the forest, located on top of a sacred hill, experimental objects (nuts and stones) are provided by experimenters, and chimpanzees crack nuts using stone hammers and anvils. We keep a distance of about 15 m from the chimpanzees, hiding ourselves behind a grass fence to record their behavior. Bossou chimpanzees often visit the outdoor laboratory spontaneously, as one of many oil-palm nut-cracking sites available in the area.",

So Ja bends a shrub, trying to encourage Jokro to play in this way, but still, Jokro does not move. After cracking nuts, the chimpanzees move on to feed on fruits high up in the trees. As they are moving from one tree to the next, I happen to observe that Jokro\u2019s big sister, Ja, is transporting a log. She carries the log on her shoulder, or holds it under her arm. When she stops on a branch, she gently pats the log. To me, this is somehow reminiscent of the toys of young girls native to the area around Bossou, whose dolls consist of a simple straight log with hair attached to the top.

A six-and-a-half-year-old male, named Na, takes Jokro\u2019s body and climbs a tree with it. He swings the corpse and lets it fall to the ground from a height of about 5 m. He rushes down the tree and picks it up, then climbs up and drops it again. He repeats this over and over. It looks like two young chimpanzees playing chase. Meanwhile, Jire looks on gently.",

However, I notice a subtle detail. When Tua turns around, he gently switches the body from his right to left hand. With branches, he has never shown such delicate handling as with Jokro\u2019s remains. I sensed an unknown side to him, and others of his kind\u2014a part hiding deep within the chimpanzee\u2019s mind. Tua abandons the body right in front of me, only about 5 m away. Jokro has become a perfect mummy. All her body parts have remained intact\u2014only a jaw is missing. The mother, Jire, retrieves Jokro\u2019s body, just as she always has (Fig. 7).",

Over the course of 45 years of study, from 1976 to 2020, we have recorded 58 chimpanzees at the site, and 11 confirmed cases and 6 probable cases of death among the Bossou community. I first encountered the death of a wild chimpanzee on January 17th 1988, during my second trip to Bossou. Guided by a bad smell, my colleague and I happened to come across the corpse of Npei, a 6.5-year-old male. We carefully measured his skull and bones and compared them with those from other field sites and captivity. In doing so, we learned about the physical development of wild chimpanzees from Npei\u2019s death (Matsuzawa et al. 1990). Many years later, I was faced with the death of a 58-year-old female named Velu. Based on my long-term observation of Velu and her offspring, I put together an account of her life story (Matsuzawa 2018). As in the case of these two chimpanzees, the story of Jokro that I summarized above allows me to keep a record of a life that I witnessed through my fieldwork.",
