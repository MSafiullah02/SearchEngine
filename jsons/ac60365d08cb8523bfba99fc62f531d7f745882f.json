No direct exposure to poultry was noticed, and nobody else in the family was sick. Fever and headache developed in this patient just after her return. She was admitted to Shanghai Orient Hospital on March 25. On admission, she had oral temperature of 38.7\u00b0C. The chest was clear to auscultation, and the blood test was normal. The patient presented no amelioration in spite of intravenous administration of vidarabine and cefotiam with standard dose, so she came to our emergency on March 27. Computed tomography scan showed consolidation in the right upper lobe (Fig. 1A ) while total white cell count (5.35 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and neutrophiles (3.65 \u00d7 10 9 /L) remained normal, but serum creatine kinase increased (CK 582 IU/L). Intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg once a day was added to the regimen. However, the gas analysis realized on March 29 on room air presented a severe hypoxia (PaO 2 : 6.05kPa), and her pulse oxygen saturation fluctuated between 78% and 82% despite the use of biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP). So the patient was transferred to specialist intensive care unit (ICU) on March 31, where the intubation was done. Specimens obtained from nose and throat swabs by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on day 2 of hospitalization were confirmed to be positive for H7N9 by means of rt-PCR. The patient stayed 14 days in the ICU; pulmonary infiltrations rapidly extended to both lungs (Fig. 1B) , and clinically she continued worsening despite the antiviral and antibiotic treatment (oseltamivir 150 mg twice a day through nasogastric tube + imipenem 500 mg q6h iv + linezolid 600 mg q12h iv).

The arterial gas analysis showed a severe hypoxia (PaO 2 5.47 kPa, SaO 2 61%) on room air, requiring noninvasive ventilation with BiPAP. We noticed the elevation of C-reactive protein (73 mg/L) and CK (537 IU/L) at the same time.

The first X-ray ( Fig. 3A ) was taken in emergency and showed consolidation in right middle lobe; 1 day later, the lesions extended rapidly to right lower lobe and left middle lobe (Fig. 3B ). Like the first two cases, the hemogram was normal whereas CK increased to 2758 IU/L and PaO 2 decreased to 5.13 kPa. The patient was intubated on April 10, and he was laboratory confirmed to be the third case of A H7N9 virus infection on the same day. Two weeks later, he was successfully extubated and now sequentially supported by BiPAP Vision (Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA) with stable vital signs. The rt-PCR result of his throat swabs turned negative of H7N9 after 21 days' use of oseltamivir (150 mg twice a day through nasogastric tube from April 10 to April 30). Repeated sputum cultures of the patient were positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia since April 27, but the blood cultures remained sterile. The patient became apyrexic on May 4 with antibiotherapy of cefepime (2 g q12h iv).

All of the patients were overweight to obese, with BMI ranging from 26 to 35 (mean 31). None of the patients had upper respiratory tract symptoms or conjunctivitis. Fever and later onset dyspnea were the major symptoms. The hemograms were normal at presentation, and we observed a substantial elevation of CK in all three patients. Upper and middle lobe of the right lung are the most affected zones at early stage of the disease, which may be related to the inhalation of the virus by respiratory tract, and then rapidly extended to both lungs within 7-15 days (mean 10 days). Antiviral therapy with traditional medications like vidarabine and ribavirin showed no effect on this kind of infection. Three patients were given 150 mg oral oseltamivir twice daily after throat swab samples were taken, starting a mean of 9.7 days after onset of symptoms. Mean time between onset of symptoms and respiratory failure was 8.6 days. All patients required mechanical ventilation.

Novel influenza viruses of the A H7N9 subtype, characterized by high fever and severe respiratory symptoms, have infected 127 and killed 24 people in China as of April 30, 2013 and may pose a serious human health risk. An understanding of the source and mode of transmission of these infections, further surveillance and appropriate countermeasures are urgently required. This novel influenza viruses' hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase genes probably originated from Eurasian avian influenza viruses; the remaining genes are closely related to avian H9N2 influenza viruses. Several characteristic amino acid changes in HA and the polymerase basic 2 protein (PB2) RNA polymerase subunit probably facilitate binding to human-type receptors and efficient replication in mammals, respectively, highlighting the pandemic potential of the novel viruses (4) (Fig. 4) . However, unlike other types of avian influenza affecting human beings, no increase in poultry deaths was noticed before onset of human infections. Zoonotic infections of A H7N9 virus from birds to humans appear to be associated with live poultry markets, like the last two of our cases. There also have been sporadic reports of human-to-human transmission (5, 6); therefore, the pandemic potential of these novel avianorigin viruses should not be underestimated. We diagnosed avian influenza H7N9 in all three patients (who were epidemiologically unlinked); two patients had histories of wet market exposure to poultry, suggesting poultry-to-person transmission. Fortunately, no close contacts of these three patients are found be infected till now. Our patients presented high fevers, lower respiratory tract symptoms (especially dyspnea) and radiological features of consolidation without upper respiratory tract symptoms. The most striking common preexisting factor of our patient group was obesity or being overweight, which was previously reported to be a risk factor for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in H1N1 infection (7, 8) . In another study, development of ARDS was seen more frequently in obese patients (9) . However, in a large cases study (10), they did not find that obesity was associated with increased mortality. It is may be because our patients are more severe and presented ARDS. The first two patients who died within 1 month were both over 60 and associated with underlying health problems (hypertension and diabetes). The third patient, the 54-year-old male with no medical history, has once been successfully extubated. Thus, we think that poor prognosis may probably be related with old age (>60 years), obesity and presence of comorbidity. All three patients received treatment with oseltamivir starting on day 7-14 of symptoms onsets, probably at the time of respiratory failure onset. Data related to human infections with seasonal, pandemic and HPAI H5N1 viruses indicate that the earlier antiviral treatment is initiated, the greater the clinical benefit (11) . However, none of these clinical, radiological or laboratory changes was pathognomonic, which result in the delay of the antiviral treatment. So this reminds us to pay attention to 'risky' patients with copresence with of fever and dyspnea with normal white blood cell count and CK elevation, especially in those old and overweight patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2098, "end": 2101, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2104, "text": "8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2191, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3059, "end": 3063, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 938, "end": 946, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Virus is not the only germ we face; secondary invasive bacterial infections were found in two of our patients, and one result in fatal sepsis. The development of secondary infection, especially Gram-negative rod infection, can be explained by several factors, such as exposure to high-risk procedures, use of glucocorticoids, severity of underlying diseases and frequent use of medical instruments, all of which may facilitate development of nosocomial bacteremia (12) , so appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment may be indicated for initial management of severe A H7N9 virus pneumonia. Glucocorticoids are used in all of our cases while they are still controversial in the routine treatment of influenza (13) (14) (15) . Because of the limited number of patients, our experiences are not conclusive; whether the continuous activity of virus replication is associated with glucocorticoid is unknown. Long-term complication of mechanical ventilation is pneumothorax. Yang and her colleagues (16) find that the incidence of pneumothorax in serious coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV] patients with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is significantly higher than that without receiving MV.
