The rate of meningococcal infection in our study was higher than previously described, both among all patients with PRF enrolled (0.5% \u2013 11%)1, 2, 3, 4 and also among all patients with proven bacterial etiology (4.2 \u2013 24%).2, 3 The overall mortality rate in our series was 10.2% and reached 16.7%% among the patients with PRF associated with a bacterial infection. Four of the 5 fatalities recorded in our series were due to proven meningococcal invasive disease and two additional fatalities were recorded in patients without recovery of any pathogen and a high suspicion of meningococcal disease, based on their clinical presentation and possible masking of the etiology by previous antibiotic therapy. In a study from 1989 enrolling 190 patients with PRF, 13 (7%) had meningococcal disease, but the most common bacterial association was with Streptococcus pyogenes (19 patients).2 Viral infections were documented in 28 patients. Patients with invasive bacterial disease appeared more ill, were more likely to have neck stiffness and were more likely to have petechiae on the lower extremities than those with no bacteremic disease. A higher peripheral white blood count and absolute band form count was found in the patient with invasive bacterial disease.2 Nguyen et al. reported in 1984 on 129 patients hospitalized with PRF in Syracuse, NY, and they found that 26 patients (20.2%) had culture-proven bacterial infection (13 and 8 had N. meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type B, respectively).1 As in our study, the authors could not document any single laboratory test as sensitive enough to detect all patients with life-threatening bacterial infections. Mandl et al. reported in 1997 on 411 patients with PRF examined at the emergency department of the Pediatric Teaching Hospital in Boston.3 Eight (1.9%) patients had bacteremia or clinical sepsis and 6 of them had serious invasive bacteremia (N. meningitidis recovered in 2 patients). None of the 357 well-appearing patients had serious invasive bacteremia. This study, by reporting invasive bacteremia less frequently than in previous series and being able to identify this condition by clinical criteria, supported the concept of the treatment of selected well-appearing children with PRF as outpatients.3 In a study examining 233 infants and children younger than 15 years presenting with a non-blanching rash during the period 1998 \u2013 1999 in the UK, 11% had proven meningococcal infection.4 The authors showed that most children with meningococcal infection were ill at presentation, had a purpuric rash, were febrile and had a delayed capillary refill. None of the children with a non-blanching rash confined to the distribution of the superior vena cava had meningococcal infection. In Israel, Ben-Shimol et al.12 described the dynamics of childhood invasive meningococcal disease during a 22-year period (1989 \u2013 2010). The authors reported on a total of 743 cases, 69.2% of them with meningitis and 30.8 with meningococcemia only. The mean annual incidence was 2 cases/100,000 children aged 0 \u2013 15 years, an incidence similar to those reported from other developed countries.12 The mean mortality incidence was 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 cases/100,000 children and this was higher in children without meningitis (14.9%) compared to children with meningitis (7.9%). In Israel, meningococcal vaccine was not introduced in the national immunization program and it is administered only to high-risk patients. It is understandable that preventive, rather than therapeutic strategies will have a major contribution to the decrease of the serious morbidity and mortality associated with invasive meningococcal disease.",

Therefore, taking into consideration the high rates of Rickettsial infections reported in Israel and particularly in the southern area of the country and into the Bedouin population, we consider that Rickettsial infection should be highly suspected, in our geographic area, in the initial investigation of patients presenting with PRF and empiric treatment has to be administered to the patients with a high index of suspicion for this disease.",

The authors reported that a viral pathogen was found in 67% of the PCR examinations performed from the nasopharynx.7 The most frequent pathogens associated with PRF were CMV and EBV (18% each of all patients) followed by enteroviruses and rotavirus (14% each) and H1N1 and human bocavirus (9% each); 41% of the patients were diagnosed with more than one viral pathogen. This study emphasizes that novel viral rapid detection methods (like multiplex q-PCR) are available and should be used in determining the possible viral etiology in a considerable number of patients with PRF and thereby avoiding unnecessary treatments and hospitalizations.",
