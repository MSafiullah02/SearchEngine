            "text": "Our statistical model showed that percentage of rural was positively correlated with the mortality rate of COVID-19. Moreover, the counties that are farm-dependent or mining-dependent have high mortality rate of COVID-19. One possible explanation could be that the medical systems in rural areas are not well equipped and prepared for the COVID-19 infection. This finding should be alarming since rural areas have limited medical resources to respond to this pandemic and treat COVID-19 patients 19 . Additional measures (such as professional health experts and wellequipped hospitals) should be taken before the COVID-19 becomes epidemic in rural areas.",

            "text": ", several health and demographic factors were significantly negatively correlated with the COVID-19 mortality rate in log scale at the population level. With the number of days since the first confirmed COVID-19 case increased, the mortality rate in log scale significantly decreased (b = -0.02041, 95% CI: -0.02612, -0.01470). The COVID-19 infection rate was significantly negatively correlated with the mortality rate in log scale (b = -44.12260, 95% CI: -58.21640, -30.02880). Higher percentage of vaccination significantly correlated with lower COVID-19 mortality rate in log scale (b = -0.01153, 95% CI: -0.01860, -0.00446). In contrast, the percentage of elders aged 65 and over was significantly positively correlated with the COVID-19 mortality rate in log scale (b = 0.04734, 95% CI: 0.03509, 0.05958). The percentage of rural was positively correlated with the mortality rate of COVID-19 in log scale (b = 0.00322, 95% CI: 0.00116, 0.00529). The correlation of population density with the COVID-19 mortality rate in log scale was positive and significant although the estimated coefficient is small (b = 0.00007, 95% CI: 0.00005, 0.00010). Compared to the counties with economic typology of \"Recreation\", the counties with \"Nonspecialized\", \"Farm-dependent\" or \"Mining-dependent\" had significantly higher COVID-19 mortality rate in log scale. Discussions With the pandemic of COVID-19, especially in the US, while it is of upmost importance to discover the underlying biological mechanisms of COVID-19 infection and further develop the effective vaccines and medication, it is important to understand what other factors can affect the infection and mortality of COVID-19. Here, at the population level, we investigated potential health and demographic factors with the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in US counties. Our statistical models showed that some health and demographic factors were positively correlated with the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 while others showed negative correlations. For example, the number of days since the first reported case in US counties was positively correlated with the infection rate but percentage of smokers was negatively correlated with the infection rate of COVID-19. While the infection rate of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with the mortality rate, percentage of elders (65 and over) was positively correlated with the COVID-19 mortality rate.",

With continuous spreading of COVID-19 in the US, the number of confirmed cases and deaths at different counties are increasing, and our models based on the most-updated COVID-19 data require continuous updating. Moreover, it remains unclear why some health factors were negatively correlated with the infection rate of COVID-19, such as percentage of adults with obesity, excessive drinking or food insecure. While our findings at the population level may require further validation using clinical data at the individual level, our study is the first one to investigate potential correlations of health and demographic factors with the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in US counties. While developing COVID-19 vaccines will be the most effective way to stop this COVID-19 pandemic, it is a time-consuming and expensive process 20 . The findings from this study may help us determine the potential impact of health and demographic factors on the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19, which could facilitate us to take effective measures to slow down the pandemic of COVID-19.",
