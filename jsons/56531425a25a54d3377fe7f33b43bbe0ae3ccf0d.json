This predisposition is primarily due to high error rate, and limited proofreading capability of the viral polymerase and by recombination. These characteristics make coronaviruses an interesting model system to study the mechanisms involved in viral evolution and the ways viruses adapt to switch host or to gain novel functions. Here we describe the protocol to estimate selection pressures for the spike gene and evolutionary dynamics of bovine coronaviruses.",

Although coronaviruses have been shown to possess proofreading ability [ 1 ] , relatively high mutation rates mean that coronaviruses are one of the most diverse, genetically distinct, and recently emerging groups of viruses. The emergence of these viruses are mainly triggered by the virus evolution which could occur due to high mutational rates, selection pressure on genetic diversity, interand intra-host selection, frequency of recombination, and genetic drifts during transmission bottlenecks. Within subfamily Coronaviridae , Alphacoronaviruses , and Betacoronaviruses infect and cause diseases in mammals, whereas Gammacoronaviruses are mainly avian specifi c [ 2 ] .",

BCoV causes infections both in respiratory and enteric systems in cattle of all ages. Like other coronaviruses, BCoV exhibit high genetic mutations (one mutation per genome per replication round) [ 4 , 5 ] . The nucleotide (nt) substitutions per site per year were found to be 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , 6.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , and 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), S, and N genes, respectively [ 6 -8 ] . Due to their evolutionary potential, BCoVs have been isolated from humans (BCoV-like human enteric coronavirus HECV-4408/US/94) and a recently isolated canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has also shown a high genetic similarity to Betacoronavirus1 [ 9 , 10 ] .",

Search the nucleotide sequences with objective-based keyword such as \"Bovine Coronaviruses S gene\". Manual editing and investigations of the downloaded sequences are always suggested. Notably, BLAST-Explorer is primarily aimed at helping the construction of sequence datasets for further phylogenetic study, and it can also be used as a standard BLAST server with enriched output.
