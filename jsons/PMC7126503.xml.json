            "text": "The properties of an approaching wind such as its wind speed, turbulence intensity, and direction are important for evaluating the pedestrian-level wind (PLW) field in an urban area. For example, when a wind flow with high ambient speed strikes a building, it tends to generate windy areas around it near the ground, causing discomfort to pedestrians [1]. Highly intense turbulence, on the other hand, has its advantages: for example, it increases the velocity of the horizontal wind component near the roof of a building, strengthening the street-canyon vortex, facilitating the removal of air pollutants from a street canyon [2]. Kastner-Klein and Plate [3] have demonstrated how pollutant concentration in a street canyon decreases with a change in wind direction from the perpendicular to the oblique and concluded that the effects of wind direction are of practical concern. Given that the properties of the approaching wind are important in assessing the wind environment in a built-up area, researchers have devoted significant time and effort on simulating the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind flows in a boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) [4], [5], [6] and on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations [7], [8], [9], [10].",

Particularly in an urban area, the accuracy of empirical models becomes low because of the complex morphology. For instance, the shape of the power-law wind model can become distorted because of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect [11] and the development of an internal boundary layer [12]. Similarly, the assumption of the constant wind direction along the profiles' height is doubtful in the urban wind field [13], [14]. Compared to wind speed and turbulence, the variation in wind directions has not received much attention even though several researchers, such as Kikumoto et al. [14] have emphasised that the deviation in wind directions should be replicated accurately in both physical and numerical simulations to obtain precise results when studying urban wind fields.",

Conversely, directional variations in a wind flow have not been systematically investigated in the field of wind engineering until very recent when Tse et al. [18], [19], [20] conducted a series of wind tunnel tests using twisted wind profiles. Tse et al. [18] first simulated twisted wind profiles, which have varying wind directions along the profile's height, in a BLWT and then used them for the wind tunnel tests to show the ways that twisted wind flows modify the PLW field near isolated buildings and arrays of buildings [19], [20]. Although these wind tunnel tests are indicative of the impact of twisted winds on the PLW field near generic buildings, it is not yet fully understood whether twisted wind profiles have similar importance in assessing the PLW field in an urban area. This uncertainty arises from the inherited characteristics of an urban area, including its inhomogeneous land use, irregular building arrangement, and non-uniform dimensions, shapes, and forms of buildings; all of them are vastly different from the generic buildings that were previously tested in twisted wind flows. Therefore, it is a timely need to conduct a comprehensive study on the urban PLW field under the influence of twisted winds to expand the existing knowledge. Moreover, such a study would be beneficial in fine-tuning the testing procedures of the urban PLW field such as the Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA) [21].",

The PLW fields at the site perimeter, along main highways, and near a group of high-rise buildings are analysed comprehensively to determine whether the twisted wind flows have significant impacts on the urban PLW field. These three test locations are indicative of the PLW fields under unobstructed wind flows (at the perimeter), wind penetration along main breezeways (along the highways), and wind conditions near buildings (the group of high-rise buildings) resulted in twisted wind flows and the variations in PLW fields with the properties of approaching wind flows.",

The vertical variation in flow directions is a result of the combined effects of Earth's rotation, friction between the wind and Earth's surface, and the pressure gradient force between high- and low-pressure zones [13]. The resulting wind profile is shaped like a spiral commonly known as the Ekman Spiral. The variation in wind direction within the Ekman Spiral is about 20\u00b0 on average but can vary from 10\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 between the heights in the range of 1\u20131.5 km in the ABL [25]. However, deviations in wind direction observed in field measurement campaigns are larger than the average deviation in wind direction of the Ekman Spiral and are confined to the lower altitudes in the ABL (as opposed to all along its height). For example, Wind-Lidar measurements taken by Pe\u00f1a et al. [13] reveal 25\u00b0-45\u00b0 deviations in wind direction under the neutral and stable atmospheric conditions while Kikumoto et al. [14] report about 70\u00b0 of the deviations in wind direction for the heights in between 67.5 m and 500 m from SODAR-Lidar measurements.",

Their analysis reveals that the absolute difference in wind directions between the full-scale measurement heights of 25 m and 500 m can be as large as 40\u00b0 irrespective to wind speeds, in which the yaw angles were measured. Apparently, the wind directional deviations observed from the wind tunnel tests are smaller than those reported by Pe\u00f1a et al. [13] and Kikumoto et al. [14]. Nevertheless, the deviation can still be considered as significant when considering that its magnitude is larger than that of the Ekman Spiral and the deviation is confined to the lower 500 m of the ABL. Based on the results of the wind tunnel tests and CFD simulations carried out by Weerasuriya et al. [26] and Li et al. [27], Tse et al. [18] conjecture that the hilly terrain of Hong Kong may generate large wind direction deviations in the lower part of the ABL. Consequently, the influence of the hilly terrain on the wind direction field should be included in the evaluation of the PLW field in Hong Kong for finding solutions for many wind-related issues, including outdoor thermal discomfort [28], degradation of air quality [29], increase of UHI effect [30], and favourable conditions for spreading airborne pathogens such as the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus [31]. Although the twisted wind profiles observed in Hong Kong are dependent of the underlying hilly terrain, atmospheric stability conditions, in particular, the stable atmospheric stability, can alter the properties of topography-induced twisted wind profiles such as the magnitude of yaw angle [32].",

The wind tunnel tests in this study were conducted in the low-speed section because of its large dimensions (5 m in width and 4 m in height) under its maximum operating wind speed of 10 m s\u22121 at 1 m height. The large dimensions of the test section are advantageous for simulating twisted wind profiles because flow reflections from the sidewalls of the wind tunnel are of a considerable concern.",

The higher wind speeds may be related to low turbulence intensity recorded at the test point E, where the largest deviation in turbulence intensity was observed. Compared with wind speed and turbulence intensity, yaw angles present noticeable variations in both longitudinal and lateral directions; more specifically, the magnitude of yaw angle decreased by 20%\u201330% from the upstream test point C to the downstream test point E. The variation in yaw angles in the lateral direction was dependent on the direction of the approaching wind near ground, such that the test point D had larger yaw angles in clockwise twisted wind flows, while the test point B recorded larger yaw angles in counter-clockwise twisted winds.

The K values in these directions are higher than 0.3, indicating that the wind conditions at the perimeter of this site are acceptable. The individual maxima of the wind flows' K values recorded at test point 12 are different: for example, while CWP's maximum K value is 0.37, the maximum K values of the four twisted wind flows are 0.36 in TWP13-CW, 0.34 in TWP22-CW, 0.40 in TWP13-ACW, and 0.37 in TWP22-ACW. The maximum K values of the twisted winds with clockwise yaw angles are smaller than the maximum K value of CWP at test point 12 but with counter-clockwise yaw angles, the twisted winds' maximum K values are larger than those of CWP. The directions where maximum K values are recorded (\u03c6\nKmax) are also slightly different between the twisted and conventional wind flows at test point 12. In fact, \u03c6\nKmax varies with the twisted wind flow's yaw angle. On the one hand, \u03c6\nKmax of TWP13-CW and TWP22-CW are 160\u00b0 and 150\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 smaller than \u03c6\nKmax of CWP (170\u00b0); on the other hand, \u03c6\nKmax values are same or larger for TWP13-ACW (170\u00b0) and TWP22-ACW (180\u00b0) than for CWP. The minimum of CWP's K value at test point 12 is about 0.03 and happens at 290\u00b0 resulting a difference in the maximum and minimum K values of CWP about 0.34 or an equivalent reduction of wind speed about 1.7 m s\u22121. The minimum K values of the twisted winds are observed in the same directions as in CWP (\u03c6\nKmin \u2248 290\u00b0 \u2013 310\u00b0) but the magnitudes are 4\u20139% higher than that of CWP. The constant \u03c6\nKmin of both twisted and conventional wind flows may be attributed to the high density of buildings upstream of test point 12 in directions between 230\u00b0 and 330\u00b0.",

The DW value of CWP shows a steady increase from about 49% at the windward end (418 m) to about 86% at the centre of the study area (0 m). Similarly, the twisted wind flows have increasing trends in DW but their DW values moderately deviate from the corresponding DW of CWP. In general, the DW values of the twisted winds with small yaw angles deviate less from those of CWP than the corresponding values of the twisted winds with large yaw angles. For example, the DW value of TWP13-ACW at test point 10 deviates only 1.4% from those of CWP while the corresponding deviation of TWP22-ACW is about 24%. The yaw direction is another factor that causes some deviations in DW values of test points. An example is that the DW values of test point 10 where TWP 22-CW has a 13.2% higher DW value than CWP while TWP22-ACW records a 24.9% smaller DW value. However, none of these trends in DW values is consistent for the twisted wind flows but is significantly varied or occasionally reversed at test points, for instance, at test point 11, TWP22-ACW's DW value is 6.3% smaller for than CWP opposed to higher DW at test point 10. These differences in DW value diminish as winds penetrate to the study area and eventually, all wind flows have comparable DW values at the centre. Test point 1 (at the centre of the study area) has high DW values, on average, of 85% for all wind flows with small individual deviations (about 2%). The similar DW values of both conventional and twisted wind flows may be related to the high density of buildings at the centre of the study area, overriding the influence of twisted winds on the PLW field at test point 1.",

For these two directions, test point 71 can be considered as located either upstream or downstream of the group of high-rise buildings. When test point 71 is in the upstream direction, all wind flows record their maximum K values. For instance, CWP has its maximum K value of 0.32 at 190\u00b0 and the four twisted winds record their maximum K values of 0.31\u20130.32 in directions ranging from 180\u00b0 to 200\u00b0. These maximum K values of the wind flows at test point 71 may be attributed to the intense backflow generated by the high-rise buildings when the buildings are exposed to winds that approach from directions 180\u00b0 to 200\u00b0. Then the variation of \u03c6\nKmax (i.e., the wind direction of the maximum K value) may be related to the modifications of upstream flow features by the twisted winds as discussed by Tse et al. [20]. The second peak in K value, which is marginally less than 0.3, is found at 0\u00b0, for which the location of test point 71 is downstream of the group of high-rise buildings. When test point 71 is in the downstream direction, it may be subjected to accelerated wind flows that move from the windward sides of the medium-rise buildings located next to the test point to the leeward sides of high-rise buildings. In contrast at 190\u00b0, the maximum K values of the wind flows do not show a strong dependence at 0\u00b0 because of the local flow circulations govern the wind conditions at the test point than the undisturbed wind flow that approaches the site. The high K values in the directions between 180\u00b0 to 200\u00b0 indicate likely the existence of the acceptable wind conditions at test point 71 for these wind directions. Nevertheless, the overall wind condition at test point 71 can be categorised as low wind speed (LWS) for all wind flows as evinced by their average K values (i.e.K\u00af=\u2211i=136Ki(\u03c6)/36), which is considerably smaller than 0.3. The LWS condition is likely related to low ambient wind speeds in Hong Kong, which in turn, do not generate unpleasant or dangerous high-speed winds near high-rise buildings as reported by many studies in the literature [39], [40], [41], [42].",

The K values of five winds are considerably different at 190\u00b0 and 10\u00b0, for instance, the K values are within the range of 0.15\u20130.22 at 10\u00b0 while the corresponding K values are 0.27\u20130.33 for the oncoming winds from 190\u00b0.

The interpretation of the results of this study requires certain concerns as listed below;\u2022The wind profiles employed in this study had similar wind speeds and turbulence intensities but dissimilar yaw angles because the goal of this study is to investigate the variation of wind speed in an urban site with the magnitude and direction of yaw angles of oncoming wind profiles. However, in field conditions, wind profiles approach the site in different directions may have different wind speeds and turbulence intensities, which are likely to affect the wind conditions at the site. Therefore, all the flow parameters including wind speeds, turbulence intensity, and yaw angles should be considered for a comprehensive analysis of the PLW field in an urban site.\u2022The fine resolution with 10\u00b0 increments of wind incidence angle gives an impression of a gradual variation of K value with wind incidence angle for the four twisted wind flows. However, in engineering applications such as AVA, a limited number of wind incidence angles (e.g. 16 wind directions in AVA) are tested, and therefore, the gradual variation of K value cannot be clearly identified. Moreover, the abrupt changes in K values in few wind directions can cause significant discrepancies in the result of a PLW field when it is assessed for different wind flows.\u2022In this study, the K value is calculated by assuming that the probability of occurrence of wind is same for all 36 directions. However, in field conditions, some directions are prevalent with high probabilities of occurrence of wind while other directions have low probabilities. An unequal distribution of probabilities makes the wind condition at a location strongly dependent on the approaching wind direction. For instance, a small difference in K values in a prevalent wind direction can cause a larger variation in the wind condition at a test point than the predictions of this study.\n",

Compared with wind speeds in a conventional wind flow, the twisted winds can cause more than 35% difference in wind speeds at locations that have a low density of buildings or are exposed to the unobstructed winds that approach the site. In general, the high density of buildings overrides the influence of yaw angles on the PLW fields resulting less than 10% differences in wind speeds in the five wind flows. Nevertheless, PLW fields near high-rise buildings vary with the yaw angles of oncoming wind flows registering more than 100% differences in wind speeds among twisted and conventional wind flows. The wind speeds at the roadside test points strongly depend, as indicated by 0\u201345% difference in wind speeds, on the magnitude and direction of the yaw angle of the oncoming wind. As a result, the wind penetration along the main roads are different for the conventional and twisted wind flows. However, the directions, where the maximum and minimum K values are found (\u03c6\nKmax and \u03c6\nKmin) for the four twisted winds vary with the direction of the yaw angle but do not display an obvious relationship with the magnitude of the corresponding yaw angles at the pedestrian level. This suggests another probable relationship that can be existed between the yaw angle and the \u03c6\nKmax (or the \u03c6\nKmin) that is still an unknown. The existence of such a relationship is intended to investigate in a future study because it is advantageous in understanding and predicting the flow modifications in PLW field under the influence of twisted wind flows.",
