Tobacco smoke exposure results in inflammatory processes in the lung, increased mucosal inflammation, expression of inflammatory cytokines and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, increased permeability in epithelial cells, mucus overproduction, and impaired mucociliary clearance. 1 Knowledge about host factors, and in particular avoidable host factors such as smoking, may be of importance in reducing viral contamination and the severity of the disease.",

To the best of our knowledge and at the time of the writing of this Commentary, six published case series reported the prevalence of smoking among individuals with COVID-19 ( Table 1 ). The study with the highest number of patients compared severe (N = 173) to nonsevere (N = 926) cases. The percent of current and former smokers were higher among the severe cases: 17% and 5%, respectively, than among the nonsevere cases (12% and 1%, respectively). 2 More importantly, among those with the primary composite end point (admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death), the proportion of smokers was higher with than among those without this end point (26% vs. 12%). 2 Another case series also showed more smokers among the severe (N = 58) than among the nonsevere (N = 82) cases. 3 The single modifiable host factor associated with progression of COVID-19 pneumonia was current smoking in a multivariable logistic analysis (odds ratio = 14.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.6-25.0). 4 Among those who died the number of smokers was also been found to be somewhat higher (9%, 5/54) than among survivors (6%, 9/137). 5 Vardavas and Nikitara's recent systematic review 8 identified five studies 2-6 and concluded that \"smoking is most likely associated with negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.\" Conversely, Lippi and Henry's short meta-analysis reported no association of smoking status with severity of COVID-19. 9 However, the number of cases in most studies to date is very low, and consequently the 95% confidence intervals very wide.",

Both are abundant in mucosal epithelial cells and lung alveolar tissue and have multiple physiological functions. To infect the host, both viruses attach to its receptor: MERS-CoV to DPP4 and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, a probably key step for coronavirus infections.",

ACE2 gene expression was also higher in small and large airway epithelia of healthy ever smokers compared with never smokers: current smokers had the highest expression, never smokers had the lowest expression; recent former smokers (\u226415 years) had higher ACE2 gene expression than nonsmokers but not long-term former smokers (>15 years). 14 The similar upregulation associated with smoking of two different virus receptors observed with two different coronaviruses suggests that smoking contributes to the higher number of viral receptors and may support the findings of the recent case series observations.",
