            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic coronavirus that has a tendency to cause significant healthcare outbreaks among patients with serious comorbidities. We analyzed hospital data from the MERS-CoV outbreak in King Abdulaziz Medical Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, June-August 2015 using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) ward transmission model. The SEIR compartmental model considers several areas within the hospital where transmission occurred. We use a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the following units: emergency department (ED), out-patient clinic, intensive care unit, and hospital wards, where each area has its own carrying capacity and distinguishes the transmission by three individuals in the hospital: patients, health care workers (HCW), or mobile health care workers. The emergency department, as parameterized has a large influence over the epidemic size for both patients and health care workers. Trend of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end, shows that until added hospital controls are introduced, the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards. Transmission rates where highest in the ED, and mobile HCWs were responsible for large part of the outbreak.",

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) classified the following countries in the Middle East as \"at-risk\" for MERS-CoV: Bahrain, Jordan, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine [3] .

The incubation period ranges from 2-13 days with a median of 5 days. MERS-CoV presents as a combination of non-specific symptoms such as cough, fever (\u226538 \u2022 C), dyspnea, diarrhea, and vomiting [5] . To distinguish a probable or confirmed case, a combination of symptoms and lab-confirmed data is necessary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define two categories of laboratory tests used to detect MERS-CoV: (1) molecular tests, which look for active infection; and (2) serology tests, which look for previous infection [6] . Most, if not all hospitals, use real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays to define a confirmed case following CDC's standard. The CDC recommends conducting multiple tests on each patient. A single negative rRT-PCR would classify a patient as under investigation, or as a possible case. A second negative would classify the patient as MERS negative [6] . The Saudi Ministry of Health has adopted strict case definitions for the hospitals and created a wave of auditing and inspections to the hospitals to ensure compliance with infection control practices to prevent further healthcare outbreaks.",

Under IDEP Phase I MERS-CoV cases requiring intubation were placed into negative pressure isolation rooms and were cohorted in one intensive-care unit (ICU). All hospital services continued without interruptions except for MERS patients' precautions in the designated ICU. IDEP Phase II included several actions including (1) conversion of an entire ward into a negative pressure, isolation unit for the treatment of suspected and confirmed non-ICU cases; (2) restricting visitors entering the hospital; (3) reducing the number of elective surgeries; (4) implementing contact tracing to unprotected health care workers (HCWs) and staff; and (5) ensuring mask and PPE fit testing for HCWs in high risk areas.

The disease dynamics in the ED, in particular, have a high influence over the whole healthcare outbreak (Figure 3a) . The sensitivity bar graph (Figure 3a) shows that fast increase in the sizes of the epidemics would follow from the increase in the transmission rates in the ED. Consistently, they would also increase with the increase in the length of stay in the ED (or equivalently to the decrease in the transition rates out of the ED to the ICU, hospital wards, or isolation). Moreover, they increase with the rates of becoming symptomatic due to the isolation of symptomatic infectious patients, in general, and out of the ED, in particular; noting that asymptomatic patients are still infectious but to a lesser degree. Additionally, increasing the relative reduction of infectiousness from the HCWs to patients may be due to the lack of gloves and gowns, would increase the sizes of the epidemics.

Factors such as long-stays in the ED and high mobility of infected patients due to lack of early recognition and diagnosis of the virus contributed to the healthcare acquired infections spread and transmission between gulf cities.

That would assist in identifying the most infectious ward. It also quantifies the role of the different individuals in the disease spread. The small number of people in each ward and state might be a problem when using a deterministic model and a stochastic model is warranted; however, the strength of the disease without the control measures was a main factor in our selection.",
