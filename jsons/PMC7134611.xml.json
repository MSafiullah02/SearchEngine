Uneven development is entrenched, the gulf between rich and poor countries is widening, and rampant poverty continues to haunt millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n1\n",

Singapore, for instance, within a single generation raised her per real capita GDP from 20% of that of the United States of America in 1960 to 88% in 2000.

One is Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1997), which argues that \u201cAt the early stages of development, the presence of indivisible projects limits the degree of risk spreading (diversification) that the economy can achieve. [\u2026] \u2018Lucky\u2019 countries will spend relatively less time in the primitive accumulation stage and develop faster\u201d (p. 709, italics added). Indivisibility is certainly a problem for small countries, and each of the four NIEs is small. Singapore, for instance, is a small city state that deals with indivisibility by targeted-investment policies. Largely as a result of her government\u2019s economic development policy, 42.1% of her total manufacturing output in 2002 came from a single sector of electronic products and components, even though this proportion had fallen from 48.9% in 1997. Similar stories can be told of Taiwan\u2019s targeting basic industries such as glass, plastics, steel and cement (see Wade, 1990, p. 78), and of Korea\u2019s targeting shipbuilding, cement, and steel (see Amsden, 1990 and Jones & Sekong, 1980). Applying Acemoglu and Zilibotti\u2019s hypothesis that \u201cchance will always play a key role in his [Prometheus\u2019] unchaining\u201d (p. 711), these NIEs must have hit the jackpot by choosing the growth industries. These Asian countries could, according to the Acemoglu\u2013Zilibotti hypothesis, easily have betted on the wrong horse. They have been lucky; things could have been much worse.",

They conclude that \u201c\u2026 luck is important relative to policies in determining the long-run path of output\u201d (1993, p. 476). Not only do Easterly and his co-authors assert that luck is important, but that growth policy is not. Thus they write, \u201cThe finding that much variation in growth rates is due to random shocks should induce caution in attributing high growth rates to good policy (or to a good \u2018work ethic\u2019). Just as a baseball star is dubbed a clutch hitter after a lucky hit, some so-called economic miracles are likely due to random variation\u201d (1993, p. 481, italics added). The \u201cmiracles\u201d they refer to are the four high-flying Asian NIEs, which Easterly in another paper predicts \u201cshould be heading back toward earth soon\u201d (1995, p. 283). Sure enough, merely two years after Easterly wrote this, all four NIEs headed \u201cback toward earth\u201d in the form of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. They did not stay on earth for very long though, and they quickly rebounded to above-average growth rates until, in 2003, another shock hit them (except Korea) in the form of a deadly virus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The Asian NIEs have been lucky, but perhaps their luck is finally running out.",

Consequently, we have to be careful in order not to reduce our enquiry to a state of quagmire. Luck is often associated with fate, even superstition; a student may think that he did well in an examination paper because he wore his \u201clucky T-shirt\u201d that day. Such prosaicism must be excluded from our discussion. Furthermore, any theory based on luck is intellectually distasteful since it can never be falsified. For instance, we can never disprove that the student\u2019s T-shirt brought him \u201cluck\u201d that day. By the same token, we can never disprove that Asian NIEs\u2019 growth performance was due to \u201cluck\u201d at least in some ways. Even though a luck-theory, by its incapacity of being falsified falls within the Popperian realm of \u201cnon-science,\u201d it is still enlightening, meaningful, and indeed crucial to consider how it may help us to understand growth. Luck is by definition unknowable. However, we could find out how luck evolves amid economic volatility, and thence infer the role of good luck and good policy in (NIEs) growth. After all, the history of human civilization is the history of knowing the unknown and of reducing our realm of ignorance, much of which we unwittingly assign to luck.",

As the only star performers for almost a half century, the NIEs have carried the hopes of many poor nations in the world. China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and a host of Asian countries have begun lately to emulate the four NIEs with various degrees of success. \u201cHow to make a miracle\u201d\n4 is without doubt the most encapsulating question today, but much hope will sadly be dashed if the NIE miracles are merely freak results from a lucky draw. If the NIE\u2019s growth really were freak results from a lucky draw, then poor countries should forget about learning from the Asian examples, but instead try to improve their fortune through other means.",

As explained earlier, disproving the luck-hypothesis is an impossible mission; this is not the purpose of this paper. Our aim is instead twofold. First, we need to dispel the widespread misconception that the Asian NIEs have had a smooth ride all the way. The fact is the contrary\u2014they have had to endure more than their fair share of volatility along their growth path. Second, we argue (in Section 4) that even luck is endogenous. Luck always favours those who work hard, not as an article of faith, but as a consequence of learning-by-doing and learning-by-investing. The Asian NIE\u2019s high degree of volatility was a consequence of their intensive investment policy (see Section 3); their luck and fortune are spin-offs from their toil and dexterity. Our recommendation to poor countries is to formulate good investment and growth policies now, as luck will take the side of those who strive.",

In manufacturing, poor-country workers are unskilled and produce labor intensive, technologically well-diffused commodities. Widely available substitutes and intense competition increase demand elasticities for their outputs.
