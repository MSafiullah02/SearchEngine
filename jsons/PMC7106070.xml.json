A series by Basi et al [7] that included 2,706 patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia similarly showed that 911 patients (one-third) had radiographic findings initially interpreted as negative for pneumonia, with minimal change in these interpretations on retrospective review of a random subgroup. The groups with positive and negative radiographic findings had similar rates of positive sputum cultures and blood cultures.

Navigante et al [10] found a similarly low incidence (2.3%) of pneumonia on chest radiography in febrile neutropenic patients without clinical suspicion of pneumonia from history or physical examination. Heussel et al [11] evaluated the utility of thin-section CT in a group of febrile neutropenic patients with normal or nonspecific chest radiographic findings. There were 146 episodes in 87 patients. Among the 14% with nonspecific chest radiographic findings, CT suggested pneumonia in all. Forty-eight percent had normal findings on chest radiography but computed tomographic findings of pneumonia. Of these, specific pathogens were identified in 43%. Both chest radiographic and computed tomographic findings were normal in 38%. The computed tomographic findings changed patients' therapy in 18%. Maertens et al [12] proposed an algorithm using CT in conjunction with galactomannan assays to select patients for high-dose antifungal therapy and performed a feasibility study assessing patients with 117 episodes of neutropenic fever. When the algorithm with CT was used, only 4.4% of patients received antifungal therapy. Hachem et al [13] retrospectively analyzed computed tomographic scans and autopsy results in 96 cancer patients who died of pneumonia and found that the presence of nodules in neutropenic patients and cavitary lesions in nonneutropenic patients was highly associated with fungal infection.",

Findings on chest radiography are among several parameters used to determine 1) which patients should be hospitalized (presence of pleural effusion), 2) which patients should be classified as having severe pneumonia (multilobar involvement), and 3) which patients may require additional diagnostic testing (cavitation, pleural effusion), including thoracentesis (pleural effusions >5 cm on lateral upright radiography) [14]. Computed tomography may show findings in patients with normal radiographic findings, but the significance of these findings and therefore the utility of CT in patients with clinically suspected pneumonia and negative radiographs are unclear [14]. Computed tomography may play a role in the management of severe pneumonia (Variant 6). It can serve as a guide for pleural drainage or localize an appropriate site for biopsy [15]. Severe pneumonias bear a strong relationship to etiologic pathogens and have implications for antimicrobial treatment. Patients with severe pneumonia should be considered as candidates for admission to an intensive care unit.",

Heckerling [2] reported that patients with acute asthma rarely have pneumonia. Findley and Sahn [17] recommended chest radiography only when pneumonia or pneumothorax is suspected (Variant 8).

There is literature supporting the utility of chest radiography in patients with known or suspected SARS (Variant 11). Wong et al [20] and Paul et al [21] described the chest radiographic findings of SARS during the Hong Kong and Toronto epidemics. Chest radiographic findings were abnormal in 78% to 80% of patients at presentation. The most common chest radiographic finding was unifocal opacity with a peripheral and basilar predominance. Multifocal or diffuse opacities could be present initially or develop as the disease progressed. Patients whose disease progressed were generally older, had more comorbidities, and had a higher fatality rate. Cavitation, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy were not features of SARS. Antonio et al [22] studied 1,373 patients in Hong Kong with SARS and found a sensitivity for disease of 82.4% on initial chest radiographs; they also concluded that the initial extent of radiographic opacification had prognostic value and that the rate of radiographic progression could be used as a prognostic indicator.",

During the 20th century, a number of countries developed weapon-grade anthrax to be used as a biologic warfare agent [26]. Much of modern medical experience with it arises from a Soviet military accident in 1979 in which 42 people died of anthrax and from cases of anthrax that developed in the US in 2001 as a result of biologic warfare. Anthrax comes in 3 forms: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalational. Ninety-five percent of anthrax is cutaneous, but the inhalational form is the most deadly. Inhalation of anthrax spores leads to hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis, sometimes accompanied by necrotizing pneumonia (Variant 12\n). The chest radiographic findings [26, 27] include widened mediastinum and hila, often accompanied by pleural effusions and parenchymal opacities. Earls et al [27] described the computed tomographic findings in two patients who survived inhalational anthrax. The computed tomographic characteristics were very suggestive of the diagnosis and included hyperattenuating hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hemorrhagic pleural effusion. Less specific findings included mediastinal edema, peribronchial thickening, and pleural effusion.",

It seems that in patients with ARI who are aged <40 years, chest radiography is not routinely indicated unless there are other abnormalities, positive results on physical examination, or other risk factors. It also seems that chest radiography is not indicated in most patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including asthma), unless there is a suspected complication such as pneumonia or pneumothorax or unless \u22651 of the following is present: leukocytosis, chest pain, edema, or a history of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.

Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other coexistent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the US Food and Drug Administration have not been considered in developing these criteria, but the study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged.
