The surveillance system focuses on the four most common types of HAIs in ICU patients as identified by data from the first year of Egypt\u2019s HAI surveillance program [14, 15]: bloodstream infections (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), and surgical site infections (SSI).

Cases of HAI with a culture growing an Enterobacteriaceae from a blood, urine, respiratory tract, or surgical site were included in this analysis. CRE cases were HAIs with Enterobacteriaceae isolates resistant to at least one of the following carbapenems: imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem [17]. CSE cases were HAIs with Enterobacteriaceae isolates not resistant to any of these carbapenems. This analysis was focused on the most common Enterobacteriaceae pathogens according to existing AMR data from Egypt, and included Klebsiella spp (only K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca aggregated, but not other rare species), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp [18].",

To identify cases, the hospital SC screens ICU patients for new clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of infection (fever, crackles, cough, etc.) at least 3 days per week by reviewing medical records, interviewing physicians, and reviewing diagnostic test results (microbiology results or radiology reports). When microbiology results are not available, the physician requests appropriate specimens to be collected for microbiology testing. When a patient is suspected of a HAI based on signs, symptoms, or diagnostic test results, patient information is entered into a standardized case report form installed on the electronic device. The device automatically analyzes the entered data to determine whether the patient meets the HAI case definition and if so, specifies the type of infection. Denominator data (i.e., patient-days, central line\u2013days, urinary catheter\u2013days, ventilator-days) are entered daily on a standardized denominator reporting form installed on the device. The clinical and epidemiological HAI data are uploaded weekly to a secured web-based surveillance application [15] . HAI microbiological data produced by the AMR reference laboratory are also uploaded to the web application, where the data are merged with the HAI clinical and epidemiological data. The web application has built in data quality checks and analytic tools for immediate data cleaning and analysis, which allows hospital teams to generate automated individualized facility reports.",
