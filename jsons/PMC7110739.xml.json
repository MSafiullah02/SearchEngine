During the animal rescue, animals are often triaged onsite and then transported to a temporary shelter to await their legal disposition. If the owner loses legal custody of the animals, they might be adopted, transferred to other agencies, or euthanased. Historically, the high prevalence of infectious diseases and lack of socialization of cats seized in large-scale cases often resulted in mass euthanasia in shelters already crowded by pet overpopulation.1, 2\nIn recent years, responding agencies have invested in the physical and behavioral rehabilitation of seized animals to reduce their euthanasia.3\nThis has increased the number of animals eventually placed in homes and the cost of intervening in suspected cruelty cases. The costs have exceeded $1\u20132 million4\nin the largest cases.5, 6\n",

They may act as primary pathogens or exert their effects only in combination with other infectious co-factors (Randolph et al., 1993). Mycoplasma infection has been significantly associated with feline URI in animal shelters, but most affected cats also carried co-infections such as FHV (Bannasch, Foley, 2005, Veir et al, 2008, Hartmann et al, 2010, Holst et al, 2010, Burns et al, 2011, Litster et al, 2012).

FHV persists as a latent infection in cats and can recrudesce during periods of stress (Gaskell et al., 2007). As a consequence of stress and cross-contamination, FHV is the most prevalent viral pathogen in cats with acute URI in traditional short-term shelter housing (Bannasch, Foley, 2005, Veir et al, 2008, McManus et al, 2014). In contrast to cats in short-term shelters, foster programs, or trap\u2013neuter\u2013return programs, cats housed long-term in sanctuaries are more likely to be infected with FCV than FHV, similar to the findings of cats from the cases in this report (McManus et al., 2014). The high prevalence of FCV among cats with URI is concerning because of considerable strain variability in its pathogenicity, transmissibility, and environmental stability and its association with a wide array of clinical signs including fever, conjunctivitis, oral ulceration, limping, ocular and nasal discharge, and gingivostomatitis (Reubel et al, 1992, Dawson et al, 1994, Pedersen et al, 2000, Radford et al, 2007, Gerriets et al, 2012). The reason for the shift from high prevalence of FHV in cats in short-term shelter housing to high prevalence of FCV in cats in long-term group-housed confinement is unknown (Reubel et al, 1992, Lommer, Verstraete, 2003, Dowers et al, 2010).",

SEZ was reported as the causative agent of death in 78 cats from June 2006 to January 2008 in an Israeli cattery (Blum et al., 2010). The common finding of SEZ in cats in large-scale cases could explain in part why URI appears to be more severe and even deadly in such circumstances, in contrast to the milder and self-limiting URI commonly associated with cats in short-term shelters in which SEZ does not appear to be commonly involved. SEZ is likely an under-recognized cause of severe disease in cats since screening is not currently included in routine laboratory test panels, and the clinical presentation is different to the dramatic hemorrhagic respiratory disease observed in dogs.",

T. foetus is often not identified, or misdiagnosed as Giardia spp. on fecal flotation, which is an important consideration because 67% of cats infected with T. foetus in this study were co-infected with Giardia spp.",

PCR testing should be repeated after treatment is finished to assure treatment success.

However, retroviral-infected cats were identified in each of the facilities, often group-housed with uninfected cats. The retroviral prevalence of cats from these cases surpasses infection rates reported for both pet and feral cats (Luria et al, 2004, Levy et al, 2006). This can be attributed to the increased physical contact, stress, and agonistic interactions between cats living in densely populated confinement. All cats should be tested for retroviruses at the time of seizure from hoarding cases as the retroviral status of cats will influence housing decisions, medical care, and adoption options. Cats should also be retested 2 months after the initial testing to identify early infections that escaped detection at the time of intake.",

Its management is particularly challenging when sheltering large numbers of seized cats, because of the potential transmission of Microsporum canis in temporary shelters to both cats and to humans. Due to prior difficulties in managing dermatophytosis cases in temporary shelters, in case 4 all cats were dipped in lime-sulfur at intake to decrease the overall spore burden in the shelter and to reduce in-shelter transmission of disease. Cats that exhibited lesions suspected to be dermatophytosis were immediately segregated. Cats with skin lesions, Wood's lamp positive examinations, or culture-confirmed dermatophytosis were treated with terbinafine and lime-sulfur dips. This protocol was effective in eliminating infections in all treated cats.",

It is also an ideal empirical treatment for many commonly encountered conditions in cats seized from hoarding cases, including wounds, pyoderma, and otitis. Unfortunately, cefovecin is ineffective against other common bacterial pathogens encountered in cats with URI, such as M. felis, B. bronchiseptica, and C. felis. This means that effective treatment of cats with URI often requires combination therapy with other antibiotics such as doxycycline. Doxycycline should not be used alone for therapy however, as SEZ isolates are frequently resistant to doxycycline (Chalker et al., 2012).",

These findings can be used to guide preventive care protocols, but much more knowledge is needed to inform comprehensive management tactics for such cases, especially since hoarding is being reported with increasing frequency. Currently, intervention strategies tend to center on emergency management of individual situations, and there is little follow-up or transparency regarding case outcomes. Prospective research is needed to more fully characterize the infectious diseases present in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cats and the effectiveness of preventive care and treatment protocols. Additional topics deserving attention include the management of stress and pain in seized cats, the characterization and management of common noninfectious conditions, and the long-term outcomes of the cats. Case managers should prioritize these factors during incident response planning. This will enable the development of best-practice guidelines and cost:benefit analyses to guide responders across the industry and to continuously improve outcomes for rescued cats.",
