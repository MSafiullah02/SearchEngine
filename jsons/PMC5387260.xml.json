Only 54 consumer products claimed to contain nanomaterials in 2005, but the number has surged to more than 1600 today [1]. It has been estimated that of all the nanomaterials manufactured, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have the highest degree of commercialization [2], owing largely to their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities against bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including HIV and SARS [3, 4]. Currently, a large variety of consumer products contain AgNPs, including food packaging materials, dietary supplements, cosmetics, textiles, electronics, household appliances, medical devices, water disinfectants, and room sprays [5].",

Data from in vitro studies demonstrated that AgNPs induce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, ultimately leading to inflammation, apoptosis, and cell death [6, 7]. In addition, in vivo studies [8\u201310] demonstrated that AgNPs enter the blood circulation and accumulate in organs including the brain, kidneys, lungs, spleen, testes and primarily the liver. The ability of AgNPs to enter the blood stream [10] and cross through the blood\u2013brain barrier [11] points toward the potential of these nanoparticles to migrate into the uterus, placenta and embryo thus causing developmental toxicity [12].",

An in vitro test has been developed over two decades ago to evaluate embryotoxicity of chemical compounds using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) [14]. The so-called embryonic stem cell test (EST) was latterly validated by the European Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) [15] and is currently used in the pharmaceutical industry [16]. In addition, implementing toxicogenomics into the EST improves its application domain and predictability [17], and has been shown as a promising alternative method for developmental toxicity testing [18]. Despite these progresses, only a few studies reported the toxicity of AgNPs in ESCs [19\u201321]. Moreover, little is known about the mechanisms of AgNP toxicity in ESCs at the molecular level.",

[22] found in an in vitro intestinal epithelium coculture model that treatment with AgNPs induced regulation of the same set of genes as with silver nitrate (AgNO3), and 6\u201317% of the silver content in the AgNPs suspensions was found in the ionic form (Ag+). The authors therefore speculated that the observed gene regulation was exerted by Ag+ released from the AgNPs. On the other hand, other studies suggest that AgNP toxicity is related to Ag+ and to the nanosize as well [23, 24]. Thus, AgNP cytotoxicity is a complex phenomenon and more research is needed to distinguish cellular effects triggered by the nanosized particle from those by Ag+ released from the nanoparticles.",

Using microarrays, we characterized transcriptomic changes induced by citrate-coated 20 nm AgNPs during spontaneous differentiation of a C57BL/6-derived mESC cell line. This cell line has been demonstrated to detect global gene expression changes induced by a variety of developmental toxicants [18]. To our knowledge, no toxicogenomic study on AgNPs has been reported hitherto in ESCs. We also compared the gene expression changes to those induced by Ag+ (silver acetate). We evaluated the potential toxicity of AgNPs with emphasis on oxidative stress and apoptosis by correlating cellular responses to gene expression patterns, which provides a mechanistic understanding of the toxicity of AgNPs in ESCs.",

After 3 days, EBs formed in the hanging drops were subsequently transferred into 6-cm bacteriological Petri dishes (Becton\u2013Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and were exposed to AgNPs or Ag+. The EBs had an average diameter of 330\u2013350 \u03bcm.",

As is typical for nanomaterials, the hydrodynamic diameter of the AgNPs in water measured by DLS was found to be slightly larger (29.3 nm) than the physical diameter measured by TEM (20.4 nm). The hydrodynamic diameter increased substantially in the medium (78.6 nm) (Fig. 1c), probably due to slight agglomeration. Two small peaks appeared in the low diameter range on the DLS plot, probably resulted from protein species found in the media. The AgNPs had a low PDI (0.048) in water but much higher (0.349) in medium, indicating good stability in water but not in the culture medium. UV\u2013Vis analysis in media (Fig. 1d) revealed colloidal homogeneity at the beginning (0 h) as reflected in the surface plasmon resonance with a characteristic peak ~400 nm. However, the peak intensity decreased rapidly within the first 2 h and then slowly between 2 and 8 h, with the peak broadened and shifted towards higher wavelengths, suggesting agglomeration of the particles in the medium. After 8 h, no further decrease in peak intensity was observed, although the peak position further shifted from 408 nm (8 h) to 424 nm (24 h).\n\n",

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the microarray data showed that the biological triplicates of each treatment group (control, AgNP, and Ag+) clustered roughly together and separated from one another except for the replicates of 1.0 \u00b5g/ml Ag+ (Fig. 3b). Two of the replicates fell in the same area with the controls, but the remaining one fell close to the 5.0 \u00b5g/ml Ag+ samples, far away from the other two. Due to the divergence between the replicates of the 1.0 \u00b5g/ml Ag+ treatment group, they were excluded from further analysis. For the remainder of this report, treatment with 5.0 \u00b5g/ml Ag+ will be simply referred to as treatment with Ag+. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) clustered the rest of the triplicates into respective treatment groups (Fig. 3c). In addition, the HCA indicated that the gene expression pattern of the samples treated with AgNPs was more related to that of the controls than to that of the Ag+-treated samples.\n",

The complex interactions between heterologous cell types result in the induction of differentiation of stem cells to derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers [36]. Therefore, ESC differentiation in EBs has been considered to faithfully recapitulate stages of early embryo development and is increasingly used as an in vitro model for developmental toxicity testing [13]. In addition, implementing toxicogenomics in ESC differentiation has been shown as a sensitive method for the detection of a variety of developmental toxicants [18]. In the present study, we characterized transcriptomic changes induced by citrate-coated 20 nm AgNPs during spontaneous differentiation of mESCs, and compared to those induced by Ag+ (silver acetate) under otherwise identical conditions. Despite the large differences in the numbers of DEGs, functional annotation and pathway analysis of the regulated genes revealed overall similarities between AgNPs and Ag+. Functions and pathways related to embryonic development and metabolism appeared on top of the lists for both treatments. Functional changes related to metabolism are thought to be necessary for cells to cope with the toxic insult of AgNPs and Ag+ [37]. Those related to embryonic development suggest that both AgNPs and Ag+ have the potential to cause developmental toxicities when in contact with the differentiating embryo. It has been reported that AgNPs induce distinct developmental defects in zebrafish embryos [38]. In a recent in vivo study, it was found that silver acetate exposure caused adverse effects on reproduction and postnatal development in rats [39].",

Several studies demonstrated that certain nanoparticles can penetrate the placenta barrier, reach the fetus, and evoke embryotoxic effects [40]. Since the application of AgNPs is expected to further increase in the future, long term exposure and potential accumulation of AgNPs in the human body may result.

This is because complex interactions exists between a particle and its surrounding microenvironment, including attractive or repulsive forces between particles, and between particles and biological substances in the dispersion medium such as salts (ions) and proteins. These factors affect both the hydrodynamic size and the surface charge of the nanoparticles, and can impact on their agglomeration status, which may in turn affect the extent of toxicity. It has been considered that larger agglomerates of nanoparticles are less toxic than monodispersed particles or smaller aggregates [41]. The DLS and UV\u2013Vis data suggest there was a dynamic interplay between the AgNPs and the culture medium, starting immediately upon contact and lasting throughout the duration of the exposure, leading to increased agglomeration of the AgNPs. Aggregation of nanoparticles in cell culture media has been reported previously by others [19, 37, 40]. However, it has to be noted that there are significant limitations to the techniques used for the characterization, which complicates the interpretation of the data. For both DLS and UV\u2013Vis, characteristic peaks for AgNPs overlaps with those of the medium. Moreover, it is well known that DLS is a weight-averaged measurement biased towards larger particle sizes and especially towards agglomerates or aggregates. Thus, although the observed DLS curve showed an average hydrodynamic size of ~78 nm, the system may actually contain a very high number of smaller particles that are bioavailable and can interact with the ESCs. From another point of view, it should be pointed out that the agglomeration of AgNPs found here does not diminish, but rather adds to, the significance of the current study. Since the culture medium for ESCs used here was similar to body fluid in composition, it is likely that AgNPs entering the human body would agglomerate to some extent. In this sense, the results found in the current study are meaningful for real life situations. Since unagglomerated (monodispersed) form of nanoparticles would be more toxic than their agglomerated form, the results reported here signify the importance of nanoparticle regulation in consumer products.",

At 5.0 \u03bcg/ml, Ag+ caused nearly complete cell death (97%) in adherent culture, while >80% cells survived in EBs. For AgNPs, cell viability at 5.0 \u03bcg/ml was 68% in adherent culture and 87% in EB state. At 50 \u00b5g/ml, 73 and 34% cells remained alive after exposure to AgNPs and Ag+ respectively in EB culture. In comparison, in adherent culture only 43% cells survived AgNP exposure, and <2% cells survived after exposing to Ag+. These results could be explained by the fact that in adherent culture, cells formed a monolayer whereby AgNPs or Ag+ diffused freely throughout the medium, and thereby reached equilibrium where all cells were equally exposed to the same concentrations of AgNPs or Ag+. In contrast, in 3D aggregates of EBs, a concentration gradient of exogenous or endogenous factors is established between the surrounding culture environment and the interior of the spheroids [35]. Therefore, concentration of Ag+ in the interior of the EBs would be lower than that of exterior environment. The concentration is inversely related to EB size, with decreasing concentration from the surface toward the center of aggregates [35]. Due to the high cell packing density (Additional file 2: Figure S2), cells in the center of the EBs may be completely shielded and not exposed to Ag+ at all. For AgNPs, the concentration in the interior of the EBs would be ever lower than Ag+ due to more severe steric hindrance imposed on the AgNPs as a result of their larger sizes, especially if agglomeration occurred.",

Similar stimulating effects were also observed for AgNPs, albeit not statistically significant (Fig. 2a).

            "text": "The toxicity of AgNPs has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo [43]. However, whether the observed toxicity is due to Ag+ released from the AgNPs or related to the special properties of nanosized particles is not entirely clear, and is often a topic of rigorous debate. This is partly due to the fact that the release of Ag+ from AgNPs is a dynamic process and is affected by many factors such as temperature, surface chemistry, and stabilizing agent [44]. In order to unravel the mechanism of toxicity, the effect of AgNPs on the gene expression in ESCs was studied here at a relatively low toxicity concentration (~EC10) to avoid cellular processes in necrotic or apoptotic cells overwhelming and leading to misinterpretation of the data. As comparison, two concentrations of Ag+ were used, one approximates the maximum Ag+ released from 5.0 \u03bcg/ml AgNPs after 24 h incubation in the medium (1.0 \u03bcg/ml; Additional file 1: Figure S1), the other was the equivalent mass concentration of silver in 5.0 \u03bcg/ml AgNPs (i.e., 5.0 \u03bcg/ml). At 1.0 \u03bcg/ml, Ag+ only induced 47 DEGs (data not shown), compared to 101 DEGs regulated by 5.0 \u03bcg/ml AgNPs. This suggests that AgNP toxicity was not entirely due to Ag+ released from the AgNPs. In the present study, we only measured Ag+ release from AgNPs in the medium (without cells). AgNPs may also release Ag+ inside the cell via a \u201cTrojan-horse\u201d mechanism, where the particles enter cells and are then ionized within the cell [45]. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of AgNPs and Ag+ on the cellular transcriptome of ESCs, and therefore more systematic studies are needed in order to completely disentangle the effects of AgNPs from those of released Ag+. In addition, a cellular uptake study of the AgNPs may help to confirm that the transcriptomic changes seen here were indeed caused by ingested AgNPs.",

            "text": "More importantly, microarray data analysis showed that several stress response proteins, including members of the heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the metallothionein (MT) families, were upregulated by AgNPs but not Ag+. As the name suggests, HSPs are a group of proteins induced by heat shock, or hyperthermia. Their expression has also been found to increase when cells are exposed to an array of other stresses, including heavy metals and oxygen radicals [46], where they play a role in maintaining the correct folding of proteins by preventing protein aggregation or facilitating selective degradation of misfolded or denatured proteins [47]. MTs are a family of cysteine-rich proteins with several isoforms [48]. MTs have the capacity to bind heavy metals, both physiological and xenobiotic, through the thiol group of their cysteine residues [49]. It has been suggested that MTs not only are involved in the regulation of physiological metals and protect cells from metal toxicity, but also provide protection against oxidative stress [50]. The cysteines of MTs have been shown to bind oxidant radicals like superoxide and hydroxyl radicals [51], and MT expression has been implicated as a transient response to many forms of stress or injury [50]. Several previous studies [23, 24, 37, 52, 53] reported upregulation of HSPs and MTs in somatic cells following exposure to AgNPs. The upregulation of these proteins found in the current study suggests that AgNP exposure also induced cellular stresses and elicited cellular protective responses in ESCs. It was intriguing to note that the same concentration of Ag+ did not induce such stress responses in the ESCs. The reason for this is not well understood but could be partly explained by the so-called Trojan horse theory. The plasma membrane functions to some degree as a natural barrier for metal ions, thereby protecting the cells from damage. However, nanoparticles circumvent this barrier when they are taken up by the cells via endocytic pathways, leading to the release of metal ions within the cells as a result of lysosome rupture, and subsequently generate free radicals within the cells [23]. Similar findings were reported previously [23, 24].",

Cells with damaged DNA will accumulate in the G2/M phase allowing the cells extra time to repair of damaged DNA, causing arrest in cell cycle progression [23, 54]. Cells with massive or irreversible DNA damage will not be able to repair the DNA effectively and undergo apoptosis at a later stage [19, 53, 54]. The results presented here indicate that this scenario may also hold true for ESCs. Flow cytometry results (Fig. 8) indicated that both oxidative stress and apoptosis increased significantly after treatment with AgNPs. Based on these results, the molecular mechanisms of ESC cellular responses against AgNPs are therefore speculated as following (Fig. 9): AgNPs enter the cell via endocytosis, release Ag+ within the cell after lysosome rupture, and subsequently generate ROS. The increased oxidative stress further leads to DNA damage, causing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in order to repair the damaged DNA. Cells unable to repair the DNA damages will eventually undergo apoptosis.\n",

However, despite the effect of AgNPs on oxidative stress and apoptosis revealed at the protein level by flow cytometry, significant induction of genes associated with the cellular processes downstream of oxidative stress (DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis) was not observed at the mRNA level by the microarray study. This is probably because of the ephemeral nature of many gene expression changes. The correlation between mRNA and protein abundances in the cell has been reported to be notoriously poor [55]. One of the reasons for the poor correlation is that there is a temporal difference in cells responding to environment perturbations at the mRNA level and at the protein level [56]. There may have been detectable gene expression changes at the mRNA level; however, by the time when these changes are translated into the protein level, the altered mRNA expression of these genes may have already recovered to their normal level.",

On the contrary, three pathways were found in cells exposed to Ag+. The reason for this is not clear.

Overall, cellular responses to AgNPs and Ag+ in ESCs were substantially similar. In both cases, most of the functions and pathways impacted are related to embryonic development and metabolism, suggesting that both AgNPs and Ag+ have the potential to alter, reversibly or irreversibly, developmental pathways. However, specific effects on oxidative stress and apoptosis were observed for AgNPs. Taken together, our results indicate that the widespread application of AgNPs and silver-containing products may be a health concern. Long term exposure of humans to these products could potentially result in accumulation in the body and subsequently induce acute or chronic toxicity. Once systemically available, AgNPs has the potential to reach the embryo thus causing developmental toxicity. However, since information on whether these particles are able to transfer from the mother to the fetus across the placenta is currently lacking, the results of the current study have to be interpreted with caution until in vivo data becomes available.",
