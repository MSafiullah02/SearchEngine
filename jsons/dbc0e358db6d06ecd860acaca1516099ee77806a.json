            "text": "Physical activity (PA) has strong relevance for limiting the harms to human health and well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 Active muscles produce chemicals that improve immune functioning, which in turn reduces the extent of infections, and decreases inflammation, and these are the main causes of the lung damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection. PA is a powerful preventive and therapeutic intervention for the most common pre-existing chronic conditions that increase risk of severe COVID-19 infections and mortality. 2,3 PA's effectiveness in preventing and treating anxiety and depression could have worldwide benefits during this stressful global crisis. 2 PA enhances the efficacy of vaccines, 4 so active lifestyles will continue to be relevant through every phase of the pandemic. Worldwide, about 23% of men and 32% of women are at risk for the underlying conditions of COVID-19, severe COVID- 19 infections, and stress-related psychological symptoms, because they do not meet PA guidelines, based on self-report measures. 5, 6 It is likely that prolonged shelter-at-home measures lead to reduced PA and increased sedentary behaviors that adversely affect immune function and enhance risk for chronic health conditions. 7, 8 Many people, especially with low incomes, do not have equipment, internet access, or indoor space to make at-home PA realistic. Thus, the current pandemic is almost certain to exacerbate socioeconomic inequities in PA. [9] [10] [11] The pandemic is changing the places where people can be physically active because many jurisdictions closed or restricted access to common indoor and outdoor places for PA. [12] [13] [14] Though some jurisdictions allowed people to exercise outdoors on the streets, others did not, so for millions of people, being active at home was the only option. As limitations are eased, policies related to indoor and outdoor PA places vary across jurisdictions. 15, 16 If spikes occur in COVID-19 cases and deaths, movement restrictions may be put back in place. It is unknown how long this dynamic ebb and flow of limits on people's ability to be physically active will last and what the impact will be on PA. There are many unanswered questions about how pandemic-related policies in each jurisdiction are affecting PA. Therefore, it is important to identify the most pressing scientific questions that could be translated to policy and practice aimed at favorably impacting population health outcomes.",

We consider research on PA and COVID-19 to be an urgent global public health need. Within this context, relevant PA research can span a broad range from basic science covering in vitro lab studies and human studies, to clinical studies with diagnosed patients, to public health studies focusing on prevention. Among the many research needs, the present paper focuses on studies with the potential to guide public health policy and practice, with a secondary focus on studies that could guide clinical practice. Our international author team has proposed priority areas for PA and public health research relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the current literature provides strong scientific premise for the public health relevance of PA for COVID-19, 1,4,8 no research has specifically examined the impact of PA on SARS-CoV-2 infections or produced data directly related to the evaluation of infection control strategies that might impact PA. Evidence on these and other emergent topics is needed in a timely manner to inform PA policy and practice locally and internationally.",

If the patient is too ill to complete the survey, it could be completed by someone who knows the patient's PA habits. When available, PA data from the medical record could be used. Then, follow patients for their outcomes related to COVID-19, including severity of symptoms, time to recovery, hospitalization, health care utilization/costs, and mortality. A valuable add-on would be to monitor expected mediators (e.g., lung function, immune indicators, inflammatory markers, psychological health, and mental status) so mechanisms of action underlying PA and COVID-19 outcomes can be elucidated.",

For example, recent data from Garmin wearable devices was used to estimate percent change in PA across many locations during the pandemic. 36 Rationale: A prevailing notion prompting several governmental responses to the pandemic is that residential density promotes spread of infections. However, density can also be beneficial as it supports many local amenities like larger hospitals, rapid emergency responses, walkable shops and services, public transit, parks and playgrounds, and other facilities that aid health and wellness. [37] [38] [39] The problem in dense cities is crowding at a given time and place that could enhance spread of infection.

Creative use of mail-, telephone-, and online-based recruitment strategies should be harnessed during stay-at-home orders. However, some sub-groups targeted in these studies (e.g., low-income groups) are less responsive to these types of recruitment approaches, compared to in-person recruitment. 43 Social media ads, snowball sampling, and partnerships with local institutions, 43 are potential strategies to overcome this challenge. 19, 20 and/or be protective for populations with underlying medical conditions.

Though in-person data collection could be used within hospitals, it would require strong collaboration between researchers and clinicians and administrators. Out-of-hospital data collection and intervention would need to be delivered virtually. Especially in low-income areas, this would likely require the provision of electronic devices and internet access to some patients. Rationale: PA locations like trails, parks, and boardwalks became more popular after shelter-in-place orders.

Another challenge is the number and diversity of parks, playgrounds, trails, and indoor gyms and studios in each jurisdiction.

Thus, PA interventions likely need to be tailored for a variety of subgroups within each country.

A participatory co-creation approach is recommended, involving PA researchers, behavioral scientists, and community members who are on restriction, to design culturally appropriate and evidence-informed PA programs that could be delivered through e-health, print, or telephone media. Programs should include social interaction elements, as socialization is a key driver of PA for some individuals and cultures. 47 These co-created PA interventions should be implemented on a broad basis and evaluated with outcomes including participation in programs, program satisfaction, and PA.",

In LMICs, penetration of technology is not as high as in high-income countries (HICs), and the receptiveness to use technology for receiving health intervention is lower than in HICs. Access to onlinebased virtual interventions in LMICs may be limited by cost of cell phones, data plans, and internet coverage, when it is available. A practical solution may be to incorporate more conventional and feasible ways of delivering tailored interventions, such as through print media, radio, and network television.",

In-person classes are not possible. Although online PA classes have proliferated, 52 their use and effectiveness need to be evaluated before they can be considered evidence-based. Online PA behavior change programs have evidence of effectiveness. 21, 50 Therefore, there is a tremendous opportunity to evaluate diverse interventions in the context of the pandemic. We encourage researchers in each region to identify existing PA interventions that are well suited to local populations and determine whether adaptations are needed for specific target populations. Then, researchers could implement \"hybrid\" studies that simultaneously evaluate the efficacy of the interventions during the pandemic and collect data on feasibility, user satisfaction, and cost 53 that can be used to plan scaling-up the intervention if efficacy results are promising.",

Thus, there is an urgent need for research that can inform more effective PA policies and practices in the short-term and prepare global public health for better responses to future crises. The studies prioritized in this article represent several phases of the behavioral epidemiology framework, 18 which, if implemented, would document the impact of moderate-intensity PA on severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections and possibly lead to specific public health recommendations for populations to be active as well as inclusion of PA effects in statistical models used to guide policy. Most of the proposed studies would evaluate interventions of various types during the context of the current pandemic, and those results could be directly applicable to improving responses to the current and future crises.",
