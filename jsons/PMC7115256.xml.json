PMAH policy calls for a minimum of 2 samples obtained 48 hours apart for suspected MERS-CoV cases; more samples can be obtained in the event of very high suspicion, at the treating physician's discretion. However, the attending physician can override this policy if he or she deems that more testing is needed. Clearing a negative MERS-CoV case requires a minimum of 2 negative samples obtained 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization. Some patients underwent repeat testing at the discretion of the treating clinicians, and the testing was nonsystematic. MERS-CoV tests were done on either Cobon-flocked nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.",

A confirmed case was defined as a patient testing positive for the 2 genes. Early in the course of MERS-CoV, all samples were analyzed at the Riyadh regional laboratory, but starting in 2015, after a period of validation, samples were tested at the PMAH laboratory to expedite the reporting process. Obtaining the results takes 6-8 hours; usually all samples are run first thing in the morning, but samples can be run any time during the day or night depending on urgency. We included patients who had intermittently positive MERS-CoV test results after an initial negative test. We considered a case negative if 2 or more consecutive samples were negative by RT-PCR.",

We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available, because these patients were treated during the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs (Fig 1\n). The majority of samples (70%) were nasopharyngeal samples, but in critically ill and intubated patients, most samples were tracheal aspirates, with only a few sputum samples collected. A total of 1,745 tests were done for all the patients, of which 967 (55.4%) were positive, 662 (38%) were negative, and 116 (6.64%) were probable. Of the total patients, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test results, then a negative test result, followed by positive test results (Fig 2\n). Of those patients, 8 (19%) were health care workers, 17 (40.5%) were primary cases, and 10 (23%) died. All patients were symptomatic, and 72% had evidence of pneumonia on chest radiography. Seventeen patients (40.5%) did not receive steroid therapy, and 10 patients (23%) received ribavirin/interferon. Thus, it was not possible to correlate the effect of any medications with the intermittent positive samples.",

Despite the great value of molecular testing, several concerns were raised early in its application. The poor reliability of upper respiratory tract samples (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) necessitates deep sampling from the lower respiratory tract (sputum and tracheal aspirates).6, 8 Lower respiratory tract specimens, such as tracheal aspirates and sputum, have been found to be more reliable for detecting MERS-CoV including viral loads, and throat swabs are considered a useful alternative.10\n",

Specially assigned staff have been trained in nasopharyngeal sampling for MERS-CoV, and these are the only staff allowed to sample patients for MERS-CoV. Our results demonstrate the need for a minimum of 2 samples to confirm MERS-CoV, and that a third sample will increase the yield by only 1% (from 96.5% to 97.6%). Concerns about the infectivity of RT-PCR\u2013positive patients16, 17 have been confirmed by a recent report of a positive MERS-CoV culture from the upper respiratory tract of an asymptomatic positive case from KSA obtained at 15 days after illness onset.18 There is an urgent need to verify how many negative results are needed to confirm negativity. In our series, only 30% of patients had negative-positive-negative results necessitating confirmation of negativity. The KSA Ministry of Health recommends that \u201ctwo negative lower respiratory samples 24 hours apart are required for ventilated patients and one negative respiratory sample in other patients including home-isolated individuals.\u201d19 We concur with the recent WHO guideline recommending 2 MERS-CoV\u2013negative samples obtained 1 week apart to ensure clearance.20 This is particularly important because most MERS-CoV cases are linked to hospital transmission.2\n",
