A study that investigates antifibrotic effects of heparin has shown that heparin interfered with furin-like proprotein activation of platelet latent transforming growth factor \u03b21 [11] . Apart from its use as anticoagulant, unfractioned heparin and LMWHs have shown to have poteantial applications for other purposes such as allergic diseases and malignancies [12] . As we know, hyperinflammation and macrophage activating syndrome (MAS) is complicating COVID infection leading to capillary leakage and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [13, 14] . According to that, because of their anti inflammatory and antiproliferative functions; usage of unfractioned heparin, tinzaparin and dalteparin can be beneficial [15, 16] .
