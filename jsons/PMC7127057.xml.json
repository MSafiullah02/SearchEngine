The disease manifests as a fever, lasting 3\u20137 days, followed by a period of breathlessness and chest pain. Around 15% of patients affected required artificial ventilation and there was a relatively high death rate, in the order of 5%. By the third week in March, several hundred people were infected, with cases reported in Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, New Jersey, California and Bangkok (Zambon & Nicholson, 2003a).",

It also compares the way that SARS and other new infectious diseases are reported. In particular, it will compare the initial reporting of SARS with that of AIDS and Ebola.",

These are a collective coping mechanism which help people by imposing order on a seemingly chaotic and unpredictable novelty. The mass media is the major source of these representations, and both cultivates and reflects them. Social representations are best studied when \u2018new\u2019 concerns arise for different groups, for example genetic engineering or modern biotechnology (see, for example, Wagner, Kronberger, & Seifert, 2002). A social representation consists of knowledge shared by members of a community about a given subject. It is disclosed by methodical study of the \u201ccommon sense\u201d knowledge of non-specialists on the subject. \u2018Representations are embodied in communication and in individual minds, shared in a way similar to language\u2019 (Bauer & Gaskell, 1999, p.167). These representations construct the world through images, terms, descriptions, examples, models and metaphors. Thus in this paper I do not attempt to measure what \u2018the general public\u2019 or even the \u2018reading public\u2019 think in the way that a \u2018media effects\u2019 approach would. Instead, here I will focus on the media representations.",

Globalisation can mean many things: it is for many the worldwide spread of information, lifestyles, culture and technologies. But for many commentators, globalisation is primarily an economic force, implying that (nearly) all national economies are now networked with other economies around the world (Beck, 2000). One of the consequences of economic globalisation and the weakening of the nation state is greater mobility of people, both rich and poor. Another is a greater awareness of global ecological threats and the threat of global epidemics.",

The calculations the \u2018expert\u2019 provides about risk tend to be treated as if they were value-free, unbiased \u2018objective\u2019 facts (Lupton, 1999). Another model of risk is the Social Constructionist approach, which sees risk as an objective hazard, threat or danger but one that is inevitably mediated though social and cultural processes. This approach does not argue about the realities of the risk, but rather focuses on how they are politicised. Beck (1992) coined the term the Risk Society to characterise what he sees as this constant perception in late industrial or post-modern society of risk everywhere. But according to Joffe (1999), the \u2018risk society\u2019 does not necessarily leave people with a heightened state of anxiety. Rather people have defence mechanisms, namely their representations of risks, which function to control anxiety.",

Since 1973, over 20 new infectious diseases have been identified by the United States Centre for Disease control in Atlanta, including Ebola, AIDS, hepatitis C and vCJD (Satcher, 1995). SARS is just the latest to be added to this list. Some of these \u2018emerging infectious diseases\u2019 such as AIDS or Brazilian purpuric fever can be regarded as genuinely new. Others such as Hantaan viruses have been known in Asia for centuries but are now \u2018emerging\u2019 in other parts of the world. Hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola have been recognised for a relatively long time. By \u2018emerging\u2019 what is more usually meant for a Western reader is \u2018emerging from the poor\u2019, in particular the poor in the developing world. The \u2018emergence\u2019 relates to modern communication and the media \u2018Symbolically, if not epidemiologically, Ebola spread like wildfire\u2014as a danger potentially without limit.

This angle was taken as common-sense in newsrooms. In the early days of the epidemic, both in the US and the UK, the dominant representation of AIDS was that of a \u2018gay plague\u2019.Perhaps the most insidious dimension of the plague metaphor was the way in which it contributed to the normalization of an ideological dichotomy between alien, less than human \u2018others\u2019, on the one hand, and everyone else, on the other, during the initial stages of the moral panic. In the case of news reporting, the underlying imperatives of this \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019 dichotomy began to cohere as a form of prejudice from the outset. (Allen, 2002, p. 128)\n",

What he calls the mutation-contagion package is composed of the following core ideas: that microbes are on the rampage and that we are experiencing a \u2018wave of new assailants\u2019; that microbes are cleverer than us and are evolving to \u2018outwit us\u2019; that microbes and environment are conjoined in an ecological parable, and that population growth, environmental degradation and factors such as antibiotic overuse are responsible for this unfolding catastrophe; that microbes know no boundaries (through globalisation and travel); and that we are waiting for the next plague (apocalyptic prophesy). This package is clearly constructed around a frightening core with few instances of reassurance. However frightening this may be, the sense of threat is still somehow hypothetical. The diseases themselves and the likelihood that readers will be personally affected (at least for now) remain abstract and distant as the threat tends to arise in geographically distant or marginal populations. At the same time, the threats are offset by the promise of \u2018medical progress\u2019, which presents a stream of \u2018amazing new discoveries\u2019. Soon after the initial reporting however, the tone of newspaper coverage tends to shift to what Ungar (1998) calls the containment package, which aims to defuse the potential panic that emerges early in the coverage. This containment package is \u201cerected on the metaphor of \u2018otherness\u2019\u201d (Ungar, 1998, p. 49).",

Ungar (1998) uses his framework for reporting of other infectious diseases to examine the newspaper coverage of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Canadian, the US and the British newspapers. He argues that the coverage embodies many of the most terrifying aspects of the mutation-contagion package: Ebola comes from elsewhere, fits the ecological parable, and is always paired with \u2018killer\u2019 or \u2018deadly\u2019, and is almost always accompanied by descriptions of liquefying organs and profuse bleeding. What characterised the Ebola coverage was that it could be the harbinger of a wider pandemic and attendant panic. \u2018Ebola, as the embodiment of the mutation-contagion package, represents a monster virus on a potential rampage\u2019 (Ungar, 1998, p. 47).",

The \u2018appalling sanitary conditions\u2019 of many African hospitals are contrasted with the exemplary protective methods of the Western experts. A few days later, there is a further shift in the tone of the newspaper coverage, as attention is given to Western health teams, who, as opposed to the chaos in Zaire, are \u2018disease detectives\u2019. By now Ebola is treated not as a rampaging virus, but as a disease that is difficult to catch. In particular, the \u2018stepping off a plane scenario\u2019 (where a person can travel across the world whilst carrying the infection) is undermined, often in the very newspapers who days before espoused it, as journalists begin to report that people with Ebola are not infectious until ill, and then unlikely to be allowed to catch a plane.",

Beyond this, other factors implicated in the spread of Ebola are poverty, pollution, forest environment and tribal rituals. By symbolising Ebola as essential to Africa as a whole, it implies that such disasters are \u2018incontrovertibly African\u2019 (disaster ridden), and by implication that the West is superior. In terms of whether Ebola is a threat, the newspapers evoke fear by highlighting how terrifying and horrific it is (providing vivid descriptions of liquefying bodies); and by comparisons with AIDS. Alongside the fear theme, the articles are pervaded by an emphasis on how Ebola can be brought under control by isolation, quarantine and surveillance (by Westerners), at the same time rarely alluding to the role played by Africans, who are portrayed as passive and voiceless. The way that reassurance is provided is through the notion that Africa and the Africans are so different to \u2018us\u2019 (so \u2018other\u2019) that the disease will be contained, and will in reality provide nothing more that a hypothetical threat.The strategy of othering is a direct counterpoint to the theme of globalisation\u2026 Whereas globalisation is predicated on a levelling of nations and individuals, othering aims to reverse the rites of inclusion and protect the social order by erecting barriers of exclusion.

Orientalism is a collective notion identifying \u201cus\u201d Europeans against \u201cthose\u201d non-Europeans, and advocating that European identity is superior to all the non-European peoples and cultures.

Again Chinese conditions were blamed squarely for the emergence of this virus which was assumed to have jumped species because of Chinese hygiene, fondness for exotic foods and farming methods. The following is a typical example (from a broadsheet, The Sunday Times):Just a six miles north of the city lies old China, which has yet to be sanitised by steel and concrete. The main market for live animals is like a scene from a virologist's nightmare: slaughtered carcasses of dogs, pigs and cows are steamed and skinned by teams of bare-handed workers.Blood, skin and offal are stamped into the mud, mingling with the droppings of ducks and chickens confined by the thousand in cages.

Teeming Asia or the Heart of Darkness\u2014take your pick of which most frightens you.This fear of epidemics and pandemics is interesting.

According to Joffe (1999), the motivation is primarily to do with identity protection, which refers simultaneously to the protection of the in-group and self-identity (and to building its cohesion by negatively distinguishing the \u2018other\u2019 from it). Anchors are devices that the group finds comfortable, familiar and acceptable. At the same time, the chosen representation maintains the status of certain groups in society.",

            "text": "In making a comparison of the SARS coverage with that of Ebola, what is also worth noting is what themes featured in the coverage of Ebola but not in the case of SARS. There were very few graphic descriptions of the disease, as there had been with Ebola; and there only a handful of occurrences (n<5) throughout the whole 4 weeks newspaper sample of any of the following codes: poverty, population growth, environmental degradation; marginal populations, difficult to catch; geographically distant. The depictions of locals as passive, that had been a feature of the Ebola coverage also received no mention in the SARS coverage. However, this is because the only mention of the (mainland) Chinese themselves in the newspapers is to describe their officials as corrupt, secretive, incompetent, chaotic or mendacious. The Chinese people themselves are not depicted as passive (as were the Africans in the Ebola reporting), but they are invisible: for example, Dr. Urbani became for the newspapers the first person to identify SARS, rather than the first WHO official. Yet the newspaper allegations of a Chinese cover-up reveal that Chinese doctors were aware of this new disease before Dr. Urbani reported it. The Chinese themselves are rarely quoted and their opinions rarely sought. The only time they are depicted is when vivid descriptions of the filth, sputum, live animals for food and so on which are clearly meant to invoke disgust at the way \u2018they\u2019 live. Interestingly, Hong Kong, which has only recently ceased to be a British colony, is regarded as Western from the point of view of the UK newspapers; it is only the mainland Chinese authorities and people that are treated as \u2018other\u2019.",

The final difference between the SARS and Ebola coverage is that in the SARS case there are individuals who are targeted for blame: the \u2018patient zeros\u2019. Two people in particular are mentioned: one is the Professor in Hong Kong, and the other the index patient in Hanoi, who was the source of the cluster that alerted and ultimately killed Dr. Urbani.",

In particular, the way the readers\u2019 fears are aroused and then almost simultaneously dampened through \u2018othering\u2019. The descriptions of the effect on daily life, particularly in Hong Kong: the deserted shopping malls, cinemas and restaurants; empty public transport; events where crowds would gather cancelled; the surgical face masks; all evoke either zombie or post-apocalypse horror-film imagery. Yet at the same time, we are told that \u2018it couldn\u2019t happen here\u2019 because the Chinese are so different to \u2018us\u2019. As Africa and Africans were portrayed as disaster ridden in the case of Ebola, so China and the Chinese are portrayed as an inevitable breeding ground for new infections. Whether it be African local customs in the case of Ebola or Chinese ones with SARS, all confirm the African/Chinese as \u2018other\u2019 (and by implication inferior to \u2018us\u2019).

On 14 July, the WHO stopped publishing a daily table of the cumulative number of reported probable cases of SARS (WHO, 2003b) (although there may of course be a recurrence of SARS in the future). SARS undoubtedly presented a serious risk to human health in the realist sense, insofar as it was contagious to people in very close contact to an affected person (family members and health care staff in particular), but very much less infectious to people in ordinary social contact with someone with the illness. It was an illness which killed around 5% of those affected, but mostly those with other underlying health problems, but which was very much less dangerous to those in the West who were well-nourished and in otherwise good health.",

These successes are in part due to vaccination programmes, leading to the global eradication of smallpox, and dramatic reductions in the Western world in the incidence of, for example, diphtheria, polio, measles, whooping cough and mumps. Biomedicine has also produced major advances in drug therapy such as antibiotics leading to dramatic reductions in incidence of tuberculosis or syphilis for example (although incidence of both diseases is beginning to rise again in the West). Until the 1970s, there was a widespread notion within and outside of the medical profession that biomedicine could one day \u2018conquer\u2019 infectious disease. SARS is the latest in a growing list of newly emerging infectious diseases that have been reported over the last 30 or so years. In the light of the phenomenon of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, very few people still share that optimism.",
