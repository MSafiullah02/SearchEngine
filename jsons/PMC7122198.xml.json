More recent studies use large meta-analyses and scaling to control for spurious associations such as heavier drinkers also being heavier smokers. The data presented in Table 3.1 (Hashibe et al. 2009) are typical of these studies (see also Ansary-Moghaddam et al. 2009) pooling over 11,000 cases and 16,000 controls to evaluate alcohol\u2013tobacco interactive effects on UADT cancers. Note that \u201calcohol alone\u201d failed to increase the odds ratio (OD) for any of the subsites or for UADT cancers as a whole. By contrast, there is a consistent synergistic effect between smoking and drinking for each of the three cancers included in the study. Using the combined data for \u201cHead and neck cancer overall\u201d as an example, in the presence of tobacco use the added effect of alcohol increased the odds ratio (OR) from 2.37 to 5.73, which indicates a tripling the number of added cancer cases (from a 137% increase over baseline to a 473% increase over baseline). The statistical significance term \u03c8  >  1 indicates a joint effect greater than expected under a multiplicative model (Hashibe et al. 2009).\n",

Alcohol consumption, including the category with an intake of \u22657 units/week exhibited no impact on rates for UADT cancers if the women were \u201cnever smokers\u201d. If, however, women were current smokers then even the lowest intake category (\u22642 units/week) exhibited increased risk (RR  =  2.54) for UADT cancers. And women smokers consuming 3\u20136 units/week had a 3.57-fold increase in UADT cancers compared to nonsmokers. Since each unit  =  10 g of ethanol, this means that intake less that 20 g/week, that is 1  \u00bd drinks per week (where one drink equals 14 g of ethanol, NIAAA 2007) is sufficient to more than double the risk for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. This magnitude of sensitization caused by smoking raises the question whether consumption of alcohol in a range otherwise deemed safe may in fact carry a significant risk if a sensitizing cofactor is also present.\n",

Table 3.3 summarizes the main results of three studies (Donato et al. 2002; Hassan et al. 2002; Yuan et al. 2004). Relatively high alcohol consumption (greater than 4 drinks per day) increased the odds ratios (ORs) to 2.6, 7.0, or 8.0 in the three studies in the absence of viral hepatitis. But a remarkably greater effect occurs when alcohol acts in concert with HBV or HCV, yielding odds ratios for HCC 48, 54, and 109-fold above baseline, respectively. This observation illustrates that the synergistic impact of alcohol on HCC can far outweigh its independent effects (i.e., effects occurring in the absence of other risk factors). Moreover, the combination of alcoholic liver disease and HCV occurs in a significant portion of patients with liver disease (Singal and Anand 2007), which suggests a frequently underestimated contribution to HCC (Mueller et al. 2009).\n",

Other studies found that while smoking alone increased the ORs for HCC (3.9 for men and 3.1 in women), a significant interaction with alcohol was only observed in women (OR  =  2.8 for men and 13.7 for women; Hassan et al. 2008).",

Since one unit is 10 g of ethanol, this is equivalent to ten drinks per week (or less that 1  \u00bd per day) based on NIAAA definition of 14 g per drink (NIAAA 2007). And for intake greater than 14 units (ten drinks) per week, the RRs were 3.16 in normal weight, 7.01 in overweight, and 18.9 in obese men (Fig. 3.3, data from Hart et al. 2010). Thus, these data demonstrate the capacity for obesity to amplify the effects of alcohol on HCC and to sensitize pathophysiologic mechanisms at rates of alcohol consumption usually considered safe.",

For example, male mice and ovariectomized female mice are more sensitive to diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC than are intact females, and estradiol treatment reinstates resistance to DEN in ovariectomized females (Shimizu et al. 1998; Maeda et al. 2005).",

A typical estimate is 7.1  \u00b1  1.3% for each unit per day (Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer 2002; see also Key et al. 2006). An increased relative risk of 7% per unit (or 10% per 14 g drink) may appear modest compared to values cited above, but breast cancer occurs very frequently and many women drink moderately.

However, reviews of this literature include both positive and negative studies (Seitz and Cho 2009). Examples of positive studies include the large NHANES follow-up study (NHEFS) that found the RR for colon cancer was 1.69 (Su and Arab 2004), and a pooled analysis of eight cohort studies indicated a RR  =  1.41 for subjects drinking more than 45 g/day (Cho et al. 2004), but with no indication of gender differences or specific beverage effects. Finally, two recent reports came to different conclusions. While a large pros\u00adpective study in Europe concluded that alcohol consumption was not associated with CRC (Park et al. 2009), a large meta-analysis of 103 cohort studies concluded the pooled RR for alcohol-associated CRC was 1.56 (1.42\u20131.79), which was about twice that of other significant lifestyle factors including, diabetes, consumption of red meat, obesity, or smoking (Huxley et al. 2009). Finally, it has been suggested that additional confounding effects for CRC may be associated with diet (Larsson et al. 2005) or the microbiome resident in the GI tract (Seitz and Cho 2009; Koivisto and Salaspuro 1998). It is anticipated that an understanding of these additional factors may help resolve apparent discrepancies in the existing literature.",

The second is the emerging evidence indicating a genetic susceptibility to lung cancer associated with the alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolizing enzymes already associated with UADT cancers (Segado Soriano et al. 2005; Minegishi et al. 2007; Park et al. 2010).",

            "text": "Recent US data indicate that thyroid cancer is diagnosed in about 22,000 individuals each year with a relative low mortality rate of about 1,600 (ACS Table, 2009). Thyroid cancer is unusual in several ways: First, it is one of the few cancers with a significantly higher incidence rate (2.7-fold) in women than in men (i.e., other than breast and female reproductive system cancers, ACS Table, 2009). Second, very few risk factors have been identified for thyroid cancer, and those that have been identified are uncharacteristic of other cancers (iodine deficiency and childhood exposure to ionizing radiation, Dal Maso et al. 2009). Finally, the risk for thyroid cancer is decreased with alcohol consumption especially in women (Nagano et al. 2007; Mack et al. 2003). In the Million Women Study, alcohol reduced the incidence of thyroid cancer by nearly 50% (RR  =  0.54, p  <  0.005; Allen et al. 2009). The National Cancer Institute\u2019s NIH-AARP study confirmed a protective effect due to alcohol (RR  =  0.57, p  <  0.01) with two or more drinks per day and also indicated that beer was more effective than wine or distilled spirits (Meinhold et al. 2009). Finally, thyroid cancer may not be unique, since several sources including the Million Women Study also found decreased incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR  =  0.77, p  =  0.001) and renal cell carcinoma (RR  =  0.66, p  =  0.03) associated with alcohol consumption.",

Note that the AAF data approximate those in Table 3.1 (Hashibe et al. 2009), which explicitly takes into account tobacco\u2013alcohol interactions on UADT cancers. The fifth and sixth columns of Table 3.4 are calculated for males and females, which are then summed and compared to the ARDI data cited in the Introduction. The total alcohol-attributable cancer deaths per year are calculated to be 16,433, which is much greater than the number (2,464) provided in the ARDI report (CDC 2010) and does not include prostate cancer or \u201cother neoplasms\u201d for which there were missing data cells.
