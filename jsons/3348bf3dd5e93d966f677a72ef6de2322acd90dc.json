A recent systematic review revealed how early tracheostomy, performed in the first 7 days after orotracheal intubation, is associated with a reduction of mechanical ventilation duration, mortality rate and length of stay in ICU [4] . Despite surgical tracheostomies being routinely performed in the surgeon's daily practice, the surgeon's risk of exposure to COVID-19 during this procedure is consistent. Due to the direct access to the airway and the mechanical ventilation, which generates a huge amount of droplets in case of air-leakage from the cuff, tracheostomies place surgeons to be the highest risk category, together with ICU nurses and doctors. Surgical tracheostomy on sedated and intubated patient is, by far, preferable than awake patient tracheostomy or percutaneous cricothyrotomy for which air-flow cessation cannot be obtained and droplets emission is inevitably higher.",

At this stage ventilation is stopped entirely, the tracheal tube is lifted, without extubating the patient, until its bottom side passes the tracheal window, then cannula is inserted in the tracheal lumen. Promptly, the cannula cuff is inflated at the appropriate pressure level and a non-fenestrated inner tube along with the heat and moisture exchanger is positioned: only then the ventilation is resumed by close airway circuit attachment. Tracheal cannula should be considered correctly positioned until CO 2 value is displayed, avoiding stethoscope contamination by thoracic auscultation. Only at this point endotracheal tube is completely removed together with the sterile drape covering the face and tracheal cannula is secured to the neck with sutures and staples. Dressing should be performed so that no cannula change would be required for 7 days. Even PPE doffing is a crucial moment which should be carried out in a separate area, even then with \"buddy check\". OR should be decontaminated according to the local guidelines.",
