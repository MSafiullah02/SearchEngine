            "text": "The genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae consists of four approved species: Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 2 (BVDV-2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Border disease virus (BDV); and a tentative species Pestivirus of giraffe (Thiel et al., 2005). BVDV infections are usually very mild or inapparent clinically (Baker, 1987), but severe hemorrhagic syndrome is also observed in acute infection (Perdrizet et al., 1987, Corapi et al., 1989, Ridpath et al., 2006). Diaplacental infection can lead to birth of persistently infected animals that serve as a reservoir for further spreading of the virus (Sandvik, 2005). BVD is considered as one of the major diseases with a worldwide economic impact in the cattle industry. For example, the cost of BVDV infection has been estimated about $25 per cow in dairy herd in New Zealand (Reichel et al., 2008), and may exceed $400 per cow when infected with a high virulent strain or co-infected with other pathogens (Pritchard et al., 1989, Carman et al., 1998, Houe, 2003). Sweden is one of the first countries to implement national BVDV-eradication programme since 1993 (Lindberg and Alenius, 1999), and now the country is almost free of BVDV (St\u00e5hl et al., 2005, Lindberg et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Serological tests, including virus neutralization and ELISA, have been used widely for detection of BVDV antibodies. The recent advance in microsphere-based flow cytometric technology has provided the possibility to develop multiplex diagnostic assays on a single platform. These assays can be designed more sensitive than conventional immunoassays due to the uses of small beads (5 \u03bcm) that leads to better reaction kinetics approaching liquid-phase conditions, and of chromophore phycoerythrin, an exceptionally bright reporter dye (Krishhan et al., 2009). The microspheres used in Luminex xMAP technology (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) are coded with unique combinations of fluorescent dyes, and can be immobilized with capture molecules, e.g. antibody. Immunoassays can be developed in a similar way as ELISA, but signals are detected and processed by Luminex analyzer. By using xMAP technology, a range of diagnostic assays has been developed in the recent years for the improved serological detection of viruses, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus that causes maladies (Jones et al., 2002), human immunodeficiency virus (Faucher et al., 2004), human papillomaviruses (Dias et al., 2005), equine arteritis virus (Go et al., 2008), and avian influenza virus (Watson et al., 2009). The objectives of this study were to develop a blocking microsphere-based immunoassay (bMIA) for detection of antibodies against BVDV, and to compare the performance of the assay with a commercial ELISA kit.",

As shown in Fig. 1\n, both WB112 and WB103 had a very low MFI value when 1 \u03bcg of mAb was used in coupling reaction. At 4 \u03bcg/ml of PE-IgG, 5 \u03bcg of WB112 gave an MFI value of 5000, whereas WB103 gave an MFI value of 14 000. This indicated that, for the same amount of mAb, WB103 had a higher coupling efficiency than WB112. Further increasing WB103 from 5 \u03bcg to 25 \u03bcg had less effect on the MFI values. Therefore, WB103 (10 \u03bcg) was selected finally as the capture antibody for coupling to microspheres, and WB112 was used as detection antibody in this study.",

The diagnostic performance of the new bMIA was compared to that of a commercial blocking ELISA system, by testing a large panel of 509 bovine sera. In general, the two assays worked consistently for detection of BVDV antibodies in 502 samples. Six samples were positive in bMIA but negative in ELISA. These samples had a percentage of inhibition value between 5% and 42% in blocking ELISA. One reason for this discrepancy could be that these sera blocked binding of the viral antigen to the detection antibody in the bMIA, leading to false-positive results. But more likely it was due to a slight higher sensitivity of the MIA than ELISA. Only one sample was negative by the bMIA but positive by ELISA with a percentage of inhibition value of 47.5% (just above the cut-off value of 45%). The observed discrepancies are in line with another comparison of ELISA with a Luminex assay for detection of human papillomavirus 16: six out of 215 samples reacted differently in the two assays (Faust et al., in press).",

It would be very interesting to detect antibodies, when available, against novel pestiviruses Th/04_KhonKaen (Liu et al., 2009a) and SVA/cont-08 (Liu et al., 2009b), which have been proposed as a new species BVDV-3 (Liu et al., 2009c). Another direction would be to extend the assay for detection of antibodies against other viruses, e.g. bovine herpesvirus type 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza-3 virus, thus allowing a robust diagnosis of bovine respiratory diseases in a multiplex format. The power of a Luminex assay lies in its multiplex capacity. Khan et al. (2006) reported a multiplex microbead immunoassay for simultaneous detection of antibodies against six nonhuman-primate viruses. Multiplexing can bring down the high cost of the bMIA dramatically by reducing the number of ELISA kit for each pathogen, labour input and hands-on time. This will, in turn increase the applicability of the assay.",
