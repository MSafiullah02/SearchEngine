Most of the currently used antiviral vaccines are based on homologous inactivated or attenuated viral particles. However, reversion of an attenuated live vector to a virulent strain by genetic recombination cannot be excluded, precluding the use of this strategy for many pathogens.6 Virus-like particles (VLPs) represent a specific class of subunit vaccine that mimics the structure of authentic virus particles. VLPs are safer than inactivated or attenuated viral particles and are more likely to stimulate stronger immune responses than single protein-based vaccines.7 Systems for constructing VLPs have been well explored in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rotavirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human papillomavirus (HPV).8\u201314 Currently, VLPs as an antigen presenting and delivery system are under investigation in preclinical studies or clinical trials against different human viruses. For example, an effective HPV VLP vaccine was developed and has been used in clinical trials.15\u201317",

To date, intranasal (i.n.) immunization is emerging as possibly the most effective route for vaccination. Because the transmission route of SARS-CoV is through the mucosal membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth,2 a vaccine to achieve mucosal immunity should be considered as the primary goal for SARS vaccine development. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV VLPs when administered through the mucosal route. Our data demonstrate that intraperitoneal (i.p.) and i.n. immunization with VLPs, with or without a cytosine\u2013phosphate\u2013guanosine (CpG) adjuvant, elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice.",

A final volume of 30 \u03bcl of the heat-inactivated diluted serum was mixed with 10 ng of pseudoviruses suspended in 30 \u03bcl of Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium, and incubated at 37\u00b0 for 1 hr. After incubation, 40 \u03bcl of medium containing 16 ng of polybrene was added to 96-well microtitre plates. Following 3 hr of incubation at 37\u00b0, serum/virus mixtures were replaced with cell culture medium. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 in the presence of 5% CO2 for 2 days, and the infection was monitored by measuring luciferase activity, expressed from the reporter gene carried by the pseudovirus, using a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The neutralizing antibody titre was defined as the highest dilution of tested samples that reduced virus infectivity by 50% compared with negative control samples.",

Our results indicate that VLPs administered via i.p. or i.n. routes induced specific serum IgG, although the antibody titre was lower in the i.n. immunization group (Fig 1), while CpG had little effect in terms of enhancing the IgG response. Additionally, sIgA was detected in mucosal secretions and tissues. A detectable sIgA response existed in genital tract washes and in faeces samples from animals in the i.p. groups immunized with VLPs plus 10 \u03bcg of CpG adjuvant. Mucosal immunity is mainly mediated by sIgA and has been shown to be effectively induced by i.n. immunization. CpGs are potent systemic and mucosal adjuvants in mice and were shown to be potent adjuvants for antigens delivered intranasally. 33\u201335 Interestingly, we found that CpG induced lower IgA production compared with antigen alone in the genital tract after immunization via the i.p. route.

We observed relatively high titres of neutralizing antibody activity in sera from mice immunized via the i.n.- and i.p. routes and in genital tract washes from the i.n. group. Surprisingly, the serum neutralization antibody induced by VLPs alone from the i.n. group was five times higher than that in the i.p. group, and 25 times higher when CpG adjuvant was used, suggesting that different delivery routes play an important role in antigen uptake. Of interest, we observed higher neutralizing titres in the presence of CpGs, while the titres obtained following ELISA were similar in the presence or absence of CpGs. The detection methodology may account for such differences. ELISA was performed by coating the plates with inactivated SARS-CoV as capture antigen, while HIV-based pseudoviruses were used in the neutralization assay. Therefore, ELISA detected the total antibodies induced by VLPs, whereas only the specific S antibody contributed to the neutralization activity.",

IFN-\u03b3, a marker for Th1 responses, and IL-4, a marker for T helper type 2 (Th2) responses, were determined using the ELISPOT assay. Our results showed that SARS-CoV VLPs induced a Th1-based cellular immune response in mice immunized intraperitoneally but not in mice immunized intranasally (data not shown). The weak cellular immune responses induced through the i.n. route in the current study are in agreement with the report by Bessa et al. that intranasal immunization with Q\u03b2-VLP stimulated a poor cytotoxic T-cell response",

However, the effects in mice may be more dramatic than those in humans and the way in which the antigen is taken up may be different as a result of the nature of the antigen. Before the development of VLPs as an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV in humans, it needs to be addressed whether the i.n. immunization in mice corresponds to the i.n. immunization in humans.",
