The central domain of the nucleocapsid protein contains several arginine \u2044 serine (RS) dipeptides, the biological significance of which has not been well investigated. In the present study, we demonstrate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is phosphorylated primarily within the RS-rich region in cells and by SR protein kinase 1 in vitro. The nucleocapsid protein could suppress translation and its RS motif is essential for such an activity. Moreover, phosphorylation of the RS motif could modulate the translation inhibitory activity of the nucleocapsid protein.",

We observed that the nucleocapsid protein could translocate to cytoplasmic stress granules in response to cellular stress. Deletion or mutations of the RS motif enhanced stress granule localization of the nucleocapsid protein, whereas overexpression of SR protein kinase 1 inhibited nucleocapsid protein localization to stress granules. The nucleocapsid protein lacking the RS motif formed high-order RNP complexes, which may also account for its enhanced stress granule localization. Taken together, phosphorylation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV nucleocapsid protein modulates its activity in translation control and also interferes with its oligomerization and aggregation in stress granules. and packaging of viral genomic RNA [8] [9] [10] . Moreover, it binds to the 5\u00a2 and \u2044 or 3\u00a2 end of the genomic RNA [11] [12] [13] and may participate in viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription [14, 15] . However, other evidence suggests that the N protein is dispensable for these processes [16] . In addition, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) N protein stimulates translation of a reporter mRNA containing an intact MHV 5\u00a2-untranslated region, probably by binding to a tandem repeat of UCYAA in the leader sequence [17] . By contrast, recent evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV N protein interferes with translation through its interaction with cellular translation elongation factor 1a [18] . In addition, the SARS-CoV N protein can inhibit the activity of cellular cyclin-dependent kinases and thereby perturb S phase progression of virusinfected cells [19, 20] . Therefore, coronavirus N proteins may affect various cellular functions.",

The N-terminal domain interacts with RNA through a structural module rich in positively charged residues [22] [23] [24] . The RNA binding capacity of the N protein is critical for viral infectivity [24] . The C-terminal domain folds into a b-sheet platform engaged in homodimerization [24, 25] and may also confer the RNA binding activity [10] .

Nucleolar localization of N protein requires regions in the protein that are rich in arginine residues and is likely cell cycle-dependent [20, 35, 36] . The avian infectious bronchitis virus N protein indeed interacts with and colocalizes with the nucleolar proteins nucleolin and fibrillarin [38, 39] . However, the ability of nucleolar localization varies between N proteins of different coronaviruses [36] . The SARS-CoV N protein is poorly localized to the nucleolus [36] . In the present study, we found that the SARS-CoV N protein appeared in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). When eukaryotic cells encounter environmental stress, mRNA metabolism is reprogrammed to adapt to stress-induced damage. Translationally stalled mRNAs together with a number of translation initiation factors and RNA-binding proteins are deposited into SGs [40] . Formation of SGs can also be induced by overexpression of the prion-like RNA binding protein TIA-1 [41] . Upon stress induction, TIA-1 forms aggregates in SGs and may play a role in translation inhibition [41] .",

The N protein of all coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV, contains an RS-rich motif ( Fig. 1 ) that likely provides potential phosphorylation sites for multiple cellular kinases [32] . We predicted that N proteins, due to their similarity with cellular SR proteins in the RS-rich motif, may serve as a substrate of SR protein specific kinases. To study phosphorylation of SARS-CoV N protein RS domain, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged N protein and the RS-deleted mutant (NDRS) in HEK293 cells. Transfected cells were incubated with [ 32 P]orthophosphate for labeling. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation of the full-length N protein from the cell lysate revealed a 32 P-labeled band at approximately 52 kDa ( Fig. 2A, lane 1) , similar to previous reports [42] , indicating that the SARS-CoV N protein was phosphorylated in vivo. However, inefficient labeling of NDRS ( Fig. 2A, lane 2) suggested that the RS motif is the major phosphorylation site for the SARS-CoV N protein in cells. We next examined whether the SR protein kinase SRPK1 can phosphorylate the N protein within its RS-rich motif. Full-length N and NDRS were each fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation using purified SRPK1. Figure 2B shows that only full-length N protein was phosphorylated by SRPK1. However, neither another SR protein kinase, Clk1, nor protein kinase A was able to phosphorylate the N protein in vitro (see supplementary Fig. S1 ). To avoid the possibility that inefficient phosphorylation of NDRS resulted from its improper folding, recombinant GST-NDRS protein was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum of purified NDRS suggested that this truncated protein still adopted an ordered conformation ( Fig. 2C ) and was also similar to that of the full-length N protein (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the RS-rich region of the SARS-CoV N protein is possibly phosphorylated by SRPK1.",

Both the protein level and activity of the luciferase were measured, which may directly reflect the translation activity because luciferase mRNA levels were similar between treatments ( Fig. 3 , bottom). The GST-N protein suppressed luciferase translation in a dose-dependent manner but this translation suppressive effect was attenuated upon phosphorylation by SRPK1 (Fig. 3 ).

Moreover, His-N appeared to form oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B,C) . The phosphorylated N protein also bound this RNA probe and its dissociation constant was determined to be 66.7 nm, which was similar to that of nonphosphorylated N protein (Fig. 4C) . However, formation of high-order N protein RNP complexes appeared to be impaired when the N protein was phosphorylated (Fig. 4D) .

This granule-like localization pattern was also observed with the full-length N protein, albeit rarely (approximately 1% of the transfected cells). Although this granule staining pattern was observed only in a few percent of N or NDRSprotein expressing cells under normal cell conditions, it was greatly enhanced upon arsenite treatment (> 95% transfected cells; Fig. 5B ).

            "text": "To distinguish whether the RS motif deletion or a lack of phosphorylation enhanced N protein localization in SGs, we examined the cellular localization of two RS motif mutants, N-6A and N-14A. Both mutants showed a higher tendency towards SG localization than the wild-type N (Fig. 5A) , suggesting that SG localization of the N protein primarily resulted from its hypophosphorylation. Moreover, the N-terminal (N NT ) but not the C-terminal (N CT ) part of the N protein appeared to be responsible for granule localization (Fig. 5A) . We apparently reasoned that the N-terminal domain contains the RS motif and confers RNA binding ability [10, 22] and is therefore capable of forming granules. Next, we evaluated SRPK1-mediated RS motif phosphorylation in modulating SG localization or retention of the N protein. FLAG-tagged N protein and HA-tagged SRPK1 were transiently coexpressed in HeLa cells. In the presence of overexpressed SRPK1, the N protein was unable to localize to SGs, even after arsenite treatment of the cells (Fig. 6 , white arrows). However, SRPK1 overexpression could not disperse RS deletion or alanine substitution mutants to the cytoplasm (NDRS and N-14A; Fig. 6 ). Under this condition, PABP1, similar to NDRS and N-14A, showed a granular pattern (Fig. 6, lower panel) , indicating that SG assembly is not disturbed by overexpression of SRPK1. Therefore, phosphorylation of the RS motif might diminish N protein oligomerization (Fig. 4) and thereby prevent its aggregation in SGs. Together, the SARS-CoV N protein could target to SGs, reflecting its role in translation suppression. Moreover, phosphorylation of the RS motif modulates the ability of the N protein to form SGs.",

Using glycerol gradient sedimentation, we observed that the N protein formed RNPs in cells because it was moved to lighter density fractions after RNase treatment (Fig. 7A ). Compared to full-length N, NDRS even migrated in heavier fractions of the sucrose density gradient (Fig. 7B) . The high-order NDRS complexes were also sensitive to RNase (data not shown). Therefore, removal of the RS motif from the N protein induced larger RNP formation, which may account for NDRS aggregation in SGs.

            "text": "The RS domain is a characteristic feature of cellular pre-mRNA splicing factors [27, 29] . Several viral proteins also contain various numbers of repeated RS dipeptides. The transactivator E2 protein of cutaneous papillomaviruses has a relatively long RS domain, which functions to recruit cellular splicing factors for cotranscriptional splicing regulation [47] . The core protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has an arginine-rich domain at the C-terminus that bears a few RS dipeptides. The HBV core protein can be phosphorylated by SRPK1 and SRPK2 [48] . Similar to the HBV core, coronavirus N proteins contain a short RS-rich motif (Fig. 1 ) and the SARS-CoV N protein might be phosphorylated by SRPK1 (Fig. 2) . We have examined whether the SARS-CoV N protein plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing due to the presence of the RS motif but, so far, we do not have any evidence to support this hypothesis (data not shown). In the present study, we provide evidence that the SARS-CoV N protein could suppress translation at least in vitro (Fig. 3) . The potential role of the N protein in translation control might correlate with its localization in the cytoplasmic SGs (Fig. 5 ) and is also in line with recent reports that coronavirus infection could cause translational shut-off in host cells and that the SARS-CoV N protein may execute this activity via its interact with elongation factor 1a [18, 44] . Although coronaviral N protein largely forms helical nucleocapsids with the viral RNA genome during infection [10] , how it participates in translation control in host cells and whether it has any substrate specificity or functions under certain cellular conditions remain to be studied in the future. Previous reports have suggested that the SARS-CoV N protein can act as a substrate of various kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases, glycogen synthase kinase, creatine kinase II and mitogen-activated protein kinase [32] . Our data show that multiple serine residues within the RS motif could be in vitro phosphorylated by SRPK1 (Fig. 2) . The SARS-CoV N protein is primarily distributed in the cytoplasm, coincident with the cellular localization of SRPK1. Coexpression of SRPK1 could modulate cellular localization of the N protein, suggesting that the N protein is a substrate of SRPK1 in cells (Fig. 6) . Phosphorylation of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus N protein also occurs on a moderately conserved serine within the RS motif, although which kinases could phosphorylate this serine is as yet unknown [33] . In the present study, we provide evidence that SRPK1-mediated RS motif phosphorylation influences the biochemical and biological activities of the SARS-CoV N protein. First, the potential translation suppression activity of the SARS-CoV N protein might be modulated by phosphorylation (Fig. 3) . Moreover, phosphorylation may also impact on its oligomerization, cellular localization and perhaps RNP complex formation (Figs 4-7) . The questions of whether SRPK1 phosphorylates the SARS-CoV N protein in cells particularly during viral infection and where this phosphorylation occurs remain to be answered.",

However, other evidence indicated that the RS motif interferes with SARS-CoV N protein multimerization but this activity requires its C-terminal domain [26] . Our data show that RS motif phosphorylation partially impaired N protein multimerization (Fig. 4) . Perhaps such phosphorylation modulates the balance between N protein self-association and dissociation, which thereby impacts on its cellular functions. Multimerization of the N protein is necessary for nucleocapsid formation and assembly of the viral particles [42] . Thus, whether phosphorylation of the RS motif in virions could modulate N protein function in encapsulation of genomic RNA remains to be investigated. Moreover, we observed that deletion of the RS motif greatly enhanced association of the SARS-CoV N protein with cellular RNPs (Fig. 7) . Perhaps RS motif phosphorylation prevents nonspecific binding of the N protein to cellular RNP complexes and thus aids viral genome packaging into capsids; this possibility also remains to be tested.",

            "text": "During infection, coronaviral N protein participates in virus replication that probably occurs at the sites associated with ER-derived membrane tubules and vesicles [49] . Subsequently, viral nucleocapsids are transported to the budding sites in the Golgi region for viral particle formation. Although overexpressed, most coronavirus N proteins are located in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleolus [34, 35] . Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV N protein does not localize substantially to the nucleolus [36, 50] , as also observed in the present study (Fig. 5 ). It has been proposed that the signals for nuclear and nucleolar targeting of the SARS-CoV N protein are poorly accessible to the nuclear import machinery due to phosphorylation regulation or conformational constrains [36, 50] . Nevertheless, the present study has revealed for the first time that overexpressed SARS-CoV N protein might localize to SGs in HeLa cells (Fig. 5) . Such an SG localization pattern was enhanced by deletion or phosphorylation site mutations of the RS motif and was obvious in stress-treated cells (Fig. 5) . SGs contain mRNPs whose translation is temporarily blocked [40] . Therefore, the N protein may sequester cellular mRNPs in SGs and inhibit their translation, possibly during viral infection. Nevertheless, the evidence demonstrating that RS motif phosphorylation reduced oligomerization of the N protein and prevented its aggregation in SGs is likely to be in accordance with the attenuation of its translation suppression activity.",

We generated the NDRS cDNA by ligating the PCR fragments encoding amino acid residues 1-175 and 215-422, respectively. The full-length N and NDRS cDNAs were each cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in-frame with the FLAG-epitope tag, and also into pCEP4 (Invitrogen) to generate the HA-tagged proteins. All the N protein mutants were generated from the FLAG-N construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA); the sequences of these mutants were verified. The cDNAs encoding the N-terminal (residues 1-214) and C-terminal (residues 215-422) domain of the N protein and N-6A and N-14A were individually cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) in-frame fusion with the pre-engineered FLAG-tag. The pET11D-His-N vector was obtained from T. H. Huang (Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica) and used for production of the Histagged full-length N protein in Escherichia coli. The NDRS cDNA was appropriately cloned into pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) for production of recombinant NDRS. The wild-type and mutant N and NDRS cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-5X (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) using EcoRI and SalI sites to generate the GSTfusion proteins. Subsequently, the cDNAs encoding mutant N proteins were cloned into pGEX-5X. The pET15b-FLAG used for in vitro transcription of an RNA probe was constructed by insertion of the FLAG-epitope coding sequence into NheI and BamHI. The in vitro translation reporter pFL-SV40 was constructed by replacing the renilla luciferase of pRL-SV40 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with the firefly luciferase.",

Functional motifs and domains are depicted as previously described. Alignment of the RS-rich motifs was performed using CLUSTALW of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (Hinxton, UK). The arginine and serine residues of the RS motif are highlighted in gray. The accession number of the indicated coronavirus N proteins is: feline coronavirus (FCoV; BAC01161), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRC; CAA80841), mouse MHV (P03416), human SARS coronavirus (AAP37024) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (AAA46214).

(A) HEK293 cells that transiently expressed FLAG-tagged fulllength N protein (lane 1) or NDRS (lane 2) were fed [ 32 P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins was performed using anti-FLAG; full-length N protein is indicated by the arrow. Lane 3 shows mock-transfection. The lower panel shows anti-SARS-CoV N immunoblotting. (B) Recombinant GST and GST-N (wild-type and DRS) proteins (lower: Coomassie blue staining) were phosphorylated by purified SRPK1 in reactions containing [c-32 P]ATP (upper: autoradiography). (C) The CD spectrum of purified GST-NDRS was monitored in the range 190-250 nm. The y-coordinate shows De. (D) Wild-type and mutant GST-N proteins and GST-NDRS were in vitro phosphorylated by SRPK1 as in (B) (upper: autoradiography; lower: Coomassie blue staining).
