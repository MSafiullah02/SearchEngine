In March 2020, the US stock market hit the circuit breaker mechanism four times in ten days. Since its inception in 1987, the breaker has only ever been triggered once, in 1997. Together with the US crash, stock markets in Europe and Asia have plunged. FTSE, the UK's main index, dropped more than 10% on 12 March, 2020, in its worst day since 1987. 2 The stock market in Japan plunged more than 20% from its high in December 2019. 3 Central banks and authorities responded immediately by throwing their policy instruments into the market. For example, on 15 March, 2020, the Federal Reserve (FED) announced a zero-percent interest rate policy and at least a $700 billion quantitative easing (QE) program. Following the negative responses to this policy in the market, the FED announced an unlimited QE policy eight days later. Although most stock markets have recently begun rebounding, a great deal of uncertainty remains as the pandemic continues. 1 https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-ma rch-2020 2 https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51829852 3 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-09/perfect-storm-is-plunging-asia-stocks-to-bear-markets-one-by-one To give a first-hand description of the scenario and to understand the patterns of systemic risk in financial markets, this paper explores the available data in an attempt to answer the following questions: How do risks in stock markets react to the pandemic outbreak?

One week later, the WHO declared the outbreak in China to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). At that point, the total number of confirmed cases were 7,711, with only 83 cases in 18 countries outside of China. 4 (Insert Figure 1 here) South Korea was the second country to experience a major outbreak of COVID-19, closely followed by Iran. It took one week for South Korea to go from 31 cases to over 1,000; it took 12 days for Iran to go from zero cases to over 1,000. Using the data from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the confirmed cases can be plotted over time for the six majorly affected countries (see Figure 1 ). While China and South Korea are generally under control in March, the epicentre moved to Europe and the US. With the US leading the total number of confirmed cases, Italy has the highest fatality rate.
