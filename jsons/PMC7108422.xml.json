Four species, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, are recognized as natural malaria parasites of humans. More recently, it has emerged that a fifth species, Plasmodium knowlesi, that morphologically resembles P. malariae and consequently has undoubtedly been misdiagnosed in the past, is a human pathogen [1]. The main simian Plasmodium parasites infecting Old World primates include P. knowlesi, Plasmodium coatneyi, Plasmodium fragile, Plasmodium cynomolgi, Plasmodium inui, Plasmodium fieldi, and Plasmodium simiovale, in South East Asia, as well as Plasmodium gonderi in Africa, while simian Plasmodium parasites infecting New World primates comprise Plasmodium brasilianum and Plasmodium simium in South America [2].",

The host specificity of malaria parasites is narrow such that the only suitable NHP species that can be infected with P. falciparum, P. vivax or P. malariae are some neotropical primates: South American owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.) [40], [41]. Furthermore, the parasites must be adapted to grow in these non-natural hosts. Only P. ovale cannot be adapted to these New World monkeys. The susceptibility to infection by sporozoites and/or iRBCs, the production of viable gametocytes, the characteristics of the blood-stage infection and the requirement for splenectomy all depend on the host/strain combination. The Colombian Night Monkey (Aotus lemurinus griseimembra) may emerge as one of the best NHP malaria models because of its high susceptibility to infection both by blood forms and by sporozoites of both P. falciparum and P. vivax\n[42]. Saimiri sciureus is used to investigate P. falciparum blood-stage human parasites, but splenectomy is required for reproducible high parasitemia after injection of parasitized RBCs [43]. Saimiri boliviensis is considered as the most reliable model for P. vivax\n[41].",

Experimental infections have been described in a wide range of NHPs, from Old World primates rhesus macaques and baboon (Papio spp.) to New World primates, such as squirrel and Aotus monkeys and the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Interestingly, there are two opposed asexual-blood stage outcomes in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques: P. knowlesi causes severe disease, inevitably lethal if untreated, after inoculation of rhesus macaques with sporozoites or iRBCs, whereas parasite development is controlled and chronic infection develops in its natural host, cynomolgus macaques. Parasitemia needs to be monitored daily because P. knowlesi has an asexual life cycle of about 24 h and the parasites can increase quickly to detrimental levels. The model of P. knowlesi in macaques is mainly used for investigating parasite biology, physiopathology and immunology, and for vaccine studies [47], [48], [49].",

This is especially true as in vivo imaging technologies, which have revolutionized our understanding of malaria in the last few years using mouse models, are actually not limited to small laboratory animals. However, insufficient access to adequate structures and equipment for imaging NHPs associated with suitable confinement for class 2 and 3 pathogens, in large part explains the relatively limited exploration of pathogen transmission and dissemination using in vivo imaging in NHPs. Nevertheless, in vivo imaging is entirely feasible in larger animals such as monkeys [68], [69]; even though adult male Aotus monkeys and rhesus macaques weigh about 1 and 8 kg on average, respectively, and are about 35 and 55 cm long, respectively [70] (mice weigh 20\u201330 g and are 6 cm long).",

            "text": "Fluorescence imaging and bioluminescence imaging involve the detection of visible light and are therefore limited to the study of superficial organs; they have mainly been used in small animals. The feasibility of using bioluminescence to visualize infection by, and dissemination of, various viruses, such as murine herpes virus, mouse hepatitis virus, coronavirus, or Chikungunya virus, has been demonstrated in murine models [73], [74], [75]. The relative ease of use and the relatively low cost of these imaging techniques make them useful for the exploration of superficial organs even in large animals. Furthermore, with adapted endoscopic and intraoperative techniques, fluorescence could be used to study deeper organs. Traditional confocal microscopy can image at depths up to 100 \u03bcm. Intravital multiphoton imaging with multiphoton excitation can extend this limit up to a maximum of 1 mm in living animals [76], which is a huge advantage, especially when excision of the specimen is not possible. Recently, two-photon microscopy has been used for imaging and analyzing immune responses in single cells in intact tissues and for time-lapse imaging of living tissues. Indeed, the use of a pulsed infrared laser for fluorescent dye excitation was a major advance [77]: the high excitation wavelength allows deep tissue imaging and its relatively low energy, constrained to the focal plane, limits phototoxicity. As a consequence, two-photon microscopy has become the technique of choice to follow the dynamic behavior of immune cells in vivo; single cells can be studied in murine models of tumors, skin graft or infection [78], [79], [80]. For instance, intravital two-photon microscopy of the popliteal lymph nodes in mice was used to investigate how fluorescently labeled inactivated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is captured from the lymph and transported into the B cell compartment to induce humoral immunity [81]. It has also been used to investigate the dynamic behavior of T cells infected with green fluorescent protein- (GFP-) expressing HIV in the stromal environment of lymph nodes [82]. Intravital microscopy of the skin or surgically exposed internal organs offer excellent resolution for studying individual cells or even subcellular structures and microorganisms [83], [84], although this is not strictly noninvasive. However, this technique has only been applied to murine models.",

The sensitivity of PET is high, in the range of 10\u2212 11 to 10\u2212 12\n mol/L, and is independent of the location, or depth, of the reporter probe. Combining morphological/anatomical and molecular imaging methods, using multimodality hardware and/or co-registration post-acquisition processing, allows whole-body exploration of the early events in the transmission of pathogens through mucosal barriers, assessment of the dynamics of pathogen biodistribution, evaluation of the dynamics of early events following vaccinations, and determination of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new drugs in infected hosts. CT (computed tomography) and MRI can be combined with PET or SPECT to provide anatomical references [85]. MRI gives good spatial resolution allowing both anatomical imaging and molecular imaging, if associated with contrast agents, for cell tracking, characterization of inflammation or cancer cell detection [86], [87], [88].

            "text": "The variety of imaging technologies available for the examination of living material is increasing rapidly. The choice of imaging technology for a study should be based on the biological issues to be resolved and the organ(s) or tissues to be explored. For Plasmodium infection and malaria studies, the organs and tissues of interest (e.g. skin, blood, lymph, liver, spleen, lungs or brain) depend on the malaria stage, transmission, and liver- and blood-stages. Similarly, the forms of the pathogen differ during parasitic development. Mosquitoes inject sporozoites into the skin. Sporozoites are characterized by their size (10\u201315 \u03bcm in length and 1 \u03bcm in diameter), their mobility, and their characteristics of migration from skin to liver, including the speed, the gliding motility and the cell traversal. After productive invasion of hepatocytes, parasites develop in the parasitophorous vacuole until the egress of merosomes from liver cells, with or without dormant hypnozoite formation, depending on the Plasmodium spp. After merosomes burst in the microvasculature, merozoites (1.5\u20132.5 \u03bcm in length and 1.0\u20132.0 \u03bcm in diameter) are released and invade RBCs. The resulting iRBCs can bind non-infected RBCs (rosetting), and adhere to endothelial cells of the microvasculature (sequestration). The rupture of schizont-infected erythrocytes releases new merozoites. Some parasites eventually differentiate into male and female gametocytes (up to 10 \u03bcm in length and 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter) that can be ingested by mosquitoes. Therefore, the strategy for in vivo imaging of Plasmodium infection and malaria, and thus the choice of imaging techniques, should be adapted to the resolution, depth of penetration, and sensitivity required. Multi-modal imaging approaches are entirely feasible.",

To analyze the migration of parasites, transgenic parasites expressing GFP [116], [117], red fluorescent protein (RFP) [118] or a GFP\u2013luciferase fusion protein [119] were used. Fluorescent P. berghei sporozoites have been used to study mosquito and mammalian host interactions in the dermis with malaria parasites by in vivo microscopy [116], [117], [120], [121], [122]. Not all sporozoites reach the liver. Some enter lymph vessels and accumulate in the draining lymph node, where they appear to reside for some time before being degraded [120]; others remain in the skin. It is possible to observe and count the number of fluorescent parasites that are ejected from the mosquito over time [123].

The generation of transgenic parasites that contain an imaging-reporter gene, either a fluorescent reporter or an enzymatic reporter, such as luciferase or tk, is essential for in vivo imaging. Exogenous genes can be introduced either on a plasmid or by homologous recombination of a linear DNA fragment into the parasite genome, targeted to a silent chromosomal locus without alteration of the phenotype of the parasite after disruption, such as the dispensable Pf47 locus in P. falciparum. Episomal plasmids containing origins of replication derived from bacteria do replicate in Plasmodium; they are not equally segregated into daughter cells during mitosis and they may be lost. Stable episomal transfection is however possible, and differs from transient episomal transfection by the presence of a selection marker in the transfected DNA. Multiple rounds of drug treatment allow selecting parasites with crossover integration of episomes. For comprehensive reviews and detailed protocols, see [146], [147], [148], [149]. Briefly, the asexual stage has a haploid genome and thus is the preferred stage for the generation of transgenic parasites because it requires modification of only a single allele. Optimal conditions have been defined for electroporation and for nucleofection ensuring the access of exogenous DNA to the parasite nucleus while preserving viability. Transfection efficiencies differ according to the developmental stage of the parasite and the Plasmodium species. Infected erythrocytes containing ring-stage parasites (P. falciparum) or mature schizonts (P. berghei) can be used for genetic manipulations, and transfected (e.g. resistant or fluorescent) parasites can be selected and cloned either in vivo or in vitro. Various promoters, both homologous and heterologous, with different strengths and timing of activity, e.g. stage-specific, conditional or constitutive, are available for use in these species.",

There are several transgenic P. falciparum expressing an imaging reporter gene during blood-stage. They are used for in vitro assays, likely because of the lack of gametocyte production. Theoretically, RBCs infected with these transgenic parasites could be used for in vivo imaging of blood-stage. Transgenic P. falciparum expressing an imaging reporter gene throughout the entire parasite life cycle include P. falciparum expressing GFP (3D7HT-GFP) [158], deposited at the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR4) and tested for liver-stage using ex vivo human primary hepatocytes infection; and P. falciparum expressing a luciferase\u2013GFP fusion (NF54HT-GFP\u2013Luc) tested for liver-stage using human liver chimeric mice [23]. They are available for in vivo imaging studies in NHP models of malaria. Recently, a transgenic P. cynomolgi with two expression cassettes for constitutive expression of GFP and mCherry was developed. Ex vivo infection of primary hepatocytes from rhesus monkey was performed and developing liver stage and hypnozoites forms were documented by live fluorescent microscopy [55]. Finally, the adaptation of a P. knowlesi line expressing GFP throughout the asexual blood-stage cycle to continuous culture in human erythrocytes has been recently demonstrated, providing potential tools for studying blood-stage in NHPs [159].",

Consequently, it is unsurprising that in vivo imaging is increasingly linked to primate parasitology, particularly as it becomes clear that in vivo imaging is feasible with larger animals. However, so far, studies using in vivo imaging approaches in NHPs are rare. They have been limited to PET imaging to document inflammation and cerebral malaria in the M. fuscata/P. coatneyi model [106], [111], [112]. Admittedly, facilities where the dual NHP/malaria expertise is available, and have both the desired model up-and-running and appropriate in vivo imaging devices can be difficult to find (Table 1\n). Nevertheless, the list of transgenic parasites encoding an imaging reporter gene usable in NHP models is growing (Table 2\n). To our knowledge, they have not yet been tested in vivo.",

Indeed the in vivo dynamic imaging techniques can reveal differences with in vitro data such as the CD8+T cell-mediated elimination of malaria liver stages [161]. Development of these new imaging tools that are applicable for NHP models will allow a better understanding of the biology of Plasmodium and of the host immune responses against parasites and parasitized cells as well as the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To conclude, in vivo imaging in NHP models of malaria could be very helpful to explore the following top four topics: the study of the early events in transmission to characterize the dynamic of skin stage and liver infection, the longitudinal characterization of hypnozoite forms and infection relapses, the time-lapse imaging of the invasion of red blood cells, and the dynamic imaging of host-parasite interactions and immunity.",
