On March 16, 2020, through Decree 18,884/2020, the government recommended the intensification of measures such as the suspension of collective activities or sporting, cultural, artistic, political, scientific, commercial and religious events; suspension of school classes; monitoring of suspicious cases; isolation for 14 days of travelers or those who had contact with confirmed cases; and the adoption of sanitary measures.",

It is noteworthy that COVID-19 is not the only public health challenge today. Until March 2020, 441,224 probable cases (incidence coefficient of 209.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) of dengue were reported in the country. The Northeast Region had an incidence of 49.5 cases/100,000 inhabitants, with an increasing trend, but still within the expected level (endemic channel). Simultaneously, 2,184 suspected cases of measles were reported, of which 338 (15.5%) were confirmed (incidence rate of 0.8/100,000 inhabitants). In this difficult epidemiological scenario, there is a clear expectation of witnessing a measles, dengue, and COVID-19 syndemia, among other conditions that afflict the Brazilian population 5-7 . In this context, the healthcare system in Piau\u00ed, like other regions of Brazil and the world, is not prepared to face this pandemic that is growing at alarming rates across the world. The rapid spread of the epidemic is partly due to the delay in testing suspected cases, providing results, and isolating patients, in addition to the failure to protect healthcare professionals, resulting in dissemination from healthcare providers 8 . Therefore, the government must immediately pay attention to the need to expand healthcare infrastructure to combat COVID-19. It is necessary for the population and healthcare professionals to be guided to adopt the preventive measures recommended by experts and public health officials. The population must perform hand hygiene and avoid closed environments and avoid contact with people from regions with COVID-19 outbreaks. Healthcare professionals should use protective glasses or face shields, surgical/N95 masks, disposable aprons, and procedure gloves and always wash their hands, especially when aiding suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In this scenario, there is a need for governments to establish their commitment to offering the entire population the mitigation measures recommended to overcome this crisis 9 . In addition, the present scenario highlights the need to strengthen the Brazilian Unified Health System as well as the need for massive investment in research, technology, and innovation to effectively combat public health emergencies in our country.",
