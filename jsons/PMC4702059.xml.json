If the protective mucosal barrier is injured during an endoscopically assisted intervention, the pathogens can enter from exterior or from the surface bacteria, possibly even via the endoscope into the tissue. Thus the infection risk increases with the invasiveness of the intervention [3]. However, even during rhino-neurosurgical surgeries with their inevitably broad opening of the dura, the associated risk is relatively low: the rate of intracranial infections in those maximized interventions is given with 1.6% and the infection-related mortality with 0.125%. It is comparable to the one of transcranial surgeries without endoscope [4].",

High risk patients in this context are people who have been hospitalized during the past 6 months for at least four consecutive days and who meet additionally the following criteria: known MRSA history and/or at least one of the following risk factors: chronic need for care (at least nursing category 1), antibiotic therapy within the past six months, catheterization (e.g. urinal catheter, PEG tube), patients requiring dialysis, skin ulcus/gangrene/chronic wounds/deep soft tissue infections.

The user is responsible for the correct classification of the medical devices in consideration of the manufacturer\u2019s data. Endoscopes used in otorhinolaryngology do not have a working channel, they are only in contact with (probably pathological) mucosa or skin and as they do not penetrate them during diagnostic measures, they are classified as medical device of the category \u201csemicritical A\u201d. For the reprocessing of medical devices classified higher than \u201csemicritical A\u201d, the medical and nursing staff have to dispose of a special knowledge that can be acquired in the context of special trainings and courses, e.g. certificate of competence in \u201cprocessing of endoscopes\u201d or other courses with a curriculum in accordance to DGSV.",

Still, automatic reprocessing is preferred due to the reduced time and personnel costs and an easier standardization. While the validation of automatic reprocessing is often performed by the manufacturer [22], [23], validation of manual reprocessing (including every single step) must be provided by the user himself or on his behalf. Disinfectants must be VAH-certified and recommended by the manufacturer to ensure effectiveness as well as compatibility with the materials of the medical device. The same principle is applied to previous cleaning and final rinsing, i.e. every single step of the whole process must be defined, validated, and determined in an SOP. Considering the manufacturer\u2019s data, the responsible person writes down and determines the procedures that are applied (every single step) and the conditions (e.g. rooms, equipment, qualification of the staff) under which his medical devices are reprocessed and stored. The SOPs have to mention explicitly all critical steps of the process. They are periodically checked in order to prove the continuous effectiveness.",

According to the KRINKO-BfArM recommendation [1] the disinfectant has to have a bactericidal (including mycobacteria), fungicidal, and virucidal effect. In contrast, the guideline of the DGKH, DGSV, AKI, and VAH regarding the manual reprocessing contains reduced requirements concerning the range of effects [2]. If the olfactory epithelium is penetrated or biopsies are taken from the olfactory region, the view is taken that reprocessing should also assure the effectiveness against prions [1]. With regard to the still unknown actual risk of this aspect, these circumstances should be analyzed more intensively in order to avoid writing down possibly exaggerated and precipitate demands. ",

After that, the endoscope is rinsed with tap water and dried with lint-free single-use wipes. This procedure is meant to avoid diluting of the disinfectant in the second step. If the olfactory epithelium was definitely penetrated during endoscopy, the endoscope should be put into prion effective agent after pre-cleaning as intermediate step, for example 6 mol GdSCN solution for 15 minutes [26]Afterwards disinfection is performed: the cleaned endoscope is put into the disinfectant solution (options for virucidal agents and application time according to manufacturer\u2019s data). Appropriate trays have to be used. The instruments have to be fully covered by the solution (except the ocular with nozzle for light). No hollow spaces or air bubbles must occur. The predetermined application times and concentrations have to be observed. The handle of the endoscope is cleaned with the same disinfectant that is used for the instrument. The disinfection solution is changed every day and additionally in cases of visible contamination. The trays have to be cleaned and disinfected every day, too, as well as in cases of visible contamination.The third step consists of the final rinsing: after disinfection, the endoscope is rinsed carefully with tap water. As the quality of the water cannot be assured unless continuous microbiological surveillance is performed, terminal sterile filters are necessary [1]. Rinsing is meant to remove remaining disinfectant. The recommended filters can be left in place for 3 months [27].Finally, the external part of the endoscope is dried with a fresh single use wipe and visually checked for clean and intact appearance.Up to the next use, the endoscope has to be stored in a dry and dust-protected place.",

The table reveals that hand disinfection is considered more important for self-protection because the hands are disinfected always after treatment of high risk patients and after contamination, but not before and after every treatment of patients. It is critical that some staff members have artificial or gelled fingernails. There are several reasons to refuse this habit. The density of bacteria on those artificial nails is much higher than on natural ones. At the same time, artificial nails mislead to neglecting washing of the hands and they increase the risk of perforating the protective gloves [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Repeatedly, artificial nails could be identified as reason for surgical site infections [34], [35], [36]. Jewelry for hands and forearms hinder proper hand hygiene and may be a reservoir for pathogens. A correlation between the number of rings and the number of Gram-negative bacteria and Staph. aureus could be found in the intensive care staff [37]. When the nurses had rings on their fingers, an increased rate of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters could be found on the hands, however, an increased transmission rate could not be revealed [38], [39]. Finally, rings increase the risk of injuries as well as the rate of perforations for single-use gloves [40], [41].",

The endoscopes are mostly reprocessed manually. This fact corresponds to data in the literatures: a survey of private practices performing outpatient surgeries (including ENT practices) made by the health authorities of Frankfurt/Main, Germany, showed that the reprocessing of instruments was carried out manually in 93% [43]. In dental practices the situation in 2005 with manual reprocessing was slightly better [44]. A report published 2008 by the Federal Ministry of Health also drew the conclusion that cleaning and disinfection in private practices is nearly always performed manually. The reason is the financial burden [45]. The statement is given that changes of these suboptimal procedures would require specific official instructions [43]. In this sense, the new infection protection law of 2011 [46] and the updated hygiene regulations increase the requirements for the structural and process quality of hospital hygiene. The users have to face stricter planning and documentation obligations with tighter reporting duties, a supervision by the public health service was established [47].",
