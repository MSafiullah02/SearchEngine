(A) The changes in Fig 1A\u2013C on the vertical lines. (B) The effect of reducing human\u2013wildlife contact (decreasing edge effects) to reduce spillover risk. Panel (C) shows that simple linear relationships reducing the loss of biodiversity with no reduction in human contact and population growth could increase the potential for spillover if other factors (e.g. dilution effect) are absent. (D) The ideal scenario from both a human health and biodiversity conservation perspective\u2014rates of loss of biodiversity are reduced as well as contact rate, leading to an overall reduction in spillover risk. Note these simple models make many assumptions, including that spillover risk is a simple product of the human\u2013wildlife contact at edges, human population size and biodiversity.",

In this example, the greatest diversity of viruses is within the very diverse insect populations (black). Insectivorous bats may be exposed to many insect viruses, but only a small fraction of these spill over into bat populations (blue). A fraction of these viruses may then infect humans (red). Cross\u2010species transmission events (aka spillover) are shown by arrows from the species defences (dotted lines). (B) The phylogenetic tree that might be observed if viruses cascade through the ecosystems as proposed. Note the colours in each figure are the same and the three spillover events marked in (A) are shown in coloured circles on the nodes of the phylogenetic tree.",
