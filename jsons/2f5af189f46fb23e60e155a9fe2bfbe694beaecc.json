On admission, the physical examination revealed the patient was afebrile with a blood 21 pressure of 100/58 mm/hg, a heart rate of 70 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 17 22 breaths/minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. She was alert and oriented with 23 pertinent physical exam findings of coarse crackles in bilateral lung fields without wheezing, 24 rhonchi, or increased work of breathing. A chest computed topography (CT) performed in the 25 emergency department demonstrated multifocal opacities, confluent peripheral-predominant 26 ground-glass opacities, and evidence of microvascular dilatation as seen in figure 1 . The 27 laboratory examination on admission showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.8 x 28 10 9 cell/L with decreased absolute lymphocyte count 0.77 x 10 9 /L that was normal at 1.42 x 29 10 9 /L 11 days prior. Routine blood tests, electrolytes, renal function, liver function, and serum 30 procalcitonin were within normal range for the labs reported. Her C reactive protein was higher 31 than normal range at 16.66 mg/dL. The total serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 1710 mg/dL 32 (within normal range), immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 33 mg/dL (low), and immunoglobulin A 33 (IgA) was <7 mg/dL (undetectable). The antigen tests for influenza A and B and respiratory 34 syncytial virus were negative. The patient was admitted with suspected SARS-CoV-2 with a 35 nasopharyngeal swab test of SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay pending 36",

Consideration was given to start azithromycin; however, she had an adverse drug reaction 42 history. 43 On hospital day 4 the patient had progressive shortness of breath with increasing oxygen 44 supplementation required. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and placed on 45 non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with continuous positive airway pressure 46 47 required mechanical ventilation. Subsequent chest radiography showed evidence of acute 48 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as seen in figure 1. The patient remained intubated for 3 49 days before she was successfully extubated. Over the next 4 days she improved clinically and 50 oxygen supplementation was weaned to room air. The SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR 51 remained positive on hospital day 13. She was discharged home the next day. 52 Several potential treatments have emerged including the use of chloroquine anti-malarial 53 therapy. Hydroxychloroquine, an analogue of chloroquine, has been demonstrated to have anti-54 SARs-CoV activity in vitro. 6 Our patient's home dose was increased from 200 mg 55 hydroxychloroquine BID to 200 mg TID during her hospitalization, it is unknown if the dosing 56 regimen affected the course of her disease. The patient received IVIG prior to admission and was 57 further supplemented during hospitalization. These infusions were not derived from plasma with 58 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and limited evidence of its efficacy currently exists. 7 59 Recently, 2 patients in Italy with x-linked agammaglobulinemia developed COVID-19 60 pneumonia but did not require intensive care or mechanical ventilation. 7 Similarly to our patient, 61 they were on chronic IVIG with normal IgG levels at time of diagnosis and received additional 62 IVIG during hospitalization. In comparison, our patient developed ARDS and required 63 mechanical ventilation. It can be speculated that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase mutation may have 64 further protected those patients from developing severe inflammatory disease. 7 As we learn more 65 about SARS-CoV-2 and the course of disease in patients with different primary 66 immunodeficiencies we will likely gain valuable knowledge of the immune system's response to 67 COVID-19. 68 Immunosuppression may be beneficial in preventing mortality increasing 69 hyperinflammatory syndrome and cytokine storm brought on by COVID-19 activating host 70 immune responses including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, ferritin, and tumor necrosis factor-71 among others. 8 It is unknown if our patient developed cytokine storm as markers were not 72 evaluated; however, she developed ARDS signifying pulmonary hyperinflammation. The patient 73 was able to fully recover despite her immunodeficiency with underlying lung disease and did not 74 require extended ventilatory support. It is undeterminable if our patient's inability to mount of 75 full immune response and immunoregulation with chronic hydroxychloroquine and IVIG 76 juxtaposed with her autoimmune disease as well as tamoxifen therapy affected the pathogenesis 77 of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant favorable outcome in this patient. It is unknown if the addition of 78 tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, would have offered further protective benefit. We describe the 79 first clinical observation of COVID-19 infection in a patient with CVID, bronchiectasis, and 80 autoimmune disease on chronic hydroxychloroquine and her recovery.",
