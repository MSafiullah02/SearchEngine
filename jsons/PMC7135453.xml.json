            "text": "Two main anatomic areas are heavily colonized with normal flora that may contribute to the development of head and neck infections: the oral cavity/upper respiratory tract and the skin. The flora at these two sites is similar qualitatively but may differ quantitatively. Organisms generally considered as commensals include coagulase-negative staphylococci, nonhemolytic and viridans streptococci, Corynebacterium spp, micrococci, saprophytic Neisseria spp, Haemophilus spp, and a wide range of anaerobes including Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, and Veillonella. Other organisms commonly found at these sites but often thought of as pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae (serotype B, other serotypes, and non-typeable strains), H parainfluenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Eikenella, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Actinomyces spp [1], [2]. Spirochetes also are present in the oral cavity [3]. Gram-negative facultative organisms such as Escherichia coli and environmental organisms such as Pseudomonas spp are not generally part of the normal flora at these sites in healthy individuals. Fungi other than Candida spp and parasites are not components of the normal flora in the head and neck region. Viruses also are not part of the normal flora; however, some, such as the herpes viruses, can remain latent and become reactivated. Thus, recovery of these agents such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV), must be interpreted in the clinical context.",

In addition, the normal flora may change depending on age, general health, hygiene, antibiotics, smoking, hospitalization, and other conditions [2], [4]. For example, an antecedent viral respiratory tract infection is known to increase colonization by S aureus and gram-negative bacilli [5]. In the presence of predisposing factors, such as immunosuppression, local tissue trauma, or dental disease, this complex flora consisting mostly of low-virulence organisms leads to local infections that often are polymicrobial. Unfortunately, even with organisms considered true pathogens, there is no fool-proof way to distinguish in the laboratory whether the organism detected is just a commensal or is the true offending agent. This difficulty underscores the importance of proper specimen collection and the need to correlate laboratory data with clinical information. In particular, relevant host factors should be kept in mind when interpreting microbiologic data and considering empiric antimicrobial therapy.",

Syringes should not be used for transport of specimen, both for safety and for specimen integrity. Collection of specimens with swabs should be avoided, particularly when a fastidious organism is suspected or if aspirates or biopsies are obtainable. If swabs are used, it is best to submit two separate specimens, one for direct examination and the second for culture. Cotton swabs, which may contain fatty acids that can inhibit the survival of certain fastidious organisms, should be avoided. Dacron or Rayon polyester-tipped swabs may be used if submitted in the appropriate transport media, such as Amies or Stuart's medium. Care should be taken to avoid drying out of the swab. Commercially available viral transport medium stabilizes viruses, inhibit overgrowth by bacteria and fungi, and should be used for swab specimens. Viral transport medium also is appropriate for viral antigen detection and nucleic acid tests [7]. For specimens from sterile sites such as vitreous fluid, transport in a sterile container is preferred, and viral transport medium is not required.",

Developed more than a century ago, it remains the first step in the microbiologic evaluation of most clinical specimens. A properly prepared Gram stain allows the detection of the number and general type of bacteria and also of the presence and nature of the inflammatory response. This information is particularly important for assessing whether the specimen sampled is from an infected site or whether the organisms present are more representative of the commensal flora. Also, the Gram stain is more likely to provide information about the most predominant organisms at the infected site, whereas cultures favor more rapidly growing bacteria that may mask other, more fastidious organisms that may be the true pathogens. When assessing the inflammatory response, the presence of many polymorphonuclear white blood cells suggests a bacterial cause, whereas the predominance of mononuclear white blood cells suggests viral or other agents that cause more chronic infections. Visualizing organisms within neutrophils (eg, the lancet-shaped gram-positive diplococci typical of S pneumoniae) suggests a causal relation with the patient's infection. Unfortunately, the Gram stain lacks specificity, and only rarely is the Gram stain appearance sufficient for a definitive identification; additional testing is usually necessary.",

Mycobacteria spp have a very lipid-rich cell wall that results in intense staining that cannot be removed by an acid decolorizing agent, hence the name \u201cacid-fast bacilli.\u201d Examples of acid-fast stains include the auramine or auramine-rhodamine stain, Kinyoun stain, and Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The auramine stain is based on nonspecific binding of fluorochromes to mycolic acids present in the mycobacterial cell wall and is more sensitive and rapid than the other stains. Nocardia spp may be detected by Gram stain as long, slender, gram-positive branching bacilli but are partially acid-fast and can be identified more definitively using a modified acid-fast stain similar to that used for mycobacteria but with a less harsh decolorizing agent. Fungi may be seen on Gram stain but often are overlooked and are best visualized in specimens using a wet-mount made with calcofluor white. The latter is a nonspecific fluorochrome that binds to cellulose and chitin, allowing detection of fungal elements using a fluorescent microscope [8]. Calcofluor white is often combined with potassium hydroxide that helps breakdown the background cellular material, allowing better visualization of hyphae and yeasts. Potassium hydroxide can be used alone to prepare wet mounts for the detection of fungi if calcofluor white is not available but is less sensitive because of difficulty in visualizing fungal elements. Viruses can only be seen directly by electron microscopy. Parasites are detected primarily by examination of smears after concentration and staining, and specific requests should be submitted.",

            "text": "A variety of commercial products is available to detect antigens of micro-organisms directly in specimens or from organisms growing in culture. These assays fall under the large umbrella of immunoassays, because most use antibodies or antigens to detect complementary antigen or antibody in clinical specimens or from culture growth. Examples of these methods include precipitation reactions, latex agglutination, flocculation, direct and indirect fluorescent immunoassays, enzyme-linked immunoassays, and optical immunoassays. These methods have evolved extensively since first introduced, with improvements in ease of performance, sensitivity, specificity, cost effectiveness, and the adaptation to automation. These tests have several advantages including (1) detection of organisms before culture results are available, (2) detection of uncultivable or fastidious pathogens, (3) detection of organisms that might be unsafe to handle in the laboratory, and (4) detection of microbial products such as toxins. The pathogen-specific nature of these assays also is one of their disadvantages, however, because it limits each test to a single pathogen, and the tests often are valid for a limited range of specimen types. Some organisms that can be detected using these tests include Chlamydia trachomatis, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group A streptococci, Cryptococcus neoformans, and a variety of viruses including influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, HSV, and VZV. An antigen-detection method is available for the presence of S pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, N meningitidis, and H influenzae type B in sterile body fluids. Most H influenzae involved in head and neck infections are non-typeable, however, and these methods reportedly are no more sensitive than an accurately performed and interpreted Gram stain, making them not very useful clinically [9]. The early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by the detection of circulating Aspergillus cell wall antigens (galactomannan and beta-d-glucan) has been evaluated primarily in patients who had hematologic malignancies. The combination of galactomannan enzyme-linked immunoassays with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) seems to improve sensitivity and specificity for the detection of Aspergillus in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, but its application in head and neck infections remains to be determined [10], [11], [12], [13].",

With the existence of other amplification methods such as transcription-mediated amplification and strand displacement amplification, molecular testing should be referred to more appropriately as \u201cnucleic acid amplification testing\u201d (NAT or NAAT). There are numerous NAT assays for the detection of various bacteria, viruses, and parasites directly from clinical specimens, but these tests tend to be organism specific. For example, PCR tests with primers specifically targeting influenza A virus or Bordetella pertussis genomes are available and can be used routinely to detect these organisms from nasopharyngeal washes [16], [17]. Detection of specific virulence genes is also available, such as PCR for shiga-like toxins from fecal samples in patients who have bloody diarrhea. The unique advantages and disadvantages of each amplification procedure are beyond the scope of this article. Depending on the assay used, the sensitivity, specificity, cost, and speed may vary. Sequence-based analysis is particularly useful for organisms that are poorly cultivable or for accurate species identification when traditional phenotypic methods have failed. In particular, analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences has greatly expanded the phylogenic identification of bacteria. The 16S rRNA gene is universal and is highly conserved in bacteria but has sufficient variability in certain regions to allow genus- or species-specific identification. The gene sequences are compared with a large, publicly available reference databank to determine identical or closest-related organisms.

This infection may begin in the external canal but aggressively invades the soft tissues, including cartilage and temporal bone, and may lead to petrous osteomyelitis. Cultures of purulent drainage from the external canal or biopsy specimens reveal the offending pathogen.",

Primary HIV infection also is associated with acute pharyngitis and viremia. Investigation for the specific viral cause of acute tonsillopharyngitis usually is not performed except when HIV or infectious mononucleosis is suspected. Approximately 30% of the cases of acute tonsillopharyngitis are caused by bacteria, most commonly group A streptococci [44]. Because it is not possible to distinguish bacterial from viral causes by clinical presentation alone, laboratory studies should be performed to exclude the possibility of group A streptococcus to avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Other beta-hemolytic streptococci, such as groups C and G, also have been reported to cause acute pharyngitis but rarely are associated with postinfectious complications. Arcanobacterium hemolyticum has been reported to cause a scarlet fever-like syndrome that occurs primarily in late adolescents and young adults [45], [46]. Other less common causes of acute pharyngitis include N gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium ulcerans, Yersinia enterocolitica, T pallidum, and Francisella tularensis.

Species often can be identified by standard phenotypic methods using commercial systems. Other common causative agents that can cause Lemierre's disease include Bacteroides spp and Prevotella spp.",

The majority of infections result from commensal organisms that are part of the normal flora of the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and the skin. Other pathogens such as Mycobacterium spp, invasive fungi, and a host of viruses also cause disease in this area. Key to successful laboratory diagnosis includes recognizing the likely causative agents, determining the best specimen type for investigation, avoiding contamination from commensal organisms during specimen collection, and communication with the clinical microbiology laboratory regarding specimen collection, transport, and testing for suspected pathogens.",
