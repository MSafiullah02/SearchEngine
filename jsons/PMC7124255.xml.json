This is possible because the accumulating evidence shows that there are several mutations in SARS related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). So far 15 point mutations have been documented in SARS-CoV proteins: two in the 221 amino-acid-long membrane glycoprotein [2], [15], [17], [19], [24], three in the 1255 amino-acid-long spike glycoprotein [2], [15], [17], [24] and ten in the 7073 amino-acid-long replicase polyprotein [2], [8], [11], [15], [16], [17], [24]. Naturally we would expect these three SARS-CoV proteins to have other forms of mutations rather than those documented, and the new mutations would lead to the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of SARS.",

The spike proteins of coronaviruses are large, type I membrane glycoproteins that are responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion. The spike proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. S proteins also contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes, and amino acid changes in the spike proteins can dramatically affect the virulence and in vitro host cell tropism of the virus [6], [7], [22]. Still at present it is only the spike glycoprotein, in which a considerable amount of mutations has been documented. Using the Blastp program to align three spike glycoproteins from humans, we find little cue on the likelihood of which amino acid would mutate in SARS spike glycoprotein.",

Because there are 20 types of amino acids, an amino acid pair can be composed from any of 20 types of amino acids so there are 400 types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs. Again there are 1254 pairs in the spike protein, which are more than 400 types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs, clearly some of 400 types should appear more than once. Meanwhile we may expect that some of 400 types are absent from the spike protein. Similarly there are 1172 and 1352 amino acid pairs in the spike proteins from strain 229E and OC43, respectively.",

For the numerical analysis, we calculate the difference between actual frequency (AF) and predicted frequency (PF) in amino acid pairs before and after mutation, i.e. \u03a3(AF\u2212PF). For instance, a mutation at position 244 substitutes \u201cI\u201d to \u201cT\u201d which results in two amino acid pairs \u201cDI\u201d and \u201cIW\u201d changing to \u201cDT\u201d and \u201cTW\u201d, because the amino acid is \u201cD\u201d at position 243 and \u201cW\u201d at position 245. The actual frequency and predicted frequency are 7 and 5 for \u201cDI\u201d, 1 and 1 for \u201cIW\u201d, 2 and 6 for \u201cDT\u201d, and 0 and 1 for \u201cTW\u201d, respectively. Thus, the difference between actual frequency and predicted frequency is 2 with regard to the substituted amino acid pairs, i.e. (7\u22125)+(1\u22121)=2, and \u22125 with regard to the substituting amino acid pairs, i.e. (2\u22126)+(0\u22121)=\u22125. In this way, we can compare the frequency difference in the amino acid pairs affected by mutations. Fig. 2\nshows the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in both substituted and substituting amino acid pairs in spike proteins. It can be seen that the substituting pairs distribute more centrally and symmetrically than the substituted pairs do. The sum of differences between actual and predicted frequencies is statistically smaller in substituting amino acid pairs than in substituted ones in Table 3\n(the Student\u2019s t-test, P<0.05). These statistical differences suggest that the mutations lead to the deduction of difference between actual and predicted frequencies. From a probabilistic viewpoint, this means that the mutations are more likely to occur, and these findings are similar to the results in our recent studies [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34].",

As such a pathway is less energy- and time-consuming, in fact, the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases. Although this study shows that the mutations in the spike proteins from strains 229E and OC43 go along the direction of degeneration, i.e. the mutations go along a probabilistically easy pathway, the documented evidence in literature still cannot suggest whether or not the mutations belong to degeneration in the spike protein from human SARS-CoV.",

Table 6\nlists the amino acid pairs with the frequency difference being larger than 3 in spike protein from SARS-CoV, as these amino acid pairs seem to be more vulnerable to mutations (Fig. 1). With these sensitive amino acid pairs in mind, we can easily determine their positions. For example, the \u201cNF\u201ds are located at positions 129\u2013130, 178\u2013179, 230\u2013231, 304\u2013305, 526\u2013527, 528\u2013529, 699\u2013700, 783\u2013784, 951\u2013952, 1056\u20131057 and 1090\u20131091 in spike protein from SARS-CoV. Moreover we notice that the positions of \u201cFN\u201ds overlap with \u201cNF\u201ds at positions from 526 to 530, at which the highly possible mutations would be more likely to occur. This hypothesis can be supported by the mutations found in other proteins, such as human collagen \u03b15(IV) chain precursor [29], p53 protein [34] and so on. In such a manner, we could predict the potential mutations in the spike protein from human SARS-CoV with possible amino acid pairs and positions.",
