Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 132 immunosuppressed children who underwent FB and BAL because pulmonary complications between January 1999 and May 2014 at the Hacettepe University Hospital Pediatric Pulmonology Unit.

Results: FB and BAL were diagnostic in 86/132 patients (65.1%) and the antimicrobial treatment changed for 75/132 patients (56.8%). The most common pathogen was bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading one). Bacteria were more frequent in Group I than Group II (P = .008).

Likewise, treatment changes were also reported in 65.8%, 17% and 56%, respectively, of the patients whose BAL samples were negative for pathogenic agents. In our study, among all patients whose treatment was changed, 67/75 patients (89.3%) had their treatment increased, whereas only 8/75 patients (10.7%) had their treatment modified to narrow their current treatment (Table 5 ). In the overwhelming majority of the patients in Group I, the rate of therapy escalation (n = 57, 90.5%) was more prominent, especially the addition of antibiotics (43/57 vs 2/10 patients), because bacterial pathogens were more prevalent in Group I than in Group II (P = .008). Bacterial diversity was high in BAL results and the antimicrobial agents at the time of FB did not cover most pathogens.

We explain this slight discrepancy because in our immunosuppressed population, after observable positive BAL results, adding therapy seems reasonable, but the cessation of antimicrobial agents is more difficult in this critical population. In addition, we included patients who changed from prophylaxis to a treatment dose for some antibiotics (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin-sulbactam) and lengthening the duration of current treatment as a treatment change and this would count as an additive effect to our escalation rate. Additionally, these findings point out the overuse of antibiotics and the tendency to continue their use, even in cases without any objective evidence supporting their use.

These results may be related to the protective effect of prophylactic antibiotics that had been administered since the beginning of the BMT process as well as the preparation regimens that cause T-cell depletion in order to prevent the occurrence of graft versus host disease, both of which may play a critical role in the increased frequency of the presence of viral and opportunistic agents in BMT patients.
