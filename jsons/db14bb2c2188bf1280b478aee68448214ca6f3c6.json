To better analysis public awareness of this issue, we use the following search terms \"2019-nCoV\" \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"novel coronavirus\", \"new coronavirus\", \"COVID-19\" and \"Corona Virus Disease 2019\" (which were most searched) to investigate public awareness of COVID-19 in six major English-speaking countries from both hemispheres. Additionally, plus sign (+) which means \"OR\" was used to represent the combination of those multiple terms. These queries were searched from 2019/12/31 to 2020/02/24 within the countries from the Northern hemisphere, including the USA, the UK, Canada and Ireland as well as countries from the Southern hemisphere, including Australia and New Zealand. These countries were selected because they reflect the major native English-speaking countries in both hemispheres, and the searches were conducted on the 28 th February VIEWPOINTS RESEARCH THEME 6: COVID-19 PANDEMIC 2020. For the purpose of comparing the difference of public response to the topic about COVID-19 across countries, we defined two novel definitions to make the comparisons easier: response time and duration of public attention. Response time refers to the time between the day when WHO received the report, and to the first day when the RSV started to occur. While the duration of public attention refers to the time between the day when RSV started to occur to the day it reached the apex (time points at both ends were included in response time and duration of public attention). To analysis the difference between the Northern and Southern hemisphere, we get the data which represent the RSV related to COVID-19 in the Northern hemisphere by adding up the daily RSV in the USA, the UK, Canada and Ireland. Using the same way, we get the data in the Southern hemisphere by combining the daily RSV in Australia and New Zealand. Besides, since the RSV in the United States is less than \"1\" for several days, we treated it as RSV equal to \"1\" in these days for better reflecting the American response to COVID-19.",

However, other countries did not pay much attention to SARS-CoV-2 until the National Health Commission of China has listed SARS-CoV-2 as class B infectious disease and treated as Class A for infection prevention and control management on th 20 th January 2020 [9] . This indicates this novel coronavirus can be a severe threat to public health. This may be a reason that the search trends about COVID-19 reached the highest increment speed near the 20 th January 2020. Besides, the first confirmed case with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by the WHO in the USA, and Australia is on the 21 st January 2020 and the 25 th January 2020, respectively [9] . Coincidentally, the day when the second-highest increment speed occurred is exactly the day when the first infected case was reported. Also, the first peak value of the RSV regarding COVID-19 in Canada occurred on the 25 th January 2020, while the first confirmed case was also reported on the same day. According to the WHO' s report on the 30 th January 2020 that the outbreak of COVID-19 meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEC). Which indicates that this epidemic may not only post a severe threat to the health and well-being of Chinese people, but may have also posed stress on the economy of the whole world. So, the summit of RSV occurred around the 31 st January 2020 in most countries from both hemispheres. The peak value of RSV regarding COVID-19 in the UK occurred on the 31 st January 2020 may also because of the first confirmed case within the UK was reported on that day. Also, until the 24 th February 2020, there were no confirmed cases had been reported in Ireland and New Zealand, which may contribute to the highest increment speed in Ireland and New Zealand occurred later than the other four countries. Besides, the response time in Ireland and New Zealand was also longer than that in other countries, which indicates the public in these countries had a lower vigilance to COVID-19 compared with people in the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada. The official names of the novel coronavirus and diseases caused by this virus were confirmed on th e11 th Feb 2020, which may lead to the emergence of the second apex for RSV about COVID-19. Besides, the first cluster of passengers detected negatively of SARS-CoV-2, began leaving the Diamond Princess and back to their own countries on th e19 th February 2020. Thus, people' s interest in COVID-19 increased again from the 19 th February 2020, and with the case number soaring worldwide, the search trend keeps increasing.",

The health care system within the United States plays a critical role in enhancing public awareness toward health-related issues. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), multiple other federal and local agencies, as well as other partners and health departments have implemented robust methods to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 in the USA [21, 22] . Besides, according to the statistics from the WHO and CDC that up to more than 19 million people have been diagnosed with influenza in America, with more than 10 thousand fatalities as of the 25 th January 2020. So, the public in America may be more sensitive to the topic regarding COVID-19 than in other countries. According to Matt Hancock, England' s health secretary, that England has a world-leading infection control procedure [23] . Before the first confirmed cases had been found in England, Britain had done enough \"self-isolation\" measures, in case of the possible transmission of COVID-19 in the UK. According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)' s plan for the evacuation of overseas Chinese, 83 British citizens in Wuhan had flown back to the UK on January 31 and been isolated for 14 days at a military base in Oxfordshire, UK [24] . Which confirmed that the infection-control procedures in the UK are advanced. Besides, Australia had also implemented many measures, including denied the people who had left or transited through mainland China gets into Australia, to slow the spread of COVID-19 into Australia and to prepare health care laboratories and services for a timely response [25] . However, as of the 24 th February 2020, the number of patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Canada (10 cases) was lower than in the USA (35 cases), the UK (13 cases) and Australia (22 cases) [9] . This may be an explanation of why the public response time in Canada was longer, and the duration of public attention was shorter than that in the USA, the UK and Australia. In addition, since the first reported case of COVID-19 in Canada, presenting as mild pneumonia, which may, to some extent, reduce the public' s vigilance to this newly virus [26] . Besides, according to previous research in China, the average duration of netizens' attention to social events is around 21 days [27] . Since the outbreak of COVID-19 meets the criteria for a PHEC, the duration of public attention toward ARS-CoV-2 should be longer. However, the duration of public attention in the countries contained in our study was not very long, particularly in Ireland and New Zealand. During the earlier period of observing time, all the countries contained in our study did not present too much attention to COVID-19, which may contribute to the global outbreak of COVID-19 in recent days. Which reminds us that when facing public health emergencies, governments should strengthen the publicity of these issues, shorten the response time to deal with major emergencies, improve the public' s vigilance and sensitivity, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, so as to minimize the loss of the masses.",

According to the WHO' s report that most people confirmed with COVID-19 in other countries had the history of traveling in Wuhan, China. Therefore, the development of tourism in different sub-regions may also affect the public awareness of COVID-19. Besides, according to a previous study' s report, as of 8 February 2020, the confirmed cases in Australia were found in New South Wales (4 cases), Victoria (4 cases), Queensland (5 cases) and Southern Australia (2 cases) [25] . The public in all the regions presented a higher interest in the topic regarding SARS-CoV-2. So, the confirmed cases within the regions may also affect our results. However, further studies are required to confirm these hypotheses. Since the distribution of the public with a higher awareness of COVID-19 was centralized, people in other places did not pay enough attention to COVID-19. Therefore, governments in all countries are required to strengthen the propaganda of COVID-19 nationally, so as to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 globally.",

People in the United States, the UK, and Australia responded faster toward COVID-19 due to the effective propaganda methods taken in these countries. Nevertheless, the duration of public attention in all the countries from both hemispheres contained in our study was not very long, especially in Ireland and New Zealand. The correlation between RSV related to COVID-19 with the daily number of confirmed cases in China and the total daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in other countries (besides China) was slight positively correlated. This suggests that public awareness of COVID-19 was not strong enough. Thus, more effective measures should be taken in these countries to strengthen the propaganda of COVID-19 to enhance public awareness and finally control the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.",
