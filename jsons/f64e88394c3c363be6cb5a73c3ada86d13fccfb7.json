The frontal prominence forms during the 4th postovulatory week and gives rise to the superior and middle portions of the face. The maxillary and nasal swellings form beneath the frontal prominence. At the end of the 4th week, two surface thickenings of the nasal swellings form the nasal placodes, which are of ectodermal origin and give rise to the epithelial lining of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The placodes invaginate, producing the nasal pits that become the anterior nares (nostrils) and, more deeply, the primitive posterior choanae. The medial nasal and frontal processes give rise to the nasal septum, frontal bones, nasal bones, ethmoid sinus complexes, and upper incisors. The lateral nasal and maxillary processes fuse to form the philtrum and columella. The cartilaginous nasal capsule forms deep to the nasal and frontal bones from the chondrocranium (skull base) during the 7th and 8th postovulatory weeks. The paranasal sinuses develop from the lateral nasal walls at the sixth fetal week, and their growth continues after birth, throughout childhood and adolescence. The maxillary sinus is the first to develop, starting approximately at the 70th day of gestation from the lateral wall of the nasal cavities. The frontal sinuses derive from the region of the frontal recess of the nose, and the ethmoid sinuses originate as multiple separate evaginations from the nasal cavities, while the sphenoid sinuses take origin as evaginations from the posterior nasal capsule reaching the sphenoid bone.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 101, "end": 104, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Embryology"}, {"text": "The nasal cavities are separated by the nasal septum and limited by a roof which is centrally formed by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid (horizontal part), anteriorly by the frontal and nasal bones, and posteriorly by the body of the sphenoid.

The nasolacrimal duct opens in the inferior meatus, whereas the middle meatus receives drainage from the frontal, anterior ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses.

This pattern approach is a valuable complement of the initial scheme proposed by Hyams et al. [114] to grade ONB in four groups (Table 2 .7). The low-grade pattern comprises grades I-II of Hyams and the high-grade pattern grades III-IV. The low-grade pattern is seen most often, and it presents lobular arrangements with well-defined groups of tumor cells separated by abundant edematous and variably vascularized stroma (Fig. 2.80) . Prominent vascularization may cause bleeding at the time of biopsy. The neoplastic neuroblasts are typically small, showing round to oval nuclei with stippled chromatin, absent or small nucleoli, and minimal cytoplasm; occasionally clear cell type cytoplasms may be found. Neuroblasts are commonly separated by a neurofibrillary matrix formed by neuronal cell processes, in which axons may be demonstrable (Fig. 2.81 ). This background, seen in about 85 % of ONB, is the most helpful diagnostic feature. Homer Wright pseu-dorosettes are quite characteristic of ONB; however, they are less commonly seen. They form when the tumor cells surround the neurofibrillary matrix in collar-like arrangements. Perivascular pseudorosettes, formed by tumor cells arranged around capillaries, are of no diagnostic value, for they may be found in several types of neoplasms. Less frequently seen is the high-grade pattern of ONB, in which the tumor grows as diffuse sheets of cells with presence of foci of necrosis and scanty but highly vascular stroma (Fig. 2.82 ). True olfactory Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes are only seen in grade III ONBs; this uncommon type of rosettes depicts well-defined lumina lined by columnar cells resembling olfactory epithelium.

Grade IV ONBs are anaplastic tumors and usually show pleomorphic nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, increased mitotic rate, and conspicuous necrosis [427] .
