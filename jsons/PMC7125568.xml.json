            "text": "Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) offers new opportunities for the treatment of lung diseases such as lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Effective delivery of the siRNA to the site of action is hindered by many biological barriers i.e. bifurcations in the lung, mucociliary clearance, lung surfactant etc. [1], [2]. Once across these barriers, a number of additional factors have to be taken into consideration. SiRNA is quickly inactivated by RNases and macrophages. Hence, siRNA has been condensed or encapsulated with non-viral siRNA carriers to afford its protection against host defences. The requirements for efficient lung deposition are generally defined as appropriate aerodynamic mean diameter of droplets or dry powders in the range of 1\u20135 \u00b5m [3], and sufficient stability of carriers to allow nebulization [4]. Once deposited in the lung, siRNA complex sizes should have a particle diameter less than 200 nm to avoid macrophage phagocytosis [5], [6].",

SiRNA polyplexes formed with biodegradable poly(amino ester glycol urethane) were shown to display low cytotoxicity. Combined with a fast siRNA release, these siRNA polyplexes lead to efficient gene silencing in vitro\n[12]. Recent studies reported chitosan as a potential carrier for siRNA delivery, however none of them investigated the degradation in correlation with siRNA release and knockdown efficiency [13], [14], [15]. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were most frequently used for encapsulation of peptides, proteins and pDNA. The breakdown of PLGA leads to acidic degradation products, lactic and glycolic acid, which can cause DNA degradation and damage [16]. These nanoparticles were not able to mediate pronounced DNA transfection efficiency possibly due to poor encapsulation, low cellular uptake, insufficient lysosomal escape, or as previously mentioned, DNA degradation [17].",

In this study we focused on a derivative of poly(vinyl 3-(dialkylamino) alkylcarbamate-co-vinyl acetate-co-vinyl alcohol)-graft-poly-(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) containing diethylaminopropylamine (DEAPA) as amine function with composition DEAPA(68)\u2013PVA\u2013PLGA (1:10), abbreviated as P(68)-10. [19]. This polymer was found to be useful for pDNA containing nanoparticles [20] showing surprisingly high transfection efficiencies. The mechanism of transfection does not rely on the proton-sponge effect of the backbone [21] but rather on the rapid degradation rates. The biocompatibility of P(68)-10 was found to be superior to poly(ethylene imine) [22] and the acute toxicity and inflammatory response of P(68)-10 nanoparticles after pulmonary application was comparatively low [23]. The degradation rates and profiles are affected by the polymer structure and very rapid degradation rates can be achieved [24].",

Solvent displacement also allowed the scale of the nanoparticle formation to be modified from large batch sizes to small volumes such as 50 \u00b5l siRNA nanoparticles.

For high knockdown efficiency, siRNA formulations should be stable during cellular uptake but release siRNA in the cytosol, where it can bind to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and exert its biological activity [37]. To investigate the electrostatic interaction of the P(68)-10 and siRNA, a heparin competition assay was performed. PEI 25 kDa as a typical example for polyplexes and Lipofectamine for lipoplexes were included for comparison. In accordance with the low knockdown efficiency of PEI 25 kDa in H1299 luc cells, PEI displayed a strong electrostatic RNA binding. To release 30% of siRNA from PEI polyplexes, 0.5 IU heparin were required, and at least 1 IU heparin was necessary to release 70% of siRNA, as shown in Fig. 4\n. By contrast, P(68)-10/siRNA nanoparticles formed sufficiently stable nano-carriers for nebulization and endocytotic uptake (see in vitro biological activity) but the electrostatic binding was not as high, allowing sufficient release of siRNA in buffer and possibly in the cytoplasm. Only 0.05 IU heparin were necessary to release 30% of siRNA from the nanoparticles, and 0.5 IU heparin to release 70% siRNA. The much smaller binding affinity of P(68)-10 polymer was due to the type and density of the amine present. The tertiary dimethyl amine incorporated into P(68)-10 will be less protonated than the PEI primary amines [38] and therefore have less electrostatic affinity with the phosphate groups of siRNA. In comparison to PEI, the amine density is also about 50 times less, with 2500 Da/amine for P(68)-10 versus 43 Da/amine for PEI. These two properties combined ensure that the siRNA is weakly bound within the P(68)-10 nanoparticle, and upon P(68)-10 degradation, the siRNA is able to free itself from the degradation by-products. In the case of Lipofectamine, no siRNA could be released from the lipoplexes with heparin. However, recent studies showed that lipoplexes decomplex more easily than polyplexes, which can be explained by their fusogenic properties with cell membranes leading to the release of the siRNA [39].",

            "text": "As mentioned above biodegradability is a key factor for long-term pulmonary application to avoid side-effects caused by accumulation [39], [40], [41]. The first breakthrough in pulmonary drug delivery was achieved with PLGA microparticles [42], due to their low toxicity and biodegradable character. The drawback of the PLGA microparticles was their slow degradation rate, which could vary from weeks to months. Wittmar et al. therefore synthesized a new class of DEAPA\u2013PVA\u2013PLGA polymers with a much faster degradation rate, by introducing hydrophilic amine groups [24]. To study the degradation profile of P(68)-10/siRNA nanoparticles under physiological conditions, static light scattering was used. The degradation of the P(68)-10 nanoparticles particles was shown to be dependent on the pH. Solutions of 0. 1% poloxamer (pH 5.2, Fig. 2B) and 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.5, data not shown) both displayed t\n1/2 of > 1000 min. At physiological pH, degradation of the nanoparticles was complete in less than 300 min at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffered saline with a t\n1/2 of 76 min as seen in Fig. 5\n. In accordance to the results obtained by static light scattering, siRNA release studies in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 showed a 40% release during the first 2 h. After 4 h incubation a nearly complete release is achieved with 80% free siRNA. This rapid rate of siRNA release, correlated to the degradation of the siRNA carrier, has not been demonstrated for other siRNA carriers to our knowledge. A similar behaviour was shown by Tseng et al. with the formulations of biodegradable poly(amino ester glycol urethane)/siRNA polyplexes. They could show a maximum siRNA release after 14 h incubation in PBS pH 7.4 [12]. The rapid biodegradability does not only have a positive effect on biocompatibility but most likely contributes to a rapid release of the siRNA inside the cytosol after endocytotic escape. Whereas in the acidic endosome (pH 5.0\u20135.5), there would be little to no degradation, and the siRNA would remain protected and encapsulated. Exactly how the P(68)-10/siRNA nanoparticles escape from the lysosome remains to be investigated in more detail. While lipoplexes are known to escape from endosomes by a fusion mechanism with the cell membrane [43], cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) are thought to be released from endosomes by the so-called proton-sponge effect [44] and possibly local membrane damage [45]. Presently the escape mechanism of P(68)-10/siRNA nanoparticles is not known and remains to be determined in separate studies but we speculate that not only osmotic effects but also interactions with the endosomal membrane could play a role. This interaction would disrupt the membrane potential generated by membrane bound ATPases, and keep the pH near the extracellular and cytosol pH, where the degradation P(68)-10/siRNA is rapid and subsequent release of siRNA would find its way into the cytosol. Further studies are under way to clarify the mechanistic aspects of siRNA delivery using P(68) nanoparticles.",

Known as a highly efficient standard transfection reagent for pDNA, it displayed less promising gene silencing in the case of siRNA. Strong electrostatic interactions with siRNA were shown using the Heparin Binding Assay and likely results in low knockdown efficiency due to incomplete siRNA release into the cytosol. The design of the P(68)-10/siRNA formulation allows for a more favourable release of siRNA, due to a number of factors. A highly positive surface charge of 15\u201320 mV ensures the binding of the nanoparticles to the negatively charged cell membrane, where uptake can take place. Once inside the endosomes, interaction of the positively charged hydrophobic nanoparticles with the endosomal membrane, in a similar way as it has been hypothesized for PEI [45], would lead to destabilization and local membrane damages. Water influx followed by neutralization of the acidic lysosomal environment would cause hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation of the PLGA chains into its by-products. As a result the osmotic pressure increases, thereby leading to further water influx and ultimate rupture of the endosomes [47]. In the cytosol (pH 7.4) degradation of the P(68)-10/siRNA nanoparticles is fast and subsequent release of the siRNA can occur. Rapid uptake and endo-lysosomal release in less than 10 min is also seen with PLGA nanoparticles [48]. These factors most likely contribute to the high luciferase knockdown seen with the small siRNA dosages of 5 and 10 pmol.",

This was also seen in the transfection of siRNA. Fig. 8\ndisplays the results of two N:P ratios, 6:1 and 10:1, that were tested for effects after nebulization and condensation. For the non-specific siRNA, no effects are seen for either N:P ratio or siRNA dosage. From this data, it can be concluded that nebulization had no effect on the cytotoxicity properties of the nanoparticle suspensions. For the 6:1 N:P ratio, nebulization caused a significant decrease in both the 5 and 10 pmol siRNA dosages (unpaired Student's t-test). On average, there was a 20% increase in luciferase knockdown activity after nebulization for the 6:1 N:P ratio. A cause for the decreased siRNA transfection observed after nebulization for the 6:1 N:P ratio might be linked by the results seen for the particle sizes. After nebulization the mean particle size increased from 157 nm to 215 nm. The increase in size of the nanoparticle suspension should not make much difference, as the 15:1 N:P ratio has a similar particle size of 200\u2013210 nm and transfection results were not affected after nebulization (data not shown). Instead, the vibrating energy of the nebulizer may have a more disruptive behaviour for the smaller 6:1 N:P, due to the smaller particle sizes, the increased proportion of siRNA it is carrying, or both. This disruptive effect possibly leads to less siRNA encapsulated or nanoparticles that degrades faster than observed, and therefore less siRNA delivered to the H1299 luc cells.",

            "text": "The design and formulation of siRNA carriers for gene therapy in the last few years have led to a broad panel of various liposomal and cationic polymer vectors. Liposome-mediated delivery showed efficient knockdown in vitro but were inefficient when applied in vivo via instillation [7]. Among the polymeric vectors, derivatives of PEI such as degradable oligo-ethylenimine, pegylated PEI and low molecular weight fraction of PEI have been used as siRNA carriers [8], [49], [50]. These siRNA carriers and others have slowly elucidated what is necessary for an ideal carrier. An ideal siRNA carrier for aerosol gene therapy needs to meet the following requirements: i) protection of the siRNA against high shear forces during nanoparticle formation and nebulization ii) fast degradation rate into non-toxic by-products at the target site iii) release of siRNA into the cytosol for effective gene silencing. The design of the branched polyester, consisting of an amine-modified PVA backbone grafted with PLGA chains, was tested to see if this polymer could meet the requirements needed for use as a siRNA carrier. SiRNA was shown to be encapsulated or absorbed with greater than 90% efficiency into the nanoparticles. The encapsulated siRNA was protected and remained intact during nanoparticle formation and after nebulization. Particle size and transfection results both demonstrate that the anti-luc siRNA remained active against luciferase as long as N:P ratios of at or above 10:1 were formulated. Breakdown of the nanoparticles within 4 h, shown by static light scattering, leads to a rapid release of the siRNA. Though this could be challenging for in vivo gene delivery as most physiological fluids are also within this rapid degradation pH range, the high surface potential of the P(68)-10/siRNA nanoparticles makes it likely that it will be taken into the lung cells quickly upon aerosol deposition. Nebulization of the nanoparticle suspension had only minor effects on the in vitro biological activity at the lowest N:P ratio of 6:1. This issue could be easily overcome with an increase in the N:P ratio. At an N:P ratio of 10:1 the nebulized P(68)-10/siRNA nanoparticles displayed comparable knockdown efficiency to the non-nebulized samples. Only small siRNA dosages of 5 and 10 pmol were necessary to achieve a luciferase knockdown of 80\u201390% with minor to no cytotoxicity. The combined features of fast degradation combined with low cytotoxicity, nanoparticle stability during nebulization, and high specific knockdown make the P(68)-10 polymer a promising siRNA carrier for pulmonary gene therapy and future in vivo studies.",
