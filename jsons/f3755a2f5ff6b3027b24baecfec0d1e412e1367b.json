The situation is quite different for non-homogeneous datasets. As an example, we generated a set of trees \u03a4 with ! R equal to 0.6 and 0.85 for the first and second halves, respectively. The results are presented in Fig. 2(b superior. For small sizes of \u03a4 (c.f. Fig. 2(c) ), average estimates of ! ! R a,b display strong fluctuations. Starting with ~50 trees per dataset , ! R estimates are neater. With further increasing the size of \u03a4 , ! R estimates are more grouped around the exact values and the error bars (95% CI) are smaller.",
