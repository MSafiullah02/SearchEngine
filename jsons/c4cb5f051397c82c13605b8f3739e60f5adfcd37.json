            "text": "Background: Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as PCR, are preferred for respiratory virus testing, due to superior diagnostic accuracy and faster turnaround time. Panther Fusion\u00ae Respiratory Assays (Fusion), which includes FluA/B/RSV (FFABR), Paraflu and AdV/hMPV/RV, offers a modular approach to syndromic testing on a fully automated platform while improving gene targets and expanding the test menu. Objectives and study design: We evaluated Fusion using 275 consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens previously used in an analysis of five PCRs, as well as 225 archived specimens. Results: Of the combined 500 specimens, 134 were positive for influenza A (FluA), 54 for FluB, 65 for RSV, 64 for parainfluenza (PIV), 24 for adenovirus (AdV), 21 for humanmetapneumovirus (hMPV), and 40 for rhinovirus (RV) with Fusion. Of the positive samples Fusion correlated with historical results for all but one, despite multiple freeze-thaws cycles of this collection. Fusion was positive for an additional 33 samples, including 11 FluAs, 7 RSVs, 3 PIV3s, 3 AdV, 6 hMPV and 3 RVs. These samples were retested with corresponding Prodesse (Pro) assays using quadruple sample volume. This resolver test confirmed Fusion results for an additional 4 FluAs, 4 RSVs, 1 PIV3 and 3 AdVs. The sensitivity and specificity ranges of Fusion were 99-100% and 98-100%. Limit of detection (LOD) analyses were performed on a variety of Flu isolates. The LODs ranged from 2.69 to 2.99 log copies/ml and demonstrated superior LOD as compared to previously published data for some assays or to concurrent analyses with two new commercial tests.",

However, performance differences have been observed among commercial NAATs, particularly after 2014 when sequence divergence in the matrix gene of A(H3N2) viruses emerged [5] [6] [7] . Especially problematic was a C163 T mutation that was first observed among 3C.2a clades of A(H3N2) [8] [9] [10] . Commercial assays with significantly reduced sensitivities after the C163 T mutation emerged, included Prodesse ProFlu+ (PFlu) and Xpert\u00ae Flu (Xpt).",

The FluA component still targets the matrix gene, but it uses a dual target approach with multiple probes for added redundancy to help safeguard against genetic drift. Both FluB and RSV now target the matrix gene and the AdV hexon gene target is designed to detect all AdV genotypes. The gene targets for hMPV and PIV 4 are the nucleocapsid genes, while those for PIV [1] [2] [3] and RV are the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase region and the 5\u2032 UTR, respectively.

However, this study involved selected pediatric specimens collected over five respiratory virus seasons, as opposed to all specimens received within a period of high incidence, which is a better challenge of test sensitivity. In addition, pediatric cases are known to have higher viral titers, which also poses less of challenge with regards to test sensitivity.

There were 12 additional Fusion positive samples, which were confirmed true positive by analysis on Pro using higher sample input volumes. Indeed, the need for more sensitive methods for discrepancy analysis for Fusion has been demonstrated by others [20] . This leaves 21 samples not confirmed by a different method. It is not clear if this phenomenon is due to the greater analytic sensitivity of Fusion or due to true false viral detection. The superior analytical sensitivity was demonstrated in the LOD and endpoint dilution studies, in addition to the fact that the test performed exceptionally well with highly compromised samples in terms of specimen handling for maintaining viral RNA titers. Indeed, it appears the FP samples had much lower virus titers, as demonstrated by Ct values (Supplemental figure  1) ; hence, a system with superior analytical sensitivity would demonstrate better performance with such specimens. Furthermore, the additional positive viruses were only observed in samples collected during periods of high viral prevalence, for example during the 2-week period of 25% FluA incidence. False positive detection or signal would be a random event and be equally evident at periods of low viral incidence. It is also important to point out that 3 F P samples were due to RV and unfortunately, we only had one other system available in our lab to test for RV. Hence, there was no true referee of the difference in the two systems.",

However, the sensitives would decrease by 4 to 10%. It is also important to point out the choice of reference method in the absence of a gold standard has a significant impact on test performance. If this study involved submission of a diagnostic test to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a majority criteria would be required for a non-reference standard and a resolver test would not be allowed for the determination of positive and negative agreement, so as to prevent the introduction of bias in favor of the new test [21] .

Pro was chosen as the resolver because 1) it had LOD lower than any of the other commercial assays [10] and 2) it can be modified to increase the effective testing volume. Likewise, Sanger sequencing which is often used as a resolver, it doesn't have a low LOD. For example, HIV genotyping can only be performed on patients with viral loads of 1000 copies/ml.
