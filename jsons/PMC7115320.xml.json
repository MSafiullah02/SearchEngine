Persistent carriers were defined as individuals with both specimens positive with the same spa type, whereas those positive on 1 occasion were classified as transient carriers.

Environmental contamination from persistent carriers may also involve aerosols from these workers in addition to the usually considered nose-to-hand-to-environment transmission route. Reinforcement of handwashing also led to elimination of spa types from sources other than colonized coworkers. This indicates handwashing before commencement of work removes contamination from outside the workplace. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, hand hygiene has improved as a result of government initiatives, including appointment of hygiene supervisors to monitor handwashing. The overall low level of hand contamination we found was similar to the 9% reported for Finnish airline-catering workers11 and 8.4% reported for Spanish food handlers.3\n",
