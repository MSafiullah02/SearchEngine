Summary OBJECTIVES: Since January 23 rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult. METHODS: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases. RESULTS: Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing.

The number of daily illness onset cases grew exponentially before January 20 th 2020, and continued to grow but with a lower rate after January 20 th 2020. Then it increased with a constant rate since the growth looks like a straight line (Figure 3(B)). We used the data on cases with illness onset before January 4 th , basic reproduction number 0 , 21 which was 3.27 (95% confidence interval [2.98,3.58]). To investigate the variation of the basic reproduction number and its relationship with the serial interval, sensitivity analysis is carried out by changing the mean of the serial interval from 3 to 12 days. We examine the variation in 0 with the serial interval(Figure 3(C)). The basic reproduction number 0 increases in parallel with the serial interval. According to recent papers,22,23 the serial interval may be shorter than that estimated in the previous references. The mean of median serial interval was estimated to range from 3 to 6 days, the corresponding value of estimated 0 is between 1.45 and 2.43(Figure 3(C)).Further we use the number of cases with illness onset on day t in China,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "B) there was a small peak around January 12 th 2020 which induces a relatively small and late main peak in Hubei, compared to Figure 4(A).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF9": {"text": "quarantined/suspected cases peak earlier than the number of reported cases. Increasing the minimum contact rate leads to an increase in the cumulative number of reported cases, the cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases. An increase in individuals' movement C-D, G-H) increasing the detection rate by three times while halving the confirmation ratio will result in high cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases. In such a scenario, the number of cumulative reported cases exhibits a great decline, by comparingFigure 5(A) and(E),Figure 5(B) and (F)), i.e., the blue curves inFigure 5(E-F) stabilize at lower values than the black curves do, which means that increasing detection rate by four times, even decreasing the confirmation ratio by half, can lower down the final cumulative reported cases and bring forward the epidemic peak. Continuing to enhance the quarantine and isolation strategy, improving detection rate, decreasing the confirmation ratio, are beneficial for mitigating the burden of the infection.Repeating the above process based on real and generated data for Hubei gives similar results reported inFigure 6(there is no data on suspected cases in Hubei). FromFigure 6 (A-C) doubling the minimum contact rate leads to an increase in the cumulative number of reported, quarantined, and suspected cases. Similar to Figure 5(A-C), increasing the minimum contact rate induces a significant increase in the number of quarantined cases, comparing Figure 6(C) to C). More people may be quarantined if the contact rate becomes greater in Hubei. The important factors making the prediction difficult are the lag in cases reporting and the randomness of the monitoring data. To examine the randomness of multi-source data and their influence on model prediction, we assume the cumulative reported, death, suspected and cumulative quarantined cases follow a Poisson distribution with the intraday cumulative number as the key parameter, and we randomly generate 1000 columns of datasets for fitting. We then J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f obtain the mean value and 95% confidence interval of key indicators including epidemic situation, daily reproduction ratio, peak time or inflection point (Figure 7). Due to the characteristics of the cumulative data, we here only show the 95% of the unilateral upper confidence limit and interval in Figure 7. The number of cumulative quarantined cases tends to be stable while the other three types of cumulative population sizes exhibit great randomness, implying that a random event (such as a sudden cluster infection) may lead to a rapid increase in the numbers of cumulative reported cases, deaths and suspected cases. Moreover, the fitting curve of the cumulative death cases with the real data is located in the middle of 95% unilateral upper confidence interval. The number of cumulative death cases due to the COVID-19 infection is highly uncertain where the improvement of treatment level may significantly reduce the fatality rate. Similarly, on the basis of real data and 1000 columns of generated data we plot the curve of hospital notifications, (Figure 8(A) for China and (D) for Hubei). The hospital notifications will peak around February 8 th 2020, and the peak time for the Hubei province may be one day early. The values of the hospital notifications in Figure 8 (A) and (D) are much smaller than those reported by the National Health Commission of China, 11 due to the very restrictive discharge conditions in Hubei. From Figure 8 (B) and (E), the estimated effective reproduction number based on the real data almost coincides with the mean values for both China and Hubei, while the effective reproduction number in the Hubei province is always larger than that the value for mainland China. From Figure 8(A) and Figure 8(B), the COVID-19 epidemics in China is highly uncertain. Figure 8(C) and (F) give the estimated contact rate c(t), quarantined rate q(t) and diagnose rate ( ), showing that the contact rate curve for Hubei decreases faster than that for mainland China with a smaller . The quick decrease of the contact rate, the gradual increase of quarantined diagnosed cases rates indicate that the restrictive measures in China have been strengthened since January 23 rd 2020. Discussion Since January 23 rd 2020 the Chinese government has implemented several measures. Recent data show that most of reported cases come from suspected individuals. This implies that the changing trends of cumulative quarantined and suspected cases greatly influence the trend of the COVID-19 epidemics. The cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly tend to stabilize, since their inflection points have already been achieved. The COVID-19 epidemics will peak in the near future. The existing models either use the data of only confirmed cases or data of both confirmed and death cases, with most of model predictions ignoring the effects of quarantine and isolation. Here we extend a previously developed model ,9 by including new compartments, and utilizing more data of quarantined and suspected cases, to make predictions and perform assessment and risk analysis. Based on our prediction, the number of cumulative confirmed cases is near to its inflection point and the COVID-19 infection will peak soon. The trend of the COVID-19 epidemics in Hubei and China depends on cumulative quarantined and suspected cases, in terms of variations of detection rate and the confirmation ratio for these two compartments. Therefore, our model is consistent with the current epidemics development and in line with the prevention measures implemented in mainland China. The effective reproduction numbers are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f quite large before January 24 th 2020, suggesting that the population movement before the Spring Festival, especially the outflow of the population before the lock-down of Wuhan, has been an important factor resulting in the COVID-19 epidemics. The effective reproduction numbers show a declining trend, meaning that new infections have largely been decreasing, while new reported cases have been increasing significantly during February 3 rd to February 7 th 2020. Most cases were quarantined or became suspected cases. The strong measures implemented have reduced the effective reproduction number. These interventions may take a longer time to be effective as the second and third generations of infected people are exposed in succession. After the first wave of the Spring festival, the flow of people increased the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus. The uncertainty of the national epidemics is higher than that of Hubei, so the evolutionary trend of the epidemics still needs attention in the future in terms of population migration or possible infection clusters on the way.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF11": {"text": "Diagram of the model adopted in the study for simulating the COVID-19 infection.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF12": {"text": "(A) Cumulative number of confirmed reported cases for mainland China, Hubei province and Wuhan city, (B) Estimated number of illness onset cases for mainland China, Hubei province and Wuhan city, (C) Estimated basic reproduction number 0", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF13": {"text": "Estimated effective reproduction number R t for mainland China in (A) and for Hubei province in (B).
