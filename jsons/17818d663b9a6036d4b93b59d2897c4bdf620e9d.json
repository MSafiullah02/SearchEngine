In two striking studies, Karakus et al. and Giotis et al. identified major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) as a receptor for bat H17N10 and H18N11 viruses [6, 7] . Karakus et al. used transcriptomic profiling and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening of susceptible and non-susceptible cells to identify and characterize MHCII as an entry determinant for bat H17N10 and H18N11 viruses [6] . The authors also observed that bat H17N10 and H18N11 viruses could initiate virus entry via MHCII homologs encoded by multiple bat species, pigs, humans and chickens [6] . In a subsequent study, Giotis et The use of MHCII as a receptor is unique to bat H17N10 and H18N11 influenza viruses, which might suggest altered cellular tropism relative to other known IAVs. In bats, H17N10 RNA was detected in liver, kidney, lung and intestinal tissues, whereas H18N11 RNA was found exclusively in the intestine [1] . Ciminski et al. indeed demonstrated that in bats experimentally infected with H18N11, virus could be detected in the feces and transmitted to co-housed na\u00efve bats, presumably via the fecal-oral route [8] . This is akin to the behavior of avian influenza viruses in waterfowl. Going forward, it will be important to determine with greater resolution the specific cell types that are permissive for replication of H17N10 and H18N11 viruses in bats. in response to infection [8] . Nevertheless, it will be interesting to determine whether H18N11 infection impairs T cell activation and as a result, the breadth and quality of the antibody response ( Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "be essential for understanding the co-evolutionary relationship of the virus with these hosts. The discovery of MHCII as a receptor for bat influenza viruses also raises several important questions about the consequences of immune cell susceptibility in terms of both viral pathogenicity and host range. The fact that viruses pseudotyped with bat influenza virus HAs could infect avian and human cells raised concerns regarding the potential for epizootic and zoonotic transmissions. Giotis et al. and Karakus et al.'s studies using viruses pseudotyped with bat H17 and H18 demonstrated that bat IAVs have broad tropism. In humans, certain cells of the immune system, as well as epithelial cells in human lungs and intestine constitutively express MHCII. However, it remained unclear whether wildtype bat IAVs were able to replicate and transmit in species other than bats. A recent study by Ciminski et al. has provided important insight into this critical question. Using wildtype and cell-culture adapted H18N11, the authors performed in vivo replication and transmission studies in mice, ferrets and bats. These viruses were produced from infectious clones since, as of yet, there are no natural isolates. Serial passage of wild type (WT) H18N11 in canine RIE1495 cells selected for adaptive mutations in the viral HA (S235Y or V254F) and deletions of the neuraminidase (NA) ectodomain [8]. Experimental infection of mice with H18N11 also selected for adaptive mutations in HA and deletion mutations in NA. Virus replication was limited to the upper respiratory tract and infected mice were unable to transmit the virus to na\u00efve contact mice. Ferrets are considered to be the \"gold standard\" model for studies of influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission. In these animals, a recombinant cell culture adapted bat virus (rP11), which contains adaptive mutations in HA and a stop codon in the stalk of NA that results in deletion of the ectodomain, replicated in multiple organs, including conchae, lung, cerebrum and cerebellum. However, the virus was not shed or transmitted to na\u00efve contact ferrets. Interestingly, upon passaging of rP11 in ferrets, a single point mutation restored the N11 open-reading frame, suggesting that it may have functional relevance. Yet, viral transcripts could not be detected in nasal lavage of ferrets infected with WT H18N11 [8].The rP11 virus also contained K170R and N250S mutations in HA which were shown to enhance infectivity in mammalian cells in vitro. These mutations were maintained in rP11 after passage in ferrets when the mutation restoring NA expression emerged. NA expression was also required for efficient transmission in bats. Infection of Artibeus jamaicensis bats (a close relative of Artibeus planirostris, the species from which H18N11 was initially characterized) with rP11 also resulted in restoration of the full length N11 coding sequence collected from both index and contact animals. Therefore, while full-length N11 does not appear to be required for replication and shedding, it is likely necessary to facilitate efficient transmission in bats.Ciminski et al.    demonstrated that ectopically expressed N11 reduced surface expression of MHCII. They speculated that this might facilitate progeny virus egress, just as cleavage of sialic acid facilitates egress of other IAVs[8]. However, the ability to downregulate MHCII has implications for adaptive immune responses against bat influenza viruses and may contribute to viral pathogenesis.MHCII is responsible for presenting antigen to CD4+ T cells, which, along with co-stimulatory factors, promotes their activation[9]. CD4+ T cells are then essential for promoting high-quality antibody responses by providing B cells with the signals required to induce somatic maturation. Ciminski et al. reported seroconversion of bats after experimental infection with WT H18N11, demonstrating that antibody responses are generated",

(A) MHCII-mediated antigen presentation in , along with other co-stimulatory signals play a critical role in CD4+ T cell activation. Activated CD4+ T cells produce cytokines that prime a strong humoral response against invading viruses. (B) Bat influenza viruses use MHCII as a cellular receptor. These viruses are known to infect epithelial cells. However, it is unclear whether they infect MHCIIexpressing antigen-presenting cells. (C) Ciminski et al. demonstrated that N11 reduced surface expression of MHCII. (D) While this is likely to facilitate virus egress from infected cells, it might in turn reduce CD4+ T cell activationespecially if it occurs in antigen-presenting cells. This could have deleterious effects on the host adaptive immune response, (E) including the priming of humoral antiviral response. Further studies are required to fully understand the role of N11 in downregulating host MHCII and discern the potential implications on the adaptive immune response, viral pathogenesis, and disease manifestation.",
