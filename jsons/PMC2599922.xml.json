Noting universal susceptibility, multiple independent importations, and an association with war, crowding, and the breakdown of public-health measures, Thucydides also distinguished between signs, symptoms, complications, and variant clinical courses, and presented attack and case-fatality rates. His compelling clinical, public-health, and societally contextual description of an emerging disease was studied by virtually all western and middle eastern medical students for centuries, and profoundly influenced concepts of, approaches to, and even terminology of emerging infections well into the 19th century.",

The hospital bed linens of Parisian patients were initially burned. Soon, victims were turned away entirely; then they were given 24 h to isolate themselves or leave the city on pain of death by hanging. Charlatans with quack remedies, often painful and deadly, appeared everywhere to treat desperate and dying victims. Nothing worked.

Its early recognition in a peripatetic airline steward suggested (only partly correctly) that its emergence might have resulted from increased human movement resulting from ever decreasing travel times to multiple destinations.84 Moreover, rapid spread via blood and body fluids within risk groups most capable of supporting such transmission (men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and transfusion recipients) seemed to support recent emergence. Surprisingly, however, phylogenetic analyses of the virus suggest that HIV infection emerged as a human disease around 1900,85 and by complex pathways. Multiple jumps, into chimpanzees, of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains restricted to different primate species,86 were apparently followed by SIV genetic recombinations that produced new chimpanzee-adapted SIVs. It is likely that three of these recombinants then transferred independently into human beings, leading to parallel HIV emergences now represented by different HIV clades.85\n",
