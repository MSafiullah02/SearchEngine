However, early adaption of Big Data in other fields revealed ethical challenges that could undermine privacy and autonomy of individuals and cause stigmatization. This chapter aims to identify the benefits and risks associated with the public health application of Big Data through ethical lenses. In doing so, it highlights the need for ethical discussion and framework towards an effective utilization of technologies. We then discuss key strategies to mitigate potentially harmful aspects of Big Data to facilitate its safe and effective implementation.",

Voluntary measures include preventive programs such as vaccination, educational campaigns for promoting healthy lifestyle, and nutrition supplementation to economically disadvantaged populations. Because health and health-related behaviors of populations can be highly influenced by environmental factors such as air pollution, green space, retail food environment, and hygiene, public health agencies are also responsible for improving the living environment [2] . An equally important role of public health is the surveillance of population health status, which encompasses spatiotemporal distribution of disease outcomes, behavioral risk factors, and physical and social environment affecting health. As a backbone of public health activities, surveillance provides critical insights in population health status to guide the development, management, and evaluation of interventions. As well, surveillance has a critical role in identifying of health needs among disadvantaged populations, thereby assisting the development of equitable health interventions.",

Noncommunicable diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, are now responsible for the majority of global death and disability [4] , which placed increasing importance on the monitoring and preventive interventions for lifestyle risk factors such as diet, physical activities, and tobacco use. Socioeconomic and demographic inequality in health remains an important public health problem requiring the development and evaluation of equitable intervention reaching to underprivileged individuals. Other critical public health mandates include prevention and surveillance of injuries, assessment of healthcare performance, improvement of maternal and infant health, and disaster response. Furthermore, health of public is threatened by the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases [5, 6] and constantly emerging infectious diseases with significant national and global health consequence, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), West Nile Virus, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza, and more recently the epidemic of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the West Africa [7] .

In effect, participatory surveillance offers a potential to create a mutual collaboration between public health agencies and citizen sentinel who submits local information and in return receives relevant information to their context. This is contrary to the current use of online data by commercial industries, where the users' data is routinely sold and/or analyzed by service providers (although aggregated or anonymized), and the profit from inferred/discovered knowledge is not shared with the Internet users, while the users suffer from privacy intrusion [23] .",

Tracking online customer activities (often secretly to users) became industry-wide practice. Personally, identifiable data is routinely collected, centralized, and permanently stored by search engines and social networking sites (SNS) and undergoes mass disclosure (i.e., sold to their parties) without users' permission and even awareness [66] . Such data is in turn used to predict personally sensitive attributes including sexual orientation, political view, parental separation [21, 67] and to generate personalized advertisement aimed at driving consumer preference and decision [68] . In addition, widespread sharing of personal information on the Internet poses a unique challenge in defining online privacy [69, 70] . Users self-disclosing personal information in SNS or blogs typically expect their messages to be exposed to the online world. However, it does not imply that the data is subject to amassing and indiscriminate use, as such activities can lead to reidentification and potential harm to the users [70] , which certainly conflict with the users' expectation [69] . Individuals who are affected by stigmatizing illness particularly express concerns with the unintended use of their data by third parties [71] . Despite the public nature of social media, privacy does exist as a right to prevent data usage that leads to stigmatization, restriction of liberty, and violation of privacy. Some users publish their health and non-health information openly due to the sheer lack of privacy concerns and awareness. Such users are unlikely to be familiar with the contents of the privacy policies and statements in social media, which may state the usage of personal information by third parties. Even if users attempt to read privacy statements, inconsistency and complexity of privacy settings and policies in ever-growing social media applications make controlling of personal information far from trivial [72] [73] [74] . Yet, the legitimacy of these policies without users' explicit understanding in terms of risks and benefits is highly questionable. Therefore, sharing of sensitive information in the online environment does not necessarily equate to consent for data usage. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the data usage policies in these websites encompass public health surveillance. Although public health agencies are exempt from obtaining consent for secondary use of patient health records, such action is justifiable only in the presence of clear and immediate public health risk [11] .",

Unlike screening test which are typically performed with informed participation, predictive algorithms can secretly profile millions of social media users without awareness of those who are targeted. Accidental or intentional disclosure of their predicted disease status can affect socioeconomic status including employment and insurance, whereas prediction of highly personal characteristic such as sexual orientation can be intrinsically offending. Excessive use of predictive algorithms to generate a large repository of sensitive characteristics can be highly concerning. It is therefore challenging for individuals to escape from the privacy assault from prediction and resist presumptive activities and automatic profiling by the government [79, 80] especially in the face of automatic data collection by ubiquitous sensor devices (e.g., including mobile smart phones), with their often opt-out nature of data submission.",

Simply focusing on unidirectional communications ignoring the interactivity, tailoring, and peer engagement is likely to add little value over traditional communication channels. Efforts should be allocated towards leveraging the user-centric features of participatory applications to meet heterogeneous needs of population subgroups, and the tailored messaging should encourage informed decision-making for people with varying language, cultural background, disability, health and technological literacy and numeracy [101] [102] [103] .
