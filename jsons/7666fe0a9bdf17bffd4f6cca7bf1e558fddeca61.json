            "text": "A group of biologists, ARTIC Network, has proposed a multiplexed PCR primer set for whole-genome analysis of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, soon after the start of COVID-19 epidemics was realized. The primer set was adapted by many researchers worldwide and has already contributed to the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this rapidly spreading viral disease. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set amplifies all desired 98 PCR amplicons with fairly small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we also observed an acute drop of reads derived from some amplicons especially amplicon 18 and 76 in \"pool 2\" as a sample's viral load decreases. We suspected this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers targeting those two amplicons. Indeed, replacement of just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, to a newly designed primer resulted in a drastic improvement of coverages at both regions targeted by the amplicons 18 and 76.",

We noticed that two of those primers, nCoV-2019_18_LEFT and nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT were perfectly complement to each other by their 10-nt sequence at the 3'-end (Fig 1) . From this observation, we reasoned that the rapid decrease of the amplification efficiencies of those amplicons was due to a primer dimer formation between nCoV-2019_18_LEFT and nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, that could compete to the amplification of desired targets. Indeed, we observed many NGS reads derived from the predicted dimer in raw FASTQ data (data not shown).",

The above result indicated that formation of primer dimers plays critical role in coverage bias in samples with low viral load. Given this observation, we detected additional six primer dimers (Fig 3) from raw NGS read data. The primers involved in these dimers were all included in the pool 1. Interestingly, the eight amplicons related to those primers (7, 9, 15, 21, 29, 45, 73 and 89) consistently showed relative low depth (Fig 2A and Fig S1, highlighted by red strips). Fig 2A) is shown in Fig 2B. Although using 35 PCR cycles resulted in better balanced yield of PCR product among samples with various viral loads compared to that with 30 cycles (Fig 4) , which eases multiplexing in NGS library construction, this increase in number of PCR cycles enlarged coverage bias overall regardless when original or new primer sets was used (Fig 2AB and Fig S1) . Nevertheless, improvement of coverages in the eight amplicons were seen with modified primer set ( Fig 2B and Fig S1, highlighted by red strips). ",

For such high viral load samples, all designated amplicons are amplified within acceptable level of coverage bias for subsequent NGS analysis. The approach of ARTIC Network is expected to save resources and scale to a number of samples with a given NGS sequencing capacity, which will be crucial for large epidemic situation being concerned in many countries. As sample's viral load decreases, however, gradual increase of the entire coverage bias was observed with their protocol. Although such phenomenon is normally expected in multiplexed PCR for low-copy templates, we observed that coverages for the two particular PCR amplicons, 18 and 76, which correspond to the genomic regions coding for the nsp3 in ORF1a and S protein, respectively, decays far more rapidly than other targets. In our experience so far, low to absolute-zero depth for those two amplicons tends to be most frequent bottle neck for completion of all targeted genomic regions from samples with middle",
