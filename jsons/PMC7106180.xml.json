RSV and influenza both have a peak incidence in winter and these peaks usually do not coincide but overlap. Parainfluenza virus (PIV) 3 usually peaks in winter with PIV 1 and PIV 2 peaking in autumn and early winter. The Picornaviridae cause infections all year round with enteroviruses more common in summer and autumn while rhinoviruses are more common in winter and spring. Adenoviruses tend to cause infections year round as do the Herpesviridae, except for varicella which is more prevalent in the late winter and early spring.",

Not all viruses grow in all cell types so clinical specimens are usually inoculated into several types of cells to provide an environment for the isolation of a suitable range of viruses. The use of a broad range of cell types potentially allows for the isolation of agents which are not expected rather than limiting detection to only a few virus types. This approach will also allow the detection of more than one virus in any given specimen which can occur in up to 5\u201310% of immunocompetent individuals and more frequently in immunocompromised patients especially with viruses which have latency such as CMV and HSV. Recently, commercially produced co-cultivated cryopreserved cells have become available for the rapid identification of viruses. R-Mix rapid cell culture (Diagnostic Hybrids) is a patented cell monolayer containing a mixture of A549 and mink lung (Mv1Lu) cells.3 After 24\u201372 h of culture, using pooled or single fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled monoclonal antibodies directed against influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza 1\u20133 and adenoviruses, rapid identification of a respiratory virus infection can be established.",

Decreasing the time until CPE is detectable has been achieved for many viruses by centrifugation of the culture after the sample has been added. As viruses are unable to be centrifuged with conventional centrifuges, the enhanced detection may result from better contact between cells in the specimen and the cell culture thus allowing for earlier and more extensive infection of the cell culture sheet. Furthermore, the detection of viral protein production (antigen detection) before there is evidence of CPE in conventional culture has also decreased the time to identify a virus and thus enhanced clinical utility of viral culture testing. The detection of viral protein production is usually performed using a fluorescent-labelled (e.g. FITC) monoclonal antibody directed against a viral protein. Processing and reading these cultures is labour intensive; however, most common viruses can be detected in 24\u201348 h. Alternatively enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection of viral proteins in cell culture supernatants has also been performed.",

HSV can be detected within 24 h of infection using chromogenic substrate which turns infected cells from colourless to blue.

These staining procedures are rapid: samples are batch run and results are usually available within 1\u20133 h depending on the number of specimens tested. Rapid immunofluorescent (IF) staining methods for the direct detection of viral antigens in respiratory specimens have excellent specificity and very good sensitivity. Most respiratory viruses produce CPE in conventional cell cultures but often this is slow or very minimal in extent. The rapid detection of the respiratory viruses influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1\u20133 and adenovirus by IF is available in many laboratories and is extremely useful for the detection of these viruses, especially in paediatric patients who shed relatively large amounts of virus and for a longer period than do adults. The performance characteristics of the test depend on the type of specimen, age of the patient, duration of illness, MAb reagent and level of expertise of the laboratory staff. Generally, IF methods for respiratory viruses are a little less sensitive than culture with the exception of RSV. However, the greater sensitivity of RSV IF compared with RSV culture is due to the lability of RSV which is rapidly inactivated in samples that are not kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory quickly for inoculation into cell cultures within a short period after collection of the specimen. The reported sensitivities of IF detection of respiratory viruses varies but are broadly 90% for RSV, 80% for influenza A and B, 70% for parainfluenza 1\u20133 and 50% for adenoviruses.6 MAbs directed against hMPV have been developed and are currently under investigation to establish their clinical utility.",

A significant aim of the manufacturers of these tests is to allow for testing to occur in the consulting physician's office. These techniques have the advantage of decreasing turn-around time for test results and have considerably simplified the technical component, but these tests are not as sensitive or specific as viral culture or direct IF (DIF) for detection of respiratory viruses. The positive predictive value of these assays is usually higher when there is a greater prevalence of disease in the respiratory virus season and the virus in question has been shown to be circulating in the community by viral culture or IF. During periods of relatively high prevalence positive results can usually be accepted as correct; however, negative results should be confirmed by a second method, e.g. DIF or culture.8\n",

Direct detection of viral antigen in respiratory specimens can also be performed and is the technique of choice for a rapid sensitive assay.

Very young infants may present with apnoeic episodes with minimal fever. Bacterial superinfection is a potential and serious complication of viral lower respiratory tract infection, particularly with influenza. Underlying cardiopulmonary disease such as valvular heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are well recognized risk factors for increased severity of disease with viral pneumonia.",

            "text": "Diagnosis of the specific cause of an acute pneumonia due to a particular viral agent is complicated by difficulty in obtaining appropriate lower respiratory tract samples for culture and in isolating or detecting certain pathogens, and additionally by the frequent asymptomatic shedding of some viruses, e.g. herpes simplex virus or adenoviruses. While viruses are clearly important and frequent causes of pneumonia in young children, they are less apparent in older children. RSV has been associated with the largest proportion of viral pneumonia in young children, particularly if accompanied by bronchiolitis.29 PIV 3 and influenza A and B are significant causes of pneumonia in children, especially during periods of epidemic prevalence.30 Adenoviruses are frequently isolated from children with respiratory disease and are implicated in about 10% of childhood pneumonias. However, their true impact is difficult to access because of the long intermittent asymptomatic respiratory shedding of adenoviruses in children. Adenoviruses have been described as cause of significant outbreaks of viral pneumonia in institutionalized children. Pneumonia is the most frequent serious complication of measles. Rhinoviruses have been associated with community-acquired pneumonia in children despite their apparent temperature sensitivity. Other occasional causes are enteroviruses, HSV and VSV.",
