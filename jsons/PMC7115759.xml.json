            "text": "Before we look at detailed accounts of events relating to the UK policy network, first we must consider what the key policy issues were relating to an anthropological response versus a purely clinical one. Anthropological literature exists, from previous outbreaks, documenting the cultural practices that affected the spread of Ebola (Hewlett and Hewlett, 2007). The main concerns relate to how local practices may accelerate the spread of the virus and the need to address these in order to lower infection rates. Ebola is highly contagious, particularly from contamination by bodily fluids. In West Africa, many local customs exist around burial practices that clinicians believe heighten the risk to communities. Common characteristics of these are, the washing of bodies by family members, passing clothing belonging to the deceased to family and the touching of the body (Richards, 2016). Another concern, as the crisis unfolded, was people attempting to provide home care to victims of the virus. The clinical response was to create isolation units or Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in which to assess and treat suspected cases (West & von Saint Andr\u00e9-von Arnim, 2014). Community based care centres were championed by the UK Government but their deployment came late and opinion was divided around their effectiveness. Clinicians regarded ETUs as an essential part of the response and wanted to educate people to discourage them from engaging in what they regarded as deeply unsafe practices, including home care (Walsh and Johnson, 2018) and (MSF, 2015).",

Anthropologist, Paul Richards, argues that agencies' and clinicians\u2019 lack of understanding of local customs worsened the crisis (Richards, 2016) and that far from being ignorant and needing rescuing from themselves, communities had coping strategies of their own. His studies from Sierra Leone and Liberia relate how some villages isolated themselves, created their own burial teams and successfully protected those who came in contact with suspected cases with makeshift protective garments (Richards, 2014a). Anthropologists working in West Africa during the epidemic prioritised studies of social mobilisation and community engagement and worked with communities directly on Ebola transmission. Sharon Abramowitz, in her review of the anthropological response across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, provides examples from the field work of Chiekh Niang (Fleck, 2015), Sylvain Faye, Juliene Anoko, Almudena Mari Saez, Fernanda Falero, Patricia Omidian, several Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) anthropologists and others (S. Abramowitz, 2017). However, Abramowitz argues that learning generated by these ethnographic studies was largely ignored by the mainstream response.",

Some critics have argued that social scientists in mostly European and North American universities were poorly suited to providing sound advice given their lack of familiarity with field-based operations. Adia Benton suggests that predominantly white northern anthropologists have an \u201cinflated sense of importance\u201d that led them to exaggerate the relevance of their research. This in turn helped reinforce concepts of \u201csuperior northern knowledge\u201d (Benton, 2017, p. 520). This racial optic seems to contradict the portrayal of plucky anthropologists being the victims of knowledge hierarchies that favour other knowledges over their own.",

Particularly relevant is Peter Haas\u2019 theory of epistemic communities. Haas helped define epistemic communities and how they differ from other policy communities, such as interest groups and advocacy coalitions (Haas, 1992). They share common principles and analytical and normative beliefs (causal beliefs). They have an authoritative claim to policy relevant expertise in a particular domain and Haas claims that policy actors will routinely place them above other interest groups in their level of expertise. He believes that epistemic communities and smaller more temporary collaborations within them, can influence policy. He observes that in times of crisis and acute uncertainty, policy actors often turn to them for advice.",

Namely, the UK was to lead in Sierra Leone, the United States in Liberia and the French in Guinea. This seems to have focused social scientists in the UK on engaging effectively with a government and wider scientific community who seemed to want to draw on their expertise. This was a relatively close-knit community of scholars who already worked together, co-published and cited each other's work and in many cases worked in the same academic institutions. Crucially, their ranks were swelled by a small number of epidemiologists and medical anthropologists who shared their concerns.",

            "text": "From the time MSF first warned the international community of an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in Guinea at the end of March 2014, it was six months before an identifiable and organised movement of social scientists emerged (MSF, 2015). Things began to happen quickly when the WHO announced in early September of that year that conventional biomedical responses to the outbreak were failing (WHO, 2014a). This acted like a siren call to social scientists incensed by the reported treatment of local communities and the way in which a narrative had emerged blaming local customs and ignorance for the rapid spread of the virus. British anthropologist, James Fairhead, hastily organised a special panel on Ebola at the African Studies Association (ASA) Annual Conference, that was taking place at the University of Sussex (UoS) on the September 10, 2014. Amongst the panellists were: Anthropologist Melissa Leach, Director of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS); Audrey Gazepo, University of Ghana, Medical anthropologist Melissa Parker from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM); Anthropologist and public health specialist, Anne Kelly from Kings College London and Stefan Elbe, UoS. Informally, after the conference, this group discussed the idea of an online repository or platform for the supply of regionally relevant social science (F. Martineau et al., 2017). This would later become the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform (ERAP). In the days and weeks that followed it was the personal and professional connections of these individuals that shaped the network engaging with the UK's intervention.\n",

Discussions took place on the funding and organisation of the anthropological response. The Government was already drawing on the expertise and capacity of Public Health England (PHE), the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Department of Health (DoH), to drive its response but social scientists had no seat at the table. The Government's Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Sally Davies called a meeting of the Ebola Scientific Assessment and Response Group (ESARG), on the 19th September, focused on issues which included community transmission of Ebola. Leach's inclusion as the sole anthropologist was largely thanks to Farrar and Chris Whitty, DFID's Chief Scientific Advisor (M Leach, 2014). There was already broad acceptance of the need for the response to focus on community engagement and the WHO had been issuing guidance on how to engage and what kind of messaging to use for those living in the worst affected areas (WHO, 2014c). In their account of these events three of the central actors from the UK's anthropological community describe how momentum gathered quickly and that: \u201cit felt as if we were pushing at an open door\u201d (F. Martineau et al., 2017, 481).",

A high level conference: Defeating Ebola in Sierra Leone, had been quickly organised, in partnership with the Sierra Leone Government, at which an international call for assistance was issued (DFID, 2014). It was shortly after this that the CMO, at the behest of the Government's Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBRA), formed the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies on Ebola (SAGE). By its first meeting on the October 16, 2014, British troops were on the ground along with volunteers from the UK National Health Service (NHS) (STC, 2016). Leach was pulled into this group along with most of the members of ESARG that had met the previous month. It was decided in this initial meeting to set up a social science sub-group including Whitty, Leach and the entire steering group of the newly established ERAP (SAGE, 2014a). This included not just British-based anthropologists but also Paul Richards and Esther Mokuwa from Njala University, Sierra Leone.

Face to face meetings could be held and committees joined in person (F. Martineau et al., 2017).

It is a quantitative approach rooted in graph theory and covers a range of methods which are frequently combined with qualitative methods (S. P. Borgatti et al., 2018). In this case, the network comprises of nodes who are the individuals identified as being directly involved in some of the key events just described. A second set of nodes are the events or interactions themselves. Content analysis of secondary sources linked to these events provides an unobtrusive method for identifying in some detail the actors who will have left traces of their involvement. SNA allows us to establish these actors\u2019 ties to common nodes (they were part of the same committee or event or contributed to the same reports.) Furthermore, we can assign non-network related attributes to each of our nodes such as gender, location, role and organisation affiliation type. Not only does this approach provide a quantitative assessment of who was involved and through which channels but the mathematical foundations of SNA allow for whole network analysis of cohesion across certain groups. You may calculate levels of homophily (the tendency of individuals to associate with similar others) between genders, disciplines and organisational type and identify sub-networks and the super-connectors that bridge them (S. P. Borgatti et al., 2018).",

Whereas gender and location are verifiable, the choice of whether an individual is an international policy actor or a national policy actor must be inferred from their official role during the crisis period. Sometimes this can be based on the identity of their home institution. Given DFID's central focus on overseas development assistance, its officials have been classified as internationals, rather than nationals. In some cases, individuals may be qualified clinicians or epidemiologists but their role in the crisis may have been primarily policy related and not medical or scientific. Therefore, they are classified as policy actors not scientists. Other demographic attributes could have been identified such as race and age which would have enabled more options for data analysis.",

Borgatti et al., 2002). Ties between nodes are now determined by connections through co-occurrence. We no longer need to see the events and committees themselves but can visualise the whole network as a social network of connected individuals. We can now observe and mathematically calculate, how inter-connected or homogeneous this research-policy network really is.",

We can also see three distinct sub-networks emerging, bridged by six key nodes with high centrality values. The highly interconnected sub-network on the right is shaped in part by ERAP and the production of briefings and their supply to a small number of policy actors. We can see here the visualisation of slightly higher centrality scores than for the government scientific advisors on the left. By treating this as a relational network we observe that interactions like the establishment of a SAGE sub-group for social scientists increased the homophily of the right side of the network and reduced its interconnectivity with the whole network. Although, one must be cautious about assigning too much significance to the position of individual nodes in a whole network analysis, the central location of the two social scientists and a DFID official closely correspond to the accounts of the crisis. This heterogeneous brokerage demonstrates the tendency of certain types of actors to be the sole link between dissimilar nodes (Hamilton et al., 2020). Likewise, some boundary nodes or outliers, such as one of the MOD's advisors at the bottom of the network, are directly mentioned in the qualitative accounts. Just four individuals in this whole network are based in Africa, suggesting almost complete isolation from humanitarians operating on the ground and from African scholarship.",

Olga Loblova argues that there is a selection bias in the tendency to look at case studies where there has been a shift in policy along the lines of the experts' knowledge. Likewise, Claire Dunlop suggests that Haas\u2019 framework may exaggerate their influence on policy. She separates the power of experts to control the production of knowledge and engage with key policy actors from policy objectives themselves. She refers to adult education literature and its implications for what decision makers learn from epistemic communities, or to put it another way, the cognitive influence of research evidence (Dunlop, 2009). She argues that the more control that knowledge exchange processes place with the \u201clearners\u201d in terms of framing, content and the intended policy outcomes, the less influential epistemic communities will be (Dunlop, 2017).",

From October 2014, anthropologists were arguing that given limited access to ETUs, which were struggling at that time, home care was an inevitability and so should be supported. Where they saw the provision of home care kits as an ethical necessity, many clinicians, humanitarians and global health professionals regarded home care as deeply unethical with the potential to lead to a two tier system of support (F. Martineau et al., 2017) and (Whitty et al., 2014). In Sierra Leone, Irish diplomat Sinead Walsh was baffled by what she saw as the blocking of the distribution of home care kits. An official from the US Centres for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) was quoted in an article in the New York Times as saying that home care was: \u201cadmitting defeat\u201d (Nossiter, 2014) in (Walsh and Johnson, 2018). Home care was never prioritised in Sierra Leone whereas in Liberia hundreds of thousands of kits were distributed (Walsh and Johnson, 2018).

In his study of UK think tanks, Jordan Tchilingirian suggests that policy think tanks operate on the periphery of more established networks and enjoy fluctuating levels of support and interest in their ideas. Ideas and knowledge do not simply flow within the network, given that dominant paradigms and political, social and cultural norms privilege better established knowledge communities (Tchilingirian, 2018). This is reminiscent of Meyer's work on the boundaries that exist between \u201camateurs\u201d and \u201cpolicy professionals\u201d (Meyer, 2008). Moira Faul's research on global education policy networks proposes that far from being \u201cflat,\u201d networks can augment existing power relations and knowledge hierarchies (Faul, 2016). This is worth considering when one observes how ERAP's supply of research knowledge and the SAGE sub-committee for anthropologists only increased the homophily of the social science sub-community, leaving it weakly connected to the core policy network (Fig. 4.).",

The International Development Select Committee (IDC) was very clear in its final report that social science had been a force for good in the response and recommended that DFID grow its internal anthropological capacity (IDC, 2016a, b). This contrasts to the report of the Science and Technology Committee (STC), which despite including evidence from at least one anthropologist, does not make a direct reference to anthropology in its report (STC, 2016). This is perhaps the public health officials in their core domain of infectious disease outbreaks reasserting their established authority. This sector has been described as the UK's \u201cBiomedical Bubble\u201d which benefits from much higher pubic support and funding than the social sciences (Jones and Wilsdon, 2018). Just the presence of anthropologists in an evidence session of the STC is a very rare event in contrast to the IDC which regularly reaches out to social scientists. Not everyone agrees that the threat of under-investing in social science was the primary issue. The STC's report highlights the view that there was a lack of front line clinicians represented on committees advising the UK Government, particularly from aid organisations (STC, 2016).",

Assuming the researcher has access to meeting minutes and other records of who attended which events or who was a member of which committees and groups, similar analysis of network homophily and centrality will be possible. The greatest potential for learning, with significant policy and research implications, comes from mixed methods approaches. By combining qualitative research to populate your network with a further round of data gathering to understand it better, you can reveal the social and political dynamics truly driving evidence use and decision making (Oliver and Faul, 2018).

            "text": "The epistemic community's interactivity with UK policy did not significantly alter policy design or implementation and it did not challenge fundamentally eurocentric development knowledge hierarchies. It was transformative only in as much as it helped the epistemic community itself learn how to operate in this environment. The real achievement has been on influencing longer term evidence use behaviours. They made the case for interdisciplinarity and the value of social science in emergency preparedness and response. The challenge now is moving from the rhetoric to action on complex infectious disease outbreaks. As demonstrated by Ebola in DRC and Covid-19, every global health emergency we face will have its own unique social and political dimensions. We must remain cognisant of the learning arising from the international response to Sierra Leone's tragic Ebola epidemic. It suggests that despite the increasing demand for interdisciplinarity, social science evidence is frequently contested and policy networks have a strong tendency to leave control over its production and use in the hands of others.",
