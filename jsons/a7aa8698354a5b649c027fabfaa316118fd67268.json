The major CT dimensions, including the presence of ground-glass opacities, 'crazy-paving sign', consolidation, and mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation lesions, were fully evaluated. The detailed definitions of the above features were as per a previous publication [3, 4] . The distribution of lung abnormalities was recorded as predominantly sub-pleural (involving mainly the peripheral one-third of the lung), central (involving mainly the central one-third of the lung), mixed (involving both sub-pleural and central regions), and diffuse (continuous involvement without respect to lung segments) according to a similar report [5] . The scattering patterns of lesions (focal, multifocal and diffuse) were also classified. The number of bilateral lung segments affected by pneumonia was recorded simultaneously.",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus related to the MERS and SARS coronaviruses [7, 8] has now spread to become a pandemic, with wide-ranging effects.We found that typical clinical symptoms were similar to those of other types of coronavirus infections, such as SARS and MERS [9] [10] [11] . CT chest findings were noted to be characteristic and have been detailed. There is usually a certain time interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. In our study, the time interval between the first chest CT examination and the onset was 0 to 11 days. An initial negative result of chest CT examination may occur (2 cases, 9%), but lung abnormalities could be discovered among most of the patients.Most of the patients had mild symptoms as well as temperature elevation, but their lung manifestations were relatively obvious. In contrast tothose in bacterial pneumonia [4] , lung lesions showed similar imaging features to other viral pneumonias, mainly ground glass opacities, extensive interlobular septal thickening and patchy consolidation. In the early stage, COVID-19 reflects mainly interstitial lung damage, such as thickening of the interlobular septa and the presence of ground glass opacities. Alveolar edema, exudation and bleeding can be manifested in different degrees of ground glass opacities on CT images, as inflammation involves the alveoli.In more than one-third of cases, abnormal lung manifestations were presented as a mixture of GGOs and consolidations, implying a rapid progression of pneumonia, which is probably due to a lower immune response in children than in adults. In severe cases, owing to the collapse of alveoli or massive infiltration of inflammatory cells, lung parenchymal injury may occur, presentingas lung consolidation. Although more detailed pathological changes of COVID-19 need to be further studied, research has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein domain, which is similar to the case for SARS-CoV. Given that it is highly contagious, its affinity may be greater than that of SARS-CoV [12] . Human ACE2 receptors are abundantly expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells. The outer bands of the lungs and the sub-pleural space are dense areas where terminal bronchi are dilated to form alveolar ducts, which can also explain the characteristics of lesion distribution from an anatomical perspective. In addition, thickened small blood vessel shadows and faint shadows surrounding the nodules are also characteristic in some reports.",

There is a certain similarity of chest CT imaging features between SARS and COVID-19 [14] . For instance, both GGOs and consolidations are dominant and concentrate mainly in bilateral sub-pleural areas; otherwise, cavities, pleural effusion and enlarged lymph nodes are rare. However, SARS had more severe interstitial fibrosis during the absorption phase of pneumonia. After discharge, CT images of SARS patients still showed thickening of the lobular septum, subpleural and distal bronchiolar dilatation, and honeycomb changes [15] . The lung lesions of SARS progressed more rapidly and were termed white out or 'white lung' because consolidation and coalescing infiltrates pervaded the lungs, leaving few recognized air spaces. The COVID-19 patients in this study did not show 'white lung', although we observed lesions involving 15 lung segments in one case, and the distribution of lesions was mainly subpleural. Furthermore, we note that 55% of cases involved less than three lung segments, which is different from previous reports of adult patients. This finding suggests that COVID-19 has a mild inflammatory infiltration in children, which indicates that they are more likely to recover than adults after symptomatic treatment, and the specific mechanism needs to be further studied.",
