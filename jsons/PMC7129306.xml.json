It may take some time to actually distill the question into component parts.10, 11, 12 However, it is important to get as specific as possible with the question so that the clinician can get relevant results from the literature search. A good question has 4 essential parts to it, which are best remembered by the following mnemonic PICO.1\nPatient population: The patient or the population who has similar attributes to your patient.2\nIntervention (or exposure): What happens or is done to that population. It might be an intervention or an exposure.3\nComparison: A well-defined comparison group that experiences a different intervention/exposure or no intervention/exposure.4\nOutcomes: The outcomes (eg, morbidity, mortality, quality of life, cost, and length of hospital stay) that are likely to be most important to patients, policy makers, service providers, or clinicians.\n",

            "text": "Once the clinician determines the type of question he/she is asking, he/she needs to identify the study design(s) that will best help answer it8, 10 (Table 1). The type of question will determine the type of literature that will yield the desired information. Each type of literature has its own pros and cons:1Systematic review: A systematic review uses an explicit and reproducible methodology to identify, appraise, and summarize primary studies. The methodology must state specific objectives, materials, and methods used. Although a systematic review may contain a meta-analysis, a meta-analysis is not always a systematic review. A meta-analysis reviews data from a number of studies and provides a statistical interpretation of whether the intervention is useful or not. A systematic review is distinct from a meta-analysis because of the stringent methodology (eg, The Cochrane Library).2Critically appraised topic (CATs): A critically appraised topic begins with a question. Relevant literature is then retrieved and synthesized. Risks, benefits, and cost for each treatment option are weighed with the available evidence. Multiple critical appraisals may be distilled into larger CATs (eg, CAT Crawler).3Randomized clinical trials (RCTs): An RCT is a study of the effect of therapy on real patients. The methodology includes minimization of bias (randomization and blinding) and comparison of defined variables and outcomes between groups (different interventions including no intervention). Limitations are usually associated with methodology problems (eg, ARDSnet trial for low-tidal-volume ventilation).4Cohort studies: Cohort studies involve a large population that is followed for a period of time. Patients are grouped by the presence or absence of a particular clinical condition or by having (or not having) received a particular treatment regimen. There is no attempt to stratify other variables, and the 2 groups may be significantly different because of this (eg, Framingham Heart Study).5Case-control studies: Case-control studies involve patients with a specific clinical condition who are \u201cmatched\u201d with patients who do not have the condition. The matching points include age, sex, associated diseases, and so on. These studies may be prospective or retrospective. Retrospective studies may be confounded by incomplete medical records and patient recall issues. Showing a statistical relationship does not necessarily indicate causation (eg, early studies examining the relation between tobacco smoking and lung cancer).6Cross-sectional study: A cross-sectional study observes a defined population at a single point in time or time interval. Exposure and outcome are determined simultaneously. This type of study is used to determine the incidence and prevalence of disease in a particular population.7Case reports and case series: Case reports and series are presentations of the treatment of a single patient or small group of patients. There is no statistical validity because there is no group for comparison. These reports can be helpful in identifying a question that should be evaluated and answered. They play an important role in the discovery of new diseases and unexpected side effects of new drugs. They played an important part in the epidemiology of West Nile encephalitis in New York and tracing the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic.8Expert opinion: An expert opinion is a summary of findings reflecting current thinking on the topic written by a recognized expert in the field. When using these resources, it is important for clinicians to consider whether the author used a thorough and systematic process to gather information used to formulate their findings, opinions, and recommendations. Not every resource clearly identifies this information (eg, physician-authored information and advice on conditions and treatments in resources such as UpToDate or eMedicine).\n",

The systematic reviews in the Cochrane database include interventions (therapy). These are very comprehensive reviews and can be found via various search engines such as Ovid, PubMed, TRIP Database, SumSearch, and the Cochrane site. The Cochrane Database also includes the Cochrane Anesthesia Group (http://www.carg.cochrane.org/en/index.html), which produces reviews in the following 8 areas of anesthesia: (1) ambulatory anesthesia and anesthesia outside the operating room, (2) anesthesia and medical disease, (3) drugs in anesthesia and intensive care medicine, (4) perianesthetic and perioperative care medicine, (5) postanesthetic unit and intensive care unit, (6) prehospital medicine, resuscitation, and emergency medicine, (7) regional anesthesia, (8) technology in anesthesia and intensive care medicine. This is a great resource when faced with a common clinical question that has to be answered in a limited time.13 The reviews are periodically updated; however. it is good practice to look at the date of last update and deduce if the conclusions are still relevant at the time they are needed.2DARE (Database of Reviews of Effects): This is a free database consisting of critically appraised summaries of non-Cochrane systematic reviews. It contains more than 6,000 quality-assessed reviews. DARE is produced by the reviewers and information staff of the National Health Services' Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, England, and consists of structured abstracts of systematic reviews from all over the world. DARE records cover topics such as diagnosis, prevention, rehabilitation, screening, and treatment. The abstracts are accompanied by a commentary indicating the strengths and weaknesses of the process used for the review. The database contains more than 500 abstracts related to the practice of anesthesia.3PIER (Physician Information Education Resource): Provided by the American College of Physicians (ACP), this resource offers compendia of evidence on the effects of common clinical interventions, providing explicit recommendations. PIER has a number of synopses related to cardiac anesthesia such as perioperative management of congestive cardiac failure (Fig 1), rhythm and conduction abnormalities, and perioperative management of diabetes mellitus.4Clinical Evidence: Clinical Evidence, from the British Medical Journal, provides information on therapies for numerous conditions; however, this resource focuses on summarizing the strength of the evidence available for benefits and harms of specific treatments. Clinical Evidence uses systematic reviews, RCTs, and observational studies to find the best evidence available regarding therapies. If no good or conclusive evidence exists for a treatment, it will indicate this as well. Rather than suggest or promote specific interventions, physicians are encouraged to examine the evidence for each therapy to decide what action to take. Information on new evidence for each condition is updated every 6 months.5US National Guidelines Clearinghouse (NGC): This resource contains both US and international evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The NGC also groups guidelines that cover similar topics and offers synthesis of these. In addition, clinicians can find expert commentary of important issues related to the development, use, and attributes of clinical guidelines in general.\n",

Created and compiled by the United States National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, Medline is intricately linked to PubMed, a free interface for searching Medline material. PubMed has more than 19 million citations and links from article references to articles about the same or similar topics, articles that cite the specific reference, and the publishers' versions of electronic full-text copies of articles. Most of these full-text versions are not provided for free by the publishers, however, and clinicians may need to pay for each article. Medline can also be searched using Ovid or Scopus interfaces.2PubMed Clinical Queries: This feature in PubMed allows physicians to search Medline by restricting the search to the type of question the physicians are trying to answer (which they label etiology, diagnosis, therapy, prognosis, and clinical prediction guides). It brings back results that are likely to have direct clinical application based on the type of question identified.3EMBASE: This database contains more than 19 million indexed records from more than 7,000 peer-reviewed journals across all disciplines and areas of health sciences research. However, EMBASE searches across journals and resources that have a focus on drugs and allied health disciplines.4Scopus: This is a large abstract and citation database covering literature in the fields of physical, life, medical, and social sciences from more than 18,000 peer-reviewed journals. More than half of Scopus' content originates internationally, and references go back to 1996. Scopus also searches Web sites, patents, trade publications, and conference papers.\n",

Whereas WebMD material focuses primarily on providing health and medical information to consumers, eMedicine's audience is health care professionals. The format for eMedicine is similar to that of a textbook, providing a large amount of background information and recommended guidelines. It has a section on perioperative care that includes topics of interest to anesthesiologists.3MD Consult: This suite of resources, compiled by Elsevier, includes information from different types of materials. Clinicians can use MD Consult to search more than 50 medical reference books and online journals that often link to full-text versions of articles from Elsevier-published journals. This resource also provides access to most of the Clinics of North America and weekly reviews of new developments from government agencies and medical conferences.

It is important to understand what they mean and when they can be helpful.\u2022MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) Database: It refers to the US National Library of Medicine's controlled vocabulary used for indexing articles for MEDLINE/PubMed. MeSH terminology provides a consistent way to retrieve information that may use different terminology for the same concepts. MeSH terms are arranged in a hierarchical fashion with more general terms leading to more focused terms.17 For example, a clinician looking for literature on Aprotinin could look up Aprotinin in the search box of the MeSH database. The MeSH database will retrieve results with Links to all articles referring to Aprotinin or the ones where Aprotinin is the major topic (Fig 2). Using the MeSH database helps clinicians find the articles they might otherwise have missed by simply searching various key words that authors may or may not have used.\u2022Boolean operators: Boolean logic operators help define relationships among search terms. The 3 boolean operators are \u201cAND,\u201d \u201cOR,\u201d and \u201cNOT.\u201d Searchers use \u201cAND\u201d to expand a search to retrieve only citations that include all of the search terms (either in a key word search or a search using MeSH headings).18 The operator \u201cOR\u201d opens the search up to include citations that contain any one of the researcher's search terms. Finally, \u201cNOT\u201d restricts the search so that citations with a specific term in either their indexed vocabulary or within the abstract and text are not retrieved by the search. Clinicians can use boolean operators in their search string to help refine their search strategy. For instance, searching \u201cAmicar AND Aprotinin\u201d will retrieve articles that discuss both drugs. However, the search \u201camicar OR aprotinin\u201d will bring back a set of articles that are about one of either search term; a much larger set of citations than the search using \u201cAND.\u201d Typically, when searching most databases, the boolean operators should be typed in as all capital letters to identify their use as boolean terms and not terms associated with the search strategy.\n",

Applying the steps discussed earlier can save time in getting the information needed:1Step 1: Formulate the question. Using the PICO method (see earlier), the question would read as follows: In patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (population), does the use of direct thrombin inhibitors (intervention) rather than heparin (comparison) result in decreased morbidity (outcome)?2Step 2: This is a therapy question.3Step 3: This question is best answered with an RCT or systematic review.4Step 4: Using the clinical queries utility of PubMed (Fig 3), inserting the search phrase \u201cheparin induced thrombocytopenia\u201d and \u201ccardiac surgery\u201d and checking the \u201ctherapy\u201d box with narrow search criteria bring the number of retrieved articles to just 12 (Fig 4). The third article in this list focuses on the EVOLUTION trial comparing patients who received bivalirudin for on-pump cardiac surgery with those receiving heparin and protamine and found that mortality, 24-hour blood loss, overall incidence of transfusions, and duration of surgery were similar between the 2 groups. The \u201crelated articles\u201d link leads searchers to other relevant papers addressing this topic. Because the most relevant articles favor the use of bivalirudin as a safe alternative, the anesthesiologist opts to use bivalirudin for anticoagulation in this patient.\n",

One solution is to subscribe to an alert service that scans specified journals and sends subscribers the table of contents. Physicians can subscribe to the table of contents from each journal Web site or use alert services that scan multiple journals. An example of an alert service that provides an online table of contents from multiple journals is AMEDEO (http://amedeo.com). AMEDEO arranges journals based on 25 medical topics with various subtopics. For instance, the subtopics of \u201cAnesthesia\u201d and \u201cPain Management\u201d are listed under the category \u201cCritical Care.\u201d The subtopic of \u201cAnesthesia\u201d contains a list of 31 journals important to the field of anesthesiology. Physicians can either click on a listed journal and get its table of contents for the previous 12 to 24 months, or they can sign up for AMEDEO's free e-mail service. By selecting the clinician's favorite journals in any category, the clinician will receive weekly emails with a list of articles published in the journal subset. E-mails typically contain bibliographic information for each reference (authors, title, journal, year of publication, and volume, pages) including a link to the article's abstract on PubMed.21 Individuals can also subscribe to podcasts of summaries of journal articles (eg, New England Journal of Medicine) or summaries of systematic reviews from The Cochrane Library and listen to them at leisure.",

            "text": "The following are some issues that prevent the busy practitioner from accessing literature relevant to a clinical question.1The indexing of journal articles is done using MeSH terms, which are semantically limited and do not always express the meaning of the text.2 Although MeSH terms help focus search, they are not intuitive to use. In addition, the method to finding the most appropriate MeSH terms to use in a search differs among databases. For instance, finding MeSH terms in PubMed is different from finding them in Ovid's Medline interface. Medical librarians can assist anesthesiologists in understanding and using the correct MeSH terms to bring back the most pertinent references when searching.2There is an inherent delay in receipt and indexing of journals, which can vary depending on the organization indexing them. Most publishers submit their references to PubMed before or at the time of publication, so the lag time is not great for references appearing in that database. There are, however, inconsistencies in how search engines post unindexed articles. For instance, PubMed will include article abstracts that do not yet have MeSH terms assigned, but Ovid Medline will not. However, until articles are indexed in PubMed, they cannot be found using a MeSH search strategy but rather only through key word searching. This may mean that a clinician will need to conduct more than 1 search to find all articles on a topic.3Finding free citations to articles and publications does not automatically lead searchers to free full-text versions of those articles. Most publishers will require a fee for researchers to access an article often known as \u201cpay-per-view.\u201d This does not allow the searcher to copy the article or forward it for distribution to others. If the clinician is affiliated with a facility or institution that has a medical library, he may be able to access an article through the library's subscriptions to the full text of many journals. However, it is worth remembering that with publishers' costs rising for institutional licenses, many libraries have been forced to cut subscriptions. Almost all libraries will offer free interlibrary loan services, although there may be a wait of a number of days before they can get the article(s) to you. Most databases, such as UpToDate and The Cochrane Library, will allow individuals to pay for access not only to the database but often to a particular group of full text journals as well. Fees for access vary depending on the database and the number of full text journals to which they provide access.\n",

However, clinical decision-making should incorporate the results of formal research. Established guidelines and traditional practice are constantly challenged for cost-effectiveness and safety profiles. Physicians strive to assimilate the best evidence into daily practice. The skills necessary to practice evidence-based medicine as well as to manage information overload are not adequately addressed in residencies and fellowship programs worldwide, although medical schools are beginning to incorporate information seeking skills into their curriculum.26 The need for a dialog regarding the form and content of information management strategies is apparent. Working in an interdisciplinary environment, anesthesiologists are uniquely positioned to disseminate new knowledge and provide leadership in developing perioperative practice guidelines using current information to improve patient outcomes. By following simple steps, anesthesiologists and other clinicians can more quickly and efficiently find relevant and reliable information to help them make the best decisions for their patients.",
