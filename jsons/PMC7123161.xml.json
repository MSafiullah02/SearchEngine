The implementation of routine screening policies has improved the early diagnosis of cancer, and treatment advances have been achieved, with the result that prolonged survival or complete recovery can be obtained in many patients. Intensive and prolonged treatment regimens introduced over the last decade have increased the overall survival rates among patients with various types of malignancies [1]. For instance, intensified and shortened cyclical chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in adults has improved survival [2], advances in the understanding of multiple myeloma have led to the development of new drugs [3], targeted therapies have proved useful in patients with lymphoma and chronic myeloid leukaemia [4, 5], and growth factors that hasten neutropenia recovery have allowed higher-dose chemotherapy regimens that increase the chances for a cure [6]. However, treatment-related toxic and infectious complications have increased in lockstep with the expanding use of aggressive cancer treatments.",

Although the need for early treatment, most notably with antimicrobials, is universally recognized, debate continues about the best diagnostic strategy in cancer patients with pulmonary infiltrates [16]. Suggested diagnostic strategies cover an extensive spectrum ranging from empirical treatment without diagnostic investigations to diagnostic lung biopsy. However, most groups recommend diagnostic investigations. The main difference across strategies consists in whether fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (FO-BAL) is performed (Table 15.2) [16]. The debate about the appropriateness of FO-BAL is particularly relevant in patients with hypoxemic ARF, among whom 40% experience respiratory status deterioration when FO-BAL is performed [17\u201319]. This risk must be weighed against the increased risk of death that is independently associated with failure to identify the cause of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with cancer [11, 20\u201322].\n\ufeff",

We will start by briefly reviewing our DIRECT approach designed to increase the likelihood of appropriate anti-infectious therapy being given within 2 h after ICU admission (Fig. 15.1). We do not recommend a strategy based solely on the DIRECT approach, because identifying the cause of the pulmonary infiltrates increases the chances of survival. We describe the two main strategies for identifying the cause of pulmonary infiltrates, i.e., with and without FO-BAL. Because the diagnostic efficiency of FO-BAL was evaluated recently [16], we will focus on the strategy that does not include FO-BAL. In our ICU experience, although FO-BAL combined with other investigations fails to identify the cause of ARF in 10\u201315% of patients [11, 23], severe hypoxemia and associated organ dysfunctions limit the feasibility of lung biopsy in many cases. However, studies have found lung biopsy to be highly efficient, and we raise this point in the last section of this review, which identifies areas for future research that may help us to improve the management of these very vulnerable patients.\n",

However, all these patterns need to be re-evaluated using new technologies to assess the cellular defects.

These advantages were reported to be particularly helpful in patients at very high risk of death if treated with mechanical ventilation [37]. The results of 18 studies (in 1,537 patients) indicated that FO-BAL provided the diagnosis in about half the patients and led to treatment modifications in one-third (Table 15.3). These data were confirmed by a recent retrospective study [38], including 175 haematological patients admitted to the ICU for ARF and showing a 10% rate of life-threatening complications after FO-BAL. Moreover, the diagnostic yield was only 50%, and the therapeutic impact was significant in only 17% of the patients [38].\n",

First, most patients are already on antimicrobial therapy at the time of FO-BAL. Therefore, bacterial pneumonia is usually documented clinically but not bacteriologically, although FO-BAL may detect resistant pathogens that require adjustment of the antimicrobial regimen. Second, BAL fluid analysis is often confined to tests for infections, and most studies fail to report the appearance of the alveolar cells, which may suggest drug toxicity, or the presence of malignant cells, indicating pulmonary infiltration. Third, most studies were conducted in the 1990s, before the introduction of new tools for diagnosing infections with viruses, parasites, and fungi [39]. However, the diagnostic yield of FO-BAL was not better in recent studies [11, 40]. Last, FO-BAL may be less efficient in patients with cancer than in those with AIDS because of pathophysiological differences in the development of pulmonary invasion by Aspergillus or Pneumocystis [30, 41\u201345]. For instance, a study of PCP in cancer patients showed marked inflammation and scarce Pneumocystis bodies, indicating that negative BAL fluid findings did not rule out PCP [43].",

Low titres of antibodies against Legionella spp. have been found in healthy volunteers, blood donors, outpatients, and hospitalised patients [49, 50]. These low titres seem to indicate previous exposure to Legionella spp. The urinary antigen test produced positive results 1\u20133 days after the clinical onset and remained positive for almost 1 year in a small proportion of patients [51, 52]. Importantly, the urinary antigen test showed greater than 99% specificity [53]. Sensitivity for L. pneumophila infections ranged from 56% to 99% [54]. Low sensitivity of urinary antigen assays for serogroups other than L. pneumophila serogroup 1 has been reported, the range being 14\u201369% [55, 56].

Blood culture results are positive in only about one-fourth of cases, and prior antibiotic therapy significantly reduces the proportion of positive blood culture results. Bacteraemia may be absent in 70\u201380% of cases of S. pneumoniae pneumonia. Sputum cultures provide only a probable diagnosis, since S. pneumoniae carriage in the nasopharynx is common. PCR assays for S. pneumoniae have shown inadequate sensitivity when used on blood or urine and inadequate specificity for infection when used on respiratory samples. Several publications have described antigen detection assays. Good sensitivity and specificity have been reported with commercial kits for urinary C polysaccharide detection in adults. For example, the Binax NOW S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test was 82% sensitive and 97% specific when positive blood cultures were used as the reference standard. The test is simple to perform, detects the C polysaccharide cell wall antigen common to all S. pneumoniae strains, and provides results within 15 min. Urinary antigen was still detected in 83% of patients who were retested on treatment day 3 and persisted for at least 7 days in many patients [58]. Additional studies produced similar results (Table 15.5) [59\u201361]. A nested PCR assay targeting the pneumolysin gene was used to detect S. pneumoniae DNA in multiple sample types from 474 adults with community-acquired pneumonia and 183 control patients without pneumonia. The assay added little to information from existing diagnostic tests for S. pneumoniae and was unable to distinguish colonisation from infection when used on respiratory samples [59, 61]. Studies of S. pneumoniae antigen tests involving latex agglutination or counter-current immunoelectrophoresis showed detection rates ranging from 0% to 88%, and specificity was often poorly defined.\n",

This method is of uncertain value in immunocompromised patients, most notably those with impaired cell-mediated immunity. Culturing is relatively insensitive and time-consuming, requiring up to 3 weeks for pathogen detection [62]. A number of PCR assays for M. pneumoniae have been evaluated in various respiratory specimens and patient populations, with promising results. PCR is more sensitive and considerably faster than culturing. In general, PCR results correlate well with serological results [63]. Both upper and lower respiratory tract samples are suitable for PCR testing. Upper respiratory tract samples (throat swabs and nasopharyngeal samples) may be the preferred sample types, as they are easy to obtain and ensure high sensitivity [59]. PCR on throat swabs may be the best existing diagnostic test for M. pneumoniae. However, standardised protocols will have to be developed before this test is recommended for widespread use [64].",

Therefore, the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection relies largely on serological testing, whose value in immunocompromised patients is uncertain. Furthermore, both acute- and convalescent-phase sera must be tested, which can only provide a retrospective diagnosis. These major limitations have prompted many studies of PCR for diagnosing C. pneumoniae infection. Unfortunately, the results have been conflicting. Overall, PCR was at least as sensitive as culturing, but its specificity was difficult to assess given the absence of an appropriate reference standard [59]. C. pneumoniae DNA can be detected in both upper and lower respiratory tract samples, but it is unclear which sampling site is better. Highly sensitive PCR techniques may increase the ability to detect C. pneumoniae carriage, the clinical relevance of which is unclear.",

However, 2\u201310 days were usually needed to obtain the results. To overcome this major limitation, faster diagnostic techniques, such as viral antigen detection, were introduced. These faster techniques are generally considered less sensitive and less specific than cell cultures. Moreover, viral antigen detection is not feasible for all respiratory viruses. PCR has proven extremely specific and sensitive for detecting respiratory viruses: it is now the reference standard for diagnosing respiratory viral infections and the only method available for detecting some viruses [39]. PCR was not only more sensitive than viral culture or antigen or antibody tests for detecting respiratory viruses in patients with haematological malignancies, but also decreased the time to diagnosis [65, 66]. Parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza viruses A and B, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses were reliably detected by PCR [67\u201369]. Nose-throat swabs yielded the same results with PCR as did BAL samples [39]. In a recent study of patients with haematological malignancies and respiratory viral infections, PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates usually provided the diagnosis [70]. In the near future, widespread use of multiplex PCRs in patients with haematological malignancies will raise additional concerns about the relevance of virus retrieval from nasopharyngeal aspirates in patients with lung infiltrates [69].",

Although HSV type 1 accounts for most cases, other herpes viruses such as cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, HHV-6, and HHV-8 are also common causes of pneumonia in this population. Advances in diagnostic techniques and the use of preventive or pre-emptive treatments have altered the epidemiology of some of the herpes virus infections. However, herpes viruses continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in stem cell recipients [72]. A multiplex PCR assay designed to amplify herpes virus DNA in a diverse range of clinical specimens yielded higher detection rates for the viruses represented in the assay than did virus isolation and immunofluorescence-based antigen detection [73]. The turnaround time was far less than for the other techniques. Overall, the multiplex PCR detected substantially more herpes viruses, in some cases in specimens or at body sites where these viruses were found only rarely or never using conventional methods. Multiplex PCR has not yet been evaluated as a tool for diagnosing herpes virus pneumonia in patients with cancer. However, multiplex PCR may help to assess the pathogenic role for herpes viruses found in respiratory samples. An oligonucleotide microarray for herpes virus detection in clinical samples has been developed and needs to be evaluated in clinical practice.",

Several studies confirmed that PCR was more sensitive than microscopy for detecting P. jiroveci [75]. PCR is useful to rule out P. jiroveci infection in HIV-negative immunocompromised patients, who often have lower parasite counts than AIDS patients [43]. Nested PCR methods tend to have low specificity with high false-positive rates, whereas real-time PCR seems more specific [39, 76\u201378]. Samples similar to those used for microscopy can serve for PCR [75]. BAL specimens have the best yield; induced sputum samples, which are commonly used for HIV-infected patients, may be diagnostic but have not been evaluated in patients with other causes of immunodeficiency. [77]. Oral washes may be used as alternative non-invasive samples, despite lower sensitivity of PCR compared to lower respiratory tract samples [42, 79]. In a recent study [80], 448 patients were screened for P. jiroveci pneumonia with PCR and Gromori-Grocott staining. BAL was performed in 351 patients and induced sputum was diagnostic in 39 patients. PCR sensitivity was 87% and specificity was 92%, Negative predictive value on BAL samples was 98.7%. Given this excellent negative predictive value, we recommend PCR as the leading method for excluding PCP in cancer patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Negative PCR results on BAL fluid or induced sputum indicate that PCP treatment can be safely discontinued [81].",

            "text": "The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in haematological patients is often challenging. Until recently, only specimens from normally sterile sites were considered necessary for the definitive diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. Specimens from sites that may be colonised (e.g., sputum, BAL fluid, or sinus aspirate) were rarely diagnostic. BAL fluid cultures positive for Aspergillus spp. may indicate colonisation instead of invasive infection. Cultures may require days or weeks. The reference standard is histologically proven hyphal invasion in tissue specimens obtained by invasive procedures, but these may be deemed unsafe in patients with cytopenia [44, 82]. The first prospective, pathology-verified evaluation of a sandwich ELISA using a monoclonal antibody to galactomannan (GM) showed that serial monitoring was 92.6% sensitive and 95.4% specific [83]. The positive predictive value was 93%, and the negative predictive value was 95% [83]. In more than half the cases, antigenaemia was detected before invasive aspergillosis was suspected clinically [84, 85]. Based on this study and others, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group convened a consensus panel to develop standard definitions for invasive fungal infections, introducing Aspergillus antigenaemia testing as an important diagnostic tool. The panel recommended that Aspergillus antigenaemia testing be used to support a probable diagnosis [44]. The value of this diagnostic strategy has been clinically validated [86, 87] and shown to be clinically relevant. Moreover, the diagnostic yield of Aspergillus antigenaemia may be higher in neutropenic patients [88]. Finally, PCR has been used to detect Aspergillus spp., but false-positive results were noted, and no standardised commercial method is available [89\u201391].",

            "text": "Numerous multivariate analyses have shown that inadequate antibiotic therapy in patients with severe sepsis is a strong and independent risk factor for death [92]. In clinical practice, diagnostic uncertainty regarding the causative microorganism leads to the use of broad-spectrum combinations of antibiotics. The high selection pressure created by these combinations may lead to the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Moreover, in patients with haematological malignancies, who are often neutropenic, the diagnostic yield of blood samples is low (25% in one study [93] and probably even less in patients on concomitant antibiotic therapy), and more than half the clinically diagnosed infections are treated empirically. These data may reflect the presumed low bacterial/fungal load necessary for clinical infection. Therefore, rapid diagnostic tests are needed [94]. In recent years, several diagnostic tools based on culture-independent molecular biology-based techniques, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction, were developed [95]. However, their usefulness in clinical practice needs to be demonstrated. Numerous studies are ongoing. In severe sepsis [96], the match between PCR and blood culture results seems disappointing, with only 70% of positive PCRs in patients with positive blood cultures. However, positive PCR results showed statistically significant associations with higher organ dysfunction scores, as well as a trend toward an association with higher mortality. In immunocompromised patients, the results of preliminary studies of PCR seem more promising, although the true accuracy of these methods needs to be determined [97, 98]. PCR seems more sensitive than blood cultures, with a 100% match between positive blood cultures and positive PCR, as well as a high negative predictive value (98.6%) of negative PCR. However, these results require confirmation in larger studies, and their clinical usefulness needs to be tested in terms of antibiotic use and treatment reduction.",

Identification of the exact cause of ARF is associated with a marked improvement in survival. Rapid evaluation of the contribution of left ventricular failure to ARF enables prompt adequate treatment, obviating the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. Echocardiography is the reference standard for diagnosing left ventricular dysfunction but requires the availability of an experienced sonographer. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a predominantly ventricular cardiac hormone whose levels increase in the event of cardiac overdistension [99]. BNP measurement has been found highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of heart failure [100]. However, in the initial cohort, no cancer patients were included.",

For example, PCT can differentiate between bacterial and viral meningitis. Data from neutropenic patients are scarce except in the paediatric population, where small studies [103, 104] suggested that PCT might be a good marker for bacterial sepsis with more than 95% negative predictive value and more than 85% sensitivity. In adults, no convincing data are available. Some studies in neutropenic patients [105] indicated that PCT was unhelpful (although we have personal data that seems somewhat more promising).
