However, in Colombia, the country that holds the highest taxonomic richness of this order of mammals in the Neotropics, up to date there are no reports of T. gondii in bats (Carollia brevicauda). Purpose The objective of the present study was to detect T. gondii DNA from internal bat organs from Quind\u00edo, Colombia. Results We report the first detection of T. gondii DNA from internal bat organs in the department of Quindio, Central Andes of Colombia. Out of three silky short tail bat (Carollia brevicauda) specimens collected at the natural reserve \"La Monta\u00f1a del Ocaso\", organs were recovered (lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, small and large intestine) and tested for T. gondii through PCR for B1 sequence, with 1/3 (33.3%) positive result for the presence of T. gondii DNA in bat kidney tissues. Conclusion Taking into consideration the high diversity of bat species in Colombia, and the complexity of the ecological and functional relationships that these organisms establish in the ecosystems they inhabit, we discuss on the urgent need for more detailed research and surveys for Toxoplansma in bats and other mammalian wild species.",

The first report of T. gondii in bat species occurred in 1965 by Galuzo and collaborators through parasite isolation in two insectivorous bats, Noctalus noctula and Vespertilio serotinus, in Kazakhstan [8] . Later, in South America, the first report dates from 1969 in Brazil, obtained through the isolation of T. gondii parasite in four bats by bioassay in mice [9] . Toxoplasmosis has been reported in captive flying-foxes (Pteropus conspicillatus and P. scapulatus), being the first symptomatic cases of these diseases in a wild species [10] . The first case of T. gondii isolation and genotyping by sequencing of SAG1 gene occurred in 2013 [4] , raising the interest of researchers of detecting T. gondii in bats and trying to describe prevalences, parasite acquisition and infection source, distribution and genetic relationships. Prevalences between 6.1-21.6% (Table 1) have been reported, being the most prevalent genotype related to the clonal type [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

We used PCR to detect T. gondii because it is sensitive enough to detect low quantities of parasites and are accessible for routine analyses [14] . Although we have a low number of samples, it could represent a high T. gondii DNA percentage in bats by PCR in contrast different studies realized until today ( Table 1 ). The positive sample was confirmed to be from T. gondii DNA through sequencing and alignment (Fig. 2) and blast with our positive control (B1 sequence from T. gondii DNA of RH strain) and a reference sequence reported in GenBank with accession number AF179871 [19] . The few differences presented in alignment should be interpreted with precaution because it is not necessarily a different genotype or strain from T. gondii. To obtain the circulation of specific genotypes, one needs multi-locus analysis, using different genes like ROP18 [22] , with a good amount and quality of DNA [16] . The individual that tested positive for T. gondii in this study had no symptoms of infection at the moment of its capture. Infected bats by T. gondii remain most of the times without symptoms like hindlimb paralysis, respiratory distress, panting and anorexia [4, 10] , acting as vectors and transmitting the infection to other animals. Although little is known on the behavioral changes associated with toxoplasmosis for most bat species, individuals on the ground or exposed out of their refugia may represent a potential public health threat [23] . The warm and humid environments, like the one from the natural reserve in which we captured the positive bat individual, are more suitable for the survival of T. gondii oocysts [24] .",

Carollia brevicauda is abundant in premontane and montane Andean forests, in which it feeds from a wide variety of fruit resources [26] . It is possible that the food resource acted as the source of parasite acquisition, which could had been in contact with contaminated water, and the low dietary selectivity of C. brevicauda [27] reinforces this possibility. Another possibility can be given by a direct contact with contaminated water. Bats could drink frequently from ponds and other water sources, which could be potentially contaminated with T. gondii oocysts. Some reports in Quind\u00edo have confirmed the presence of DNA T. gondii in water samples before plants treatment, with a frequency of 76,9% (10/13) [16] . T. gondii infection in insectivorous and frugivorous bats also suggests that the caves where bats live are contaminated with T. gondii oocysts [28] .",

Furthermore, some bat species are considered staples in the diet of several species of wild felids, as well as domestic cats, which can disseminate oocysts into the environment. Previous studies have shown that the rate of T. gondii infection in felids is related to predator-prey relationships, and therefore dependent on the availability prey species [32] .
