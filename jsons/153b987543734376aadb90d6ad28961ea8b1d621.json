A recent review in this journal found no relationship between contact lens use and COVID-19 infection [2] , perhaps in part because it is rare to find the SARS-CoV-2 virus even in the tear films of patients who have tested positive for the disease [3] . Similarly, bodies such as the United Kingdom College of Optometrists [4] , the British Contact Lens Association [5] and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [6] have also indicated this same lack of association. Despite these reports and recommendations, there have been media reports to suggest that ceasing contact lens wear is recommended at this time.",

To this end, a survey was conducted from April 9-12, 2020 amongst contact lens wearers who had recently attended the Eurolens Research group at the University of Manchester for clinical studies. Because this work was considered to be 'market research' by the university and as no personal information was captured, no ethical approval was required. Subjects taking part on current studies were excluded. A total of 433 people were e-mailed and asked to complete a simple questionnaire hosted through the university's online survey engine.",

Of the lockdown group, 20 (22%) reported using their contact lenses about the same as usual, five (6%) were using their lenses more than usual with the remaining 64 patients (72%) wearing their lenses less than normal.

The most common explanation was that there was simply a perception of 'less need' for contact lenses for those currently at home (75% of those reporting reduced wear) often reported as being because (a) wearers use lenses when meeting friends or socialising (which is not currently possible), (b) contact lens wear is associated looking and feeling appropriately dressed for work (which is presently suspended) or (c) lens use is considered to be particularly beneficial in a 'distance-orientated' world rather than an indoors situation.",
