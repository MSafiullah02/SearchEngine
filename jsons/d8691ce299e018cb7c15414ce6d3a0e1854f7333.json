We document that firms that are more resilient to social distancing significantly outperformed those with lower resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak, even after controlling for the standard risk factors. Similar cross-sectional return differentials already emerged before the COVID-19 crisis: the 2014-19 cumulative return differential between more and less resilient firms is of similar size as during the outbreak, suggesting growing awareness of pandemic risk well in advance of its materialization. Finally, we use stock option prices to infer the markets return expectations after the onset of the pandemic: even at a two-year horizon, stocks of more pandemic-resilient firms are expected to yield significantly lower returns than less resilient ones, reflecting their lower exposure to disaster risk. Hence, going forward, markets appear to price exposure to a new risk factor, namely, pandemic risk.",

The effects of the pandemic are widely perceived not to be purely transient, as witnessed by current changes in expectations (Coibion et al., 2020b; Hanspal et al., 2020; Coibion et al., 2020a) and in asset prices (Gormsen and Koijen, 2020) . But its effects are also proving to be quite heterogeneous: some firms, especially in high-tech industries, appear to have adapted quite well to social distancing requirements, for instance by resorting extensively to teleworking, while others, such as food catering, travel and tourism, could not do so, as the nature of their business requires close contact with customers and/or among employees. This heterogeneity is also visible in the diverging stock price performance of companies: in the first quarter of 2020, stocks such as Apple, Microsoft and Google outperformed the market, yielding market-adjusted returns of 19%, 12% and 33% respectively, while others such as Marriott, United Airlines and Royal Caribbean massively underperformed, with market-adjusted returns of \u221238%, \u221253% and \u221266%.",

Furthermore, we investigate the returns that investors expect the two stock classes to generate after the COVID-19 shock, by extracting the expected stock returns implied by option prices. We find that, going forward, pandemic-resilient stocks are expected to generate lower excess returns, indicating that, since the COVID-19 pandemic materialized, the market has priced a disaster premium.",

But it should be recalled that as early as five years before the COVID-19 outbreak, high-profile business and political leaders already issued public warnings of the risk of devastating epidemics. For instance, in a speech delivered on 2 December 2014 at the NIH about the response to the Ebola epidemic, U.S. President Barack Obama stated: \"There may and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne disease that is deadly. And in order for us to deal with that effectively, we have to put in place an infrastructure -not just here at home, but globally -that allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly. [...] So that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up five years from now or a decade from now, we've made the investment and we're further along to be able to catch it. It is a smart investment for us to make. It's not just insurance; it is knowing that down the road we're going to continue to have problems like this -particularly in a globalized world where you move from one side of the world to the other in a day.\"",

Our empirical analysis in Section 4 will investigate which of the three sets of predictions is most consistent with the data. Unpriced disaster risk. We start with a model where disaster is completely unex--5 -pected. In the case of COVID-19, this amounts to assuming that before the first quarter of 2020 financial market participants were unaware of the danger posed by the virus and of its consequences in terms of social distancing. Going forward, a new disaster is again regarded as a zero-probability event, or anyway as being price irrelevant (for instance, in the case of COVID-19, due to development of vaccines and/or effective drugs). In this model, disaster risk would not be priced before COVID-19 nor after it. Such market expectations could result either from bounded rationality, i.e. investors assigning a zero probability weight to a positive probability event, or from a disaster truly having a negligible probability both before and after its occurrence. In the latter case, unpriced disaster risk would be consistent with rational expectations.",

The second model is one where disasters, however rare, are rationally anticipated, so that more resilient firms are priced at a premium relative to less resilient ones, i.e. offer a lower expected return in no-disaster periods, as predicted by Barro (2006) , Barro (2009) and Gabaix (2012) . Such models predict that, in equilibrium, securities more exposed to a disaster, i.e. those issued by less resilient firms, pay a risk premium to compensate investors for this risk. Hence, they predict that (i) prior to the disaster, stocks' excess returns are related to firms' disaster resilience; (ii) during the disaster, investors take into account that the cash flows of less resilient firms drop by more than those of the more resilient ones, so that their disaster-time stock performance is worse; (iii) after the disaster, the pre-disaster excess return pattern re-emerges, i.e. disaster risk remains priced. In principle, this hypothesis does not preclude that investors may update the probability of disasters upon the occurrence of one: if they have increased this probability as a result of COVID-19, the expected return differential between non-resilient and resilient firms should become more pronounced after the pandemics than it was before it.",

Finally, we consider a model where investors learn about the probability of a disaster occurring or about its implications before its occurrence. In the case of COVID-19, as mentioned in the introduction, they may have revised upwards the probability of a pandemic occurring or become more keenly aware of its social distancing implications, for instance as a result of SARS, Ebola, and/or the statements by Bill Gates, Barack Obama and other opinion leaders. By the same token, investors may have become more aware of the characteristics that make firms more resilient to pandemics. Any of these forms of learning implies a demand shift by investors from less to more resilient stocks before the pandemic, leading the latter to outperform the former, once their respective exposures to \"traditional\" risk factors are controlled for. Once disaster strikes, one would again observe the stocks of more resilient firms outperforming less resilient ones. But this pattern should reverse in the post-disaster phase: as at that stage learning would be complete, the stocks of more resilient firms will be priced at a premium relative to less resilient ones, i.e. should offer a lower expected return. This scenario has parallels with learning about the \"importance\" of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scores by investors. In a rational expectations equilibrium without learning, portfolios with strict ESG rules should underperform, but in the presence of gradual learning about the importance of ESG ratings for investors, the stocks of firms with high ESG ratings appreciate, and ESG mutual funds outperform (see Pastor et al., 2020) . Hence, this model predicts that (i) excess returns of resilient relative to nonresilient firms should be observed prior to the disaster; (ii) when disaster strikes, investors take into account that the cash flows of less resilient firms drop by more than those of more resilient ones; (iii) after the disaster, resilient firms offer lower expected returns that non-resilient ones, as learning about disaster risk has taken place.",

To gauge the effect of social distancing on firms, recent research in labor economics has developed measures of the extent to which jobs can be done from home and rely on human interaction in physical proximity. Some studies have developed -7 -such measures starting from worker-level survey responses, while others have done so by characterizing the tasks required by each occupation based on the Occupational Information Network (O*Net) and on the authors' own judgement. Hensvik et al. (2020, HLR) use the first approach: they rely on the 'American Time Use Survey ' (2011-2018) to estimate the prevalence of working at 'home' and at the 'workplace' and, starting from worker-level survey responses, estimate the fraction of employees that work at home and at the workplace, as well as the hours worked at home and at the workplace at the industry-level. 1 Instead, both Dingel and Neiman (2020, DN) and Koren and Pet\u0151 (2020, KP) use data from O*Net surveys. DN use this data, and their own judgement, to assess the teleworkability of occupations and provide industry-level estimates for the percentage of jobs that can be done at home as well as for the percentage of wages associated with teleworkable occupations. KP construct three types of industry-level measures of face-to-face interactions, depending on whether these are due to internal communication ('teamwork'), external communication ('customers'), or physical proximity to others ('presence'). They also aggregate 'teamwork' and 'customers' to a measure of 'communication' intensity and construct an industry-level measure of the percentage of employees 'affected' by social distancing regulations due to their occupations being communication-intensive and/or requiring close physical proximity to others. 2",

            "text": "Since the different performances of the two portfolios shown in Figure 1 may stem from their different exposure to standard risk factors, we estimate CAPM-and FFexposures from daily data in 2019. We then use these exposures to compute daily CAPM-adjusted and FF-adjusted returns, i.e., excess returns net of such exposures multiplied by the respective factor returns (see Subsection 4.1 for details). Figure 2 presents the results: controlling for market factor risk (CAPM-adjusted returns in Panel A), the cumulative return of the High-and Low-resilience portfolio are about +10% and \u221215%, respectively, from February 24 to March 20, i.e. the cumulative CAPM-adjusted High-minus-Low return is approximately 25%. Panels B and C show that accounting for the FF-factors does not change the results qualitatively: the resulting risk-adjusted return differentials are in the range between 15% and 20%. The plots suggest that the differential return between the two portfolios has been negligible from early January until late February, and that the results in the COVID-19 time window are mostly driven by the sharp decline of the Low-resilience portfolio. Once the Fed announced its intervention (on March 23) the High-resilience portfolio recovered slightly and, as a result, the Low-minus-High differential dropped. Interestingly, the time-series of the cumulative Low-minus-High returns resembles that of the Google trends index. Indeed, regressing daily returns on changes in the Google index confirms a statistically significant relation, with R 2 between 0.19 and 0.22, depending on which factor-model adjustment is used. To analyze the statistical significance of these findings, Table 2 reports the averages of daily excess returns (in Column 1) and risk-adjusted returns (in Columns 2 to 6) for High-resilience and Low-resilience stocks from February 24 to March 20, as well as the difference between the two, using the resilience measures based on KP, DN and HLR. Panel A shows that the differential return based on SKP's 'affected share' metric is statistically significant, whether it is based on raw excess returns or adjusted for market exposure (CAPM), for the classic Fama-French factors (FF3 and FF5) or for those that also control for momentum (FF4 and FF6). For resilience measures based on DN (Panel B) and HLR (Panel C) , the average CAPM-adjusted differential returns are statistically significant as well, but there is some variation in the significance of the FF-adjusted returns. A common feature across all resilience measures is that Low-resilience stocks generate (at least marginally) significant negative excess returns in all return specifications. For KP, we additionally find that all risk-adjusted returns of the High-resilience portfolio are significantly positive in all specifications.",

However, in principle investors may have been aware of pandemic risk even before the COVID-19 shock, so that this risk may have to some extent been priced by the stock market in advance. As explained in Section 2, if investors were fully aware of such risk in advance, they should have required lower expected returns on the stocks of pandemic-resilient companies than on those of non-resilient ones, controlling for their respective exposures to other risks. If instead investors had become gradually aware of such risk, one should observe the opposite pattern, namely, the stocks of pandemic-resilient companies outperforming non-resilient ones. Finally, if investors were completely unaware of such risk, one should not detect any difference in the stock market performance of the two types of companies, prior to the pandemic. Figure 4 provides evidence on this point, by displaying the time series pattern of risk-adjusted cumulative returns for High-and Low-resilience stocks for six years before the COVID-19 crisis, as well as for a High-minus-Low-resilience portfolio. 5 Irrespective of the risk adjustment considered (CAPM, FF3 or FF5), the figure shows that High-resilience stocks vastly outperformed Low-resilience ones, with most of the differential return stemming from the outperformance of the former rather than the underperformance of the latter. Moreover, about half of the cumulative risk-adjusted return differential between the two portfolios over the whole interval from 2014 to early 2020 materialized before the COVID-19 crisis, the spike occurring during the crisis accounting for the other half.",

During the Covid-19 crisis, the sign of this premium reverses and its magnitude surges to more than 30% (p.a.) at the peak, as implied by one-month options decreasing with longer maturities to approximately 8% (p.a.) for a forecast horizon of two years. Until the end of March these premia gradually declined to half (interestingly, starting shortly before the reversal in stock prices) and imply, as of March 31, that the stocks of Low-resilience firms are expected to carry a premium of -15 -about 5.5% (p.a.) over the next year and about 4% (p.a.) over the next two years. The results are qualitatively very similar when only large firms (i.e., constituents of the S&P 500) are retained in the sample, although these firms feature lower SVIXlevels, as shown in Figure A .4 of the Appendix.",

First, at the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, all the option-implied expected returns rose, but those of low-resilience stocks (right-side charts) increased by an order of magnitude more than those of lowresilience ones (left-side charts). At the peak of the crisis, the expected return implied by short-term options became an enormous 300% (p.a.) for United Airlines and Royal Caribbean, reflecting unprecedented uncertainty about the immediate future of their businesses. Second, this increase is much more persistent for low-resilience stocks: at the end of our sample, on March 31, their expected returns are still elevated, while for high-resilience stocks they revert back to pre-COVID-19 levels, especially for the two-year horizon. Third, for all stocks expected returns decrease in levels as maturities increase, indicating that there is a term structure to pandemic risk: it is perceived to decrease substantially as the horizon lengthens, though it far from vanishes for low-resilience stocks. Figure 7 provides a clearer view of the time-series patterns of the expected returns of the six stocks, as it adapts the vertical scale of the plot to their range of variation. The figure allows in particular to appreciate that, even at the end of our sample, almost two months after the outbreak, investors still require much higher expected -16 -returns from Marriott, United Airlines and Royal Caribbean than from Apple, Google and Microsoft, and that even at the two-year horizon the expected return is a multiple of what it was at the beginning of the year before the COVID-19 crisis. The most extreme case is Royal Caribbean, whose two-year options imply, as of March 31, an expected return of 60% (p.a.) for a two-year horizon.",

Such differences are massive in the case of some stocks: for example, as late as early April 2020, the expected return on low-resilience stocks such as Royal Caribbean and United Airlines is around 60% and 40% respectively, while those of high-resilience stocks such as Apple and Microsoft are between 3% and 4%.",

The plot labels indicate the industries' 3-digit NAICS codes. The plot legends report results for cross-sectional regressions with t-statistics based on White (1980) ",
