The genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed 96.2% sequence similarity to a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV RaTG13) collected in Yunnan Province, China (1), and 79% and 50% similarities to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), respectively (2). A 91% similarity to pangolin CoV suggested that pangolins can be considered possible hosts in the emergence of the novel coronavirus (3). The 3a protein (NCBI accession number YP_009724391.1) showed 72% sequence similarity to that detected in SARS-CoV (4).",
