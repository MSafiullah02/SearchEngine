This assurance can be obtained by applying the Common Criteria security development process. The process is very difficult and time-consuming specially for those not familiar with the standard. Although there are many guidelines and templates telling how to define the security problem still there is a lack of computer aiding tools. This paper describes the plug-in application which supports identification of protected assets, threats, security objectives and security functions -the main elements of security specification. The tool facilitates and speeds up the security development process of IT products.",

There are devices and systems on the market which can help to protect higher security classified networks. For instance, it could be both software and hardware solutions such as firewalls or smart switches. Among them there is one very interesting and simple-structured hardware device that can prevent data leakage of confidential or classified data. This is the so called data diode which makes one-way link between a high security classified network and a low security classified network [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

Fiber optic technology is used to minimize the electromagnetic radiation of a device by which transmitted data could be eavesdropped. The data diode connection ensures that unwanted access to the protected network is not possible while there is still free access to data sources placed outside. For instance, in the protected zone, anti-virus applications, operating systems, emails can be updated freely by downloading necessary data from public networks (e.g. the Internet) but at the same time no information can be extracted from the protected network. These devices are often used in the defense and infrastructure environments where security is critical. Many of them are compliant with rigorous Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards or regulations established by such organizations as NRC (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission), NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) or NIAP (National Information Assurance Partnership).",

In the result of evaluation a certificate can be issued stating that the target of evaluation (TOE, i.e. a device) fulfilled all requirements congruent with the given Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL). This level tells a user how reliable the security measures built in the evaluated product are. On the EAL basis the user can decide whether to accept the risk of exposing the product to threats or not. According to the standard there are seven levels ranging from EAL1 to EAL7. Most of the certified IT products have middle-ranged levels (EAL3 -EAL4) due to the rising costs of evaluation and development processes at higher levels [9] . However, data diodes have very often higher EALs (EAL4+ or EAL7+) because of their relatively simple hardware structure that does not significantly increase the costs of the evaluation process [10], [11] .",

That solution is described in the Security Target document in terms of security functional requirements (SFRs) which describe how security measures of the TOE should work to effectively counter the identified threats. In order to facilitate choosing the most suitable functional requirements for the given security objectives, the SFR components are divided into 11 classes referring to such security issues as: security audit, communication, cryptographic support, user data protection, identification and authentication, security management, privacy, protection of the TSFs (TOE security functions), resource utilization, TOE access, trusted path/channels. These functional security requirements are next implemented into the device in the form of security functions during the TOE development process. These functions are also developed according to the security assurance requirements (SARs) of the claimed EAL.",

So it is important to precisely identify all assets that have to be protected by the TOE and to identify all entities which interact with the TOE. For the above mentioned example of the certified data diode -FFHDD the protected asset is the sensitive information on the High Security Level network. The entities which can use this information can be authorized or not, and can be users or processes e.g.: an administrator, a user, a hacker, an update service. The threat unit describes the threats that are to be countered by the TOE, its operational environment, or combination of the two. A threat definition consists of an adverse action performed by a threat agent on an asset. In the example of the FFHDD device the threat T.TRANSFER was defined as \"A user or process on the High Security Level network that accidentally or deliberately breaches the confidentiality of some High Security Level information by transmitting data through the TOE to the Low Security Level network\". The next unit of ST shows OSPs which are security rules, procedures, or guidelines imposed by an organization to the TOE or to the operational environment of the TOE. No OSPs were defined for the FFHDD product but an example of OSP can be a statement \"Only users with system administrator privilege shall be allowed to set up and manage the data diode connection system\". The last unit of ST shows assumptions that are made on the operational environment in order to make it secure enough for the TOE. In such an environment the TOE is able to provide all its security functionalities without disruptions. Assumptions can be made on physical, personnel and connectivity aspects of the operational environment. In the case of FFHDD the following assumptions were defined: A.PHYSICAL \"The intended operation environment shall store and operate the TOE in accordance with the requirements of the High Security Level side\"; A.NETWORK \"The TOE is the only method of interconnecting the Low Security Level network and High Security Level network. This prevents a threat agent from circumventing the security being provided by the TOE through an untrustworthy product\".

The second set shows the goals that the operational environment should achieve, e.g. for FFHDD: OE.PHYSICAL \"The intended operation environment shall be capable of storing and operating the TOE in accordance with the requirements of the High Security Level side\"; OE.NETWORK \"The TOE is the only method of interconnecting the Low Security Level network and High Security Level network\".

The first group is made up from functional components taken from Part 2 of the CC standard and the second group are assurance components taken from Part 3 of the CC standard according to the claimed EAL (here EAL4+ for FFHDD). The SARs determine the range and details of the TOE development and security evaluation processes which are not in the focus of this paper. The SFRs are next implemented in the TOE security functions. In the example of FFHDD two functional components were selected which fulfill the TOE security objective for confidentiality: FDP_IFC.2 Complete Information Flow Control (FDP class -user data protection, IFC family -information flow control policy); FDP_IFF.1 Simple Security Attributes (IFF family -information flow control functions). Generally speaking these components permit the TOE security function to transmit sensitive information only from input (Low Security Level network) to output (High Security Level network) and not vice versa. The choice of proper SFRs is very difficult and depends on the developer's experience and knowledge of the CC standard. Therefore there could be a vast potential demand for supporting this part of ST elaboration. The security requirements elaboration is finalized by their rationale. Next these requirements should be implemented in the TOE security functions which are described in the last section of ST -TOE summary specification (TSS).",

The system integrates: modules of the development environment management, design patterns, knowledge base, evaluation methodology, and external supporting software. Among the external applications there is the Enterprise Architect (EA) of the Sparx platform which was used as a basis for modeling, development and security analyses made in UML (Unified Modeling Language). In the CCMODE project a special plug-in for EA was worked out. The plug-in uses basic features of EA system and UML in order to support users in defining the TOE security problem and next in solving that problem by selecting security objectives and functional security requirements (SFRs). At the beginning of the CCMODE project the survey of UML software development environments was made. As a result, EA was chosen as the most convenient and easy platform for third-party software implementations. The EA system is a rather cheap solution, known by many IT developers, which enables implementation of additional plug-ins in the form of DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) files. The EA system uses a database which is open and accessible to programmers so it is quite easy for them to build their own tables for the purposes of potential plug-ins. The EA producer also expressed preliminary agreement to offer the plug-in for their customers. Firstly, the model of the plug-in was made in UML on the basis of functional requirements proposed by IT products developers. The database structure was modeled for the ST documents sections data. The toolbox of graphical objects for building elements of SPD and ST sections was worked out. The toolbox contains objects of assets, security objectives, assumptions, threats, security functions and requirements, and connectors for making relations between them. The objects have dialog windows which are connected to the knowledge base of the CCMODE Tools system. On that basis special wizards windows and inferring procedures were worked out.",

The knowledge base comprises the guidelines that help to resolve typical security problems with the use of predefined security objectives, threats, assumptions, and security policies. The predefined elements of SPD and its solutions are connected by relations through the database in order to make the lists of proposed security objectives and SFRs shorter. These relations are the result of analyses made in the CCMODE project concerning dozens of STs and PPs, templates and guidelines describing how to define and solve the security problem. The last steps of the plug-in development process were verification and validation of a prototype software tool in some ST projects of IT devices.",
