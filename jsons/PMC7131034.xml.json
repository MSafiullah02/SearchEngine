Hence, some of our motivation for introducing the new system is simply to better manage traffic. In-house research has determined that increasing the number of submissions is key to improving journal quality. It is no coincidence that recent improvements in the Proceedings impact factor (ISI, Thomson ISI, Philadelphia, Pa)2 are tightly coupled to the numbers of submissions. Although less tightly coupled, changes in journal readership, as assessed by PERQ/HCI Research (Princeton, NJ),2 are also related to the number of submissions.",

At the time this editorial will go to press, we project an average first-response-to-authors time of 5.8 weeks in 2004, or a 45% reduction from the 10.6 weeks recorded during our 1998 baseline year. Much of the current review time is spent contacting reviewers and sending hard copies of articles to them to review. Absent fundamental alterations in our review logistics, these manual-processing delays will limit our ability to further reduce minimal review time. We believe that, from this point forward, improved processing time is possible only by migrating to electronic submissions. We anticipate that days formerly lost with telephone calls, mailings, and faxes can now be reduced substantially.",

With the introduction of ScholarOne's Manuscript Central system, submission and review times involving international authors and reviewers should be as rapid as those received from authors and reviewers from within the United States. Hence, we can anticipate increasingly diverse input from experts from around the globe as a result of expanded electronic communications.",

Perhaps this is why the journal has had 6 different names to date, of which the first 4 were forced into the journal's first 10 months of operations. Throughout the past 8 decades, the journal's name and mission have probably been in best agreement with the introduction of the self-explanatory title, Proceedings of the Weekly Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic, in January 1927, and later Mayo Clinic Proceedings in January 1964. The latter title was intended to imply that content was provided by Mayo Clinic authors and reflected their clinical experiences.",
