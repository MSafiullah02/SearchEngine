He had numbness on both legs that lasted for hours and resolved. He had no backache, and no arm, facial, or visual symptoms. He denied sphincteric or flu-like symptoms. He had a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Two days before admission he could walk miles. He was swabbed in the emergency department (ED) for COVID 19 due to chronic unchanged cough and was admitted to a COVID 19 ward. His test was positive, so further investigations were deferred until he recovers from COVID 19 or deteriorates.",

He had distal lower limb weakness and hyporeflexia without back pain or sensory level, suggestive of peripheral neuropathy. However, he had no preceding flu like illness and his symptoms were worst at onset and progressively got, making it less likely to be GBS. Uncontrolled diabetes and alcohol could account for absent reflexes, but not for weakness as it was of an acute onset. There was no evidence of spinal infarction or acute stroke on MRI. The diagnosis is likely a motor peripheral neuropathy, though we could not further characterise it as the patient did not have a lumbar puncture or nerve conduction studies which were unsafe to do in view of his COVID 19 status.",
