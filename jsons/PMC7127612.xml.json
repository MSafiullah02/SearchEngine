Resistance is due to allelic variation in the gene encoding carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) [4]. Susceptible strains carry the Ceacam1a allele, which encodes the principal MHV receptor, CEACAM1a. Resistant strains, such as SJL, are homozygous for the Ceacam1b allele, which encodes a 27-amino-acid substitution in the N-terminal virus-binding domain of CEACAM1a [4]. An immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (see Glossary) is present in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1, also suggesting a potential immunomodulatory function for this molecule during MHV infection. Although no role for human CEACAM1a has been described during viral infection of humans [5], a possible immunomodulatory function is consistent with the observation of a CEACAM1-mediated suppression of CD4+ T-cell activation during infection by the pathogenic bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. These human pathogens bind to domain 1 of CEACAM1, very close to the site recognized by MHV [6].",

            "text": "Another example of natural host resistance is the restriction of ecotropic Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) infection by the mouse Fv4 gene. Binding of retroviral Env glycoproteins to cellular receptors triggers fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and allows the virus nucleocapsid to enter the cell. The Fv4 (or Akvr) locus is a defective endogenous ecotropic provirus that encodes an Env protein, which also has a fusion defect 7, 8. It has been proposed that the Env protein encoded by Fv4 blocks MuLV infection by interacting with the cellular receptor and restricting the amount of receptor available for exogenous retrovirus attachment (Box 1\n) [9].Box 1Box 1. Resistance to retroviral infectionAn important element of resistance to retroviral infection is provided by endogenous retroviral elements. Some retroviral elements in the mammalian genome are transcriptionally active but carry deletions and point mutations that render them unable to replicate. Some of their gene products, such as the FV4 and FV1 proteins, interfere with infection by their exogenous relatives thus providing a selective advantage to their hosts. For example, Fv4 encodes an Env protein that interferes with ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) infection (see main text) at the level of viral entry. Examples of this phenomenon can be found in mice, chickens and cats, suggesting that Env-mediated retroviral interference is commonly used for limiting virus spread [76]. Gene therapy based on the principle of receptor interference has demonstrated that introduction of Fv4-Env-transduced bone marrow cells into a thymectomized host confers resistance to Friend leukemia virus-induced leukemogenesis [77]. These findings suggest that a similar approach could be used as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit infections by other retroviruses in vivo, including immunodeficiency virus. For example, transfer of a gene encoding a normally processed but fusion-defective retroviral Env protein into susceptible cells would interfere with viral entry and potentially reduce the infectiousness of viruses emerging from the cell.The Fv1 locus 78, 79 encodes a retrovirus capsid-like protein [80] that restricts MuLV infection at a post-entry stage, before integration of the provirus [81]. Because all retroviruses replicate in very similar ways, it is conceivable that similar restriction mechanisms could be found in humans. Interestingly, although an Fv1 ortholog was not detected in nonmurine species, a mechanism of preintegration interference, resistance factor 1 (REF1), has been demonstrated in human cell lines [82]. At the time of writing, the REF1 gene has not been cloned, but there is speculation that, like Fv1, REF1 might consist of endogenous retroviral sequences. A recent study suggests the existence of a REF1-like restriction in humans and nonhuman primates that determines lentivirus tropism [83]. Consistent with this proposal, the target for this restriction is within the capsid protein of HIV [83].An example of an alternative mechanism of resistance to retroviral infection is provided by Fv2, which determines the progression of Friend virus complex-induced erythroleukemia. Fv2 is identical to Ron, which encodes STK, a member of the MET family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Susceptible mice express a positive-acting truncated version of STK lacking most of the extracellular domain, which is associated with proliferation of SFFV-infected erythroblasts [84].",

CD4 is the primary or \u2018attachment\u2019 receptor for HIV, but CD4 is necessary but not sufficient for the productive entry of HIV into target cells. The identification of CCR5 as a coreceptor for HIV prompted genetic screening of individuals that escape HIV disease despite high-risk behavior [10]. Individuals carrying a homozygous 32 bp deletion in the coding sequence of CCR5 (CCR5\u039432) are extremely resistant to the \u2018R5\u2019 strain of HIV because the deletion results in a frame shift and generates a nonfunctional receptor [10]. The CCR5\u039432 mutation is found predominantly in the Caucasian population and is absent in Africans, American Indians and East Asians [11]. It has been speculated that this distribution is consistent with resistance to an agent that predates HIV and caused enormous mortality. One candidate is Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, although other pathogens targeting the macrophage/monocyte lineage cannot be excluded [12].",

The inbred mouse strain A2G is resistant to doses of mouse-adapted influenza virus (an orthomyxovirus) that are lethal for other inbred strains [13]. Resistance in these mice is determined by a single dominant locus, Mx1, whose gene product, MX1, rapidly accumulates in the nuclei of cells following influenza virus infection, and blocks virus spread [14]. Susceptible mice produce no functional MX protein due to either a nonsense mutation (CBA/J) or gene deletion (BALB/c) [15]. The Mx1 product belongs to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases conserved in all vertebrates. In mice there are actually two Mx gene products, MX1 and MX2. MX1 protein blocks transcription of influenza virus, probably via interaction with the PB2 subunit of the influenza virus polymerase [16]. By contrast, the MX2 protein is cytoplasmic and has been shown to inhibit viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and members of the family Bunyaviridae\n[14]. MX proteins inhibit virus replication by interfering with the transport of viral nucleocapsids, and by sorting them to locations where they become unavailable for the generation of new virus particles [14], possibly to promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs) [17], which are known to be a site of proteasome-mediated degradation.",

Virus titers in the brains of resistant mice infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus or West Nile virus are orders of magnitude lower than in susceptible animals. Viral yields in tissue cultured from resistant or susceptible animals are also dramatically different, indicating that the Flv gene product acts intracellularly on flavivirus replication [18]. Genetic mapping localized Flv1 to chromosome 5 [19] and, more recently, it was demonstrated that Flv susceptibility is associated with a nonsense mutation in a member of the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, Oas1b\n20, 21. OAS proteins are induced by IFNs and play a central role in producing the antiviral state by binding double-stranded RNA and catalyzing the synthesis of 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates (2-5A), which, in turn, interact with and activate RNase L to degrade single-stranded viral and cellular RNAs. Whereas Oas1b genes from resistant mice encode full-length proteins, those from susceptible mice encode proteins truncated at the C-terminus that might not form active synthetases. In contrast to the single OAS1 gene found in humans, there are eight closely linked Oas1 genes in the murine genome 20, 22, but only Oas1b is associated with resistance to flaviviruses.",

            "text": "Herpesviruses avoid recognition and activation of the adaptive immune system by downregulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on infected cells. However, class I downregulation renders the infected cell susceptible to recognition by NK cells expressing inhibitory receptors, in accordance with the \u2018missing self\u2019 hypothesis of Karre et al.\n[23]. Viruses such as mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) have upped the ante in their battle against the immune system by deploying MHC class I homologs, such as m144, which confer resistance to the innate immune response by inhibiting NK-cell-mediated attack (Box 2) [24]. Strains of the C57BL background carry a dominant resistance allele, Cmv1\nr, that restricts viral replication in target organs, whereas other mouse strains carry a recessive susceptibility allele, Cmv1\ns, that allows rapid proliferation of the virus [25]. Cmv1\nr encodes an activating NK-cell receptor, Ly49H 26, 27, 28, which is absent in susceptible strains. Mouse strains express different repertoires of Ly49 molecules, which are part of a large family of polymorphic receptors expressed on overlapping populations of NK cells. Upon binding of MHC class I ligands, different Ly49 molecules deliver either activating or inhibitory signals that modulate NK-cell function [29]. Recent studies have revealed that Ly49H recognizes MCMV-infected cells via direct interaction with the viral antigen, m157, which shares structural homology with MHC class I molecules and is expressed on the surface of infected cells 30, 31. m157 also binds to an inhibitory receptor, Ly49I, expressed in susceptible strain 129 mice, suggesting that m157 could have evolved as a mechanism to escape NK-cell killing by targeting inhibitory receptors [30]. In resistant mice, Ly49H might have evolved as a countermeasure against virus-encoded MHC class I homologs, providing an overriding activating signal to the NK cell, and promoting the elimination of MCMV-infected cells (Fig. 2a). Considering the prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the human population, we expect that there are likely to be HCMV-specific activating receptors present on human leukocytes that might function in a manner analogous to Ly49H.",

MHC class I genes play a crucial role in combating viral infection in mice (Fig. 3a). Congenic mice with intra-MHC recombinations provide an important tool for dissecting the contribution of MHC class I subregions to virus infection. For example, comparisons of T-cell responses in H2 congenic mice that differ in their recovery from Friend leukemia virus infection were used to localize Friend leukemia virus resistance loci Rfv1 and Rfv2. Rfv1 mapped to the H2D subregion and determined T-cell activation. Rfv2 mapped to the IA subregion and determined unresponsiveness of T cells in a proliferation assay [35]. Resistance to acute lethal infection of MCMV is also controlled by genes linked to H2, with the k haplotype being more resistant than b or d. Resistance was associated with genes of subregions K/IA and D. Interestingly in this model, transfection of macrophages with sequences encoding MHC molecules such as H2-Kd, Dd or Kb renders these cells, which are major reservoirs for MCMV, sensitive to MCMV infection [37], consistent with a role for MHC molecules as MCMV receptors.",

The study of infectious disease under complex genetic control in humans is complicated by a variety of factors including genetic heterogeneity, low penetrance and environmental factors. The tools currently available to the mouse geneticist make the identification and isolation of disease susceptibility genes much more attainable. An example is the response to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a rodent model for multiple sclerosis [52]. In genetically susceptible mice, certain TMEV strains cause persistent infection, inflammation, and a chronic demyelinating disease. One of the loci determining Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus persistence (Tmevp1), maps to the MHC region and corresponds to the H2D gene [52]. Mice transgenic for the H2D\nb allele acquired resistance to persistent virus infection, suggesting that the gene effect was at the level of peptide presentation by H2Db\n[53]. Using the amount of viral RNA in the spinal cords of persistently infected mice as a phenotype, and a genetic dissection strategy based on genome scans, a second locus, Tmevp2, was localized near the type II interferon (IFN-\u03b3) gene on distal chromosome 10 [54]. Analysis of a panel of congenic mice that inherited different portions of mouse chromosome 10 revealed that Tmevp2 was actually two distinct loci, now termed Tmevp2 and Tmevp3, and excluded the IFN-\u03b3 gene from the candidate region [55]. Recently, a strong candidate for Tmevp3, named Tmevpg1, has been identified as a noncoding RNA expressed in immune cells infiltrating the central nervous system of resistant mice, where an inverse relationship with IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels has been observed [56], suggesting a role for this RNA in regulating IFN-\u03b3 synthesis. Consistent with this observation, the same reciprocal pattern of RNA expression was observed for TMEVPG1, the human counterpart, and IFN-\u03b3 in human NK cells and T cells.",

The well-defined sets of recombinant congenic strains (RCS) [57], consomic (chromosome substitution) strains\n[58] and advanced intercrossed lines\n[59] that are now available can be used to map a locus of interest and to characterize the specific phenotypic component of disease susceptibility under genetic control. Also, traditional genetic mapping techniques are now complemented by high-throughput methods for studying gene function and regulation. For example, high-density oligonucleotide arrays [60] or cDNA arrays [61] allow for gene expression monitoring on a genome-wide scale and offer an opportunity to establish functional links between genotype and phenotype. A strategy that combines congenic mapping with microarray expression profiling would aid in the identification of novel susceptibility genes and biochemical pathways not previously known to be involved in disease etiology. Furthermore, the availability of the human and mouse genome sequences represents the ultimate breakthrough in quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies by placing the identification of candidate genes within a defined genetic interval only a (computer) mouse click away.",

Therefore, although these resources are valuable, they do not permit the identification of all possible resistance or susceptibility loci. Wild-derived inbred strains of mice are an important source of additional resistance alleles [63] that is just beginning to be exploited, as demonstrated by the characterization of Flv. Chemical mutagenesis, a method that has been successfully applied to the study of other model organisms, from bacteria to Drosophila, is another promising strategy for creating novel susceptibility alleles in the mouse. The alkylating agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) introduces point mutations and creates random variation throughout the genome [64]. This is highly advantageous for defining host susceptibility phenotypes because it represents an unbiased method for identifying previously unrecognized physiological pathways because no assumptions are made about the relevant genes. ENU mutagenesis yields models of simple inheritance that are readily accessible to analysis by positional cloning [64].",

Important questions to be answered include: (1) Do other activating NK-cell receptors have specialized functions in virus recognition? (2) Is the MHC class I fold a recognition-associated structure? (3) What is the extent of the repertoire of target molecules for NK-cell-activating receptors? In addition, studies of mouse NK-cell receptors, such as the Ly49 family, have provided a conceptual framework for understanding human NK-cell biology. Because no functional human Ly49 counterpart has been identified, prime candidates for the recognition of viral pathogens by human NK cells are members of the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family [65]. Although the ligands of activating KIR receptors remain to be identified, it has been proposed that activating KIR molecules have evolved to recognize infectious agents (Fig. 2b) [32].",

The recognition of the m157 protein by the activating Ly49H receptor provides the first example of direct recognition of a virally encoded molecule by an NK-cell receptor. Ly49H associates with the adaptor molecule DAP12 through a charged arginine residue in its transmembrane domain. DAP12 possesses an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain that serves as a docking site for Syk and Zap70 protein tyrosine kinases. Upon Ly49H binding to m157, a cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation is initiated leading to cellular activation and perforin-mediated killing of the virus-infected cell. (b) Proposed NK-cell recognition and killing of HIV-infected cells in humans. Human killer-cell immunoglobulin-type receptor (KIR) is considered to be a functional homolog of mouse Ly49. An epistatic interaction between KIR3DS1 and HLA-B delays progression to AIDS, suggesting that HLA-B behaves as a ligand for KIR3DS1 [32]. The peptide presented on HLA-B that is responsible for this interaction remains to be identified.
