The virus is transmitted via the faeco-oral route and preferentially infects rapidly dividing cells, showing a tropism for small intestinal epithelium, lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and occasionally the myocardium if the puppy is less than three weeks of age (Prittie, 2004). Death of myeloproliferative cells and thymic lymphocytolysis causes immunosuppression. Malabsorption, vomiting and diarrhoea from damaged intestinal lining and villous atrophy, can rapidly progress to shock and death due to continual fluid and protein losses, bacterial sepsis and endotoxaemia. Occasionally myocarditis or pneumonia is observed (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010).",

This may be due to failure of passive transfer of antibodies via colostrum, incomplete or ineffective primary vaccination course, or failure of vaccination to induce immunity because of interference by maternal antibodies (Smith-Carr et al., 1997). Unvaccinated puppies aged between six weeks and six months are at greatest risk of developing CPV-related disease, and the incidence of disease is also greater in the warmer months of the year (Godsall et al., 2010, Horner, 1983, Smith-Carr et al., 1997).

Surveillance of the canine population for infectious disease in Australia is rare, and most examples of surveillance systems elsewhere have focussed on zoonotic diseases, notably rabies and parasitic infections (Trichuris, Isospora, Toxascaris, Ancylostoma and Toxocara). In January 2010 Virbac Animal Health in Australia launched Disease WatchDog, a national companion animal health surveillance system (Ward and Kelman, 2011). The aim was to provide information on occurrence, transmission and risk factors for CPV-related disease (and other infectious diseases in dogs and cats). This surveillance project has provided the first dataset of information available on the epidemiology of CPV infection in Australia. The aim of the current study was to estimate the case fatality rate for canine parvoviral-related disease in Australia during the period 1st January to 31st December 2010, and to identify those risk factors \u2013 including age, sex, vaccination status, pedigree type, reproductive status, season and state of residence \u2013 associated with death. These factors can be used as prognostic indicators by veterinarians when treating diagnosed CPV cases, as well as providing insights into the effectiveness of current vaccination practices.",

False positives may occur if the test is performed four to ten days following administration of a modified-live vaccine (the test is unable to discriminate between field and vaccine antigens). The presence of vaccine antigen in the faeces is likely due to the replication of live vaccine virus within lymphoid tissue or epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent faecal shedding of antigen (Lamm and Rezabek, 2008, Patterson et al., 2007, Pollock and Coyne, 1993). This issue is most relevant for puppies receiving their primary course of vaccinations, since vaccination and susceptibility to CPV infection occur concurrently.",

It is plausible that this might also be occurring in Australia, resulting in differences between strains present in particular geographical areas. Subsequently, there might be reduced protection from maternally derived antibodies and reduced effectiveness of vaccination, whereby immunonaivety to newly evolving strains in particular states may increase susceptibility to infection and reduce a dog's ability to mount an effective immune response against the virus. Consequentially, there would be greater infection severity and higher death rates (Lamm and Rezabek, 2008).

For CPV, the presence of susceptible hosts depends largely on the proportion of animals that are vaccinated, since vaccination has proven efficacy in protecting dogs against infection with field strains (Truyen, 2006). It could be hypothesised that geographical regions with low herd immunity experience greater disease severity and higher case fatality rates, however, this has not been documented (Woolhouse et al., 1997).

Different antigenic CPV strains have varied clinical effects based on animal signalment, immunocompetence, viral dosage and route of transmission, hence it is plausible that the CPV-2a strain in Australia may overall be more virulent and produce more severe disease than the 2b and 2c strains. If this were true, infection in immunonaive dogs in Australia (most likely due to either lack of adequate vaccination or vaccine failure due to interference with maternal antibodies) may be more likely to result in death from CPV than infection in immunonaive dogs elsewhere, resulting in a higher overall case fatality rate (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010, Lamm and Rezabek, 2008).

Pedigree dogs have previously been reported to be at increased risk of developing CPV compared to mixed breed dogs, however, results of the current study showed that once infected, there was a similar prognosis for survival between mixed breed and pedigree dogs (Kalli et al., 2010). However, there was a significant effect within pedigree dogs: the highest case fatality rates were estimated for hounds, non-sporting dogs and gundogs, and the lowest fatality rates were estimated for terriers and working dogs. This trend may be due to differences in immune competence between specific breeds as immunological nonresponsiveness is thought to be controlled genetically, although interestingly pedigree types at greater risk of death in this study do not correlate with those specific breeds previously reported to be at greatest risk of CPV infection (Rottweiler, Doberman pinscher, German shepherd, American pit bull terrier, Labrador retriever, Springer spaniel, and Yorkshire terrier) (Day, 1999, Glickman et al., 1985, Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010, Godsall et al., 2010, Smith-Carr et al., 1997). An estimated 0.1% of dogs in general are non-responsive to CPV vaccines and whilst this lack of response is genetically controlled it is seen across breeds (Welbon et al., 2011).

One explanation is selection bias: if more severe clinical cases are reported and if these cases are also more likely to have vaccination status recorded within Disease Watchdog, this could result in vaccination status appearing as less of a risk factor. Equally, this finding may simply demonstrate the multifactorial nature of this disease, with other factors such as co-infection, stress, parasites and nutrition, potentially influencing the outcome in these cases. Vaccination against CPV with a live attenuated vaccine is reported to prevent the development of clinical signs, reduce viral shedding, limit disease severity and reduce hospitalisation time, all together resulting in significantly lower case fatality rates in vaccinated dogs compared to unvaccinated dogs (Meunier et al., 1985, Spibey et al., 2008). These patterns were not found in the present study (Table 1): there was no significant difference in case fatality rates between dogs that were unvaccinated (16.4%) and those dogs that had received a vaccination within the previous 12 months. Age should be considered as a potential confounding factor for this result; however, the majority (89.5%) of dogs that had a history of vaccination within the previous 12 months that developed disease due to CPV were less than 12 months of age. In addition, exposure to parvovirus was not measured in this study and might account for the lack of association between veterinary clinic reported vaccination status and risk of parvovirus death.

This result questions the typical presentation of a parvovirus case as an unvaccinated animal, and indicates that CPV should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any dog presenting with vomiting or diarrhoea regardless of vaccination status. Of these 38 cases, 23 (60.5%) contracted CPV within 14 days of the last vaccination. The incubation period for CPV is three to seven days and it takes up to two weeks for dogs to establish protective immunity following vaccination depending on the success of previous boosters in the primary series; hence it is plausible that a proportion of these cases developed disease due to an insufficient time interval between vaccination and exposure to CPV (Day et al., 2010). This possibility highlights the need to keep puppies isolated from other dogs and parvovirus-contaminated public areas until at least two weeks following the final vaccination to allow sufficient immunity to develop prior to potential exposure. In addition a small proportion of the cases diagnosed within 14 days of vaccination may represent false positive test results in the CPV faecal antigen test, due to the inability of the test to discriminate between field and modified-live vaccine antigens for four to ten days following vaccination (Lamm and Rezabek, 2008, Patterson et al., 2007, Pollock and Coyne, 1993).",

This finding largely points towards failure of the primary puppy course of vaccinations to provide protective immunity. It is recommended that the final vaccine in the puppy course be given at 14\u201316 weeks, since at this age maternal antibodies are reported to have declined to a level at which vaccination should be effective in allowing development of acquired immunity to protect against field infection (Day et al., 2010). However, it is plausible that a small percentage of puppies at this age still have maternally derived antibodies capable of inactivating the vaccine antigen. This means that a large window of opportunity for infection exists in these particular dogs as maternal antibodies continue to decline below protective levels and their next vaccination is not for another 12 months. This trend certainly is an argument against the \u2018early finish\u2019 vaccination protocol, in which the final primary puppy vaccination is given at 10 or 12 weeks of age (Day et al., 2010). It may even be pertinent to consider a later finish for the final primary vaccination than at 14\u201316 weeks of age, in order to ensure those puppies with prolonged maternal immunity are able to fully respond to vaccination. Alternatively, the presence of CPV in vaccinated dogs may result from vaccination failure due to vaccine, procedural or patient factors. Vaccination of immunocompromised dogs may also be a cause of vaccine failure, due to the inability of the immune system to mount an effective response against the vaccine antigen. As discussed earlier, genetic non-responder state is thought to occur in 0.1% of dogs and may account for some of these cases in this study.",

One explanation is selection bias: if more severe clinical cases of parvovirus are reported within Disease Watchdog, and these cases over-represent older age categories within the source population, an age effect might not have been detected. Humoral immunity does not reach full adult capacity until one year of age in dogs: adult levels of serum IgM are reached at two to three months of age, adult serum IgG levels are not reached until six to nine months of age, and adult serum IgA levels are often not present until one year of age (Felsburg, 2002). Cell-mediated immunity is also compromised in younger animals, as adult numbers and proportions of T and B lymphocytes are not reached until 12 months of age (Day, 2007). This immaturity of humoral and cell-mediated immunity is thought to compromise the ability of younger animals to respond to immunogenic challenge, thereby resulting in increased severity of infection and higher case fatality rate from infectious disease in animals less than 12 months of age. In this study, however, prognosis for survival from CPV related disease was similar for non-litter dogs regardless of age, which may point towards a high level of virulence of Australian CPV strains.",
