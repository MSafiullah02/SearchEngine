The available knowledge on the viral genomics, molecular biology and pathogenicity of viruses of the Coronaviridae family and other Nidovirales, forms a helpful template for understanding the present pandemic outbreak. However, important questions remain unanswered about the underlying mechanism causing the very high case fatality ratios (CFR) and mechanisms regarding severe reactions like ARDS, fatal cardiac and renal failures, associated with a number of important comorbidity factors. Immunological reactions to lung alveoles in particular (involving lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cell damage) in late phase ARDS in SARS-like CoV diseases, so far may not have received enough attention. Finally a shortlist of questions for high priority further research is suggested.",

This relationship is confirmed by 96% genomic similarity of the full-length genome sequence of the COVID-19 virus with a SARS-like coronavirus strain derived from Rhinolophus bat (BatCoV RaTG13) (WHO 2020). Only recently it was shown that genomic recombination from the Chinese Greater Horseshoe bat (R. sinicus) was at the onset of the SARS outbreak (Lau et al. 2015) . Similar to the SARS outbreak of [2002] [2003] , the viral tropism towards the respiratory system is striking, but the timing of the highly infective phases of the disease are also very different from SARS. The very high human-to-human infectivity of COVID-19 and resulting pneumonia, has been documented following close surveillance of pneumonia in a family cluster, early during the Wuhan epidemic (Chan et al. 2020) .",

It has been known for a while that ACE2 is involved in acute lung injury in mice (Imai et al. 2008 ) and that ACE2 is a receptor of the spike (S) glycoprotein of both Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-2)-also a Betacoronavirus causing virulent pneumonia-and SARS-related CoV (Weiss and Leibowitz 2011) . The importance of this ACE2 receptor for cellular infectivity of the virus is strengthened by the finding that no amino acid substitutions have been found in the corresponding genome region of 2019-nCoV, compared with the receptor-binding motifs that directly interact with human ACE2 as recognized in the SARS-CoV genome (Wu et al. 2020) . Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that 2019-nCoV uses the same ACE2 receptor-similar to the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2-and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells (Hoffmann et al. 2020) . Moreover, ACE2 expression is very predominant in both Type 1 and Type 2 alveolar pneumocytes of the human lung, as well as in the intestine and kidney (Turner 2015) .",

            "text": "In contrast to the former examples of Betacoronaviruses (MHV-2, SARSrCoV and 2019 nCoV), in the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Toosy and O'Sullivan 2017) a different cell entry of the MERS-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered: namely the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) (Raj et al. 2013) . The epidemiology of MERS is quite different from that seen in SARS (Toosy and O'Sullivan 2017) and also from COVID-19. The receptor for viral entry, DPP4 (CD26) is for instance expressed in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Moreover, DPP4 is expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells of most human organ tissues (in ex vivo studies using human culture lines), suggesting this may account for the multisystem clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection (Turner 2015) . Although also MERS has been associated with a coronavirus lineage present in Vesper bats (in particular Pipistrellus hesperidus, Vespertilionidae) in Uganda, there was a high divergence of the S protein nucleotide sequence compared with a MERS-CoV S protein sequence (Anthony et al. 2017) . This suggests that the viruses are different and-although bats are the plausible evolutionary source of MERS CoV-another intermediate mammalian reservoir species is probably responsible for transmission of MERS to humans (Turner 2015) . This appears to be the wild population of Dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in North and East Africa. It is suggested that the limited geographic distribution of MERS-CoV is related to the distribution of these dromedary camels (DCs). When DCs are infected, MERS-CoV causes only a mild, transient upper respiratory tract disease (Turner 2015) .",

            "text": "Genomic analysis of the 2019-nCoV and closely related coronaviruses already has revealed a number of important differences (Wu et al. 2020) . In order to understand the impact of these differences on pathogenicity and epidemiology, it is important to have access to the genomic structure of the virus RNA (See Fig. 1a ) (Wu et al. 2020 ; International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2012). First a distinction is made in genes coding for structural (glyco)proteins (Fig. 2) forming a common backbone in many groups of the Nidovirales: these include the spike glycoprotein (S), the membrane glycoprotein (M), the envelope protein (E), the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE). However, the latter HE is absent from both SARSr human CoV, and from SARSr bat CoV as well as from 2019-nCoV (Wu et al. 2020) (Fig. 1b) . In other members of the Betacoronavirus genus, like in Human coronavirus HKU1 (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2012), HE is important for reversible attachment of virions to O-acetylated sialic acids, by acting both as a lectin and as a sialate-O-acetylesterase. This however is not the case in neither SARS nor 2019-nCoV. Also for the relatively innocuous Human coronavirus OC43 (causing only a mild cold), it is suggested that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is the primary attachment factor, and not the ACE2 receptor (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2012). Sialic acid plays an important role in cellular recognition and ganglioside metabolism, and is found as a common modification at the outside of glycoproteins. For instance, the 9-O-acetylation of these sialoglycans has been shown to play a role in host-pathogen interactions with functional implications in the immune system (like impaired binding of influenza A and B, but at the same time creating a receptor for influenza C) (Baumann et al. 2015) .",

In the so-called open reading frames (ORF 1ab and ORF 1a), both situated at the 5\u2032-terminus of the genome of 2019-nCoV-as well as in most Betacoronavirus genomes-, a number of non-structural proteins (nsps) are encoded (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2012) (Fig. 1a) . In 2019-nCoV the first ORF represents 67% of the entire genome, being transcribed into so-called polyproteins that are further processed into 16 nsps (Wu et al. 2020) . Beside a number of differences in the nsps encoding ORF, also in the eight so-called accessory proteins that are encoded in ORF's near the 3\u2032 end of the genome, important differences have been noted between 2019-nCoV and SARS-like coronaviruses (Wu et al. 2020 ).

            "text": "The pathogenic effects of coronavirus entry using the ACE2 receptor in for instance lung epithelial cells appear to follow two paths: on the one hand, spikereceptor interaction causes downregulation and abolishment of the protective function of ACE2, resulting in local enhancement of angiotensin II production and unrestricted stimulation of the angiotensin receptor (AT 1 R) (Imai et al. 2008) (Fig. 3) . On the other hand, the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein induces so-called syncytia-formation and transformation into large multinucleated cells, as observed in clinical SARS infections (Imai et al. 2008 ) and also in post mortem samples taken from a 50-year old male patient from Wuhan (WHO 2020). It was already suggested that severe lung damage, especially in the late phase of SARS, was largely 'immunopathological in nature' (Weiss and Leibowitz 2011) . In early phase fatal lung disease, histological examination showed hyaline membrane formation (indicative of ARDS) (World Health Organization 2020) and loss of lung epithelial cells (or pneumocytes), resulting alveolar damage and mixed cellular infiltrates of lymphocytes (Weiss and Leibowitz 2011) . Often also multinucleated giant cells, carrying markers for both macrophages and pneumocytes were present (Weiss and Leibowitz 2011) , indicating the involvement of macrophage scavenging. Also in 2019-nCoV infections, these histological features were observed in post mortem specimen from lung (apart from the demonstration of lineage markers) (World Health Organization 2020). In the late phase of SARS (phase III, 10-15 days after the onset of illness), also type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and Similarly, in a large Chinese study, also other groups with impaired lung functioning, like patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have shown to constitute an important risk with high co-morbidity rate when infected with this new coronavirus (Guan et al. 2020) . To these potential risk groups, also patients with fibrotic lung developments following several (auto) immune disorders (like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], scleroderma, etcetera) and other etiologies causing impaired lung functioning, may be added. The importance of resident lung macrophages in keeping a tolerant immune state of the lungs, in order to strongly inhibit local T cell responses, has been noted for a considerable time (Holt 1994) . During inflammation, a 'protective' immune reaction is raised, involving T cell reactions directed to the lungs (Holt 1994) . However, obviously, insufficient knowledge is available enabling us to link the activated characteristics of a patient's immune system and the risk of developing ARDS following infection with 2019 nCoV. Similar to the risk of developing allergic disorders, too little information is yet applicable on the importance of a T-helper-2-type responsiveness Imai et al. 2008) .\"In acute lung injury, such as acid aspiration, pneumonia or scepsis, the generation of Ang II from Ang I is enhanced by ACE, and Ang II induces acute lung failure through stimulation of AT 1 R while ACE2 and AT2R negatively regulate this pathway and protect from acute lung failure. In contrast, SARS-CoV infection is mediated through binding of the SARS Spike Protein to ACE2 (\u2026) and downregulates the protective molecule ACE2, thus leading to severe lung injury and acute lung failure\" (cited from Imai et al. 2008 ) (A possible, alternative route via L-SIGN, i.e. the liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin, may result in a similar clinical outcome) (tolerogenic) versus a T-helper-1-type responsiveness (inflammatory reaction) in the immune reactions to these viral infections (Allaerts and Chang 2017) .",

Given the increased vulnerability of patients with age and the widespread use of ACE-inhibitors, more research into the epidemiological relation between the use of ACE-inhibitors and 2019-nCoV-related ARDS is needed.

Similarly, ACE-inhibition may influence renal function and interstitial renal damage following SARS infection (Hamming 2008) . Also during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, chronic kidney diseases also have constituted a high co-morbidity factor comparable to the comorbidity associated with diabetes, following the highest comorbidity associated with hypertension (Guan et al. 2020 ).

But none of these questions may find an answer without acknowledging the moral connotations involved in these questions. I choose not to go in that direction and rather confine what we may learn from the present and past pandemics/epidemics. In the case of MERS, yearly recurrent episodes of epidemics were registered since the first outbreak in 2012. Also here the CFR was very high, namely 36% (690 fatalities of a total of 1936 WHO-confirmed cases) (Toosy and O'Sullivan 2017 ). An outspoken difference between MERS and 2019-nCoV is the limited distribution of the MERS epidemic, predominantly occurring in the Arabic peninsula, with one significant exception: this was the MERS outbreak in the Republic of (South) Korea in May-July 2015 (Toosy and O'Sullivan 2017) . Nevertheless, MERS also caused victims in a large number of countries outside the region (Toosy and O'Sullivan 2017) . These data suggested that the MERS-related coronavirus was less infective, which may or not be attributable to a different entry of the virus (see Sect. 2).",

Nearly 3 months after the outbreak of this new pandemic, it is way too early to draw firm conclusions from these observations. Also it is rather early to draw conclusions about a possible seasonal influence of the new virus. A possible seasonality dependence however has been suggested for other coronaviruses, e.g. causing the seasonal cold (like the Human coronavirus OC43), and the viruses causing influenza and other viral diseases (Martinez 2018) . In a commentary paper, Cohen (2020) suggests that cold and dry air conditions, like in the ski-resorts in Northern Italy and other alpine regions, may have constituted ideal conditions for human-to-human infectivity (Cohen 2020) . However, suggestions of the ideal humidity conditions in the air and airways, are very speculative and may constitute a dangerously biased surmise of protection. If physical parameters would offer such a degree of protection, by lowering the infectivity rate, this could only become noted after several seasons of the pandemic have passed.",

Without detailed knowledge of the etiology of the late immune responses causing vital organ failure and high numbers of fatalities, classical models do not answer these unfamiliar diseases (Allaerts 2019) . Technically, models based on incorporating acquired-immunity during the spreading of an epidemic, may become flawed in the case of SARS and COVID-19, because of a misinterpretation of the totality of immune reactions involved (see Sect. 3). Whether or not alternative models based on different mathematical distributions (Allaerts 2019) are better suited, is too early to decide at this stage of the pandemic. Also the WHO-report (World Health Organization 2020) cautions, because, so far it is unknown how immunity against 2019-nCoV will become built up by the recovered patients. Besides, the potentially high risk of a frequently mutating virus-pool-changing its antigenic properties in the course of the seasons ahead-may dampen our optimism, despite the worldwide efforts to raise a vaccine against this new COVID-19. For comparison, the MERS epidemic resulted from a mutation in the pool of bat coronaviruses around 2012 (Toosy and O'Sullivan 2017) , whereas also the new bat related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appeared in a time span of only two decades (2002-2019).",

Also the immunological reactions to these viral-host interactions by the host immune system are of primary importance. The latter route may also become very instructive for directing vaccine development to this 2019-nCoV.",

These features are consistent with the late, irreversible obstruction of the bronchioles(Weiss and Leibowitz 2011). The worsening of clinical progression, simultaneously with declining viral loads and markedly elevated cytokine levels, the so-called cytokine-storm (during SARS phase III, but also seen in COVID-19), corroborate the conclusion that these late pathological effects are the result of a fatal overreaction of the immune system (Weiss and Leibowitz 2011) (see below).",
