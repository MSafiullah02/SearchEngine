Healthcare systems in many countries have been pushed to breaking point in an attempt to deal with the pandemic. At present, there is no accurate estimation about how long the COVID-19 situation will persist, the number of individuals worldwide who will be infected, or how long people's lives will be disrupted (Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, 2020; Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020) . Like previous epidemics and pandemics, the unpredictable consequences and uncertainty surrounding public safety, as well as misinformation about COVID-19 (particularly on social media) can often impact individuals' mental health including depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress (Cheung et al., 2008; Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020) .",

These are the common features of typical mental health suffering that many individuals will experience during and after the crisis (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Banerjee, 2020; Cheung et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2020) . In extreme cases, such mental health issues can lead to suicidal behaviors (e.g., suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and actual suicide). It is well stablished that around 90 % of global suicides are due to individuals with mental health conditions such as depression (Mamun and Griffiths, 2020) . Similar situations have been reported in previous pandemics. For example, the suicide rate among elderly people increased in Hong Kong both during and after the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic in 2003 (Cheung et al., 2008) .",

Due to the social avoidance and attitudes by others around him, he committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in the village near his house. Unfortunately, the autopsy showed that the victim did not have COVID-19 (Somoy News, 2020).",

Based on these two cases, it appears that village people and the victim's moral conscience had major roles in contributing the suicides. In the south Asian country like Bangladesh and India, village people arguably less educated than those that live in cities. Therefore, elevated fears and misconceptions surrounding COVID-19 among villagers may have led to higher levels of xenophobia, and that xenophobia may have been a major contributing factor in committing suicide.",
