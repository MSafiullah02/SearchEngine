            "text": "A repeated theme in reviewing emergent outbreaks is that it is essential that astute clinicians with sufficient experience will recognize and distinguish something new. It is difficult to comment about clinicians in the early course of SARS in China, because nothing was reported. However, when the epidemic appeared in Vietnam, the team of physicians at the French Hospital of Hanoi led by Dr. Carlo Urbani immediately alerted the world (9). His colleagues in the Doctors without Borders group recognized a defining feature of the cluster of community-acquired pneumonias: 30 of the initial 60 cases involved health care workers. Sadly, within weeks Dr. Urbani and four of his colleagues themselves would die as victims of SARS. It later became apparent that whereas the 9% mortality was somewhat higher than the expected mortality for the usual causes of community-acquired pneumonias (approximately 2\u20134%), the 50% mortality for patients over age 60 also distinguished this pathogen (10). Diarrhea and dyspnea were common among populations studied with SARS (11), but each was not highly predictive of infection in any single patient with the novel coronavirus. Thus, the high transmissibility to nurses and physicians and the higher than expected mortality were key features strongly suggesting a new pathogen. Furthermore, SARS to many clinicians appeared to have a biphasic course, with cough and fever initially followed in 3\u20135 days with a normal temperature and increasing hypoxia. The point is that physicians and nurses need to be trained to be alert to the unusual, the unexpected, and the variant clinical presentation. The astute, frontline health care worker is the first defense against spread of an emerging pathogen.",

It probably should not be tied to financial penalties, however, because government officials and not the general citizenry would make the decision to obscure the truth. For example, one could consider the banning of the country from participating in the subsequent Olympics, a situation that would cause national shame for the country's political leadership. Alternatively, the offending country might not be allowed to cast votes in the United Nations for a 1-year period. Of course, there are no guarantees that either the favorable financial incentives or an international rebuke would always lead to early reporting, but the ideas are testable.",

The fact is that the boundaries between foreign or exotic and what is traditionally referred to as domestic or local have blurred. We in the developed world cannot afford to be disengaged or appear to show indifference to the health challenge of less fortunate populations living in remote sectors of the world. The noted ethicist Peter Singer argues that given the advances in transportation and communication, coupled with the emergence of transnational companies and universal problems, we must transcend national boundaries to embrace a new ethic of one world (16).

Alternatively, the students may be in a panic way and plans for managing their exposures and concerns need to be formally addressed and managed. We suggest that institutions recognize the fear and uncertainty among health care workers when a new epidemic hits. Creating telephone hot lines with trained professionals would seem to be an important first step. Thereafter, a Psychological Support Response Team should be formed to outline appropriate procedures to manage the stresses expected and to define specific goals of intervention and therapy. Trained counselors who can explore the origins of individual fears need to be on the team and supported by infectious disease experts who can discuss the facts related to the disease, its incubation period, the risk of transmission and outcomes. Because we will continue to see new epidemics, hospitals might consider developing guidelines now that could be utilized in future introductions of new pathogens.",

Four contacts of the nurse became ill with SARS, thus representing tertiary transmission of the infection. Herein is the lesson: laboratory-associated cases will occur after epidemics of new pathogens, and assiduous procedures for managing all stored laboratory specimens are essential to avoid such infections. Additionally, secondary and tertiary transmissions can occur and lead to death in some instances. All laboratories with the new pathogen should review their protocols for strict adherence to procedures that will preclude transmission to those handling such agents.

Epidemiologists had suspected this early because these same occupations among people in southern China were five-times over-represented compared to controls (37). Subsequently, microbiological confirmation came after an almost identical virus was isolated from the civit cat, a member of the mongoose family considered to be a culinary delicacy in the Guandong Province. Other exotic animals were also found to harbor the virus, and healthy animal handlers were shown to have a high prevalence of antibodies to the SARS coronavirus. However, the most important animal source of the epidemic that sparked the initial human infections remains uncertain. Thereafter, person-to-person spread occurred from patients to health care workers and both family members and other contacts.

Probably not, yet with the annual visits of influenza and its 36,000 deaths in the U.S., the continuing threat of bioterror, the arrival of monkeypox in the U.S., and recent experience with SARS, which may return, large hospitals need to provide a geographically clustered area with an additional 10 or more rooms with negative air pressure (negative to the hallway) so that a variety of respiratory pathogens can be contained to the patients' rooms. Such steps would go a long way to create a new era of preparedness, not focused only on the latest pathogen. 2) There can be no excuse for health care workers who fail to wash hands between patients. Unfortunately, the current compliance rates in U.S. critical care units are only 40\u201360%. Better rates of hand washing need to be realized. Hand-washing rates should become an issue for the annual evaluation of health care workers and a necessary component for continued employment. 3) There are a limited number of occasions when the hospital environment needs to be disinfected and not just cleaned. It is recognized that transmission of most infections in the hospital is not from the environment. Nevertheless, we pay insufficient attention to this aspect of infection control when we are beset with specific problems. In all ongoing challenges with multi-antibiotic resistant, hospital-acquired infections (now common in the U.S.), antibiotic-associated diarrheal infections, and now SARS, we have several unique situations in which it is useful to decontaminate the hard surfaces that are commonly touched, such as bedside tables, door knobs, and IV poles. 4) To avoid needlestick injuries and the spread of bloodborne infections, we need to champion the available technology of non-sharp devices such as retractable needles after blood draws. If these technologies are affordable and effectively used, they will have the benefit of reducing in-hospital transmission of hepatitis C, HIV infection, and others\u2014possibly including SARS.",
