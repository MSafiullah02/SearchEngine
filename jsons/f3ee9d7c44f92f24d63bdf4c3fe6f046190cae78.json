Our previous studies demonstrated that the culture media derived from chondrocyte-scaffold constructs (conditional media) contained various soluble chondrogenic factors and were effective for directing chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the conditional media can induce ASCs towards chondrogenic differentiation, especially for three-dimensional (3D) cartilage formation in a preshaped scaffold. In this study, it demonstrated that the conditional media derived from chondrocyte-scaffold constructs could promote ASCs to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells, with similar expression of type II collagen to those induced by chondrogenic growth factors. Moreover, the expression level of chondrocyte-specific genes, such as SOX9, type II collagen, and COMP, was even higher in conditional medium group (CM) than that in optimized chondrogenic growth factor group (GF), indicating that the conditional media can serve as an effective inducer for chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs. Most importantly, the conditional media could also induce ASC-scaffold constructs to form 3D cartilage-like tissue with typical lacunae structures and positive expression of cartilage specific matrices, even higher contents of GAG and type II collagen were achieved in CM group compared to GF group. The current study establishes a simple, but stable, efficient, and economical method for directing 3D cartilage formation of ASCs, a strategy that may be more closely applicable for repairing cartilage defects.",

            "text": "Soluble autocrine and paracrine factors secreted by chondrocytes have proved to be effective in enhancing chondrogenesis of both chondrocytes and bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs). 9-13 A more recent study reported that the media of monolayer cultured chondrocytes could also promote chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs during in vitro pellet culture, 14 which sheds a new light for chondrogenesis of ASCs without the application of high-dose growth factors. However, chondrocytes that underwent monolayer culture tend to age and de-differentiate rapidly, in which process key chondrogenic genes were significantly down-regulated and synthesis and secretion of chondrogenic factors were thus compromised, leading to an inferior chondroinductive efficacy. [15] [16] [17] Our previous study has shown that the concentrations of chondrogenic factors in the culture media of chondrocytescaffold constructs (conditional media hereinafter) manifest a stable time-dependent increase in both short and long time courses. Moreover, the conditional media showed strong inductive role for chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. 11 Nevertheless, due to differential sensitivities to chondrogenic factors between ASCs and BMSCs, 5 it remains unclear whether the conditional media can induce ASCs towards chondrogenic differentiation. Especially, it is still uncertain whether a threedimensional (3D) cartilage-like tissue, a practical need for repairing cartilage defects, can be regenerated using ASCs and pre-shaped scaffolds by in vitro induction of the conditional media. To address these issues, in the current study, we introduced the conditional medium derived from in vitro engineered cartilage as a novel inducer to explore its role in directing chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs. Based on this, we further explored the feasibility of regenerating 3D cartilage using ASCs and preshaped biodegradable scaffolds by in vitro induction of the conditional media.",

The current results demonstrated that the culture media derived from chondrocyte-scaffold constructs (the conditional media) could efficiently direct chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs and even achieved higher expressions of cartilage specific genes compared to the current optimized growth factors. Most importantly, the conditional media were also able to promote 3D cartilage formation of ASCs on PGA/PLA scaffold in vitro with higher contents of some cartilage specific matrices compared to the current optimized growth factors, which provides a stable and simple inductive method for the application of ASCs in cartilage regeneration.",

The early chondroinductive method of ASCs was mainly derived from that of BMSCs: a combination of exogenous growth factors. However, studies showed that the chondrogenesis efficiency of ASCs was much lower than that of BMSCs, [29] [30] [31] which was speculated to be related to the abnormalities of BMP profile and TGF-\u03b2 receptor in ASCs, hence high doses of exogenous growth factors (such as BMPs) were required, 5,6 leading to problems such as hypertrophy and calcification in vivo. 5, 7, 8 Evidently, avoiding the application of high-dose growth factors is the key to solve these problems.",

Our previous study demonstrated that chondrocytes played an essential role in chondroinduction, and that the conditional media collected from the supernatant of chondrocyte-scaffold constructs could successfully induce chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs with no assistance from exogenous chondrogenic factors 11 , which provides a clue for chondrogenesis of ASCs instead of the application of high-dose growth factors. Nevertheless, it is still uncertain whether the conditional medium is likewise efficient for chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs especially for 3D cartilage formation on a pre-shaped scaffold. After all, there are still many differences between ASCs and BMSCs, such as cell population components and their sensitivity to chondrogenic factors as mentioned above. The current results demonstrated that without exogenous growth factors, the conditional media still could efficiently direct not only chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs but also 3D cartilage formation, even better than high-dose growth factors, indicating that the conditional media may serve as a new ideal method for directing chondrogenesis of ASCs.",

[15] [16] [17] Thirdly, the conditional media may achieve better chondroinductive efficiency compared to the current optimized chondrogenic factors. The current results have shown that CM group achieved significantly higher expressions of some cartilage specific genes at monolayer induction and significantly higher GAG content at 3D induction compared to GF group. Finally, studies reported that soluble factors secreted by chondrocytes not only enhance chondrogenesis but also inhibit terminal differentiation and matrix calcification, which may be related to parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) secreted by chondrocytes. 9, 32, 33 From this point of view, using the conditional media as the inducer may help avoiding the possible side effects caused by high-dose growth factors, such as hypertrophy and calcification in vivo, 5, 7, 8 and thus contribute to stable cartilage formation.",

These unknown factors obviously play a vital role in chondroinduction, since they can achieve similar efficiency of chondroinduction to high-dose growth factors.
