Previous studies on the nursing workforce have, so far, focused on determining \u201cmore nurses and better patient outcomes.\u201d However, a controversial debate on the cost\u2010effectiveness of hiring more nurses still continues (Aiken, Cimiotti, Sloane, Smith, Flynn, & Neff, 2011). When it comes to nursing workforce policy\u2010materializing in practice, the inconclusiveness of nursing efficiency is considered to be one of the critical reasons for the failure to narrow the gap between the ideal and the real. How can we fix this two\u2010sided coin? The bottleneck is impeding us from moving forward from a \u201cvolume\u2010driven\u201d to \u201cvalue\u2010driven\u201d healthcare delivery system. There is no more time for delay. We need to rethink this issue from a different angle.",

Such changes can transform the healthcare delivery system to be more value\u2010driven, justifiable and more effective. It is particularly critical that such operations build upon evidence\u2010based, informed shared decision\u2010making rationales among all parties comprising our healthcare delivery system. However, these rationales are absent from the current literature. Knowledge without a foundation in science might lead to muddled policy\u2010making.",

In Korea, there is a tradition that family member(s) or a hired carer(s) stays with the patient while he or she is in the hospital. However, it was discovered that the practice made effective and efficient infection control impossible. The care tradition was one of the reasons behind the 38 fatalities (a lethality rate of 20.4%) caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2015 (Kim, 2015), whereupon the inception of the Korean\u2010CNCS began to emerge as the key solution.",

Caregivers can also lessen the burden of time as well as the physical and emotional stresses from exhaustive caring. In addition, caregivers can benefit from an insured caring cost from the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation. However, surprisingly, in February 2017, the Korean government retracted the original plan to expand the Korean\u2010CNCS to the whole country by 2018 (Shin, 2017). Why?",

Korea already has a significant shortage of nurses in practice; and what is worse, the Korean\u2010CNCS seems to make nurses\u2019 working conditions more difficult. Four of five new nurses left their jobs because of the much heavier workloads caused by the Korean\u2010CNCS (Chae, 2016). In fact, the majority of newly hired nursing staff hold temporary positions (Kim, 2016). Furthermore, the Korean\u2010CNCS caused inequity in access to healthcare when urban hospitals absorbed the nurse staffing of local hospitals to get more government grants, which eventually led to the closure of the only emergency center in a certain rural area (Kim, 2017).",

Ironically, in 2014 Korea produced the most nursing graduates per 100,000 inhabitants among all OECD countries, and even more than three times that of the UK (122 vs. 29) (OECD 2017b). A special law on the health workforce with strict regulations is now expected to be re\u2010proposed to ensure patient safety (Seo, 2016).

That is to say, the realizable solution is not situated in traditional statistics\u2010based nursing research, but in synthesizing Decision Science and incorporating Mathematical Economics and Operations Research into nursing science (Park, 2017). The multidisciplinary consilience can provide feasible solution(s)\u2014not simply right answer(s)\u2014to the important and yet unanswered question: i.e., balancing quality, cost and nurse staffing in the continuum of changes for better nursing workforce practice and policy\u2010making (Park, 2017).",

They were marching in that direction which was right then, but the world changes. There's the new direction; but the old fellows are still marching in their former direction. You need to get into a new field to get new viewpoints\u2019 (pp. 14). Silera, Leeb, & Beroc (2014) and Lamont (2009) also set forth similar opinions that editors tend to become averse to taking risks because of the limited time and resources in peer reviewing and selecting manuscripts, not falling outside the existing hegemony\u2010based system, which may sometimes be the cause of missing timely innovation in science.",

Such self\u2010reflection will help us to recognize and address the truly important problems in the world, which will in turn enable us to achieve value\u2010based healthcare delivery reform, improving lives and consequently steering us to become great scientists. Let me conclude by citing the most impressive part of Hamming's (1986) You and Your Research, which emphasizes a \u201cdrive\u201d and \u2018commitment\u2019 to the important challenges of doing first\u2010class science:Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory. [\u2026] It requires a lovely balance. But most great scientists are well aware of why their theories are true, and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit and they don't forget it. [\u2026] When you find apparent flaws, you've got to be sensitive, and keep track of those things, and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory can be changed to fit them. Those are often the great contributions. Great contributions are rarely done by adding another decimal place. It comes down to an emotional commitment. Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem. Those who don't become committed seldom produce outstanding, first\u2010class work (Kaiser, 1986, pp. 5).\n",
