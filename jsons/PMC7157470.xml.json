            "text": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small (8.6 kDa) regulatory protein of 76 amino acids that adopts a \u03b2-grasp fold. Ub is highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms. The conjugation of ubiquitin to a target protein is called ubiquitination or ubiquitylation.1 Typically, Ub is attached to proteins through an isopeptide linkage between the C-terminal carboxylate of ubiquitin (glycine 76) and an \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue in the acceptor proteins. Ubiquitination is an important, reversible post-translational modification (PTM) in eukaryotic cells. Since its discovery in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the modification by ubiquitin has emerged as an essential regulatory mechanism in almost all cellular processes in eukaryotes. Ubiquitination affects substrate proteins in many different ways including signaling, proteasomal degradation, altering cellular localization, modulating catalytic activity, and promoting or preventing protein interactions.2, 3 The cellular processes regulated by ubiquitination include cell cycle, transcription, trafficking, inflammation and DNA repair. Notably, many of the processes are independent of proteasome-mediated protein degradation.4\n",

The human genome possesses more than 30 different E2 enzymes.9 The E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzes the final step of the ubiquitination cascade by transferring Ub from the Ub-E2 conjugate to the substrate protein. E3s have substrate specificity for the E2 enzymes. The cullin-RING ligases, which constitute the largest group of E3s (around 600 members), do not form a covalent bond with Ub. Two smaller groups of E3s, the HECT ligases (around 30 members) and RBR ligases (around 12 members), form a Ub-thioester intermediate with the E3 active site cysteine.10\n",

For instance, the K48-linked polyubiquitination is the best studied Ub modification and it targets proteins to the proteasome for degradation.13 The K63-linked polyubiquitination is mostly related to non-proteolytic processes such as endocytic trafficking, inflammation, translation, and DNA repair.1, 14 M1-linked (also called linear) Ub chains play a very important roles in immune response.15\n",

In the human genome there are close to 100 DUBs, which can be classified into two main categories, i.e. cysteine proteases and metalloproteases.16 The cysteine proteases can be further divided into six families: ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ovarian tumor proteases (OTU), Machado-Josephin domain DUBs (MJD), motif interacting with Ub-containing novel DUB family (MINDY) and the newly characterized zinc finger with UFM1-specific peptidase (ZUFSP). In the USP family, there are around 56 known DUBs (Fig. 2\n). The UCH family includes BAP1, UCHL1, UCHL3, UCHL5. The OTU family includes A20, Cezannes, and OTUs (Fig. 2). The MJD family has four members, Ataxin-3, Ataxin-3 like, JosD1, JosD2. The MINDY family contains four members MINDY-1 to -4. ZUFSP is the most recently reported DUB with no homology to any known DUBs.17 The metalloprotease group contains only the Jab1/Mov34/Mpr1, Pad1 N-terminal+, (MPN+), (JAMM) domain proteases. JAMM family contains eight members: BRCC36, CSN5, PSMD14, AMSH, AMSH-LP, MPND, MYSM1 and PRPF8.",

The choice of warhead will affect both the reactivity and selectivity of the probe. The recognition element of ABPs confers selectivity toward the target enzyme, which can be a small molecule, a short peptide, or a full-length protein. A reporter tag (also referred to as a handle or label), can be used to detect probe labeled proteins. There are several generally used reporter tags. While the fluorescent tag can facilitate rapid and sensitive detection of labeled proteins, affinity tags (such as biotin or HA) also allow for isolation and enrichment of labeled proteins. Alternatively, a small biorthogonal group such as an alkyne or azide may be incorporated into the probe to allow subsequent attachment of a reporter through click chemistry.32 This is often referred to as \u201ctwo-step\u201d labeling, and may be particularly advantageous when larger tags interfere with reactivity, selectivity, or physiochemical properties of the probe. For larger ABPs, such as the DUB probes, substantial increase in the molecular weight of the labeled protein, as detected on a SDS-PAGE gel, can be used as an indication of probe labeling.",

However, the modification of DUBs by Ub-Al and Ub-CN is reversible and is not compatible with the strongly reducing conditions of SDS/PAGE gel analysis. To overcome the limitations of these probes, Borodovsky et al. developed irreversible DUB ABPs by introducing a C-terminal reactive group using the intein-based chemical ligation method.48, 49 To generate the desired DUB ABPs, N-terminal HA-tagged Ub (HA-Ub) lacking Gly76 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with an intein and a chitin binding domain. Purification using chitin beads, followed by a transthioesterification reaction with sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA) led to the isolation of the desired thioester. The desired irreversible DUB ABPs were synthesized by chemical ligation of the reactive groups (methyl (E)-4-aminobut-2-enoate et al.) with HA-Ub1\u201375-MESNA and purified by cation exchange chromatography. The covalent ABPs labeled DUBs in cell lysates and could be detected following SDS/PAGE immunoblotting due to the presence of an HA tag on the probe. Following similar chemical ligation methods, related Ubl-VS probes for ISG-15, SUMO-1, GATE-16, GABARAP, MAP1-LC3, and Apg8L were reported shortly thereafter.50\n",

Subsequent efforts have therefore been directed to making diUb probes containing two intact mono Ubs. McGouran et al. generated activity-based diUb probes with eight different Ub linkages (M1, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) using azide-alkyne click reaction (Fig. 7\n).35 To generate the desired diUb probe, the Cu(I)-catalyzed click reaction was used to link the proximal and distal Ub. In the distal Ub, an intein-based method was used to introduce a Michael acceptor warhead and an alkyne group at the C-terminus of HA-Ub1\u201375. For the proximal ubiquitin, an unnatural amino acid, azidohomoalanine (Aha), was introduced to substitute the target lysine residue using the methionine analog incorporation approach.54 Subsequently, the proximal Ub was linked to the C-terminus of the distal Ub by the Cu(I)-catalyzed click reaction forming a 1,4-triazole linker. With the diUb probes in hand, 29 DUBs in total including 18 USPs, 4 UCHs, 5 OTUs, 1 MJD, and one SUMO deconjugating enzyme were captured by the probes from HEK293T cell lysate using LC-MS/MS.",

Solid phase peptide synthesis was used to generate distal ubiquitin containing a N-terminal tetramethyl rhodamine as a reporter tag and a propargylamide warhead at C-terminus of the proximal Ub. For the proximal Ub, the unnatural amino acid azidohomoalanine (Aha) was introduced at the specific position using a methionine analog incorporation approach.54 Then, the distal ubiquitin mutant can react with proximal ubiquitin mutant through a Cu(I)-catalyzed click reaction to generate a diUb intermediate. Finally, the diUb intermediate can react with propargylamine to generate the final terminal diUb probes. Seven linkage specific (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) terminal diUb probes were generated by this method. With the probes, OTUD2 was shown to possess specificity for K11 and K33-linked terminal diUb probes due to engagement of S1-S2 sites on OTUD2.

Paudel et al. recently reported hybrid triubiquitin probes with a Michael acceptor or a non-cleavable linker introduced at selected isopeptide linkage in a triUb.64 In brief, the synthesis of the probes were accomplished via a two-step method (Fig. 12\n). The first step utilized specific E1 and E2 combinations to generate K11, K48 and K63-linked native diUb containing a lysine to cysteine mutation. In parallel, HA-Ub1\u201375-MESNA was either reacted with a Michael acceptor (MA) or non-cleavable (NC) linker molecule to generate HA-Ub-MA and HA-Ub-NC, respectively. In the second step, HA-Ub-NC or HA-Ub-MA was reacted with the mutant diUb species to yield triUb-MA1-CL2 or triUb-NC1-CL2. The triUb probes can be used to interrogate the endo/exo cleavage modes of DUBs by simultaneously assessing the binding of all three Ub moieties to the potential S1, S2 and S1\u2032 sites in DUBs. Using hybrid triUb probes, the USP9X catalytic domain (USP9X CD) was shown to process triUb chains in a linkage-specific way. Specifically, USP9X CD cleaves K48-linked polyUb chain in an exo cleavage mode, as demonstrated by labeling with K48 triUb-MA1-CL2, while no cleavage activity of K48 triUb-NC1-CL2. In contrast, USP9X CD displayed endo recognition of K11 polyUb chains by efficiently cleaving K11 triUb-NC1-CL2 and K11 triUb-MA1-CL2 probes while showing very low level labeling by K11 triUb-MA1-CL2 probe. These triUb probes can be used to investigate other DUBs in processing polyUb chains of different linkages.",

In particular, a \u201cCys-loop\u201d near the active site occupies the catalytic groove rendering the enzyme inactive in its apo state. In the co-crystal structure, binding of the proximal ubiquitin to the S1\u2032 site resulted in movement of the Cys-loop out of the catalytic site, thus enabling the catalytic Cys194 for reaction with the diUb ABP. The interaction regions of the S1\u2032 site Ub were found to be the \u03b1-helix of ubiquitin as well as its Thr12 and Glu16 residues. In Cezanne, the S1\u2032 site comprises the \u03b11, \u03b12 helices and \u03b13-\u03b14 linker region.82 Mutation of residues in S1\u2032 site did not drastically reduce polyubiquitin cleavage activity, likely due to the weak interaction in S1\u2032 site as compared to the S1 site. The structural changes upon K11 diubiquitin binding supports the importance of S1\u2032 site ubiquitin binding, which imparts the selectivity toward K11 linked polyubiquitin chains by Cezanne/OTUD7B.82\n",

Currently, several methods of synthesizing monoubiquitin, diubiquitin and triubiquitin ABPs have been developed including solid phase synthesis and chemoenzymatic reactions. These probes have already yielded valuable information on how DUBs recognize and process polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated proteins.
