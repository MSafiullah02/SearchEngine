The concept is analogous to biologic warfare in a combat theater. The broad scope and mounting boldness of worldwide terrorism was impressively demonstrated by the massive attacks on New York City and Washington DC on September 11, 2001; the multifocal anthrax attacks that followed shortly thereafter, while not known to be directly related to 9/11, awakened civilized society to the threats posed by these \u2018weapons of mass terror\u2019. This realization, in concert with recent revelations regarding the apparent willingness of terrorist organizations to acquire and deploy biologic weapons, constitutes ample evidence that the specter of bioterrorism poses a persistent global threat.",

It has been variously speculated that at least some of the plagues visited upon ancient Egypt, as documented in the biblical book of Exodus, represented natural outbreaks of endemic infectious diseases that were recast as supreme forms of bioterrorism. In the 14th century Tatars attempted to use epidemic disease against the defenders of Kaffa by catapulting plague-infected corpses into the city.1 British forces gave Native American tribespeople blankets from a smallpox hospital in an attempt to affect the balance of power in the 18th century Ohio River Valley.1 In addition to their well-described use of chemical weapons, Axis forces purportedly infected livestock with anthrax and glanders to weaken Allied initiatives during the First World War. Perhaps the most egregious period in the history of biologic weaponry involved the Japanese program in Manchuria from 1932 to 1945. Based on survivor accounts and confessions of Japanese participants, thousands died as a result of experimental infection with a multitude of virulent pathogens at Unit 731, the code name for the biologic weapons facility there.2\n",

The accidental release of aerosolized anthrax spores from a military plant in Sverdlovsk in 1979, resulting in at least 68 human deaths from inhalational anthrax, verifies the existence of an active Soviet offensive biologic weapons program.",

Unlike other forms, biologic agents are associated with a clinical latency period of days to weeks in most cases, during which time exposed individuals are asymptomatic and early detection is quite difficult with currently available technology. Additionally, specific antimicrobial therapy and, in select circumstances, vaccines are available for the treatment and prevention of illness caused by biologic weapons; casualties from other forms of WMD can generally only be treated by decontamination, trauma mitigation and supportive care.",

Metropolitan areas are considered vulnerable, but owing to the expansion of suburbs, commuters, and the clinical latency period between exposure and symptoms inherent with biologic agents, casualties of bioterrorism are likely to present for medical attention in diverse locations and at varying times following a common exposure. An event in New York City on a Wednesday morning may result in clinically ill individuals presenting over the ensuing weekend to a variety of emergency rooms within a 60-mile radius. Additionally, our mobile society ensures that affected individuals will likely present for medical care thousands of miles away from the original release point of the bioterrorist's weapon.

In nature anthrax is a zoonotic disease of herbivores that is prevalent in many geographic regions; sporadic human disease results from environmental or occupational contact with endospore-contaminated animal products.15 Anthrax is uncommon in developed countries. In developing areas the cutaneous form of anthrax is the most common presentation; gastrointestinal and inhalational forms are exceedingly rare in naturally acquired disease. Cutaneous anthrax is rarely seen in current-day industrialized countries due to importation restrictions. The last known case of naturally occurring inhalational anthrax in the USA occurred in 1976.16\n",

Spores may remain latent for extended periods of time in the host, up to 100 days in some experimental animal exposures17 This has translated into prolonged clinical incubation periods following exposure to endospores; cases of inhalational anthrax occurred up to 43 days after exposure in the Sverdlovsk experience, although the average incubation period is 2\u201310 days, perhaps influenced by exposure inoculum.15,\n17\n",

They subsequently develop a centrifugally distributed eruption that initially involves the face and extremities and then generalizes as it evolves through macular, papular, vesicular and pustular stages in synchronous (i.e. lesions progress concurrently and have similar appearances diffusely) fashion over approximately 8 days, with umbilication in the latter stages (Fig. 71.6\n). Enanthema in the oropharynx typically precede the exanthem by a day or two; this represents high titer viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and correlates with high infectivity. The rash generally remains denser peripherally and typically involves the palms and soles early on, a potentially useful clue in narrowing the differential diagnosis (Fig. 71.7\n). The umbilicated pustules begin crusting during the second week of the eruption; separation of scabs is usually complete by the end of the third week, but the course of the systemic illness may be attenuated and the appearance of the exanthem milder in those with partial, pre-existing immunity or more progressive and virulent in those with immunodeficient states.",

Once again, however, vigilance is necessary as naturally occurring disease can be acquired by a variety of routes and present in many clinical forms; therefore an intentional release of bacteria may also result in more than one form of tularemia. Pulmonic tularemia presents with the abrupt onset of a febrile systemic illness with prominent upper respiratory symptoms, pleuritic chest pain, and the variable development of pneumonia, hilar adenopathy and progression to respiratory failure and death in approximately 30% of inappropriately treated patients.36 The diagnosis is generally established on clinical features, based on the differential diagnosis (see Table 71.3) and microbiologic data; laboratory personnel should be notified in advance if tularemia is suspected, as the organism can be very infectious when manipulated in laboratory conditions. This agent is discussed in depth in Chapter 121.",
