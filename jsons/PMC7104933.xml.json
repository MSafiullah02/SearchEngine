Depending on the basis of these anatomical imaging techniques, the infections can only be detected after formation of a morphological alteration. Therefore, early stage detections are not possible by the use of these routine medical imaging modalities especially in deeply seated infections, for example, osteomyelitis, intraabdominal infections and endocarditis. For this purpose, the use of scintigraphic imaging modalities such as gamma scintigraphy, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and hybrid imaging modalities comprising SPECT/CT, PET/CT, PET/MRI can provide physiologic and metabolic information about the lesion.",

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics specifically bind and inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase. 99mTc\u2010Ciprofloxacin was one of the first radiolabeled antibiotics in 1990s to image microbial infections or aseptic inflammation [23]. Ciprofloxacin was labeled using formamidine sulfuric acid (FSA) as 99mTc reducing agent at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. However, due to the instability of FSA, stannous ion has been used to increase labeling yield and reduce 99mTc to a lower oxidation state [23]. Afterwards, was 99mTc\u2010Ciprofloxacin was approved for infection imaging and marketed as \u201cInfecton\u00ae\u201d [24,25]. Other fluoroquinolone family antibiotics were also labeled for this purpose [26]. By the improvements in the production of alternative severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) antibiotics and growing drug resistance, a variety of 99mTc-labeled flouroquinolone and cephalosporin antibiotics were prepared including 99mTc\u2010Pefloxacin [27], 99mTc\u2010Lomefloxacin and 99mTc-Ofloxacin [28], 99mTc\u2010Sparafloxacin [29], 99mTc\u2010Difloxacin [30], 99mTc\u2010Moxifloxacin [31], 99mTc\u2010Gemifloxacin [32], 99mTc-Rufloxacin [33], 99mTc\u2010Clinafloxacin [34], 99mTc\u2010Sitafloxacin [35], 99mTc\u2010Levofloxacin [36], 99mTc\u2010Temafloxacin [37], 99mTc-Ceftizoxime [38], 99mTc\u2010Cefuroxime [5], 99mTc\u2010Ceftriaxone [39], 99mTc\u2010Cefotaxime [40] and 99mTc\u2010Cefoperazone [41,42].",

The advantage of the utilization of radiolabeled antibiotics is its ability to differentiate between infection and aseptic inflammation [25,43]. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and belong to third-generation fluoroquinolones. It has an antibacterial activity of optically active l-isomer of ofloxacin. The antibacterial activity of Levofloxacin is due to blockage of bacterial cell growth by inhibiting DNA gyrase (bacterial topoisomerase II) which is an enzyme required for DNA replication, RNA transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA [44].",

Radiolabeled liposomes were designed as imaging agents for inflammation and infectious processes. It was previously demonstrated liposomes with small particle size and surface coating by a hydrophilic polymer (such as PEG) show enhanced blood circulation time providing an increased accumulation at the site of infection [[47], [48], [49], [50], [51]]. Liposomes which are formulated in a particle size of nanometer range and surface coated for passive targeting are called stealth liposomes. A variety of stealth liposomes were prepared and evaluated for this purpose [49,[52], [53], [54]]. Although many previous studies were performed for 99mTc-radiolabeling of antibiotics and liposomes, these techniques are still very valuable for their accumulation in the site of the infection and inflammation [25]. Infection specific radiopharmaceuticals can be successfully used for the diagnosis, imaging and therapy monitoring. There has been an intensive research for the development of specific infection and inflammation imaging probes because routinely used tracers in clinics still cannot evaluate infection and inflammation efficiently.",

In vitro E. coli binding of radiolabeled Levofloxacin and micelles at 37 \u00b0C showed 63 \u00b1 2.4% and 40 \u00b1 1.9%, respectively (Fig. 4\n). Both radiolabeled Levofloxacin and micelles show high in vitro bacterial binding. Tc-99 m radiolabeled PC:SDC micelles exhibit lesser bacterial binding for both S. aureus and E. coli cultures (p < 0,05). This may be due to the fact that 99mTc-radiolabeled PC:SDC micelles are not specific to bacterial infections as much as 99mTc-Levofloxacin. However, Tc-99 m radiolabeled PC:SDC micelles can also be assumed as sensitive radiopharmaceutical agents due to the mechanism of imaging of infection and inflammation. 99mTc-radiolabeled, PEGylated, PC, SDC and DTPA-PE containing nanosized micelles can accumulate at infection and inflammation sites due to long vascular circulation of vesicles by small particle size and surface coating by an hydrophilic polymer (such as PEG) [47,[52], [53], [54]]. It was reported in some previous studies that the accumulation of radiolabeled liposomes in at infectious sites is performed by leakage of the vesicles through vessels. This leakage depends on the enhanced vascular permeability and following phagocythosis by macrophages of infected tissue. It was reported that the endothelial junctions existing in the blood vessel provides the penetration of the particles smaller than 200 nm from the vascularization [48,54]. Therefore, surface coated, nanosized drug delivery systems like liposomes can be accumulated at the site of infection and inflammation due to long circulation, enhanced vascular permeability and reduced removal by opsonisation [49,52,65].",

Despite, radiolabelled antibiotics could represent a promising tool for specifically image infective processes, radiolabelled micelles do not show a similar specific mechanism of accumulation in infectious/inflammatory sites that is mainly due to increased permeability (that is present in both infective and inflammatory processes) and small particle size. Therefore, this \u201cpassive\u201d and non-specific mechanism implies that they could be useful for monitoring the inflammatory burden but, since radiolabelled micelles are not able to discriminate between an infection from a sterile inflammation, their use for imaging of infections is limited in clinical practice.",

Although, radiolabeled Levofloxacin is particularly an excellent alternative for the detection of chronic infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, radiolabeled PEGylated, PC, SDC and DTPA-PE containing nanosized micelles were also evaluated as a potential candidate in the detection of infection and inflammation. As it was known, micelles similar to liposomes tend to accumulate at the site of infection based on the long vascular circulation of vesicles by small particle size and surface coating by a hydrophilic polymer (such as PEG). Both radiopharmaceutical agents exhibit potential results in design, characterization, radiolabeling efficiency and in vitro bacterial binding point of view. In vivo potential of radiolabeled Levofloxacin and micelles should also be evaluated in the infection and inflammation animal models in the future.",
