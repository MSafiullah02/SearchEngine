Ang-(1\u20137) has a number of important actions that oppose those of Ang II including vasodilatation [18], [19] and inhibition of cell proliferation and tissue fibrosis [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], an effect that appears to be mediated through the Ang-(1\u20137) receptor Mas [21], [25], [26]. Ang-(1\u20137) is converted to the inactive peptide fragment Ang-(1\u20135) by the action of ACE, and use of ACE inhibitors has been shown to increase Ang-(1\u20137) levels in tissue and plasma [27], [28].",

A time course study was performed to examine the sequential changes that occur in the liver, the circulation and other major sites of RAS expression and activity. In situ perfused rat liver experiments were also performed to determine whether the fibrotic liver has increased capacity to produce Ang-(1\u20137) from Ang II, and whether this could be altered by modifying the degradation of Ang-(1\u20137) with the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril. The effects of Ang-(1\u20137) and Ang II on portal resistance were also studied.",

ACE2 activity (expressed per mg of tissue) was not increased in other sites of ACE2 expression, including lung, kidney and intestine, whilst it was increased more than 4-fold in the liver, so that when the mass of individual organ is taken into account, following BDL the liver was the organ of greatest ACE2 activity. We have shown previously that ACE2 is proteolytically cleaved from membrane by metalloproteases to release a soluble form with catalytic activity [40], [41]. Thus, in the present study, the diseased liver was the likely source of the major increase in plasma ACE2 activity. In situ perfused rat liver experiments confirmed that following administration of Ang II, greater amounts of Ang-(1\u20137) were produced by diseased livers than controls. Importantly, the increase in hepatic ACE2 expression in BDL livers was accompanied by upregulation of ACE expression and activity. The finding that Ang-(1\u20137) release from BDL, but not sham livers, was greatly increased by ACE inhibition indicates that this high level of hepatic ACE activity facilitated the breakdown of Ang-(1\u20137), reducing Ang-(1\u20137) release (Fig. 1). This confirmed that BDL livers have a much greater capacity to metabolize exogenously administered Ang II into Ang-(1\u20137), but that much of this Ang-(1\u20137) is subsequently broken down by ACE. These findings are in keeping with the concept that the net tissue production of Ang-(1\u20137)/Ang II is determined by the relative activity of ACE2 and ACE [19].",

The current studies demonstrated bi-model changes in plasma Ang II levels during the course of the experiment with an initial marked rise at week one followed by a fall in levels at weeks 2 and 3 and then a significant rise at week 4. These changes are likely to reflect a balance between influences of multiple factors including an acute response to the initial liver injury following BDL surgery, increases in hepatic and serum ACE activity, Ang II degradation by hepatic and serum ACE2 and activation of the systemic RAS in response to the development of portal hypertension and vasodilatation [7], [42].",

However, there is limited understanding of the factors controlling Mas expression and its relationship to ACE2. In the present study, we showed that the transcription of Mas gene in the liver was very closely linked to ACE2 gene expression. This provides support for the concept of the development of an hepatic ACE2-Ang-(1\u20137)-Mas axis as liver fibrosis progresses in which increased Mas is available to transduce Ang-(1\u20137) signal [26]. Furthermore, Ang-(1\u20137) has been shown to be a vasodilator in a number of vascular beds [6], [43], [44], [45] and thus it might be expected to reduce intrahepatic tone in cirrhotic livers; an effect that might help counterbalance vasoconstriction mediated by locally generated vasoactive hormones such as endothelin 1 and Ang II. However, despite marked upregulation of Mas receptor expression, the present data showed that Ang-(1\u20137) does not elicit an intrahepatic vasodilator response in perfused BDL rat livers. Thus it appears that whilst the breakdown of locally produced Ang II by ACE2 may help protect the cirrhotic liver from Ang II mediated vasoconstriction and tissue injury, there is no detectable direct effect of Ang-(1\u20137) on sinusoidal resistance, possibly reflecting the known general impairment of NO dependent vasodilatation in the cirrhotic liver [46]. In contrast BDL livers were hyper-responsive to Ang II compared to those from healthy rats suggesting that our in situ perfusion model is appropriate to measure pressure changes in response to angiotensin peptides. This latter finding is also of interest given that the relative importance of Ang II as mediator of increased portal resistance has been questioned [47] based on a study of hepatic hemodynamics in isolated perfused cirrhotic rat livers which suggested that Ang II mediated vasoconstriction is attenuated in the cirrhotic liver [48].",

The changes in ACE2 expression were confined to the liver indicating that they represent a local response to liver injury and/or upregulation of the ACE-AT1 receptor axis of the RAS. These findings raise the possibility that upregulation of hepatic ACE2 and Mas, and the generation of Ang-(1\u20137) represent a counter-regulatory response to RAS-mediated liver injury. Whether, as in other organs [19], [29], manipulating this axis may affect tissue injury in chronic liver disease remains to be determined.",
