However, is was not a bunker built to house or hide citizens of the state or to protect the politicians who ordered its construction. It was an Atlas F missile silo, built in the early 1960s at a cost of approximately $15 million to United States taxpayers. It was one of 72 \u2018hardened\u2019 missile silo structures built from concrete mixed with an epoxy-based resin, protecting a nuclear-tipped Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICMB) one hundred times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The function of this bunker was therefore \u2018both defensive and offensive\u2026 based on a twofold logic of protected interiors and outward aggressiveness\u2019 (Monteyne, 2011: xix). Although this bunker was out of sight and out of mind to the average US citizen, it played a crucial role in a geopolitical agenda of extinction-level significance. Bunkers like these were, and are, as Ian Klinke has suggested, biopolitical spaces of extermination (Klinke, 2018: Ch 5).",

The Survival Condo, and hundreds of analogous experiments in communal bunkered living across the world, are thus built to function as a temporal bridge affording re-emergence into a new, and potentially improved, milieu, political situation, or environment after a disaster. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which many preppers were well prepared for, offers a unique opportunity to assess the motivations and methods of preppers. Ethnographic research about prepping dispels some of the unflattering media representations around the global prepper community and suggest many of thier practices may become normalised in the wake of the disaster. Thus, events like the 2020 pandemic offer fresh opportunities for new scholarship on the practice.",

Most existing ethnographic research into the practice, such as the work of Huddleston (2016), Mills, 2017, Mills, 2018, Mills, 2019, and Barker (2019) engaged with respondents who were prepping for \u2018low-level\u2019 events. The focus of this study was on the other end of the scale, whereas Kabel and Chmidling (2014: 258) write, \u2018\u2026modern day preppers build or purchase underground bunkers in which they can safely wait out the impending unrest and resurface at an undetermined point in the future\u2019. As a result, this research focuses on the materiality and temporality of space as much as on practices, since it involved working with preppers who are not just stockpiling goods but actively constructing new architectures for disaster. Before delving into these spaces, however, it is important to sketch out a social history of prepping.",

For Lapham, the dawn of the nuclear age corresponded to a powerful affective increase in inveterate dread, for not only did atomic weapons seem to embody transcendent power, they were a planetary force, a force that we simultaneously wielded and experienced as beyond our control and understanding. Nuclear dread was predicated on the possibility of extinction and as Thacker (2012: 144) writes, \u2018human extinction can never be fully comprehended, since it\u2019s very possibility presupposes the absolute negation of all thought.\u2019 In other words, the possibility triggering our own annihilation contradicted human instincts, causing mass panic and apathy in equal measure (see Bourke, 2006: 191).",

In 1956, President Eisenhower hosted the North American Summit Conference at the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Two years later, construction began underneath the hotel on large subterranean government bunker. Project Greek Island \u2013 as the 112,000-square-foot facility was code-named \u2013 was designed to house as many as 1100 people including 535 members of congress and their aides (Vanderbilt 2002: 135). It featured 18 dormitories, industrial kitchen facilities, a hospital, document vault, power systems, and a television broadcast studio. When President Kennedy took power soon after and became aware of just how proximal the nuclear threat was, he asked Congress to fund the construction of blast-resistant shelters for the general public. This initiative was squarely rejected in favour of a more modest programme focussed on locating and identifying areas that could be used as radiation fallout shelters.",

Two months later, Life Magazine\u2019s cover story gave instructions on how to survive nuclear fallout.

Much prepping, unlike survivalism, is not based on conspiracy but experience, and there is a \u2018distinct difference between such fringe elements of the past and the average prepper of today\u2019 (Huddleston, 2016: 241).

The collapse of supply lines, international travel and trade routes, economic systems, and social order during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic was a prime example of the kind of breakdown preppers were anticipating and had prepared for.

What Foster ultimately offers is a shallow and ambiguous caricature of the community that bears little reality of the everyday lives of preppers and conflates their activities with hoarding, which makes little sense, given how much time preppers spend carefully organizing and streamlining life-saving stockpiles.

This public-facing grassroots organisation focusses on \u2018self-organising in order to support established systems in order to withstand disturbances\u2019 (Huddleston, 2016: 240). The research undertaken by Mills was larger in scope, spanning eighteen US states and including thirty-nine people. Mills found that partisan politics play a key role in the ideologies undergirding prepping practices and provided grounded evidence regarding prepper's anxieties about the unknown (Mills, 2018, Mills, 2019). Most recently, Barker's extensive research, which involved in-depth interviews, participant observation of prepper meetups, and online analysis, provocatively suggests that in becoming resilient citizens, preppers are 'recuperating the agency of future temporalities, by finding empowerment, pleasure and vitality in moving closer to their metabolic vulnerability' (Barker, 2019: 11). All three researchers lament the lack of scholarly engagement with prepper communities, but Mills in particular calls for further research \u2018focussed on the movement\u2019s broad political character or guiding ideologies\u2019 (Mills, 2019: 6).

Dread is a dialectical sense of foreboding about an ambiguous object (p. 39) that we wish to see manifest because the possibility of its consequence is the possibility of freedom (p. 40\u201341). Whereas we are anxious about people, objects, events and things, dread is an ontological orientation we find ourselves in which cannot be attached to an object. The abyss that opens with dreadful awareness is alluring in promise. Trying to synthesise the affect creates a \u2018debility in which freedom swoons\u2019 (p. 55). According to Kierkegaard, dread does not \u2018tempt as a definite choice, but alarms and fascinates with its sweet anxiety. Thus, dread is the dizziness of freedom which occurs when\u2026 freedom then gazes down into its own possibility, grasping at finiteness to sustain itself\u2019 (p. 55).",

This state of fear is founded on an acknowledgment of the limits of human knowledge and impossibility of achieving mastery over our environment, but also stem from a sense that our creations have exceeded us and that we lack the political will to reign them back in. In the context of climate change, species-jumping viruses, biological engineering, or the disposal of nuclear waste, for instance, the environment itself has become a technical problem constantly in need of upgrade and repair, so that we will forevermore live in a state of permanent catastrophe to be managed rather than avoided (De Cauter, 2004: 100).

In this framing, dread is linked with millenarian apocalyptic ideologies of death and rebirth, where the frustration of choice results in a decision to fold to cosmic pressure and start again. The architecture of dread is thus also dialectical, in the sense that it promises both disaster and salvation. The bunker is built because \u2018it is only at the instant when salvation is actually posited that this dread is overcome\u2019 (Kierkegaard, 1968: 48).

Le Corbusier (1986 [1931]: 95, 240), who thought of buildings as machines for living in, wrote that \u2018we must use the results of modern technical triumphs to set man (sic) free\u2019. Though Le Corbuiser would have appreciated seeing people live above multi-story shopping malls connected by aerial skyways, creating what he called in The City of Tomorrow a \u2018theoretically water-tight formula\u2019 for urban planning, he would have been equally interested in the theoretically air-tight bunker, where waste has no place (see Pinder, 2006 for more on Le Corbusier\u2019s architectural and geographic imagination). Given the severe limitations of underground living, anything extraneous must be eliminated. The entire building must be thought of as a single unit, where the actions of each resident inevitably effects all other residents. This of course is what makes the bunker more like a submarine journey than a tower block: the elimination of external infrastructural support. In the event of a major incident, the umbilical cord to the world on the other side of the blast doors would be snipped and the clock would start ticking to a resupply.",

The temporality of the bunker is embodied in the material substance of the space, the hardened architecture and stores and stocks, but is equally about cultivating a socially copacetic environment in the bunker . Hall explained that,In sociology there\u2019s a structure defined as an extended family \u2013 it\u2019s a group of more than 20 people but less than 120 that share close proximity and a common goal. With fewer than 20, you don\u2019t get your societal needs met and you really don\u2019t want those people to be family members, because you also need to interact with strangers in order to have your societal needs met. And if you got over 120 cliques started to form. This is a 54,000 ft.2 facility with a common goal of survival. In terms of sociability and productivity we got the optimal setup.

During that experiment, Larry explained \u2018they almost got into a serious situation because somebody got sick and had to be taken out and no one else knew how to run the pumps\u2019 (see Alling et al., 1993). Thus, it was crucial that everyone share information about jobs and roles. In fact, Larry explained, they had hired a consultant who had worked on Biosphere 2 to assist in the planning of the Survival Condo:She went over everything in meticulous detail, from the frequency to the textures to the colours on the walls. All the LED lights in the bunker are set to 3000\u00b0 Kelvin to prevent depression. People come in here and they want to know why people need all this \u2018luxury\u2019 \u2013 the cinema, rock climbing wall, table tennis, video games. shooting range, sauna, library and everything, but what they don\u2019t get is that this isn\u2019t about luxury, this stuff is key to survival.If you don\u2019t have all this built in, your brain keeps subconscious score of abnormal things and you start to get varying degrees of depression or cabin fever. Whether you\u2019re woodworking or just taking the dog for a walk, it\u2019s crucial to people feeling that living in relatively normal life, even if the world is burning outside.

Equally, by expanding optics on the materiality of the bunker to give serious consideration to the social forces behind contemporary underground construction, and the completely rational retreat into them during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes clear that the preppers are not social anomalies, but gatekeepers to understanding the contemporary human condition (Garrett, 2020). Spaces like the Survival Condo seem improbable, if not impossible, and yet as Kierkegaard writes, dread spawns from the possible and \u2018possibility means I can\u2019 (Dru, 1938, p. 44). It\u2019s the choice to act that matters; in action hope can spawn from dread, as Larry Hall suggested at the end of our tour when he told me:This was not a space of hope. The defensive capability of this structure only existed to the extent needed to protect a weapon, a missile \u2013 this bunker was a weapon system.
