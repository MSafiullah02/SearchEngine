Patients are frequently confined in crowded, difficult to clean environments, where they may undergo invasive procedures, be fitted with prosthetic devices, and require broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics or immunosuppressive therapies. These conditions provide ideal opportunities for the adaptation and spread of pathogenic microorganisms, such as methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, vancomycin\u2010resistant enterococci and multi\u2010resistant Acinetobacter species. Pathogens circulating in the general community also enter the hospital and exploit the crowded conditions to spread rapidly within the hospital population. Examples include community\u2010type MRSA, norovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus.\n4\n Some infections are also caused by an admitted patient's own bacterial flora (endogenous infections), due to processes that compromise defences against invasion and infection.",

The process of coughing or sneezing creates droplets of varying size that may be expelled at high velocity across distances up to 6 m, which may facilitate distant transfer of any respiratory infective agent. Furthermore, in low\u2010humidity (e.g. air conditioned) environments, larger droplets may evaporate to form droplet nuclei that remain airborne for extended periods. Whether true airborne transmission of infection occurs depends on such variables as the infectious dose of an agent, the delivered dose to the recipient and what degree of pre\u2010existing immunity the recipient has. The microbes that are most efficiently disseminated by the airborne mode (e.g. tuberculosis, measles, varicella) remain viable in droplet nuclei and have a very low infectious dose in a susceptible individual. In low\u2010humidity environments, influenza more usually spread by \u2018droplet\u2019 may also be spread over short distances via the airborne route as shown from animal studies.\n16\n\n",
