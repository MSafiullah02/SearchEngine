The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) then limited in-hospital personnel to essential providers only. On March 15th, UCSF instituted a hospital-wide visitor ban with exceptions for patients at the end of life. Personal protective equipment (PPE) scarcity then prompted calls for minimizing in-person visits by providers. Finally, on March 16th, UCSF opened its first closed COVID-19/respiratory illness unit with 31 negative pressure rooms. In the setting of these rapid and unprecedented changes, our Inpatient Palliative Care Services (PCS) team recognized that telepalliative medicine consultation would be critical to protect providers, limit PPE use, and provide adequate services to patients throughout the hospital and especially within closed COVID-19 units.",

It is helpful to create or repurpose educational materials (many already exist for the outpatient setting) to introduce patients to videoconferencing and how/when palliative providers might contact them remotely. Many patients have personal smart phones/devices, and these can be leveraged when hospital-provided technology is not available. Finally, videoconferencing can be used both for fully remote consultation as well as by in-person providers to include remote team members or family members.",

In palliative medicine, we rely heavily on non-verbal cues to guide us in redirecting conversations and responding to emotions. Many of the techniques we turn to, including touch and even the act of sitting down with a patient, are not available to us via telemedicine. Some consults will still require in-person consultation, for example when patients are hard of hearing, unable to use technology, or require physical examination. However, in most cases, PC providers can apply their skills of listening, perceiving, and connecting via video. Telepalliative skills are novel and take time to develop. And yet, telemedicine is a powerful tool that can promote good communication and high-quality care.",

Preventing provider illness enables individuals to continue to provide care and preserves our most precious resource: the limited palliative medicine workforce. Moreover, remote consultation decreases PPE use and ensures first responders and bedside providers are protected for the duration of this crisis.
