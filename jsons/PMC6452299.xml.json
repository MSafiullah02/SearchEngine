Other parameters of disease severity were also collected in inpatients, including oxygen administration, PICU admission, need and duration of noninvasive and invasive positive pressure ventilation, and duration of hospitalization. The CDSS comprised 5 parameters, each ranking from 0 to 3, and included respiratory rate, auscultation, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, retractions, and level of activity (mainly assessed by feeding difficulty). The total score ranked from 0 (normal) to 15 (most abnormal) (Supplementary Table 1) [6, 7, 14]. Demographic and clinical information, including follow-up telephone calls at 2 and 4 weeks after discharge, were collected using standardized questionnaires designed for portable tablets, and information was automatically transferred to a secure database (REDCap) [15].",

Mixed-effects linear regression models were built to assess the rate of VL and CDSS change over time, adjusted for duration of symptoms before enrollment. Two preplanned interaction effect models were constructed to determine whether the rate of change in VL differed by hospital unit or by duration of symptoms before enrollment. Sensitivity analyses were performed ad hoc to assess the potential effect of systemic steroids on VL decay and the CDSS. Raw data were used to calculate VL and CDSS area under the curve (AUC) using the midpoint rule, and group differences in AUC were assessed using 2-sample t tests, with a Satterthwaite correction for unequal group variance. Last, to determine which factors were predictive of worse clinical outcomes, we used multivariable logistic regression with Firth penalized likelihood when warranted to avoid small sample size bias. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software), with a 2-sided P value < .05 considered statistically significant.",

The CDSS decreased approximately 1.4 units per day from baseline (P < .0001) when all inpatients were analyzed together.

However, when sequential data were analyzed, and adjusted for steroid use, higher VLs were also present in ward vs PICU infants at all time-points evaluated, and independently associated with lower supplemental oxygen needs. On the other hand, VL decay in PICU infants was delayed, especially in children treated with steroids, who also had evidence of worse disease at enrollment.

In the outpatient population, there is limited information on the influence of RSV loads on disease severity, and the data derived from hospitalized children with severe disease are conflicting. It is possible that during severe disease some components of the inflammatory cascade elicit a more vigorous response, which could favor viral clearance and at the same time contribute to a more severe clinical disease phenotype. On the other hand, it could also be possible that higher RSV loads promote an early robust innate immune response that can protect from disease progression. Supporting the latter, and in agreement with our findings, a recent study conducted in older infants with RSV infection showed that those with milder disease not requiring hospitalization had higher RSV loads, and that VL was significantly correlated with mucosal concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines [5, 20].",

Those studies found that VL on day 3 of admission was associated with worse disease severity as defined by a clinical score [26], PICU admission, or respiratory failure [10], which differs from our findings. In those 2 studies, however, the duration of hospitalization was longer, from 6 to 7 days (compared with 2.3 days in our study), steroid use during hospitalization was not mentioned, and analyses were not adjusted for duration of symptoms, suggesting that the study population and inpatient management strategies differ between institutions. A recent study evaluated sequential VL and cytokine concentrations and mucosal gene expression profiling in 30 infants hospitalized with RSV LRTI. The study showed that intubated infants had lower VL and reduced interferon and CCL5/RANTES concentrations than children with moderate disease [27]. Although the study was small, not adjusted for steroid use, and included children with comorbidities, our findings agree with those of this latter study.

Moreover, steroid use is not mentioned in the majority of studies that have analyzed RSV load dynamics. Although with the current study design it not possible to determine whether steroids are responsible for the slower viral decay, indicative of sicker children, or a combination of both, our study suggests that this is an important cofounding factor [5, 6, 27] that may have contributed to the differences observed.",

We did not perform sequential sampling in outpatients with milder RSV infection and thus the description of this cohort provides a snapshot of a continuous event. Nevertheless, these patients were contacted after enrollment, and none of them required hospitalization, confirming that their classification was appropriate. Another limitation is the small number of children enrolled with <3 days of symptoms. This is an intrinsic limitation of this disease and the current standard of care for children with mild respiratory infections. As mentioned before, there were significant age differences between outpatients and hospitalized infants. However, sensitivity analyses with age-matched inpatients and outpatients were conducted, confirming the results, and age was included as a key covariate in all multivariable models.",
