It was possible to taper the dose further to TW in 57% of cats completing the study. A similar frequency of dose tapering was previously reported in cats suffering from idiopathic pruritus, eosinophilic plaque, indolent ulcer and/or linear granuloma. 2 Vercelli et al. 2 showed that following 8 weeks during which cats received an inducing dose of ciclosporin, the dose could be administered TW in 73% of the cats and EoD in 36% of the cats. Overall, it would appear that the frequency of dose tapering is overestimated if based on the cat population remaining in the study, but underestimated if based on the initial population included into the study. In a clinical study, the frequency of treatment interruption may be higher than in general practice conditions, because cats belonging to owners not complying with the protocol will be withdrawn. Furthermore, it should be noted that the frequency of dose tapering observed in a clinical study may not predict precisely what will be observed in clinical practice. In a clinical trial, strict and standardized rules are given to taper the dose, while in clinical practice, dose adjustment may be based on various considerations, including but not limited to clinical improvement. In addition, in this clinical trial, ciclosporin was generally used as monotherapy and the use of concomitant medications was restricted as much as possible. Cats treated in clinical practice may receive adjunct therapies that may contribute to clinical improvement. It is also likely that owner compliance to treatment is better in a clinical trial compared with clinical practice, because owner compliance is regularly monitored and drug accountability assessed. All these factors may contribute to the response to ciclosporin treatment and therefore affect the frequency of dose tapering. However, in a large proportion of cats in this study, the dose could be tapered to EoD and even TW without deterioration of the clinical response. In addition, a per protocol analysis was carried out to assess the influence of prohibited concurrent medications and noncompliance to the treatment administration or treatment regimen on the outcome.

Different algorithms were used in clinical studies to decide on the change of dose in dogs and cats. In dogs, the change of dosing frequency was guided by the relative improvement of the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index 11 lesion score over baseline, while in cats the change of dosing regimen was based on the overall clinical assessment made by the investigator. The dose could be tapered when a good or excellent response was obtained, which corresponds approximately to a 50% improvement of the lesion score and pruritus. 7 The same threshold was selected in dog studies for changing the dosing regimen. 12, 13 It could have been expected that the frequency of dose reduction would be lower in cats than in dogs. In cats, the dose could not be tapered when moderate or severe pruritus was still exhibited, whilst in dogs a reduction of the lesion score was sufficient for dose tapering even with persistent pruritus. Pharmacokinetic features of ciclosporin in dogs and cats may explain the difference in dose-tapering frequency. In cats, blood concentrations at the same dose of ciclosporin tend to be comparatively higher than in dogs. 14, 15 However, the concentration of ciclosporin needed to inhibit the expression of immunomodulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-2, interleukin-4 and interferon-c, from peripheral blood mononuclear cell appears to be higher in cats than in dogs. 16, 17 More information on the precise mode of action of ciclosporin in the skin and on the crucial target cells would be needed for the interpretation of this difference.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 886, "end": 887, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 968, "end": 971, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 972, "end": 974, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1504, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1505, "end": 1507, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1754, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1757, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The dose-tapering regimen was, initially, similar for all four types of lesions observed, but the complete resolution of lesions was less frequent in cats suffering from self-induced alopecia than other types of lesions.

It is possible that excessive grooming associated with behavioural disorders 19, 20 may have contributed to the perpetuation of the alopecia. Severe prolonged pruritus can induce a state of anxiety and behavioural problems, 21 forming a vicious cycle.

It is also noteworthy that the clinical response remained stable after dose tapering independent from the previous treatment received in Phase 1.

Toxoplasmosis in association with ciclosporin monotherapy has been anecdotally reported. [22] [23] [24] [25] Cats that are seronegative for T. gondii may be at risk of developing clinical toxoplasmosis if they become infected while undergoing treatment with ciclosporin. Potential exposure of seronegative cats or cats suspected to be seronegative to T. gondii should therefore be minimized (e.g. keep indoors, avoid feeding raw meat or scavenging). The possible exacerbation of a preexisting serious systemic disease (e.g. feline infectious peritonitis) is consistent with the known pharmacology of this class of drug. In cases of clinical toxoplasmosis or other serious systemic illness, treatment with ciclosporin should be withdrawn and appropriate therapy initiated. Ciclosporin is an inhibitor of the MDR1 P-glycoprotein transporter. Coadministration of ciclosporin with Pglycoprotein substrates, such as macrocyclic lactones, could therefore potentially decrease the efflux of such drugs from blood-brain barrier cells, potentially resulting in signs of central nervous system toxicity. In this study, cats were required to have been treated with a flea adulticide to rule out flea allergy as a cause of their allergic disease. Twenty-eight cats that were subsequently treated with ciclosporin received concomitant treatment with a macrocyclic lactone (27 were treated with selamectin and one cat received milbemycin and praziquantel). Approximately 70% of these 28 cats experienced an AE (primarily digestive tract disorders). One cat treated with selamectin was reported to have convulsions. The convulsions were attributed to possible chronic renal disease, and the cat was continued with ciclosporin off study with no further reports. While the number of animals on both ci-closporin and macrocyclic lactone therapy was limited and extrapolations should be made with caution, there did not appear to be an association between the concomitant use of these drugs and reports of neurological AEs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 217, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 218, "end": 222, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 228, "end": 232, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, these results suggest that the inducing dose of 7 mg/kg ciclosporin can be tapered as soon as 4 weeks without deterioration of clinical response.
