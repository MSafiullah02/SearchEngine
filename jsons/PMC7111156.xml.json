Steroid use increases the blood level of fat, which induces microcontusions, leading to osteonecrosis.5 Delanois and colleagues12 reported that 20 of 24 subjects with traumatic talar osteonecrosis had a history of steroid therapy.

However, some cases had loosening at the fixation site. In 2004, the second-generation implant was designed as a talar body prosthesis without a bone peg and was expected to perform the bearing function on the talar body. However, talar head rupture occurred in some cases because of higher pressure to the talar head. Therefore, total talar prosthesis was developed in 2005 and has been used since. In this article, diagnosis and treatment of talar osteonecrosis, as well as surgical technique for artificial talus implantation, are discussed.",

Tibiocalcaneal fusion connecting the tibia and calcaneus after resecting the collapsed talar body usually results in length discrepancy of the lower legs. Blair fusion connecting the tibia and talar neck with the fibula results in less discrepancy; however, long-term mounting of the external fixator is required to address instability in the fixation site.13, 14 Recently introduced artificial talar prostheses prevent leg length discrepancy, preserve the joint function, and allow early weightbearing.15, 16\n",

The talar body is cut 1-cm thick on the coronal plane, dissecting the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament. Removal of the entire bone fragment without retaining small fragments in the surgical site is important. After irrigation of the surgical site, the artificial talus is inserted with assistance of foot traction. The ankle, subtalar, and talonavicular joints are ranged to confirm good prosthetic fit. The surgical wound is closed following joint capsule repair (Fig. 6\n). A below-knee walking cast is applied for 3 weeks. Weightbearing is avoided in the first week, partial weightbearing is allowed in the second week, and full weightbearing is allowed in the third week (Fig. 7\n).",
