            "text": "We have recently reported on the 18 amino acid long P\u20104 domain of PvTRAg38, which binds to human erythrocytes, as well as to the purified band 3 protein 22. To further narrow down the erythrocyte binding activity of the P\u20104 domain, mutated peptides were synthesized where three consecutive amino acid residues were systematically replaced by three alanine residues and were then used in erythrocyte binding assays. Cellular ELISA results (Table 1) showed that replacing first three amino acids of peptide P\u20104 with three alanine residues resulted in the abolition of its erythrocyte binding activity. Restoring these first three amino acid residues to wild\u2010type but mutating the next three amino acid residues to alanines did not restore its binding activity. This abolition of erythrocyte binding activity continued until the 12th amino acid residue of P4 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). However, replacement of three amino acid residues at positions 13\u201315th or thereafter resulted in the restoration of its erythrocyte binding activity. These results therefore eliminated the possibility of the last six amino acids of P\u20104 being involved in erythrocyte binding. Similar results were obtained when these mutated peptides were allowed to compete with PvTRAg38 expressed on the surface of CHO\u2010K1 cells for erythrocyte binding by the rosetting assay (Fig. 1A). These results obtained from two different assays indicate that the first 12 amino acid residues (amino acid residues 197\u2013208) of this P\u20104 peptide domain are important for erythrocyte binding activity.",

Cellular ELISA results showed that the erythrocyte binding activity was reduced when certain amino acid residues within this 12 amino acid region were replaced by alanine (Table 2). Analogous to the binding experiment by cellular ELISA, we performed a binding inhibition experiment where binding of erythrocytes (rosetting) to CHO\u2010K1 cells expressing PvTRAg38 competed with the wild\u2010type peptide and its mutated forms. Here, mutated peptides showed trends similar to those observed in cellular ELISA (Fig. 1B). Out of 12 amino acid residues in this peptide domain, erythrocyte binding activity was markedly affected (40\u201350% reduction) by five amino acids (W198, V199, K202, N203, R207). The maximum effect on erythrocyte binding activity was observed when an asparagine residue was replaced with alanine (N203A). Replacement of the first and last amino acids of this 12 amino acid TP\u20104 peptide with alanine had a minimal effect on its erythrocyte binding activity.",

This pattern was similar to that of the erythrocyte binding activity of these mutated peptides. Replacement of asparagine with alanine (peptide AVII) also showed a maximum reduction in the binding activity of this mutated peptide with respect to the purified band 3 protein compared to the wild\u2010type peptide. Band 3 binding activity of mutated peptides AIII and AXI, where valine and arginine were replaced by alanine, respectively, was also maximally affected compared to the wild\u2010type peptide.

            "text": "The results reported above show that PvTRAg38 binds to band 3 of the host erythrocyte via multiple sites of its 12 amino acid peptide domain. Previously, we have shown that peptide P\u20104 from PvTRAg38 interacts with three different ectodomains of band 3 (fragments B3F1, B3F3 and B3F6) 22. Here, we performed an interaction between these three band 3 fragments and the mutated peptides by solid phase\u2010ELISA, as well as by SPR, aiming to identify the critical amino acid residues involved in the interaction with band 3 ectodomains. We observed that majority of the amino acids of this 12 amino acid domain were interacting with the specific individual loops of band 3 in both the assays [i.e. by solid phase ELISA (Fig. 2) and by SPR (Table 3)]. The binding of mutated peptides with B3F1 was maximally affected when amino acids at positions 199 (V199A, peptide AIII), 200 (Q200A, peptide AIV) or 203 (N203A, peptide AVII) of the P4 domain were replaced by alanine (Fig. 2). Mutation K202A (peptide AVI), K205A (peptide AIX) and R207A (peptide AXI) in TP\u20104 also affected its interaction with B3F1. Similar results were obtained by SPR analysis where mutated peptides AIII, AIV and AVII showed an approximately 10 000\u2010fold reduction in binding affinity towards B3F1, whereas AVI, AIX and AXI showed an approximately 100\u20131000\u2010fold reduction in this binding affinity compared to the wild\u2010type TP\u20104 (Table 3). In the case of B3F3, the interaction of mutated peptide AI (K197A) was affected more compared to amino acid mutations at positions 199 (V199A, peptide AIII) or 207 (R207A, peptide AXI) by solid phase ELISA (Fig. 2). However, the SPR data showed almost similar binding affinity for these three peptides to B3F3, which was reduced to approximately 100\u2010fold compared to the wild\u2010type peptide TP\u20104 (Table 3). Binding of mutated peptides with B3F6 was maximally affected at the amino acids positions 198 (W198A, peptide AII), 201 (W201A, peptide AV), 203 (N203A, peptide AVII) or 207 (R207A, peptide AXI) by solid phase ELISA (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained by SPR where these mutated peptides showed an approximately 100\u20131000\u2010fold reduction in binding affinity to B3F6 compared to wild\u2010type TP\u20104 (Table 3). Mutation I206A (peptide AX) had also slightly affected this binding in both of the assays. These results indicate that each ectodomain of band 3 was recognized by specific amino acids located at certain positions of PvTRAg38, except V1199 and N203, which bind to two loops, and R207, which interacts to all three ectodomains of Band 3. This one\u2010to\u2010one interaction indicated by the SPR data also correlates well with the erythrocyte binding activity of these mutated peptides.",

Recently, we have shown that the P. vivax tryptophan\u2010rich antigen PvTRAg38 18, 21, 22 is involved in the host\u2013parasite interaction, and band 3 present on the human erythrocytes also acts as one of its receptors 22. We had also defined an 18 amino acid long P\u20104 peptide domain with sequence KWVQWKNDKIRSWLSSEW at amino acid positions 197\u2013214 of PvTRAg38, which interacted with three different ectodomains of Band 3. Here, we have further defined this domain to 12 amino acid residues (peptide TP\u20104) by alanine scanning and showed that the last six amino acids of the P\u20104 peptide are not essential for binding (Table 1). The binding activities of wild\u2010type P\u20104 and TP\u20104 were almost comparable. However, changing any triplet in TP\u20104 caused a drastic reduction in the binding activity of this mutated peptide compared to the binding activity displayed by the mutant peptide with a single amino acid change in the same triplet. This appears to be the result of an additive effect. Furthermore, we show here that five amino acid residues of PvTRAg 38, located within the TP\u20104 domain, were more critical for binding to erythrocytes and were interacting differently with three ectodomains of band 3 (Fig. 2 and Table 3). An asparagine residue (N203) of this 12 amino acid domain was more critical for binding than any other amino acid residue. This is because mutation of this residue (peptide AVII) resulted in a loss of the maximum erythrocyte binding activity (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The probable reason for this could be attributed to its stronger interaction observed with two different ectodomains (loop 1 and loop 6) of band 3 protein in SPR (Table 3). Although peptide AIII with the V199A mutation also interacts with two loops (loop 1 and loop 3), its erythrocyte binding activity was affected to a lesser extent than that of the peptide AVII with the N203A mutation. This difference in erythrocyte binding activity could be attributed to the weaker interaction of this peptide (AIII) with loop 3 than loop 1 of band 3 compared to the mutated peptide AVII, which interacts strongly with both loops (loop 1 and loop 6) of band 3 (Table 3). The glutamine residue of this 12 amino acid peptide domain was interacting with loop 1 of band 3 because its mutation caused a drastic reduction in K\nD values in SPR, although this did not affect erythrocyte binding activity proportionately. The other mutated peptides interacting with the single loop also showed a minimum effect on erythrocyte binding activity, except for AII (W198A), which also interacts with single loop (loop 6) but had affected the erythrocyte binding activity more than the other mutated peptides binding to a single loop. Indeed, the effect of the W198A mutation on the erythrocyte binding activity of this mutated peptide (AII) was same as in the case of the R207A mutation (peptide AVI), although the latter was interacting with all three loops. Mutant peptides where the above mentioned five amino acids were replaced with alanine showed a reduced affinity for at least one of the band 3 loops, thus accounting for the corresponding reduced red blood cell (RBC) binding. The only mutant peptide (AI) that had a reduced affinity for loop 3 only in SPR was unable to affect RBC binding.",

At the binding interface of the protein\u2013protein interaction, the probability of having tryptophan residues is maximal compared to other amino acids 36. There are a number of studies where tryptophan residues play an important role in biochemical and biological function. In Plasmodium, the PHIST domains of PHISTa family members contain two positionally conserved tryptophan residues, and one of them plays an important role in its interaction with host erythrocyte cytoskeletal protein band 4.1 37. In members of class I cytokine receptor superfamily, the tryptophan rich motif WXXW/WSXWS is involved in various functions, including ligand binding 38. The binding region of TP\u20104 of PvTRAg38 also contains the WXXW motif, which could have provided an anchoring role for its binding with band 3. In host\u2013parasite interactions, conserved tryptophan rich motifs are involved in membrane infusion of HIV virus 39, 40, SARS virus 41 and Ebola virus 42. In the present context, we do not know whether the tryptophan residues of PvTRAg38 are involved in such a function, although we may speculate that they help the parasite to fuse with erythrocyte membrane during invasion of the host cell by the merozoite.",
