We found high and fluctuating levels of these cytokines in his peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and pleural fluid. However, these levels correlated only inconsistently with the treatments we administered, even for plasmapheresis, which was intended to dilute circulating cytokines, and for a dialysis filter that was designed to adsorb cytokines ( Figure) . In addition, these cytokine levels correlated inconsistently with his clinical course, except that the levels increased dramatically in the last days before he died.",

We measured IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that were higher than the corresponding serum levels. On one occasion (7 March), the IL-6 level was approximately 10 times higher. This difference is even more remarkable because the process of collecting bronchoalveolar fluid dilutes the specimen. In addition, the level of IL-6 in pleural effusion was higher than the corresponding serum levels on the 2 times we measured it. If these observations indicate a cytokine storm, we propose that the local storm may be worse than the systemic storm.",

As a result, we wonder whether tocilizumab would have affected the IL-6 levels we observed and whether it might have improved this patient's disease course, especially because others have reported that as COVID-19 progresses to its middle and late stages, the expression of inflammatory cytokines is related to the severity of the disease (4). On the basis of our experience, we encourage additional research to determine whether inflammatory cytokines in the lungs predict the clinical course of COVID-19 and whether these cytokines should be a target for intervention and treatment.",
