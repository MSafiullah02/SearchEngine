To get round this problem, Fujiwara's group is developing new 'terahertz' technology using high-field dynamic nuclear polarization. In this technique, electron spins, which are very much more sensitive to irradiation, are energized by terahertz-frequency radiation and used indirectly to excite nuclear spins in the sample at very low temperature. This has allowed accurate measurements of microgram quantities of protein, rather than the tens of milligrams normally needed, at sensitivities up to 100-1000 times that previously possible.",

AIST Kansai is no exception.The AIST institute is Japan's largest public research organization, employing about 3,000 researchers at nine locations throughout the country and hosting almost 5,000 visiting scientists from universities and industry in Japan and overseas.\"I was appointed president of AIST in April 2009 after serving as chairman of the board of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, \" says Tamotsu Nomakuchi. \"Needless to say, sales and profits are important in industry. But AIST's role is to define and solve problems, anticipate future industrial needs and develop innovative technology for a sustainable society. \" 'Medicine' and 'engineering' are keywords that define research conducted at AIST Kansai on maintaining and promoting good health in an ageing society. \"Life sciences, and in particular, medical engineering, form the basis of multidisciplinary research at AIST Kansai, \" says Nomakuchi. This research is carried out at the Research Institute for Cell Engineering (RICE), the Health Technology Center and the Institute for Human Science and Biomedical Engineering (HSBE).\"At AIST, I want to use my experience of working in industry, and I hope to act as a bridge connecting industry and academia in Osaka as well as other AIST centres in the rest of Japan, \" says Nomakuchi.Masayuki Kamimoto, director of AIST Kansai, is proud of his centre's multidisciplinary capacity. \"In addition to life sciences, we also have research projects in areas including the environment, energy, information technology and materials science, \" he says. Recent internationally recognized breakthroughs by researchers at AIST Kansai include cell cultivation protocols, carbonnanotube molecular actuators and biomarkers for Parkinson's disease.",

Hajime Ohgushi, director of the Research Institute for Cell Engineering, is addressing this problem using stem cells for 'regenerative medicine' .\"I use mesenchymal stem cells, which exist in bone marrow, to repair damaged bone tissue, \" says Ohgushi. \"This is my contribution to regenerative medicine. \"In 2005, Ohgushi and his group reported pioneering work on the regeneration of bone tissue using tissue-engineered bone derived from the patient's own mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).However, in spite of the tremendous advances as a result of this work, clinical applications of this approach were limited because the ability of the cells to proliferate and differentiate declined dramatically over time.\"We succeeded in activating the MSCs by introducing NANOG or SOX2 -genes expressed by embryonic stem cells -into the MSCs, \" says Ohgushi. Introduction of only the SOX2 gene was ineffective, and a combination of SOX2 and a protein called basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) was required.\"In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka reported that introducing 3-4 transcription factors into the skin cells of an adult led to these skin cells gaining pluripotency like embryonic stem cells, \" says Ohgushi. \"This report was the birth of induced pluripotent stems cells, or iPS cells. We also succeeded in generating iPS cells from MSCs, therefore the technology may be available for regenerative medicine based on MSCs. \"",

EAP actuators are operated by applying a voltage to move and bend sheets of polymer actuators. \"Conventional polymer actuators rely on chemical reactions within liquid electrolytes to convert the applied voltage into mechanical motion, \" says Asaka. \"They have short lifetimes and slow response times. \"In Asaka's approach, movement is produced by changing the internal volume of a polymer composite. \"We mix millimetre-sized, single-walled carbon nanotubes with an ionic liquid to produce a gel that is dried to form highly conductive, free-standing sheets, \" says Asaka.The actuators were produced by cutting fifteen 1 mm strips from the carbon nanotubes, sandwiching a soft polymer film between the strips, and finally applying an alternating voltage across the carbon-nanotube electrodes.",

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder in which dopamine-producing brain cells are lost. The disease affects millions of people worldwide, and comes with symptoms that include trembling hands, stiff limbs and inability to balance.\"We are developing protocols for early diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease based on the detection of biomarkers, \" says Yasukazu Yoshida at the Health Technology Research Center.Yoshida's team found the gene PARK7 (DJ-1) to be critical for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The next step for the researchers was to develop a means of detecting this biomarker in blood samples. \"We successfully prepared a monoclonal antibody and developed a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for an oxidized form of DJ-1, known as Cys-106-oxidized DJ-1, \" says Yoshida.The concentration of oxidized DJ-1 in blood samples of unmedicated Parkinson's disease patients was about ten times greater than that detected in control and medicated patients. \"Future plans include improving the performance of the measurement system and introducing this technology into hospitals for actual clinical applications, \" says Yoshida. \"We also want to establish our approach as an international standard for diagnosing Parkinson's disease. \"",

His group is at the forefront of developing technology for diagnosis and sensory prosthesis support for people with higher brain dysfunctions, such as dementia and language difficulties. \"We are trying to unlock the mysteries of the brain using our integrated non-invasive brain imaging technique, \" says Iwaki. \"It is extremely important to elucidate not only 'where and when' but also 'how' various parts of the brain interact. \"Iwaki's group has combined magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with innovative information algorithms to allow non-invasive imaging of the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. MEG detects magnetic signals from neural networks in the brain, EEG maps changes in electric potential over the scalp due to neuron activity, and fMRI detects brain activity by the degree of oxygenation of the blood. A system integrating these three analyses has been used to identify the neurophysiological mechanism of bone-conducted ultrasound (BCU) -the detection of sounds above 20 kHz not directly discernable by humans. \"The BCU experiments led to the development of a BCU hearing aid, \" says Seiji Nakagawa, senior research scientist at the HSBE institute. \"Our trials showed that 30% of profoundly deaf people could hear simple words, and more than half perceived some form of sound. In the future, we hope to commercialize this technology. \"The BCU hearing aid could replace cochlear implants, which require time-consuming and physiologically taxing surgical procedures.Non-invasive brain imaging system. A combination of MEG, EEG and fMRI analyses allows visualization of spatiotemporal neural dynamics (top) and neural interactions (bottom). ",
