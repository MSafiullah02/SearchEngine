Other viruses that cause myocarditis are adenovirus and influenza viruses. Parvovirus B19 infection is associated sometimes with myocarditis. Members of the Herpesviridae family, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) have been associated occasionally with myocarditis. During an atypical outbreak of acute febrile syndrome, eight children, with ages from 5 months to 15 years, died in cardiogenic shock due to myocarditis in July-August 2005, in the city of Havana, Cuba. Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and nested reverse transcription-PCR (nRT-PCR) were carried out on fresh heart muscle and lung tissue to analyze the genomic sequences of adenovirus, CMV, HHV-6, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varizella zoster virus, influenza virus A, B, C, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronavirus, flaviruses and enteroviruses. Evidence was for the presence of the adenovirus genome in 6 (75%) of the children. Phylogenetic analyses of a conserved hexon gene fragment in four cases showed serotype 5 as the causal agent. No others viruses were detected. Histological examination was undertaken to detect myocardial inflammation.",

Etiologically, the relevant factors are the direct or indirect influence of infectious pathogens or toxic, chemical or physical agents, allergic-hyperergic reactions and myocardial inflammatory events in the context of systemic diseases [Feldman and McNamara, 2000 ]. An infectious cause of myocarditis is usually suspected when unexplained heart failure or arrhythmia occurs in a person with a febrile illness or upper respiratory tract infection. Acute myocarditis is typically sporadic, although clusters have been reported during outbreaks of viral disease [Helin et al., 1968; Woodruff, 1980] . Viral myocarditis shows different clinical features, depending on the age of the patient. In pediatric patients, viral myocarditis can present as acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and in older patients, it presents often as chronic, slowly progressive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy . Myocardial biopsy specimens used for pathological examination, the conventional standard for diagnosis, have been considered difficult to collect in nonfatal cases [Fowles and Mason, 1982; Billingham, 1990] . Developments in molecular biology techniques have helped to establish a viral etiology in patients with myocarditis. In situ hybridization and PCR remain the most reliable diagnostic tools for confirming viral heart disease, and PCR is ideal to confirm viral persistence in the myocardium of patients with myocarditis [Baboonian and Treasure, 1997] .",

Generally, onethird of the patients recover the full cardiac function, one-third of the patients develop chronic heart failure, and one-third either require cardiac transplantation or die [Wheeler and Kooy, 2003] . The true incidence of pediatric viral myocarditis is unknown because many cases are asymptomatic initially and, therefore, unrecognized. Frequency and identification of infectious agents in cases with myocarditis have varied widely from 10% to 100% [Feldman and McNamara, 2000; Vare et al., 2000; Bowles et al., 2003; Huhn et al., 2005] . The data presented in this demonstrate that in children with acute myocarditis that progressed to death, adenoviral DNA can be detected in a significant proportion of cases (six of eight, 75%). However, this is not surprising; there are similar reports from pediatric patients with myocarditis in whom adenoviral DNA have been detected [Bowles et al., , 2002 [Bowles et al., , 2003 Vare et al., 2000] .",

It is possible that in this study the two cases with PCR-negative myocarditis might be explained by noninfectious in nature or by a causative role of less common cardiotropic viruses that were not investigated.

Five cases (62.5%) presented underlying medical conditions. With a diagnosis of myocarditis, it is important to consider whether there is an underlying condition causing myocarditis. The list of possible underlying conditions mentioned in various sources for myocarditis includes: bacterial infection, viral infection (enteroviruses, adenoviruses), autoimmune myocarditis, rheumatic fever, Q fever, scrub typhus, Chagas disease, Toxoplasmosis, radiotherapy, and certain medications. Adenovirus infections can range in severity from unapparent or mild clinical illness to severe, life-threatening disease. Thus, the majority of adenovirus infections are self-limited, with severe or disseminated disease occurring sporadically in immunocompromised patients (e.g., infants), patients with AIDS, transplant recipients, and those with underlying disease [Carrigan, 1997; Hong et al., 2001; La Rosa et al., 2001] . Since myocarditis is an inflammatory disease in which infectious agents and immunological disorders go hand in hand. The pathophysiological mechanisms represent a critical area for investigation. Individual genetic variation, specific viral properties, or both are accepted as candidate mechanisms [Liu et al., 2006] .",

Posi- Negative Negative tive serological tests cannot prove viral infection of the myocardium. In this report, the polymerase chain reaction identified adenovirus as the unique agent in the myocardium of Cuban children with myocarditis. The classification of adenoviruses into serotypes is based on virus isolation, followed by neutralization tests with type-specific sera, and may take several weeks, which limits the clinical value of this approach, especially in the management of immunocompromised patients. There is a growing clinical interest in serotype determination of clinical isolates since it is becoming increasingly clear that specific serotypes are associated with the manifestation and severity of the disease presentation [Takeuchi et al., 1999; Fujimoto et al., 2000; Gray et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2007] . Conversely, identification of adenovirus in a patient specimen by PCR, followed by characterization of the amplimer, allows the identification of the virus at the species or type level more expeditiously.",
