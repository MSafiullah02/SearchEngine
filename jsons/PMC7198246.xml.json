Repositories where work is checked in by a very small group of developers are unsuitable for analysis because the assumption of low cognitive and affective trust is not true. In general, small communities are able to organize much more tightly, which leads to higher levels of cognitive and especially affective trust. This may happen in larger communities too (consider the level of affective trust offered to longstanding community contributors such as Linus Torvalds, for example), but it is much rarer.",
