This approach requires significant interfacial optimization to avoid dewetting behavior that leads to pinhole defects and thus limits the ability to produce ultrathin films. Additionally, it is challenging to achieve conformality (i.e., to have the same film thickness over all the features of a geometrically complex device) via solution\u2010based method.17 Conformal coverage is particularly important for device structures having high\u2010aspect\u2010ratio features, including nanostructured devices such as 3D batteries and ultracapacitors.20, 36 A second issue within the solution\u2010based processing methods is the limited solubility or complete insolubility of some target polymers. Indeed, to enhance the solubility of these polymers, additional synthetic modifications to attach pendant groups to the target structures are commonly practiced, which increase the complexity of device fabrication.20 These are two of the factors have limited the application of solution\u2010based methods in the field of device fabrication.

This substrate independence reduces device fabrication complexity and expands the applicability of the CVD method to novel substrates. The solvent\u2010free nature also assures minimal dewetting and essentially pinhole free CVD polymer films.37 CVD polymer composition and crosslinking can be systematically tuned by introducing co\u2010monomers, which can further optimize device performance and enhance the device durability and stability.

The current polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection method is very accurate;56 however, it is very time\u2010consuming and requires well trained professionals. The researchers developed a new platform called DhITACT\u2010TR based on iCVD and microfluidic technologies as seen in Figure 2f. iCVD was used to synthesize a conformal coating of poly(2,4,6,8\u2010tetramethyl\u20102,4,6,8\u2010tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane) (PV4D4)1, 56 on a pre\u2010fabricated channel. DNA primers end\u2010functionalized with \u2013SH are covalently tethered on the polymer coating via a thiol\u2010ene click reaction. The immobilized DNA primer is further used to hybridize and immobilize different DNA templates for negative control and positive control. The DhITACT\u2010TR system is able to detect the MERS coronavirus within 30 min at a very low pathogen concentration, which is much more efficient compared to the traditional PCR technique. In addition, the sensitivity is enhanced by 100 fold compared to their last generation of detection chips. Furthermore, the platform with iCVD coatings is capable for detection of various infectious diseases.56\n",

The crystal structure of p(PFDA\u2010co\u2010MAA) was further studied by Ranacher et al.58 Various X\u2010ray techniques revealed that p(PFDA\u2010co\u2010MAA) crystallizes in a smetic A bilayer structure. An increase in MAA content increases the interplanar spacing to form water transport channels as seen in Figure\n\n3\na. Further increases in MAA content result in completely amorphous films. Correspondingly, the proton conductivity of p(PFDA\u2010co\u2010MAA) increases with MAA content, peaking at 55 S cm\u20131 for 41% MAA content. For comparison, the proton conductivity of Dupont Nafion is approximately 100 S cm\u20131. Further work by Urstoger et al. sought to reduce swelling of PEMs after extended water exposure.57 PECVD was used to create crosslinked pMAA using hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO). pMAA homopolymer films either swelled or shrunk as much as 26% after two weeks exposure to water. Copolymer films deposited at higher plasma power showed greater stability with only 4% shrinkage after the same water exposure.

Gleason and co\u2010workers first reported the use of pV4D4 doped with lithium ions as a room temperature SPE.36 As deposited 25 nm pV4D4 was shown to be an electrical insulator with electron conductivities \u224810\u201311 S cm\u20131 and withstand electric fields greater than 104 V cm\u20131, all characteristics essential for the role of electrode separator. pV4D4 doped with lithium perchlorate exhibits room temperature ionic conductivities of \u224810\u20138 S cm\u20131, which is similar to solution processed poly(ethylene oxide), the current state of the art. However, the iCVD pV4D4 films have the benefit of being substantially thinner than conventional solution processed films which results in six orders of magnitude lower ionic diffusion time. Rolison and co\u2010workers compared the electropolymerization (EP) and iCVD synthesis of pV3D3, an analogue of pV4D4 with a smaller ring structure.53 In this study, 30\u201350 nm thick pV3D3\u2010synthesized through both routes was deposited on carbon coated silica (C@SiO2) fiber paper. The underlying fiber structure was best retained with the iCVD method, as seen in the SEM cross section in Figure 3c. FTIR analysis of the polymers show that many more vinyl bonds have reacted in the iCVD synthesis compared to the EP synthesis. Correspondingly, the impedance of iCVD pV3D3 is \u224860 \u03a9 greater than EP pV3D3, showing it is a better electrical insulator. The iCVD synthesis and deposition kinetics of cyclic polysilazanes (CPSNs), pV3N3 and pV4N4, were studied by Chen et al. as potential SPEs.82 The poor vinyl bond reactivity of CPSNs results in a much lower degree of crosslinking when compared to their cyclic polysiloxane (CPSO) counterparts, as evidenced by a 10\u201320\u00b0 increase in water contact angle hysteresis over CPSOs. A corresponding study by Reeja\u2010Jayan et al. showed that CPSOs have higher ionic conductivities than CPSNs.80 Moreover, a larger ring structure can lead to an order of magnitude increase in ionic conductivity. Inductively coupled plasma\u2010 mass spectroscopy determined that pV4D4 uptakes more lithium ions during the doping process than pV3D3. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that pV4D4 has a 9.7 kJ mol\u20131 lower activation energy for lithium uptake compared in pV3D3. DFT simulations also determined that lithium ions reside in areas of negative charge around a V4D4 molecule, as shown in Figure 3d. Gleason and co\u2010workers are currently studying the integration of doped pV4D4 films into full battery architectures. Figure 3e shows a previously unpublished TEM micrograph of iCVD pV4D4 conformally coating a lithium manganese nickel oxide (LMNO) particle, a spinel cathode material. A clear transition from LMNO to pV4D4 is evidenced by the abrupt end of crystalline lattice fringes into an amorphous layer.",

This was attributed to the low defect density of the pV3D3 films, which was resulted from iCVD's solvent\u2010free nature eliminated the potential for any solvent residues. iCVD's ability to fabricate ultrathin layers, down to sub\u201010 nm of pinhole\u2010free and uniform thinness, allows high capacitance density of the insulating layers to be achieved. Thus the iCVD pV3D3 films were proposed as high\u2010capacitance gate dielectric for field\u2010effect transistors (FETs). Subsequently in this work, iCVD pV3D3 was grown on a plastic substrate and a variety of channel layers as gate dielectrics to yield flexible FETs (e.g., Figure 4b inset). The devices exhibit ideal, hysteresis\u2010free transfer characteristics and consistently low gate leakage current, as shown in Figure 4b. Following up the pV3D3 homopolymer work, Im and co\u2010workers have further modified the pV3D3 thin film by surface treatment.55 Oxygen plasma treatment were used to form a molecular\u2010thin oxide capping layer, onto which self\u2010assembly monolayers (SAMs) were tethered by applying silane\u2010based reagents. The capping layer enhances the thermal stability of the dielectrics and provides reactive sites for subsequent silanization. The SAM improves the interface between the dielectric and the pentacene channel layer. As a result, the thin\u2010film transistors (TFTs) with SAM\u2010treated pV3D3 gate dielectric, exhibited substantially higher field\u2010effect mobility and on\u2013off ratio. Recently, the library of iCVD dielectrics was extended to three new polymers: pEGDMA, pIBA, and pPFDA.60 All exhibited low leakage currents under the condition of being flexed, and were demonstrated as gate dielectric layers for hysteresis\u2010free, low\u2010voltage TFTs. In addition to being used as gate dielectrics, iCVD pV3D3 has also been explored as an encapsulation layer by itself or in conjunction with other materials, due to its long\u2010term stability as well as aforementioned mechanical flexibility and electrical insulation properties. iCVD pV3D3 was first demonstrated to be suitable for use in electrically insulating neural recording array.84 Its high electrical resistivity allows films as thin as 5 \u00b5m to serve as electrical insulation layer for this application. Moreover, it displayed resistance to hydrolysis at elevated temperature and a variety of solvents. In addition, the electrical properties of pV3D3 films exhibit long\u2010term stability over 2.5 years under simulated implant conditions. Having shown its potential as biopassivation layer, iCVD films were further hybridized with inorganic thin films synthesized via PECVD, ALD, and HWCVD to produce barrier layers to vapor transmission.54, 65, 85, 86 The hybrid films have the advantages of both inorganic and organic films, displaying low vapor transmission and good mechanical flexibility. Coclite et al. synthesized a type of hybrid film by combining PECVD and iCVD in a single\u2010chamber process.65 The same precursor, HVDSO, was used to produce a multilayer stack composed of SiOx\u2010like layer via PECVD and pHVDSO layer via iCVD. The hybridization was achieved by alternating the polymerization mechanisms. Water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) of 0.01 g m\u20132 per day at 28 \u00b0C, 98% RH were obtained, which represents a barrier improvement factor of 100 over the single SiOx\u2010like layer. iCVD pV4D4 has also been hybridized with Al2O3 deposited by ALD for encapsulation of organic electronic devices.85 The WVTR of the hybrid encapsulation layer was as low as 2.17 \u00d7 10\u22124 g m\u20132 per day at 38 \u00b0C, 90% RH. Currently, the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art value of WVTR, 10\u22126 g m\u20132 per day, has been achieved by several methods and materials, such as plasma\u2010enhanced CVD (PECVD)\u2010deposited SiO2,87 PECVD\u2010deposited SiNx/SiOx multilayer with a polymer overcoat,88 atomic layer deposition (ALD)\u2010deposited SnOx,89 hot\u2010wire CVD (HWCVD)\u2010deposited SiNx/polymer hybrid multilayer.90 This state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art value is also the requirement of new\u2010generation organic electronic devices.65 Since iCVD polymers have shown great potential in enhancing the WVTR of the inorganic barriers as aforementioned, even lower WVTR may be potentially achieve in the future. A recent work, interestingly, integrated a layer of pPFDMA onto the outermost of a pV4D4\u2010Al2O3 hybrid layer, adding a self\u2010cleaning functionality to the encapsulation layer.54 At the device level, Im et al. recently demonstrated an organic TFT with iCVD pV3D3 gate dielectric and pV3D3\u2010Al2O3 hybrid bilayer encapsulation, as shown in Figure 4c.91 The device shows a substantially improved source\u2013drain current under 15 V of gate\u2010source voltage as a constant voltage stress in ambient air (Figure 4d).

Direct\u2010printing of electronic features is attractive due to their rapid rate, material flexibility, and lower cost in equipment and operation. Several well\u2010established methods, including screen, gravure (intaglio), flexographic (relief), and inkjet printing have been adapted to pattern electronic materials with high throughput, yet their resolution (minimum feature size) is limited to \u224820 \u00b5m.110 Flexography in principle may achieve printed features matching the stamp geometry, by loading the liquid ink directly on the upraised stamp structures and relief transfer under contact.111, 112 These direct\u2010printing technologies also leverage advances in functional inks including metallic and semiconductor colloidal solutions which are key to applications including thin\u2010film transistors and transparent electrodes for use in large\u2010area displays, touchscreen devices, and solar panels. Although elastomeric stamps can easily be fabricated with micrometer\u2010scale and smaller features, the liquid transfer between two solid surfaces is prone to liquid spreading, which prevents the transfer of uniform, thin layers for feature sizes smaller than 20\u201350 \u00b5m.113 Wettability control of such porous nanostructures is needed to fully utilize the high surface area associated in such structures. The conformality of the CVD polymers offers a unique way of controlling the wettability of porous nanomaterials. One of the widely\u2010 researched porous nanomaterials is CNTs. The CVD synthesis of vertically aligned CNTs (VA\u2010CNTs)114 using lithographically\u2010patterned catalyst films directly creates bulk microstructures with tunable electrical and mechanical properties as well as high porosity (>99%).37, 115, 116 The large surface area of VA\u2010CNTs with combined control of microscale geometry and nanoscale porosity is beneficial for their applications in batteries117 and supercapacitors,118 surface wettability control,119 and liquid ink direct contact printing.114 However, as the spacing between the individual CNTs decreases and the resulting aspect ratio increases, the surface area per unit volume also increases significantly. Thus, the VA\u2010CNTs become increasingly influenced by surface forces, such as capillary forces when exposed to liquids.

Petruczok et al. reported that iCVD achieved the Cr/Au patterns on curved substrates with the combination of iCVD poly(4\u2010vinyl pyridine) and post\u2010soaking the films with a photoactive molecule.124 For this geometry of substrate, the traditional method of applying resist to by spin coating would be challenging. In further work, UV\u2010light\u2010responsive poly(vinyl cinnamate) was iCVD copolymerized with temperature responsive poly(N\u2010isopropyl acrylamide) for reversible patterning.74\n",

            "text": "Yet another strategy is using pre\u2010patterns of an inhibitor or oxidant prior to the deposition.30, 61, 62, 63, 70, 127, 128 The pre\u2010patterns of transition metal (or salts) delayed the film growth selectively in iCVD, while pre\u2010patterns of Fe (III) tosylate Fe(Tos)3 composites, as an oxidant, promoted the deposition in VPP. The Gupta group published a series of papers on selective iCVD with the pre\u2010patterns of transition metal salts such as CuCl2 and Cu(NO3)2.61, 62, 63 They formed the pre\u2010patterns by spin\u2010casting or spay\u2010coating with transition salt solutions before iCVD. They investigated some combinations of several transition metal salts and polymers to evaluate the inhibition effect and observed that metal cations affect the ability to inhibit the polymer deposition.63 This approach enabled the selective deposition of fluoropolymers on porous structures such as papers. They further demonstrated a paper\u2010based microfluidic device with the patterned fluoropolymer barriers. The barriers allowed the containment of organic solvents within the paper\u2010based device so that it can detect water insoluble analytes in the solvents.62 For the inhibition effect of transition metal salts, they examined the changes in the oxidation state of metals during the iCVD process and concluded that the salts quenched the propagating radicals which led a reduction of the oxidation states of the metal.61 In addition to such transition metal composites, it was recently reported that applying the electrical charge to metals can inhibit the growth of PPX films via VPP and enhance the inhibition effect, irrespective of the substituted functionality.70 Wu and co\u2010workers effectively inhibited the deposition of parylene C and aldehyde\u2010functionalized PPX on metal substrates supplying an electrical charge, while the growth inhibition of both films failed with no electrical charge. They explained that supplying electrical energy to the substrate increases the transition of the surface energy, thus reducing the sticking coefficient by one order of magnitude for a substrate: for example, iron.70 Micropatterned self\u2010assembled monolayers (SAMs) on a gold substrate by microcontact printing (\u00b5CP) can also inhibit the growth of functional paracyclophane films.30 Gall et al. demonstrated that the different chain groups of SAMs have different abilities to inhibit the film growth; CH3\u2010terminated SAMs inhibited effectively, while COOH\u2010 and OH\u2010 terminated SAMs did not.30 In contrast, the pre\u2010patterns of oxidants can encourage the selective growth of PEDOT films by VPP. Two techniques contributed to printing the oxidant inks: dip\u2010pen lithography (DPN) and inkjet printing.127, 128 In both techniques patterned oxidant inks with unique compositions were formed on substrates prior to introducing vapors of monomer. The key for successful selective deposition of PEDOT via the techniques is unique oxidant inks compatible to each printing technique. O'Connell et al. mixed Fe(Tos)3 oxidant with an amphiphilic block copolymer to control the water content, which is critical to transfer the oxidant ink to substrates from the tip of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in DPN as well as to stabilize the printed ink on the substrate during the polymerization.127 They successfully shrunk the PEDOT pattern size down to 250 nm in width. For inkjet printing, localized oxidant inks formulated with triblock copolymers deliver good flow characteristics and stability.128 The resulting PEDOT patterns achieved the high conductivity (\u22481000 S cm\u22121) and were successfully built in organic electrochemical transistors as an electrode.",

As a result, the iCVD topcoat created sub\u201010 nm patterns from chemical guide strips of DSA after the thermal anneal. Their spectroscopic studies revealed that iCVD formed the unique interface between the BCP and topcoat, which is a mixed interfaced made by grafting and intermolecular entanglements. This unusual interface is not observed in a spun\u2010cast topcoat.",

            "text": "CVD polymerization is an enabling technology for a wide range of devices including chemical and biological sensors, batteries/supercapacitors, photovoltaics, and novel nanostructured devices. The organic layers generated by CVD technology exhibit benefits such as mechanical flexibility, specific and versatile organic functionality, and low\u2010temperature synthesis. The CVD polymer method also enables novel approaches to patterning and advanced printing. A key merit of the CVD polymer approach is often its ability to achieve conformal coating of CVD polymers on a multitude of different structures. In addition, other merits contribute to their own specific applications as well. This review paper demonstrated the advantages of CVD technology in fabricating devices with the applications shown in Figure 1. In chemical/bio\u2010sensing, the added functional groups provide docking sites for various sensing elements, while the modulation of the Fermi level in the oCVD polymers also provides great sensing signals. In the applications of batteries and supercapacitors, the excellent dielectric property of the iCVD polymers and the conformal coating comprised of CVD conducting polymers enhanced the performance prominently. When fabricating photovoltaic devices, the solvent\u2010free neutral feature of oCVD polymer lead to an efficient hole transporting layer. The insulating transparent and water repelling nature of the iCVD polymers facilitated the application of insulation and encapsulation of various devices. Last, but not least, the polymer synthesized via the iCVD technique provides the enormous opportunity for advance printing and sub\u201010 nm patterning. With all of the applications discussed above, iCVD and oCVD techniques are very versatile and powerful tools in fabricating various devices with insulating or conducting polymers.",
