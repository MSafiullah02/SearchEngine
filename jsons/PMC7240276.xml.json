Previous studies showed that perceived stress is a major obstacle to sleep and eroded sleep quality [6,7]. Specifically, the higher the perceived stress, the worse the sleep quality [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], and the reduction in perceived stress predicted an improvement in sleep quality [7]. Notably, researchers revealed that front-line workers (eg, medical staff) had poor sleep quality during COVID-19 in China [2]; however, a recent study investigated the vicarious traumatization in the general public and front-line medical staff and found the general public displayed more vicarious traumatization than did front-line medical staff during the pandemic [14]. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.",

According to the cognitive theory of emotion, cognitive appraisal is a key factor in determining one\u2019s emotional state [16, 17, 18]. Anxiety may occur when one\u2019s life is appraised as threatening or stressful. Some evidence shows that anxiety levels increase after exposure to stressful events (eg, war, earthquakes, violence, etc. [19, 20, 21]) and higher perceived stress is significantly associated with increased anxiety [22, 23, 24, 25]. In contrast, it is increasingly clear that anxiety is negatively related to sleep quality. For example, higher anxiety is an important predictor of poor sleep quality, more insomnia symptoms, and longer sleep onset time [26,27]. Importantly, higher anxiety predicted lower sleep quality among individuals during the COVID-19 [2]. Thus, we posit that anxiety mediates the influence of perceived stress on sleep quality.",

Individuals with high (vs. low) self-esteem can better respond to threats and frustrations and display stronger subjective well-being, meaning in life, positive emotions, and life satisfaction [31,32,29,33,34]. Importantly, researchers who utilized Terror Management Theory (TMT) believe that high self-esteem is the result of an individual\u2019s adaptation to the environment and serves to buffer against potential anxiety [35,36]. Consistent with TMT theory, a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies showed that higher self-esteem significantly predicted lower anxiety levels [37]. Further, when manipulating self-esteem through personality feedback, researchers found that participants in the high self-esteem condition had lower anxiety levels when facing the stressful stimuli (eg, a video about death) than did participants in the low self-esteem condition [38]. Taken together, self-esteem may moderate the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety; further, it may moderate the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through anxiety.",

For example, higher self-esteem was related to fewer insomnia symptoms in a large community-based sample of adults aged 30 to 84 years [39]. Lemola et al. [39], also found that short (<6 h) and long (>9 h) sleep duration that were harmful to health (eg, increasing mortality hazard [40]) were correlated with low self-esteem. Even when dealing with stressful events (ie, hospitalization), self-esteem was positively correlated with children\u2019s sleep efficiency [41]. Therefore, it is logical to speculate that people with low self-esteem will have lower sleep quality than people with high self-esteem, especially when facing stressful events. That is, the direct effect of perceived stress on sleep may be moderated by self-esteem.",

Further, self-esteem significantly moderated the effect of perceived stress on sleep through anxiety.

            "text": "The number of poor sleepers in the current study was much higher than the proportion reported in previous Chinese studies, which were not related to COVID-19. For example, Zhang et al. [53], surveyed the sleep quality of 27,912 Chinese rural individuals aged 18\u201379 years and found that 21.80% of participants were getting poor sleep [53]. Ning et al. [54], found that 24.10% of 1,469 HIV-infected Chinese adults (aged 18\u201380 years) and 19.90% of 2,938 HIV-uninfected participants had poor sleep quality [54]. Jiang et al. [55], calculated the global PSQI score only based on six subscale scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction), and found that 27.44% of 28,202 Chinese rural participants aged 18\u201379 years were poor sleepers [55]. The current results thus suggest that the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public during COVID-19 was worse than usual. This study was conducted when the pandemic was severe, which may explain the decline in participants\u2019 sleep quality. In line with this notion, previous studies showed that exposure to stressors (eg, hurricanes) leads to lower sleep quality, longer sleep latency, increased awareness during the night, and more sleep complaints [3, 4, 5].However, our results suggested that, during COVID-19, the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public (mean PSQI = 4.88) was better than that of the front-line medical staff (mean PSQI = 8.58; [2]). We cautiously speculate that the countermeasures for COVID-19 may reduce the impact of the pandemic on the sleep quality of the general public. On one hand, to cut-off the transmission of the virus, the general public was encouraged to practice home-isolation and wear masks, which effectively reduced the risk of infection. On the other hand, during the period of home-isolation, the state has implemented many measures to ensure that the daily lives of the general public are as normal as possible; for example, college students can take classes online at home.",

Moreover, perceived stress affected sleep quality through anxiety, indicating that perceived stress increased feelings of anxiety, which, in turn, decreased sleep quality. These results were consistent with Stress and Coping Theory, which proposes that stress occurs when individuals perceive that the demands of environmental stimuli exceed or tax their resources, which results in a changed emotional state (eg, anxiety) that, in turn, affects one\u2019s health [56, 57, 58, 59,18]. Since perceived stress was measured by the degree of unpredictability, uncontrollability, and overload [42]. in the current study, participants with higher stress perceived lower control over their lives. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that lower perceived control is associated with higher anxiety levels and more anxiety symptoms [60, 61, 62, 63, 64]; therefore, our results were consistent with these models of anxiety, which suggests that control over life plays an important role in anxiety development [65]. In addition, we found that higher anxiety levels predicted worse sleep quality. In line with this study, previous studies have consistently found that higher anxiety levels were associated with worse self-reported health, decreased well-being, higher levels of depression, increased disability, and cognitive impairment [66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72].",

            "text": "Our results showed that self-esteem moderated the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety, which, in turn, moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through anxiety. Specifically, the effect of perceived stress on anxiety was stronger in those with low self-esteem vs. high self-esteem. These findings are consistent with TMT theory, which suggests that high self-esteem helps buffer against anxiety [35,36]. Accordingly, faced with the stressors induced by COVID-19, participants with low self-esteem were more likely to experience anxiety than were participants with high self-esteem. Individuals with high self-esteem typically hold more positive beliefs (eg, intelligent, popular, attractive, etc.) about themselves relative to those with low self-esteem [73, 74, 75]. Similarly, compared with individuals with low self-esteem, those with high self-esteem are more confident in their ability and more optimistic about their performance on future tasks, even following a failure [76]. Further, participants with high self-esteem display more self-protection and attribute failure more to external factors than participants with low self-esteem [74,77]. These characteristics of high self-esteem may help reduce anxieties related to threats. In addition, we also found that self-esteem moderated the relationship between perceived stress and sleep quality, indicating that higher perceived stress predicted lower sleep quality in those with low self-esteem, but not in those with high self-esteem. These findings are consistent with previous studies, suggesting that self-esteem is a protective factor for sleep [39,41].",

            "text": "Several limitations deserve mentioning. Previous studies showed that, compared with women, men have shorter sleep quantity and lower sleep quality [78,79]. Results also suggest that sleep problems are more common among women, especially those with depression [78,79]. However, owing to data collection problems, 795 participants did not report their sex, which prevents analyzing any possible sex differences. To control for the potential influence of sex on the current results, we only analyzed the data with sex information (n = 835, 254 men and 581 women). The results indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety (ab = 0.137, Boot SE = 0.02, Boot 95% CI = [0.11, 0.17]) and the moderated mediation analysis of self-esteem (the effect of the interaction between perceived stress and self-esteem on anxiety: B = -0.02, t = -2.00, p < 0.05) were both stable. Second, we did not have data from front-line workers, which prevents directly analyzing the difference in sleep quality between front-line workers and the non-diseased general public. Third, the measure of sleep was based on individuals\u2019 subjective sleep reports. Previous studies showed that subjective sleep reports could underestimate or overestimate sleep quality compared to objective sleep assessments owing to psychological factors, such as mood [80, 81, 82]. Thus, future studies should try to objectively measure sleep (eg, polysomnography or actigraphy). Finally, this study employed a cross-sectional design; thus, we cannot infer causality. Further research should adopt experimental or longitudinal designs to explore the causal implications of this study.",
