            "text": "Based on sequence homology and receptor specificity, interferons (IFNs) are divided into three types, i.e. type I, II and III [1]. The three types of IFNs display distinct expression patterns and have each key role in innate and adaptive immunity. Interestingly, the first identified IFN was chicken interferon, originally defined as a factor that interferes with influenza virus replication in chicken chorioallantoic membrane [2]. However, after its initial discovery, the IFN related research in chicken immunology has been lagging behind, especially in the field of antiviral mechanisms and its application to combat viral disease in chicken. Chicken IFNs (ChIFNs) also include the three types present in mammals. The difference is that the identified type I ChIFNs include both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, whereas type II (IFN-\u03b3) and type III (IFN-\u03bb) ChIFNs exist as a single gene each [3]. In fact, as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, IFNs do not directly kill or inhibit the virus but rather act indirectly as autocrine or paracrine factors to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and transcriptionally induce a large number of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that exert the antiviral effects [1, 4].",

In the canonical pathway for generating ISGs, IFN-induced signaling initially results in the phosphorylation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of proteins, which then phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of proteins (STAT1 and STAT2). Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 (during type I or III IFN stimulation) form a heterodimer that translocates to the nucleus to form the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex consisting of IFN-stimulated genes factor 3 (ISGF3) with IRF-9, thereby inducing hundreds of ISGs after binding the IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs). However, activation by type II IFN only involves the dimerization of phosphorylated STAT1 to form \u03b3-interferon activation factor (GAF) that translocates to the nucleus and binds to gamma-activated sequences (GAS) of response genes [7].",

Both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb play an important role in combating influenza viruses [16\u201318]. Furthermore, IFN-\u03bb is considered more effective than type I IFNs in protecting against influenza virus [16]. Both chicken types I and II IFNs appear to protect fibroblasts from viral infection [19\u201322]. However, chicken type III IFN acts predominantly on epithelial cells [23]. The antiviral effect exerted by IFNs is achieved by inducing the production of ISGs [4]. Therefore, a comprehensive catalog of ISGs in poultry could be useful information for the prevention and control of zoonotic avian influenza viruses.",

Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified in humans, several more ISGs are expected to be still discovered [12].

ChIFN-\u03b1, ChIFN-\u03b3, and ChIFN-\u03bb proteins were added to culture media, respectively, to a final concentration of 1000 UI/mL in DF1 cells. The LMH cells were only treated with ChIFN-\u03bb (1000 UI/mL). DF1 and LMH cells were treated with ChIFN or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (natural control, NC) and incubated for 6 h before being harvested. Total RNA was isolated from these cells for RNA-Seq, using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Samples were collected from two independent experiments.",

However, although type III IFN has recently been found to play an important role in the antiviral innate immune response [16, 44, 45], the search for type III ISGs has not yet been carried out systematically. Even more regrettable, the identification of avian ISGs (type T, II and III) is only in its early stage. In our previous study, we systematically identified ISGs induced by chicken IFN-\u03b1 in chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [25]. Other researchers have systematically studied IFN-\u03b1-induced genes in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts or tissues [24, 38].

            "text": "A forward-looking study previously attempted to compare the expression of genes induced by IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IFN-\u03bb in chickens [46]. Unfortunately, that study only selected two genes, Mx and OAS [46]. In the present study, 205 type I, 299 type II, and 421 type III ISGs were systematically identified in the chicken. Previous studies have suggested that IFN-\u03bb mainly plays a role in epithelial cells [30]. Thus, epithelial cells were deliberately selected in the present study, in addition to the fibroblasts that are commonly used. Unexpectedly, 261 type III ISGs were identified in DF1 cells, whereas 246 type III ISGs were identified in LMH cells. These results suggest that chIFN-\u03bb has the potential to exert antiviral effects in chicken fibroblasts. In another study, we demonstrated that chIFN-\u03bb could restrict the replication of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) in DF1 cells [47]. However, only 80 type III ISGs in DF1 and LMH cells were common. This result suggests that IFN can induce different ISGs in different types of cells. In addition, chicken cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (chCH25H), another chicken ISG, was identified and characterized in our previous research, which showed high expression in PBMCs after 6 h of treatment with ChIFN-\u03b1, and in DF1 cells at 24 h and 48 h post chIFN-\u03b1 treatment [25]. However, in the present study, there was no significant increase in CH25H expression after treatment with ChIFN-\u03b1 for 6 h in DF1 cells. Indeed, even for a particular cell type, some genes were induced by IFN at one time point but not at another time point. The phenomenon of different levels of induction at different time points was also evident in previous studies of ISGs [12]. Therefore, the strategy of identifying chicken ISGs using the present protocol is not exhaustive. In future studies, we aim try to use more cell types, different time points, and different IFN doses to increase the coverage of ISGs.",

We hypothesized that ISREs would be present in the promoters of all type I and III ISGs. Surprisingly, ISREs were identified only in a minority of chicken ISGs. Furthermore, ISREs were also found in the promoters of some type II ISGs. Moreover, GAS elements were present in most ISGs that included type I, II, and III. Previous studies have reported that ISRE and GAS elements are uncommon in promoters of type I ISGs in chicken [38].",

Many of the chicken types I and III ISGs do not contain classical ISREs within their promoters, and details of their transcriptional regulation require further characterization. In fact, the active ISGF3 complex interaction with the core of the ISRE is mediated by IRF9 [48]. However, chickens have no mammalian homologous IRF9 gene. The currently annotated chicken IRF9 is in fact an ortholog of IRF10 [3]. Therefore, does the induction of type I and III ISGs in chickens not require ISRE or IRF9? Does chicken IRF10 play a role in type I and III ISGs production? Canonical and non-canonical pathways that induce the expression of type I and III ISGs in chickens are interesting research directions. Additionally, we found that ChIFN-\u03bb could activate promoters with GAS elements in DF1 and LMH cells. These results suggest that ChIFN-\u03bb has a potentially broader ISG induction profile than chicken types I and II IFN.",

A study found that the antiviral activities of IFNs depended on a set of IFN-sensitive genes (\u201crobust\u201d genes) with canonical IFN response elements (ISRE), whereas these elements were not found in the promoters of ISGs that mediate the anti-proliferative responses of IFNs [49]. This result suggests that when we conduct large-scale antiviral ISGs screening, it may be possible to narrow the screening range according to whether the ISGs promoter contains IFN response elements (ISRE and GAS). Indeed, in our study, we found that some classic antivirus ISGs, such as MX, EIF2AK2 (PKR), RSAD2 (viperin), IFITM3, ZC3HAV1(ZAP) (Additional file 10), contain IFN response elements in their promoters.",
