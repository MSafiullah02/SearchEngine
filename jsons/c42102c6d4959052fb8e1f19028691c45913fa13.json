The public health emergencies resulting from COVID-19 are negatively impacting the mental health of the population and increasing the incidence of psychological crises . Early identification of populations in the first stages of psychological crisis will allow for the efficient implementation of interventional strategies (National Health Commission of China 2020). The clinical characteristics of psychological distress have not been well established across the populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, although a general increased level of mental distress has been reported from both the general public and frontline medical personnel (Kang et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 795, "end": 814, "text": "(Kang et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 815, "end": 832, "text": "Qiu et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Correspondence"}, {"text": "Therefore, we designed a pilot and cross-sectional study to identify the characteristics of psychological distress across populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The app-based, anonymous questionnaire was designed to survey the level of psychological distress, and the study was conducted in the Zhongshan, one of prefecture-level cities in Guangdong province, P. R. China, from February 15 to February 29, 2020. A total of 205 participants responded and completed the questionnaires. The Chinese version 9-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-9) and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale were employed to evaluate the prevalence and severity of psychological distress within patients newly recovery from COVID-19 infection, individuals under quarantine, and the general public. A total score of \u2265 10 for both the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 was defined as depression and anxiety respectively. The severity of psychological distress was classified with the standard thresholds: Minimal or none (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Severe (>15) for both the PHQ-9 and GAD-7.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Correspondence"}, {"text": "An increased prevalence of depression (29.2%) was found predominately in patients who experienced COVID-19 infection (p = 0.016), while the prevalence of anxiety was not statistically different across the three groups (p = 0.154) as shown in Table 1 . Trends for an increased prevalence of depression comorbid with anxiety (p = 0.086) were identified in both patients who experienced COVID-19 infection (21.1%) and the general public (22.4%) compared to those in quarantine.
