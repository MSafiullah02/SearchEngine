            "text": "Increasing amount of data the organizations worldwide have at their disposal lead to the need to structure, organize and present the information obtained from it. That is because, in today's rapid-changing business environment, managers and executives need to be able to gain crucial insights about the ongoing project in as little time as possible. Recently, energy efficiency has become a greater field of research, and companies started concentrating on monitoring energy-related metrics. In addition, many of them have built their own internal tools (dashboards) to do just this. However, one of the major drawbacks of building specialized tools is the lack of adaptability. That is, they are often tailored to only one person (e.g. CEO), or a small group of them (e.g. board of directors, managers). Furthermore, the combination of metrics that is displayed to them does not change over time. This is a problem because most likely there exists a better metric combination that would allow users to get the crucial insights faster. To fill this gap, our ongoing research focuses on making the dashboards adaptable to multiple roles within the organization while optimizing for a certain goal. In some scenarios the dashboard's goal may be to detect defects, in others it may be to generate the most profit. As our primary research interest is to amplify energy efficiency, we have chosen that to be our dashboard's goal. Our previous work suggests that in order to handle compound metrics at scale it is needed to represent the dashboard as a complex system. This paper presents the design and the architecture of our proposed solution synergizing the notions from complexity theory, software architecture and user experience (UX) design.",

At the beginning, it was assumed that only hardware metrics influence energy efficiency levels [1] . Lately, more focus has been given to software (code) and process related metrics [2, 3] . In order to achieve the products' continuous delivery it is necessary in each step of software development process to help the development team to assess energy efficiency levels and suggest ways of potentially improving it. Therefore, our research tries to pinpoint the software, process and projectrelated metrics that have the influence on energy efficiency, and then optimizing these metrics. This paper highlights the steps we took to design, architect and develop a dashboard specifically made for the use case of monitoring energy efficiency and optimizing the set of parameters needed to be displayed to different users.",

Here we talk at length about the aspects like technology choice, design style guide, layout, widgets, charts, security, complex systems and more. As the solution we have developed is still in its infancy, Sect. 5 pinpoints the key ways our research is going to progress with the dashboard being one of the central tools.

            "text": "The field of effective dashboard design has gained traction at the beginning of the new millennium thanks to Stephen Few, among others. His \"Information dashboard design\" [4] is still being referenced by many. He starts by arguing that dashboards in the 1990s had major flaws, and that their root problem was in the inability to effectively communicate. Few also said that dashboards have to hold a balance between clarity and complexity [5] . With recent advances in the field of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design, dashboards started getting significantly more traction [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . This resulted in dashboards being way more able to focus on the communication aspect, thus increasing use cases, leading to their wide-spread adoption [4] . Dashboard are becoming also of strategic importance in lean and agile environments [11, 12] , to spread knowledge across workers [13, 14] , and in distributed development environments [15] [16] [17] .",

For example, by knowing the Number of classes in the source code we can easily calculate other metrics like: Number of Immediate sub-classes of a Class, Response for a Class, Weighted methods per Class as well as the Number of Children metric. It can be followed by better development estimates and more qualified product that can maintain the customers expectations. As it was stated in the paper [25] , developers need a set of valid indicators in assisting the developers for better applications. Thus, the study results showed that Cyclomatic complexity, Number of classes, LOC, number of parameters, nested block depth, number of methods, weighted methods per class and method lines have direct relationship with power consumption of mobile applications.

We took a different approach to addressing energy efficiency concerns. Instead of having a fully deterministic system, one in which each and every metric is manually chosen to be displayed, we opted for a system where an algorithm would decide whether or not to display a certain metric.

As it has not yet been fully investigated which factors (metrics) influence the efficiency the most, one approach would be to try and make all combinations of metrics and record the results.
