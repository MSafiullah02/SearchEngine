The two activities act synergistically to accelerate wound repair [8] . Moreover, the modern pharmacological studies showed that Jinyinhua and its active principles also possess the wide pharmacological actions, such as antiendotoxin, antipyretic, antihyperlipidemic, antithrombotic, anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic activities, and hepatoprotective etc. [1] . In addition, anti-lipase, insecticidal and acaricidal activities were also found in the crude extract of Jinyinhua. In recent years new bioactivities, such as the potent anti-Parkinsonism activity [9] and protecting neuronal cells against glutamate excitotoxicity via antioxidative activity [10] , inhibition of the allergic contact dermatitis [11] , and a possible use for antidiabetes, have been discovered and suggested to be in the compounds isolated from Jinyinhua due to its potent inhibitor action for maltase [12] . Researchers thought most of these effects may be related to the active compositions of volatile oil, chlorogenic acid, and flavones. Chlorogenic acid and luteoloside, officially used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of this herb and its related preparations, were shown to have beneficial effects in the aspects of anti-oxidation and antitumor [1, 13] . Moreover, chlorogenic acid showed the antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic activities, and allergy-preventive properties [1, 14] . Meanwhile, luteolin, another major flavonoid in Jinyinhua, and volatile oil also showed significant anti-inflammatory activity. Luteolin has significant bioactivities in the aspects of antifibrotic and anti-5-lipoxygenase activities [6, 15] . Taken together, most of these activities matched to traditional usage.",

Some examples are: the extracting solution of Jinyinhua (alcohol content 55 %) is added before fermentation, the following process is the same as used to brew wine [17] ; Jinyinhua (45-55 g), Gancao (roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, G. inflate, or G. glabra, 5-10 g), Gouqi (fruits of Lycium chinense or L. barbarum, 25-30 g) and Baizhi (roots of Angelica dahurica, 5-10 g) are soaked in 500 ml wine of alcohol content between 55-60 % for more than 25-50 days, then it can be adjusted into different contents of alcohol according to needs.",

Acute toxicity test showed its LD 50 was more than 15 g/kg body weight on mice orally. According to the classification standard of chemicals acute toxicity, it belongs to non-toxic level. Micronucleus test of bone marrow cells up to 7.5 g/kg in mice orally and Ames test/ mammals microsomal enzyme test showed it was safe without mutagenesis.
