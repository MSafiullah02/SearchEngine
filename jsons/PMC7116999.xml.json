An expected tendency would be to consider those methods which discriminate among sequences more clearly than others, i.e., sequence differences should lead to more pronounced differences in their descriptors. In order to address this issue, we had earlier carried out a comparative analysis of several different methods [10] and showed that results of some of the methods correlate strongly with results of other methods, implying that the sequence descriptors arising from the various approaches essentially map the same features; those that do not exhibit high level of correlation could be considered as mapping some attributes unique to those schemes. In this brief commentary, we work out the descriptors for two families of sequences \u2013 the globin genes of Homo sapiens and the envelope genes of flaviviruses \u2013 to determine precisely how much discrimination is evidenced in a selected group of methods.",

As can be seen, the two oldest of the current crop of graphical representations, viz., Nandy plot and Randic-3D plot, show the best clear discriminatory power. For example, in case of the flaviviral envelope genes, the Nandy plot descriptor ranges from 72.61 for DENV2 to 8.91 for WNV and as low as 4.51 for ZIKV; the Randic 3D plot shows descriptors ranging from 221.99 for DENV2 to 113.57 for WNV and 156.22 for ZIKV. The observation that there is a wide difference between DENV2 and, WNV and ZIKV which reflects the base distributions in their genetic composition was first mooted in a previously published paper in detail [9]. On the other hand, the same three sequences yield descriptor values, respectively, of 1485.51, 1503.43, 1495.21 in the Song-Tang representation and 1487.07, 1505.02, 1496.75 in the Randic 2D representation, showing very little distinction between DENV2, WNV and ZIKV. This is reflected in the standard deviation (SD) as a percentage of the average descriptor values (SD%) for each method; while the Nandy and Randic 3D plot descriptors yield SD% 133.51 and 29.60, respectively, for the envelope genes; in case of the Song-Tang and Randic 2D methods, the SD% are 1.03 and 1.27, respectively. Higher SD% implies greater differences in the sequence descriptor values showing increased discriminatory power among related sequences. This is also borne out by the analysis of the human globin genes (Table 3.1) where, again, the Nandy and Randic 3D plots show the best discriminatory power among the seven methods tested. Our analysis, therefore, indicates that it would be advisable to consider methods like the Nandy plot, Randic 3D plot and others of the same ilk, not analysed in this brief commentary, that have the ability to distinguish among sequence differences for analysis of DNA/RNA sequences of a family of closely similar genes.",

The non-similar sequence descriptors would tend to provide distinct separate groups where similar sequences, such as the family of flavivirus genes for instance, having almost identical descriptor values in these methods would cluster together, thus providing an easy way of discriminating between divergent sequences. In this context, it is relevant to recall that in the chemical domain it has long been known that no single topological index can discriminate graphs uniquely [19]. Perhaps, it may be worthwhile to introduce a concept of some \u201csuper-descriptor\u201d on the lines of topological \u201csuper-index\u201d first proposed by Bonchev, Mekenyan and Trinajstic [20] or extracted principal components (PCs) derived from the collection of individual sequence descriptors [21] as some combination of descriptors from various methods for discriminatory power of inter-gene and intra-gene sequences.",

Multiple methods are available to compute this. A comparative analysis of seven such methods - Yau method, Wang-Zhang method, Song-Tang method, Randic 3D method, Randic 2D method, Nandy method and Ji-Li method \u2013 in this brief commentary have elucidated that not all of them have the full capacity to discriminate between closely related sequences. In a retrospective study of flaviviral envelope gene and human globin genes, where one element of each sample set is known to be characteristically different from the rest, the Nandy and Randic 3D methods have yielded results that allow good discrimination between the sequences, whereas the other methods were unable to reflect similar outcome. However, on a broader scale, for classification of a set of close and distant sequences, the remaining five graphical representation methods are able to discern diverging sequences. We suggest that a kind of \u201csuper-descriptor\u201d, which is a blend of elementary descriptors, could be considered to distinguish sufficiently between inter- and intra-gene sequences.",
