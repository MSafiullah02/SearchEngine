This holds true especially for incidents in which symptoms of the affected persons are diffuse, the conditions are undiagnosed, or the hazardous materials involved are not clearly identifi ed. Many incidents caused by material other than biological con-taminants are often initially classifi ed as suspected infectious incidents but, when the full picture becomes clear, they are found to have other causes for example, intoxication by chemical or radiological agents. One reason for this is that most societies have surveillance systems that most of the time direct their major interest toward the more common entity: infectious diseases.",

The primary incident can lead to disruption of the infrastructure in the affected society; which secondary can result in increasing biological incidents through, for example, increased crowding; collapse of water, deteriorating sanitation and hygienic conditions; drought or famine. Secondary effects can even be seen within medical institutions for example as a consequnce of a lessened capacity to isolate infected individuals.",

Because most pathogens and conditions are unknown in the individual contact situation, some basic rules are important to know and to practice from a general point of view. Steps to be taken to achieve adequate personal protection depend on the outcome of the risk assessment conducted for each specifi c situation. The appearance of an infectious agent or disease at a certain place or at a certain time can be part of the natural occurrence of the microorganism concerned, but it also can be a consequence of environmental contamination, either accidental or intentional. Each individual has physiological barriers such as skin and mucous membranes that function fairly well, at least as long as the barriers are intact. The barrier effect can be much improved and risks of exposure limited by introducing hygienic routines that are practiced at each level of contact between staff and potentially affected persons, i.e., every patient in a treatment or nursing situation. Basic hygienic routines include disinfection of hands with alcohol-based items before and after each physical contact; the use of disposable gloves when in contact with secretions or for investigations; and the use of disposable aprons and eye and mouth protection when there is a risk of fl uid splash.",

As a result, Gruinard Island was quarantined for many years afterwards. Visits to the island were strictly prohibited, except by personnel checking the level of contamination. In 1986, a decontamination effort was started using several hundred tons of formaldehyde solution diluted in seawater and sprayed all over the island together with removal of the worst contaminated topsoil around the dispersal site.
