            "text": "The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) represents a quantum leap in the fields of molecular and cellular biology [1, 2]. RNAi technologies are powerful tools that are widely used to investigate the biological function of specific proteins either in vitro or in vivo. In particular, RNAi has successfully been used in virology to study the role of specific host proteins in the life cycle and replication of viruses. The introduction into cells of small interfering RNAs (siRNA), 20\u201325 nucleotide short double-stranded RNAs that are specific to target mRNA sequences and allow for sequence-specific degradation of the mRNA, is a relatively fast, simple and robust method to specifically downregulate protein expression and study their function [3]. In our studies, siRNA has proven very useful to validate the functional relevance of cellular proteins that were identified by yeast two-hybrid screens as binding partners of influenza and coronavirus structural proteins [4, 5]. We describe herein a method to efficiently knock down protein expression of a cellular actin binding protein, ezrin, and measure the knockdown efficiency. This method was successfully used to investigate the role of ezrin during host cell entry and infection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5]. While the method described here is specific to the downregulation of ezrin expression, it can easily be modified and adapted to study the function of other cellular proteins during viral infection. The methodology described also forms the basis for larger scale experiments such as siRNA library screenings (see\nNote\n1), which we have successfully established to study host cell factors involved in viral assembly and release [6].",

            "text": "\nThe method described here focuses on knocking down expression of a single cellular gene, ezrin, to uncover its functional role in SARS-CoV infection. This methodology forms the basis for larger-scale functional analyses as it can easily be scaled up to perform siRNA-based functional screen studies to identify host genes involved in the replicative cycle of viruses. Such siRNA-based screening approach has been successfully developed in our lab using a siRNA library screen of 122 cellular genes involved in membrane trafficking to reveal host factors that are functionally implicated in dengue virus assembly and release [6].siRNAs should be handled with special care. RNA molecules are prone to degradation by RNases. Gloves and RNAse-free pipette tips should be used. Tubes containing siRNAs should be kept on ice as much as possible. Store siRNAs at \u221220 \u00b0C and aliquot stock solutions to avoid multiple freeze\u2013thaw cycles.The ezrin siRNAs used here are in the form of an equimolar mix of four siRNA duplexes. This allows for robust knockdown of expression because it increases the odds of binding to target mRNA sequence and silencing to ensue. It is important to note however that individual siRNAs can also be used to silence specific mRNA expression. This alternative approach has the advantage to minimize potential off-target effects of pooled siRNA mixes. We have validated the use of individual siRNA treatment for ezrin silencing, and successfully used an individual siRNA duplex to silence annexin A6 to investigate its functional role in influenza virus infection [4]. Another consideration when performing siRNA studies is the potential for functional redundancies found in families of closely related proteins. In another dengue virus study from our lab, we have found that, while individually silencing the closely related small GTPases Arf4 or Arf5 had minimal effect on dengue virus secretion from cells, combined silencing of these two GTPases allowed for marked decrease in secretion [7].siRNAs are used at a final concentration of 100 nM for transfection of cells. This concentration was determined to be the best compromise between siRNA knockdown efficiency and cell viability by prior optimization experiments that tested increasing concentrations of siRNAs. As optimal siRNA concentration varies depending on cell type used and target gene, we recommend performing such optimization during the setting up of any siRNA assay.The choice of cell lines for conducting siRNA transfections is an important step during the setup and optimization of the assay. HeLa-F5 cells were chosen in our experiments because they robustly express ACE-2, the SARS-CoV receptor, and have been shown previously to be susceptible to SARS-CoV S-mediated viral entry. Furthermore, we have conducted preliminary siRNA transfection on a panel of cell lines, which included HeLa-F5, and found that those cells could be efficiently transfected, with ezrin protein expression levels significantly reduced after siRNA treatment.In the experiment described herein, siRNA transfections and subsequent assays were performed in 96-well cell culture-treated plates. Depending on the experiment planned using the siRNA-treated cells, the format can be adapted to larger culture plates. In that case, the number of cells and volumes of reagents used will have to be proportionally scaled up.Avoiding addition of penicillin/streptomycin to the transfection medium (DMEM-T) is important because lipid-based transfection reagents, such as DharmaFECT 1 increases the permeability of the cell plasma membrane. If present in the transfection medium, there is a greater risk for cellular uptake of the antibiotics with potentially higher cytotoxicity and lower transfection efficiency.Tween 20 is a viscous solution. To ensure that the correct volume of Tween 20 is added to the TBS buffer, cut a 1,000 \u03bcL pipette tip, gently aspirate Tween 20 and add to TBS buffer. Pipette up\u2013down gently and eject tip in buffer. Add stir bar and let solution stir with pipette tip for ~30 min, or until Tween 20 has completely dissolved.The siRNA transfection procedure involves many steps of aspiration of supernatants and addition of solutions on cells. To avoid detaching cells, care should be taken to avoid letting the cells be without medium for more than a few minutes. Also, when adding new medium, solutions should not be pipetted directly on cells, but on the walls of the wells. Media should be pre-warmed at 37 \u00b0C as much as possible, as cold solutions can easily detach cells. We performed routine cell viability assays to determine the cytotoxic effects of siRNA treatments, using Trypan blue exclusion assay after treatments.The repeat of the siRNA transfection step 48 h after the first one depends on several parameters including the efficiency of knockdown after 48 h, the turnover of the targeted mRNA, or the half-life of the protein product. We have observed through a series of tests that the optimal conditions for the knockdown of ezrin was to perform two successive siRNA transfections, 48 h apart.If antibodies for the protein of interest are unavailable, an alternative would be to perform a quantitative RT-PCR assay, using specific primers, to measure levels of corresponding messenger RNAs.After HeLa-F5 cells have undergone two successive siRNA transfections, the siRNA efficiency control plate is used to assess the quality of knockdown. Analysis of ezrin or GAPDH (housekeeping protein) protein content from one well of a 96 well plate is sufficient for detection by Western blot.An alternative to the pre-cast Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) system is the use of gels prepared in the laboratory using gel casters. This allows customizing gels to the most appropriate percentage of polyacrylamide for the protein to be analyzed. 8\u201312 % polyacrylamide separating gel (8, 10 or 12 % Acrylamide\u2013Bis-Acrylamide, 400 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.8, 0.1 % SDS, 0.04 % ammonium persulfate (APS), 0.07 % tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) added last, ddH2O) and 4 % polyacrylamide stacking gel (4 % Acrylamide\u2013Bis-Acrylamide, 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 6.8, 0.1 % SDS, 0.06 % APS, 0.1 % TEMED added last, ddH2O) are commonly used. Laboratory-made running, loading, and transfer buffers can also be prepared in the laboratory following standard Western blotting procedures.\n",
