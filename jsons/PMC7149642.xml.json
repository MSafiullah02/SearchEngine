In these, reovirus 3 infection occurred in 28 (82%) and murine hepatitis in 25 (74%). Although there was at that time no routine serologic test for epidemic diarrhea of infant mice, it is common knowledge that virtually every colony of conventional mice suffered that infection to a greater or lesser extent.",

Thus, the economic impact on commercial mouse colonies can be severe. Furthermore, newborn mice, pooled from many dams and then redistributed to them at random, are used for the isolation and identification of certain viruses in diagnostic and epidemiological studies, for example arboviruses (Shope, 1980), coronaviruses (Mcintosh et al., 1967), and reoviruses (Stanley, 1977). Clearly, indigenous infection with related or identical agents in only a few such infants could confound and compromise the validity of observations following the inoculation of test materials. It should be pointed out, too, that Collins and Parker (1972) demonstrated both reovirus 3 and murine hepatitis virus as contaminants in some murine leukemia and transplantable tumor specimens.",

It should be pointed out that both EDIM and mouse hepatitis virus (LIVIM) were present simultaneously in that colony. Although the filter devices did not eliminate the disease(s), they probably reduced the pathogenic microbial load in the immediate environment of the susceptible animals, but the precise mechanism by which this control method succeeds to the extent that it does is obscure.",

They found that dry bulb temperature differentials, comparing environments inside and outside the cage, were not significantly different (about 2\u00b0C) between filtered and unfiltered cages, but that dew point differentials were significantly greater in the filtered cages (about 5\u00b0C) than in unfiltered cages (about 3\u00b0C).

The same picture was encountered in both instances, except that the lesions were less intense following small doses. The liver showed minimal change at 4 days. Beneath the capsule and near the centrilobular veins were aggregates of mononuclear cells and a few segmented neutrophils. Eosinophilic degeneration of hepatocytes could be seen at this time. Throughout the next few days, the foci of hepatocyte necrosis underwent cystic change due to lysis of the eosinophilic material. Dense eosinophilic structures, similar to Councilman bodies, could be seen lying free or within macrophages. Foci of proliferating mesenchymal cells occurred in all lobular zones. They varied from small ones, the result of recent necrosis, to very large regions that coalesced with other similar foci. At the same time, about the seventh day after infection, hepatocytes enlarged to three to four times the normal size. The nuclei were not affected, although they seemed slightly less basophilic than usual. Hyperplasia of Kupffer cells and sinusoidal collections of macrophages, lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and debris were evident. By the fourteenth day, many necrotic cells had lysed, and organization of cells peripheral to the necrotic foci began. Nevertheless, new necrotic regions were still developing.",

In the biliary tract, Papadimitriou (1968) determined that virus invades many of the lining cells of the common bile duct, which eventually die. Bile canaliculi are dilated and their microvilli swollen. The common bile duct is dilated, and the ampullary region becomes obstructed with debris. It is this obstruction that leads to both hepatic and pancreatic dysfunction, for after studying the pancreatic lesions further, Papadimitriou and Walters (1967) concluded that, even though virions were seen in pancreatic acinar cells, the principal cause of acinar degeneration is ductal obstruction.",

By means of recombinant viral clones of types 1, 2, and 3, they showed that the S1 gene determined serotype specificity, whereas from adaptive transfer experiments, it was clear that certain structures of the major histocompatibility complex were needed for transfer of reactivity. Route of inoculation and viral infectivity (intact as opposed to uv-irradiated virus) determined the ability of mice to produce immunocompetent T cells that mediated the DTH reaction. DTH was not conferred by UV-irradiated virus. This tolerance was due to active suppression by means of generation of suppressor T cells.

(1976) and Hierholzer et al. (1979); and NuU, NuA, Nu66, from nude mice with hepatitis and wasting syndrome (Hirano et al., 1975). Other isolates have also been derived from nude mice (Sebesteny and Hill, 1974; Ward et al., 1977), and Fox et al. (1977) have described a strain that appeared during passage of an ascites myeloma cell line in BALB/c mice.",

Signs of the acute disease are distinct but not pathognomonic: ruffled hair, depression or lassitude, inanition, dehydration, weight loss, huddling with cagemates, muscle tremors, deeply colored urine, and reluctance to move when prodded. These signs are seen in various combinations. In older animals, ascites and wasting tend to occur. In infections with neurotropic variants, such as JHM, the principal sign in weanlings and adults is a flaccid paralysis of the hindlimbs that may be preceded by ruffled hair and depression. Conjunctivitis may occur. Convulsions and hyper-irritability are infrequent, as are tremors. The righting ability may be compromised, and circling is occasionally seen.",

The hyaline material is intensely eosinophilic and has been compared to Councilman bodies in human hepatitis (Svoboda et al., 1962) (Fig. 5\n). Early in the course of infection, basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions may be seen. Hepatocyte nuclei degenerate after the cytoplasm. In the center of the necrotic focus, hepatocytes have disappeared, leaving only collapsed reticulum and fat-laden phagocytes. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes appear early but then die and are phagocytosed along with the necrotic debris. Multinucleated giant cells are seen, and in animals surviving for some time, necrotic cells may become calcified. Aside from the focal lesions, the remaining liver parenchyma appears unaffected.",

Vacuolar and hydropic changes are prominent in the degenerating cells, and postinfection recurrence of the demyelination develops subsequent to the acute disease. The question of recurrent demyelination has been addressed by Herndon et al. (1975), who found evidence of renewed demyelination in mice 16 months after infection, at a time when the acute lesions had resolved into small foci of fibrillary gliosis with an increased size and number of astrocytic processes. The importance of this finding for investigations into the cause of multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases in man is obvious and has been addressed by, among others, Lucas et al.

(1975b) examined both humoral and cell-mediated immunity and the effect of immunosuppression by antilymphocyte serum. Levy-LeBlond and Dupuy (1977) extended these studies to conclude that at least two types of mature cells are required for transfer of MHV resistance to newborn mice of the A/J (resistant) strain: T lymphocytes and an adherent spleen cell population. Transfer of isologous cells consisting of purified lymphocytes and adherent spleen cells did not, however, confer resistance on newborn mice (A/J strain) (Tardieu et al., 1980). Addition of nonadherent spleen cells (or bone marrow or peritoneal exudate cells) to T lymphocytes and adherent spleen cells resulted in 88% protection. Clearly, cell-mediated immune functions play a significant role in resistance of mice to MHV3 infection.",
