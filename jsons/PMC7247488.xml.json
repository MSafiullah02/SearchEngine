This virus involves serious respiratory tract infections [2, 3]. Detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, this virus might be transferred to the seafood market [4, 5] and then internationally via domestic/commercial air traveler carriers [6]. After that, an emergency has been declared in infected areas of the world and a serious public health concern has been paid at a global level. While to stop the impact of this infection and to avoid further spreading some mathematical estimations are also being performed at each level [7].",

            "text": "Recently, mathematical modeling of the COVID-19 disease has been investigated by several mathematical and computational researchers for the prediction of the disease dynamics. One of the well-known concepts in epidemiology is the basic reproduction number (or it sometimes is called the basic reproductive ratio). This ratio is a quantity and it is denoted by R0. This is the average number of secondary infections produced by a single primary infection in a population where everyone is susceptible. Based on the developed approaches of mathematical epidemiology models, this quantity becomes an essential tool to understand epidemiological concepts and identify key critical parameters for such models. The value of this quantity has been changed for the confirmed cases of Coronavirus. According to a study published recently, the median value of R0 was about 2.28 during the early stage experienced [9]. Based on another study, this quantity is about 2.489. They suggested a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease [10]. There is also a developed compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, the epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures [11]. According to this study, the estimation of the basic reproduction number is very high and it was about 6.47. The idea of the next-generation matrix approach was used to calculate the basic reproduction number for the COVID-19 models, this is presented in [12]. According to their study, this ratio is bout 3.58. Furthermore, an updated model was proposed to estimate the transmission risk of the novel coronavirus, their calculations relate to a time-dependent dynamic model of contact and diagnosis rate. This helps us to re-estimated the daily reproduction number [13].",

The serial interval is a time interval between primary patients (infecters) and the second patient (infectees). This parameter helps investigators to find epidemic transmission links between confirmed cases and uses for design healthcare program strategies [14]. The serial interval is widely used for describing models dynamics of infectious disease. This may help us to understand the effect of contact among individuals and how transmits the virus more quickly. Recently, the serial interval has been calculated for the COVID-19, this estimates by 4.6 days [15]. A reported study mentioned that the mean serial interval for COVID-19 was calculated as 3.96 days. This considerably shorter than the mean serial interval calculated for SARS 8.4 days and MERS 14.6 days [16].",

An issue that has not been explained very well for this new virus is identifying the local sensitivities for non-normalizations, half normalizations, and full normalization techniques in commotional simulations. Here, we are proposing a mathematical model to estimate the transmissibility with the dynamical view of the virus transmission. For the complex model of COVID-19 given in this paper, it is vital to pay more attention to identify critical model elements based on sensitivity analysis and computational results more widely and accurately. Another contribution of this paper is analyzing the suggested model based on different values of the model parameters in commotional simulations. This is also an important step forward to understand how changing the model dynamics and predicting the spread of this virus in the future. The main contribution here is to understand the impact of each model parameter on the model states, this is given in our computational simulations and calculating the local sensitivities. This will help to quantify possible disease control strategies with further improvements and recommendations. Results in this study provide effective roles in further suggestions and preventions theoretically and practically. On possible theoretical suggestion is that these results could help biologists to understand the model dynamics and parameter transmissions. This may give further improvements and analyze the complex models in computational simulations. While the results here could also give practical suggestions. One practical improvement for controlling this disease could be reducing the contact between asymptomatic infected, reported, and unreported infected classes because their transmission parameters are very sensitive based on our computational simulations.",

In other words, for an epidemic network model, nodes are individuals, and edges are contacted among individuals. This representation helps us to understand infectious disease models in terms of a graphical network. There are some recently proposed models for presenting the dynamical equations of COVID-19 [26, [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]]. The model initial populations and interaction parameters are mainly obtained for the confirmed cases in China. The main idea of the models is based on clinical progression, epidemiological individuals, and intervention measures. In this paper, we develop the previous model presented in [55]. We then extend the suggested model structure by including the recovered individuals (R), the unreported symptomatic death rate (\u03b1\n1\nU) and reported symptomatic death rate (\u03b1\n2\nW). The model network diagram and the interaction individual components demonstrated in Figure 1\n.

It can be strongly suggested that anyone in the quarantine places should be separated from the others and should use only their separate equipment, bedroom, and toilet to prevent the transmission of the virus through the touching of shared surfaces. Another suggestion is that reducing the contact between asymptomatic-symptomatic groups and susceptible groups, this is effectively minimizing the number of infected people.
