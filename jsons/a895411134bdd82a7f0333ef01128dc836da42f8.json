A wide variety of transporter proteins are expressed in apical and basolateral membranes and collectively play complex interactive roles in controlling the entire organism's overall metabolism of amino acids. Regulation of the transport systems can be manifested at many levels, including gene splicing and promoter regulation, interactions between requisite subunits of oligomers, thermodynamic electrochemical gradients contributed by ion exchangers, overlap of substrate specificity, selective tissue distribution, and specific spatial distribution of transporters leading to net vectorial flow of the amino acids. The next frontier for workers in this field is to uncover a comprehensive molecular understanding of the manner by which epithelial cells signal gene expression of transporters as triggered by substrates, hormones or other triggers, in order to further understand the trafficking and interactions among multimeric transport system proteins, to extend discoveries of novel small drug substrates for oral and ocular delivery, and to examine gene therapy or nanotherapy of diseases using small molecules delivered via amino acid transporters.",

In this dendogram, the human gene SLC number is listed above the common name for each polypeptide expression product.

In contrast, however, in the kidney and lung these substrates are served by the proton-activated \"PAT/iminoacid\" [66] system which exhibits the activity profiles of two expressed transporter proteins PAT1 and PAT2, as encoded by the SLC36 family genes SLC36A1 and SLC36A2 (see Table 1 ). The latter genes reside on chromosome 5q33.1 in humans or 11B1.3 in mice, as shown in Fig. 2 . The human and mouse open reading frames are each encoded by ten exons.

For example, CD98/4F2hc at the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelium contains a PDZ class II-binding domain [17] regulating integrin signaling, serving in such diverse roles as inflammation modulation, cell growth via mTOR [4, 18] , cell adhesion, migration, and binding rotavirus enterotoxin [19] . 4F2hc (CD98) forms a heterodimer with amino acid transporter subunits in basolateral membranes -asc, LAT1, LAT-2, y + LAT1, y + LAT-2, and xCT -thereby resulting in six different functional transport systems ( Table 2 ). Burdo et al. [20] reported evidence for xCT and 4F2hc in apical membranes of mouse and primate duodenum and renal tubules, as well as in choroid plexus although the particular membrane aspect was not specified for this brain tissue. In situ heterodimerization of y + LAT1 with 4F2hc has been visualized using acceptor photobleaching FRET microscopy [21] . Figure 3 shows the diverse ways by which the 4F2hc subunit plays a role in modulating amino acid transport at the basolateral membrane.",

Proton-dependent secondary active transporters PEPT1 (SLC15A1) and PEPT2 (SLC15A2) are expressed in epithelia of small intestine, renal tubules, liver, and gallbladder. These transporters serve natural dipeptides, and are increasingly exploited for their ability to absorb certain oral pharmaceuticals as substrates [10] . Some examples of substrates accommodated by PEPT1 are shown in Table 3 . Brandsch and colleagues [10] have extensively described peptidomimetic pharmaceutical substrates of PEPT1 and PEPT1. It has become increasingly apparent that natural biological systems, PEPT1 and PEPT2 play roles other than simply nitrogen absorption for the host organism. For example, although PEPT1 is not normally expressed in colon, its expression is induced at the transcriptional level in pathological inflamed states of colonic epithelial cells in inflammatory bowel disorders such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn s disease [28] . In this condition, bacterial metabolite dipeptides provide PEPT1 substrates absorbed intact into colonic cells and subsequently into the colonic lamina propria where immune cells reside [28] . Escherichia coli pathogenic peptide metabolites include Ac-muramyl-Ala-Glu and N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine. This triggers an inflammatory response by induction of MHC I molecules and AP1 and NF\u03baB-related pathways leading to cytokines and macrophage infiltration. In the inflamed state, the sustained luminal acidic state further drives colonic transepithelial transport of the bacterial peptides. The distribution of PEPT1 in various regions along the gut is shown in Fig. 4 .",

Luminal pancreatic peptidases (1) generate products of free amino acids, small di-and tri-peptide fragments, and residual large polypeptides. Enterocyte apical membranebound aminopeptidases (2) further hydrolyze large peptides to yield di-and tri-peptides. A variety of amino acid transport systems (3) move free amino acids across the apical membrane into the enterocyte cytosol. Certain di-and tri-peptides are absorbed intact into the cytosol via apical membrane transporters (4). Subsequently, cytosolic aminopeptidases (5) hydrolyze these peptides to generate free amino acids. The pool of free amino acids is then transported (6) across the basolateral membrane to the serosal side of the epithelium, and subsequently into the portal blood. In the interdigestive postprandial state, amino acids are taken up by the basolateral membrane from the blood. A variety of transporters are responsible for steps 3, 4, and 6, as detailed throughout the text and tables. Analogous events occur in the kidney lumen relating to degradation of peptide hormones, rescue of amino acids, and whole body nitrogen regulation Membrane ion exchangers, primarily H + /Na + electroneutral exchanger NHE3 and Na + /K + ATPase, interject their important roles in modulating the activity of secondary active transporters of amino acids. Figure 7 demonstrates the coordination of selected transporter proteins and their functional transport systems in epithelial metabolism and movement of amino acids concerning the cytosol, and apical and basolateral membranes. In Fig. 7 note the coordination of TAT1 with LAT2/4F2hc which allows efflux of small neutral amino acids at the expense of cycling of aromatic amino acids [31] . Also note the roles of the many transporter subunits involved in coupling and regulating movements of cationic and neutral amino acids. Table 4 Fig. 6 Schematic examples of ion-dependent coupling in amino acid transport at the apical membrane of an epithelium. Left cell shows a generic proton-dependent amino acid uptake coupled with Na + /H + exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3). The center cell shows a generic transporter coupling amino acid influx with Na + influx, activated by the Na + electrochemical potential across the apical membrane. The right cell shows active transport of anionic amino acids (e.g., glutamate or aspartate) via EAAT3 (SLC1A1) coupling to electrochemical gradients of Na + , H + , and K + . In all cases, transepithelial and epithelial cell membrane ion gradients and electrical potentials ( ) ultimately depend on the basolateral membrane Na + /K + -ATPase activity describes the manner by which the selectivities of all the cationic/dibasic amino acid transport systems are determined experimentally.",

A metabolic interplay exists between creatine absorption, arginine and leucine absorption, and gross control of epithelial absorption of other nutrients in these tissues [32] [33] [34] [35] . A putative model of creatine (Cr + ) absorption in renal or intestinal absorptive epithelium is shown in Fig. 8 . Na + and Cl \u2212 -dependent creatine transport occurs across apical membranes and possibly basolateral membranes. In addition to transepithelial absorption, creatine enhances transepithelial absorption of other nutrients (glucose, other amino acids, etc) via villus contraction and pedundular motility through the actions of enterocyte actin-myosin as the result of entyerocyte creatine kinase phosphorylation. Intracelluar trafficking of SLC6A8 proteins sequested in cytosolic endosomal vesicles is intiated by mammalian targeting of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway [36] . The branched chain amino acid L-leucine or its keto analogue \u03b1-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), or L-arginine, can initiate mTOR-dependent SLC6A8 trafficking.",

Stevens then renamed NBB as B 0 in order to be consistent with the pattern of competitive inhibition observed for Van Winkle's \"b\" and \"B\" series of systems in blastocyte membranes [39] . However, H. Christensen interjected (personal communications), requesting that the \" 0 \" superscript be dropped, with the argument that it was redundant in naming a sodium-dependent transport system which served only zwitterion substrates. Thus, the designation \"B\" appeared briefly in the literature [40] . The mRNA was subsequently cloned as SLC6A19 by Kekuda and colleagues [41] [42] [43] , and the literature now alternatively refers to the functional properties of expressed SLC6A19 as either B 0 or B 0 AT1 (sodium-dependent cloned B 0 Amino acid Transporter number 1). B 0 AT1 is expressed prominently in apical membranes of renal proximal tubule and small intestine, as well as other nutrient absorptive epithelia (Table 3) . Actually, B 0 AT1 is expressed all along the gastrointestinal tract intestine [44] , with dominance in jejunum and ileum (Fig. 9) .",

However, ACE2, which is a carboxypeptidase, was subsequently discovered in apical membranes in kidney [52] and intestine [53] [54] [55] . ACE2 fortuitously is recognized as a binding receptor by a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [56] (SARS-CoV), consistent with clinical observations that SARS-CoV causes severe gastrointestinal complications. A presumed intended biological function of ACE2 is proper trafficking and functioning of B 0 AT1, and then membrane removal of the C-terminal single neutral amino acid from nutrient peptides. These particular amino acid products of ACE2 hydrolysis are the very amino acids that are B 0 AT1 substrates [45] . A homologue of ACE2 found in kidney, collectrin, was shown to be a mediator of neutral amino acid transport activity and regulator of blood pressure [45, [57] [58] [59] via the transport interplay of arginine and neutral amino acids through cooperation of B 0 AT1 and the b 0,+ AT/rBAT transporters, as shown in Fig. 7 . Collectrin knock out mice demonstrated reduced expression of apical membrane B 0 AT1, rBAT, and b 0,+ AT, as well as impaired intracellular trafficking of EAAC1, with the residual activity of B 0 AT1 attributable to ACE2. Broer's laboratory demonstrated that the R240 moiety of B 0 AT1 interacts with intestinal ACE2 permitting proper apical membrane trafficking and expression of this sodium-dependent amino acid transporter [45] .",

Dysfunctional SLC6A19 mutants of B 0 AT1 expressed in renal proximal tubule, arising from a variable number of tandem repeat minisatellite polymorphisms, are likely to be a risk factor for hypertension [64] . Figure 11 shows genomic intron/exon relationships concerning known SLC6A19 mutations, and a particular minisatellite repeat unit in intron 9 of SLC6A19 encodes a dysfunctional B 0 AT1 associated with essential hypertension in humans [64] . Interestingly, SLC6A18 encoding another \"orphan\" transporter, XTRP2, which serves glycine reabsorption in kidney, is adjacent to the SLC6A19 gene sequence, although SLC6A18 minisatellites are not involved in hypertension [65] .",

A wide variety of transporter proteins are expressed in apical and basolateral membranes and collectively play complex interactive roles in controlling the entire organism's overall metabolism of amino acids. Regulation of the transport systems can be manifested at many levels, including gene splicing and promoter regulation, interactions between requisite subunits of oligomers, thermodynamic electrochemical gradients contributed by ion exchangers, overlap of substrate specificity, selective tissue distribution, and specific spatial distribution of transporters leading to net vectorial flow of the amino acids. The next frontier for workers in this field is to uncover a comprehensive molecular understanding of the manner by which epithelial cells signal gene expression of transporters as triggered by substrates, hormones or other triggers, to further understand the trafficking and interactions among multimeric transport system proteins, to extend discoveries of novel small drug substrates for oral and ocular delivery, and to examine gene therapy or nanotherapy of diseases using small molecules delivered via amino acid transporters.",
