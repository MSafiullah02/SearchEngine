Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find that the infection fatality rate in Illinois, New York, and Italy is substantially lower than reported.",

            "text": "Now consider each of the component quantities that together determine the infection rate. Assuming that reporting of 32 testing is accurate, daily surveillance reveals the testing rate and the rate of positive results among those tested. Thus, the 33 quantities P(T d = 0), P(T d = 1), P(R d = 0|T d = 1), and P(R d = 1|T d = 1) are directly observable. The remaining quantities 34 are not directly observable. 35 The quantities P(C d = 1|R d = 1) and P(C d = 1|T d = 1, R d = 0) are determined by the accuracy of testing. The former is 36 the positive predictive value (PPV) and the latter is one minus the negative predictive value (NPV). We note that medical 37 researchers and clinicians often measure test accuracy in a different way, through test sensitivity and specificity. The 38 sensitivity and specificity of tests for COVID-19 on the tested sub-population are P(R d = 1|T d = 1, C d = 1) and P(R d 39 = 0|T d = 1, C d = 0) respectively. Sensitivity and specificity are related to PPV and NPV through Bayes Theorem, whose 40 application generally requires knowledge of P(C d = 1|T d = 1), the infection rate in the tested sub-population. An exception 41 to this generalization is that PPV equals one if specificity equals one, whenever sensitivity is positive and P(C d = 1|T d = 1) Medical experts believe that the PPV of the prevalent tests for COVID-19 is close to one, but that NPV may be 1 considerably less than one. We have obtained this information in part from personal communication with an infectious 2 disease specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and in part from the public literature. For example, USA Today has 3 reported as follows 5 : 4 ''Dwayne Breining, executive director for Northwell Labs in New Hyde Park, New York, said the test is extremely 5 accurate and can detect even low levels of the virus. False positives are highly unlikely, he said, though false 6 negatives may result from poor-quality swabs or if the instrument is blocked by mucus. Those factors might have 7 been at play in a number of false negatives initially reported. Patients who continue to have symptoms after a 8 negative test are advised to get retested''. 9 We therefore find it credible to assume that P(C d = 1|R d = 1) = 1. It can be shown that this is equivalent to assuming 10 that test specificity P(R d = 0|T d = 1, C d = 0) = 1. The final sentence of the Breining quote explains part of why it may 11 not be completely accurate to assume that persons are tested at most once. Another reason is that hospitalized patients 12 are tested to verify recovery before they are released from the hospital. Nevertheless, we maintain this assumption for 13 simplicity.",

The 33 fractions P(T d = 1) and P(T d = 0) of the population who have and have not been tested linearly determine the relative 34 contributions of the two sources of uncertainty. 35 36 As of April 2020, the fraction of the population who have been tested is very small in most locations. For example, 37 the fraction who have been tested by April 24, 2020 was about 0.015 in Illinois, 0.04 in New York, and 0.027 in Italy; see 38 Section 3 for details on the data sources. Hence, the present dominant concern is uncertainty about the infection rate in 39 untested sub-populations. We now consider the problem of obtaining a credible bound on this quantity. 7 Failure of a test to detect that a person has been infected may occur for multiple reasons. In the current context, where eligibility for testing requires a person to exhibit symptoms or to have been in recent close contact with a confirmed case, we expect that imperfect administration of tests is the dominant reason for inaccuracy in results. In settings with widespread eligibility for testing, inaccuracy also occurs if a person is tested after recovery from COVID-19. Then a nasal swab test would show no presence of the virus and yield a negative result, missing the fact that the person was infected previously.",

The bound on P(V d = 1|X, C d = 1) is computable if surveillance 3 additionally reports P(V d = 1|X). Table 2 reports the bounds in (13) for Illinois, New York, and Italy, under the monotonicity assumptions presented in 26 Section 2.2. The temporal monotonicity condition is reflected in the fact that, for each state and country, both the lower 27 and upper bounds on P(C d = 1) weakly increase over time. The widths of the bounds varied (non-monotonically) from 28 0.455 to 0.521 for Illinois, with a peak of 0.523; 0.48 to 0.601 for New York, with a peak of 0.613; and remained about 29 0.47 for Italy throughout the period. 30 The substantial width of the bounds reflects the fact, previously discussed, that the fraction of tested individuals 31 was very small throughout the period. Nonetheless, the bounds have substantial informational content relative to the 35 We next bring to bear information on the rate of asymptomatic infections as discussed in Section 2.3. This information 36 does not lower the upper bound on the probability of infection, but it raises the lower bounds. Using the expert opinion 37 15 In all locations, a person is classified as having a confirmed case of the disease by date d if the person has obtained a positive test result by that date. The New York documentation of testing indicates that non-positive results are sub-classified into those that are negative and inconclusive. This sub-classification is not made in the documentation for Illinois and Italy. Receipt of test results may take several days or longer. We are not certain how agencies classify persons while results are still pending. Our analysis interprets the reported data on confirmed cases to exclude cases where test results are pending.",
