Notwithstanding the proven benefits, several studies regarding complications associated with the use of rhBMP-2 have been so far published. Increased rates of infection, postoperative seromas and hematomas, delayed wound healing, dysphagia and neck swelling, retrograde ejaculation, symptomatic radiculitis, vertebral osteolysis, cage subsidence as well as heterotopic bone formation have all been reported following the use of rhBMP-2 in spine surgery (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) .

            "text": "A 65-year-old obese female underwent an open lumbar laminectomy with instrumented allograft postero-lateral fusion using iliac bone graft, local bone, calcium phosphate augmentation and pedicle screws instrumentation at L4-L5 at an outside Institution, with clinical improvement. Three years after the initial surgery, she experienced recurrent low back pain and was diagnosed with pseudo-arthrosis and hardware failure (fractured left L5 pedicle screw) that prompted a revision surgery with fractured hardware removal and extension of the instrumented fusion to S1, bilaterally. At the time of the revision surgery rhBMP-2 was utilized \"off-label\" to promote a successful postoperative postero-lateral arthrodesis. Both initial and revision procedures were performed at the same hospital and by the same surgeon. Three years after the revision surgery she started experiencing recurrent episodes of severe L5 and S1 left radiculopathy and medical management and lumbar steroids injections failed to reduce the severity of the symptoms. This is when we first saw the patient. A clinical examination confirmed the presence of radicular signs and symptoms with no neurological deficits or significant back pain. Lumbar x-rays and CT scan were performed and revealed the presence of new broken hardware on the left side (fractured S1 pedicle screws) as well as significant heterotopic bone formation mainly involving the left L5-S1 lateral recess, leading to severe stenosis and nerve root compression (fig 1-2-3) . Despite the findings of broken hardware, there were no signs of mechanical instability at a flexion-extension x-ray and the CT documented the presence of a solid joint arthrodesis, especially on the right (fig 4-5-6a-6b ). An MRI was also performed which confirmed the diagnosis of severe lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1 due to heterotopic bone formation (fig 7) . Clinically she had only minimal axial low back pain, no radiological signs of mechanical instability, with most of the symptoms being radicular in nature. She was severely obese with a BMI of 40.10 with history of hyperlipedimia, HTN and CAD. After discussing the surgical options with the patient we elected to explore the fusion, remove the broken instrumentation and decompress the involved nerve roots by removing the heterotopic bone formation using a minimally invasive tubular approach. Open surgery with complete revision of instrumentation and redo arthrodesis was also discussed. In light of the absence of significant low back pain, the predominance of radicular symptoms, the absence of mechanical instability and the presence of bilateral facet arthrodesis, as well as the history of previous lumbar surgeries and associated medical comorbidities, we felt a minimally invasive approach was an appropriate option to be selected in this case and the patients concurred with this informed decision.",

METRx tubular system and antero-posterior (AP) and lateral intraoperative fluoroscopy guidance were utilized. A 3 cm incision was made over the AP x-ray projection of the L5-S1 broken screws on the left side and the fascia was open approx. 3-4 cm lateral to the midline, as guided by the x-rays. An Xtube expandable tubular retractor was utilized to expose the L5-S1 hardware. The rod was exposed and any surrounding newly formed bone was carefully drilled away. The rod was then cut using a carbide drill bit and removed. The lower broken screw (S1) was then utilized as landmark to start our microscopic dissection (fig 8) . The borders of the previous laminectomy were the identified, epidural scarring removed and the dura and nerve roots displaced by the presence of the heterotopic bone formation identified. The traversing nerve root was decompressed below the area involved by the ectopic bone formation and the exiting nerve root was isolated and decompressed above it (fig 9-10-11)",

The Xtube was removed and the fascia and would closed using standard techniques. The procedure lasted approx. 90 minutes and blood loss was minimal (<50 cc). In light of the absence of significant low back or radiological signs of mechanical instability, the documented solid arthrodesis on the contralateral side, as well as the presence of retained fractured screws within the L5 and S1 pedicles, we elected not to place supplemental instrumentation. A postoperative CT confirmed good neural decompression (fig 13) and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 1. The radicular symptoms resolved and no recurrent symptoms or complications were recorded at a 1-3 and 6 month follow up. At the most recent clinical follow up (7 years after the minimally invasive surgery) the patient still remains pain free without any significant recurrent radicular symptoms or axial back pain and has been able to resume recreational sport activities.

            "text": "Heterotopic (or ectopic) bone formation is a known complication associated with the of rhBMP-2 during spinal fusion surgery (19, 20, 21) and due to its possible compressive nature this condition may lead to recurrent or worsening symptoms in the postoperative period. Depending on size, symptoms and location of the ectopic bone formation surgical treatment may be needed, posing sometimes a technical challenge especially in patients who already underwent revision surgery of that carry multiple medical comorbidities. In such patients the use of minimally invasive decompressive techniques may be beneficial in tailoring the treatment to the symptomatic condition while minimizing possible adverse effects sometimes associated with open revision surgery. Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) techniques are nowadays utilized by many surgeons as an alternative or adjunct to open spine surgery in the treatment of various degenerative pathologies involving the cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral spine (22, 23, 24, 25) as well as trauma related and tumoral conditions (26, 27) . Centers and surgeons familiar with these novel techniques have also expanded the use and indications of this lesser invasive techniques to deformity correction surgery and revision surgery as well (28, 29, 30) . In our practice we too have expanded the use of MISS techniques as we live in a community were many patients are seen in consultation in their 7 th and 8 th decade of life. Spine surgery in the elderly may be at time challenging as multiple comorbidities, osteopenia/osteoporosis, as well as history of multiple previous spine surgeries need to be carefully considered while selecting the most effective and safe surgical (or non-surgical) approach. Revision spine surgery may also prove challenging as several factors may contribute to render some of these procedures more complicated than others. Lack or paucity of information related to previous surgeries, diagnostic limitation of radiological studies available (e.g. patients with spinal cord stimulators or non-MRI compatible implanted devices) and post-surgical anatomical changes and fibrosis do in fact play an important role during the preoperative and operative decision making process in such patients. Anatomical landmarks may difficult to recognize during revision surgery as post-operative changes, associated deformity and epidural fibrosis may all render the surgeon's evaluation of the operative field at times challenging. This is especially true in MISS where the anatomical exposure is usually limited to the surgical area of interest and in such cases an optimal use of preoperative and intraoperative imaging plays a very important role in facilitating the surgeon during the various steps of the selected approach. MISS offer many benefits in this cohort of patients (elderly, revision surgery, multiple comorbidities) as limited tissue dissection, minimal blood loss, shorter surgery time, faster and easier mobilization, lesser and shorter need for postoperative narcotics are all in favor of the use of such techniques when deemed feasible and appropriate. In the presented case it is unclear when the hardware failed/re-fractured as the patient did not complain of significant low back pain at the time of our initial evaluation. It is indeed possible that the hardware failure happened before the arthrodesis was complete and solid and before the ectopic bone formation became symptomatic. Also we were unable to directly confirm what dose of rhBMP-2 was utilized at the time of the revision surgery, therefore cannot comment on this specific issue as cofactor for the onset of the heterotopic bone formation. Review of previous operative reports revealed that the initial postero-lateral fusion was performed with the use of iliac crest and local bone autograft as well as calcium phosphate allograft augmentation. In light of the recurrence of radicular symptoms and evidence of fractured hardware at L5, the patient underwent a revision surgery with \"exploration of fusion, removal of L5 instrumentation, bilateral transverse process fusion with local bone graft and \"off label\" use of BMP\", as well as left TLIF at L5-S1 with PEEK allograft and L4-S1 bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation.\". According to the operative report there was no presence of heterotopic bone formation at L5-S1 at that time of the revision surgery and the BMP sponges were \"morcellized and placed in smaller pieces, combined with the local bone graft, into both posterolateral gutters\". The amount of BMP utilized was not recorded. The colleague also commented that the \"fixation of the L5 screw on the left side was extremely good and had sustained a fatigue fracture at its base, indicating a solid anchorage in the L5 pedicle\" Therefore such fractured screw was not retrieved at that time. In light of the documented absence of heterotopic bone formation at the time of the revision surgery, the addition of calcium phosphonate to promote the arthrodesis during the initial lumbar fusion does not appear to have played a role in the genesis of the ectopic bone formation in this case, and it appears that this condition is to be associated to the use of rhBMP-2, as previously described (11) . In the presented case an open procedure of revision/decompression/lysis of adhesions could have certainly been utilized but in light of the patient's expectations, the absence of significant low back pain and radiological instability, as well as the presence of numerous medical comorbidities, we chose a minimally invasive approach, which proved to be successful in providing a long lasting relief of the preoperative symptoms. Although the treatment of heterotopic bone formation associate with the use of rhBMP-2 may be challenging, the use of a minimally invasive tubular decompression may facilitate a tailored and safe approach to this condition and should be kept in the armamentarium of spine surgeons, as one of the many valid techniques to be considered and discussed with these patients.",
