The disease is multifactorial and develops in complex interaction between factors associated with the host, the pathogens and the environment. The existing preventive measures therefore include a wide range of strategies. Despite advances of newer and better therapeutic and preventive medications, as well as efforts to improve management and optimize the environment to prevent BRD, the morbidity and mortality rates have not declined. A recent review of evolving views on BRD control measures concludes that blanket vaccination and mass treatment provides inconstant control for BRD and highlights the need to reappraise the use of these measures (1). Our question is, however, if there are alternative strategies to antimicrobial treatment and vaccines that could be effective in reducing the impact of BRD in a sustainable cattle production.",

It is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and economic loss in both the beef and dairy cattle industries (7, 8). Fatalities, treatment costs, and handling of sick animals contribute to the economic losses in the acute stage of an outbreak. Considerably higher number of animals are usually found to have lung-lesions at slaughter, compared to the number of clinical BRD cases in a herd. This indicates that observed clinical cases represent only part of the problem (9). The long-term consequences are also less recognized, but reduced feed conversion, growth rate and performance might contribute considerably to the total economic losses. A long-term reduction in weight gain (7 months) was seen following a BRD outbreak among bulls in Norway (10). Calves with BRD have also been found to produce less milk when they reach first lactation (11). National studies from the UK have estimated costs associated with BRD amounting to \u00a380 million annually for the cattle industry (12). The only scientific publication where the national-level economic effect of BRD has been estimated is from France, where an epidemiology- and productivity model was used to link BRD incidence with productivity in the different cattle industry sectors (13). The authors found that eradication of BRD in beef calves would increase the whole beef sector's productivity by 4.7\u20135.5%, but that the benefits from eradication would differ between enterprises. For example, young bull and veal feedlot enterprises were estimated to increase in productivity by 8.7\u201312.8% while the breeding farms would gain less (5.1\u20136.0%) (13).",

Respiratory disease is the most common reason for metaphylactic antibiotic therapy in the US. 71% of feedlot cattle receive antimicrobials in feed, and 13.4% are treated with injectable antimicrobials to prevent or treat BRD (4). A wide variety of antimicrobials are used, usually broad-spectrum antibiotics including those recommended for human use only (4). In Denmark, BRD accounts for 79% of antimicrobials used in veal calves and young bulls (15). Also in Norway, BRD is the main reason for therapeutic antimicrobial usage in both dairy calves and in the beef industry (16). Reduction of BRD would significantly reduce the total use of antimicrobials in the cattle industry and by that reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance development.",

A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials concluded that antimicrobial prophylaxis and metaphylaxis demonstrated moderate, yet highly variable reductions in the relative risk of BRD morbidity (19). The most substantial reductions of relative risk were from critically important broad-spectrum antimicrobials. However, metaphylactic treatment with macrolides were found to have no effect on incidence of BRD in a controlled trial (20). In addition, a high prevalence of multidrug resistant Mannheimia haemolytica has been found in cattle after metaphylaxis and treatment for BRD (21). Baptiste and Kyvsgaard (19) also concluded that BRD prophylaxis/metaphylaxis represents a major driver of antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in terms of absolute risk reduction of morbidity and mortality. The use of mass medication can hardly be seen as in accordance with the current strategy to prevent antimicrobial resistance through prudent use of antibiotics recommended by the World Health Organization, United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization and World Organization for Animal Health (14). It is therefore necessary to promote control of BRD without the use of antimicrobial mass-medication.",

The development of effective vaccine programmes has been challenging (1). The short duration of immunity provided by vaccines against mucosal viral infections and the need to vaccinate immunologically immature calves in the presence of maternal antibodies have led to suboptimal effect of vaccines and challenge the cost-benefit of its use (1, 22). The effect of vaccination on herd immunity depends on the efficacy of the vaccine, but also on vaccine management such as the proportion of animals vaccinated and the timing of vaccination (23). Several authors have reviewed the vaccine efficacy of BRD vaccines, with conflicting results in calves and feedlot cattle (24, 25), and a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effect of commercially available BRD vaccines showed no significant difference in the risk of BRD in vaccinated calves, compared to controls (26). Despite years of research and advances in vaccine development, the use of vaccines has not provided the wanted effect against BRD.",

Management factors including excessive handling, commingling, and movement of animals increase the risk of BRD due to stress and immunosuppression (3, 27). An important management factor is a good routine for adequate intake of colostrum (8, 28). Annual and seasonal variation in mortality rates due to BRD have been documented, with increased rates during winter (3, 29). This has been partially explained by higher animal density during confined housing, poor ventilation and inclement weather (12). Studies from Scandinavia have found that reduction of the animal density and age span in group-pens along with 1 week of isolation of new-borns from adult cows may prevent BRD (30, 31). Nevertheless, maintenance of good health alone does not result in sufficient reduction of BRD (8), and despite education and consulting of producers on optimal management strategies, it may be difficult to achieve the desired results.",

Viral pathogens such as BRSV, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus and BCoV can cause disease directly, and/or predispose animals to bacterial infections (40\u201344). Most of these primary BRD pathogens are highly contagious viruses that can easily spread between herds (29, 44), either directly through live animal contact/movement, or indirectly through contaminated environment or fomites brought between herds. The most common bacterial agents are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni (44\u201346). These bacteria appear to have lower transmissibility, and bacterial disease in several animals is therefore most likely a result of exposure of animals to the same risk factors, such as virus infection and/or suboptimal environment, at the same time (47). Mycoplasma bovis can also contribute to BRD, either as primary or secondary pathogen. Live animal movement seems to be the primary means by which M. bovis is transmitted between herds (48).",

            "text": "Both BRSV and BCoV can be easily transmitted between herds, and epidemics with rapid spread between herds within a region have been reported (57, 58). Modes of transmission are either directly through live animal contact (59) or indirectly via contaminated personnel or utensils brought between herds (60). Herds with limited or no purchase of cattle may also experience outbreaks of BRD, most likely due to introduction of infectious agents by indirect routes, and/or that the causative pathogen was already circulating in the herd (61). Indirect transmission depends upon the stability of the viruses outside the host, which is generally short for enveloped RNA viruses such as BRSV and BCoV. However, there are uncertainties regarding the stability of both viruses. Under laboratory conditions, BCoV remained infective for 2 weeks under cool and moist conditions (62). For both BRSV and BCoV, temporary carriage of virus on fomites has been shown: infective BCoV was detected on fomites (clothes, boots and equipment) 24 h after exposure to virus-shedding calves, while for BRSV, only viral RNA, and no infectious virus, was detected (60). The same study found that personnel in contact with virus-shedding calves carried both BCoV and BRSV RNA on nasal mucosa, but none were positive for infective virions. It was therefore concluded that transmission of virus via human nasal mucosa is likely limited (60). Airborne transmission for BRSV and BCoV has been shown indoors (63) but is most likely restricted to droplet and aerosol spread. Airborne transmission across longer distances, i.e., between farms, has not been described and is likely of limited importance. Transmission of virus from other species to cattle has never been demonstrated and is likely to be of minor importance under normal circumstances.",

When BRSV and BCoV cause acute infections in individual animals, the viruses replicate locally in the respiratory epithelial cells and are shed in exhaled air and nasal secretions (43, 51). BCoV also infects enterocytes and is excreted in feces (43). Experimental studies have shown shedding of BRSV from day three to nine post infection (46), and from day two to ten for BCoV (66, 67). Viral RNA can be detected for an extended period (67, 68), but might not represent infective virus. Both infections give short-lived immunity (69\u201371). Introduction of virus to a herd usually results in rapid spread and high within-herd prevalence. This is particularly seen during the winter season (50, 72). Depending on factors such as herd size, management and the immunity of the herd, viruses may continue to circulate due to subclinical infections in na\u00efve animals and/or reinfections with viral shedding in seropositive animals (43, 73).",

Is this achievable? The answer depends on cultural and structural conditions of the cattle industry in the area of interest. Introduction of virus could, in principle, be prevented in any herd. However, a synergetic effect can be acquired if measures are implemented by most of the herds in an area or country. How successful a herd's biosecurity measures are also depend upon the infectious pressure from the outside. If this is reduced due to better biosecurity in surrounding herds, the benefit will be mutual. A central, joint organization to run a program through is therefore an advantage.

Earlier positive experiences with disease-control makes it easier to introduce new projects. For example, the Norwegian producers likely have a stronger willingness to participate in joint disease-control efforts, also for non-reportable diseases, due to the successful elimination of bovine virus diarrhea from the cattle population in 2006 (83). This program was established in 1992 by the dairy- and breeding organizations, in collaboration with the animal health authorities. Ringworm due to Trichophyton verrucosum has nearly been eliminated due to an eradication program that combined vaccination and zoosanitary measures (84). Cost-benefit analyses of previous national control programs in the dairy cow and goat sectors have proven that the efforts paid off (85, 86). Motivation is crucial and necessary in order to succeed in implementing measures that requires extra effort.",

Sampling of a group of younger animals has also been used, with the assumption that the selected animals are representative for their age group in the herd e.g., pooled milk samples from primiparous cows. As they usually are 2\u20133 years old, the sample will reflect a herd's infection-history 2\u20133 years prior (77). Serum from a group of calves under 1 year of age will indicate virus circulation within the last year, if calves young enough to have maternal antibodies are excluded. Classification of herds based on serological analysis of a group of animals is therefore possible, and the different options have pros and cons with regard to cost and value. We reiterate that the gap between seropositivity and virus presence is considerable. A seronegative herd is, on the other hand, a good indicator of a virus-free herd, and in the context of a control program, finding the free herds might be most important.",

It is also an ongoing measure that needs to be nourished over time. Basic education, as well as a continuous flow of updated information, is necessary. Knowledge about the occurrence of the infections is useful to motivate action. The impact of BRD is well-recognized among farmers and veterinarians in Norway, and they are usually aware that BRSV and BCoV are the primary pathogens, and that BCoV also causes winter dysentery. This probably makes it easier to motivate the producers for control of BRSV and BCoV in Norway compared to countries with other Specters of BRD pathogens. For BRSV and BCoV, the documented varying prevalence, and presence of negative herds in high-prevalence areas (50, 59), shows the Norwegian producers that it is possible to stay negative also if neighbors are positive. For regions with higher prevalence of BRSV and BCoV, an important step forward would be to perform an antibody-screening with a classification method that gives a recent picture, for example investigation of first-parity cows or young stock before concluding that all herds are positive. For countries with severe problems due to other BRD pathogens such as BVDV, M. bovis and IBR, it is probably wise to focus on these pathogens first.

This is probably more effective in small herds, and the small average herd size in Norway is therefore an advantage. In larger herds, na\u00efve cattle in sufficient numbers might be available all the time, and both acute, subclinical infections and possible persistent infections are more likely. Altogether, control might be more challenging in areas where herds are larger, and more intense monitoring might be necessary. Nevertheless, biosecurity-based control might still succeed if new introduction of virus is avoided, as it will most likely be a question of time before virus cease to circulate also in larger herds.",

There is a need for herd-level diagnostic tools that accurately classify the herds in a cost-efficient manner. Serological investigations will result in an overestimation of prevalence, as earlier discussed. In the Norwegian test-regime the small average herd size might cause few first-parity cows or calves to be available, consequently reducing the herd-sensitivity. The within-herd prevalence is to some degree unknown and probably variable between herds, and within groups in the herds, which further complicates the matter. In the control program, the test-result is valid for a full year. The probability of virus introduction after classification is considerable, particularly in herds that purchase animals. An updated herd-classification based on the combination of bulk milk tank testing, herd size, information on animal movements and geographical location has been shown to provide a more accurate estimate of herd status (95) and could potentially improve progress of the program.",

Our average dairy herd comprises 27 cows and suckler-cow herds 23, and there is an absence of feed-lots as well as few and small fattening herds. In addition, herd size might also influence the time until a new infection is detected. In Norway, the number of animals tested is the same regardless of size. In herds with many animals a control program with a more intense diagnostic test regime regarding both number of animals tested and frequency of testing, might be necessary. Herd sizes are increasing in Norway, which coincides with an increase in the recorded number of infectious diseases (96). Infection control in areas with larger herds is therefore likely to be more challenging, but even more necessary and rewarding if successful.",

The financial losses due to BRSV and BCoV in Norway were analyzed by the industry prior to onset of the program. This included the available knowledge of the viruses' effect on BRD and winter dysentery, and the costs of running a control program were weighted against the impact (not published). It was concluded that controlling BRSV and BCoV would be cost-efficient and should be prioritized. There are several uncertainties in such an analysis. In a study from France, the authors assumed that a reduction of BRD incidence between 20 and 50% was a realistic outcome to expect from improvements in farm biosecurity (13), but further studies that link epidemiology and livestock productivity in a larger scale is needed.",

Successful control of BRSV and BCoV here could motivate to action also in other countries. Effects on public health is a profound reason for animal disease control. The expected benefits is considerable regarding the usage of antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance, in agreement with the present OIE strategy (90). Another expected \u201cby-product\u201d of the control program is the likely reduction of infections caused by other pathogens transmitted via the same routes, both endemic and emerging pathogens.
