After showing some evidence of human and non-human primate PV recombination, we report a comprehensive recombination analysis of all currently known 82 Alphapapillomaviruses (Alpha-PVs). We carried out an exploratory study and found novel recombination events between High-Risk HPV Types and Macaca fascicularis PV1 (MfPV1), Macaca Fuscata PV2 (MfuPV2) and Pan Paniscus PV1 (PpPV1) Papillomaviruses. This is the first evidence of interactions between PVs from different hosts and hence postulates the likelihood of ancient host switching among Alpha-PVs. Notwithstanding these results should be interpreted with caution because the major and minor parents indicated by RDP4 program are simply the sequences in the alignment that most closely resemble the actual parents. We found statistically significant differences between the phylogenies of the PV sequences with recombination regions and PV sequences without recombination regions using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa phylogenetic incongruence testing. We show that not more than 76MYA Alpha-PVs were in the same biological niche, a pre-requisite for recombination, and as the hosts evolved and diversified, the viruses adapted to specific host niches which eventually led to coevolution with specific hosts before speciation of primate species. Thus providing evidence that in ancient times no earlier than the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic age, Alpha-PVs recombined and switched hosts, but whether this host switching is occurring currently is unknown. However, a clearer picture of the PVs evolutionary landscape can only be achieved with the incremental discovery of PV sequences, especially from the animal kingdom.",

Genera are named according to the Greek alphabet from alpha to omega, and following exhaustion of the alphabet the term dyo and treis (Greek for second time and third, respectively) coined to accommodate the extra genera e.g. dyo-deltapapillomaviruses (Bernard et al. 2010) . There are about 405 known reference PVs uptodate as listed in the curated PAVE database (https ://pave.niaid .nih.gov/), 226 of these are human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and 179 from different animal species (Van Doorslaer and Dillner 2019). HPVs are the most studied and are distributed over 5 genera (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Mu and Nu) . The other PV genera are from other mammals, birds and reptiles (Bernard et al. 2010) . Below the genus level are species and below the species level are PV types (de Villiers et al. 2004 ). Different genera have less than 60% similarity within the L1 gene, while species share between 60 and 70% similarity and types share between 71 and 89% similarity. The ICTV is responsible for nomenclature of viruses down to species level, and below species level, the International Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Reference Centre (Karonliska Institute, Sweden) and the Animal Papillomavirus Reference Centre (University of Arizona, USA) assigns unique PV-type numbers after the complete genome has been sequenced, cloned and confirmed by the Centre (M\u00fchr et al. 2018) .",

The general assumption is that PVs have coevolved with their hosts (Chen et al. 2009a; Bravo and Felez-Sanchez 2015; Dube Mandishora et al. 2018 ). Selection pressures due to host immune responses differ among PV genes and result in these genes displaying different substitution rates. Further, the cellular polymerases of different host species may differ in their degree of fidelity such that virus lineages infecting different hosts might display different substitution rates (de Oliveira et al. 2015) . The popular views about PV evolution have been (1) they are static and slow evolving viruses with very low mutation rates (2) host linked co-divergence (3) strict tissue tropism (4) host specific and (5) lack of recombination (Bravo et al. 2010) . However, the understanding of PV evolution has advanced over the years, with various alternative mechanisms such as inter-species transmission, adaptive radiation and recombination (Angulo and Carvajal-Rodriguez 2007; Carvajal-Rodriguez 2008; Gottschling et al. 2011; Robles-Sikisaka et al. 2012) .",

The observed differences for the 405A1 and A2, 343A1 and A2 trees (deltaL values) are significantly greater than zero and the null hypothesis was rejected, thus declaring that these trees are significantly different i.e. incongruent (p < 0.05).

These recombination events were between High-Risk HPV Types and Macaca fascicularis PV1 (MfPV1), Macaca Fuscata PV2 (MfuPV2) and Pan Paniscus PV1 Fig. 1 Alphapapillomavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis of all the 82 human and animal Alpha-PVs whole genomes. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v7.221 (Edgar 2004) . A maximumlikelihood tree of the nucleotide sequences was generated in PhyML using the optimal model of evolution (GTR+G) as determined within MEGA 7 (Kumar et al. 2016) . The Newick format of the tree was uploaded and modified in iTOL https ://itol.embl.de/tree/ (PpPV1) PVs. This observation provides the first evidence of interactions between PVs from different hosts and the likelihood of ancient host switching among Alpha-PVs, thus refuting, host specificity, a central dogma in PV evolution. Chen et al 2009b also postulated that an overlapping set of MfPVs in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques indicates non-human primate Alpha-PVs may not strictly be host specific (Chen et al. 2009b) . The same authors also report that members of the alpha-12 species (non-human primate PVs) are closely related to the members of the alpha-9 species (High-risk HPVs) and alpha-11 species as also shown in Fig. 1 . The most important biological prerequisite for recombination to occur is that two virus sequences be in the same space at the same time. So ancestral non-human primate PVs and HPVs should have been in the same space (biological niche) and time if recombination events had to occur as shown above. This unlikely event of cross-host infection by PVs challenges one of PVs central evolutionary tenets. Our findings provide the first likely evidence of such, but we are not the first authors to hypothesize this. Chen et al 2019 showed that non-human primate PVs share similar evolutionary histories and niche adaptation as the human counterparts (Chen et al. 2019) , using the example of HPV16 and MfPV3 that evolved from a most recent common ancestor containing the determinants of carcinogenicity. In another study, Chen et al 2018 also reported on the possibility of niche adaptation and viral transmission of HPVs from archaic hominins to modern humans, the archaic hominin-host-switch model .",

We predict, based on the time tree (https ://www. timet ree.org/about ) that the recombination between High-Risk HPV Types, Cynomolgus & Japanese Macaques and Bonobos PVs may have occurred not more than 76 million years ago (Smelov et al. 2018) , at the time of the last common ancestor of all primates. Chen et al. demonstrated specific host niche adaptation of primate PVs ensued thereafter by host co-divergence to have occurred at least 40MYA (Chen et al. , 2019 , which concurs with our prediction. Our observation suggests that more than 76MYA these viruses were in the same biological niche (same host). As the hosts evolved and diversified, the viruses adapted to specific host niches, which eventually led to coevolution with specific hosts, and this occurred before the speciation events of all primate host species including humans. Recombination events among Cetacean PVs detected in this study have also been previously reported elsewhere (Robles-Sikisaka et al. 2012), but were not the mainstay of this study.",

These infections create a conducive environment for recombination to occur within the same biological niche or anatomical site through availing or enhancing DNA viral load, which in turn increases the probability of genomes to recombine.

However, the Alpha-PVs A1 and A2 trees showed congruence, seemingly rendering recombination an unimportant driving force in their evolution. The congruence can be explained by the low number (82) of Alpha-PV sequences currently available for the analysis to make inferential conclusions. Thus, the low number of sequences imply a lack of power for detection of phylogenetic incongruence. Moreover, the fact that essentially 7 sequences (PpPV1, MfPV7, HPV54, HPV70, HPV68, HPV39 and HPV66) of the 82 Alpha-PVs showed recombination events explains how these could not have changed the phylogeny of the whole Alpha-PV genus, with or without recombination regions from these 7 sequences. Thus, recombination plays a role in their evolution as shown in the dispersion of non-human-primate PVs across the Alpha-PV phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 .",

Thus providing evidence that in ancient times no earlier than the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic age, Alpha-PVs recombined and switched hosts, but whether this host switching is occurring currently is unknown. It is important to fully understand the evolutionary history of different PVs to better inform carcinogenicity and novel vaccine development.",
