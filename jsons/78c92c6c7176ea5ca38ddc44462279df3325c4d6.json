The first is suppression: rigorous, sometimes outright draconian, social distancing measures are taken by national governments, such as closing schools and public places, issuing stay-at-home orders, closing non-essential industrial and commercial activities, banning all kind of non-essential F travel, etc. The goal in this case is to reduce the reproduction number R t , which is the number of persons an infectious person infects on average, below unity, causing the outbreak to subside. This approach was followed very thoroughly by China, where the original outbreak developed [1] , effectively suppressing the epidemic in a couple of months time. This approach was subsequently followed, albeit with much less draconian restrictions, by most Western European countries, in particular by Italy, who was hit first and hardest. Some countries, most notably South Korea, adopted a suppression strategy based on extensive tracking and early isolation of infected people, in order to achieve the same effects of general lock-down in a less socially disruptive way.",

Their a priori predictive power is thus inherently limited when dealing with COVID-19, for which there is no prior experience, there are no effective drugs or vaccines, and only social distancing methods are available to limit the spread of the disease and its consequences. This is clearly shown by the results of the study [7] , which tries to estimate the effect of various types of government interventions onto the relative reduction of the reproduction number R t , by applying Bayesian methods to data from 11 European countries. The initial reproduction number R 0 is estimated to be well above 2, possibly even about 4 in some countries. Hence, a reduction of the reproduction number by at least 60-70%, possibly more, is necessary to avoid the exponential growth of cases.",

This problem is inherent to the requirement of a large enough data set to be statistically significant, which requires to put countries with very different social habits and very different interpretations of the same measure (e.g. lockdown) in the same data set, inevitably leading to very large uncertainty in the estimation of their effects.",

A certain fraction \u03c3, about 4% in Northern Italy, eventually requires mechanical ventilation and intensive care for a period from a few days to a couple of weeks to sustain the patient's life functions. Absent the possibility of adequate life support, this fraction of patients is more likely to die because of respiratory failure, increasing the mortality rate dramatically. 7) The number of beds, equipment, and personnel which is required to perform artificial ventilation on patients in public health systems is based on normal needs of postsurgery care, trauma care, and care of people with rare but serious diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with relatively small extra capacity. The number N ic of COVID-19 patients that can be admitted to intensive and sub-intensive care is thus severely limited. While the actual numbers vary widely by country, the typical order of magnitude is 10 \u22124 N . During the very short time span of the initial phases of the outbreak, this number can be significantly expanded if timely action is taken, but certainly not by orders of magnitude. 8) The initial dynamics of the outbreak is very fast, with doubling times of reported cases of the order of 4 days. 9) The moment an infected patient becomes infectious is still not fully clear. There are some indications that patients, who later report severe symptoms and get tested because of that, started becoming infectious two days before the onset of fever. Furthermore, in most countries people only get tested when they develop serious symptoms, which can delay the moment they are tested by many days. There is thus a time delay \u03c4 t of several days on average between the moment people become infectious, and the moment they get tested. This delay is critical for decision and control. 10) The testing process also introduces a delay in the process. Although in principle it is possible to provide the results of the test in a few hours, the average time to report the results is normally much longer, because of logistic constraints and because of limited availability of analytical equipment. For example, the average time required to obtain the test results in Lombardy during the second week of March 2020 was about one week. This delay \u03c4 r is also critical for decision and control.",

Anyone familiar with basic control theory will immediately recognize this situation as a guaranteed recipe for disaster [11] , [12] . 4) Control feasibility: Well-known results from the theory of limitations of control can now be applied. In order to guarantee some robustness of the system performance against the large gain uncertainty of the process, the Bode plot of L(j\u03c9) should maintain a roughly constant slope over a sufficiently wide interval around the crossover frequency \u03c9 c , thus approximating Bode's ideal loop transfer function. The analysis reported in [12] , Sect. 4.6, leads to conclude that in the most favourable case the product of the unstable pole p and of the time delay T should be pT < 0.326 for the process to be controllable. If one wants to limit the maximum norm of the sensitivity function M s < 2, for increased robustness, the limit is even more stringent, namely pT < 0.156. Using the notation of this paper, these conditions become:",

This paper analyses the problem from a control systems perspective, casting it as a feedback control problem, as it actually is, and using a simple model that captures the control-relevant dynamic behaviour of sufficiently homogeneous territories, in which certain public health measures are applied. The model was validated in two cases, one corresponding to a draconian lockdown in the Hubei province of China, the other one to the application of severe, but milder social distancing measures in the region of Lazio, Central Italy.",
