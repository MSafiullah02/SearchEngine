The CCS Rapid Response Team has already provided guidance on the use of procedures and clinic space during this time (Table 1\n) [1-12]. This is predicated, however, on cardiac sciences programs maintaining their workforce.",

With meetings and travel cancelled, the focus should be both on maintaining clinical expertise in all areas of cardiovascular medicine and reducing personal risk. Every effort should be made to avoid exposure for healthcare professionals over the age of 60 and those with certain underlying conditions, particularly in circumstances where risk may be higher (such as a COVID-19 patient requiring intubation). In a group practice situation, where each member maintains personal patients, now may be the time \u201cshare\u201d patients, such that follow up can be done by these higher risk individuals, keeping them safe, while at the same time offloading the workload of other clinicians who are providing front-line care.

A 2019 survey conducted by the America College of Cardiology suggests that 35% of cardiovascular practitioners were experiencing burnout while 44% acknowledged symptoms of stress [18]. Social support helps alleviate burnout; in this pandemic some of these supports are harder to find, or they look and feel different. We are not having coffee with our friends, or going to the gym. We are potentially isolating ourselves from our families for their own safety; we are hearing of colleagues who are writing their wills, providing advance care directives, and deciding who will take their children. We are intubating our colleagues. Some are dying from this.",

The app is free to download, and contains a rapid assessment tool to assess a spectrum of healthy adaptive coping through to distress and severe functional impairment (mood, attitude and performance, sleep, physical symptoms, social behaviour, alcohol and gambling).
