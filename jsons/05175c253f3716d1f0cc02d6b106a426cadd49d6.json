Study Design: We compared PCR.Ai to our existing manual interpretation, to determine accuracy and hands-on time savings. PCR.Ai was accurate. Results and Conclusions: There was 100% concurrence between validated respiratory virus and norovirus detection by our manual routine analysis method and PCR.Ai. Furthermore, there were significant routine savings with PCR.Ai of 45 min/respiratory run and 32 min/norovirus run.

PCR.Ai identifies positive and negative amplification curves and highlights ambiguous results requiring further analysis, by analysing each curve shape both individually and in the context of run/assay history. The system automatically validates qPCR runs by assessing positive controls using user-defined rules such as Westgard Medlab QC 3 St Dev rule, interprets the IC values and examines negative controls. It can also verify qPCR runs by assessing quantitation standards and will quantify positive traces by comparing them to standard curves.

In general, interpretation of the positive and negative controls was also concordant as was the validation/verification decision/outcome.

It is likely that this is a reflection of the different methods used to assess sample inhibition. The manual method compares the Ct value of the internal control to a retrospective rule based on the first 20 runs with that batch of internal control. In our opinion the PCR.Ai method is more likely to be accurate, as unlike the manual method it automatically calculates the average based on samples in that run, giving a tighter range. In addition PCR.Ai analyses IC trace quality as well as Ct. As a result, PCR.Ai is likely to pick up inhibited samples that could be missed by the rule-based system.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the WoSSVC has strict qPCR run interpretation guidelines with in-built double checks that may be over and above that in place in other laboratories (perhaps no double checks etc). PCR.Ai was also able to interpret large mixed qPCR plates (i.e. plates containing > 1 multiplex assay with multiple controls), as encountered when assessing the respiratory qPCR. When questioned, staff found it to be easy to use and required minimal training (data not shown).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Accurate interpretation of samples and controls"}, {"text": "Our data also showed the PCR.Ai system to be quicker than the established manual system. For the respiratory qPCR, there was an average time-saving of 45 min per run. A saving of 5 min per run was achieved for the initial interpretation process (i.e. setting the threshold and identification of problem curves). A far larger saving of 40 min per run was achieved for the verification/validation steps (e.g. second check and entering control data into Westgard). This probably reflects the fact that PCR.Ai does this automatically, whereas the manual system is reliant on the second checker reviewing the whole run. During our review, further delays were observed when the second checker was unavailable to carry out checks and Westgard entry (e.g. breaks, other runs to interpret, meetings, end of shift, absence etc). Applying these savings to a whole year of respiratory service would result in a time saving of 160 h per year based on one run per day over a 5 day week. In reality, we tend to run more than one respiratory qPCR per day and offer our service 7 days a week. Similar savings of 32 min per run were achieved for the norovirus qPCR (the lower time savings likely reflect that this is a more straightforward assay to interpret due to it having less targets and associated controls). If we were to apply PCR.Ai to the remainder of our qPCR tests (> 20) this would significantly increase the overall savings to the laboratory. We would expect that in laboratories with less qPCR expertise and efficiency, time savings would be greater.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PCR.Ai offers more rapid qPCR run interpretation and verification than the current manual interpretation system"}, {"text": "PCR.Ai is straightforward to learn and use. Expertise is only required for the final check of each run (i.e. are ambiguous traces negative, positive or indeterminate). Currently in the WOSSVC we use highly experienced biomedical scientists for the entire process. The ease of use of PCR.Ai may allow us to use less skilled staff to do the initial qPCR process download. We would then only require more skilled staff for the second check. This could lead to further staff savings and would allow us to redistribute skilled staff within the department. It would also have a clinical impact as tests will have better TRT and a higher throughput, as more samples can be processed per day. This will lead to further cost benefits relating to improved patient care. It should increase the number of tests which can be performed on our outof-hours service.

This could be due to assays being \"messy\" and having many ambiguous traces to interpret. Furthermore, in our laboratory, quantitative assays are often considered by staff to be more complex than qualitative assays and take longer to interpret. We have also encountered differences between the software used by different qPCR platforms, which can in turn affect the ease of result and run interpretation. Consequently, we find that some staff attempt to avoid particular assays, whereas others can become stuck on one particular assay as the resident expert. Taken together such issues can result in variable expertise between the \"expert\" staff members. Use of PCR.Ai, should standardise the interpretation of all in-house qPCR assays within the laboratory irrespective of test complexity or platform used. Tests will no longer be only under the auspices of particular staff. Furthermore, its ease of use should allow laboratories to use less skilled and experienced staff to interpret such assays. This is beneficial to laboratories already with such assays and could lead to restructuring of staff within a department. It is also beneficial to laboratories without such assays or staff expertise, as now they will be easier to implement and interpret, and lead to better access to qPCR technology (either in-house or commercial kits).

For example, for each run it is possible to see the user who carried out the run, any decisions relating to samples or controls (and who made these decisions), as well as the outcome. Presently it would be difficult for most laboratories to keep such information. This aspect is excellent for various accreditation systems (e.g. ISO15189 as now mandated by UKAS). Furthermore, as all the PCR.Ai data is stored in a single database, it is simple to automatically produce reports that currently are done manually -for example validation reports for new assays, controls, EQA panels or other qPCR reagents.
