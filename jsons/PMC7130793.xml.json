            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) causes haemorrhagic gastroenteritis primarily in 2\u20136-month-old pups [1]. CPV-2, first identified in the late 1970s, was replaced a few years after its emergence by two antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b. Those two types are now distributed worldwide [2]. More recently, a third antigenic variant, CPV-2c, was first reported in Italy [3]. Subsequently, it was reported in Vietnam [4], Spain [5], Germany and the United Kingdom (Decaro, unpublished data). This new variant appears to be replacing CPV-2b in the Italian dog population [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The CPV variants differ in amino acid changes occurring at residue 426 of the capsid protein, with types 2a\u20132c displaying amino acids Asn, Asp and Glu, respectively [2], [3]. This residue is located in a major antigenic site close to epitope B, i.e., over the shoulder region of the capsid in a region considered to affect viral immunogenicity. Concerns have been expressed that the antigenic differences between CPV type 2 and its variants may decrease the effectiveness of the CPV-2-based vaccines [12], [13], [14]; however, type 2b vaccines are now licensed in several countries and some investigators recommend their extensive use [15].",

MGB probes are short TaqMan probes conjugated with molecules that form hyper-stabilised duplexes with complementary DNA, allowing reduction in length of the probe and an increase in specificity [16]. MGB probes are, therefore, an attractive tool for revealing single nucleotide polymorphisms in the capsid protein gene between types 2a and 2b and types 2b and 2c. Since the assays differentiating types 2a/2b and type 2b/2c did not discriminate between vaccine and field strains, additional MGB probe assays were developed.",

Such assays could be of practical help, since gastroenteritis in pups within 1 week after CPV vaccination occurs frequently in practice (Buonavoglia, personal observation).

As regards the Scottish dog, the vaccine used and the day of vaccination were unknown; the two exceptional Italian dogs also received vaccines that were uncertain. Six of the dogs had been imported to Italy from Poland (n\n = 3) or Hungary (n\n = 3), but vaccine had been administered in Italy.

Specimens that tested positive for CPV vaccine strains and negative for viral pathogens were examined for bacterial and parasitic pathogens by standardised methods. For bacterial screening the faecal samples were plated onto MacConkey's agar (Oxoid S.p.A., Garbagnate Milanese, Italy), whereas detection of the most common enteric parasites was achieved using zinc sulphate flotation. The Ziehl Nielsen staining was also performed for detection of Cryptosporidium spp.",

Thirteen samples were from dogs vaccinated with CPV-2, one sample was from a dog vaccinated with CPV-2b and one sample from a dog vaccinated with an unknown formulation. A CPV-2 vaccine strain and a CPV-2a field strain were detected simultaneously in the other three samples; two were from dogs administered a type-2-based vaccine and one from a dog given an unknown vaccine. Eleven samples, including seven and three samples collected from dogs vaccinated with CPV-2 and CPV-2b, respectively, and one sample from a dog administered an unknown vaccine, were found to contain only the vaccine virus. Other canine pathogens were detected in 8 of 11 samples, including CCoV type I, CCoV type II and Isospora canis. The remaining three samples contained only vaccine strains: CPV-2 (one sample); CPV-2b strain SAH (two samples). There was no evidence of other viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens. In the two samples positive for CPV-2a (128/05; 206/05), the co-presence of MRV strains was found that gave a signal only in the nested PCR assay. The MRVs could not be characterised by type-specific RT-PCR assays [20]. One sample (206/05) was found positive for CDV by a real-time RT-PCR assay [25]. In order to rule out the vaccine origin of the CDV strain, partial sequences of the haemagglutinin gene were obtained by RT-PCR amplification and subsequent sequence analysis showed that it clustered with field strains of the European lineage [29].",

In both instances, conventional diagnostic tests could not provide definitive results. In fact, virus isolation from faecal samples in cell cultures is poorly sensitive [8], especially in mixed infections; furthermore, it may allow the isolation of only the most adapted (vaccine) or most abundant (field) strain. Unless sequencing of several clones is carried out, PCR may selectively, or more efficiently, amplify either of the viruses, so that the other one remains undetected by subsequent sequence analysis. Moreover, the use of conventional tests, e.g., haemagglutination, immunochromatographic test, virus isolation, or PCR, may misdiagnose diarrhoeic dogs as CPV-infected due to the presence of a MLV strain in the faeces. On the other hand, the novel MGB probe assays represent an effective tool for rapid discrimination between vaccine and field strains of CPV-2 since they are able to detect vaccine and field strains that occur simultaneously in the faeces of vaccinated dogs, even when low titres of vaccine strains are shed [17], [18].",
