Scrimshaw et el. in their pioneering studies helped to delineate the contribution of infectious diseases to the aetiology of childhood malnutrition. This role was reinforced by longitudinal field-based studies in rural areas of Central America' and Bangladesh3 which documented the contribution particularly of episodes of diarrhoea, to acute and chronic malnutrition, and high rates of death in infants and young children in such environments. We now understand that, because of the negative impact of malnutrition on humoral, mucosal and cellular immune defence mechanisms4 children from vulnerable backgrounds become enmeshed in a vicious cycle of 'malnutritioninfectionmalnutrition'. Infectious diarrhoeas are particularly important in this context because of anorexia, vomiting, gastrointestinal losses of fluids, nutrients and electrolytes, loss of body weight and the negative effect of infection on energy balance. Furthermore, this situation is often complicated by co-existing diseases such as respiratory tract infections, intestinal parasites and, in many parts of the world, malaria. Despite intense local and international efforts over recent years, malnutrition, vaccine-preventible diseases and other infections kill millions of infants and children annually around the world.s",

In the Northern Territory, Ellen Kettle had attempted to develop normal growth curves for Aboriginal children by studying, prospectively and monthly, more than 200 Aboriginal infants from coastal mission settlements in Arnhem Land.6 However, many of her subjects had gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, parasitic infestations and severe anaemia which often cause unsatisfactory growth patterns in early childhood. Crotty had previously described anaemia and malnutrition in Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory' and later work from Central Australia re-emphasised the widespread nature of growth faltering and failure to thrive in young aborigine^.^,^ Moodie\" highlighted the poor standards of health by collating information about morbidity and mortality in Aboriginal children from different parts of Australia in a book\" and an annotated bibliography on this subject.\" This has been brought up to date to the m i d -l 9 8 0~. '~ Jose and Welch,14 in more than 2,000 children from six Aboriginal settlements in Queensland, found half of those aged six months to three years were growth retarded, one half of that group being anaemic and infected as well. They described this as 'growth retardation, anaemia and infection with malabsorption and infestation of the bowel' and, drawing the analogy with the situation in children in developing countries, referred to this as 'the syndrome of protein-calorie malnutrition'. Such reports and many subsequent ones established that undernutrition and infections are common and serious problems in Australian Aboriginal children. under five years,z6 and is a frequent cause of severe anaemia from gastrointestinal bleeding in young aborigine^.^' Infestation with Strongyloides stercoralis can be so heavy as to cause partial intestinal obstruction.'@ In Aboriginal children with diarrhoea, intestinal bacterial infections are important, for example, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enterotoxigenic Acromonas, Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter. Intestinal parasites such as Giardia lamblia are very common but are as frequent in Aboriginal children without diarrhoea as from those who have it.'' Viral infections have been associated with outbreaks of diarrhoea in Central A u~t r a l i a . A problem with most of the published reports is that they are from patients in hospitals, hospital admission statistics or ad hoc cross-sectional surveys and therefore provide little information about the extent or severity of diarrhoea1 disease in children in Aboriginal communities. A study in remote communities in tropical north-western Australia showed that isolations of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were much more frequent in the wet monsoonal summer than in the dry winter season even in children under five years who did not have diarrhoea and were believed not to have had diarrhoea A recent, year-long, prospective, community-based study of more than 100",

Weight gain rates in Aboriginal children do not recover until 18 months to two years of age, by which time the 'average' Aboriginal boy is 1.5 kg lighter and 4.5 cm shorter and the 'average' Aboriginal girl 1.1 kg lighter and 3.6 cm shorter than the expected median measurements.80 In Aboriginal children in north-west Australia, 'catch up' growth is usually lacking or ineffective.
