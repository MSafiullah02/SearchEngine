While cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the most prominent virus in transplantation, and the clinical manifestations and complications of infection with other herpesviruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesviruses 6 and 8) are well described, improvements in diagnostic techniques have led to the recognition of a number of additional viruses with potential pathogenicity in the immunocompromised host. Outbreaks of emerging viruses, the resurgence of vaccine-preventable viral infections, and the identifi cation of viruses which cause selflimited infection in immunocompetent children but signifi cant disease in transplant recipients have highlighted the breadth of pathogens in this patient population. Some of these emerging and unusual viral pathogens are discussed in alphabetical order below.",

Several recent reports have highlighted the impact of this RNA virus on immunocompromised hosts. In addition to its role in gastroenteritis in these patients, one astrovirus subgroup (VA1/HMO-C) has been reported to cause encephalitis in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and children with X-linked agammaglobulinemia [ 4 , 5 ] . Molecular techniques including reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RNA sequencing, and next-generation sequencing have demonstrated the presence of this subgroup in the cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) and brain tissue of infected patients. Immunohistochemical staining on biopsy tissue has confi rmed the presence of invasive infection. There are no known antiviral treatments available, and central nervous system (CNS) infection has been fatal in the cases reported to date. Additional study is needed to determine the prevalence of astrovirus infection in transplanted patients.",

Thirty percent of children develop hypoxia, and a variety of radiographic fi ndings have been reported, including peribronchial cuffi ng, lobar infi ltrates, and pleural effusions. Nosocomial infection has occurred [ 8 ] . Bocavirus infection has been reported in the fi rst few weeks following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, presenting with fever, rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, and hypoxia [ 9 ] . Virus has been detected in high quantities in plasma, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and stool. Fecal shedding occurs for several weeks to months after clinical resolution of infection [ 10 ] . Severe and prolonged diarrhea has been described in liver transplant and hematopoietic stem cell recipients [ 11 ] . It has been suggested that bocavirus, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfl uenza, may play a role in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans, a manifestation of chronic rejection in lung transplantation [ 12 -14 ] .

Half of patients also develop a rash, which can be maculopapular, petechial, or bullous and is most commonly located on the trunk, with occasional involvement of the face, extremities, palms, and soles. Ocular pain has also been reported. Rarely, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, or hepatitis can occur. Symptoms resolve in 7-10 days, although arthralgias and joint stiffness may persist for weeks to months after fever resolves. Severe manifestations of infection with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients with underlying diabetes, lung disease, or chronic neurologic conditions. Laboratory fi ndings include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and hypocalcemia. Diagnosis may be made serologically or by RT-PCR. IgM antibodies develop as fever resolves, typically 1 week after symptom onset. There is currently no known effective antiviral therapy for chikungunya.",

In one study of HSCT recipients, human metapneumovirus was isolated via RT-PCR in 26% of symptomatic patients undergoing bronchoscopy and carried a mortality rate of 80% [ 95 ] . Infection occurred within the fi rst few weeks following transplant, and was characterized by fever, nasal congestion, and cough, with rapid development of hypoxia, hypotension, and progressive pneumonia, with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in three of fi ve patients [ 94 -96 ] . Pleural effusions and nodular infi ltrates may be seen, which may help differentiate infection from RSV. Coinfection with RSV, rhinovirus, and CMV has been described following lung transplantation [ 97 ] .",

This fl avivirus was fi rst detected in the northeastern USA in 1999 and has caused outbreaks of infection in the late summer and early fall throughout the USA since then [ 184 , 185 ] . Birds are the primary reservoir of infection. Mosquitoes acquire lifelong infection after biting viremic birds, spreading infection from their salivary glands to other species, including humans, with a subsequent bite. In human infection, the incubation period is 2-14 days [ 186 ] . While approximately 80% of infections are asymptomatic, 20% of patients develop West Nile fever, characterized by fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, myalgias, headache, and occasionally lymphadenopathy [ 187 ] . One in 150 symptomatic patients develops meningitis and/or encephalitis [ 188 ] . Meningitis presents with photophobia, phonophobia, meningismus, and hyperrefl exia; CSF analysis reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis (<500 leukocytes/mm 3 , glucose usually normal). Patients with encephalitis develop altered mental status, cranial nerve palsies, seizures, and movement disorders. A minority of patients develop rapid asymmetric weakness that may progress to fl accid paralysis mimicking poliomyelitis, associated with hyporefl exia or arefl exia [ 184 , 189 , 190 ] . Acute neuromuscular respiratory failure may develop, which carries a mortality rate of more than 50% [ 188 ] . Hemorrhagic fever characteristic of other fl aviviruses has also been described [ 191 ] . The presence of severe weakness and hyporefl exia in a patient with meningoencephalitis should raise the suspicion of WNV infection. MRI may demonstrate meningeal or periventricular enhancement, sometimes mimicking ischemic changes [ 186 ] .",

A delayed serologic response was noted in the transplanted cohort in which infection carried a mortality rate of 25%, versus 9% in the general population.

An IgM antibody capture assay is available and becomes positive in CSF 3-5 days after onset of symptoms in nonimmunosuppressed hosts [ 202 , 207 ] , before serum antibody develops; CSF IgG appears approximately 5 days later. Antibody presence may be confi rmed with viral neutralization studies. IgM antibodies may persist in serum for up to 12 months after infection resolution, and IgG may persist for years. As in the hematopoietic stem cell recipients noted above, immunocompromised patients demonstrate delayed seroconversion, making diagnosis of acute infection diffi cult at times. Nucleic acid testing in plasma and/or CSF is the most useful diagnostic test in this setting [ 208 ] .",

Serology may be of limited value in immunocompromised hosts in the diagnosis of acute infection as well as in detecting reactivation of latent infections. Multiplex, quantitative real-time PCR assays are now available to detect multiple viruses, including panels of PCRs for detection of respiratory viruses and CNS pathogens [ 216 , 217 ] . These sensitive techniques are being evaluated carefully in transplant populations for their specifi city and for their potential utility as markers of early infection with surveillance monitoring. The impact of community-acquired respiratory viral infections on the development of acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplantation appears to be signifi cant and warrants further study [ 218 , 219 ] . Continued vigilance in detecting emerging viral infections and continued study of potential antiviral therapies in the transplant population will likely improve patient survival.",
