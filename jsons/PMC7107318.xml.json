Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was approved by the ethics committee at the Charit\u00e9 clinic (projects EA2/050/08 and EA2/023/07). Tumor-free normal lung tissue was immediately stamped into small cylinders (height \u223c3; diameter 8 mm) and incubated in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1649 medium (containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. After overnight incubation, lung organ cultures were inoculated with 4 \u00d7 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of virus for 1 hour, followed by 3 washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess virus. For growth-curve analysis, supernatants were titrated on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by standard plaque assay, as described elsewhere [30]. MDCK cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium (containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics). The viruses used for this study included the HPAIV A/Thailand/1(Kan-1)/2004 (Thai/04[H5N1]) strain isolated from a fatal human case, the pandemic A/Bayern/63/2009 (Bay/09[H1N1pdm]) strain, the seasonal A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (NC/99[H1N1]) and A/Panama/2007/1999 (Pan/99[H3N2]) strains, the low-pathogenicity avian virus A/duck/Alberta/60/76 (Dk/Alb[H12N5]) strain, and the classic swine virus A/swine/Wisconsin/1/67 (Sw/Wis[H1N1]) strain (Table 1). We used a recombinant version of the influenza A/Panama/2007/1999 strain generated by reverse genetics, which will be described elsewhere. The human virus strains were grown on MDCK cells, whereas the duck and swine isolates were propagated in 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Virus stocks were aliquoted, stored at \u201380\u00b0C and titrated on MDCK cells by a plaque assay. All experiments with H5N1 virus were performed in a biosafety level 3 containment laboratory approved by local authorities for work with these viruses.\n",

The lung specimens mainly consisted of complex alveolar tissue derived from the lower pulmonary lobe (Figure 1A). Infection of the explants with the prototypic seasonal Pan/99(H3N2) virus resulted in productive infection with a strong increase in the number of infectious viral particles in the culture supernatant (Figure 1B). The viability of the specimens remained stable for up to 96 hours as judged by constantly low values for released lactate dehydrogenase (data not shown). Hence, infections of explants from the same donor at 0 hours or 1 day later resulted in only minor differences between the viral growth curves (Figure 1B). The addition of trypsin did not increase virus titers, suggesting that protease activity required for cleavage activation of the viral HA was preserved in the lung explants (data not shown).\n",

Similarly, the seasonal and pandemic H1N1 viruses NC/99(H1N1) and Bay/09(H1N1pdm) replicated to comparable titers, while the growth of the classic swine influenza virus Sw/Wis(H1N1) was significantly attenuated (Figure 1D). The observed differences were unlikely the result of a specific receptor preference because lectin histochemical analysis identified both \u03b1-2,3SA and \u03b1-2,6SA receptor determinants in the alveolar compartment (Supplementary Figure 1), in confirmation of a previous report [9]. Overall, these data demonstrated substantial differences in the growth capacities of human and animal influenza A viruses in human lung tissue. Interestingly, there appeared to be a correlation between the ability of the different influenza A viruses to replicate in the explants and their capacity to cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans.",

To identify possible differences between the human and animal virus strains on a cellular level, we infected human lung explants and performed immunohistochemical analyses (Figure 2). Despite poor propagation in human lung tissue, viral antigen was detected in cells infected with low-pathogenicity avian and classic swine virus at similar rates. Interestingly, costaining of virion antigens and the type II marker surfactant protein C precursor [25] revealed that the vast majority of cells infected with Sw/Wis(H1N1), Dk/Alb(H12N5), Pan/99(H3N2), NC/99(H1N1), Thai/04(H5N1), or Bay/09(H1N1pdm) virus represented type II pneumocytes (Figure 2A and 2B). Conversely, we failed to detect any of these viruses in type I pneumocytes, as judged by costaining for the marker antigens EMP2 (Figure 3) and caveolin 1 (data not shown), although lectin staining confirmed the presence of receptors for human and avian strains on both pneumocyte types (Figure 3C). Double staining of viral antigen and the CD68 marker also detected influenza virus antigen\u2013positive alveolar macrophages for all viruses tested (Supplementary Figure 2). Most likely, this indicated an ongoing infection of macrophages because no influenza A virus\u2013positive cells were detected after incubation with ultraviolet light (UV)\u2013inactivated viruses (data not shown), although it cannot be excluded that parts of the signals were caused by phagocytosed viral antigen. Quantification of the infected cell types on tissue cross sections showed that alveolar macrophages accounted only for 4%\u201311% of the antigen-positive cells, whereas 89%\u201396% were type II pneumocytes, depending on the virus strain (Figure 4).\n",

Thus, we determined the induction of cytokines in the lung tissue by HPAIV and other viruses of the panel. Infection of human lung tissue with the seasonal NC/99(H1N1) and Pan/99(H3N2) viruses and with the pandemic Bay/09(H1N1pdm) virus provoked only very weak secretions of IP-10, MIP-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 6). In contrast, the Thai/04(H5N1) virus elicited a strong induction of these cytokines and chemokines. Surprisingly, low-pathogenicity avian virus Dk/Alb(H12N5) also provoked a pronounced induction of these cytokines and chemokines, reaching 3\u201313-fold higher levels than were observed for the seasonal NC/99(H1N1). This upregulation hardly occurred when the tissue was probed with UV-inactivated virus or allantoic fluid, indicating that cytokine induction was triggered by viral infection (Supplementary Figure 3). The classic swine virus Sw/Wis(H1N1) caused a weak cytokine response, with only IP-10 reaching levels significantly higher than for the seasonal viruses. In conclusion, these findings indicate that avian influenza viruses with low pathogenicity and those with high pathogenicity induce a considerably stronger cytokine response in the alveolar tissue than human-adapted viruses, even in the absence of recruited immune cells.\n",

Hence, mutations in the viral polymerase and the HA molecule of avian influenza viruses are known to promote adaptation to a mammalian host [6].

The suitability of the lung organ cultures for our study was supported by the findings that HPAIV-H5N1 and human-adapted seasonal and pandemic viruses propagated efficiently. In contrast, low-pathogenicity avian and classic swine viruses replicated only poorly, which may reflect the strong attenuation of most avian viruses in humans and the rare detection of human patients with swine influenza virus infection [5, 33].",

In fact, differences in the target cell type correlated with the magnitudes in replication of avian and human influenza A viruses in reconstituted human tracheobronchial epithelium [35, 36]. Similarly, it had been proposed that preferential infection of type II pneumocytes by H5N1 viruses in human lung may explain high viral loads and strong pathologic responses in patients and nonhuman primates [10, 11, 23]. This suggestion was based on the fast metabolism of this cell type and its essential roles in maintaining alveolar surface tension and the initiation of repair processes [12, 27, 37]. However, the immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses of explanted lung tissues in essence debilitated this hypothesis as HPAIV-H5N1 and all other examined viruses showed a strong preference to infect type II pneumocytes, although they varied up to several orders of magnitude in their progeny titers. These results confirm and extend previous reports on the detection of viral antigen from pandemic and seasonal strains in type II pneumocytes, which however, did not address the production of infectious virus particles in this cell type [38, 39]. We found it intriguing that at least one other important respiratory viral pathogen, SARS coronavirus, has evolved to preferentially replicate in type II pneumocytes although it clearly uses a different receptor for cell entry than influenza viruses [40\u201342]. This indicates that type II pneumocytes are highly susceptible to viral infections and this might be important to consider in the development of future antiviral therapies.",

This finding is consistent with recent reports showing that isolated alveolar macrophages are susceptible to infection with human and avian influenza viruses [44, 45]. Nevertheless, macrophages constituted only a very minor fraction of all infected cells, and they most likely did not contribute a great extent to virus growth but may well have contributed to the production of cytokines. The seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 viruses induced only a moderate cytokine response, indicating that these viruses avoid or suppress a vigorous activation in epithelial lung tissue [46]. Also, the pandemic H1N1-2009 virus provoked a weak cytokine response, which confirms previous reports involving infected human macrophages, dendritic cells, and primary alveolar cells [47, 48]. The low level of cytokine induction may have contributed to the successful propagation and rapid spread of the H1N1-pdm virus in humans. H5N1 virus replicated at least as well as seasonal H3N2 virus but induced strong cytokine responses in resident alveolar cells in human lung explants. Because recruited immune cells are absent in the ex vivo infection model, it is likely that the pronounced cytokine induction by HPAIV-H5N1 in infected patients [16] is already initiated at the level of the infected alveolar cells.",

            "text": "Interestingly, low-pathogenicity avian virus also triggered a strong cytokine response in lung explants despite poor viral growth. This finding indicates that this virus either produces a high amount of RNA that leads to enhanced activation of intracellular receptors controlling cytokine induction or that the ligation of avian receptor determinants provides a signal for the expression of cytokine genes. The latter possibility would be in line with recent findings demonstrating equal or even higher concentrations of MIP-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs of mice infected with low-pathogenicity avian H5N1 virus as compared to HPAIV-H5N1 virus [22]. Furthermore, Ramos et al recently showed that an avian receptor binding preference contributes to strong cytokine induction in various human cells, but the precise reasons for that are currently unclear [49]. The classic swine virus triggered in comparison only low levels of cytokine secretion. Thus, poor growth of an animal influenza virus in human lung is not necessarily caused by a strong cytokine induction but may involve other viral and/or cellular factors.",

Whether the permissiveness of human lung tissue for a given influenza virus depends on its inherent replicative properties in type II pneumocytes, a specific adaptation to withstand the induced innate responses [50], or a combination thereof remains to be determined. One should keep in mind that no ex vivo or animal model can completely reproduce the complex structures and immunological responses in the human respiratory tract. Nevertheless, the experimental findings obtained in this study closely mirror clinical and pathological observations and will therefore allow more detailed investigations regarding factors of species adaptation, innate immune responses, and therapeutic interventions in future analyses.",
