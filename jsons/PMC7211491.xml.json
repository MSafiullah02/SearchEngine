Given that physical bookstores may be forced to close temporarily and that consumers may not want to travel to such brick-and-mortar stores because of health concerns, the demand for online book shopping will expectedly rise quickly in the short term. There is therefore an urgent need for publishers and booksellers to develop and reinforce their presence online. These stakeholders also need to develop effective marketing strategies aiming at promoting consumer purchase behavior and understanding consumer motivations for online book shopping is a prerequisite.",

A notable study conducted by Laing and Royle [1] reveals that good prices, product range, convenience and speed delivery are major qualities of consumer experience associated with online book shopping. Hsiao [2] reports that consumers purchase book online to save travel time and cost. Nguyen et al. [3] assert that online shoppers pay attention to the following key attributes of online bookstores: website design, merchandise, order fulfillment, communication, promotion, security and privacy. However, none of these studies has explicitly investigated consumer motivations for purchasing books online. Motivations refer to \u201cthe inner reasons or driving forces behind human actions that drive consumers to address real needs\u201d [4]. Motivations for shopping online include utilitarian and hedonic ones [5]. Simply put, utilitarian motivation is concerned with expectations and consequences [6], while hedonic motivation is related to shopping enjoyment [7]. Accordingly, consumers may be motivated to engage in online shopping because of its usefulness and excitement.",

Such factors can either trigger or reduce the frequency of online shopping [9]. Nevertheless, research into situational influences on online book purchasing is scarce.

It also focuses on Vietnam which represents a potential market opportunity for online retailers including e-bookstores [3, 10, 11]. Despite the current dominance of brick-and-mortar bookstores, online bookselling is rising in Vietnam. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, major online booksellers such as fahasa.com, vinabook.com and bookbuy.vn have sought to attract more customers to their sites. For instance, fahasa.com has introduced special combos and collections such as \u201cReading with your kids during the COVID-19 outbreak\u201d. It has also offered FAHASA deals, flash sale and discounts for payment using VISA card. The findings of this study will extend current knowledge about online book shopping in emerging markets like Vietnam, and also provide marketing implications for publishers and online booksellers operating in this market.",

To measure consumer intention to buy books online, three items were adapted from Nguyen et al. [11] and San Mart\u00edn and Herrero [14]. Situational influences of the COVID-19 were measured with five items developed by the researchers. All the items were measured by a seven-point Likert scale, anchored by (1) \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d and (7) \u201cStrongly agree\u201d.

That is, hedonic motivation, as compared to utilitarian motivation and situational influence, is less important in predicting online purchase intention.
