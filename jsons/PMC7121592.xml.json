Raising transgenic animals and plants has fueled ethical concerns, and the scientists have faced a lot of resistance where genetically modified crop plants or reproductive cloning research of human beings is involved. Thus, biosafety and bioethics are continuously being expanded to combine the rationale of ever-increasing scientific knowledge in biotechnology that are often in conflict with the long-standing social and moral value system of our society.",

For example, GM foods have low support in Europe and India. With the passing years, there is further decline in public support, probably due to media focus and the visible debates on GM crops for fear of their long-term effects and unknown risks and environmental safety issues. The controversies from nongovernment organizations (NGOs), scientists, and media have led to a negative impact on the GM crops. GM crop usage has been controversial with fears being expressed on Flavr Savr tomato and many others. GM food again went into controversy due to labeling issues. The Bt crops were challenged with the development of resistance in insects. So-called terminator technology and a gene use restriction technology (GURT) met with a lot of resistance due to introduction of negative traits of sterility in the seeds and never came to the market.",

Though both the terms are not scientifically accurate, they are widely used. In somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the nucleus from the somatic cell is transferred into the enucleated egg. The resulting embryo can either be implanted into a mother or surrogate mother for development (the cloned sheep Dolly was the outcome of SCNT) or the embryo can be used for research purposes [7]. Implantation of embryo for gestation is referred as reproductive cloning, whereas in therapeutic cloning embryo is harvested forembryonic stem cells [16]. The stem cells obtained from embryo are embryonic stem cells, which can be induced to form different cells [8, 25].People and scientific community in favor of human cloning say that it can combat infertility and very useful for therapeutic purposes.Many people are against the creation and usage of embryo for research purposes; some are concerned about the risks like ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in egg donors.Many more object to the destruction of embryos as they represent the initial phase of human life thus considered morally equivalent to humans; therefore, they consider therapeutic cloning at par to reproductive cloning.Human reproductive cloning is unacceptable and unethical for many scientists and philosophers [9]. Most of the countries have banned all kinds of human cloning.In the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (UDHGHR) by UNESCO in 1997, it says that the \u201cPractices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted.\u201dThe resolution in this line was also passed by the WHO saying that human reproductive cloning is against human dignity and urged member states to prohibit it. Likewise The Council of Europe\u2019s Additional Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (1998), The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000) prohibits the reproductive cloning of human beings (Article 3).The potential and the power of the technology require caution when we ourselves are the objects of biotechnology [35].\n",

Their goal is to extend human life, enhance the brain and its capacities, delay aging, and improve physical conditions (so-called superhumans). Attempting technological augmentation on the normal human function [17, 36] can take us far away from our own species to \u201csuperhuman\u201d function. Thus, technological interventions can shift us from what we called as Homo sapiens to \u201csuperhuman\u201d Homo sapiens technologicus\u2014a species that uses, fuses, and integrates technology to enhance its own function [46, 47].",
