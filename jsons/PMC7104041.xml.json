The newly prepared Schiff base and its metal complexes showed a higher effect on E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and S. aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) (Mohamed et al., 2010). It is known that the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is surrounded by an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides. The synthesized Schiff base and its metal complexes seem to be able to combine with the lipophilic layer in order to enhance the membrane permeability of the Gram-negative bacteria. The lipid membrane surrounding the cell favours the passage of only lipid soluble materials; thus the lipophilicity is an important factor that controls the antimicrobial activity. Also the increase in lipophilicity enhances the penetration of Schiff base and its metal complexes into the lipid membranes and thus restricts further growth of the organism (Tumer et al., 1999, Imran et al., 2007, Raman et al., 2009). The Schiff base and its metal complexes are more toxic on S. aureus than on E. coli, probably due to the sulphonic OH, OCH3, S and CH3CH2CH groups, which might interact with the double membrane (Mohamed et al., 2010). This activity is related to the nature and structure of the complexes (Fig. 2\n).",

The antibacterial activity has been explained on the basis of chelation theory. Also, the results indicated that tested complexes were more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. It may be concluded that antibacterial activity of the compounds is related to cell wall structure of the bacteria. It is possible because the cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria and some antibiotics are able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan (El-Sherif and Eldebss, 2011) (Fig. 3\n).",

The higher activity of the metal complexes may be owing to the effect of metal ions on the normal cell membrane. Metal chelates bear polar and nonpolar properties together; this makes them suitable for permeation to the cells and tissues. In addition, chelation may enhance or suppress the biochemical potential of bioactive organic species (Nair et al., 2012).",

Moreover, the stoichiometry and the stability constants of the prepared complexes have been determined spectrophotometrically using continuous variation and molar ratio methods. The obtained results indicated that the Schiff bases of the amino acids: l-alanine, l-phenylalanine, l-histidine and l-arginine behave as tridentate ligands. The ligands are coordinating with the Cu(II) via azomethine nitrogen, deprotonated carboxylate oxygen and phenolic oxygen. While in the case of L-aspartic, the ligand acts as tetradentate due to the coordination of the second carboxylate group. Based on the studies of magnetic moments and electronic spectra, a square planar geometry has been proposed for all Cu(II) complexes except bromosalicylaldehydine aspartate complex which has a distorted tetrahedral structure. The representative Schiff bases and their Cu(II) complexes were tested in vitro for their antibacterial activity against two Gram-Positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and B. cereus) and one Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa). All the complexes showed activity against the organisms more than the free Schiff base ligands and the activity increases with the increase in concentration of test solution containing the new complexes. The activity data show that the metal complexes have a promising biological activity comparable with the parent Schiff base ligand against bacterial species (Abu-Dief and Nassr, 2015).",

The ligands presented here and their transition metal complexes gave better results against the growth of fungi. It is found that the activity increases upon coordination. The increased activity of the metal chelates can be explained on the basis of chelation theory (Raman et al., 2001, Prashanthi et al., 2008). The orbital of each metal ion is made so as to overlap with the ligand orbital. Increased activity enhances the lipophilicity of complexes due to delocalization of pi-electrons in the chelate ring (Srivastava, 1981). In some cases increased lipophilicity leads to breakdown of the permeability barrier of the cell (Gupta et al., 1997, Cukurovali et al., 2002). The results of anti-fungal screening, indicate that Cu(II) complexes show more activity than the other complexes. These results may be due to higher stability constant of the Cu(II) complexes than the other complexes.",

The antifungal experimental results of the compounds were compared with the standard antifungal drug (Miconazole) at the same concentration. All the metal complexes exhibited greater antifungal activity against Aspergillus sp. However, they show slightly lesser activity against Rhizoctonia sp. than standard drug Miconazole. The Cr(III) and Fe(III) complexes are more effective against Penicillium sp. than the standard drug. From the data it has been also observed that the activity depends upon the type of metal ion and varies in the following order of the metal ion: Cr > Fe > Mn (Kumar et al., 2012).",

Furthermore, the activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 was part of the Cu (II) complex-induced apoptosis, which confirmed the involvement of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.

The synthetic compounds were screened for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities. Carrageen an-induced paw oedema (CIPO) and histamine induced paw oedema (HIPO) methods were used to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of commercial sample of 4APZ and its synthesized Schiff bases in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity was in the order of 4APZAB > 4APZBB > 4APZCB > 4APZVn and all the test compounds exhibited considerable dose dependent inhibition of the paw oedema. The effect of the compounds on membrane stabilization was also determined which showed that compounds 4APZ (120 and 240 mg/kg doses), 4APZAB (160 mg/kg) and 4APZVn (600 mg/kg) produced highly significant inhibition (P < 0.001) of hypotonicity-induced haemolysis. Further, it was also observed that 4APZ (120 and 240 mg/kg doses), 4APZBB (500 mg/kg) and APZCB (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg dose) produced highly significant inhibition (P < 0.001) of albumin denaturation; a consistent dose dependent anti-inflammatory effect of test compounds as compared to the standard drug. Analgesic activity of the compounds was investigated by formalin-induced paw licking (FIPL) and acetic acid-induced writhing (AIW) methods in mice. It was observed that 4APZ (240 mg/kg), 4APZAB (160 mg/kg), 4APZBB (500 mg/kg), 4APZCB (600 mg/kg) and 4APZVn (600 mg/kg) showed analgesic effect with highly significant (P < 0.001) reduction of paw licking and writhing activity in the treated mice. The order of analgesic effect of the compounds was 4APZAB > 4APZBB > 4APZVn > 4APZCB. Moreover, phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time (PIST) in mice was also studied but only 600 mg/kg of 4APZVn significantly increased the duration of induced sleep which also suggested its sedative property. Brewer's yeast was used to induce fever in rabbits and analyzed the compounds for their antipyretic activity. Different doses of 4APZ for different time durations (240 mg/kg-after 1 h, 120 and 240 mg/kg doses-after 2 h) produced highly significant (P < 0.001) inhibition of hyperpyrexia.

In Nature, an equivalent role is assumed by ligninolytic enzymes such as lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases and laccases. The development of low molecular weight manganese peroxidase mimics may achieve environmentally-safe bleaching catalysts for the industry. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of six manganese(III) complexes 1\u20136, incorporating dianionic hexadentate Schiff base ligands (H2L1\u2013H2L4) and different anions. Complex 4, Mn2L22(H2O)2(DCA)2 was crystallographically characterized. Complexes 1\u20134 behave as more efficient mimics of peroxidase in contrast to 5\u20136. We have studied the use of these complexes as catalysts for the degradation of the lignin model compound veratryl alcohol. The biomimetic catalysts were used in conjunction with chlorine-free inexpensive co-oxidants as dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide. Yields up to 30% of veratryl alcohol conversion to veratraldehyde have been achieved at room temperature in presence of air flow using 0.5% of catalyst (Gonz\u00e1lez-Riopedre et al., 2013) (Fig. 7\n).",

The catalyst was found to be highly efficient and showed higher catalytic reactivity than the corresponding homogeneous analogues with added benefits of facile recovery and recycling of the heterogeneous catalyst. The POSS-bridged oxo-molybdenum Schiff base complex was successfully reused for four runs without significant loss in activity. The unique three dimensional network catalyst structure and the hydrophobic properties of the POSS units in the catalyst are revealed to be responsible for the catalyst's excellent performance in epoxidation reactions (Fig. 8\n).",

Cu(II) Schiff base complex is found to be an effective catalyst for the condensation reaction of indole with aldehydes using ethanol as the solvent. An aldehyde was activated by the catalyst and then carried out an electrophilic substitution at C-3 of an indole. After ring-opening reaction, the intermediate was served as an electrophile to attack a second molecule of indole, the target products were formed after loss of water. The products were obtained in high yields (up to 98%). The solution diluted with saturated sodium chloride solution and extracted with ethyl acetate, dried by magnesium sulphate, solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a crude product which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether 1:15). This method offers several advantages such as high yield of product, short reaction time, simple work up procedures and environmental friendly. Further work is in progress to extrapolate the catalytic activity of Schiff base complex to other organic transformation (Yang et al., 2011).",
