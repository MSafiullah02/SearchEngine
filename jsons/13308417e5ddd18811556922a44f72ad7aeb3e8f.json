The necessity of this critical step before analytical identification and diagnosis of viral infections is paramount to screening programs and to identifying and monitoring epidemics and pandemics. With molecular assays rapidly evolving into routine practice, clinical laboratories face several challenges, including presence of small amounts of viral nucleic acids in abundant levels of genomic DNA and total RNA, processing of various sample types, and carry-over of polymerase chain reaction inhibitors, which could significantly affect polymerase chain reaction and microarray results. MagaZorb nucleic acid isolation technology overcomes these challenges and offers a simple and reliable method for isolation of highquality and high-yield nucleic acids. Although the MagaZorb technology is readily adaptable to automated platforms, it is also well suited to laboratories in remote areas of resource-poor countries, because a simple magnet is the only device required to perform the procedure manually.

The need for a fast, reliable, and cost-effective way to purify nucleic acids from a variety of sample types is a reality. Most existing nucleic acid purification techniques are based on the use of silica beads or various membranes [1] [2] [3] . These procedures are tedious, time consuming, and laborious and involve hazardous materials and organic solvents. They often require on-site preparation of ancillary reagents or need additional equipment, such as a centrifuge or vacuum aspiration device. The MagaZorb (Cortex Biochem, re-cently acquired by Promega) nucleic acid isolation system overcomes these limitations and provides highquality and high-yield nucleic acids with speed, ease of use, and reliability. It is also well suited to the existing automated platforms for high-throughput applications.

Maternal antibodies against HIV can cross the placenta and persist in infants for \u044318 months; thus, antibody tests cannot be reliably used to identify HIV infection in infants. The most reliable detection method currently available is the nucleic acid-based assay to detect the presence of HIV nucleic acid in blood samples from infants [12] . Because most of the infected infants reside in remote areas of resource-poor countries, to make the detection service available to these infants, blood is collected on a filter paper (eg, Whatman 903 paper) by finger or toe pricking, dried at room temperature, and packaged in a humidity-proof bag with desiccants to prevent the build-up of humidity, which causes degradation of RNA and DNA in DBS specimens after prolonged storage at \u03ea20\u040aC. These DBS specimens are transported to a central laboratory for processing and detection using PCRbased assays. The most frequently used PCR product in resource-limited countries in Africa and Asia is the qualitative Amplicor DNA Assay (version 1.5; Roche) [12] . Ou et al [4] recently developed a real-time fluorescent RT-PCR assay for HIV-1 detection in infants and young children. This method uses a small disk of 6 mm in diameter from DBS. Total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are extracted using MagaZorb DNA Kit (Cortex Biochem), excluding the RNase treatment step. HIV-1 DNA and RNA are detected using a fluorescent real-time RT-PCR assay with a primer pair to gen-erate an amplicon of \u223c110 base pairs [4] . In this report, a total of 443 DBS samples collected from infants and young children in Uganda ( ) and Cameroon ( ) were examined n p 128 n p 315 and compared with the existing standard protocol using the HIV load assay and the Roche Amplicor DNA assay, with a concordance of 99.2% (127 of 128 children) and 99.4% (313 of 315 children), respectively.
