The patient was on oral azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate without any improvement. She was an ex-smoker and had a medical history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At admission she presented severe respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 55 mmHg, respiratory rate 26 breaths/min) with a need for high-flow oxygen therapy. A lung ultrasound (US) showed diffuse B lines with pleural thickening and small subpleural consolidations. A chest CT scan and nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Laboratory findings, including the SIC score, are reported in Table 1 . Antibiotics were discontinued, and darunavir/cobicistat, hydroxychloroquine and LMWH at a prophylactic dose were started. On day 12 after admission, the patient complained of an ache in her right leg and a sensation of warmth. She denied chest pain and dyspnoea (PaO 2 /FiO 2 >300 mmHg on nasal prong oxygen). Physical examination revealed oedema of the right leg and signs of dehydration. Compression ultrasound (CUS) of the right common femoral vein indicated venous thrombosis (Fig. 1) . Lung US showed multiple bibasal consolidations (Fig. 2) . Echocardiography documented normal ventricular function in the absence of indirect signs of PE. The inferior vena cava had completely collapsed, indicating hypovolemia. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia. Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer (24 131 mg/dl), fibrinogen (674 mg/dl), serum ferritin (765 ng/ml) and troponin I (57 ng/ml) ( Table 1) . As creatinine clearance was \u226430 ml/min, continuous intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin was started with close monitoring of partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient underwent a CT scan of the chest that showed diffuse bilateral consolidations and a crazy-paving pattern (visual CT score 70%) (Fig. 3) . Based on this finding, we introduced systemic corticosteroids. The patient is still recovering at the time of writing. Her clinical condition is progressively improving with complete resolution of acute renal failure after infusion of crystalloid fluids ( Table 1) . She needs only low-flow oxygen therapy. The heparin infusion was switched after 3 days to standard-dose LMWH (enoxaparin). ",

Pointof-care lung US revealed diffuse B lines with bibasal consolidations which were also documented by chest x-ray. A nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Laboratory findings at diagnosis are reported in Table 2 . The patient's medical history was unremarkable, and he did not take any medications. Right bundle branch block (RBB) was detected on ECG. He was treated with darunavir/cobicistat, hydroxychloroquine, LMWH at a prophylactic dose and low-flow nasal prong oxygen. He was discharged after 10 days in good health with no need for oxygen. His SIC score was below 4, so LMWH administration was stopped. However, after 1 week the patient again presented to our ED with complaints of acute chest pain while breathing (SpO 2 97%, PaO 2 /FiO 2 341 mmHg on ambient air), and an ache in his left leg for the last 3 days. He denied previous venous thrombosis or a family history of thrombophilia. The clinically suspected DVT was confirmed by CUS with no compressibility of the left popliteal vein. Echocardiography was normal. Lung US showed focal B lines and left basal consolidation with slight pleural effusion (Fig. 4) . ECG results were unchanged (NSR, RBBB). CT pulmonary angiography documented left subsegmental PE with diffuse ground-glass opacity and a crazy-paving pattern (visual CT score 5%) (Fig. 5) . Laboratory findings are reported in Table 2 . Interestingly, the SIC score was normal [3] . Another nasopharyngeal swab was taken and showed low-positive results. Fondaparinux was immediately started at a high dose and switched to a twice daily regimen of dabigatran after 5 days. The patient was discharged without sequelae on day 6. ",

COVID-19 patients frequently complain of severe asthenia, fatigue and consequent inactivity, even at the beginning of the infection. In addition, risk factors for VTE include hypoxia and sepsis [9] , which are two common features of COVID-19. Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia [8] , but no data have been reported in the literature for the different stages of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, D-dimer is not a useful marker for diagnosing VTE in COVID-19, because it is generally increased, particularly in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and is associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death [1] . Based on all this evidence, if there are clinical signs and/or suspicion of VTE, CUS and echocardiography should always be [Q5]Both our patients seemed to be at risk of VTE even in the absence of hypoxaemia and severe respiratory failure, and it is clear VTE can increase the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Accurate knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology will be important in predicting and preventing VTE, and further studies are necessary to evaluate whether the SIC score can guide the decision to initiate anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19. Based on our experience, we believe that LMWH therapy at a prophylactic dose should be carefully considered in all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for a longer period than required for clinical resolution of the disease.",
