            "text": "The entry of enveloped viruses into cells requires the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, driven by conformational changes in viral glycoproteins. Structural studies have defined three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins. Despite their different structural organizations, all seem to have a common mechanism of action that generates the same lipid organizations during the fusion pathway. In this chapter, the structures of the best characterized viral fusion glycoproteins of the three classes will be presented. We will focus on the interactions between fusion glycoproteins and membranes, presenting evidences for the existence of an extended intermediate conformation exposing the fusion peptides at the top of the molecule. We will show that the fusion peptides cannot penetrate deeply inside the membrane and that their rather interfacial interaction with the lipid bilayer is probably sufficient to initiate the fusion mechanism by facilitating the formation of stalk precursors. We will also review the regulatory mechanisms that allow fusion to be triggered at the right time and right place. Finally, many studies have demonstrated that fusion involves the cooperative action of a large number of fusion glycoproteins. We will discuss new data that have shown that the glycoproteins located outside the contact zone between virions and liposomes reorganize into regular arrays that have been proposed to drive the late stages of the fusion reaction.",

            "text": "Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires binding of the virus to one or more receptors present at the cell surface, followed by fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane. These steps are mediated by virally encoded glycoproteins that promote both receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The membrane fusion process involves large structural rearrangements of the fusogenic glycoproteins upon interaction with specific triggers (e.g., low pH environment and cellular receptors). These conformational changes result in the exposure of hydrophobic motifs (the so-called fusion peptides or fusion loops) that then interact with one or both of the participating membranes, resulting in their destabilization and merger. Triggering of the conformational change in the absence of a target membrane leads to inactivation of the fusion properties of the fusogenic glycoprotein.",

However, experimental data suggest that the membrane fusion pathway is very similar for all the enveloped viruses studied so far whatever the organization of their fusion machinery (Chernomordik et al., 1998, Chernomordik et al., 1997, Gaudin, 2000, Zaitseva et al., 2005). It is generally assumed that fusion proceeds via the formation of an intermediate stalk that is a local lipidic connection between the outer leaflets of the fusing membranes. Radial expansion of the stalk would induce the formation of a transient hemifusion diaphragm (i.e., a local bilayer made by the two initial inner leaflets) in which the formation of a pore and its enlargement would lead to complete fusion (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2005, Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008, Chernomordik et al., 1995). Even if fusion of two lipid bilayers is thermodynamically favorable, there are energetic barriers that have to be overcome at different steps of the process, the highest one being apparently encountered during the expansion of the initial fusion pore (Cohen & Melikyan, 2004). It has been proposed that the energy released during the favorable fusogenic structural transition is used to overcome these different barriers (Carr et al., 1997, Harrison, 2008).",

Low pH treatment results in the loss of HA1\u2013HA2 interactions and dissociation of the HA1\u2013HA1 interface stabilizing the prefusion structure. After the transition, the structure of HA1 is not significantly modified as it is still able to bind the viral receptor (Sauter et al., 1992) and is still recognized by monoclonal antibodies (Bizebard et al., 1995). In fact, HA low-pH-induced conformational change is essentially a dramatic refolding of HA2 (Figure 1A, middle). During this refolding, a long loop in native HA2 converts to a helix, resulting in length increase of the central coiled coil at its N-terminal end. This movement translocates the fusion peptide toward the head of the molecule, that is, toward the target membrane. At this stage, HA is in an extended intermediate conformation (Figure 1A, right). The structural transition is completed by a relocation of the carboxyterminal membrane anchor through a foldback mechanism to the amino-terminal end of the rod-shaped molecule. This results in the so-called hairpin conformation in which the transmembrane segment and the fusion peptide are in close proximity at the same end of the elongated molecule (Figure 1A, middle).",

This motif has thus served to define the class I of fusion proteins. Most of the class I fusion proteins have also an internal, frequently furin-like, cleavage site located upstream a stretch of about 20 hydrophobic amino acids that will constitute the fusion peptide. Class I signature is the presence of a first heptad repeat region (named HRA or HR1) that is immediately downstream the fusion peptide and forms the central trimeric coiled coil. It is often (but not always) accompanied by a second one (named HRB or HR2) located in the C-terminal part of the ectodomain that constitutes the helices positioned, in an antiparallel manner, in the groove of the central coiled coil (Figure 1B).",

This activation can be by direct interactions (HIV env) (Melikyan, 2008) or indirectly through a viral attachment protein (paramyxovirus F) (Lamb & Jardetzky, 2007). Finally, although Ebola virus enters cell by the endocytic pathway, this probably reflects a need for glycoprotein GP processing by lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsins, to trigger GP-mediated fusion, rather than simply low pH itself (Chandran et al., 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006).",

F is a trimer that is proteolytically cleaved to liberate the N terminus of the fusion peptide (Lamb & Jardetzky, 2007). It is worth noting that in absence of its transmembrane segment, soluble F ectodomain can spontaneously convert into its postfusion conformation even in absence of the cleavage that primes the full-length glycoprotein for subsequent conformational change (Yin et al., 2005). Thus, to replace the missing transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail and to stabilize the prefusion form, the trimeric GCN4 derivative was placed in register with C-terminal HRB of the secreted PIV5 F protein ectodomain (Yin et al., 2006).",

This indicated that the genes encoding these proteins were derived from a common ancestor. The alphaviruses and flaviviruses are members of the Togaviridae and Flaviviridae families, respectively, and other fusion proteins of viruses from these families, including West Nile virus E (Kanai et al., 2006, Nybakken et al., 2006), dengue virus E (Modis, Ogata, Clements, & Harrison, 2003), and hepatitis C virus E2 (Krey et al., 2010), have been demonstrated to belong to class II.

This heterodimeric interaction is important for the correct folding and transport of the fusion protein (Sanchez-San Martin, Liu, & Kielian, 2009). The chaperone protein is cleaved by the cellular protease furin late in the secretory pathway (Stadler et al., 1997, Zhang et al., 2003a). The p62 is cleaved into E2 and E3 (Salminen et al., 1992, Wahlberg et al., 1989) and prM is cleaved into pr peptide and M protein (Heinz et al., 1994). This cleavage is crucial as it primes the protein, which is then in a metastable conformation, for subsequent low-pH-induced conformational change (Sanchez-San Martin, Liu, & Kielian, 2009). In their prefusion state anchored in the viral membrane, class II fusion proteins are organized following the icosahedral symmetry (Kuhn et al., 2002, Lescar et al., 2001).",

First, the alphavirus E2\u2013E1 heterodimers or the flavivirus E\u2013E homodimers dissociate and then reassociate to form E1 or E homotrimers (Figure 2A). The conformational change is less impressive than that observed for HA or for paramyxovirus F protein as there is essentially no change in secondary structure. Nevertheless, the interactions between the domains constituting the protomer are markedly different in the pre- and postfusion conformations. Particularly, domain III, which is connected to the C-terminal part of the molecule, moves by about 35 \u00c5 toward the fusion loop (Figure 2B). The movement of domain III redirects the polypeptide chain, so that the transmembrane segment is located near the fusion loop region in the postfusion trimeric form. Despite the different architecture of the proteins, the postfusion structure is thus reminiscent of the postfusion hairpin structure of class I fusion proteins.",

In the absence of a membrane, soluble E ectodomain dimers dissociate at low pH but redimerize if the pH is returned to neutral (Stiasny, Allison, Marchler-Bauer, Kunz, & Heinz, 1996). Furthermore, several class II fusion proteins require the presence of specific lipids in the target membrane to achieve membrane fusion. SFV and Sindbis virus-induced fusion is strictly dependent on the presence of both cholesterol (Kielian & Helenius, 1984) and sphingolipids (Nieva et al., 1994, Smit et al., 1999). Cholesterol does not seem to be absolutely required for flavivirus-induced membrane fusion (Umashankar et al., 2008) although its presence may facilitate the process for the hepatitis C virus glycoprotein (Lavillette et al., 2006) and strongly promotes West Nile virus fusion activity (Moesker, Rodenhuis-Zybert, Meijerhof, Wilschut, & Smit, 2010). Finally, effective dengue virus fusion to plasma and intracellular membranes, as well as to protein-free liposomes, requires the target membrane to contain anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidylserine (Zaitseva, Yang, Melikov, Pourmal, & Chernomordik, 2010).",

This revealed an unanticipated homology between the two proteins that belong to a negative-strand RNA and a DNA virus, respectively, and for which no sequence similarity was previously identified. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) gB (Backovic, Longnecker, & Jardetzky, 2009) and baculovirus gp64 (Kadlec, Loureiro, Abrescia, Stuart, & Jones, 2008), of which the structures were further determined, have been also demonstrated to belong to this new class (Figure 3B). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of G proteins from animal rhabdoviruses belonging to different genera also reveals that all of them share the same fold (Roche et al., 2006).

They are nonstructural proteins and thus are not involved in viral entry. They promote only syncytia formation. The small size and the lack of any homologues in previously characterized membrane fusion proteins indicate that the FAST proteins of reovirus represent a new class of membrane fusion proteins. Within the ectodomain of FAST proteins, an 11-residue sequence of apolar residues, termed the hydrophobic patch (HP), flanked by two highly conserved cysteines that form a disulfide bridge and create a cystine loop, constitutes a new class of fusion peptide (Barry, Key, Haddad, & Duncan, 2010). Remarkably, membrane curvature agents that inhibit hemifusion or promote pore formation mediated by other fusion proteins have no effect on FAST-induced cell\u2013cell fusion, indicating that FAST-mediated fusion reaction may somehow differ from other virus-induced fusion reactions (Clancy, Barry, Ciechonska, & Duncan, 2010).",

As a consequence, they have a pK\na that is much higher in the postfusion than in the prefusion conformation.

The cleavage of this accompanying protein is required to promote viral fusion under biological conditions. The recent structure of the immature dengue virus at low pH (Yu et al., 2008) has explained how this virus, which buds into the ER, avoids undesirable fusion in the acidic compartments of the Golgi. Immature particles bud into ER as spiky virions with 60 icosahedrally arranged protrusions, each consisting of a trimer of prM\u2013E heterodimers (Y. Zhang et al., 2003b). The atomic structure of dengue virus prM\u2013E heterodimer has been determined (Figure 2C) and fits well into the cryo-electron microscopy density of immature virus (Li et al., 2008). The immature particles are transported into the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where the low pH environment induces a conformational change in the virion, resulting in particles having a much smoother surface with E proteins arranged in a herringbone pattern. This structural transition exposes the furin cleavage site, and proteolysis of prM into pr peptide and M takes place in the TGN. After cleavage, pr peptide remains stably associated with the virion. The pr peptide stabilizes the metastable E dimer, preventing its dissociation and the formation of the postfusion homotrimers. It also covers the fusion loop in E, preventing interaction with host cell membranes. In fact, the dissociation of pr from the virion is pH dependent and pr dissociates only when the virion is released into the slightly alkaline extracellular medium. This definitively primes the metastable E dimer for subsequent low-pH-induced fusogenic conformational change.",

Tyrosines and tryptophans are residues that often position themselves at the interface between the fatty acid chains and the polar head group layers of lipids (Wimley & White, 1992). Such an interfacial interaction involving only a few residues cannot create a strong point of anchoring that can be used to pull the target membrane toward the viral one. Most probably, by perturbating the outer leaflet of the target bilayer, it facilitates the formation of point-like protrusions (Campelo, McMahon, & Kozlov, 2008) that have been proposed to be stalk precursors (Efrat, Chernomordik, & Kozlov, 2007). In addition, membrane deformation is probably facilitated by the large number of glycoproteins at the viral surface and their oligomeric status, allowing multiple fusion loops to interact with the external leaflet of the target bilayer.",

At both pH 7.4 and 5, the domain is a kinked, predominantly helical amphipathic structure. Nevertheless, there are slight differences between both structures that may explain a deeper insertion of the fusion domain into the core of the lipid bilayer at low pH. Nevertheless, here again, in the proposed model of insertion, HA fusion peptides do not penetrate deep into the bilayer structure but rather induce local membrane curvature similar to class II and class III fusion loops. Finally, some class I proteins seem to have also internal fusion loops. This is the case for Ebola virus Gp2 whose fusion loop could expose a conserved WIPYF sequence at its tip (Weissenhorn et al., 1998).",

Indeed, peptides corresponding to the HR2 segment can inhibit the fusion process (Furuta et al., 1998, Wild et al., 1994). A similar inhibition has been observed for paramyxoviruses with peptides derived from the carboxyterminal HRB region of F protein (Russell, Jardetzky, & Lamb, 2001). Such inhibitors do not function in the case of influenza HA. This is probably due to the shorter lifetime of HA extended conformation compared to that of gp41 (several minutes) (Melikyan et al., 2000a, Munoz-Barroso et al., 1998).",

This indicates that the postfusion state of G ectodomain is independently able to self-associate into a quasicrystalline array, thereby deforming membranes.

This is hardly reconcilable with network formation. For these viruses, it is possible that membrane tension needed at the late stages of the fusion process to drive the enlargement of the initial fusion pore is generated by cellular proteins in response to signalization induced by env binding to coreceptors. Interestingly, recent data revealed that dynamin is required for efficient HIV-1 fusion (Miyauchi, Kim, Latinovic, Morozov, & Melikyan, 2009). The authors have proposed that the ability of dynamin to regulate actin remodeling and associate with membrane-bending proteins (Kruchten & McNiven, 2006) could provide a driving force for initial pore expansion.",

The receptor binding domain (HA1) subunits are colored in grey and the HA2 fusion proteins are colored in blue and red, the fusion peptide (FP) is depicted in green. Middle part: Ribbon diagram of HA2 trimer and protomer in the post-fusion conformation (Chen, Skehel, & Wiley, 1999). The central structure formed by HA2 folds into a long trimeric coiled-coil positioning the fusion peptides (absent in the crystalline structure) near the C-terminus of the molecule linked to the transmembrane anchor. Right part: Putative extended intermediate state adopted by HA2 during the structural transition. The cyan loop marked by an asterisk on the neutral HA2 protomer refolds into a helix resulting in a length increase of the central trimeric coiled-coil. This loop-helix transition translocates the fusion peptide toward the target membrane. (B) Trimeric hairpins structures of several class I viral fusion proteins. Side and top views of the trimeric core of the post-fusion structures from class I fusion proteins of four different viruses: hPIV3 F (Yin et al., 2006), Ebola virus GP2 (Weissenhorn et al., 1998), SRAS S2 (Supekar et al., 2004) and HIV gp41 (Weissenhorn et al., 1997). The N-terminal coiled-coil core (HRA or HR1 regions) is colored in blue and the C-terminal domain (HRB and HR2 regions) is in red. In all structures, the trimer-of-hairpins conformation brings the N- and C- termini (corresponding to the position of the fusion peptides and transmembrane domains) into close proximity. (C) Paramyxovirus F structures. Pre-fusion structure of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) F (left part) and post-fusion structure of human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV3) F (right part) (Yin et al., 2005, Yin et al., 2006). For each conformation, trimer and protomer are presented. Domains I (DI), II (DII) and III (DIII), heptad repeats A (HRA) and B (HRB) are shown, hydrophobic fusion peptides (FP) are in green. The two conformations are related by flipping the fusion peptide and the C-terminal domain around a block made of DI and DII that do not change during the structural transition. HRA segments undergo a major reorganization that projects the hydrophobic fusion peptide toward the target membrane (movement illustrated by the blue arrow 1), then the HRB segments dissociate and turn around the globular head to form the post fusion structure (movement illustrated by red arrow 2).
