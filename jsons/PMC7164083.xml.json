            "text": "Several thylakoid proteins of higher plants undergo reversible light\u2010dependent phosphorylation [1, 2]. These phosphoproteins mainly belong to the photosystem II (PSII) complex, including the heterodimeric reaction center polypeptides D1 and D2, the internal chlorophyll a antenna polypeptide CP43 and the 9 kDa psbH gene product as well as the two major polypeptides of the light\u2010harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding complex (LHCII). Reversible phosphorylation of all these proteins occurs at the N\u2010terminal threonine residue on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane [3, 4]. Additionally, a chill\u2010induced light\u2010dependent phosphorylation of a minor chlorophyll a/b binding protein CP29 has been shown to occur in maize leaves [5]. Reversible phosphorylation of PSII proteins in lower photosynthetic organisms is less well characterized. Phosphorylation of D1, D2 or CP43 in red algae or cyanobacteria has not been reported (for reviews, see [6, 7]), yet the phenomenon has been supposed to be involved in regulatory processes of PSII function [6, 8]. Chlorophyll b\u2010possessing lower eukaryotic organisms, like green algae and mosses, also appear to differ from higher plants with respect to PSII core protein phosphorylation [9, 10]. On the other hand, LHCII polypeptide phosphorylation has been established also for green algae [11, 12, 13].",

Reversible D1 protein phosphorylation of higher plants has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of D1 protein turnover and hence the repair of PSII centers under photoinhibitory conditions [15, 16]. PSII repair cycle also involves a conversion of PSII dimers to monomers [17]. The stability of PSII dimers is possibly controlled by reversible phosphorylation of PSII core proteins thus providing another level of regulation for D1 degradation [18]. Thylakoid protein phosphorylation, however, may not only be involved in a short\u2010term regulation of photosynthetic processes but possibly also has a crucial role in physiological and metabolic signalling within chloroplasts or even in the crosstalk between the chloroplast and the nuclear genomes.",

The main phosphoproteins were identified as P\u2010CP43, P\u2010D2, P\u2010D1 and P\u2010LHCII, with protein\u2010specific antibodies (Fig. 1). Detection of the 9 kDa phosphoprotein was not consistently successful. In pumpkin, nearly complete dephosphorylation of the phosphoproteins took place during the dark period and the level of phosphorylation of all the phosphoproteins increased after a shift to growth light (Fig. 1A). During high\u2010light treatment, the PSII core protein phosphorylation further increased whereas LHCII was almost completely dephosphorylated, as also shown earlier [19]. Fig. 1B depicts in more detail the steady\u2010state phosphorylation pattern of thylakoid proteins in intact rye plants under different irradiance levels. Phosphorylation of D1 increased with increasing light intensity and did not show saturation in the light regime (up to 2000 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121) used in this experiment. Phosphorylation of D2 and CP43 responded to increasing irradiance very similarly to that of the D1 protein. As in pumpkin [19], LHCII showed maximal phosphorylation well below the growth light intensity (300 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121) and then sharply declined as irradiance increased. Interestingly, exposure of rye plants to high irradiance (2000 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121) also resulted in an accumulation of a 33 kDa phosphoprotein in the thylakoid membrane. This polypeptide cross\u2010reacted with a CP29\u2010specific antibody (Fig. 1B) and possibly represents the phosphorylated form of the 29 kDa chlorophyll a/b binding protein [5]. It should be noted that in our gel system the phosphorylated and non\u2010phosphorylated forms of CP29 could not be separated.",

Neither did different irradiance conditions induce any D1 phosphorylation in these species.

In Ceratodon and Marchantia, D2 and CP43 remained phosphorylated also in darkness and at low light, and the phosphorylation level hardly increased with increasing light intensity.

In contrast, no phosphorylated PSII core proteins were detected in the eukaryotic red alga that possesses a phycobilisome antenna instead of LHCII (Fig. 3). It is therefore conceivable that the PSII core protein phosphorylation is associated with the mechanism of light harvesting into PSII and raises a question weather the phosphorylation of LHCII is the origin for PSII core protein phosphorylation. LCHII phosphorylation has apparently evolved first, together with grana stacking, to regulate the distribution of excitation energy between the two photosystems. Grana stacking, although sometimes very irregular in group 2 species, is typical for species with reversible LHCII phosphorylation. Whether the phosphorylation of D2 and CP43 evolved independently of LHCII phosphorylation cannot be answered at the moment. Indisputably, however, the reversible D1 protein phosphorylation is the latest event in thylakoid protein phosphorylation and present exclusively in seed plants, both angiosperms and gymnosperms.",

However, the regulation of LHCII phosphorylation distinctively differs from that of D2 and CP43, as evidenced by the differential response of the phosphorylation of these proteins to increasing light intensity (Fig. 1) and by the phosphorylation studies with electron transport inhibitors and cyt b\n6/f mutants [31, 32]. Therefore it is possible that even three different kinases are involved in reversible phosphorylation of thylakoid proteins in seed plants. Moreover, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of CP29 is possibly distinct from the kinase(s) involved in phosphorylation of other PSII proteins. Despite intense research, none of the thylakoid\u2010associated kinases have yet been isolated and characterized.",

PSII core protein phosphorylation in general has been suggested to stabilize PSII dimers and has also been discussed in terms of the regulation of PSII repair [18].
