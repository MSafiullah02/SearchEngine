            "text": "Background: Many factors can influence the occurrence of neonatal diarrhoea in piglets. Currently, well-known pathogens such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens type C appear to play a minor role in development of disease. Other infectious pathogens may be involved. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of selected infectious pathogens in neonatal piglets with clinical and pathological signs of enteric disease. The association between rotavirus A, Enterococcus hirae, Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens type A/C and diarrhoea was investigated in a case control study on piglet level. The possible role of E. coli virulence factors was investigated in a multistep-procedure using herd-pools of E.coli isolates to screen for their presence. Results: Rotavirus A was detected more often in cases (25%) than in controls (6%) (P < 0.001). The detection rate of Enterococcus hirae, Clostridium difficile and C. perfringens type A positive for beta2 genes was the same in the two groups of piglets. C. perfringens type C was not detected in the study. Investigations on E. coli virulence factors showed a high prevalence of EAST1 toxin genes (55% of tested case piglets were positive) and AIDA-1 adhesin genes (63% of toxin positive case piglets were positive) in case piglets. Conclusions: Detection of rotavirus A was statistically significantly associated with neonatal piglet diarrhoea. An aetiologic role of E. coli carrying virulence factors EAST1 and AIDA-1 needs further investigation as the study points out these two factors as possible causative factors in neonatal diarrhoea. Detection of E.hirae, C.difficile and C. perfringens type A carrying beta 2 genes was not associated with neonatal piglet diarrhoea. However, the study suggested that massive overgrowth by E. hirae could be part of the pathogenesis in some cases of neonatal diarrhoea.",

In many cases, the pattern of disease indicates an infectious aetiology, but no causative agents are identified by traditional laboratory investigations. Previous examinations of neonatal diarrhoea in Danish and Swedish herds suggested that Enterococcus spp., rotavirus A and E. coli carrying EAST1 virulence genes might be of significance [1] [2] [3] . Other studies suggest that Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and C. perfringens type A containing beta2 toxin gene (CPA cpb2) may be relevant to investigate further in relation to neonatal diarrhoea [4] [5] [6] .",

Rotavirus C was not included due to earlier studies indicating a very low prevalence and no association with neonatal diarrhoea in Danish and Swedish herds [1, 7, 8] . As no PED or TGE outbreaks have been described in Denmark, coronaviruses were not investigated. In order to obtain a clear definition of a diarrhoeic case vs. a non-diarrhoeic control we used a combination of clinical and pathological examinations.",

This approach reduced the number of clinically evaluated piglets from 355 initially submitted to 268 piglets finally included as cases and controls based on necropsy findings. The fact that 24% of piglets selected as diarrhoeic cases in the herds were either diagnosed with starvation or as being healthy at necropsy shows that diarrhoeic symptoms do not always reflect an enteric pathological condition. Furthermore, 9% of the piglets selected as healthy controls were diagnosed with enteritis at necropsy emphasizing that it is challenging to select the correct piglets for laboratory confirmation. Further, this might explain a part of the difficulties Table 1 Diagnoses assigned at necropsy in 230 piglets selected as diarrhoeic and 125 piglets selected as non-diarrhoeic by the veterinary practitioners in the herds prior to euthanazia. Single piglets were given one to two diagnoses at necropsy [3, 15] . Out of several infectious agents investigated, only rotavirus A was statistically significantly associated with being a case. Rotavirus A is by many considered ubiquitous in suckling piglets, but previous Danish studies have shown that the prevalence within the first week of life can be very low [16] . Studies focusing on the possible viral aetiology of the newly described phenomenon New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) conclude that viruses do not seem to pose a significant contribution to diarrhoeal symptoms in affected herds [7, 16] . However, these herds (four in Denmark and ten in Sweden) were selected as representative for a new type of diarrhoea not caused by known agents, including rotavirus A [1] . In the present study, we did not focus on NNPDS and did not exclude any herds due to presence of rotavirus A. Instead, we included a large number (60) of different herds in order to get a broader picture of diarrhoeal aetiologies in neonatal pigs. Interestingly, our findings support a recent study in two Danish herds. In that study, examining samples from 132 neonatal piglets, 89% of diarrhoeic piglets vs. 48% of non-diarrhoeic piglets were rotavirus A positive by PCR [2] . Taken together, these results suggest that rotavirus A has an important clinical significance in neonatal piglets, although the prevalence of case herds may be rather low as indicated by the low prevalence (18%) shown in this study.",

Also, antibiotics used as metaphylaxis in some of the herds and the Danish breeding programme for F4 resistant pigs [17] could have an influence on the absence of F4 positive E. coli. STb was the only ETEC-associated toxin gene detected at a relatively high prevalence (19% of herd pools were positive).

Few studies have evaluated the possible role of EAST1 and AIDA-1 in neonatal diarrhoea. A Danish study found that 48% of diarrhoeic vs. 18% of non-diarrhoeic neonatal piglets were positive for EAST1. In one of the investigated herds in this study, ten out of ten diarrhoeic piglets were positive for EAST1 [1] .Vu-Khac et al. [19] . Other studies did not find any association between the detection of EAST1 and diarrhoea [20] [21] [22] . Previous studies on AIDA-1 found a quite low prevalence (3-17%) in isolates from diarrhoeic suckling piglets [20, 21, [23] [24] [25] . Two of these studies included non-diarrhoeic specimens and did not detect AIDA-1 in any of those [20, 21] . The current study provides limited information on the piglet level, as only 45 piglets from toxin and adhesin positive pools were individually tested as cases and controls. However, EAST1 being present in 55% of individually tested case piglets with the majority being positive for AIDA-1 also, supports relevance of further investigation of the role of these virulence factors in neonatal diarrhoea. E. hirae is part of the normal intestinal flora of pigs [26] , but Swedish and Danish studies have suggested a possible relation to neonatal diarrhoea [3, 13] . The Swedish study examined 29 piglets and found that 100% of diarrhoeic piglets vs. none of the non-diarrhoeic control piglets exhibited enteroadherent enterococci in the small intestine when examined by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The Danish study examined 101 piglets and found that 37% of diarrhoeic vs. 14% of non-diarrhoeic specimens had enteroadherent enterococci in the small intestine. The present study did not find any association between the detection of E. hirae in intestinal contents and diarrhoea, but the results indicated that a massive growth of E. hirae might have clinical impact. The massive growth seen in some of the piglets in this study may, however, merely be a reflection of a disturbed microbiota.",

One study demonstrated a (minor) cytotoxic effect of supernatant from porcine CPA cpb2, but also showed that the cytotoxic effect was not related to beta2 toxin [35] . Thus, that study suggests that the potential role of C. perfringens type A in neonatal diarrhoea is not due to its ability to produce beta2 toxin.
