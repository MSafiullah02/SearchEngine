Wild carnivores are susceptible to many of the pathogens carried by domestic dogs and cats and some of these pathogens have caused disease outbreaks and severe population declines in threatened species. The risk of disease spillover from domestic to wild carnivores in South America has not been extensively investigated. This study examined the disease exposure of domestic carnivores living near a protected area in Bolivia. Forty dogs and 14 cats living in three towns on the eastern border of Madidi National Park were sampled. High levels of exposure to canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, Sarcoptes scabiei and Toxoplasma gondii were found among domestic dogs, with similarly high levels of exposure to feline parvovirus, feline calicivirus and T. gondii being found among domestic cats. If contact occurs between domestic and wild carnivores, disease spillover may represent an important risk for the persistence of wild carnivores in the region. Additional research is therefore necessary to determine if wild carnivores living in proximity to these domestic carnivore populations are being exposed to these pathogens. \u2020 All correspondence to: C.

Well-co-ordinated and long-standing domestic dog vaccination programmes in much of North America and Europe have made disease spillover from domestic carnivores to wildlife rare; in fact, in the case of rabies, it is spillover from wildlife into domestic populations that is more of a concern (Rupprecht et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2002) . In the developing world, most of the well-documented occurrences of spillover have been in Africa (Gascoyne et al., 1993; Sillero-Zubiri et al., 1996; Nel et al., 1997; Cleaveland et al., 2000) . This may be an artifact of the fact that many African carnivores inhabit open savannahs where they are easily monitored, or it may be simply an artifact of the lack of studies in other regions. In places where studies have been conducted, the potential for disease spillover has been documented. For instance, Mainka et al. (1994) identified antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) in domestic dogs inhabiting the Wolong Reserve in China, indicating the potential for spillover from dogs to giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and other wild carnivores. Disease studies from Latin America are few, but as the human population there increases, it is likely that spillover events will, or already have, occurred.

Three towns on the eastern border of the MNP/IMA were chosen for sampling on the basis of ease of access for the field researchers and proximity to the park (Fig. 1 ). Madidi is a relatively new park of over 18 000 km 2 in north-western Bolivia. It consists of tropical rainforest and cloud forest habitat. San Buenaventura, which houses the main offices of the park, has a population of about 6200. It is situated on the Rio Beni, directly across the river from Rurrenabaque, a larger town (pop. 7000) with an active tourist industry. Therefore, dogs in San Buenaventura are probably exposed to dogs from Rurrenabaque and other nearby towns and villages. Tumupasa, however, is an isolated village of just under 1000 people, situated about 60 km north-west of San Buenaventura. Ixiamas is about 30 km north-west of Tumupasa; it has a population of about 5600 and has grown rapidly over the last few years. The primary economic activities in the area are subsistence hunting and agriculture. Ixiamas has a commercial dairy farm; dogs from this town might therefore be more likely to be exposed to livestock pathogens. None of the towns (including Rurrenabaque) has a resident veterinarian, although rabies vaccination campaigns are periodically operated by the government.

Although we tried to recruit dogs and cats from all of the neighborhoods in each village, no attempt was made to randomise the subjects. In fact, an effort was made to include hunting dogs, which are the most likely to have contact with wildlife. We went from house to house, discussing our project with the residents and asking for their consent to sample their pets. Dog owners were asked to provide information on age and vaccination status of their animal and to indicate whether the dog was purchased specifically for hunting. Unfortunately, conversations with residents revealed that although some dogs were designated as 'hunting dogs,' categorising dogs by hunting status was not realistic because most dogs not specifically identified as hunting dogs nevertheless participated in hunting activities. Only dogs 5 months of age and older were sampled, to ensure that the antibodies detected were endogenous and not of maternal origin (Greene, 1998b) . Using a muzzle and manual restraint, blood was drawn from the jugular or cephalic vein. Three dogs required 1mg of acepromazine maleate (Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) intramuscularly to facilitate sampling. Cats (Felis catus) are infrequently kept as pets in this area, consequently our sample size was smaller than for dogs. Owners were often unsure of the age of their cats, but all the cats we sampled had adult dentition, indicating that they were at least 6 months of age. All cats required chemical restraint for sampling. Each cat was given an intramuscular injection of 10 mg of a premixed combination of equal parts tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam (Telazol R , Fort Dodge Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA) either alone or with 0.1 mg of acepromazine. On a few occasions, additional ketamine hydrochloride (Ketaset R , Fort Dodge Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA) was administered to effect sufficient immobilisation.

We cannot conclude that these viruses are not present in the domestic cat population, but even if every family owned one cat -highly unlikely given the unpopularity of cats in the region -we can be 95% confident that these viruses are present in less than 20% of the population (Cannon & Roe, 1982) . In addition, the single positive result for FeLV antigen was considered a weak positive, indicating the need for a retest in 3-4 weeks to confirm infection. Because a retest was not possible, we cannot confirm the presence of this virus in this animal. Antibodies to feline panleukopaenia were found in all 14 cats (Table 6 ). This virus is of conservation concern because it can cause clinical disease in felids, procyonids and mustelids and it persists in the environment (Greene, 1998a; Steinel et al., 2000: Table 1 ). Infection with feline calicivirus, a pathogen known to cause disease in wild felids (Sabine & Hyne, 1970; Kadoi et al., 1997) , was also widespread in the cats we sampled. In most cases, this virus causes high morbidity but low mortality in domestic cats (Gaskell & Dawson, 1998) ; however, more virulent strains that cause high mortality do exist (Pedersen et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 698, "end": 718, "text": "(Cannon & Roe, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1210, "text": "(Greene, 1998a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1232, "text": "Steinel et al., 2000:", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1349, "text": "(Sabine & Hyne, 1970;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1369, "text": "Kadoi et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1523, "text": "(Gaskell & Dawson, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1615, "text": "(Pedersen et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1036, "end": 1044, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1240, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A striking result was the high seroprevalence of T. gondii exposure in dogs and the large number of dogs with titres suggestive of active infection (Fig. 2) .

They are probably infected as kittens and may have either partial or complete immunity to reinfection. Both dogs and cats are most probably infected via the ingestion of raw meat, including rodents and other wild mammals. Humans are also commonly exposed by this route, but children may be more at risk for infection by ingestion of contaminated soil (Tenter, Heckeroth & Weiss, 2000) .

Only the serovars hardjo and canicola were recognised in our samples (Table 5) . Dogs are the primary host of canicola, so this serovar is probably endemic in this area (Greene, Miller & Brown, 1998) . The serovar hardjo is most often found in cows and other hoofed animals, including wild bovids. Interestingly, most positive dogs were found in Ixiamas, which has a large dairy farm (Tables 4 & 5) . However, the serovar canicola was found in four out of the five Ixiamas dogs with titres, so the presence of cattle may be coincidental. Two dogs from Ixiamas had titres \u22651600, which is considered suggestive of active or recent infection. The few dogs with positive titres from San Buenaventura and Tumupasa had titres of 100, all to serovar hardjo. Unfortunately, our cross-sectional data are insufficient to document active infection; paired titres separated by 2-3 weeks would be necessary. The low seroprevalence of Leptospira found in domestic cats is probably related to their smaller ranging patterns and their natural dislike of standing water.

The stratified prevalence survey employed here is commonly used to estimate the frequency of infection in a population (Greiner & Gardner, 2000a) . Disadvantages to serology include the possibility of cross-reaction of reagents to antibodies against other agents (false positives) as well as the (less likely) possibility for false negatives. The presence of antibodies is dependent on numerous factors, including the immune status of the host, the timing of the initial infection and the outcome of the infection (Greiner & Gardner, 2000a) . The detection of antibodies is further dependent on the accuracy of the test, the presence of cross-reacting substances in the host, sample handling and proper test execution (Barr, 1996; Greiner & Gardner, 2000a) . Even if the test is carried out correctly, determining what constitutes a positive result may be somewhat arbitrary, since cut-off values often vary between laboratories (Barr, 1996; Greiner & Gardner, 2000b) . The interpretation of a positive test -one in which antibody was detected -varies as well. For example, antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus found in the serum of an adult cat using a Western blot nearly always indicates that the cat is currently infected with the virus (Barr, 1996) . However, antibodies to feline coronavirus found in the serum of a cat by any method indicates that the cat was probably infected by a feline coronavirus, or a related coronavirus, at some point in the past (Barr, 1996) . Neither positive result tells you with certainty if the cat in question is, or will become, clinically ill, nor does it tell you which viral strain infected the cat or if that strain was particularly virulent. Paired titres from the same individual at different times would have been useful to determine the presence and timing of infection, but this was not possible for this study.

Even if hunting dogs infrequently have direct contact with wild carnivores, they are urinating and defaecating in the forest where wildlife may be exposed. Because many carnivore species use urine and faeces to mark their territories, they are likely to investigate any dog urine and faeces they encounter in the forest. Given that dog and cat pathogens can and do cross taxonomic lines, this situation allows for disease transmission. Dogs from a large population in which many diseases are endemic enter the forest and may contact susceptible wildlife species, which may have little or no immunity to these pathogens.
