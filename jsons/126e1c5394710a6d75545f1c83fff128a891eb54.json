One of the first reported incidents in the United Kingdom was in early March 2020, when a Singaporean international student was physically assaulted in central London; this was a completely unprovoked attack and the victim required reconstructive surgery for his injuries. In the same week, a Vietnamese art curator in London was dropped from an art exhibition, having been told that her presence alone would increase anxiety to those attending the event (2). These incidents happened before lockdown measures were introduced, suggesting that when lockdown measures are eased again, that repeat incidents will likely occur.",

Ostracisation of East Asian minority groups from wider society has manifested from this rise in xenophobia. Whilst this letter has highlighted cases in the Anglosphere, these incidents have occurred all over the world. In order to reduce stigma to all Asian minority groups, wider education must be implemented to decrease the spread of misinformation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Given the huge economic ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak, many people have sought to blame Asian communities. With many countries still in lockdown, there has been an alarming 900% rise in cyber abuse to both Chinese and non-Chinese Asian people (5) . When lockdown measures are eased, this anti-Asian sentiment will still be prevalent. Furthermore, due to the rapid escalation of the coronavirus outbreak and the implementation of lockdown across the world, almost no formal statistics have been released on racially motivated hate crimes specifically due to coronavirus. Analysis of these statistics will prove vital in order for healthcare and social services to adequately prepare for a spike in hate crimes towards Asian communities, especially when lockdown measures are eased.",

They highlighted key economic implications such as the direct impact on primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy. Socially, they illustrated the impact on domestic abuse and the gaming industry. This letter builds on the social impact of coronavirus by covering the important global rise in xenophobia towards people of Chinese and East Asian ethnic origin. Similar phenomena have occurred in other disease pandemics; pogroms against Jewish communities for the bubonic plague, stigmatisation of the LGBTQ+ community in the HIV outbreak of the 1980s and recently, xenophobia towards the Afro-Caribbean population during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Xenophobia has spread much like the virus itself, affecting those not just of Chinese descent but to those of any East Asian origin or nationality. Although this has been a global phenomenon, there has been a particularly large surge of racist incidents towards East Asian people in the Anglosphere where there are large Asian minority groups. This letter highlights some examples of overt physical hate crimes, as well as more subtle incidents of stigmatisation faced by East Asian ethnic minorities.",
