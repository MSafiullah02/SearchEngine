            "text": "In this context, after a pioneer paper entitled \u2018The Biological Functions of Low-Frequency Phonons\u2019 [18] published in 1977, a series of investigations into biopolymers from dynamic point of view have been stimulated. These studies have suggested that low-frequency (or terahertz frequency) collective motions do exist in proteins and DNA that hold a very high potential to reveal the profound dynamic mechanisms of many marvelous biological functions in biological systems (see, e.g. [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] and a comprehensive review [33]). This kind of inferences has been later observed by NMR [34], and been further used for medical treatments [35], [36]. In view of this, to understand really the interaction mechanism of drugs with proteins or DNA, we should consider not only the static structures concerned but also the dynamical information obtained by simulating their interactions through a dynamic process. The present study was attempted to address this problem from the angle of Molecular Dynamics (MD). In fact, since the advent of MD with the work of Karplus et al. [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], MD has become a computational technique to investigate structure and function of biomolecules and their respective complexes and interactions. It is also of high relevance taking into account that the previous structure of the polymeric double helix of DNA as well as the non-covalent binding (in dark) between DNA and drug has a strong influence on the subsequent photoreaction and therefore on their biological activity [43], [44]. Consequently, MD studies of the biopolymers including polypeptides or polynucleotide DNA\u2013Drug complexes are of the major relevance too [32], [45]. In general, the analysis of the MD trajectories (MDTs) resulting from the integration of the equations of motions in MD remains, however, the greatest challenge and requires a great deal of insight, experience, and effort. In a recent and very important work, Hamacher [46] proposed a new, theoretical sound, and versatile analysis procedure that provide scientists with a semi-quantitative invariant measures to compare various scenarios of their respective simulations.",

            "text": "In this sense, several authors have used pseudo-folding lattice Hydrophobicity-Polarity (HP) models to simulate polymer folding making simulations to optimize the lattice structure and resemble real folding [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71]. However, we can choose notably simpler polymer chain pseudo-folding rules to avoid optimization procedures and speed up notably the construction of the lattice. In this sense, useful graph representations of DNA, RNA and/or protein sequences have been introduced by Gates [72], Nandy [73], Leong [74], Randic et al. [75] based on 2D coordinate systems. We call these graph representations as polymer sequence pseudo-folding Lattice Networks (LNs) because they look like lattice structures and in fact we are forcing a sequence to fold in a way that not necessarily occurs in nature. In general, these LNs (as for other polymer graph representations) can be numerically characterized with Topological Indices (TIs), see for instance the previous paper series published by our group on Polymers [76], [77], [78], [79]. These TIs describe the distribution of amino acids or nucleotides along the polymeric chain but also encode higher-order information or other type of information on polymer mixtures. Thus lattice pseudo-folding TIs can be used in protein Quantitative Structure\u2013Property Relationships (QSARs) [7], [81] to connect polymeric structure with physicochemical or biological properties. Our group has used the approach called MARCH-INSIDE to calculate these TIs of pseudo-folding lattice-like networks to predict diverse protein or DNA/RNA functions. For instance, we have used stochastic pseudo-folding spectral moments to predict Ribonucleases [82] and Dyneins [83]. The MARCH-INSIDE pseudo-folding TIs can be calculated when we sum the respective indices for each node of the graph. All the above-mentioned values were used recently to predict microbacterial promoters and compare entropies, spectral moments, and pseudo-folding electrostatic potentials [84]. The readers may see three recent reviews discussing the applications ranging from graph of small molecules to graph or network representation of protein sequences and 3D structure, DNA sequences, RNA secondary structure, or human blood proteome mass spectroscopy outcomes [7], [81], [85].",

For instance we have constructed lattice network representations for mass spectroscopy results obtained from blood proteome samples typical of drugs causing cardiotoxicity [86]. After calculation of the sum of the TIs of each sample we used them to seek a new type of classifier. The model connects TIs values of the Mass Spectra of the blood proteome with the probability of appearance of drug cardiotoxicity [79], [87].

Here we isolate with 2D gel Electrophoresis and characterize with MALDI TPF MS all the peptides found on the PMF of a protein expressed on Leishmania infantum. The study of PMFs of new proteins may become an interesting source to fish new peptides with potential use as drug, in vaccine design, or as disease biomarkers. In particular, Leishmania parasitic species are the causal agents of Leishmaniosis one of the most important parasitic diseases [89], [90]. The toxicity and inefficacy of actual organic drugs against Leishmaniosis justify research projects to find new drugs or drug molecular targets in Leishmania species including L. infantum (L. infantum) and Leishmania major (L. major), both important pathogens [83], [91], [92], [93].

            "text": "One possibility to accomplish the former goal is the use of proteome research techniques. For instance, in proteome research authors often use a combination of 2D Electrophoresis (2DE) and Mass Spectroscopy (MS) to isolate and characterize new sequences from biological samples [96]. Obtaining the PMF of the protein is a very useful procedure in this sense [97]. In these cases, we employ informatics tools, such as Sequest or MASCOT, to have the MS outcomes for some of the more important peptides of the more similar proteins [98], [99]. It means that, for instance, MASCOT may give the collection of MS signals and the corresponding sequence of peptides present in known proteins that match with our MS input. In order to rank and select the best protein/peptide candidates MASCOT use the Mowse score (M\ns) [100]. If a template protein in the database has a high M\ns (>51), this protein has a PMF very similar to the PMF of our query proteins and we can detect a high sequence homology and perform function annotation. However, there is still another situation that often appears in proteome research and do not coincide exactly with the two situations above-mentioned in the first paragraph. We refer to the case when you identify a new protein, perform the MS analysis of PMF; introduce it in MASCOT (or other MS and sequence database) and the software identify some template candidates with an important M\ns that is not sufficiently high to accurately annotate the query protein (>40). In an excellent work have been reported an alternative to M\ns and discussed the limits of accurate scoring [101]. Nevertheless, if this kind of situation persists you have neither the sequence of the query protein nor the sequence of a template protein with high homology but you have the PMFs of both the query and the template. We call this situation here as: the query sequence missing and Low-Mowse scoring case. Independently from the possibility of function annotation of Low-Mowse proteins this kind of PMFs are, in our opinion, ideal sources to fish interesting peptides with bioinformatics methods. Anyhow, from these facts we can conclude that the method used to compare different peptides in this search is very important.",

            "text": "Bioinformatics methods based on Sequence alignment and similarity measures are very useful to perform sequence function annotation. Some authors have referred however that an alignment procedure may fail in cases of low sequence homology between the query and the template sequences deposited in the database. Alignment techniques are also useless if there is high query-template homology but we do not know the function of the template sequence deposited in the database [102]. On the other hand, some authors mentioned in the previous paragraphs have introduced 2D or higher dimension graph representations of sequences prior to the calculation of TIs. These representations are associated to algebraic structures that have been extended also to genetic codes [103], [104], [105]. This constitutes an important step in order to uncover useful higher-order information not encoded by 1D sequence parameters [73], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116], [117], [118]. In any case, we can use either the sequence directly or the graph parameter to develop phylogenetic trees in order to compare different peptides. Phylogenetic analysis often relays on tree graph construction. Applications of graphs and networks in phylogenetics are too broad a topic for detailed treatment here. The reader can consult reviews and compilations on this topic for an overview of this area [120]. Phylogenetics is commonly used to predict which amino acid residues are critical for the function of a given protein [121]. However, such approaches do have inherent limitations, such as the requirement for the identification of multiple homologs of the protein under consideration. Thibert and Bredesen [122] reported a study of cancer proteins in an extensive human PIN constructed by computational methods. They compared a couple of phylogenetic approaches to several different network-based methods. Another interesting direction is the use of TIs of the DNA, RNA and/or protein graph representations described above to construct phylogenetic trees in an alignment-independent way. For instance, Zupan and Randi\u010d [123] studied Spectrum-like and Zig\u2013Zag representations of the beta-globin gene for different species and also obtained phylogenetic trees without alignment. In another paper, Liao proposed a 2D graphical representation of a DNA sequence [124]. Liao et al. [125] used this representation as a basis to compute the similarities between 11 mitochondrial sequences belonging to different species and used the elements of the similarity matrix to construct the phylogenic tree. Among all above-mentioned, Liao, Randic, Basak, Vackro, Nandy and Wang [108], [118] associated a DNA sequence having n bases with n\n \u00d7 \nn non-negative real symmetric matrix A with elements aij and use its leading eigenvalue to characterize the DNA sequence in phylogenetic studies. These matrices have been derived from 2DD representations and different TIs calculated [126]. On the other hand, Zhang et al. [127] very recently introduced TIs referred to as Zinv for 3DD curves and used them to analyze the phylogenetic relationships for the seven HA (H5N1) sequences of avian influenza virus. The equations used in these methods to calculate the indices Inv(A) and Zinv(A) as well as the phylogenetic distances between two peptides p and q are given as follows [127], see Equations (1), (2), (3), (4). In closing, in the Experiment 2 we recognize the necessity of new peptide phylogenetic methods, the success of TIs of LN to encode sequence information, and the importance of MDT studies. Consequently, based on these facts we introduce a new phylogenetic method based on \u03bek(L) values.(1)Inv(A)=1n\u22121\u2211i=1n(\u2211j=1naij)\n(2)Zinv(A)=1n\u2212(1n)\u2211i=1n(\u2211j=1naij)\n(3)Dpq(Inv)=\u2211k=1m[Invk(p)\u2212Invk(q)]2\n(4)Dpq(Zinv)=\u2211k=1m[Zinvk(p)\u2212Zinvk(q)]2On the other hand, in Experiment 2: we shall deal with the following questions: (a) generalization of LN to represent DNA\u2013Drug MDTs, (b) calculation a new class of TIs for MDT networks based on the MARCH-INSIDE approach, and (c) development of a new scoring function for DNA\u2013Drug Docking. The TIs introduced here are the Mean values of a Markov Chain associated to the LN of an MDT. These mean values may be average values of atomic electronegativities, amino acid electrostatic potentials, intensity of Mass/charge signals in Mass Spectroscopy or other parameters. The type of parameter obtained depends on the type of systems under study (molecules, proteins, Mass Spectra), the parts of the system (atoms, amino acids, MS signals), and the property used to describe these parts (electronegativities, electrostatic charge, signal intensity). For instance, in other works, we used Markov chain pseudo-folding electrostatic potentials to found models that predict Polygalacturonases [117] or human colon and breast cancer biomarkers [129]. In this experiment we found a model that can be used as scoring function to evaluate DNA\u2013Drug Docking search. These models belong to a general class of methods known as QSARs are devoted to unravel structural and physicochemical requirements for biological activity in a great variety of compounds [130]. The classic QSAR studies connect information of the chemical structure of the molecule, expressed by means of numbers, with the biological activity [55]. However, QSAR-like procedures are not restricted to drugs and biological activity but other systems and properties, such as proteins or DNA/RNA may be predicted [132], [133], [134], [135]. One special class of indices used in QSAR are the TIs of molecular graphs; which indicates the presence of vertices or nodes (atoms) and connections or edges between nodes (chemical bonds) [136], [137], [138], [139]. Nevertheless, we can use TIs of different types of graph representations or networks may be used. In these networks, amino acids, nucleotides, enzymes, microorganisms, cerebral cortex regions, web pages, social groups, etc., may play the role of nodes and electrostatic interactions, mutations, metabolic reactions, host\u2013parasite relationships, brain region co-activations, links, diseases propagations, etc. may play the role of edges [7], [140], [141], [142], [143], [144], [145]. Many authors prefer to use the term Quantitative Structure-Binding affinity Relationship (QSBR) when one use QSAR-like procedures to predict drug\u2013target binding affinity and 3D structural information [146]. In any case, both approaches QSAR and QSBR diverge in some degree on the type of measure (activity or binding) and sometimes on how detailed we need to know the chemical structure (2D or 3D) but both use essentially the same algorithm. In addition to predicting drug activity we can use 3D drug-target QSAR/QSBR models as scoring function to guide the search of optimal drug\u2013target interaction geometries in drug\u2013target Docking studies [147], [148], [149]. Almost all QSAR/QSBR or other types of Docking-scoring functions are aimed to predict protein-drug interactions. For instance, Wang et al. [150] reported a comparative study of eleven whereas Ferrara et al. [151] studied nine different Docking-scoring functions all for Protein\u2013drug interactions. Conversely, DNA\u2013Drug and RNA\u2013Drug Docking are generally less investigated. In particular, we did not found a QSBR scoring function for DNA\u2013Furocoumarin Docking. The furocoumarins are a class of natural or synthetic compounds with very interesting pharmacological properties [152]. Commonly used in the treatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis and mycosis fungoides [153]. This treatment called PUVA consists in a therapy that combines the use of both chemicals and long-wave ultraviolet light (UV-A) [154]. The molecular base of PUVA is connected with the highly specific photo damage in DNA of epidermal cells. This damage interferes with the DNA replication, producing an inhibition of DNA synthesis which reduces or blocks the cell duplication [155]. Although the lineal furocoumarins (psoralens) are able to form the three adduct types, the geometry of the angular ones (angelicins) only allows them to form monoadducts with the DNA. On the other hand, it is well known that the side effects observed in PUVA therapy, such as skin phototoxicity and risk of skin cancer are strictly connected with the bi-functional lesions in DNA [156]. These facts points to the stability DNA\u2013Drug complex as a central factor in the activity of anticancer drugs in general including furocoumarins. In closing, in the Experiment 1 we recognize the necessity of new scoring functions for DNA\u2013Drug Docking methods, the importance of furocoumarins in PUVA therapy, the success of TIs of LN to encode sequence information, and the importance of MDT studies. Consequently, based on these facts we introduce a new DNA\u2013Drug scoring function for furocoumarins based on \u03bek(L) values.",

In Fig. 1\n, we illustrate an example of LN for an MDT. The key of the method we propose is the regrouping into four groups of the Energy values d\nE\ns obtained for different steps (s) of one MD trajectory after docking one drug with DNA. These four groups characterize the deviation of the energy value d\nE\ns from the average energy of the same MDT at different steps (MD-average); or the deviation from average energy values in same step for other MDTs (Step-average). First, the values of energy for an MDT are placed in a Cartesian 2D space starting with the first energy value at the coordinates (0, 0). The coordinates of the successive energy values are calculated as follows, in a similar manner than it can be used for a DNA or proteins [117]:(a)Increases in +1 the x axes; if d\nE\ns\n > MD-average and d\nE\ns\n > Step-average (upwards-step) or:(b)Decreases in \u22121 the x axes; if d\nE\ns\n > MD-average and d\nE\ns\n < Step-average (rightwards-step) or:(c)Increases in +1 the y axes; if d\nE\ns\n < MD-average and d\nE\ns\n > Step-average (leftwards-step) or:(d)Decreases in \u22121 the y axes; if d\nE\ns\n < MD-average and d\nE\ns\n < Step-average (downwards-step).\n",

In this sense, the force field AMBER94 [161] of molecular mechanics was used with distant-dependent dielectric constant (scale factor 1), electrostatic and Van der Waals values by default and cutoffs shifted with outer radius of 14 \u00c5 (see Fig. 2\n). All the components of the force field were included and the atom type was recalculated keeping their current charges. Previous to Monte Carlo simulation the geometry of all the structures of peptides where optimized with this same force field. Finally, the simulation was executed in the vacuum at 300 K and 100 optimization steps obtaining MDTs with 100 potential energy d\nEj (j\n = 1, 2, 3,\u2026100) values each one. We obtained 35 MDTs for 35 peptides. In order to obtain realistic MDTs there is an additional parameter we monitor in MD algorithms; which is known as the acceptance ratio (ACCR). It appears as ACCR on the list of possible selections in the MC Averages dialog box of HyperChem (see Fig. 2). The acceptance ratio is a running average of the ratio of the number of accepted moves to attempted moves. Optimal values are close to 0.5. Varying the step size can have a large effect on the acceptance ratio. The step size, \u0394r, is the maximum allowed atomic displacement used in the generation of trial configurations. The default value of r in HyperChem is 0.05 \u00c5 [159]. For most organic molecules, this will result in an acceptance ratio of about 0.5 \u00c5, which means that about 50% of all moves are accepted. Increasing the size of the trial displacements may lead to more complete searching of configuration space, but the acceptance ratio will, in general, decrease. Smaller displacements generally lead to higher acceptance ratios but result in more limited sampling. There has been little research to date on what the optimum value of the acceptance ratio should be. Most researchers tend to try for an average value around 0.5; smaller values may be appropriate when longer runs are acceptable and more extensive sampling is necessary [159].",

Thus, the minimized molecular structures were intercalated by hand approach in the DNA fragment, using the HyperChem package and taking into account the following experimentally demonstrated statements:1.In the dark, the poly[dA\u2013dT] poly[dA\u2013dT] sequence in DNA is the most favorable site for intercalation since the further photoreaction takes place mainly on the 5,6 double bond of the thymine [165]. So, the optimized molecules were inserted among the thymine units in a parallel plane to the bases and, according to our decision, in a halfway position (Fig. 3\n, left).2.The furocoumarins have two reactive sites, but after photoreaction, different types of cycloadducts can be formed: mono (furan-side or pyrone-side) and di-adducts (the cross-link) [166]. Although psoralens are able to form all the cycloadduct types, angelicins forms only monoadducts owing to their angular molecular structure. Keeping this in mind, for each lineal molecule we modeled only one starting conformation, for which the cycloadduct formation by either one or other reactive site (furan or pyrone-side) is equally feasible from a geometric point of view. For each angular molecule we decided to model two starting conformations, one for each monoadduct formation (for the furan-side that we named as j-conformation and for the pyrone-side that we named as c-conformation).3.The stereochemistry of the furocoumarins adducts is cis\u2013syn\n[167], [168]. Consequently, the molecules were oriented in such a way that the intercalation complex favors mainly the formation of cycloadducts with this stereochemistry. In the case of the furan-side, the stereochemistry syn means that the furan O1\u2032 and the pyrimidine N1 are going to be on the adjacent corners of the future cyclobutane ring. For the pyrone-side, the stereochemistry syn is defined as having the carbonyl-carbon of the pyrone ring and the N1 of the pyrimidine on the adjacent corners of the future cyclobutane ring (Fig. 3, right).\n",

In both Table 1 and Fig. 2, the variations of these geometric parameters used to model the j-conformations are represented in a simplified way. Taking this aspects into consideration the notation of a MD trajectory is given here as follows. We used the notation: m-[Bond/Dist./Ang.]; where: m is the number of the compound in Table 2\nor Table 3\n, Bond = \nj, c, or j&c are the chemical bonds susceptible of photoaddition in this position; whereas Dist. and Ang. are the distance and angular intercalation parameters, respectively (see also Table 1).",

We obtained in total 422 MDTs for these compounds. We constructed 422 LNs (one for each MD trajectory) transformed them in a vector of 11 \u03c0\nk(d) values for the compound and 11 \u03bek(L) values for the MDt (see previous sections). Were grouped all these 422 MDTs on two sets composed by MDTs of complexes between DNA and active compounds and other composed by trajectories of active compounds with no-optimal MDTs and/or trajectories of non-active compounds. In general, compounds as 4\u2032-MAP and the 4-MBAP, with activities (ID50 relative to 8-MOP) of 0.13 and 0.14 are considered as poorly active [169], [170]. The biological activity of these compounds is normally studied by evaluating of their capacity of forming an intercalated complex with DNA and their ability of photo-binding through mono- or bi-functional addition to the same macromolecule [171]. A traditional procedure to determine the photobiological and antiproliferative activity of furocoumarins is based on ID50, the UVA dose that reduces to 50% of the DNA synthesis in Ehrlich Ascites tumor cells (EATC) in presence of tested compound at certain concentration (18\u201320 \u03bcM). The protocols used in the activity determination are heterogeneous, however it is very common the use of the 8-MOP as reference to express the activity [169], [170], [172].",

QSBR studies were carried out to obtain models that allow us to classify the furocoumarins derivatives in one of these two activity groups. We selected Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [173], [174] to fit the discriminant function as implemented in the LDA module of the STATISTICA 6.0 software package [175]. Forward-stepwise algorithm was used for variable selection [176], [177], [178]. The statistical significance of the LDA model was determined with Fisher ratio (F) and the respective p-level (p). All the variables included in the model were standardized in order to bring it into the same scale. Subsequently, a standardized linear discriminant equation that allows to compare their coefficients is obtained [179]. We also inspected the Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity of the model for both training and external validation series. Last, cases/adjustable parameters ratios (\u03c1), and number of variables to be explored to avoid over-fitting or chance correlation [176], [177].

The \u03c7k(D) contains only information about atom-atom connectivity patterns and electronic distribution on the drug but do not incorporate MDT information. In consequence, \u03c7k(D) are unable to account for MDTs. The approach used to calculate \u03c7k(D) with MARCH-INISDE is essentially the same used to calculate \u03bek(D) values but use the Markov matrix of a molecular graph instead of an LN. The details for calculating \u03c7k(D) values are well known and have been published; thus we refer to these references by reasons of space [180], [181].",

In this figure we have done a zooming in the left-to-down corner to highlight an area of high density of spots, which apparently corresponds to protein fragments of low MW and low pI. Our interest in this area derived from the fact that these spots remained unchanged from gel to gel repetitions and might correspond to relevant proteins of this parasite.

All these proteins have Mowse values lower that the threshold value of 51 used to identify proteins with significant similarity. In any case, many of them have been also recorded with unknown function or as hypothetical proteins. Taking into consideration we can consider this protein as low-Mowse score case (because no protein in MASCOT search with known function has a high score). As we referred in introduction precisely the PMF of this type of protein may be of high interest. In Table 5\nwe give detailed information on the results of the MS analysis of the PMF of the new protein using MALDI-TOF technique and MASCOT search engine. Similar combination have been successfully used in the past to study Trichinella antigens [157] and possible Leishmania dynein proteins [83]. In this table we have shown only the 35 more interesting peptides matching with the MS of other proteins on the MASCOT search. Considering the high importance of phylogenetic analysis in the next section we propose a new algorithm for phylogenetic tree construction based MDTs and using this set of peptides as case study.",

In Materials and method we outlined the possibility of construction of a phylogenetic tree for the PMFs of the new protein described above using Equation (9). For it, we have calculated first the \u03bek(L) for the 35 more relevant peptides (see Table 7\n) and later the peptide\u2013peptide distance using Equation (9). In Fig. 6\nwe illustrate that there are notable differences on the grouping of the 35 peptides if we use the traditional sequence similarity method or alternatively the present approach. This results show that in principle the distance D\npq(\u03be) between a peptide p and other q based on \u03bek(L) values of MDTs codify information essentially different to sequence similarity. In this sense, the present molecular phylogenetic algorithm may become an alternative to traditional methods.",

The procedure forces one MD trajectory to fold into a 2D Cartesian coordinates system using a step-by-step procedure driven by simple rules. The graphical representation of this space has the form of a lattice network symbolized as LN. We can use \u03bek(L) values of LN to develop new algorithms to perform molecular Phylogenetic analysis of peptides based on MDTs instead of the sequence of the polypeptide. The new procedure combined with 2D Electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS can be applied to analyze Peptide Mass Fingerprints of new proteins. We can use the same idea to seek scoring functions for DNA\u2013Drug Docking simulations. The work opens new perspective on the analysis and applications MD on biopolymers sciences.",
