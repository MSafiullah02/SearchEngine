At the interface between enormous global biomedical-biotechnology research activities and the small, esoteric world of paper science, bioactive-paper research targets exciting new paper products, aiming to improve the quality of life world-wide. VTT (a Finnish research organization) defined bioactive paper as \u201cpaper-like products, cardboard, fabrics and their combinations, etc., with active recognition and/or functional material capabilities\u201d [1].",

The dried paper sheet may be coated either directly on the paper machine or in a separate operation. From the perspective of bioactive paper, critical properties include surface chemistry, porosity and optical properties. In subsequent sections, I show that surface chemistry influences biomolecule immobilization, non-specific binding and color expression in enzyme-catalyzed reporting assays. Porosity, together with surface chemistry, influences wet properties, which are important for bioactive-paper fabrication by printing or coating. Finally, the optical properties may influence color-based or fluorescence-based reporting schemes. For example, many commercial paper types are treated with fluorescent molecules, called optical brightening agents, which are added to make paper appear white. Such surfaces would give a very high background in fluorescence-detection assays.",

The results depend upon tree species, pulping type and whether or not the fibers have been dried after pulping. Drying causes some of the pores to collapse in an irreversible process called hornification [47]. Thus, dry, wet, and never-dried samples of the same paper could have very different pore-volume distributions.

It seems that paper treated with wet-strength resin may be a good substrate for the direct immobilization of biosensors. There are two caveats. The cationic surfaces will adsorb most biomacromolecules, so it may be necessary to use some kind of blocking to prevent non-specific adsorption [82]. Common blocking chemicals include Tween 20 (a non-ionic surfactant), BSA, casein or fat-free milk [83]. Second, there is no control of biosensor orientation and we might expect very cationic and reactive surfaces to denature protein-based and DNA-based sensors. The general sense from the literature is therefore that direct application is not a robust strategy because every biosensor/paper combination would have to be optimized before use.",

When dilute suspensions of latex particles, coated with antibodies, are exposed to antigen, antibody-antigen binding causes the latex dispersion to aggregate giving a visible response [91]. The early work involved polystyrene latexes, available as monodispersed particles, which had clean surfaces and could be magnetic. Streptavidin adsorbs spontaneously and irreversibly, giving particles that will bind biotinylated biosensors [92], [93]. Pichot\u2019s group reported extensively on the preparation and the characterization of a wide variety of polymer colloids as potential support particles for biosensors [94]. They concluded that colloidal microgels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) [95] were superior because PNIPAM gives little non-specific protein binding [96]. Following from Pichot\u2019s work, my colleagues and I covalently coupled DNA aptamers and antibodies to carboxylated PNIPAM microgels [17]. Fig. 7\nshows the conjugation chemistry.

Finally, the test surface is exposed to the substrate solution for the immobilized enzyme that catalyzes the production of a colored or fluorescent product.

            "text": "Li\u2019s group have developed DNA aptamers with built-in fluorescent reporters [101] (e.g. Fig. 11\n). Initially, the DNA aptamer is present as a duplex with a short DNA molecule labeled with a quencher (Q). The aptamer is also made to form a second duplex with another short DNA molecule labeled with a fluorescent group, so the fluorescence of the aptamer in the unbound state is quenched. When the target, ATP in this case, is introduced, the duplex dissociates in favor of forming an aptamer-ATP complex which fluoresces. Su et al. have shown that Li\u2019s aptamers can be immobilized on microgels that can be inkjet printed onto paper, giving an aptamer-based sensor-reporter combination [17].",

Gold nanoparticles in size range 10\u201350 nm have an intense red color when the particles are separated by a distance equivalent to a few particle diameters. The color changes to purple when aggregation brings the particles closer together. In a typical sensing application, the particles are coated antibodies or aptamers [102] and a color change is observed when the target antigen induces aggregation of the gold particles. This is an attractive approach because the colors are very intense, typically nanogold-extinction coefficients are more than 1000 times greater than those of organic dyes [10]. In addition, the ability of thiols to chemisorb onto gold provides a simple route to immobilization. Fig. 12\nshows a schematic representation of a DNA-aptamer biosensor employing a nanogold sensor [10].",

            "text": "Most publications describe nanogold sensors that are dispersions in buffers. For gold to be useful on bioactive paper, the nanoparticles must function after drying and subsequent wetting of the sensor. Zhao et al. recently describe a paper-supported gold biosensor capable of detecting the presence of DNase I, an endonuclease, and adenosine, a small biomolecule [23]. For both targets, the biosensor functions by causing the dissociation of a gold-nanoparticle aggregate to give an intense red color (see Fig. 13\n). The DNase I sensor functions by degrading the DNA chains bridging the nanoparticles, whereas, with the adenosine sensor, the gold particles are weakly aggregated with an adenosine aptamer. The presence of adenosine strips the aptamer from the gold, causing the particles to disperse. This is an important publication because it demonstrates that a sensitive biosensor can be dried on paper, heated and stored while retaining activity upon subsequent exposure to the target solution. From a paper-science perspective, Zhao\u2019s work is important because it shows that the details of the paper substrate are important. Papers coated with hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers were suitable for the nanoparticle assay, whereas untreated filter paper was not because capillary forces caused the spotted nanoparticles to bleed over too great an area.",
