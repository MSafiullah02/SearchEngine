It has also become clear that the interplay between the body surfaces of the alimentary tract, particularly the gut, and its resident commensal microflora presents not a silent landscape but rather a theater in which there is constant movement and chatter between the host cells and a myriad of microbial species. Indeed, from a biologic perspective, we humans comprise a community in which we are outnumbered almost 10 to 1 by our prokaryotic neighbors [1]. Given its complexity, it is not surprising that such a finely tuned system is subject to profound perturbation by hematologic malignancies and their treatment.\n",

Cachexia will be exacerbated by anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal obstructions, as well as by metabolic disturbances. These perturbations may result in delayed tissue healing, mucosal atrophy with a decrease in the secretions of lysozyme and secretory IgA, as well as impairment of both the classical and alternative complement pathways.

The microbicidal capacity in vitro of neutrophils and T-lymphocyte function is reduced by iron deficiency though the clinical significance is uncertain. Iron overload occurring in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a risk factor for infection involving a variety of pathogens such as Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio spp., Plasmodium falciparum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp., and the agents of mucormycosis [6].

In patients with solid tumors, obstruction of natural passages can lead to inadequate drainage of secretory or excretory fluids from nasal sinuses, bronchi, and bile ducts. Furthermore, tissue invasion may create connections between normally sterile spaces and the environment through disruption of epithelial surfaces. Examples include perforation of the esophagus by mediastinal tumors, invasive gynecologic malignancies with local pelvic abscesses, skin ulcerations with cellulitis and deep soft-tissue infections, and invasion of the bowel wall by tumors with the lower gastrointestinal tract, resulting in bacteremia. Localizations in the central nervous system, spinal cord compression, and paraneoplastic neuropathy are associated with an increased risk of infection due to lethargy and, for instance, a diminished ability to cough and swallow, and incomplete emptying of the bladder [8].",

Topical antibiotics and those secreted in sweat will disturb the balance within the resident commensal flora, leaving the surface vulnerable to colonization by exogenous potential pathogens such as the gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics will also exert selective pressure on the resident flora, causing resistance to emerge, as has been observed during treatment with ciprofloxacin because the drug is secreted with sweat [16]. Chemotherapy and irradiation can bring about radical changes in the normal skin by interrupting normal cell replacement, resulting in hair loss, dryness, and loss of sweat production. The latter may also lead to lower levels of the antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, which is secreted in normal sweat and is an effector of innate immunity [17]. In addition, steroids also can exert a profound effect on sebum secretions. When the skin is broken, the release of fibronectin is thought to assist colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, and other changes facilitate colonization with gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterobacteriaceae. Cutaneous infection results from the loss of integrity and reduced local immunity of the skin as well as disturbances within the resident flora. Abraded skin and the associated exudates and minor breaches in the integument can lead to local infection as well as provide a reservoir that assists further spread to other body surfaces, including the oral cavity. When the balance is lost between the host defenses and resident commensal flora around the hair follicles, they can become inflamed and necrotic, forming a potential nidus of infection.",

Pulmonary hemorrhage as a result of profound thrombocytopenia further imperils the lung, increasing the risk of infection. However, the risk of invasion and dissemination is high when the integrity of the mucosa is impaired, the ecology of resident flora is disturbed, and exogenous microorganisms such as gram-negative bacilli or other potential pathogens establish colonization. Resident flora such as Candida spp. can result in superficial infection, often as a consequence of reactivation of herpes simplex virus [19, 20]. Clinically, the presence of pseudomembranes over the ulcerated tissue can initiate local invasion and progressive spread to the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract, resulting in disseminated candidiasis. Aspiration and inhalation of spores and hyphal elements of Aspergillus spp. and other molds permit colonization of the sinuses and bronchial tree, which may extend into the alveolar spaces, resulting in invasive disease that is often fatal.",

Most of the microbial flora is densely distributed around the surfaces of the oral cavity and the large bowel, where scores of different microorganisms, including spirochetes, spore formers, bacilli, and cocci, compete for the available surfaces and nutrients. Anaerobes predominate and play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy commensal flora, preventing the establishment of exogenous or allochthonous organisms, which is known as colonization resistance [25, 26]. The integrity of the mucosa, the production of saliva and mucus, peristalsis, gastric pH, bile acids, digestive enzymes, and the levels of secretory IgA also play an important role in maintaining colonization resistance [27].",

The most likely contributors to colonization resistance, the gram-positive non-spore forming, lactic acid-producing bacilli, particularly bifidobacteria, are particularly susceptible to antibiotics known to impair colonization resistance, including the penicillins, rifamycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, bacitracin, and vancomycin [24, 27, 31\u201336]. Some cephalosporins are also detrimental to colonization resistance, whereas meropenem and the quinolones have been declared \u201cfriendly\u201d [28, 34\u201339]. Some drugs such as aztreonam and imipenem only appear \u201cfriendly\u201d because they are inactivated by feces [30, 40], whereas under the circumstance of diarrhea, parenteral feeding, and gut toxicity, normal stool is no longer produced so these agents may remain sufficiently active to destroy what remains of the colonization resistance. Initially, co-trimoxazole was thought to be neutral [27, 34, 41\u201345], but other evidence suggests otherwise [46]. Individual antibiotics that appear to spare colonization resistance, such as ceftazidime and piperacillin, might have a marked impact when given in combination, leading to an increase in both Clostridium difficile as well as yeasts [47]. C. difficile can cause enterocolitis, which responds to treatment with metronidazole or oral vancomycin, but the latter may select for resistant bacteria such as Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus rhamnosus [48]. The widespread use of fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis has led to the emergence of resistance among the E. coli, which are indigenous to the bowel [49\u201352].",

The simultaneous activation of multiple PRRs provides virtually an infinite range of possibilities for tailoring an effective response to a wide range of microbes. However, overwhelming infection, deregulated expression or activation of PRRs, and failing negative feedback mechanisms can result in disruption of this finely tuned immune system, resulting in infections or uncontrolled inflammatory responses manifesting as autoimmune diseases and sometimes systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [63, 65].",

Phagocytosis, an Fc- and C3b receptor-mediated process with IgG1, IgG3, and C3b as ligands or opsonins, results in the uptake of particles larger than one micron via pseudopods until they enclose in a vacuole (phagosome).

These cells are also important in the intestinal tract for maintaining the immunologic homeostasis.

Na\u00efve T lymphocytes are sensitized by antigen-presenting cells and the differentiation and activation status depends on multiple conditions including contact between the T-cell receptor (TCR) with MCH molecules, contact between co-stimulatory receptors and an optimal cytokine environment. Tc plays an important role in viral infections and anti-tumor immunity. On activation after contact between the TCR and MCH class I molecules expressing antigens, cytotoxins such as perforin, granzyme, and granulysin are released. Perforin forms pores in the target cell\u2019s plasma membrane allowing granzymes to enter the target cell, which eventually leads to apoptosis. A second way to induce apoptosis is via cell-surface interactions between the Tc and the infected cell through Fas\u2013Fas ligand interactions. Th aid other immune and non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells, in their defensive actions. Several phenotypes have been defined based on cytokine signatures. However, new variants are still discovered and T-cell plasticity is increasingly recognized showing T cells capable of changing their phenotype, for instance, transition of Tregs into Th17 and vice versa has been reported [90]. Traditionally, Th1 and Th2 were recognized as functionally different Th subtypes [91]. Th1 cells (T bet) are generated from na\u00efve T cells under the influence of IL-12, and IFN\u03b3 and Th2 (GATA-3) under the influence of IL-4 and IL-5. Recently, a third subset was discovered, named Th17 (ROR\u03b3t) generated by IL-1, IL-6, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-23 [92]. In their effector functions, these Th subsets also differ. Th1 cells release IL-2, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 and increase the phagocytic and killing capacity of normal macrophages helping them to eliminate intracellular organisms (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii, L. monocytogenes, and Aspergillus spp.). IFN\u03b3 also induced anti-viral defenses. Th2 release IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and are more specifically involved in extracellular parasitic and worm infections as they boost eosinophilic infiltration and activation. In addition, Th2 contributes to effective B-lymphocyte activation and immunoglobulin production. Th17 have largely been implicated in the defense against extracellular pathogens, both bacteria and fungi, residing at the host barriers of skin and mucosa. Th17 cells release IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22 contributing to chemotaxis of neutrophils and the increased release of antimicrobial proteins from epithelial cells.",

The common denominator is an uncontrolled inflammatory response resulting from excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Central in the pathogenesis of most of these inflammatory conditions is the occurrence of conditioning-induced tissue damage and disturbance of the normal host bacterial homeostasis in these tissues. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy initiate an inflammatory cascade by activating nuclear factor-\u03baB [99], resulting in the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3) by macrophages, IECs, and endothelial cells [99\u2013101]. This inflammatory response is subsequently aggravated by the loss of barriers facilitating the translocation of microbes or microbial wall components stimulating PRRs [102\u2013104] finally, resulting in clinical disorders.

This has been based on the concept \u201cenvironmentally determined genetic expression\u201d (EDGE), which states that the effects of normally silent genetic polymorphisms are unmasked when normal homeostasis is severely disrupted such as occurs after exposure to high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (Fig. 3) [107]. Several studies have shown SNPs in complement components (mannose-binding lectin), NK receptors, and PRRs resulting in increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections [108\u2013110]. These and other polymorphisms have also been related to other complications of cancer therapy and have been studied especially in the HSCT setting [111, 112]. Polymorphisms in PRRs is of importance in host\u2013microbe interactions such as NOD2, originally described in Crohn\u2019s disease, and TLRs have been implicated in the occurrence of GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and treatment-related mortality [113, 114]. Although contradictory results and lack of consistency do not permit firm conclusions, these polymorphisms have provided an insight into the pathogenesis of complex immunologic processes that occur following intensive anti-cancer treatment. Future studies are designed to address the applicability of this information in the prevention or treatment of infections and other complications in patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing HSCT. Modulating the innate immune system with the use of selective agonists and antagonists of TLRs and other PRRs could be a future therapeutic strategy ameliorating complications in cancer therapy [115, 116].\n",

After destruction of the mitotic pool by one or more cytotoxic compounds and depletion of the marrow pool reserve, granulocytopenia lasting days or weeks will ensue, particularly in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and following HSCT-conditioning regimens. Likewise, therapeutic radiation may induce a clinically significant granulocytopenia, depending on dose rate, total dose, irradiated area, and field size. Total body irradiation, as used in HSCT procedures, is the most illustrative of the potential deleterious effects of irradiation. However, both chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation do not only inhibit the proliferating cell pool, they also interfere with nonproliferating cells and their function. In granulocytes, this may result in decreased chemotaxis, diminished phagocytotic capacity, and defective intracellular killing. Glucocorticosteroids seem to enhance granulocytopoiesis and mobilize the marginal as well as marrow pool reserve, but these supposedly positive effects on the granulocytes are counterbalanced by numerous disadvantages. Indeed, these drugs restrain the accumulation of neutrophils at the site of inflammation through impaired migration, probably due to reduced adherent capacity of the granulocytes, and diminished chemotactic activity. Furthermore, they negatively influence phagocytosis and intracellular killing by neutrophils in a dose-dependent fashion and are associated with a reduction in the number of eosinophils in the blood. Finally, many other drugs, including antibiotics, that are regularly used in cancer patients are known to interfere with the production and function of granulocytes, which also may lead to an increased susceptibility to infection.",

Depending on the duration of neutropenia, the risk of a febrile episode varies between 30 and 80 %. In a study by Bodey et al. [117], all patients with a neutrophil count of less than 100/\u03bcL for more than 3 weeks developed an infectious complication, and the risk for secondary infections increased proportionally with the duration of granulocytopenia.

Likewise, the increased susceptibility to pneumococci and H. influenzae in patients with CLL or multiple myeloma may be replaced by a defect in cellular immunity and neutrophil function when these patients are being treated with glucocorticosteroids or other agents. Whether patients with hypogammaglobulinemia due to CLL should routinely receive intravenous immunoglobulins has been a matter of considerable debate. A cost-effectiveness analysis has suggested that indiscriminate replacement may not improve quality or length of life in this patient group, and that it is extraordinarily expensive [125]. However, such a decision analysis model cannot be applied to the individual patient who actually has suffered from recurrent bacterial infections. Therefore, it seems reasonable to institute immunoglobulin replacement in those patients who have had a documented infection with pneumococcus or H. influenzae and have decreased serum IgG concentrations.",

Mucositis results in significant morbidity and markedly lowers the quality of life for several weeks following cytotoxic chemotherapy and irradiation. Modern remission-induction cytostatic chemotherapy and conditioning regimens for HSCT often induce substantial injury to the mucosa. Combinations containing melphalan, etoposide, methotrexate, cytarabine, and idarubicin have all been shown to induce mucositis [134, 135]. Mucositis can be particularly severe when anthracyclines are combined with total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide to condition patients for an allogeneic HSCT [136]. The duration and incidence of fever, parenteral narcotic use, total parenteral nutrition, antibiotic therapy, and the length of stay in a hospital are all correlated with the severity of mucositis, as is the risk of significant infections and mortality [134, 137, 138].

In addition, gingivitis as the source of S. epidermidis bacteremia has been reported [145]. Similar risk factors are associated with bacteremia due to members of the S. milleri group [146]. The chlorhexidine mouthwashes used to minimize infective complications arising from the oral toxicity induced by chemotherapy also influence the microflora [133, 147, 148]. The oral flora may also change as a direct result of chemotherapy [149], and it is likely that more intensive conditioning regimens will aggravate mucositis, leading to a commensurate increase in the number of unusual bacteria.",

The increased absorption of sugars such as rhamnose, mannose, and lactulose and the decreased uptake of xylose after chemotherapy, irradiation, or a combination of both indicate a loss of integrity and damage to tight junctions [135, 153, 154]. Impaired gut function and integrity may also facilitate translocation, and blood stream infections of patients colonized with bacteria and fungi [155]. Gut toxicity has also been shown to be responsible for the reduced absorption of quinolones [156, 157] and has been implicated in the erratic bioavailability of the antifungal agent itraconazole and posaconazole [158, 159]. A dysfunctional gut will also have a marked effect on the nutritional status of the patient not least by the diminished release of citrulline by the lower number of functioning enterocytes [160]. This amino acid can be detected in blood and used to determine the extent of gut injury in stem cell transplant recipients [160].",

More recently, the role of neutropenic enterocolitis or typhlitis, a severe form of mucosal damage of the gut induced by cytotoxic therapy, has also become clearer in providing a portal of entry for various toxin-producing bacteria, including S. aureus,\nP. aeruginosa, various Clostridium spp. and even Bacillus cereus [165\u2013168]. This illustrates how the delicate balance between the host and the resident microflora can be disturbed in the setting of mucosal barrier injury and prolonged exposure to antibiotics. Colonization by Candida species of the mucosal surfaces appears to be a prerequisite for local mucosal infection and subsequent invasive disease [169]. Mucosal barrier injury, including neutropenic enterocolitis, is also an independent risk factor for invasive candidiasis among patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy [135, 153].",

Also, the risk of infection is significantly higher during chemotherapy cycles that are complicated by mucositis than during those without mucositis. This has been shown for bacteremia due to oral viridans streptococci mainly S. mitis and S. oralis [184]. Drug-induced achlorhydria and the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis with typically but not exclusively fluoroquinolones also contributes toward the development of bacteremia [142].",

Adherence to these surfaces appears to be a prerequisite for local infection and subsequent invasive disease since regular surveillance cultures of hematologic patients have shown that colonization invariably precedes infection [52].

SCT recipients prepared with regimens composed of TBI and patients treated with remission-induction regimens have an increased risk of developing invasive Candida disease.",

Rather, the risk of infection is the product of the interplay between the many lines of defense, all of which can be breached simultaneously. Moreover, any attempt to confine the damage inflicted upon the host defenses by protecting only one specific line of defense such as the use of growth factors to stimulate hematopoiesis is likely to offer only limited benefit. What is required is a two-pronged approach involving more selective cancer treatment, to avoid damaging healthy tissue combined with strategies that prevent, or at least ameliorate, any unavoidable toxicity. This requires a holistic approach involving both the laboratory and the clinician in continuing to refine therapeutic regimens that are effective and in designing others to cope with the morbidity associated with impaired host defenses. Both are essential to successfully achieve remission of neoplastic disease and to maintain the best quality of life for the patient.",

Neutropenic enterocolitis (also known as typhlitis) is an example of the interplay between the nature of the chemotherapeutic regimen, the mucosal barrier injury it induces, the indigenous microbial flora that remains after exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, and the absence of neutrophils. Certain cytotoxic drugs e.g., cytarabine can disrupt the mucosal barrier of the gut as well as causing protracted neutropenia and hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia. Necrosis of the gastrointestinal mucosa particularly of the terminal ileum or cecum manifests as enterocolitis and predisposes the patient to infection with any organism capable of invasion. Antimicrobial treatment, first with selective antimicrobial prophylaxis e.g., with a fluoroquinolone and later with broad-spectrum antibiotics e.g., ceftazidime, will profoundly disturb the normal resident flora and may provide a selective advantage to a resistant bacterium such as Clostridium septicum. The stage is set for neutropenic enterocolitis associated with infection. Neutropenic enterocolitis is not only a paradigm for MBI but is also the most severe clinical manifestation of MBI",
