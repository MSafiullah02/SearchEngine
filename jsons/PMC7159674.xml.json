This suggests the existence of a complex relationship between IFNL4 and HCV in humans, similar to that recently described for IFN\u20101 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice,5 where chronic IFN\u2010I signalling due to persistent infection drives immunosuppression and disease progression.",

Among other approaches, the assessment of the missense variants previously described in the IFNL4 coding region,2 may help unravel this issue.",
