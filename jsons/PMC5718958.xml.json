            "text": "Over the past decade, Intensive Care Medicine has led the way in identifying a group of critically ill patients who have both an underlying disease (linked to immune suppression) and an acute trigger (immune-, malignancy-, or infection-related) that result in an increased TH1 response marked by cooperation between T cells and macrophages as well as the effectors of the interferon gamma response which activate the reticuloendothelial system [1, 2]. These patients have uncontrolled inflammation and high mortality that appears to be reduced by early treatment of hemophagocytic lympho histiocytosis (fHLH) within 24 h of diagnosis (median 5 h) [1, 2]. These patients fulfill 5 of 8 criteria including (1) fever >7 days, (2) splenomegaly, (3) bicytopenia (hemoglobin <9 g/dL, platelet count <100,000 mm3, neutrophil count <1100/mm3), (4) hypertriglyceridemia (>3.0 mmol/L fasting value), or hyperferritinemia (>500 ng/L), (5) low (<10%) or absent NK cell activity, (6) hypofibrinemia (<1.5 g/dL), (7) increased soluble CD25 levels (>2400 IU/mL), and (8) histological hemophagocytosis in reticulo-endothelial system organs including spleen, liver, bone marrow, or lymph nodes. Authors have recently proposed adding aspartate aminotransferase and underlying immune suppression to the eight criteria to craft an \u2018H-score\u2019 that facilitates early diagnostic certainty [3]. These clinical criteria do not distinguish between patients with familial fHLH, reactive hemophagocytic lympho histiocytosis (rHLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), or sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [4, 5].",

Etiologies for uncontrolled inflammation in adults and older children are often related to (1) viral, intracellular, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections (sepsis-induced MODS/rHLH), (2) cancer or other immune deficiencies (rHLH), and (3) systemic diseases including autoimmune disease and drug exposures (MAS) [1, 2, 4, 5]. To help address diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in this regard, we illustrate five prototypical cases that provide a \u2018consideration framework\u2019 for potential clinical approaches (Fig. 1), recognizing that the absence of any randomized trials is the basis of considerable controversy regarding treatment choices.\n",

A bone marrow aspirate is attained and the infant is started on dexamethasone, IVIG, and etoposide. The genetic analysis comes back 1 month later showing a homozygous UNC13D gene variant which leads to ineffective NK cell killing of virus infection and ineffective activated immune cell death. After recovery, the child is brought back for bone marrow transplantation. The etiology is commonly a viral infection in a host who has a genetically determined inability to induce granzyme\u2013perforin-mediated cytolytic killing. In these children, non-malignant lymphoproliferation leads to high levels of lymphocyte derived interferon \u03b3 that activates macrophages. Dexamethasone induces lymphocyte apoptosis and reduces macrophage activation, IVIG neutralizes the viral infection, and etoposide kills proliferating CD8 lymphocytes [6, 7].",

The intensivist suspects florid DNA viremia, and obtains diagnostic tests for HSV, HHV6, HHV8, EBV, CMV, HIV, parvovirus, and BK virus to guide appropriate anti-viral therapy. Natural killer (NK) cells recover from chemotherapy long after neutrophils [8, 9]. Macrophage activation is driven by CPG motifs of DNA viruses stimulating TLR9-mediated inflammasome activation that, in the absence of NK cells, is uncontrolled. When NK cells and blasts are absent, consideration can be given to holding chemotherapy until NK counts recover. The DNA viruses are treated with IVIG and antivirals. Epstein\u2013Barr virus can be treated with anti CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) to eradicate the B cell reservoir. Anti-inflammatory biologics that decrease inflammation may also be considered while awaiting NK cell count recovery.",
