The cause of membrane rupture in most cases is unknown, but asymptomatic intrauterine infection is a frequent precursor. Risk factors for PPROM are generally similar to those for preterm spontaneous labour with intact membranes, although infections and tobacco exposure play important parts.12 Most women with PPROM begin labour spontaneously within several days, but a small proportion of women remains undelivered for weeks or months. Since the membranes generally form a barrier to ascending infection, a common complication of PPROM is development of intrauterine infection and preterm labour.13\n",

            "text": "Preterm labour is usually defined as regular contractions accompanied by cervical change at less than 37 weeks' gestation. Pathogenesis of preterm labour is not well understood, but preterm labour might represent early idiopathic activation of the normal labour process or the results of pathological insults. A role for the fetus in determining the timing of the onset of labour has been proposed on the basis of studies in sheep.14 Ablation of the fetal hypophysis or adrenal glands, or both, prevents the initiation of parturition; thus fetal cortisol is central to labour initiation in sheep. The same mechanism might be implicated in parturition in women, as suggested by reports of protracted pregnancies with an anencephalic fetus.15 Theories proposed to explain the initiation of term labour are: (1) progesterone withdrawal, (2) oxytocin initiation, and (3) decidual activation. The progesterone withdrawal theory stems from studies in sheep.14, 16 As parturition nears, the fetal-adrenal axis becomes more sensitive to adrenocorticotropic hormone, increasing the secretion of cortisol. Fetal cortisol stimulates placental 17\u03b1-hydroxylase activity, which decreases progesterone secretion and increases oestrogen production. The reversal in the oestrogen/progesterone ratio results in increased prostaglandin formation, initiating a cascade of events that culminates in labour. In human beings, serum progesterone concentrations do not fall as labour approaches;16 however, because progesterone antagonists\u2014such as RU486\u2014initiate preterm labour and progestational agents prevent preterm labour, a decrease in local progesterone concentrations or in the number of receptors is a plausible mechanism for initiation of labour.16, 17, 18 Because intravenous oxytocin increases the frequency and intensity of uterine contractions, the assumption is that oxytocin plays a part in labour initiation. However, blood concentrations of oxytocin do not rise before labour and the clearance of oxytocin remains constant; thus oxytocin is unlikely to initiate labour.",

Black women are also three to four times more likely to have a very early preterm birth than women from other racial or ethnic groups.22, 23 Part of the discrepancy in preterm birth rates between the USA and other countries might be explained by the high rate of preterm births in the USA black population. Over time, the disparity in preterm birth rates between black and white women has remained largely unchanged and unexplained, and contributes to a cycle of reproductive disadvantage with far-reaching social and medical consequences.24 East Asian and Hispanic women typically have low preterm birth rates. Women from south Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, have high rates of low birthweight caused by decreased fetal growth, but preterm delivery does not seem to be substantially increased. Other maternal demographic characteristics associated with preterm birth include low socioeconomic and educational status, low and high maternal ages, and single marital status.25, 26, 27 The mechanisms by which the maternal demographic characteristics are related to preterm birth are unknown.",

Although, the mechanism(s) underlying the association of depression and preterm birth is unknown, there is an association between depressed mood and a reduction in natural killer cell activity, and higher plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and their receptors.59 Inflammation, therefore, might also partly mediate the relation between depression and preterm birth.",

There are more than 3000 chemicals in cigarette smoke and the biological effects of most are unknown;63 however, both nicotine and carbon monoxide are powerful vasoconstrictors, and are associated with placental damage and decreased uteroplacental blood flow. Both pathways lead to fetal growth restriction and indicated preterm births. Smoking is also associated with a systemic inflammatory response and can increase spontaneous preterm birth through that pathway.64, 65 Although heavy alcohol consumption has been associated with preterm birth, neither mild nor moderate alcohol use is generally regarded as a risk factor for preterm birth.

Bacteria have been cultured from the chorioamnion in 15% of non-labouring women with intact membranes undergoing indicated caesarean delivery.67 Fluorescence in-situ hybridisation with a DNA probe specific for conserved regions of bacterial DNA (the 16S ribosomal RNA) has detected bacteria in the membranes of up to 70% of women undergoing elective caesarean section at term.85 These findings suggest that the presence of bacteria in the chorioamnion alone cannot be sufficient to cause an inflammatory response, preterm labour, and preterm birth.85 Nevertheless, bacteria in the membranes and an associated inflammatory response in the amniotic fluid have been identified in more than 80% of women in early preterm labour with intact membranes who underwent caesarean section.68 Thus, bacterial infection probably predisposes to preterm birth.",

Although most investigators believe that ascent happens during the second trimester, the timing is unknown; some women have asymptomatic endometrial colonisation before pregnancy.87 Irrespective of when colonisation occurs, the hypothesis is that only when the membranes become tightly applied to the decidua at about 20 weeks' gestation, essentially forming an abscess, do colonised women become symptomatic and progress to early preterm birth.67\n",

Both digital and ultrasound examinations of the cervix have shown that cervical shortening is a risk factor for preterm delivery.121, 122, 123 Ultrasound has proven especially useful in two circumstances: the first is in asymptomatic women, whereas the second is in those presenting with contractions. In asymptomatic women, at 24 weeks' gestation, a cervical length of less than 25 mm defines increased risk of preterm birth. The shorter the cervix, the greater the risk.122, 123 Women with preterm contractions often present a clinical dilemma, since nearly 60% of such women will, without treatment, deliver at term. Such women are usually observed for several hours before a decision is made to initiate tocolytic treatment, give corticosteroids, or discharge the patient. Cervical length can discriminate between women not in labour and those who carry a pronounced risk of early delivery. With a cervical length greater than 30 mm, the likelihood of delivering in the next week is about 1%, and most women can be safely discharged without treatment.124\n",

Studies of biomarkers have improved the understanding of the mechanisms of disease leading to spontaneous preterm birth, but few biomarkers have shown clinical usefulness.21 An important consideration is that, besides the specific nature of the analyte and its origin, an understanding of timing related to gestational age of collection and delivery is also necessary. For example, the concentration of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in serum rises substantially about 24 h before labour initiation.127 Such late prediction is of little value in prevention, but can aid in understanding the pathophysiology of preterm labour.
