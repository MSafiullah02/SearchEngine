Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics.",

Despite this positive news, the authors of the CDC guideline published in June 2019 a warning about misapplications of the guideline, such as reducing opioids used to treat cancer pain, rapid tapering of longterm opioid users, sudden discontinuation of opioid therapy, and prescribers' dismissing patients taking opioids from their practices [13] . In October 2019, the US Department of Health and Human Services published a guide warning clinicians against abruptly discontinuing or tapering patients from long-term opioid use [14, 15] .

The most commonly used strategies were targeted at individual providers, generally demonstrating modest effects, with considerable variability in effectiveness between studies. The authors found little use of implementation strategies targeted at organizations (e.g., the clinic) or a wider context (e.g., health systems). Finally, the review found very limited data on the costs and cost-effectiveness of different implementation strategies. The authors concluded that the literature remains unclear about which implementation strategies should be used under what conditions, and that future research should study implementation strategies targeted at levels broader than individual providers.",

Four clinics received systems consultation, and four clinics served as controls; see [18] for details. During the 6-month intervention period, the systems consultation implementation team (consisting of a physician expert and a practice facilitator) met with clinic staff in monthly site visits, videoconferences, or teleconferences. The systems consultation strategy generally proved to be feasible and acceptable: Attendance by clinic staff at intervention meetings was 83%, and more than 80% of intervention participants agreed or strongly agreed with the statements, \"I am more familiar with guidelines for safe opioid prescribing\" and \"My clinic's workflow for opioid prescribing is easier.\" In addition, systems consultation appeared to be effective: Compared with control clinics, intervention clinics reduced average morphinemilligram equivalent (MME) dose for patients on longterm opioid therapy by 19.7% over 12 months.",

We used participant observation, focus groups, interviews, and activity tracking to collect data used to follow implementation over time and explore what worked well and what required modification. Synthesizing these data and discussing them among research team members informed plans for the current study as follows. (1) The absence of a dedicated informational session at the health system level-i.e., a meeting designed to inform and engage participants on a wide scale-was a missed opportunity to (a) galvanize common support and engage all primary care clinics and health system leaders around the importance of guideline-concordant prescribing, and (b) introduce audit and feedback (a health-system-level strategy) to clinicians and frontline staff. In addition, the absence of an educational and engagement meeting also meant that (c) initial clinic visits often involved repeatedly explaining the rationale for systems consultation, leading to greater cost to and time burden on the implementation team. (2) Clinicians and frontline staff were better prepared to work on the activities that are part of PF (e.g., workflow changes) after receiving cliniclevel performance data supplied by AF reports, which summarized baseline performance and provided a vehicle for ongoing progress monitoring. (3) We developed a team-based implementation and engagement model using both a physician expert and a practice facilitator because it quickly became clear that assigning sole responsibility to the physician expert for advising, communicating, and coordinating with change teams (at the clinic) was overly burdensome and not scalable. We added a practice facilitator to support the physician expert at all monthly PF sessions and facilitate followup communications over the course of 6 months.",

(4) In three of four pilot clinics, we learned that clinicians and frontline staff charged with implementing new practices often lacked the time and skills to conduct organizational change projects and benefitted from monthly follow-up; yet in one of the four clinics, a single site visit led by a respected physician peer consultant was all that was needed to enact change, lessening the value of subsequent follow-up engagements. The case of this particular clinic gave us reason to believe that an effective educational and engagement meeting might be sufficient to effect positive change in some clinics, without the need for more intensive implementation support. (5) We observed that different clinics prioritized different focal problems that may be better addressed using different combinations of the implementation strategies. For example, regular urine drug screening can be addressed by PF; opioidbenzodiazepine co-prescribing can be addressed by PPC. (6) Candidate determinants of the success of different implementation strategies were identified across multiple levels: the existence of a related health system policy (at health system level), the overall size of the clinic panel and experience doing quality improvement work (at the clinic level), and the number of high-dose opioid patients and \"inherited\" opioid patients (at the prescriber level).",

We added an educational/engagement meeting (EM, with the option of receiving continuing medical education credits) as a complementary health system strategy alongside AF. Our experience with the pilot suggested the need for a sequenced approach to the strategies within systems consultation, whereby potentially more intensive strategies are offered only after providing less intensive strategies. In the current study, we operationalize this idea by first providing EM/AF to all clinics in a first stage of implementation, then considering whether to augment EM/AF with PF in a second stage of implementation, and then considering whether to augment with PPC in a third stage of implementation. This approach-considering whether to progress from broad organizational support via EM/AF (the least intensive set of strategies) to support for individual prescribers via PPC (the most intensive)-aligns well with existing multi-level frameworks guiding implementation [19, 22] (see Fig. 1 ). Finally, our experience also suggested the need to consider a tailored approach to delivering the strategies within systems consultation [23, 24] , whereby different clinics may be provided PF depending on their needs following EM/AF, and different clinics may be provided PPC depending on their needs following prior intervention (e.g., EM/AF followed by PF).",

At the end of month 9, we posit that those two factors plus two others are useful to consider in deciding whether to add PPC: (c) whether PF was offered at the end of month 3 and (d) number or percent of high-dose opioid patients at the end of month 9. Put another way, these factors are candidate moderators of the effect of the implementation strategies. We had also identified the existence of a health system's opioid prescribing policy as a candidate variable, but since both systems in the trial have such policies, the study offers no variation. Qualitative methods will be used to address two other important questions: (1) how the implementation strategies that make up systems consultation can be further specified, including adaptations made during the trial, and (2) whether a quantitative assessment can be developed to help decision-makers tailor systems consultation to different contexts. A tailoring assessment will be developed, based on a literature review and the findings of the pilot study [18, 21] , to assess whether other system-, clinic-, and prescriber-level contextual factors also ought to be considered as tailoring variables in the decisions concerning whether to offer PF and PPC.

The sample size calculator for this comparison is a straightforward adjustment to the sample size calculator for a standard two-sample hypothesis test. The adjustment accounts for the clustering of prescribers within clinics through a variance inflation factor (VIF) of 1 + (m \u2212 1) \u03c1, where m is the (average) number of prescribers per clinic and \u03c1 is inter-clinic correlation coefficient (ICC) for MME at month 21 (t = 18).

Assuming an average of m = 6 prescribers per clinic (based on information from the new health systems that have agreed to participate), a Type-1 error rate of \u03b1 = 5% and \u03c1 = 0.14, a minimum of 64 prescribers in each group (11 clinics per group) will provide at least 80% power to detect a moderate effect size of d = 2/3 between the two implementation sequences on change in MME.

Whereas health economic evaluation provides information primarily for policymakers, engineering economic analysis produces information primarily for the organizational leaders who ultimately make decisions about the adoption of evidence-based practices in their organizations. We adopt the perspective of the healthcare system (rather than society at large) in considering the incremental costs and effects associated with ratcheting up the implementation strategy. This perspective deemphasizes some societal costs (e.g., patient travel time) and effects (e.g., crime related to addiction) that are often considered in traditional cost-effectiveness analysis [38] . However, the health system perspective aligns with updated guidelines for cost-effectiveness that were re-issued in 2016 [39] that acknowledge the importance of the health care perspective for pragmatic purposes. The health systems we will work with, like many health systems, are Accountable Care Organizations, which means that they are responsible for their patients' total cost of care.

Detailed logs were kept of all contacts between members of the research team and the clinic change teams to estimate the number of hours spent delivering systems consultation. These estimates were multiplied by hourly wage rates for physician consultants and the facilitators. Costs for clinic incentives (continuing education credits, clinic stipends) and expenses associated with site visits were also included in the cost assessment. The total cost of delivering the entire systems consultation implementation strategy for 6 months (i.e., the full package of strategies corresponding to box D in Fig. 2 ) was estimated in the pilot research. The log-based costing approach is sufficiently fine-grained to construct detailed breakdowns of unit costs associated with each component (EM/AF, PF, and PPC) of the full systems consultation intervention [18] .",

Implementation costs will be organized using the Cost of Implementing New Strategies framework [38] and categorized under the \"Implementation\" domain of RE-AIM (see Table 1 ). Secondary ICERs will include incremental cost per unit change in prevalence of opioid/benzodiazepine co-prescribing, completion of treatment agreements, urine drug screens, and so on, as shown in Table  1 .

The literature offers virtually no guidance on which implementation strategies are most effective in different clinical contexts. This study collects data that can be used to empirically develop a multi-level, adaptive, scalable implementation strategy called systems consultation, which is a blend of discrete implementation strategies. The goal of the study is to understand the optimal sequencing and combination of implementation strategies that specific types of clinics and prescribers need to adopt clinical guidelines for opioid prescribing. Specifically, we will test four different sequences and combinations of strategies (EM/AF, EM/AF + PF, EM/AF + PPC, and EM/AF + PF + PPC) to assess the effectiveness and cost of augmenting a systems-level, broadly based implementation strategy (EM/AF) with progressively more intensive strategies.",

The pragmatic trial we propose may be generalized to other regions of the USA struggling with prescription opioids, and potentially to other significant public health issues. Results of the study, when combined with results from other trials also focusing on adaptive implementation strategies, will increase our knowledge of how to tailor implementation strategies to different settings, ultimately increasing the speed and efficiency of delivering evidence-based practices into health systems.",
