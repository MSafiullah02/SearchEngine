Many pathogens have been reported to cause respiratory infections; however, viruses are considered the main cause, accounting for 40%\u201350% of infections in hospitalized children in developing countries (Simoes et al., 2006, Comach et al., 2012, Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010). The most commonly reported virus is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Al-Romaihi et al., 2019, Krilov, 2001). Other common viruses include influenza A (IAV) and B viruses (IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, and human rhinovirus (HRV) (Monto, 2002, Williams et al., 2002, Pavia, 2011). Additionally, several new viruses have been also found to manifest clinically as influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and human bocavirus (HboV) (Pavia, 2011, Debiaggi et al., 2012, Walker et al., 2013). Importantly, until now, most of these respiratory viruses have no approved vaccines or medications (Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010).",

These three viruses were the main causing agents of respiratory illnesses in almost two-thirds of admitted children. We found that HRV was positive in nearly a quarter of all cases, and was predominating over other infections throughout the six-year period. Similar to our findings, HRV was reported to cause the highest percentage of ILI in children in different countries, as recently reported by Taylor et al. (Taylor et al., 2017). However, they reported higher prevalence (41.5% out of 6266 cases), probably because they enrolled children aged ten years or younger only, whereas our study included children below 15 years old, noting that HRV is more prevalent among younger age groups. In compliance with our results, a large national surveillance study from Korea (n\n = 36,915) showed that HRV was predominantly the leading cause of ARIs, with a percentage that decreased from 19% in children below 5 years, to 12% among those aged between 6 and 19 years (Kim et al., 2018). Contrarily, other studies reported lower HRV frequencies, probably due to the smaller sample size (Otomaru et al., 2015).",

Generally, both IAV and IBV were co-circulating in all seasons, with a noticeable dominance of IAV, except in 2016, where IBV was more prevalent. This high circulation of IBV in the 2016 season has also been reported in other studies (AlIbrahim et al., 2019, Simms et al., 2017). It could be explained by a mismatch between the circulating IBV lineage, and the administered trivalent influenza vaccine used in that season as reported from Lebanon (AlIbrahim et al., 2019). Importantly, despite the availability of quadrivalent vaccines that overcome this issue, young children are typically given a trivalent vaccine, which has only one IBV lineage.",

            "text": "Circulation of influenza viruses showed a clear primary peak between November and December, which is consistent with reports from regions with a similar climate (Caini et al., 2018). Additionally, we observed another minor peak around April, which is interestingly similar to what has been reported in Northern Hemisphere countries (Caini et al., 2018). We also found that RSV and HMPV circulate simultaneously with influenza while HRV was primarily active during low RSV and influenza activity, which is similar to previous reports (Njouom et al., 2012, Haynes et al., 2016, Razanajatovo et al., 2011, Nguyen et al., 2016). While many studies failed to determine HRV seasonality (Taylor et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2016), our data indicated a noticeable seasonal activity during early fall at the time of school opening in Qatar, followed by another peak around March. Likewise, infections with adenovirus and M. pneumonia tend to raise at the time of low RSV and influenza circulation. Adenovirus usually does not exhibit a discernible seasonal circulation pattern; however, similar to our results, the increase in virus transmission around May has been previously reported (G\u00fclen et al., 2014). We also found that HboV displayed a consistent increase during late winter/early spring in most of the years, in line with reports from Iran and South Africa (Tabasi et al., 2016, Schildgen et al., 2008). We also found that the overall seasonality of PIVs was ambiguous and lacked any specific circulation trends. However, late fall and early winter exhibited higher PIVs cases, especially with PIV type 3 and 4. Contrarily, according to the CDC, PIV-1 and PIV-2 circulate more commonly during fall, PIV-3 occur frequently in spring and summer, while PIV-4 circulate without any seasonal occurrence (Human Parainfluenza Viruses, 2017). On the other hand, HCoVs were more prevalent in winter, typical of other respiratory viruses. Yet, positive cases were also reported during warm months confirming other reports (Soonnarong et al., 2016, Gaunt et al., 2010). Finally, parechovirus infections were scattered throughout the years, with no temporal patterns, although previous records indicated higher activity between fall and winter (Chiang et al., 2017). This is probably due to the low infection rates reported in our study. In fact, the variation in the reported viruses\u2019 seasonality could possible result from the sampling bias that exists in most retrospective studies, in which more specimens are usually collected during the winter months.",

Given the large number of enrolled patients, this is the largest scale report on ILIs among children in the MENA region to the best of our knowledge. Information obtained from this study shall have important implications on infections\u2019 control and prevention policies, particularly for public health authorities and health systems. For instance, results would help in launching prevention and control programs such as vaccine campaigns according to the country-specific pathogens\u2019 seasonality. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these vaccine and awareness campaigns could be improved by prioritizing high-risk groups with higher infection burden. This epidemiologic study can also improve the diagnosis strategy by providing data about the causes of ILIs in the country, and hence, help in improving the selection of pathogens for regular clinical testing. Nonetheless, future studies that include patients\u2019 vaccination records and clinical symptoms are still needed to understand the clinical significance and the vaccine coverage of respiratory diseases in Qatari population.",
