In many children the clinical presentation is striking and KD patients are often misdiagnosed with severe sepsis. However, KD can have similar clinical features to other common childhood illnesses, such as measles, rubella and scarlet fever. These children may present a diagnostic challenge6 and the lack of a specific diagnostic test may delay treatment and thus worsen prognosis.7\n",

A better descriptive term is \u2018incomplete KD\u2019 because these children do not demonstrate atypical signs, just fewer of them. Cervical lymphadenopathy is the least commonly observed of the diagnostic criteria, occurring in about three quarters of usually older children, whilst prolonged fever and peripheral desquamation have been reported as the commonest diagnostic features. Incomplete KD may be poorly recognised and occurs more often in infants.8 Children presenting with incomplete KD are at higher risk of developing coronary artery lesions both because of their young age and their potential for not receiving timely immunoglobulin treatment.8 Interestingly, as many as 10% of the children reported in the original report of the syndrome2 would not fulfil the current case definition.3 The clinical diagnostic criteria need refinement to increase their positive predictive value and recent guidelines have been developed in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis.5 It is unclear how these will perform in clinical practice. Although these guidelines are intended only as a clinical tool, they are likely to have an impact on the reported epidemiology of KD.",

Acute mortality in KD is increased significantly, with deaths predominantly occurring from myocardial infarction following occlusion of giant coronary aneurysms.11, 12 Overall, myocardial infarction occurs in \u223c2% of those with coronary artery lesions.13 Lifelong medical therapy, coronary artery grafting and even heart transplantation may be required.1 Crucially, in children without coronary artery lesions who die of other causes, the coronary arteries are almost invariably markedly abnormal, with striking pro-atherosclerotic changes.14, 15 Abnormal in vivo function in non-coronary arteries16 suggests that cardiovascular damage post-KD is both pervasive and persistent, even in the absence of acute coronary artery lesions. Thus, there is intense speculation that KD is pro-atherosclerotic, but definitive long-term data are lacking.",

A transient immunological immaturity may also account for the low incidence in the first few months postnatally.29 The low incidence of KD beyond mid-childhood suggest a ubiquitous antigen(s) that most children encounter uneventfully in early childhood and to which they mount an appropriate and protective immune response.

The list of discarded and/or unproven etiological agents in KD is long (Table 3). A recent report of an association between the presence of genetic material from a novel coronavirus and Kawasaki disease in a handful of cases48 remains unproven and may reflect an epiphenomenon; the putative etiological agent is a relatively common viral pathogen in young children and it is unclear how long the DNA persists. The lack of a unifying etiological agent despite a significant research effort suggests that KD can follow exposure to more than one infectious agent, or that a novel infectious agent is involved.

In one small study, maternal antibodies against toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 appeared protective against early-onset KD.52 However, the carriage rates of superantigen-producing bacteria by children with KD are not consistently increased,53, 54 although these data may reflect the involvement of as yet unidentified superantigens, with more than one superantigen capable of causing KD. Superantigens bind to the V\u03b2 region of the T-cell receptor and clonal expansion of V\u03b22-expressing T-cells has been reported in some studies of KD,55 but again the finding is inconsistent.56 Other studies have reported oligoclonal IgA-producing plasma cells infiltrating bronchial and intestinal tissues in fatal KD,57 which suggests the involvement of a conventional antigen.",

Certainly the epidemiology of KD, with rapid changes in incidence, seasonal variation and the relationship between incidence and weather conditions is more redolent of acute viral infections58, 59 than bacterial colonisation, which alters more slowly.60 In meningococcal disease, influenza infection acts in an analogous way, and meningococcal epidemics often follow influenza outbreaks.61, 62 This hypothesis could be addressed through large detailed prospective epidemiological studies.",

Many studies focus on putative downstream outcome determinants and suggest a role for mediators of innate inflammation,84 endothelial activation85 and cardiovascular homeostasis.86 Studies of susceptibility determinants are more limited. There are associations with class I regions of the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) in Japanese,87 with different alleles associated in Caucasians.88 However, these HLA studies are largely historical and further work using modern HLA typing techniques are warranted.",

It is the most common cause of heart disease acquired in childhood and an important paradigm for understanding the determinants of adult cardiovascular pathology. The epidemiology is well characterised and clearly supports the view that the disease results from an inappropriate immunological response to one or more infectious triggers in genetically-susceptible individuals. The search for the microbial etiology has been disappointing and unsuccessful and all that remains of over three decades of such studies is a \u2018long list of discarded pathogens\u2019.3 Understanding the genetic determinants of susceptibility to KD and those involved in mediating coronary artery damage may be a more profitable approach. The methodological issues that have undermined genetic analyses can be largely overcome by international collaborative studies that employ standardised phenotypic definitions and large sample sizes derived from different ethnic groups. The use of family-based genetic association analyses95 circumvents the problems of population stratification and the use of trans-racial mapping (i.e. investigating genetic determinants in different ethnic groups)96 may prove important to defining the critical genetic determinants, particularly in regions of high linkage disequilibrium. Newer molecular techniques, particularly gene expression profiling and proteomics may identify novel molecular \u2018fingerprints\u2019 that differentiate KD from other febrile and inflammatory illnesses.3 The mystery of KD may ultimately be solved by looking within the host.",
