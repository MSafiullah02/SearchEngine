            "text": "An ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has exhibited significant threats to international health and economy. COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-Cov-2.1 The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-Cov-2 are bats,2 but it is believed that the virus transmitted from animal to human by some intermediated animal host. In China, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province at Dec,2019.3 The first series of patients in Wuhan with conformed COVID-19 worked or lived around the local Huanan seafood wholesale market,4 selling wild animals as well. Shortly after that, infected patients exploded without contact history of the market.5 The number of COVID-19 globally were 76769 till Feb 21, 2020, including 75569 patients in China.6 Unfortunately, no target treatment for this virus has been proved until now. We cannot totally know of this virus and its related diseases COVID-19. Therefore, this severe infectious disease garnered great research interest. Previous clinical studies revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infected patients of special population7 or series cases.8, 9, 10, 11 They focused on general clinical characteristics and laboratory results of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Meanwhile, several studies reported the damaged immunity system caused by SARS-Cov-2 and a significant decrease of lymphocyte in blood routine examination. But no research focused on the T lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19. In a general way, immune system is the first to be affected with virus infection. It has been confirmed that coronavirus infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndromes (MERS) play important roles in immunity system injury. The T-cell and B-cell immunity may predict the disease severe level of coronavirus infection as well as the clinical outcomes.12 T lymphocyte plays a vital role in cell-mediated and humoral immunity.13 T lymphocyte includes CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells (helper T cells) and CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells, or killer T cells), natural killer (NK) cells and B cells, which can only recognize protein-based receptor-bound antigens. From Dec 26, 2019 to now, we included over hundreds of patients with conformed COVID-19. We are one of the hospitals which primary diagnosed and treated COVID-19 patients and reported this new infectious disease to Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at first. In clinical practice, we find that most patients showed significant changes of T lymphocyte subset and several inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we are interested in the relationship between T lymphocyte subset and in-hospital death and severity of illness among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In this study, we focus on the suppressed T lymphocyte subsets and increased inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we measured the association of T lymphocyte subsets and in-hospital death as well as the severity of COVID-19.",

            "text": "T cell-mediated immunity is the central element of the adaptive immune system and includes a primary response by na\u00efve T cells. Each T lymphocyte expresses a unique T cell receptor (TCR) on the surface.14 Mature T lymphocytes known as na\u00efve T cells, circulate through blood and the lymphatic system and reside in secondary lymphoid organs.15 All T lymphocytes have the T-cell receptor (TCR) and pan-T-cell co-receptor CD3. CD4+ T cells recognize MHC 1 bound antigens, while CD8+ T cells recognize the MHC 1 bound antigens. Both CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells have the co-receptor CD3. And the sum total counts of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ cells are almost equal to or slightly more than CD3+ cells. Damage to T lymphocytes, impressed immunity and related high levels of inflammatory cytokines might be important factor to exacerbation and mortality of patients. Previous SARS-COV infection stimulated cytokines IL-1, IL-10 etc., and T lymphocyte subsets CD4+T-cell and CD8+T-cell were decreased after onset of the disease as well.16 T-cell mediated immunity is an adaptive process of developing antigen-(Ag) specific T lymphocytes to eliminate SARS-COV-2 invasion. Since CD4+ T cells are central in the origin and regulation of autoimmunity, emphasis has been placed on the characterization of Th subsets and their possible roles in the inflammatory process. IL-1\u03b2 serves as the major mediator of inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune, infectious and degenerative ones. In the central nervous system (CNS), it acts as endogenous pyrogen inducing fever, and systemically, it induces the acute phase response, either directly or indirectly via the induction of IL-6 production. IL-6 is one of the key mediators regulating inflammation. Upon activation by infectious agents like SARS-COV-2, IL-6 is produced by macrophages, endothelial cells, and T cells and activate many tissue cells, including endothelial cells and parenchymal cells to produce effector molecules of inflammation.17 IL-10 is mainly produced by monocytes and T cells and the most potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, which reduces inflammatory processes and thus limits collateral inflammation-induced tissue damage.18\n,\n19 On one hand, SARS-COV-2 invasion activated T cell-mediated immunity which resulted in increasing production of inflammatory cytokine. However, inhibition cytokines such as IL-10 can suppress T cell activation conversely. On the other hand, SAA and CRP are both of acute-phase proteins in response to inflammatory cytokines related by activated monocytes/macrophages after infections. High levels of SAA and CRP could reflect the severity of inflammation and result in a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, during which inflammation spreads throughout the body via the circulation. Several studies revealed that a substantial decrease in total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body's cellular immune function.20\n,\n21 SARS causes similar decrease of T lymphocyte, severe lung injury and spleen shrinkage, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).22, 23, 24 Until now, no antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. Now, we faced on urgent need to elucidate what are the risk factors for severe illness or death. Therefore, our study tries to partly answer this question to help with the clinical practice and better know this disease.",
