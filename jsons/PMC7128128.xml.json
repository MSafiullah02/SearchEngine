Saudi Arabia has been most severely affected so far, but imported cases\u2014either recent travellers or those transported for clinical care\u2014have been seen in countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. Major nosocomial outbreaks have happened in the Middle East,3 and non-sustained human-to-human transmission events elsewhere,4 and many more clinical cases are likely to have occurred.5 There has been a recent surge in case reporting that could be the result of more human-to-human transmissions due to a change in exposure patterns, expansion of the virus in animal reservoir(s), seasonal variation, ongoing nosocomial clusters, or increased surveillance with reporting of mild or asymptomatic MERS-CoV detections, or both.5\n",

Despite more than 500 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases so far, only a handful of patients have had systematic virological and biomarker sampling.4, 6 Consequently, there are many unanswered questions regarding sites of infection, pathogen dynamics, innate and adaptive immune responses, and host genetic factors. Prolonged viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, extrapulmonary virus detection, severe lung injury with respiratory failure, and often renal failure are notable features, suggesting that an effective antiviral regimen, perhaps in combination with immunomodulatory agents, would provide clinical benefit.",

An absence of good animal models for MERS-CoV poses a major challenge. Many agents have inhibitory activity in vitro for coronaviruses, including some licensed drugs,7, 8, 9 but it is unclear whether their human pharmacology and tolerability would enable sufficient doses to be given to exert antiviral effects in patients with MERS-CoV. One available drug that is inhibitory for coronaviruses in vitro at clinically achievable levels is the inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor mycophenolic acid,8 but animal data for this effect are scarce, and one patient developed infection while receiving mycophenolate mofetil.4 Ribavirin and interferon combinations are associated with modest antiviral effects in MERS-CoV inoculated rhesus macaques given high doses.9 Although the clinical relevance of these findings is uncertain, the combined use of antiviral drugs to enhance inhibitory effects and reduce the potential for resistance emergence makes sense.",

Additionally, the availability of human neutralising monoclonal antibodies12 or polyclonal immune globulin produced in transgenic cows or other hosts13 could overcome these hurdles. The high seroprevalence of high-titre neutralising antibody to MERS-CoV or a closely related virus in dromedary camels in the region raises the possibility of using camel sera or engineered single domain camel antibodies for therapy.13, 14 Purified immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments (nanobodies) might offer a therapeutic option for severely ill patients until more defined, genetically engineered, antibodies become available.",

Furthermore, working with colleagues in Public Health England, ISARIC experts have examined available data and ranked potential therapeutic options with regard to their priority for clinical study;10 this information will be updated as new data become available.",

Clinicians and public health officials in affected Middle Eastern countries, particularly in Saudi Arabia, are uniquely positioned to undertake such studies. With support as needed from international partners like WHO and ISARIC,11 regional governments, and funders, Middle Eastern colleagues have both the opportunity and the responsibility to undertake studies to advance the understanding of effective prevention and treatment strategies for MERS-CoV and any future novel CoV outbreaks.
