Because some of these SARS-CoV inhibitors and other commercially available antiviral agents might be promising candidates for controlling and treating FCoV infection in cats, we carried out the present study and successfully identified two compounds that act effectively against a recently isolated FCoV strain. We found that the combined use of these agents shows a synergistic antiviral effect.",

Next, we sought to determine whether the compounds are effective at postentry steps in an environment of high viral load, as found in FIP cats (Kipar et al., 2006). To mimic the target cells present in the tissue of diseased animals, we preinfected cells before treating them with the antiviral compounds. The fcwf-4 cells were infected at a MOI 0.1 (20,000 PFU/mL), and the cells were then treated with either one or both antiviral compounds for 48 h. MTT and plaque assays were simultaneously performed to examine the cell damage caused by viral replication and the presence of infectious virus in the culture supernatant. Despite a lack of significant cell damage at 48 h postinoculation (Supplementary data 1), the results of the plaque assay revealed that treatment with either GNA or nelfinavir alone at their highest concentrations, 0.48 nM and 9.41 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 4\nand supplementary data 2) did not completely inhibit FCoV replication. However, a synergistic antiviral effect was observed when both agents were added simultaneously. FCoV replication was completely blocked under six combinations, i.e., nelfinavir (9.41 \u03bcM) and GNA (0.12\u20130.48 nM), or nelfinavir (6.27\u20139.41 \u03bcM) and GNA (0.48 nM) (Fig. 4 and supplementary data 2).

            "text": "When tested on cells infected at a low concentration of FCoV, nelfinavir and GNA proved to be effective at inhibiting viral replication. Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease with strong in vivo activity. This drug is safe and widely used in HIV-infected patients (Lewis et al., 1997). The antiviral effect of nelfinavir against coronaviruses has been investigated in SARS-CoV infection (Yamamoto et al., 2004). Similar to the finding that nelfinavir inhibits SARS-CoV strain FFM-1, this compound was found to significantly block replication of FCoV. The IC50 of nelfinavir on SARS-CoV was 0.048 \u03bcM. This concentration appears to be lower than on our FCoV (8.19 \u03bcM). The difference in efficacy might result from low amino acid sequence homology (44%) of the two viruses (SARS-CoV FRA, GenBank accession number: AY310120; FCoV NTU156, accession number: GQ152141) in the putative 3C-like protease (3CLpro), i.e., the target molecule of nelfinavir. Furthermore, of the 18 residues in 3CLpro of SARS-CoV that have been identified to interact with several HIV protease inhibitors including nelfinavir (Rajnarayanan et al., 2004), only 7 were identical to the corresponding residues of 3CLpro of FCoV. This might also be the main factor that contributes to the high SI data of Nelfinavir on SARS-CoV in comparison to FCoV besides the difference of cells used in both assays. Our clinical trials using nelfinavir as a mean to control FCoV infection revealed that no obviously side effects, e.g., diarrhea or nausea, as occasionally seen in human HIV patients taking this agent, was observed in the 9 clinical healthy FCoV-shedding cats receiving the dosage 6.25 mg to 50 mg/kg/day per os. These preliminary findings raise a hope for using it in future clinical practice. This is the first study to demonstrate that an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease activity can effectively block the replication of an FCoV.",

Therefore, we also examined the antiviral effect of these compounds at postentry steps in cells preinoculated with high concentrations of virus (MOI 0.1) in order to mimic the environment of infected cells inside the body of a FIP cat. Under these conditions, the two effective compounds lost their anti-FCoV activity when used by themselves. This was surprising, given that the antiviral effect of nelfinavir has been demonstrated at the postentry step of SARS-CoV infection (Yamamoto et al., 2004). The antiviral activity of nelfinavir could not be assayed further due to the cytotoxicity of the compound at higher concentrations (Table 1). The fact that GNA lost its antiviral effect in cells preinoculated with FCoV was not unexpected because this compound works primarily at the step of viral attachment (Keyaerts et al., 2007).

For cases of FIP diagnosed early, the administration of effective antiviral agents may provide a chance to prevent secondary viremia, which triggers the fatal stage of this disease. As systemic application of GNA might provoke antibody responses leading to inactivity of the compound, and the primary antibody response generally appears about 2 weeks after the antigen stimulation (Murphy et al., 2008), the future therapeutic protocol will need to be designed to administer GNA in an efficient dose within the first 2 weeks, together with other effective antiviral agents like nelfinavir found in this study and some others currently under testing. With proper combination of effective agents targeting at different stages of viral replication, a cocktail therapy like treating HIV human patients may be available in the near future for cats suffering from FIP. The known side effect for nelfinavir is mild diarrhea, as previously observed in HIV patients (Kaldor et al., 1997), whereas no side effects for GNA have been reported.",
