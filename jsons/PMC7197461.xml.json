            "text": "Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), the type species of the genus Aquabirnavirus within the family Birnaviridae, is composed of a single\u2010shelled capsid enclosing two linear segments of double\u2010stranded RNA (Dobos 1995). The larger segment A encodes a polyprotein containing a protease, VP4, that auto\u2010catalytically liberates the two structural proteins, the precursor of the coat protein VP2 (Duncan, Nagy, Krell & Dobos 1987) and the core protein VP3 (Hjalmarsson, Carlemalm & Everitt 1999). A second overlapping open reading frame encodes a protein denoted VP5, the role of which is not yet fully understood (Hong, Gong & Wu 2002; Santi, Sandtr\u00f8, Sindre, Song, Hong, Thu, Wu, Vakharia & Evensen 2005b; Santi, Song, Vakharia & Evensen 2005a). The viral polymerase, and likewise the genome\u2010linked primer, is encoded by segment B (Dobos 1995). IPNV is a serious pathogen and threat to the commercial aquaculture industry and continues to spread into new fish farms causing substantial economic losses (Rodriguez Saint\u2010Jean, Borrego & Perez\u2010Prieto 2003). When first isolated, IPNV was considered to be a reovirus based on the nature of the viral genome (Moss & Gravell 1969), but further insights into virion structure placed it within a new taxonomic family (Dobos, Hill, Hallett, Kells, Becht & Teninges 1979) that was approved by the ICTV in 1986 (Brown 1986). When quantifying the amount of purified IPNV in solution by UV readings, the relationship originally determined for reoviruses is still employed, despite differences in protein and nucleic acid composition (Smith, Zweerink & Joklik 1969; Dobos, Hallett, Kells, Sorensen & Rowe 1977; Dobos et al. 1979).",

This ability could be a reflection of the concept of metastability, referring to the property of viral capsids to remain intact and protect the viral genome during the extracellular phase until entry into a susceptible cell where subsequent uncoating is pivotal for virus replication. Documented factors influencing virion integrity are fluctuations in temperature, ionic concentration and pH (Witz & Brown 2001; Johnson 2003). IPNV entry occurs via receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis (Couve, Kiss & Kuznar 1992; Kuznar, Soler, Farias & Espinoza 1995; Granzow, Weiland, Fichtner & Enzmann 1997), but unlike many other viruses, it does not require an acidic pH to exit the endosome (Espinoza & Kuznar 1997).",

            "text": "The majority of glycosylated proteins carry N\u2010linked glycosylation, a post\u2010translational modification that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Less abundant are structural viral proteins with an O\u2010linked modification. However, the adenovirus fibre, responsible for cellular recognition and attachment (Philipson, Lonberg\u2010Holm & Pettersson 1968; Ishibashi & Maizel 1974) and the coat protein of IPNV, VP2 are both glycosylated in an O\u2010linked fashion (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999). The significance of this post\u2010translational modification of the replicative cycle of IPNV is not known. The M protein of the envelope of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus is invariably O\u2010glycosylated, and it is not important for virulence or replication (de Haan, de Wit, Kuo, Montalto, Masters, Weiss & Rottier 2002). The multifaceted large T\u2010antigen of the polyomavirus SV40, essential for viral gene regulation and expression, is O\u2010glycosylated in the region important for the nuclear localization signal, retinoblastoma recognition and viral replication (Medina, Grove & Haltiwanger 1998; Ahuja, Saenz\u2010Robles & Pipas 2005). O\u2010glycosylated nucleocytoplasmic proteins have also been implemented in signal transduction events and as such would influence protein\u2013protein interactions (Wells, Vosseller & Hart 2001). This raises an interesting question on the possible functional interplay between mutual phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. In view of the broad spectrum of the events dependent on O\u2010linked glycosylation, it would be of interest to investigate whether the O\u2010linked glycosylation in IPNV has any impact on, e.g. virion stability and viral infectivity.",

However, this latter method is laborious and time\u2010consuming, and it is not used on a routine basis.

Following these treatments, virions were sedimented in glycerol gradients under calculated conditions where intact virions would migrate to the centre of the tubes. As controls of sedimentation, starting material in TNE and virions mock\u2010treated only in the phosphate buffer were also included. The sedimentation profiles showed that mere transfer of virions into the acidic phosphate buffer (mock series) and the prolonged incubation at 37 \u00b0C caused the virions to disassemble as revealed by some aggregates sedimenting onto the high\u2010density cushion and also leaving slowly migrating capsid components on top of the gradients (Fig. 1). It also became apparent that virions stored in TNE spontaneously disaggregated as revealed by slowly sedimenting material of low molecular weight remaining on top of the gradients (Fig. 1d). Such material contained both RNA and protein of approximately the same relative amounts as in intact virions and would correspond to released core structures and capsid proteins (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999). Infectivity titrations were performed on pooled fractions from the virion positions in the middle of the gradients as well as from aggregated material. The same amounts of radioactivity from all series were assayed, and infectivity yields of the enzyme\u2010treated series were compared with the TNE control and the mock series. Only minor differences were revealed, indicating no effect of the O\u2010glycosidase and as anticipated also a lack of effect in the negative control series. Among the aggregates, some infectivity was detected; however, only for the negative control series. Thus, any O\u2010glycosidic enzyme effect on virion stability and viral infectivity could not be deduced from this type of experimental set\u2010up.",

Therefore, it was important to keep radiolabelled viruses intact and infectious under storage conditions at 4 \u00b0C because we wanted to avoid freezing and thawing of the virus. To investigate this further, an alternative buffer system was developed. Equal amounts of freshly purified IPNV in CsCl were directly transferred into two different buffer systems, TNE and a stabilizing SB\u2010buffer, by employing the Zeba\u2122 Desalt Spin Column technique. The samples were subjected to 10 cycles of freeze\u2010thawing; after each step, aliquots were removed for UV\u2010spectrum analysis, and after steps 2, 7 and 10, samples were withdrawn for infectivity titration. UV\u2010spectra revealed constant and overlapping profiles for virions maintained in the SB system, whereas data for virions in TNE fluctuated, indicating difficulties in removing representative 2 \u03bcL samples for spectrometry because of possible freeze\u2010thawing\u2010induced aggregation (not shown). Infectivity titration data showed that after the tenth freezing, the infectivity dropped by four orders of magnitude for viruses in TNE, whereas in the SB\u2010system infectivity was essentially maintained and was reduced only by a factor of approximately 5.5 (Fig. 2). However, as a novel observation, virions retained stability and infectivity for prolonged periods of time at 4 \u00b0C in SB as compared with the conventional TNE buffer system (compare Fig. 1d).",

In a reproducible manner, it was observed that 1 mm of periodate kept a majority of the virions intact, whereas increasing concentrations of the oxidant first caused virion disruption leaving slower migrating material on top of the gradients.

This is based on the fact that rate\u2010zonal centrifugation isolation of virion cores \u2013 RNA stoichiometrically complexed with VP3 \u2013 recovered from hypotonically disrupted virions will require six times higher g \u00d7 hours forces in runs on shallow sucrose gradients as compared to the present runs on steep glycerol gradients (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999).Then, upon exposure to concentrations between 25 and 50 mm, virions aggregated quantitatively and were recovered as fast sedimenting material on the high\u2010density cushions of CsCl (Fig. 4).

The UV\u2010absorption data obtained according to Kalb & Bernlohr (1977) were further shown to produce protein content values close to the chemical method that gives equal results irrespective of the amino acid composition of the proteins analysed (Dorsey et al. 1977).

These observations were consistent throughout the studies when virus preparations were stored in the TNE buffer system. Furthermore, a total disaggregation of purified virions of IPNV is provoked by dialysis against buffers of 5 mm Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.1 and 0.2 mm EDTA (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999). This behaviour could be a reflection of the biological fact that most non\u2010enveloped viruses are characterized by their properties of metastability (Witz & Brown 2001; Johnson 2003). The human adenovirus type 2 further exemplifies the fragility of purified non\u2010enveloped viruses. This virus disrupts readily upon dialysis against hypotonic buffers of pH < 6.5 (Prage, Pettersson, H\u00f6glund, Lonberg\u2010Holm & Philipson 1970). This effect is partially counteracted by physiological concentrations of sodium chloride and it is almost fully inhibited in the presence of any protein, such as bovine serum albumin, that non\u2010specifically adheres to the virions. Interestingly, because of hydrophobic interactions, these protective effects are further enhanced in the presence of non\u2010ionic detergents such as Tween 20 (Everitt, de Luca & Blixt 1992). Not only the property to completely disaggregate under small changes of the environmental conditions in vitro should be considered \u2013 as seen here \u2013 but also the possibility of \u2018particle breathing\u2019, meaning slight conformational changes of the whole virion leading to the exposure of different immunological epitopes and otherwise hidden structural residues because of changes in pH and ionic strength of buffers. Such virion behaviour is seen in the poliovirus system where the N\u2010terminal region of VP1 under certain conditions is retained at the interior of the capsid as revealed by X\u2010ray crystallography, whereas infectious virus in suspension can be precipitated by antibodies against the N\u2010terminal part (Roivainen, Piirainen, Rysa, Narvanen & Hovi 1993). Further, electron microscopy of polioviruses stained with phosphotungstic acid under different temperatures and ionic concentrations displays altered diameters of the capsid, which in turn are mirrored by different periods of time needed for the chemical agent N\u2010acetyl\u2010ethyleneimine to penetrate and inactivate the virus (Burrage, Kramer & Brown 2000). The entry mechanisms of non\u2010enveloped viruses are still quite elusive. Many non\u2010enveloped viruses have an internal structure, often an integral part of the capsid protein, which is referred to as a membrane\u2010active peptide. It has the equivalent function of the fusion peptides in enveloped viruses with the difference that the former cause membrane disruption to allow for virion entry and/or a simultaneous uncoating instead of membrane fusion. This membrane\u2010active protein is hidden during the extracellular phase and needs to be activated in some viral systems by a cleavage event (Zhang, Jin, Fang, Hui & Zhou 2010), and it is exposed during the early phase of infection induced by receptor binding or alterations in the physical environment such as temperature, ionic strength or a lowering of pH (Banerjee & Johnson 2008). To a certain degree, these conformational changes are reversible and account for the observed \u2018capsid breathing\u2019. A membrane\u2010active domain responsible for membrane destabilization with subsequent entry and uncoating has not been identified for IPNV, but it is likely that such an activity would be located to VP2. It is possible that the observed virion instability in TNE could induce such \u2018capsid breathing\u2019 exposing a membrane destabilizing part of VP2. Further studies are needed to verify if this is the case and to identify the mechanism that allows IPNV to escape the endosomal vesicles and release the viral genome.",

However, as the buffer subsequently required for optimal O\u2010glycosidase enzymatic activity called for a change into the low\u2010ionic\u2010strength phosphate buffer of low pH, the SB had to be replaced prior to enzymatic exposure of virions. The Zeba\u2122 desalt spin columns were employed for quantitative and rapid recovery of samples, and using unlabelled virions in the presence of 3H\u2010labelled glycerol, it was shown that with a starting concentration of 5% glycerol in the SB system, the eluted sample would contain a maximum of 0.003% glycerol and now in the alternative buffer.

Exposure of IPNV to 50 mm phosphate buffers demonstrated the instability of this virus when merely encountering low\u2010ionic\u2010strength conditions and incubations at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h. Thus, apart from following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, the idea was also that at this low\u2010ionic\u2010strength condition some sort of \u2018capsid breathing\u2019 could be induced, thereby exposing alternative sites for the O\u2010glycosidase treatment. We also included the procedure of pretreating the viruses with neuraminidase prior to exposure to the O\u2010glycosidase.

The lack of enzymatic effect on intact virions, as also seen by the full recognition of VP2 in subsequent lectin blots (not shown), prompted us to employ the established method of chemical oxidation of carbohydrate residues by treatment with periodate. Periodate oxidizes adjacent hydroxyl groups on carbohydrates without affecting the proteins at low pH (Woodward, Young & Bloodgood 1985; Martinez\u2010Barragan & del Angel 2001). However, a possible effect on the amino acid residues, e.g. serine, threonine and cysteine cannot be totally excluded (Dreesman & Suriano 1976; Shraishi, Shirachi, Ishida & Sekine 1978). Periodate oxidation of adenovirus types 7 and 14 reduces the haemagglutinating activity against rhesus monkey red blood cells with a parallel loss of infectivity (Dreesman & Suriano 1976; Ogier et al. 1994). Likewise, a reduction in infectivity of more than six orders of magnitude is seen upon periodate treatment of adenovirus type 5 (Ogier et al. 1994). The periodate oxidation of adenovirus type 5 specifically targets the O\u2010glycosylated fibre, but virus is still able to attach and enter permissive cells. The mechanism behind the reduction in infectivity is suggested to be the action of produced formaldehyde resulting in cross\u2010links between the DNA and viral proteins (Ogier et al. 1994). Similarly, the murine cytomegalovirus is instantly inactivated by periodate, with a reduction in infectivity by 6 10log units. However, the virus remains immunogenic resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies in infected mice (Geoffroy, Moachon, Rodwell & Quash 1996). In our studies, we have introduced the amino acid glycine as a source of primary amino groups to possibly quench the action of exposed/released formaldehyde following the oxidative cleavage of carbohydrates. By this, we believe that the monitored effects of chemical oxidation should be a primary consequence of carbohydrate cleavage.",

Higher concentrations of periodate, between 10 and 50 mm, more drastically affected virion integrity as seen by disassembly and/or formation of aggregates.
