We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. This is an area which has been eclipsed by the current emphasis the huge number of trials evaluating new anti-viral drugs, repurposed drugs and combinations thereof. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of severe cases of MERS where mortality rates are upto 34% and MERS-CoV remains a WHO priority Blueprint pathogen. It's about time funding agencies now invest more into development MSCs per se and other host-directed therapies in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 and MERS death rates.",

SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells via the cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the target cell surface . ACE2 as a cardio-regulator, so there are numerous cells with ACE2 receptors in blood vessels, alveolar type II cells (AT2) in the lungs and several other organs, such as heart, kidneys. It appears that all three lethal zoonotic coronaviruses, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CV-2 seem to induce excessive and aberrant host immune responses which are associated with severe lung pathology leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Li G et al, 2020; Li G et al, 2020) . Characteristic findings on chest imaging in COVID 19 include bilateral ground glass and consolidative changes ). An associated cytokine storm may play a role in pathogenesis. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon gamma-induced protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory proteins 1-\u03b1 were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. (Huang C et al, 2020; Liu J et al, 2020) . Patients with evidence of hyperinflammation have an increased risk of mortality (Mehta et al, 2020; Ruan et al, 2020) . In those who survive intensive care, the long-term consequences of these aberrant and excessive immune responses may lead to long term pulmonary damage and fibrosis, with functional disability and reduction of quality of life. It is important that therapeutic interventions which can dampen the excess J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inflammation, thus preventing end organ damage and long-term functional disability in those who survive severe disease.",

Mesenchymal Stromal (Stem) Cells (MSCs) Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are being widely used in basic research and clinical application (Pittinger et al, 2019; Galipeau & Sensebe, 2018). MSCs are non haemopoetic cells which are derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, lung, umbilical cord tissue, dental pulp, and placenta. MSCs express certain markers such as CD73, CD90 and CD105 and test negative for CD14 (monocytes), CD19 (B-cells), CD34 (stem cells), CD11b (expressed on leukocytes including monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, granulocytes and macrophages).and CD45 expressed on all leucocytes (Ullah I et al, 2015; Dominic M et al, 2006; Hoogduijn M, 2005). They appear to exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs involve direct and indirect effects on the host immune cells (Le Blanc & Mougiakakos, 2012). The use of MSCs have been approved as Advanced Therapy Medical Products (ATMP) and the guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require MSCs to be produced under good manufacturing Practice (GMP) with quality control measures, reproducibility and (Torre et al, 2015; Codinach M et al, 2016).

MSCs also play a role in the control of tissue inflammation (Jiang et al, 2004). The therapeutic effects of MSCs have largely been attributed to their secretion of immunomodulatory and regenerative factors, and some of the effects may be mediated through host phagocytic cells which clear administered MSCs and in the process adapt an immunoregulatory and regeneration supporting function (Weiss & Dahike, 2019; Walter et al, 2004; Wang et al, 2018). In response to inflammatory factors such as Interferon (IFN\u03b3) and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF\u03b1) secreted by activated immune cells and tissue cells, MSCs can adopt an immunoregulatory phenotype (Ankrum et al 2014). They increase the expression of anti-inflammatory factors including programmed death ligand 1 and prostaglandin E2 and inhibit immune cell activity and proliferation through metabolic regulation, such as via indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase-dependent catabolism of tryptophan (Weiss & Dahike, 2019;).",

No adverse events or toxicity was observed at any of the doses tested. High-dose MSCs improved daily SOFA score compared to lower doses. The 'MUST-ARDS' clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02611609) tested safety of MultiStem (multi-potent adult progenitor cells, related to MSCs) cells in patients with ARDS. The results have been published in abstract form (Bellingham G et al, 2020) and results of 1 year followup are awaited. 30 patients with moderate to severe ARDS were recruited: 20 randomised to MultiStem cell therapy (at a dose of 900 million cells) and 10 to placebo. The therapy was well tolerated, and the authors reported trends to improvement in mortality in the MultiStem treated group, although the study was not powered for mortality. Additionally Phase 1 studies of MSCs in ARDS have been conducted by investigators in China and Taiwan.

A study published in Aging and Disease claimed the effectiveness of MSCs therapy was safe and attributed the recovery of all 7 patients who were administered MSCs (Ref see above comments).

The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity for a paradigm shift in focus from targeting the pathogen to the tackling host immune and inflammatory response which underlies the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The increased interest in therapeutic use of MSCs is a promising sign that COVID-19 pandemic and the year 2020 may be the dawn of the new therapeutic era of MSCs treatment for lethal infectious diseases. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of severe cases of MERS where mortality rates are upto 34% and MERS-CoV remains a WHO priority Blueprint pathogen (Memish et al, 2020). It's about time funding agencies now invest more into development MSCs per se and other host-directed therapies in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 and MERS death rates.
