Darwin's insights increasingly underpin our attempts to understand human diseases, and the hygiene hypothesis is becoming a major component of \u2018Darwinian medicine\u2019. This therefore is a good moment to wonder at an astonishing paradox: Google searches for \u2018Darwinian medicine\u2019 or \u2018evolutionary medicine\u2019 on 18 March 2009 revealed 22 200 and 32 100 hits, respectively. However, these terms did not exist in the MeSH database, so PUBMED searches yielded only a handful of papers. This might reflect a real failure of the medical establishment to value evolutionary medicine, and there is certainly a failure to recognize the \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 as one of its most obvious and important components.",

This term often refers to situations where an organism has become adapted to the presence of a partner through loss of genetic material, and can no longer function without that partner [1]. A classical example was seen in the laboratory environment when a strain of Amoeba discoides became infected with a bacterium [2]. Initially this infection compromised the growth of both species, so it was not a case of mutualism. However, after 5 years neither organism could survive without the other. This indicates genetic changes leading to dependence. For instance, an enzyme that is encoded in the genome of both species might be dropped from the genome of one of them. Access to that gene is now \u2018entrusted\u2019 to the other species. This idea is at first somewhat alien to immunologists, but is in fact rather commonplace. For instance, most mammals can synthesize vitamin C, but large primates and guinea pigs have lost the relevant pathways. Man and guinea pig are now in a state of evolved dependence on fruit and vegetables; we had the genes in the past, but we do not any more. Perhaps the best example of evolved dependence is the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial genome is closest to that of the Rickettsiae, but has lost much genetic material.",

However, the frequency of the genes leading to susceptibility to the infection will decrease rapidly.

Since the start of agriculture and pastoralism about 10 000 years ago, human adaptation to new environments has been cultural and technological rather than genetic. (Interestingly, human genetic diversity appears to be increasing more rapidly than ever before, but this is due to the population explosion rather than to adaptation to specific environments [4].) For example, we have not adapted genetically to living in cold places: we have learnt to make fur coats. Humans detect gene\u2013environment misfit easily within the physical environment and invent appropriate technological adaptations. However, the immune system does not provide us with conscious awareness that it is receiving inadequate microbial stimuli, so we have been unaware of the problem and we have not sought solutions. Only since the hygiene hypothesis appeared have we been wondering if the immune systems of people living in clean modern cities are receiving appropriate inputs.",

Elimination of most helminths, and of HAV, is well established [15]. A change in dose of microbial components can switch the lymphocyte types that are driven by their adjuvant effects. For instance, doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA or Chlamydia pneumoniae determine whether T helper type 2 (Th2) is increased or decreased [16]. Delayed infection can be crucial because it can occur after levels of antibody acquired from the mother have waned. For instance, HAV is harmless in small babies, but often fatal in the over-50s [10]. In the present context the important point is that the timing of virus infections is relevant to whether they enhance or inhibit type 1 diabetes [17,18]. Similarly, the epidemiology of the recent rapid increase in childhood acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL) is similar to that of type 1 diabetes and delayed infection with an unidentified organism is also a suggested mechanism in ALL [19].",

The orofaecally transmitted organisms, implicated in recent epidemiological studies of the hygiene hypothesis, are particularly illuminating [15,22\u201325]. The genetic diversity in H. pylori decreases with geographic distance from East Africa, where modern humans evolved, and like humans, H. pylori seems to have spread from East Africa around 58 000 years ago [26]. Similarly, Salmonella is an ancient organism (\u223c50 000 years), readily giving rise to carrier states [8,11]. Enteroviruses and HAV are picornaviruses that, like most of this group, probably co-speciated with Old World apes and humans [9]. HAV is stable and resistant to inactivation by environmental conditions [10], and its involvement in the hygiene hypothesis is explained in detail in this issue [15]. In developing countries the virus is ubiquitous, and babies are infected by the age of 3. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle involving sexual replication in members of the cat family (Felidae) and asexual propagation in nearly all orders of placental mammals (except baleen whales and insectivorous bats), as well as marsupials and birds. However, cysts can transmit the infection to carnivores, omnivores and scavengers, without any need for the sexual phase in the Felidae. Thus transmission to man is likely to have been extremely common long before the Neolithic, although perhaps increased after the start of husbandry and the domestication of the cat [27]. Other protozoa not yet considered in this context, to my knowledge, include the very ancient Entamoeba, Giardia and Trichomonas, all of which have lost their mitochondria and have a close association with humans.",

A recent study indicated that manipulations of the immune system sometimes operate indirectly via changes to the microbiota. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice develop spontaneous autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic \u03b2 cells. This did not occur in NOD mice, in which the gene-encoding myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) had been inactivated, suggesting a direct role for MyD88 in T cell-mediated responses to \u03b2 cells. However, this turned out to be an incorrect interpretation. Inactivation of MyD88 led to major changes in the gut microbiota, and this altered microbiota was responsible for the inhibition of the autoimmunity, which still occurred in MyD88\u2013/\u2013 germ-free NOD mice [29]. If this is correct, much conventional gene knock-out immunology might need to be re-interpreted. How many of the changed phenotypes seen have been secondary to changes in the microbiota? At the very least, this experiment emphasizes the very close relationship between the microbiota and the immune system, so gross changes caused by lifestyle, diet and antibiotics must be important. Some roles of the gut in immunoregulation are discussed elsewhere in this issue [30].",

Before the invention of modern soaps and detergents skin was probably colonized by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). These are ubiquitous in soil, but they are exquisitely sensitive to alkylbenzene sulphonate detergents [21]. AOB can convert the high concentrations of urea and ammonia found in human sweat into nitrite and nitric oxide (NO). These molecules are absorbed rapidly and efficiently via the skin, so this source of nitrite will have been biologically significant [21], and able to supplement the well-established blood\u2013saliva\u2013stomach\u2013blood cycle of nitrate/nitrite/NO. Feelisch believes that without AOB in the skin flora modern man is nitropenic ([21] and M. Feelisch, personal communication). Because NO is fundamental to immunoregulation, this might be another way in which modern hygiene is affecting our immune systems. It needs to be investigated.",

Administration of inflammatory cytokines for immunotherapy of cancer or hepatitis [IFN-\u03b1 or interleukin (IL)-2] causes depression, while anti-depressant drugs cause a relative increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines (reviewed and referenced in [38]).

Similarly, trials of a bacterial Treg-inducer are now planned for the type of depression that is accompanied by raised cytokine levels. Pritchard and colleagues in the United Kingdom have determined the maximum load of hookworm (Necator americanus) that can be tolerated without adverse effects [51]. A Phase 1 trial in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis has been completed [52], and further studies are in progress in allergies, multiple sclerosis and IBD. Similarly, Trichuris suis has been tested in inflammatory bowel disease [53], and is now entering trials in other disorders. Meanwhile, the exponents of probiotics are beginning to see that strains used for clinical trials in chronic inflammatory disorders need to be selected for their ability to induce immunoregulation. There is little point in trials of unsuitable strains imposed by companies that happen to hold intellectual property rights.",

I have tried to explore the underlying principles at the environmental and evolutionary level. The views expressed here help to explain the consistent failure of epidemiology that targets the identifiable, clinically apparent infections of childhood. Such studies fail to find any relevant associations with protection from allergic disorders [55]. The bias in these studies was dictated by hasty over-interpretation of the original findings of Strachan and colleagues [56] that had not undergone Darwinian scrutiny. Now we need to concentrate on organisms that have very long associations with the mammalian immune system, usually traceable back to the Paleolithic or earlier. Often these organisms will have been present as commensals, environmental \u2018pseudocommensals\u2019, subclinical infections or asymptomatic carrier states. This type of reasoning can potentially sharpen the focus of future epidemiology, simplify the quest for clinical solutions to the problem posed by the increasing incidence of inflammatory disorders, and broaden the range of microorganisms going into clinical trials.",

Epidemiological data, laboratory and animal models and preliminary clinical trials investigating the hygiene hypothesis implicate several of the organisms (top right of the figure, in bold type) that are thought to have accompanied mammalian and human evolution. This relationship was clearly long enough for the establishment of evolved dependence. Organisms that evolved during the Neolithic are less likely to be relevant in this context, and the first epidemiological transition did not reduce human contact with organisms associated with animals, faeces and mud that had been present during the Paleolithic. Conversely, the second epidemiological transition might have led to a gene\u2013environment misfit, as the \u2018old friends\u2019 from the Paleolithic were removed progressively from the modern environment.",

Obesity is associated with altered gut microbiota and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. Stress also alters gut microbiota and drives corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which increases permeability of the gut mucosa. Increased absorption of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other microbial components drives further release of proinflammatory cytokines. Lack of vitamin D exacerbates immunodysregulation, as does the triggering of T helper type 17 (Th17) cells by dioxins. Meanwhile, the changes in the gut are also likely to impact on Th17 development. Raised levels of proinflammatory cytokines trigger depression in some individuals, and this feeds back into the CRH/gut circuits.",
