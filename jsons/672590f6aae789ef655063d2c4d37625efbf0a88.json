Colleagues at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC) as well as the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) were contacted. The NML in Winnipeg, Canada's National Reference Laboratory which has a level 4 biosafety facility, had already received patient samples from Toronto and Vancouver and had succeeded in growing the virus in Vero6 cells. The NML purified the virus and were able to send to the GSC a sample of highly purified viral RNA (150 ng) which simplified considerably our ability to rapidly sequence the genome. This sample was obtained from the second victim of SARS in Toronto and was termed Tor2. As soon as the virus sample arrived at the BC CDC (approximately 5 PM on April 6) our rapid sequencing effort began.",

However, we repeated experiments to amplify a small region of the replicase gene using pancoronavirus primers, sequenced this fragment and confirmed that the sequence was related about 80 % at the protein level but only 50% at the nucleic acid level. This relatively low level of homology at the nucleic acid level caused us to shift our initial strategy to that of using combined oligo-dT and random primers to create a library of cDNA clones in two different vectors that could be submitted to our high-throughput sequencing pipeline.",

Purified viral RNA (55 ng) was used in an oligo-dT and random primers RT-PCR reaction using the SuperScript Choice System for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). At this stage, the samples were handled in a level 1 laboratory. EcoR I linkers were added to the DNA fragments and the products analyzed on an agarose gel. As expected, the products were barely visible and showed a range of sizes from ~400 bp-3000 bp. The fragments were resolved on a low melting point agarose gel and fragments of 1000-4000 bp were recovered. These frag-ments were amplified using the EcoR I linker as primers and ligated with the plasmid pCR4-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) at the EcoR I site or with pBR194 [5] using the Not I site. Each library was transformed into DH10B T1 cells (Invitrogen) and plated on 22 cm 2 agar plates and transformants obtained using ampicillin selection. After 16 hours, colonies were picked and grown in 2X YT and plasmid DNAs purified using our standard high-throughput alkaline lysis procedure.",

A library of fragments (~2,000 bp in length) was generated and arrayed into ten 384-well plates. The clones were sequenced from either end and the data assembled into the full length 29,751 nucleotide sequence [11] (see text for details). systems, Foster City, CA, USA). The fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on either an AB 3700 or AB 3730XL automated sequencing instrument and the data was collected automatically and transferred electronically to the Bioinformatics team for analysis. DNA sequence chromatograms were processed and trimmed for sequence quality using PHRED software [6] . Sequence reads were subsequently screened for nonviral contaminating sequences (almost exclusively plasmid vector sequences allowing us to infer that the virus RNA sample provided by the NML had been highly purified. The assembly of the sequence reads was carried out using the PHRAP sequence assembly software [7] . The sequences were also analyzed using BLAST [8] and FASTA [9] to search the viral and non-redundant protein datasets derived from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This revealed that the sequences were coronavirus related, but quite unlike any previously characterized coronavirus. Sequence data was accumulated until it was apparent that additional reads increased the depth of coverage but not the length of the sequence.

Annotation of the SARS virus sequence was carried out using the ACEDB genome database system [10] . Release 1 of the draft sequence was made public on the BCCA GSC website on April 12, 2003 in addition to being submitted to the NCBI Genbank sequence database. On April 14, the CDC (Atlanta) released their independently derived sequence for the Urbani strain of the SARS virus obtained using an RT-PCR method and direct sequencing of fragments. On comparison of these two sequences 12 nucleotides differed between the two strains. On further analysis four of these differences were resolved, leaving a total of only 8 differences between these strains [11] . Version 2 of our sequence was posted to our website on April 14, 2003 and this update was simultaneously submitted to the Genbank database. Release 2 of the genome sequence had an average PHRED consensus quality score of 89.96 with the lowest quality bases at the 5' and 3'ends of the viral genome. This average score corresponds to an expected error rate in sequence determination of 1 error in 10 8.96 base pairs. However, such an error rate corresponds only to the sequencing technology itself and does not account for other sources of potential error, e.g. reverse transcriptase errors during early phases of library construction. Each base in the sequence was determined on average 60 times (30 times in a forward direction and 30 times in a reverse direction). A subsequent release included the 5' most nucleotides which were determined by the RACE procedure using the RLM-RACE kit (Ambion Inc., Woodward, Austin, TX, USA). Release 3, the complete genome sequence, was deposited in Genbank (accession AY274119). We also immediately made available our clones via our website www.bcgsc.ca.",

This grouping of the viruses also agrees fairly well with the phylogenetic similarity of the viral genomes; however, some genomes have diverged sufficiently that the viruses are no longer antigenically cross-reactive. Phylogenetic analysis of four of the SARS ORFs (Rep, S, M, and N) by both the Vancouver and CDC Atlanta groups using unrooted analyses provided evidence (for all four comparisons) that the SARS virus represents a fourth group within the coronavirus family [11, 12] . Figures 3A and B illustrate the comparison for ORF 1a [11] and ORF1b [12] , respectively. However, others have now constructed a rooted phylogenetic tree, using the ORF1b gene of equine torovirus. This analysis suggests that the SARS-CoV is more related, albeit distantly, to group 2 coronaviruses than to any other group and shares a common ancestor early in coronavirus evolution ( Fig. 3C ) [16] .",

Yet another study by Stavrinides and Guttman suggests that the left portion of the SARS genome is derived from mammalian-like viruses while the right portion is derived from avian sources [18] .

However, the lack of evidence for a mammalian virus that is closely related to SARS to the left of the recombination point and an avian virus closely related to sequences to the right, leaves room for an alternative interpretation. The SARS-CoV may have arisen by an ancient recombination occurring a long time ago in the natural history of the SARS coronavirus and that subsequently this recombinant virus has been evolving over a long time period would seem like a more rational interpretation of these data. There are currently over 100 SARS-CoV complete or partial sequences in GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/query.fcgi?db= nucleotide&cmd=search&term=%22SARS+coronavirus%22, including several isolates from civet cats, one of several possible animal hosts responsible for transmitting the virus to humans [19] . While it is unclear if civet cats are the natural reservoir for this novel coronavirus, there does appear to have been another transfer event (maybe from civet cats or rats) in Guangdong, reported in December 2003. Analysis of this sequence will hopefully shed more light on the origin of the human SARS virus, however at this point, most hypotheses are based on a very limited amount of data. Future characterization of many additional animal SARS virus isolates will help to elucidate the true origin of the human SARS-CoV.",

Sequences referred to as TRS (transcription regulatory sequences) occur within the genomic RNA upstream of the major ORFs. These TRS sequences which have a common core sequence (5'-UAAACGAAC-3') are believed to facilitate the dissociation of the replicase complex from the genomic RNA and reassociation with similar sequences within the template RNA near the 5' end of the genome referred to as the leader sequence, generating a nested set of minus strand subgenomics RNAs. The mRNAs are then transcribed in a continuous fashion from these subgenomics negative strands, generating a nested set of mRNAs. Hence each of the mRNAs contains a leader sequence of ~72 nt (corresponding with the 5' end of the viral genome) attached to one of the downstream viral ORFs and all sequence 3' to that region.",

Those lacking obvious TRS core sequences include ORFs 4, 13 and 14.

The mechanism illustrated is believed to be responsible for generating the nested set of mRNAs used to express coronavirus proteins. The coronavirus plus strand genome is transcribed into subgenomic minus strand RNAs. During the transcription process the RdRp encounters one of several TRS (transcription regulatory sequences) located upstream of the viral ORFs. The RdRp then jumps to the 5' leader sequence and finishes synthesis of the transcripts. The family of subgenomics minus strands are then copied into a family of subgenomic plus strands, the mRNAs used for translation of the viral proteins. The mRNA for ORF1a and ORF1b is synthesized from a full length minus strand transcript [22, 23] and during translation can undergo a -1 ribosomal frameshift (see text and Fig. 7 below) .",

The molar ratio of the fragments indicates that some transcripts are clearly more abundant than others, with the most abundant transcripts the ones that likely are translated into the E and M proteins. If the inability to detect additional subgenomic transcripts is not simply due to their low level of expression, it would appear that the use of bicistronic mRNA is likely the method used to express at least half of the putative proteins encoded by the ORFs in the right one third of the SARS genome. Thiel et al. [15] have also confirmed the leader to body fusion sites on the subgenomic mRNAs using RT-PCR to transcribe the mRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero6 cells. Subsequent PCR amplification using a second \"body\" primer plus a primer specific for the leader sequence generated fragments that were sequenced to determine the junction of the leader to the body of the mRNA.

Astell et al. 3' end of ORF 1b, the second half of the large ORF encoding the replicase gene. This sequence is capable of driving the packaging of foreign RNA into MHV particles [25] . Qin et al.

The structural motif for the packaging signals of several coronaviruses appears to be a long stem-loop structure of which the top of loops are similar. Analysis of the SARS genome showed that a similar structure (Fig. 6B) is found in a hypervariable region of ORF1b displaced slightly upstream relative to the packaging signals for MHV and BCoV. This packaging signal needs to be tested experimentally and may prove to be a useful target for development of an antiviral agent.",

ORF 1a is translated into a large polypeptide of ~4,000 aa while a fused ORF1ab can be translated into a polyprotein of ~7,000 aa. As is the case with other coronaviruses, ORFs 1a and 1b can be fused together into one large ORF by a -1 frameshift event which is believed to occur by a process of slippage on the ribosome [28] . In the case of the SARS virus the C-terminal end of the ORF 1a polypeptide is \u2026. L-N-G-F-A-V-STOP (Fig. 7) . At least part of the time a -1 frameshift occurs, yielding a read-through polypeptide with the sequence \u2026.L-N-R-V-C-G-V -etc. A pseudoknot, a specialized region of secondary structure within the mRNA, immediately downstream from the position of the frameshift, is believed to cause the ribosome to pause during translation. Upstream of the pseudoknot is a consensus \"slippery sequence\" NNNAAAN.. or ..NNNTTTN.. where the first three Ns can be any nucleotide but they must be the same nucleotide [29] . In the case of the SARS genome the sequence is \u2026TTTAAACGGG\u2026. When the ribosome encounters the pseudoknot, there is a pause in reading of the mRNA and the mRNA is shifted back one nucleotide, allowing only partial yet stable interactions with the peptidyl-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA on the ribosome. Figure 7A illustrates the SARS virus mRNA sequence with the codons lined up opposite the anticodons for leucine (L) and asparagine (N) when the normal reading frame is used, while Figure 7B illustrates the position when a -1 frameshift occurs. In Figure 7C the ribosome continues translation in the -1 reading frame, generating a polypeptide ~7,000 nt in length. Initial annotation of this large ORF identified the RdRp (POL) gene, a putative RNA helicase and two proteases, a chymotrypsin-like protease 3CL pro and a papain-like protease PL pro [11, 12] . Gorbalenya and coworkers have been studying the coronavirus replicase ORFs for several years [30] [31] [32] and have recently provided an extensive analysis of the SARS-CoV 1a and 1b ORFs [16] (Tab. 2).",

In all other coronaviruses three proteinases, a 3CL pro , PL1 pro and PL2 pro function in cleaving these polyproteins [34, 35] . However, Rota et al. [12] and more recently Snijder et al. [16] proposed that the PL1 pro has been lost during evolution such that only the 3CL pro and PL2 pro virally encoded proteinases function in processing of the SARS-CoV replicase polyprotein. The putative recognition sites within the 1a and 1b regions are summarized in Table 2 . The PL2 pro is predicted to autocatalytically cut at the first three arrowheads near the N-terminal end of the polyprotein, while the 3CL pro is predicted to cut at all other sites. If all consensus sites are recognized by these enzymes then the 1a and 1ab polyproteins will generate 16 proteins ranging in size from 18 amino acids up to 1922 amino acids. The sizes and putative function of these proteins is summarized in Table 2 (modified from Snijder et al. [16] ). Also, each of these proteins is assigned a number, in order, designated as nsp (nonstructural protein) 1 to 16. Some of these proteins would be translated from both the 1a and the 1ab polypeptides, while others would be translated exclusively from the 1b region on the full-length frame-shifted transcript. The replicase subunits are thought to exist as a large membrane-associated complex including at least the RdRp, RNA helicase, and several putative RNA processing enzymes such as Poly(U) specific endoribonuclease (XendoU,nsp 15), a 3' to 5' exonuclease (ExoN,nsp 14) , S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2'O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MT,nsp 16,), adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1''-phosphatase (ADRP, nsp3) (Tab. 2). Several other proteins are predicted to be membrane associated and may facilitate formation of the membrane-associate replicase complex. One can imagine a large complex that synthesizes discontinuously the subgenomic minus strands and then transcribes these into the functional mRNAs.",

It is probable that the genomic plus strands that have a polyA tail are transcribed into subgenomic minus strands and when these are converted to mRNAs, the polyA tail is added by copying the template strand. Presumably loss of the polyA tract would destine that genome to be lost from the gene pool. How the 5' cap structure is formed is unclear. There is a consensus sequence for a mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase [36] and a 2'-O-MT [16] which may play some role in 5' cap formation but so far a nucleotidyl transferase activity has not been identified in the viral genome.",

The S protein is predicted to be 1255 amino acids in length and like other coronavirus S proteins it is likely heavily glycosylated. Mutations in this gene have previously correlated with altered pathogenesis and virulence in other coronaviruses [14] . Bioinformatic analysis of the SARS S protein using SignalP [41] showed a likely signal peptide at the N terminus (13-14 amino acids) and TMHMM [42] identified a strong transmembrane domain near the Cterminus, consistent with this protein being a type I membrane protein embedded in the viral envelope with most of the protein exposed on the surface. Proteomic analysis by Krokhin et al. [43] has also confirmed twelve glycosylation sites on this protein and the attached sugars for 4 of these sites have already been identified. Many of the SARS structural proteins appear to be membrane-associated proteins. A model of the predicted membrane-associated nature and orientation of these proteins is shown in Figure 8 (modified from http://athena.bioc.uvic.ca/sars/map/diagram-main. html/). It is believed that three molecules of the coronavirus S proteins form the characteristic peplomers or corona-like structure of this viral family. For some coronaviruses, specific regions of the S protein that bind to cellular receptors have been identified. Also it is known that various coronaviruses use different cellular receptors to mediate entry of the virus into host cells, hence it will be important to establish both the cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV and the viral attachment site on the S protein as possible antiviral targets for this new pathogen.",

The S glycoprotein for the Sars-CoV shows a remarkably low sequence homology with other coronavirus S proteins. This low homology is especially notable in the N-terminal 700 amino acids of the protein. Spiga et al. [44] have presented a molecular modeling analysis of the S1 and S2 regions of the SARS-CoV S protein using the crystal structure of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin B protein. These molecular models predict the overall shape and surface hydrophobicity of the S1 and S2 subunits and until a crystal structure is available, these will be a good starting point for design of antiviral drugs.",

In comparison, it took several years before the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was identified in 1983-4 as the agent responsible for a newly described immunodeficiency disease, AIDS [14] . Characterization of HIV has led to the development of a number of drugs that slow the progression of AIDS and multi-drug therapies (\"highly active antiretroviral therapy\" or HAART) have changed HIV infection from a terminal disease to a chronic one.

The success of vaccines for avian, bovine, feline, and porcine coronaviruses bodes well for the development of a vaccine against the SARS-CoV [51] and a report of a recent conference in Switzerland indicates preliminary progress from a number of laboratories towards developing a vaccine directed against the S, E and N proteins using a variety of inactivated virus, recombinant vectors, recombinant antigens, as well as DNA-based vaccines (http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/sars/events/2003/11/en/). Yet further reason for optimism is the very recent discovery by Li et al. [52] that unlike other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV uses a receptor on cells -the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 -and drugs that block this receptor already have been developed for other conditions. The ACE2 inhibitors have been tested in humans, and some appear to be safe, but they have not yet been commercialized [52, 53] . In addition, the other half of the interaction, the receptor binding domain on the S protein, has been localized to residues 303 to 537 of the S protein [53] . Also learning from the experience with HIV virus in which soluble receptor protein (sCD4) proved ineffective in blocking HIV infection while a multivalent CD4-IgG fusion protein does seem to be effective, it has been speculated that soluble ACE2-IgG fusions may prove useful in treating SARS infections [53] .",

While the natural host has not been identified, if appears that the virus spread from civet cats into humans. Since the civet cat virus and only one human isolate of the SARS-CoV contains the additional 29 nt in the ORF 10/11 region, it is tempting to speculate that transfer of the virus to humans was accompanied by a deletion of 29 nt. If this is the case, the characterization and function of ORF 10, ORF11 and ORF 10' may provide considerable insight into why the SARS-CoV is so pathogenic in humans.",
