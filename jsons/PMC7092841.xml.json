Results indicated that BS/U6/gfp had no effect on SPAG9 expression (Fig. 3\nC), whereas a reduced expression was observed in GFP expressing cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, a reduction in SPAG9 (Fig. 3E), but not in GFP (Fig. 3F), expression by employing BS/U6/spag9 revealed the specific gene silencing of SPAG9 by BS/U6/spag9 and not by BS/U6/gfp. Yet another evidence for specific inhibition of target gene by BS/U6/spag9 was carried out using mammalian JNK-3 (c-Jun NH2-terminal Kinase-3) gene from MAPK signal transduction pathway. The cotransfection experiment using pcDNA-SPAG9 and pFLAG-CMV2-JNK3 with empty vector BS/U6 or BS/U6/spag9 or BS/U6/gfp revealed that BS/U6 or BS/U6/gfp did not inhibit the expression of either SPAG9 (Figs. 4\nA and C) or JNK-3 protein (Figs. 4B and D). However, BS/U6/spag9 resulted in remarkable reduction in the expression of SPAG9 (Fig. 4E) without affecting JNK-3 expression (Fig. 4F). The results thereby demonstrate that the BS/U6/spag9-mediated specific gene silencing of SPAG9 without any effect on the expression of unrelated genes.

Further, BS/U6/spag9 was examined for non-specific gene silencing using unrelated genes expressing GFP and JNK-3. The expression of GFP and JNK-3 was analyzed after transfecting COS-1 cells with pEGFPN2 and pFLAG-CMV2-JNK-3 plasmids with BS/U6/spag9 (6 \u03bcg) or BS/U6/gfp (10 \u03bcg) or empty vector BS/U6 (10 \u03bcg).

            "text": "The present investigation reports for the first time gene silencing of a sperm-specific protein using siRNA approach. SPAG9, a new member of JNK-interacting protein family, is a novel testis-specific protein exclusively expressed in testis [1], [19]. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed conservation of SPAG9 in human and non-human primates predicting functional interactions of proteins, as well as the evolutionary relationships between genomes [2], [4], [5], [6], [20]. MAPK interaction studies demonstrated that SPAG9 functions as a scaffolding protein exhibiting higher binding affinity to JNK3 and JNK2 compared to JNK1 [1], [2]. The interaction is important in view of the pleiotropic endpoints of JNK signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immune cell function, and embryonic morphogenesis [21]. In most cases, the functional consequences of interaction between JNKs and scaffolding proteins are not yet fully understood; however, they are likely to play an important role in regulating JNK signaling pathways towards a particular physiological event. A recent study demonstrated that IB1/JIP1 facilitates the signal transduction in pancreatic \u03b2-cell lines mediated by the interacting proteins. IB1/JIP-1 interacts with JNK through the JNK binding domain (JBD), a domain able to prevent apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2-cell lines induced by IL-1\u03b2 and thus act as a crucial regulator of survival in insulin-secreting cells [22]. Similarly, SPAG9 interacts with JNKs through its JBD, which exhibits a significant sequence identity to JBD of JIP1, JIP2, and JIP3. The earlier study involving SPAG9 mutant lacking JBD (SPAG9\u0394LZ\u0394T) failed to show any interaction with JNK pathway, suggesting that JNK binding domain of SPAG9 is involved in JNK interaction [1]. Moreover, the expression of SPAG9 in various cancers such as esophageal adenocarcinoma [8] and Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) [9] thereby suggests the possible involvement of SPAG9 interactions with JNKs in signal transduction pathways leading to cellular proliferation and tumor growth. Recently, sperm protein 17 (Sp17) [10] and sperm c lysozyme-like protein 1 (SLLP1) expression [11] was also reported in various cancer tissues. Though at present the exact nature of involvement of SPAG9 in tumorigenesis is not known, further investigations are warranted. The present study provides more evidence for the existence of RNAi induced gene silencing in mammalian cells and also suggests possibilities for using RNAi as an effective tool to determine the functional genomics of SPAG9 in tumor and reproductive biology.",

            "text": "One more important aspect of siRNA studies is to explore the extent of siRNA specificity towards the gene of interest. siRNA-mediated gene silencing is generally believed to be highly sequence-specific. Tuschl and co-workers [18] demonstrated that even a single base mismatch between siRNA and its mRNA target abolished gene silencing. The caveats in specificity of gene silencing by RNAi mean there is an absolute requirement to test the selectivity of a siRNA before embarking on phenotype analysis. However, since RNAi, in contrast to the traditional knockout approach, does not completely eliminate the protein of interest, it was critical to evaluate the efficiency of siRNAs at the protein level. Therefore, we compared the silencing effect of two independent SPAG9 siRNAs (BS/U6/spag9 and BS/U6/spag9-I) on SPAG9 protein expression. The immunofluorescence and Western blotting results revealed that BS/U6/spag9 was fully competent to knockdown the SPAG9 expression. In contrast, SPAG9 expression was resistant to siRNA induced ablation using BS/U6/spag9-I. In addition, we evaluated the effect of BS/U6/spag9 on unrelated GFP and JNK3 proteins using SPAG9 as a positive control for determining the specificity of BS/U6/spag9. The expression of JNK-3 and GFP remained unaffected by BS/U6/spag9, suggesting that BS/U6/spag9 functions specifically to inhibit target gene and has no RNAi effect on unrelated gene expression.",

We hereby provide strong evidence that a DNA vector-based RNAi approach functions effectively in silencing SPAG9 gene expression in mammalian cells. The present study is beneficial in terms of providing proof of concept for further employment of a lentiviral vector-based siRNA approach in generating transgenic mice to study the functional genomics of SPAG9. Thus, the ease and convenience of deleting gene function combined with the ability to make transgenic animals using lentiviral vector-based RNAi would give a useful insight into exploring the biological function of SPAG9 in reproductive biology. Moreover, exploiting siRNA against SPAG9, which exhibits aberrant expression in various cancerous tissues, may give useful insight into the role of SPAG9 in cellular proliferation and programmed cell death and therefore warrants further investigations.",
