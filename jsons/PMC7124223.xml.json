            "text": "Expansion of technological capabilities over the past two decades has increased our understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for voice and laryngeal-related disorders. Consequently, increased interest in a variety of neoplastic, functional, neurological, and age-related laryngeal disorders has contributed to the development of laryngology as an established subspecialty. Extramural funding support may play a critical role in facilitating scholarship within the field. Prior analyses in multiple specialties have noted an association between greater scholarly impact and receiving funding awards from several organizations, most importantly the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Awards from the NIH are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d in biomedical research, as this organization is the largest supporter of scientific inquiry in the world [11], [12], [13]. Nonetheless, funding opportunities have declined in recent years [14], increasing the competition for these grants. In many cases, ability to procure external funding is necessary for the viability of a primary investigator (PI), as many institutions may be unable to provide significant funding via internal mechanisms.",

Speech pathologists, PhD researchers, engineers, and of course otolaryngologists all contribute to this broad and ever-changing area of study. This can be partly attributed to new clinical practice guidelines, where clinicians are recommended to refer to voice therapy rather than prescribing antibiotics for treating routine voice disorders such as hoarseness [18]. Because of this interdisciplinary approach a healthy portion of the current research on voice disorders is being completed by speech pathologists, only occasionally in conjunction with otolaryngology departments. While PhD researchers and otolaryngologists comprise over 70% of NIH funded research on the topic, speech pathology research makes up over 13% of the total (Fig. 1B). An increasingly collaborative approach between otolaryngologists and speech pathologists could lead further research opportunities, particularly in light of the current increasingly competitive funding atmosphere.",

To quantitatively measure this, the authors used the h-index of each principal investigator. Upon comparison of speech pathologists to otolaryngologists that received NIH funding for their research, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the h-indices of the two groups, with otolaryngologists having a significantly higher h-index than speech pathologists. While statistically significant, the practical significance of this result is questionable. Although this measure has utility as an objective indicator of the frequency at which an individual is having an impact upon scholarly discourse within his or her field, prior analyses have noted that scholarly impact values vary widely by factors such as size of one\u2019s field, as this may have a substantial impact on the size of audiences for a field\u2019s journals, ultimately affecting objective bibliometrics such as the h-index\n[10].",

A recent survey of otolaryngology residents revealed that less than half (41%) of respondents felt they had adequate operative laryngology instruction during their residency training, with approximately the same number reporting that they were comfortable providing laryngology care [20]. In light of these findings, only 6 of 42 (14.3%) projects with otolaryngologist PIs involved a fellowship-trained laryngologist (Table 1). This suggests that there may be room for structured research opportunities in laryngology fellowships that encourage incorporation of basic and clinical research in subsequent careers.",

Over half of all NIH funded projects in voice disorders (58%) were granted to PhDs (Fig. 1). By having PhD researchers in otolaryngology departments, residency trainees interested in voice disorders and laryngology fellows may have additional opportunities to produce meaningful and impactful research. Fundamentally, this can be achieved by receiving significant support from external funding organizations, most notably the NIH. Furthermore, this may also encourage the advancement of clinical research in the field of voice disorders due to the enhanced scholarly atmosphere. Our analysis notes a minority (6.6%) of funded projects in otolaryngology departments are headed by fellowship-trained laryngologists (Table 1). It is only logical that if residency trainees are exposed to voice disorder research early in their training, there will be more interest and academic scholarship in the field later in their careers.",

The data were collected from the NIH RePORTER database system; funding totals in the database are only available for projects that occurred in 2000 or later. This comprised approximately 28% of the total, and included some projects that went on for many years that could potentially have been issued large NIH grants. In retrospect there may have been some limitations in our search criteria, and we could have possibly included such search broad terms as \u201cvoice treatment\u201d or \u201clarynx\u201d to encompass the large amount of research being done under the topic of normal voice function. We did, however, want to stay true to our initial topic of focusing solely on voice disorders. Also, due to the large number of projects in our data analysis, it was difficult at times to group the projects into their proper specialties or categories. Many of the PIs were grouped into the \u201cunknown\u201d category by the NIH RePORTER database, and the authors used Internet searches to discover the specialties of these individuals. Certain principal investigators could not be properly categorized by Internet searches and were thus unfortunately placed into this \u201cunknown\u201d grouping, possibly clouding the true nature of categorical differences between specialties in funding. There was also the issue of not categorizing each grant into specific types, such as certain training grants given out by the NIH. This could be a direction for future research, looking into the need for laryngology fellowship programs to obtain these NIH training grants to further promote scholarship in the field of voice disorders.",

Working side-by-side with SLPs will help secure vital NIH funding and place otolaryngologists at the forefront of research that could be most beneficial to patients. The growing field of laryngology as a subspecialty could also stand to benefit from the increase hiring of PhDs in academic positions in departments.
