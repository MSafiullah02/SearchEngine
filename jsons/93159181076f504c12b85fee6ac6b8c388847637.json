This is a process by which two distinct subtypes of influenza simultaneously infect a single cell, creating progeny virions with segmented genomes derived from random combinations of the original two viruses. 4 Influenza A has a broader host range, including birds, humans, and other mammals, and as a result has a greater potential for reassortment events between unrelated subtypes. 3 Such events can lead to the creation of strains with greatly increased pathogenicity and the potential for pandemic spread. In spring of 2009, a new strain of influenza, pH1N1, emerged from a recombination event in swine. This strain spread rapidly, eventually leading to a worldwide pandemic. This subtype continues to persist among the circulating subtypes of seasonal influenza. 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] Other virulent subtypes of influenza persist at low levels with the potential to be a threat to public health globally; for example, avian-derived H5N1 has caused several outbreaks with high rates of mortality, 3,4,10-12 and H7N9, first reported in 2013, has also been responsible for several outbreaks with high mortality. 13, 14 Diagnostic Utility Patients with influenza often experience some degree of respiratory symptoms such as cough, rhinorrhea, or sore throat. Respiratory symptoms are often accompanied by more generalized systemic symptoms including fever, malaise, weakness and fatigue. 5 Diagnosis can be difficult since many of these symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with those caused by other common respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus, and thus a specific clinical diagnosis can be challenging. However, identification of influenza specifically as the etiologic agent of disease can be important for several reasons, including initiation of antiviral therapy and appropriate infection control measures. 15 The antiviral therapy available for the treatment of influenza includes neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, and M2 ion channel inhibitors, such as amantadine. Influenza B is inherently resistant to amantadine, and oseltamivir resistance has been associated with some strains of influenza A.

Significant disadvantages of these methods include the requirement for a fluorescent microscope, technologists skilled in interpretation and suboptimal sensitivity. Viral culture has historically been used as a sensitive method of detection and still remains the gold standard for influenza diagnosis. 3, 4 Viral culture typically involves the inoculation of the patient specimen into a cell culture monolayer (such as rhesus monkey kidney, human fibroblasts, and A549 human lung carcinoma cells). Some culture systems combine multiple cell lines into a single monolayer (ie, R-Mix Freshcells, Athens, OH), allowing for increased sensitivity and breadth of respiratory virus detection. Following inoculation, cultures are typically incubated at 37 C and examined microscopically for evidence of viral cytopathic effect and/or stained with fluorescent antibodies to detect viral particles in the cells. 7 Since viral culture requires extensive technical expertise, can have a prolonged turnaround time (up to a week) and is a potential biosafety concern as a result of viral propagation, many laboratories have abandoned it in favor of performing antigen testing and/or molecular methods directly on patient samples.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 262, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 263, "end": 265, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 384, "end": 386, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 880, "end": 882, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 883, "end": 884, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1481, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fluorescent Antibody Analysis and Viral Culture"}, {"text": "The initial introduction of antigen testing was an important breakthrough in the management of influenza, allowing physicians to obtain results in a time frame relevant to patient care. Early antigen detection assays were enzyme immunoassay-based utilizing membrane-bound capture antibodies and several incubation/washing steps. 3, 7 Compared to viral culture, early studies suggested sensitivities of the antigenbased methods of between 64% and 78%. 20 Today, antigenbased testing has evolved into rapid, low-complexity, selfcontained devices utilizing predominantly immunochromatographic methodologies. Advantages of these rapid influenza detection tests (RIDTs) include quick turnaround time (often less than 30 minutes) and ease of use. These features allow many of these assays to be offered as point of care testing devices. At the time of preparation of this manuscript, more than 15 RIDTs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 21 Although these assays are convenient, a significant drawback of RIDTs is a lack of sensitivity. Various studies have demonstrated that the sensitivity of rapid antigen detection assays ranges from 50% to 80%. 3 There are several reasons for this suboptimal analytical performance characteristic. One factor is that the sensitivity of rapid antigen detection is inherently dependent on the amount of viral antigen present in clinical samples, often requiring 10 4 to 10 6 infectious particles. 22 Adults shed less virus compared to infected children, and thus it is not surprising that the sensitivity of rapidantigen detection tests for respiratory viruses in general are greatly reduced in adults compared to children. 23 Another factor contributing to the variable analytical performance characteristics of rapid antigen tests is the variation in the influenza strains themselves, which was best illustrated with the 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus. A Centers of Disease Control study evaluating three different antigen assays demonstrated a 40% to 69% sensitivity for the 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus compared to sensitivities ranging from 60% to 83% for strains circulating previously. 24 These findings were supported by other studies, including a New York study citing an astonishing sensitivity of only 9.6% for the detection of 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus by a commonly used rapid antigen detection test. 25 While a lack of sensitivity can lead to difficulty in interpreting negative results, problems with specificity make positive results equally challenging to interpret. A small 2010 study of 45 specimens positive by RIDT demonstrated that 17 (37.8%) were actually false positives. 26 A second study during the same year compared 336 RIDT results to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results obtained from specimens tested at several different facilities. This study demonstrated an alarming RIDT specificity of 48.1% when compared to PCR. 27 Despite these limitations, the appeal of a rapid, pointof-care diagnostic leads to the continued use of these assays in many settings. Following the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic, a survey of hospital laboratories revealed that 84% continued to use RIDTs. 28 Novel RIDTs are continuously in development, and efforts have been made to address concerns regarding sensitivity. One such recently developed assay, the BD Veritor System Flu A \u00fe B (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD), is a digital immunoassay that is purported to have improved sensitivity compared to other RIDTs. Comparative studies have demonstrated superior performance of this assay compared to other commonly used RIDTs using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as a gold standard.

As a result, the FDA cleared 16 tests for 2009 pH1N1 under emergency use authorization, four of which would ultimately gain FDA clearance for influenza testing. 34 Multiplexed assays for respiratory pathogens, including influenza, can allow for the detection of multiple pathogens from a single specimen, and while this can be advantageous, at times the results of this testing can be challenging to interpret. The detection of more than one pathogen within a single specimen has been reported in 10% to 30% of patients tested with multiplexed NAATs. The association of these mixed infections and disease is uncertain, with many studies showing conflicting results. 52 Additionally, it is not fully understood what the detection of a viral pathogen means in an asymptomatic individual. Rhinovirus/enterovirus has been detected in healthy adults and children, in addition to immunocompromised individuals. Other respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses and human metapneumoviruses are less commonly detected in asymptomatic individuals, and influenza and RSV are rarely detected. Coinfections and viral detection in asymptomatic individuals leads to questions and concerns regarding the management and treatment of these patients. 53 Finally, an important consideration in the widespread adoption of NAATs for influenza is cost. Many of the assay platforms require significant capital investment, and each assay may have a high cost. However, reduced hands-on time in the laboratory, as well as expedited and accurate diagnosis may achieve overall cost-effectiveness at the institutional level. To date, only a few articles have attempted to examine the cost-effectiveness of multiplex syndromic panels as compared to other testing methods. [54] [55] [56] [57] Many of these studies are focused on specific tests and/or specific patient populations. Additional, larger studies comparing different panels and clinical outcomes are needed to fully understand the true cost-effectiveness of these syndromic panels. Also, awareness of future changes in reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could greatly have an impact on the cost-effectiveness of this testing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1121, "end": 1123, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1628, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2233, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2741, "end": 2745, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2746, "end": 2750, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2755, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2760, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Molecular Diagnostic Testing for Influenza-Challenges and Limitations"}, {"text": "In light of the detection of influenza A in our patient, and a corresponding chest X-ray that was not suggestive of pneumonia, a five-day course of oseltamivir was prescribed, and ciprofloxacin was discontinued.

Previous laboratory methods were complex, and typically required a high level of training and the laborious maintenance of cell lines. Unfortunately, RIDTs have decreased sensitivity, and due to this inadequate sensitivity, the FDA has reclassified these tests and set specific criteria for both sensitivity and specificity that must be recalculated each year based on the currently circulating subtypes. In the future, this should have a great impact on the performance of these diagnostic tests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary/Conclusion"}, {"text": "Many clinical laboratories have chosen to replace influenza antigen detection assays with molecular diagnostics.

This is used to provide subtype information for influenza A and is also used in the design of \"syndromic\" PCR panels, which can test for over a dozen different respiratory pathogens in one assay.
