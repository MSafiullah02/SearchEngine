Much of human intelligence involves pattern recognition, a process that matches a visual or other type of stimuli, to similar information stored in our brains. Although endowed with abstract thinking and capable of sublime leaps in imagination, humans have a limited capacity for memory. It is estimated that the brain cannot store more than four \u201cchunks\u201d of short-term memory at any one time [3]. Moreover, humans find it difficult to think in terms of n-dimensional spaces or visualize patterns embedded into large quantities of data. Conversely, computers have vast memory storage, excel at handling multidimensional problems and can discern even small or \u201cfuzzy\u201d associations within massive data collections.",

The next step is to determine the size of the feature matrix and the classification vector (Fig. 5). Whereas humans develop generalized concepts on the basis of just a few examples, training a machine learning algorithm requires large quantities of data. The creation of a large feature matrix with its classification vector is accomplished by gathering as many instances as possible. Once satisfied that we have collected an adequate number of examples to be presented to the computer, we split the feature matrix into a \u201ctraining\u201d dataset, for model development, and a \u201ctest\u201d dataset. The data are split by a random process that assigns instances from the original data to each dataset. A common practice is to use 70% or 80% of the data for training and the remainder for testing.\n",

A Swedish system using artificial neural networks applied to >200,000 first-time ICU admissions also showed superior performance in predicting the risk of dying when compared to SAPS-3 [24]. Machine learning models have also been proposed to predict mortality in trauma [25] and pediatric ICU patients [26].",

Machine learning methods of detecting patient-ventilator asynchrony have been based on morphological changes of the pressure and flow signals. Chen et al. [37] developed an algorithm to identify ineffective efforts from the maximum deflection of the expiratory portion of airway pressure and flow. Ineffective effort was present in 58% of the 24 patients enrolled in their study. Analysis of 5899 breaths yielded sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ineffective efforts >90%. An algorithm developed by Blanch at al [38]. compared a theoretical exponential expiratory flow curve to actual flow tracings. A deviation exceeding 42% was considered indicative of ineffective effort. They compared the predictions of the algorithm in a random selection of 1024 breaths obtained from 16 patients, to those made by five experts and reported 91.5% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity with 80.3% predictive value. As proof-of-concept, this group also reported monitoring airway signals in 51 mechanically ventilated patients and were able to predict the probability of an asynchrony occurring from one breath period to the next using a hidden Markov model [39]. The system used in these trials has been commercialized as Better Care\u00ae, and it is capable of acquiring, synchronizing, recording, and analyzing digital signals from bedside monitors and mechanical ventilators [38].",

Therefore, the greatest challenge when creating a clinical machine learning model lies in identifying the gold standard to be used in the classification. A great deal of what we see and do in medicine is highly subjective, and unanimity of opinion is seldom found among intensivists. For example, a study [46] on interobserver reliability of clinicians in diagnosing ARDS according to the Berlin definition found only a moderate degree of reliability (kappa = 0.50). The main driver of the variability was the interpretation of chest radiographs. Similar findings were noted in clinicians evaluating optic disk photographs for glaucoma (kappa 0.40\u20130.52) [47].

            "text": "The full potential of AI will be realized once it becomes a trustworthy clinical adjunct to intensivists. By helping us cope with information overload, AI endowed machines may allow our faculties of reflection, imagination, and compassion to come to the fore when caring for fellow humans in distress. The future of AI in the ICU is indeed bright. As with all new technologies, there will be zealots and pharisees, ups and downs, elations and disappointments, as well as thorny ethical quandaries. I have no doubt, however, that AI is here to stay, and it behooves us to become familiar with this technology for the betterment of our patients.",
