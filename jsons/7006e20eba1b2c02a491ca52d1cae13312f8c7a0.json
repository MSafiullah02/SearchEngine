Confusion over when trans people are allowed to access essential services further exposes them to violence through policing carried out by law enforcement and civil society more broadly. While surveillance of this law is based on physical appearance, citizens are required to show their national identity document if stopped by the police. Physical expressions of gender identity vary and access to gender affirming procedures and resources are deeply impacted by cost. Further, in the absence of a gender identity law, gender congruent identity documents require many arduous and expensive processes. Gender congruent IDs, thus, are inaccessible for the majority of Peruvian transgender women.",

Within the first two days following the implementation of gender restrictions, the Observatory of LGBTQ Human Rights at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia documented eleven cases of violence and related suffering experienced by gender non-binary people directly related to this law. Ultimately, the enactment of this policy intervention has reified ID documents as both a structural determinant of health for transgender people and a fundamental human right.",
