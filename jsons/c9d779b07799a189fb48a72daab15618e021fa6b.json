This facility was populated with caesarian derived, colostrum deprived (CDCD) piglets, from sows of conventionalspecific (or specified) pathogen-free (SPF) health status in six cohorts over a 10-month period. In all cases, CDCD piglets fulfilled DPF status including negativity for porcine circovirus (PCV), a particularly environmentally robust and difficult to inactivate virus which at the time of SAF population was epidemic in the US commercial swine production industry. Two outbreaks of PCV infection were subsequently detected during sentinel testing. The first occurred several weeks after PCV-negative animals were moved under quarantine from the nursery into an animal holding room. The apparent origin of PCV was newly installed stainless steel penning, which was not sufficiently degreased thereby protecting viral particles from disinfection.

There is general consensus that the porcine species is the species of choice, based on a number of factors including that in many organ systems, the physiology of pigs and humans is remarkably similar. Pigs can be bred and maintained in large numbers within enclosed, biosecure facilities, with large litter sizes being in order of ten piglets or more, time to sexual maturity being short (about 6-8 months), and gestation time being less than 4 months. Genetic engineering techniques have been developed and are being used to modify pigs via transgenesis, gene modification, and gene knock-out (KO) technologies 2,3 to reduce immunogenicity and potentially improve safety. In our society, it appears to be ethically acceptable to use pigs as a source of cells, tissues, and organs for medical therapies. [4] [5] [6] As a result of these factors, a porcine-derived replacement pancreatic islet cell xenotransplantation product has now been used in patients with diabetes under national regulatory oversight 7-9 demonstrating both safety and efficacy. 10 There are stringent guidelines issued by regulatory agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the generation and production of pigs for Xenotransplantation. 11 Originally, the term specific (or specified) pathogen free (SPF) as it relates to swine production was not specifically created to help researchers but for pork producers to economically raise healthier animals under the premise that if the disease load can be lightened, better health and growth performance can be achieved. 12 However, higher level and more extensive pathogen exclusion standards have been proposed for designated pathogen free (DPF) herds, 11 with the notable exception of Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV), which due to its ubiquitous presence in the swine genome is risk managed via recipient monitoring, 11, 13, 14 subtype, and transmission potential characterization, 14 and recently potentially via genomewide inactivation. 3 Animals fulfilling DPF status need to be free of infectious pathogens, not only those that affect the health of swine populations, but also those known and unknown agents that have the potential to infect humans and cause infectious disease, that is, having xenozoonotic potential. 11 Examples of the latter category of potential pathogenic agents are porcine lymphotropic \u03b3-herpes virus, hepatitis E, and porcine cytomegalovirus. 13, 15 While no globally standardized DPF excluded agent list exists, there are a number of reports in the literature presenting lists of pathogens that should be eliminated from a DPF herd. [16] [17] [18] To enable this pathogen exclusion, DPF-free swineherds should be genetically closed and reared within biosecure barrier facilities, so-called Source Animal Facilities (SAFs), 11, 18 located distant from any other swine production or transport routes, and isolated from potential pathogen sources via filtered air, filtered and disinfected water, sterilized feed, shower-in and shower-out access for staff, and hygienic measures including thorough screening of employees for potentially transmissible pathogens prior to hiring (Table 1) . To reduce the risk of prion-based diseases, feed and feed components should be traceable and certified free of banned animal proteins or other cattle-derived materials for multiple generations prior to donation. 11 The operations in such a SAF should be according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions. 11 It is also proposed that SAF animal husbandry conditions should follow those for research animals per the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 19 with research facility registration and accreditation by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, in the USA), the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Conclusion: Ten years after PCV clearance following the second outbreak, due to strict adherence to biosecurity protocols and based on ongoing sentinel diagnostic monitoring (currently monthly), the herd remains DPF including PCV negative. One of many agents on established DPF exclusion lists is porcine circovirus (PCV). This is a small, nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus, first identified in 1974 as a contaminant of the porcine PK-15 kidney cell line, and it is the smallest known freely replicating virus in vertebrates. 20 There are two major strains, PCV1 and PCV2 21 along with a newly recognized third strain PCV3 whose significance is still being discovered. 22 PCV1 is not associated with disease, while PCV2 is associated with a spectrum of disease symptoms called porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) 20, 21 first recognized as post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 381, "end": 382, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1327, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1331, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1335, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1572, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1761, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2088, "end": 2090, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2224, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2395, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2399, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2402, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2457, "end": 2459, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2515, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2798, "end": 2800, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2947, "end": 2950, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2951, "end": 2953, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3138, "end": 3142, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3143, "end": 3147, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3148, "end": 3152, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3328, "end": 3331, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3332, "end": 3334, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3903, "end": 3905, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4880, "end": 4882, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 5177, "end": 5180, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 5181, "end": 5183, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3679, "end": 3688, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| INTRODUC TI ON"}, {"text": "Clinical signs include progressive weight loss, lethargy, dark-colored diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, paleness, and jaundice.

PCV2-specific vaccines became commercially available during the mid-2000s and proved efficacious in field trials. 21 In our studies, we used a capsid-based subunit vaccine mar- showed efficacy in experimental studies 32 and field investigations, that is, a reduction in mortality by 50% and increased weight gain upon vaccination of piglets at weaning and 3 weeks later. 33 In one experimental study, effectiveness of immunization of the dam was investigated: Despite formation of antibodies after immunization at 4 weeks of gestation, virus inoculation at 8 weeks did not prevent transmission to the fetus. 34 Importantly, PCV is extremely robust and resistant to disinfection procedures. It is stable at pH 3 and resistant to heat inactivation even up to 120\u00b0C for 30 minutes. 24 It is also resistant to inactivation by chloroform. 35 PCV2 appears more resistant to disinfection than PCV1 where pasteurization for 10 hours at 60\u00b0C and dry-heat treatment for 72 hours at 80\u00b0C had some effect, but no effect was observed for 30-minute dry-heat treatment at 120\u00b0C; however, wet-heat treatment up to 80\u00b0C proved efficacious in virus inactivation. 36 Experimentally, effectiveness in virus titer reduction was observed for disinfectants such as Virkon \u00ae -S, sodium hydroxide, 3%-6% sodium hypochlorite (bleach), Roccal D Plus \u00ae , 1-Stroke Environ \u00ae , Fulsan \u00ae , and Tek-Trol \u00ae ; however, no effectiveness was observed for Nolvasan \u00ae , Neogen DC&R \u00ae , Weladol \u00ae , or ethanol. 37 Bleach is effective, but it is not known whether its use is effective in the field. 38 Iowa State University has published a disinfection protocol to be used in disinfection of pens, which starts with a degreaser detergent followed by decontamination with Virkon \u00ae -S (Antec International, Sudbury, Suffolk, UK) at 1:30 dilution and then fogging with Clidox \u00ae -S (US Pharmacal Com LLC, Erie, CO) at 1:5:1 dilution. 21 Porcine circovirus is on the list of DPF pathogens of exclusion mainly because of its potential impact on the health of pig herds.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 156, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 157, "end": 159, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 295, "end": 297, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 564, "end": 566, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 777, "end": 781, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 787, "end": 791, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 831, "end": 834, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 835, "end": 837, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1073, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1176, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1330, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1567, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1738, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1793, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2104, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2429, "end": 2431, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2516, "end": 2518, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2847, "end": 2849, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUC TI ON"}, {"text": "Its zoonotic potential for man has not been clearly established, as circoviruses have been found in other species but not in humans. 39 Exposure in humans has been claimed by serological testing for antibodies: About 20% of healthy adults and 30% of hospital patients with fever of unknown etiology were found to be antibody positive, 40 but this has not been confirmed in other studies. 41 Also, antibodies to PCV1 or PCV2 proved not detectable in a population of professionals with frequent, close contact to pigs, that is, veterinarians in swine practice. 42 There are indications that the circovirus can infect some selected human cell lines during in vitro coculture, but this infection is non-productive 43 for primary human blood mononuclear cells, and there is conflicting data on susceptibility to in vitro infection. 44, 45 From these data, it appears that the risk of zoonosis of PCV is rather small.

In our experience, despite successful initial introduction of DPF piglets from SPF sows via CDCD during the population phase of a new SAF, we were confronted with two separate PCV outbreaks. These outbreaks were not expected as the CDCD piglets upon release at three weeks of age from quarantine nursery were in all cases free of all DPF listed agents of exclusion. Both PCV outbreaks first occurred after piglets were moved into animal holding rooms. In the first outbreak, it was found that the means of transmission was via the stainless steel penning in animal holding rooms; the second via employee facilitated contamination from a PCV high risk area, the external C-section suite located adjacent to the SAF, which was then transferred by the employee's entry into the barrier and direct contact with PCV-negative, na\u00efve pigs. In both instances, the outbreak was identified quickly and the source of the PCV was ultimately able to be determined, indicating that the diagnostics used were sensitive enough to detect PCV early in the course of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| D ISCUSS I ON"}, {"text": "The first outbreak represents an unusual circumstance but illustrates the extreme robustness of the PCV virus. The stainless steel penning was manufactured at a facility close to a commercial pig herd and employees at the stainless steel manufacturer also had close contact with the nearby swine farm. Some of these individuals also installed the penning with its rust-preventative grease in the barrier prior to its closure after construction. Apparently, in some rooms, the penning was then insufficiently degreased before disinfection, and intact PCV virus was thereby protected by the grease on the stainless steel allowing survival during disinfection using aqueous media. The ensuing physical contact of the piglets and the greasy penning likely then liberated the PCV and initiated the outbreak. The second outbreak was not a tremendous surprise: It was known that each cohort of C-section piglet derivations involved extensive set up, surgical activities, and clean up-each of which was a high risk activity. Careful planning was in place to minimize the potential for personnel to be a vector for transmission, but proved ineffective.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| D ISCUSS I ON"}, {"text": "During the period of both PCV outbreaks, we did not observe any symptom of PCVAD, presumably because the frequent diagnostic testing program enabled the detection of PCV at an early phase post infection and likely also to the absence of other infectious agents which would have contributed to the disease load on the piglets. 23 Of the many pathogens in the DPF excluded agents' list, 11, 14, 16, 17 PCV was in 2007 a pathogen of most concern given its robustness, difficulty to inactivate, uncontrolled epidemic status in the United States with no vaccine available until early 2007, and its potential for vertical transmission in utero. 27, 28 The barrier facility was populated at a time when PCV in the swine industry of the United States was considered ubiquitous and at an epidemic status causing great morbidity and mortality. 20, 21 Half a year before the first piglets were delivered, PCV was first reported positive in the multiplier unit where the donor sows were housed. Therefore, essentially during the phase of populating the DPF barrier, the herd in the multiplier unit was in a first phase of viral contact, active viremia, and seroconversion. Since the start of operations at the multiplier unit in 2005, we had not observed any animal showing PCVAD. Initially,we took no special precautions at the time to specifically prevent PCV entry into the barrier, but were successful in the case of cohort #1. After the first PCV outbreak, PCV-specific preventive measures were taken including testing of sows for PCV viremia at breeding and during pregnancy. Once a vaccine became available, starting with cohort #4, we initiated vaccination of sows used for producing founder animals before and during pregnancy. It is not clear whether vaccination was necessary, but the outcome was successful as none of the piglets delivered to the barrier facility were PCV positive immediately following introduction. Exacerbating the uncertainty of whether vaccination was a necessity are the facts that PCV vaccines are typically developed for first administration at an early life stage, 21, 33 and that vaccination of pregnant sows does not completely prevent infection of piglets via the transplacental route. 34 However, the exclusion of sows exhibiting PCV viremia during pregnancy is supported by the fact that transplacental infection of fetuses is quite likely in such animals. 29, 30 The SAF was designed with separate animal holding rooms, each with its own UV-sterilized water supply, separate single-pass ventilation (with positive or negative differential pressure relative to adjacent spaces), and Danish entry. This compartmentalized, isolation enabling design facilitated successful containment of the outbreak, depopulation of only PCV infected animals in affected animal holding rooms, disinfection, and repopulation without requiring the depopulation of adjacent, unaffected rooms within the barrier. Interestingly, we obtained infrequent PCR-positive environmental swab sample results from the empty, quarantined rooms despite repeated cleaning and disinfection. However, when sentinel animals were brought in the room, and PCV did not emerge in these animals, it indicated that the PCR-positive results might have detected remaining DNA fragments from non-infectious virus. We concluded that the design of the facility, with completely separate and isolatable animal holding rooms, worked in this approach to contain a potentially devastating infectious outbreak and prevent its spread.
