The aBS-REL tree was used as the input tree for the LSD (least-squares dating) software (v0.2) (To et al. 2016) to obtain divergence dates. Confidence intervals were estimated by using a latin hypercube sampling scheme (LHC) from the aBS-REL parameter distributions (Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond 2011). Briefly, 500 samples were drawn from aBS-REL analyses to estimate branch length variance, 500 trees were generated, and then used as input trees for LSD. The upper and the lower 95% bounds were used as confidence intervals.",

Because the Murinae and Cricetidae families diverged \u223c20 Ma (Steppan and Schenk 2017), the hypothesis of cospeciation implies that the OW and NW mammarenavirus lineages also separated in very ancient times. We thus decided to formally test this possibility using molecular dating. A common problem associated with molecular dating, especially for fast-evolving viruses, is the time-dependent variation in evolutionary rates (Duchene et al. 2014). In fact, for most viruses (and other organisms), evolutionary rates appear to scale negatively with the timeframe of measurement. This phenomenon often results in severe underestimation of the age of viral lineages and is strongly associated with purifying selection (i.e., the elimination of deleterious mutations) and substitution saturation (i.e., the occurrence of multiple substitutions at the same position) (Duchene et al. 2014). This is because transient deleterious mutations inflate short-term rate estimates, whereas saturation (which decreases the measured substitution rate) is more likely to occur over long timeframes.",

Previous studies indicated that recombination events at the 3\u2032 end of GPC occurred in the ancestor of Northern American NW viruses (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. 2016). Our failure to detect recombination in this region may derive from the fact that we filtered some codons or from the choice to separately analyze GPC and NP, thus reducing the power to detect phylogenetic inconsistency. Indeed, we obtained different phylogenies for GPC and NP (fig. 4A). However, GARD analysis was performed to avoid the inflation of positive selection inference caused by unrecognized recombination. Because we detected no positive selection acting on GPC (see below) the issue of recombination was not explored further.\n",

            "text": "Under the cospeciation hypothesis, mammarenaviruses were implicitly thought to have emerged in Asia, where rodents also originated, and to have migrated to Europe, Africa, and the Americas with their hosts (Gonzalez et al. 2007). Even accounting for virus extinction events, this scenario does not explain why mammarenaviruses other than LCMV have never been detected in European rodents (Blasdell et al. 2008; Ledesma et al. 2009; Yama et al. 2012; Forbes et al. 2014) and Asian mammarenaviruses were assigned an African origin in the analyses herein. Indeed, the inferred time of origin for the WENV/LORV lineage (ranges: 5,674\u2013454 ya) is in theory consistent with human-mediated introduction: trade routes connecting Asia and the Eastern African coasts were already active around the first century CE, and resulted in the exchange of goods, plants, and animals, including rodents (Beaujard 2007; Boivin et al. 2013). Unfortunately, we were unable to reconstruct the geographic origin of mammarenaviruses and our data do not explain how these viruses came to infect rodents in Africa and the Americas. One possibility is that OW and NW mammarenaviruses originated from a common ancestor that was present in both continents. A reptilian arenavirus may be an appealing candidate, as some reptarenaviruses can infect mammalian cells in laboratory settings (Hetzel et al. 2013; Hepojoki, Kipar, et al. 2015; Abba 2016). However, data on the origin, diversity, and geographic range of reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses are presently missing and these viruses have only been detected in captive snakes. This latter observation raises the possibility that reptilian viruses originated by the recent cross-species transmission of mammarenaviruses via ingestion of supplied infected rodents. This is highly unlikely, though, as reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses differ considerably from each other and substantially from mammarenaviruses (Stenglein et al. 2012, 2015; Bodewes et al. 2013; Hetzel et al. 2013; Hepojoki, Salmenper\u00e4, et al. 2015). In the arenavirus phylogeny, reptarenaviruses and mammarenaviruses form sister clades, with hartmaniviruses creating the most basal lineage (Hepojoki, Salmenper\u00e4, et al. 2015). Thus, as previously noted (Hetzel et al. 2013), if transmission to snakes occurred from a mammalian host, this must have happened long ago, leading to the diversification of the three virus genera. An alternative possibility is that both mammalian and reptilian arenaviruses originated from multiple transmissions from one or more unknown reservoirs. Although mammarenaviruses have been mainly detected in rodents, TCRV was described in bats (Downs et al. 1963) and WENV was isolated from both rodents and shrews, suggesting that it has a relatively broad host range (Li et al. 2015). These observations imply that additional mammalian hosts (and arenaviruses) may exists and that the prevalent association with rodents may derive from biased ascertainment in rodents and undersampling of nonrodent mammals. Addressing this possibility will need extensive field work to characterize arenavirus diversity in different hosts and geographic areas.",

Both time frames and geographic ranges were based on extant strains and may therefore be affected by sampling biases and incomplete knowledge of mammarenavirus diversity (e.g., from geographic areas that have been underinvestigated). These problems may be particularly severe for LCMV, as this is the only mammarenavirus to be detected in multiple continents, most likely by virtue of its association with commensal house mice. However, available LCMV sequences were mostly sampled in United States and Europe, with only two sequences from Asia (both from Japan). The tMRCA of LCMV strains we obtained (6,742\u2013694 ya) is roughly consistent with previous estimates (5,000\u20133,000 ya; Albari\u00f1o et al. 2010), and phylogeography placed the origin of this virus in Northern America. It is clearly difficult to imagine how an ancestral African mammarenavirus could reach the NW before human transatlantic travel was developed, unless a nonrodent host was involved. Thus, extensive sampling of LCMV sequences from different continents may reveal a different geographic origin for this virus. Notably, a recent search for LCMV in Gabon showed that the virus was introduced in the country, most likely with its rodent host, from America (N\u2019Dilimabaka et al. 2015). Although LCMV sampling in Africa is still limited, these data suggest that an ancestral African mammarenavirus migrated and speciated via geographical isolation into LCMV, to be reintroduced into the continent more recently.",

For these reasons, they are unlikely to affect phylogeographic analyses and inference of positive selection. Concerning molecular dating, it is worth noting that the date of sample isolation does not necessarily correspond to the time (and consequently technique) of sequencing. For instance, several old LCMV isolates were sequenced in 2010 from stocks (Albari\u00f1o et al. 2010); likewise, PICV, AMAV, WWAV, and MACV isolates from the Sixties and Seventies were sequenced in 2007\u20132008 (Cajimat et al. 2007; Lan et al. 2008) or recently deposited in GenBank as part of a large BioProject (PRJNA257008).

            "text": "An interesting possibility is that changes in L modulate mammarenavirus virulence, which may in turn contribute to the establishment of new reservoir host populations. Indeed, mammarenaviruses seem to display relatively broad host ranges. Several OW and NW mammarenaviruses infect humans and evidence of mammarenavirus infection was reported in animal species other than the natural reservoirs (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. 2016). In addition, models for arenavirus infections have been established in rodents distinct from the natural hosts, as well as in nonhuman primates (Golden et al. 2015). However, at least in experimental settings, mammarenavirus infection of nonnatural hosts often result in a severe pathology and even lethality (Golden et al. 2015). Optimal natural reservoirs, though, tolerate infection with limited consequence, thus contributing to viral maintenance in the population. Thus, changes in the polymerase may be required to finely tune viral persistence and virulence after host switches. In OW mammarenaviruses, changes in the L protein were previously associated with differential replication efficiency and different disease phenotypes in rodents (Matloubian et al. 1993; Bergthaler et al. 2010; Ng et al. 2011). For instance, rapid viral replication in the early phases of infection was shown to be central for the establishment of a persistent infection for some LCMV strains (Bergthaler et al. 2010; Sullivan et al. 2015). In the case of Pichind\u00e9 virus, a NW mammarenavirus used as a model for LASV pathogenesis, three amino acid substitutions in the polymerase account for the different phenotype of two laboratory strains (McLay et al. 2013). The P18 strain causes fatal disease in guinea pigs, whereas a related strain (P2) only causes a febrile disease with modest weight loss. The different virulence is a consequence of increased efficiency of P18 viral genomic replication (McLay et al. 2013).",

They found a consistent number of interactors, including components of the innate immune response such as TRIM21, DDX3X, and NKRF. Consistently, in vitro inhibition of these proteins affected LCMV propagation, and two weeks after intravenous inoculation, Trim21\u2212/\u2212 mice had higher viral titers than wild-type animals (Khamina et al. 2017). Although the significance of these findings during natural infections remains to be evaluated, these results indicate that positive selection at mammarenavirus L proteins might result from interaction with the host immune system. In line with this view, a recent work also indicated that the L protein of Mopeia virus can activate the RLR/MAVS signaling pathway, possibly via the production of small RNAs (Zhang et al. 2016). Such activation results in the induction of type I IFN responses. Different mammarenaviruses and even different strains of the same virus elicit distinct immune responses (Pannetier et al. 2004; Hayes et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2012, 2015; Meyer and Ly 2016). Whereas the role of mammarenavirus NP and Z proteins as modulators of the IFN system are established (Martinez-Sobrido et al. 2007; Xing et al. 2015), whether and to which degree these differences are determined by adaptive changes in the L protein remain open issues.",
