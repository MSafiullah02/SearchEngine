            "text": "operating room, these complications may be associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Although high quality studies comparing outcomes in the operating room with those in locations outside of the operating room are lacking, 1 US closed claims data have shown that complication rates and adverse outcomes are higher when anesthesia care, including procedural sedation, is delivered in remote locations. 2 This position paper describes best practices and establishes guidelines applicable to anesthesiologists and anesthesia care teams for administering safe procedural sedation both within and outside the operating room, including out-of-hospital facilities. It also recognizes that many medical and dental professionals are presently providing sedation services. Recent Canadian closed claims data for all sedation providers have identified that serious adverse events and patient harm related to procedural sedation do occur, even in the hands of experienced anesthesiologists. 3 Contributing factors include inadequate assessment, medication selection, lack of situational awareness, and deficiencies in procedural and post-procedural monitoring with failure to recognize airway and respiratory compromise. Formal curricula with a demonstration of competency in procedural sedation have been recommended as an essential component of anesthesia training programs. 4 The principles outlined in this document can also be applied by non-anesthesia sedation providers, although such professionals may wish to evaluate their compliance in accordance with their own professional guidelines or those of the healthcare facility. The CAS strongly advocates that all sedation providers be held to a comparably rigorous and prudent set of guidelines but also acknowledges that some differences in practice may exist between anesthesia and non-anesthesia sedation providers. We strongly recommend that, within a specific institution, consideration be given to developing procedural sedation guidelines or policies, ideally through a multidisciplinary committee representative of all sedation providers and stakeholders, including anesthesiologists. 5 Anesthesiologists are experts in delivering safe procedural sedation, and anesthesia departments should therefore, to the extent that their resources permit, endeavor to provide planned and emergency sedation services to the facility. Anesthesiologists should encourage upholding the highest possible institutional sedation standards and, again, as resources permit, support the education of sedation providers and sedation assistants throughout their facility. The concept of facility sedation teams, often led by anesthesiology, is growing in popularity, particularly for the delivery of pediatric sedation services, 6 as they have the benefit of increasing the availability and mobility of sedation services as well as promoting ongoing education and skill acquisition of team members.",

Anesthesiologists and anesthesia assistants are familiar with the pharmacology and properties of these agents and are experienced in their use. The CAS does support several fundamental principles that should be applied by all sedation providers in any setting. The overarching principle of procedural sedation is that one should use the minimum intervention possible with due consideration given to the specific procedure and patient. In general, medication should be administered in small divided doses or by continuous infusion titrated to clinical effect, allowing sufficient time to appreciate the peak depth of sedation achieved and accounting for variations in the amount of pain and procedural stimulation. Knowledge of each medication's time of onset, peak effect, and duration of effect is essential. When multiple medications are utilized, particularly with opioids, it is essential to consider the potential synergistic effects on the level of sedation and the increased risk for respiratory depression. Where feasible, local or regional anesthesia should be strongly considered in addition to sedation for particularly painful procedures. Various combinations of medication can be used to administer procedural sedation and they should ideally be short acting and titratable. Increasingly, the potent sedative-hypnotic agents, specifically propofol, have become popular with both anesthesiologists and non-anesthesiologists to provide excellent moderate or deep procedural sedation with high patient satisfaction rates and a more rapid recovery profile than some other combinations of medication.",

Discharge readiness should be assessed by validated discharge criteria, such as the modified Aldrete score 17 for Phase 1 recovery when discharging a patient from the recovery room to another healthcare institutional location, or the postanesthetic discharge scoring system for Phase 2 recovery 18 when discharging the patient home (Table 2 ). If the patient is to be discharged home, the most responsible physician or delegated alternate physician must be available to attend to the patient until the institutionally set standards for discharge are met.

Ces effets sont diff\u00e9rents \u00e0 la fois de l'anesth\u00e9sie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui entra\u00eene un \u00e9tat de perte de conscience totale et de l'analg\u00e9sie pure qui assure une diminution ou une absence de sensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la douleur sans n\u00e9cessairement s'accompagner d'une r\u00e9duction ou d'une perte de la conscience. L'utilisation limit\u00e9e de m\u00e9dicaments antalgiques est fr\u00e9quente au cours de la s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale. Les plus fortes doses n\u00e9cessaires pour des proc\u00e9dures tr\u00e8s douloureuses peuvent \u00eatre dangereuses et dans ce cas il y a sans doute lieu d'envisager d'autres options, telles que l'anesth\u00e9sie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Sachant que les effets secondaires ne sont pas rares avec la s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale, la personne en charge de la s\u00e9dation doit s\u00e9lectionner les patients de mani\u00e8re scrupuleuse et effectuer une \u00e9valuation compl\u00e8te de ces derniers avant la proc\u00e9dure. Ces prestataires doivent \u00eatre vigilants et pr\u00eats \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 des complications potentielles, telles qu'une d\u00e9pression respiratoire, une obstruction des voies respiratoires et une hypox\u00e9mie. Il est important de rappeler qu'en dehors d'une salle d'op\u00e9ration, ces complications peuvent \u00eatre associ\u00e9es \u00e0 un risque plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de morbidit\u00e9 et de mortalit\u00e9. Bien que l'on manque d'\u00e9tudes de grande qualit\u00e9 comparant les r\u00e9sultats en salle d'op\u00e9ration \u00e0 ceux obtenus dans d'autres environnements, 1 des donn\u00e9es am\u00e9ricaines (\u00c9 tats-Unis) sur des cas des plaintes judiciaires r\u00e9solues ont montr\u00e9 que les taux de complications et d'effets ind\u00e9sirables sont plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s quand les soins anesth\u00e9siques, y compris la s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale, sont d\u00e9livr\u00e9s dans des environnements isol\u00e9s. 2 Cet expos\u00e9 de principe d\u00e9crit les meilleures pratiques et \u00e9tablit des lignes directrices s'appliquant aux anesth\u00e9siologistes et aux \u00e9quipes de soins anesth\u00e9siques pour l'administration d'une s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale s\u00e9curitaire \u00e0 la fois dans et en-dehors de la salle d'op\u00e9ration, y compris dans des \u00e9tablissements ext\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. Il reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement que de nombreux professionnels m\u00e9dicaux et dentaires fournissent actuellement des services de s\u00e9dation. Des donn\u00e9es canadiennes r\u00e9centes sur des plaintes judiciaires r\u00e9solues concernant les diff\u00e9rents prestataires de s\u00e9dation ont identifi\u00e9 que des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ind\u00e9sirables et des l\u00e9sions graves des patients en rapport avec une s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale arrivent effectivement, m\u00eame entre les mains d'anesth\u00e9siologistes exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s. 3 Les facteurs contributifs sont, notamment, une \u00e9valuation insuffisante, le choix du m\u00e9dicament, l'absence de prise de conscience de la gravit\u00e9 de la situation et les insuffisances de suivi pendant et apr\u00e8s la proc\u00e9dure, avec la non-reconnaissance de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la ventilation et de l'\u00e9tat des voies respiratoires. Des programmes d'\u00e9tudes formelles avec une d\u00e9monstration de la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9s comme une composante essentielle des programmes de formation en anesth\u00e9sie. 4 Les principes d\u00e9crits dans ce document peuvent \u00e9galement s'appliquer \u00e0 des prestataires de s\u00e9dation non-anesth\u00e9siologistes, bien que ces professionnels puissent souhaiter \u00e9valuer leur conformit\u00e9 avec leurs propres lignes directrices professionnelles ou celles de leur \u00e9tablissement de soins de sant\u00e9. La SCA encourage fortement tous les prestataires de s\u00e9dation \u00e0 s'en tenir \u00e0 un ensemble comparablement prudent et rigoureux de recommandations, mais reconna\u00eet aussi qu'il peut exister des diff\u00e9rences de pratiques entre les prestataires de s\u00e9dation anesth\u00e9siologistes et non-anesth\u00e9siologistes. Nous pr\u00e9conisons fortement qu'au sein d'un \u00e9tablissement donn\u00e9, il soit s\u00e9rieusement envisag\u00e9 d'\u00e9laborer des lignes directrices ou des r\u00e8gles pour la s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale, id\u00e9alement par un comit\u00e9 multidisciplinaire repr\u00e9sentant tous les prestataires de s\u00e9dations et les acteurs, y compris les anesth\u00e9siologistes. 5 Les anesth\u00e9siologistes sont les experts pour ce qui est de d\u00e9livrer une s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale s\u00e9curitaire et les d\u00e9partements d'anesth\u00e9sie devraient donc, dans la mesure o\u00f9 leurs ressources le permettent, s'efforcer de fournir des services de s\u00e9dation \u00e9lective et d'urgence dans leur \u00e9tablissement. Les anesth\u00e9siologistes doivent encourager le maintien de normes de s\u00e9dation le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 possible dans leurs \u00e9tablissements et, encore une fois, dans la mesure de leurs ressources, soutenir l'\u00e9ducation des prestataires et assistants de s\u00e9dation dans l'ensemble de leur \u00e9tablissement. Le concept d'\u00e9quipes institutionnelles de s\u00e9dation, souvent men\u00e9es par un anesth\u00e9siologiste, gagne en popularit\u00e9 notamment pour la prestation de services de s\u00e9dation en p\u00e9diatrie, 6 car elles ont l'avantage d'augmenter la disponibilit\u00e9 et la mobilit\u00e9 des services de s\u00e9dation, et aussi de promouvoir l'\u00e9ducation continue et l'acquisition d'habilet\u00e9s pour les membres de l'\u00e9quipe.",

D'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le m\u00e9dicament doit \u00eatre administr\u00e9 en petites doses ou en perfusion continue dos\u00e9e pour l'obtention de l'effet clinique, laissant suffisamment de temps pour \u00e9valuer la profondeur maximum de la s\u00e9dation obtenue et prenant en compte les variations du niveau de douleur et de stimulation li\u00e9es \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure. Il est essentiel de conna\u00eetre le d\u00e9lai d'action, l'effet maximum et la dur\u00e9e d'action de chaque m\u00e9dicament. Quand plusieurs m\u00e9dicaments sont utilis\u00e9s (notamment en association avec des opio\u00efdes), il est essentiel de tenir compte des effets synergiques possibles sur le niveau de s\u00e9dation et du risque accru de d\u00e9pression respiratoire. Lorsque cela est possible, une anesth\u00e9sie locale ou r\u00e9gionale doit \u00eatre fortement envisag\u00e9e en plus de la s\u00e9dation pour les proc\u00e9dures particuli\u00e8rement douloureuses. Diff\u00e9rentes combinaisons de m\u00e9dicaments peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour administrer une s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale et il devrait s'agir, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, de m\u00e9dicaments pouvant \u00eatre titr\u00e9s et \u00e0 courte dur\u00e9e d'action. Des agents s\u00e9datifs-hypnotiques puissants (en particulier le propofol) sont de plus en plus souvent adopt\u00e9s par les anesth\u00e9siologistes et les nonanesth\u00e9siologistes pour fournir une s\u00e9dation proc\u00e9durale mod\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 profonde d'excellente qualit\u00e9 avec des taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de satisfaction du patient et un profil de r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration plus rapide qu'avec d'autres combinaisons m\u00e9dicamenteuses.",
