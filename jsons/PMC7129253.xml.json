Moreover, there was no quantification of the viral load or detection of bacterial co\u2010infection. The specific microarray assay that was used has limited published clinical validation, especially in the paediatric population. A significant number of RSVA\u2013RSVB co\u2010infections were detected that need further exploration with specific RT\u2010PCR assays to confirm the specificity of the assay for these viral subtypes. Additionally, the assay may underestimate the presence of some viruses like coronaviruses because it can detect only Coronavirus subtype 229E. In a significant proportion of children that present with symptoms of respiratory infection, no viral or bacterial pathogen can be detected by conventional or molecular methods. This implies that either molecular methods need further improvement for their sensitivity or there are still other viruses to be discovered.",
