Initial flaws in methodology resulted in an overestimation of influenza incidence due to search queries being overly influenced by media publicity rather than disease activity (Lazer et al., 2014). Newer algorithms are now being tested that take better account of such confounding factors (Santillana et al., 2014), and GT can now show major news stories on the same time line.

In this study, we use GT to identify the geographical and seasonal trends in three tickborne diseases, (Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)) and one fungal disease, (coccidioidomycosis). Such diseases are highly relevant to dermatologists who may be the first ones to diagnose them via their cutaneous manifestations (Supplementary Table S1 online\n). We then compare this with traditional Center for Disease Control (CDC) data on actual disease events, which we hypothesized will correlate with search data and thereby demonstrate the utility of this resource for tracking and predicting these dermatologically relevant infectious diseases.",

Unlike the tickborne diseases, coccidioidomycosis does not have a seasonal incidence peak according to the CDC data. Fittingly, our analysis showed only a weak seasonal correlation (r=0.4169) between GT and CDC data (Table 1). This result is likely due to the much larger data set we have analyzed, allowing even subtle correlations to be elicited. If we reduce our data to look at only 1 year, all of the tickborne seasonal data remain significant (P<0.05, for 2012 only), but coccidioidomycosis data then does not reach statistical significance (e.g., P=0.14; 2012 analyzed alone).",
