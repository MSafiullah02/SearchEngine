            "text": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) are an oxygen-rich class of inorganic cluster systems that exhibit remarkable chemical and physical properties, and have many promising applications in various fields, such as for catalysis, materials and medicines [[1], [2], [3]]. Recently, numerous reviews have discussed the design and properties of hybrid POMs in a range of systems, such as polymeric materials [4,5], surfactants [6], photocatalysts for mustard [7] and dye degradation [8], electron transport layers [9], enzyme mimics [10], and photoelectrochemical applications [11,12]. POM-based hybrid materials of current interest are summarized by Sullivan et al. in Fig. 1\n. [13]. POMs exert significant biological activities, with high efficacy and low toxicity. Moreover, the sizes and globular structure of many POMs are similar to some water-soluble fullerene derivatives that show excellent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity [14,15]. With regards to the biological activity of the POMs, many literature reports describe the activity of polyoxometalates with Keggin, lacunary Keggin, Wells-Dawson, double-Keggin and Keggin-sandwich structures against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [16], Helicobacter pylori [17], SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [18] and Cancer [19].",

            "text": "Keggin-type POM change color when they are reduced. So, if a chemical warfare agent (CWA) with an oxidizable group, such as the sulfur atom in sulfur mustard (HD), was to come into contact with the POM solution, the POM would be reduced (and the HD oxidized). As the reduced POM (POMRed) and the oxidized POM (POMOx) are of different colors, the wearer would therefore have a simple indicator or warning of the presence of the CWA [[20], [21], [22]]. Recent reports have described the immobilization of POMs and transition metal-substituted POMs on various supports, including porous silica [23], carbon [24,25], metal\u2013organic frameworks [26], titania [27], polymers [28,29] and organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials [30,31], through an organic linker, and explored their use in various organic transformations. Organically-modified silicates (Ormosils) are organic\u2013inorganic materials formed by the hydrolysis and condensation of organically-modified silanes with traditional alkoxide precursors. In the literature survey, Ormosil materials have already been found to have many promising applications in the fields of optics, electronics, mechanics, energy, environment, biology and medicine [[32], [33], [34]]. Ormosils have been shown to be excellent hosts for trapping nanoparticles of metals [35,36] owing to their ability to act as stabilizers or surface-capping agents.",

They have proved kill a broad range of microorganisms with a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. Ormosil is rich of chelating sites, as \u2013OH and \u2013NH groups, that can interact with POMs. This study described a simple method for immobilizing POMs in aminosilane-modified silicate to prepare the Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM hybrids, and investigated the microstructures, physical properties, antibacterial activities, and ability to decompose 2-chloroethylethylsulfide (CEES). Zone of inhibition testing, MIC, MBC and the plate-counting method were used in this study to examine the antibacterial activities against Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and E. coli JM109, and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). Furthermore, the adsorption and oxidation reactions in the detoxification of CEES on the hybrids were studied using the NMR technique and the reaction mechanism was delineated. Moreover, the Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM hybrids with adsorption and antibacterial efficacies were incorporated into fabric matrices by impregnation to create antibacterial fabrics. Most textile materials currently used in hospitals and hotels are conducive to cross-infection or the transmission of diseases caused by microorganisms. The manufacture of dressings for medical and hygienic use has become an important area in the textile industry. These antibacterial fabrics were sterile and could be useful for wound-healing [37] and as antibacterial materials to prevent or minimize infection with pathogenic bacteria [38].",

The POM used in this work, H5PV2Mo10O40, was of a type that contains a redox-active heteroatom. These bands are generally assigned to charge transfer from the bridging oxygen to the metal in polyoxometalates [41]. The UV\u2013Vis spectra showed broad peaks that shifted to higher wavelengths for the hybrids, which was attributed to the POM binding to the surface of the Ormosil system. 31P MAS-NMR is a useful tool for detecting the local environment of the POM, as the chemical shift of the phosphorous atom depends not only on its local environment within the metal cluster, but also on factors such as associated water molecules, metal ions and solid supports. The POM solid-state MAS 31P NMR exhibited two sharp and intense peaks at \u22123.64 and \u22124.06 ppm, along with shoulders at \u22122.93 and \u22124.43 ppm, typical of Keggin structures [42]. The main peak indicated the presence of P in a highly-uniform environment in a hydrated structure of POM. The small shoulders at \u22122.93 and \u22124.43 ppm were due to the presence of some P atoms in environments with differing degrees of hydration [43]. After supporting the POM on Ormosil and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212), the 31P NMR signals broadened considerably, and the main peak shifted to \u03b4 = \u22124.92 and \u22124.52 ppm, respectively. Moreover, one new characteristic peak appeared at 1.26 and 1.39 ppm for Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM, respectively. These results indicated that the local environments of the P atoms in the POM had changed. The shift of the resonance signal suggested some destruction of the heteropoly anion. Thus, the broadness and new 31P NMR resonances of the hybrids could be attributed to significant distortion of the heteropoly anion symmetry, and the long-range order created by water molecules in the hydrated state was lost due to a chemical interaction between the POM anion and the mesoporous Ormosil system [22].",

POM and \u2013NR4\n+Cl\u2212 were closely related to the antibacterial activity, which depended on the content in Ormosil. The antimicrobial mechanism of \u2013NR4\n+Cl\u2212 has been studied extensively. Antimicrobial action in water is usually achieved on contact via the following sequence of elementary processes: adsorption onto the microbial cell surface, diffusion through the cell wall, binding and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane, and release of cytoplasmic constituents resulting in cell death [44]. The mechanism of the antibacterial activity of POM was considered to be as follows: fluorescent X-ray analysis results showed uptake of POM into the bacterial cells. The Gram strains take the hydrophilic compounds into the periplasmic space through the porin protein, which is a pore-forming protein, working towards penetration of the hydrophilic compound into the outer membrane [45].",

Bacterial colonies of Gram-positive S. aureus were completely killed with 80 and 60 mg of Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM, respectively. Another, the dynamics of bacterial growth were also monitored with 4.7 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL S. aureus and with 80 mg/3 mL broth of hybrids under different inoculation durations. Bacterial colonies of S. aureus were completely killed after 36 and 24 h with Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM, respectively. Fig. 8, Fig. 9\nshow the numbers of bacterial colonies grown on MH plates as a function of the number of laundry cycles of fabric-Ormosil/POM and fabric-Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM when approximately 3.5 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL of S. aureus were applied to the plates. After 0\u201320 laundry cycles, the reduction in bacteria was larger than 99.9% against the S. aureus resistant strain after 4 h of incubation, and the percentage reduction of bacteria was approximately 100% after 24 h of incubation. From the results of Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, it appeared that these Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM hybrids possessed good antibacterial action and were effective in reducing bacterial growth with 0\u201320 laundry cycles, possibly due to the uniform and fine distribution of POM particles on the surface of the Ormosil system. Another, the antibacterial activity of the dynamics of bacterial growth was also in the order Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM > Ormosil/POM, same with the results of the MIC and MBC.",

The results showed that CEES had \u03b4 values of 14.8 (C-1), 26.1 (C-2), 33.7 (C-3) and 43.0 ppm (C-4). For the CEES+POM mixture, CEES decomposition after 24 h led to the production of sulfoxide (CEESO), surface-bound alkoxy species (POM\u2013CH2CH2SC2H5) and residual CEES. The solution 13C NMR results showed that CEESO had \u03b4 values of 6.8 (C-5), 36.9 (C-6), 46.1 (C-7) and 54.2 ppm (C-8) [22], and residual CEES was also identified, with \u03b4 values at 14.8, 26.1, 33.7 and 43.0 ppm. The spectra showed peaks at 14.8 (C-1), 26.1 (C-2), 33.7 (C-3) and 29.8 ppm (C-9), which indicated that CEES was adsorbed on the POM to form a surface-bound alkoxy species. POM (H5PV2Mo10O40) detection of sulfides (e.g., CEES) can be explained by Eq. (1). The POM oxidizes the sulfur atom of the sulfide, yielding POMRed and the oxidized form of the sulfoxide (CEESO) [21]. These results indicated the presence of oxidation and nucleophilic substitution reactions on the surface of the POM during decontamination.(1)\n",

For the surface alkoxy complexes, we assumed that the POM offered electron-rich Ot groups and facilitated adsorption and grafting of CEES molecules via a nucleophilic substitution of the chloride. For the Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM hybrids, no oxidation product was observed, which may be due to the low ratio of POM in the hybrids as compared with neat POM. Thus, with the Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM hybrids, CEES decomposition after 24 h led to the production of surface-bound alkoxy species (POM\u2013CH2CH2SC2H5) and residual CEES.",

The antibacterial activity of the hybrids was of the order Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM > Ormosil/POM > Ormosil. The Ormosil structure and negatively-charged anion characteristics of the POM were important in the antibacterial activity against Gram microbes. The POM was capable of reacting with CEES to form sulfoxide (CEESO) and surface-bound alkoxy species (POM\u2013CH2CH2SC2H5). The Ormosil/POM and Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM hybrids were capable of decomposing the adsorbed CEES to form surface-bound alkoxy species (POM\u2013CH2CH2SC2H5). Thus, for the analyzed POM-doped Ormosil it was demonstrated an ability to detoxify chemical/biological toxicant by breaking down their chemical structure and destroy of bacterial growth, respectively. This type of association is novel and has great potential for use as a protective material against simulants of chemical and biological toxicant. In the future, different type of Ormosil(NR4\n+Cl\u2212)/POM structures with antibacterial and detoxification of chemical toxicant will be research.",
