Penfield et al. reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 3/11 placental 93 samples from COVID 19 positive women. None of the infants tested positive or demonstrated 94 symptoms. 6 95 To our knowledge, ours is the first report of cases of positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in mother, 96 neonate and placental tissues. The RNA ISH assay gave us the possibility of direct visualization of 97 the virus, evaluating the molecular target SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA while retaining tissue 98 morphology, a feature that is lost in other methods such as PCR. The RNAscope probe detected 99 positive staining for COVID-19 viral RNA in the infected tissues but not in the uninfected placentas 100 demonstrating the specificity of RNAscope probes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the 101 syncytiothrophoblast signifies presence of the virus on the fetal side. 102 Conclusions 103 This is the first study describing SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the fetal side of the placenta in two cases of 104 mothers infected with COVID-19 and with neonates also positive for the virus at birth. These 105 findings support the possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for 106 COVID-19 infection, from the mother to the baby in utero. 107 Moreover, the direct visualization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the infected placentas raise the 108 possibility of estimating the viral load in cells with morphological context.

The34 following probe was used : V-nCoV2019-S, 848568, NC_045512.2, 20 pairs, nt 21631-23303. The 35 RNAscope 2.5 LSX Reagent Kit-Brown IVD Automation (Leica BOND III ) was used according 36 to the manufacturer's instructions. FFPE tissue section samples were prepared according to 37 manufacturer's recommendations. Each sample was quality controlled for RNA integrity with a 38 probe specific to the housekeeping genes UBC (Ubiquitin C) and PPIB (Cyclophilin B). Negative 39 control background staining was evaluated using a probe specific to the bacterial dapB gene. Each 40 punctate dot signal representing a single target RNA molecule could be detected with standard light 5, 2020 and April 21, 2020 twenty-two women affected by COVID-19 infection 44 delivered at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy. 45 Two of the 22 neonates, born from COVID-19 mothers, resulted positive for PCR of NP swab.",
