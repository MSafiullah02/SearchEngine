            "text": "Respiratory viruses (RVs) are known to constitute a large burden in community-acquired respiratory infections [1], [2], [3], [4]. With regards to nosocomial infections, RVs (excluding herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)) have traditionally been paid little attention, except in hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant recipients [5], [6]. Although hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the second most common nosocomial infection in the developed countries and is associated with high mortality and morbidity [7], [8], it has always been seen to be driven by bacteria, with no role of RVs [9]. However, in a recent South Korean study 22.5% of cases of HAP were related to viral infections, and 59.5% to bacterial infections. This finding, showing a non-negligible role of viruses, can be explained by recent improvements in detection methods and needs to be explored further. Indeed, improvements in the sensitivity of detection techniques such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) have greatly enhanced the ability to detect RVs [10], [11]. However, data on the frequency and role of RVs in HAPs and especially their outcome are still scarce. Apart from influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses are not usually investigated because of weak evidence of their pathogenicity, lack of available treatment, and the high cost of mPCR tests. Furthermore, the role of viral-bacterial coinfection is still unclear in pneumonia and all of the few investigations using mPCR were conducted on community-acquired pneumonia presenting viral-bacterial coinfection and yielded divergent data on pathogenicity and prognosis [2], [12], [13], [14].",

Patients with community-acquired pneumonia or with a diagnosis other than pneumonia were excluded. Only adult patients diagnosed with HAP who underwent screening for RVs at the time of suspected pneumonia were included in the study. When multiple episodes of HAP occurred in the same patient, only the first episode was taken into consideration. Patients included were classified in one of the following four groups according to the microorganisms identified from specimens collected within 72 h after the diagnosis of pneumonia: virus only, bacteria only, virus/bacteria and no pathogens. Of note, the use of mPCR for respiratory virus screening in the ICU of the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital is not systematic and is left at physician\u2019s discretion. Its use that started in 2013 and was at first limited to immunocompromised patients has progressively expanded over the years. We compared characteristics of those who did not undergo screening for RVs to those who underwent and were included in the study. For this we identified the total number of HAP that occurred during the study period in the ICU using the primary diagnosis coded according to the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10).",

The prior mPCR was negative in seven patients (7/15, 47%) who underwent it on average 15 (Standard Deviation (SD) 6.4) days before HAP diagnosis. These patients were considered to have acquired RVs in the hospital. Their characteristics and outcomes are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Five of the cases occurred in ICU ventilated patients and two in non-ventilated patients from a long-term care facility. Identified viruses were RSV (n = 3), parainfluenza (n = 2), metapneumovirus (n = 1) and influenza (n = 1) and 4/7 cases were virus only infection. No grouped cases among these seven patients were identified.",

It is becoming clear that similar interactions may occur with other RVs, including RSV, human metapneumovirus, and possibly rhinovirus or parainfluenza virus [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. However, clinical evidence from prospective studies on the role of coinfection in severity is somewhat conflicting [2], [14], [25], [26]. In our study it should be underlined that all eight HAP cases with long-term shedding of community-acquired viruses involved immunocompromised patients with coinfection with other pathogens. Shedding of rhinoviruses for more than 4 weeks is not uncommon even in immunocompetent individuals [27] and especially in patients with immunodeficiency in whom chronic rhinovirus carriage for as long as 4\u201312 months has been documented [28]. The significance of rhinovirus detection in respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients is a subject of some debate. Some findings have demonstrated that rhinovirus infection alters the respiratory microbiome and may precipitate secondary bacterial infections in patients with COPD [29], [30].",

Second, during the study period, mPCR testing for RVs was not systematic in the ICU, but was left instead to the clinician\u2019s discretion, which may have led to selection bias and to an underestimation of the total number of cases of HAP in admitted patients to the ICU or occurring in the ICU. We tried to overcome this issue by estimating the total number of HAP during the study period and comparing characteristics of patients with HAP who underwent RVs screening and those who did not. The group of patients who underwent RVs screening were more frequently immunocompromised. Third, the 48-h delay traditionally used for the definition of nosocomial cases is derived from data concerning bacteria. This delay may not be appropriate for RVs for which incubation and shedding data are still partial in these populations and can differ from one virus to another. Most authors agree to a median delay for symptoms of 2\u20137 days for all RVs [33]. We used previous RV tests done before HAP diagnosis when available to try to overcome this issue. Finally, our study design prevented assessment of the pathogenic role of RVs. However, the fact that all RVs were obtained from BAL fluid or ETA argues in favor of their active role.",

The latter seems to be associated with poorer outcomes compared with bacteria only or virus only pneumonia. RVs found in HAP could be divided in two categories: (i) community-acquired viruses with chronic shedding (i.e. mainly rhinovirus) in immunocompromised patients, associated with other microorganisms at the time of HAP, and (ii) hospital-acquired viruses (RSV, parainfluenza, influenza and human metapneumovirus) in debilitated patients with prolonged hospitalization.
