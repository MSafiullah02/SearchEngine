The mean >4.4 log reduction in the MERS\u2010CoV titer exceeded the European Committee of Blood Transfusion recommendations stating that, to be considered effective, a pathogen\u2010reduction process should reduce screened pathogens by at least 3 logs.17 A study conducted by Corman and colleagues indicated that MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients may have viral loads up to 5 or 6 log RNA copies/mL in their serum.18 However, those authors also indicated that this virus did not appear to be infectious in cell culture,18 suggesting that transfusion transmission is unlikely.",

However, although it is rare, transfusion transmission of even well\u2010known pathogens like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) still occurs in the United States.20 In resource\u2010limited setting like Africa, as many as 10% to 15% of new HIV cases can be linked to transfusion\u2010transmitted infections.21 Targeted screening programs are limited in part by the incremental nature of updating the pathogen list and by our knowledge of each pathogen. A recent estimate is that, of the 1407 known human pathogens, 58% are zoonotic, and 13% are considered emerging or re\u2010emerging pathogens.22 Known pathogens are not the only concern for blood safety: one estimate is that 5.3 novel viruses are discovered each year and that from 60% to 70% of these viruses have animal origins.1 Targeted screening on this scale is not economically or logistically feasible and cannot keep pace with the emerging threats to blood safety. Pathogen\u2010reduction systems have the potential to be a complementary approach to blood screening programs and may have the potential to replace some screening assays, like cytomegalovirus and West Nile virus. Riboflavin and UV light already have established efficacy against a broad array of viral pathogens (14 different viruses), including influenza A, HIV, and West Nile virus.9, 12 The results from the current study support the finding that riboflavin and UV light effectively inactivate coronaviruses in addition to the broad spectrum of other enveloped and nonenveloped viruses already tested.",
