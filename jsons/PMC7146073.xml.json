SARS-COV-2 cases were unevenly distributed within the Regions ranging from 0 to maximum of 25 cases per Nephrology Unit. The difference in number of cases among the Units may reflect a true variability in the incidence of positive cases in Piedmont and Aosta Valley.

However, we felt that they could add to the current scant knowledge since they come from the first regional inquiry in RRT patients and may help better understanding of the epidemic. Furthermore, these data confirm that RRT patients and hospital staff have a higher incidence of infection and show that RRT patients have higher lethality than the general population. This observation may support maximizing preventive measures and early diagnosis in this fragile population.",
