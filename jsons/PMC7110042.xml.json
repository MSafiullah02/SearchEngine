Although human coronaviruses cause up to 30% of colds, they rarely cause a lower respiratory tract disease, and never have a devastating effect as seen with the SARS-CoV.5 In contrast, animal coronaviruses are known to cause devastating epizootics of respiratory or enteric diseases in livestock and poultry.5 In fact, coronaviruses have been isolated from avian, porcine, feline, murine, bovine and canine species.5 All known coronaviruses are categorized in three serologically well-defined and unrelated groups. The SARS coronavirus is clearly new to the human population and its RNA genome differs substantially from sequences of all known coronaviruses.6,7 The natural host of the SARS-CoV is most likely a Civet cat, whose virus had acquired the ability to infect humans. Interestingly, SARS-CoV can be readily isolated and grown in monkey kidney Vero cell cultures.8",

However, although vaccination with live, attenuated virus is effective against porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus and avian infectious bronchitis virus, recombination of the genome of vaccine strains with wild-type coronavirus is a potential risk when applied in humans.5 Moreover, some vaccines against feline coronaviruses have been proven to enhance disease when vaccinated animals were exposed to wild-type virus, and thus antibody enhancement of disease is a potential risk of SARS-CoV vaccines in humans.5 Therefore, it is prudent to develop safe and effective drugs against SARS-CoV as quickly as possible in case a novel wide-spread outbreak would occur. The development of effective drugs against SARS-CoV may also provide new strategies for the prevention or treatment of other coronavirus diseases in animals or humans. Indeed, there are no approved drugs with proven efficacy against coronaviruses. Ribavirin has been given to SARS patients but its efficacy is unclear. Several other compounds have been recently mentioned as potential drug leads against SARS-CoV.9\u201315",

The virus\u2013drug mixture was not removed after the adsorption phase of the virus infection. The compounds were present throughout the whole time period of the experiment. Three days (SARS-CoV) or four days (Fe-CoV) after the infection, the number of viable cells was quantified by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method as previously described for HIV by Pauwels et al.21 The medium was aspirated and replaced by a solution of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazonium]/PMS (phenazinemethosulphate) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The results are given as the mean (\u00b1SD) of at least 2\u20133 independent experiments. The cytotoxic concentration was determined as the concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability by 50% (CC50 or 50% cytotoxic concentration), and the antivirally effective concentration was determined as the compound concentration that prevented the viral cytopathic effect by 50% of the control value (EC50 or 50% effective concentration). Thus, both the CC50 and the EC50 values were calculated from the absorbance values, and the EC50s were obtained after deduction of the absorbance value of the control cultures from the absorbance value of the virus-infected cultures.",

The anti-coronavirus activities ranged between 0.29 and >100 mg/L for FIPV and between 4.2 and >100 mg/L for SARS-CoV depending on the nature and the locations of the substituents in the phenyl moiety. As a rule, when antiviral activity was recorded, the anti-FIPV activity was always more pronounced than the anti-SARS-CoV activity. Compounds that were weakly inhibitory against FIPV did not show detectable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. Generally, sulphide and sulphoxide derivatives showed poor, if any, antiviral activity against both coronaviruses except for 27 and 35 that were inhibitory to Fe-CoV (EC50: <10 mg/L), but not to SARS-CoV (EC50: >100 mg/L). The position of one or more alkyl or alkoxy groups on the phenyl moiety does not play a marked role in the eventual anti-coronavirus potency of the test compounds (compare compounds 4\u201335). This was generally also observed for the halogen-, nitro- and cyano-substituted compounds. The most potent antiviral activity was noted for the trichloro (44), pentachloro (45), methyl/tetrachloro (46) and nitro (52) derivatives (EC50: 0.3\u20130.9 mg/L for Fe-CoV and \u223c17\u201320 mg/L for SARS-CoV) virtually completely lacking cytotoxic activity against the CRFK and Vero cell cultures (MIC: \u2265100 mg/L).

However, it should be noticed that these compounds proved markedly cytotoxic to both CRFK and Vero cell cultures, and therefore potential anti-FIPV activity may have been masked by the cellular toxicity or, alternatively, the observed anti-SARS-CoV activity has to be interpreted as a toxic rather than a specific antiviral effect. For all other antivirally active compounds\u2014as already noted for the unsubstituted series of compounds discussed above\u2014anti-FIPV activity was more pronounced than the anti-SARS-CoV activity. Compound 72 represents the only exception where anti-SARS-CoV activity was noticed (EC50: 13 mg/L) without a trace of anti-FIPV activity.

This compound was not cytotoxic at 100 mg/L, and therefore represents the most selective anti-FIPV compound among all pyridine N-oxide derivatives tested. The location of the chloro substituent on the pyridine moiety seems crucial, since moving the chloro from Y1 to the Y2, Y3 or Y4 position resulted in completely inactive compounds (158, 161, 165). Besides 155, also 132, 133, 142 and 146 can be regarded as highly selective anti-Fe-CoV compounds. As observed before, none of the compounds was more inhibitory against SARS-CoV than against Fe-CoV. Compounds 157 and 159 were the most interesting compounds that had comparable (potent) activity against both SARS-CoV and FIPV (EC50: 1.7\u20134.2 mg/L), being poorly cytotoxic (157; CC50: 62 mg/L for CRFK and >100 mg/L for Vero cell cultures) to moderately cytotoxic (159; CC50: 13 mg/L for CRFK and 71 mg/L for Vero cell cultures) (Table 4). \n",

Such an antiviral selectivity spectrum is rather unusual. Interestingly, as previously noted between HIV-1, HIV-2 and HCMV, there is no close correlation for the antiviral activity of the pyridine N-oxides against HIV-1 on the one hand, and FIPV and SARS-CoV on the other hand (r = 0.29 and 0.47, respectively) (compare the antiviral activities of the test compounds against HIV-1 with those found against the coronaviruses given in Tables 1\u20135). Also, there is no correlation for the EC50s between FIPV and SARS-CoV in cell culture (r = 0.06). Indeed, there were a number of compounds that proved exclusively inhibitory to FIPV and not to SARS-CoV. Among these, only 63 and 116 were not active against HIV-1.

It has previously been shown that pyridine N-oxide derivatives such as 11, 17, 45 and 160 act at a step in the HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication cycle that follows proviral integration, i.e. at the HIV gene expression level.18 In this respect, the pyridine N-oxide derivatives inhibit binding of nuclear NF-\u03baB to DNA in the intact cell system and regeneration of I\u03baB\u03b1 after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation.18,19 Thus, targeting of a cellular protein in the transactivation process is the most likely explanation for the anti-HIV/HCMV activity of the pyridine N-oxide derivatives. The molecular target for the anti-coronavirus activity is still unclear. Coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm, and not in the nucleus. However, a TOA experiment in which the pyridine N-oxide derivative 45 was added at different time points after Fe-CoV infection of CRFK cell cultures revealed that addition of the compound to the virus-infected cells could be substantially delayed before losing its antiviral potential (Figure 2). A similar TOA experiment against HIV in human lymphocyte CEM cell cultures revealed also a post-integrational event as a target of 45 in the replication cycle of HIV.18 Thus, compound 45 inhibits virus replication at an event that is clearly located after viral entry and acts most likely during the transcription process of the virus replication cycle. However, not only the differences in antiviral activity but also cytotoxicity depending on the virus type (HIV, Fe-CoV, SARS-CoV) or cell type (CEM, CRFK, Vero) is indicative for a rather specific interaction with a cellular and/or a viral factor to explain the rather unpredictable antiviral and cytostatic properties of the pyridine N-oxide derivatives. In this respect, while the oxide form of the compounds seems to be crucial to maintain anti-coronavirus activity, this requirement was much less stringent to keep anti-HIV-1 activity (compare anti-HIV and anti-coronavirus activity for the reduced pyridine N-oxides in Table 5). \n",

Under these experimental conditions, 45 did not result in any visible signs of toxicity or side effects in the drug-exposed animals.
