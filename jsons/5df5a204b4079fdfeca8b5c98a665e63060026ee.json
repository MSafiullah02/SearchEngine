Previously existing price differences between regional offerings no longer play a significant role today, since most large IaaS customers use cloud enterprise agreements that calculate costs based on the use of a service regardless of location of the service provided. 161 For smaller customers, the regional offerings are, however, still more expensive, as the cost to maintain a server center in the EU is higher. The price difference between North Virginia and Ireland is around 5-10% for small amounts of usage. 162 If the data is being processed on the US West Coast, then the price is even higher than in Ireland.

A conservative prediction by Gartner, highlights that the number of networked devices in use worldwide will reach 20.8 billion by 2020. 284 s estimates are around 50 billion IoT connections by 2020. 285 Huawei projects that such connections will hit the 100 billion figure by 2025. 280 resources that an attacker can use to attack the system (see Manadhata While the exact numbers are uncertain, the overall picture is clearly one of significant growth. 286 The direct result is that there will be a massive amount of Internet-enabled devices operating dynamically that will require a sufficient protection. Due to the fast development of the IoT that occurred without appropriate consideration for security issues, smart devices are inherently insecure. 287 A 2015 study by Hewlett Packard showed that 70 percent of IoT devices contain serious vulnerabilities. 288 These vulnerabilities stem in particular from the following: 289 -tasktional processing power adds cost). 290 This means that most devices will not support the processing power required for strong security measures and secure communication, such as encryption (e.g. an 8-bit microcontroller, the function of which is merely to switch lights on and off, cannot support the industry standard SSL to encrypt communications 291 ) and may transmit data in clear text. 292 This is, of course, particularly problematic in the IoT context, given the massive amounts of data that are being transmitted between smart devices, the cloud and mobile applications. 293 Insufficient authentication and authorization: Authentication/authorization can be insufficient due to poor password requirements, use of, lack of periodic password resets and failure to require re-authentication for sensitive data. Weak authentication and authorization compromise the entire IoT system. 294 Insecure Web interface: Security issues with the web interface include persistent cross-site scripting, poor session management and weak or plain default credentials (which can be exploited by enumerating accounts until access is granted). 295 Insecure software and firmware: due to resource constraints, most IoT devices are designed without the ability to accommodate software or firmware updates (which would add cost). As a result, vulnerability patching is difficult. 296 This is problematic since -free software. 297 In addition, where updates are available, many devices do not appear to use encryption for software updates downloads. 298 Hence, the explosion in the number of connected devices, coupled wi is shifting the security paradigm from hardware to the networks that process the devices.
