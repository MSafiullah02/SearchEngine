We have previously shown that a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) fused with human Fc (S377-588-Fc) induced highly potent anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in the presence of MF59 adjuvant. Here we optimized the doses of S377-588-Fc using MF59 as an adjuvant in order to elicit strong immune responses with minimal amount of antigen. Our results showed that S377-588-Fc at 1 mg was able to induce in the immunized mice potent humoral and cellular immune responses. Particularly, S377-588-Fc at 1 mg elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV similar to those induced at 5 and 20 mg, respectively. These results suggest that this RBD-based subunit MERS vaccine candidate at the dose as low as one mg is sufficiently potent to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, against MERS-CoV infection, thus providing guidance for determining the optimal dosage of RBD-based MERS vaccines in the future clinical trials and for applying the dosesparing strategy in other subunit vaccine trials.",

[14] [15] [16] To accomplish this, MERS-CoV depends on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit to bind host cellular receptors. [17] [18] [19] As such, RBD is an important target for the development of MERS vaccines. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Previous studies have mapped the RBD to the regions containing residues 358-588, 367-588, 377-588, and 367-606 of MERS-CoV S protein. [17] [18] [19] 22, 23, 25 It is known that a fragment containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV RBD is a critical neutralizing domain. [22] [23] 26 After comparing 5 different RBD fragments respectively containing residues 350-588, 358-588, 367-588, 367-606, and 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein fused with Fc of human IgG, namely S350-588-Fc, S358-588-Fc, S367-588-Fc, S367-606-Fc, S377-588-Fc, we found that S377-588-Fc induced the highest antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals. 22 promotion of immunogenicity of the aforementioned S377-588-Fc, and demonstrated that MF59 is an ideal adjuvant for use with this protein. 27 However, the minimal dose of the RBD protein required to induce sufficient immune responses against MERS-CoV infection remains to be elucidated. This calls for further optimization of the antigen dose for MERS subunit vaccines.",

            "text": "Among various vaccine types, such as those based on inactivated and live-attenuated viruses and viral vectors, recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines are considered to be the safest type of vaccines against virus infection. 20, 26, 32 However, the efficacy of subunit vaccines largely depends on the identification of suitable antigens and selection of appropriate adjuvants. 20, 32 We have shown that a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV RBD elicited the highest neutralizing antibodies among the 5 RBD fragments tested against MERS-CoV infection. 22, 23, 27 In addition, we have demonstrated that MF59 is most potent among the 5 adjuvants, including Freund's, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, MF59, and Montanide ISA51, to augment the immunogenicity of S377-588-Fc to induce strong antibody responses, neutralizing antibodies, and protection against MERS-CoV infection, suggesting it an ideal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines. 27 Apart from antigens and adjuvants, an equally crucial, but often neglected, aspect of immunization is the optimization of antigen dosage to find the minimal antigen dose able to induce strong immune responses. 33, 34 In this study, we compared the levels of immune responses in mice immunized with S377-588-Fc at 1, 5, and 20 mg, respectively, formulated with MF59 adjuvant. This range of doses was selected based on our previous studies showing that 10 mg of this protein induced strong immune responses with neutralizing activity that protected all of the vaccinated mice from challenge of MERS-CoV. 22, 23 Here, we found that S377-588-Fc at 1 mg was able to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses in the immunized mice. Particularly, this protein at 1 mg induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against infections of both MERS pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV, similar to those induced at 5 and 20 mg, respectively, suggesting that 1 mg of S377-588-Fc formulated with MF59 is sufficient to induce strong neutralizing antibody response capable of protecting mice from MERS-CoV challenge, as that was induced by 10 mg of S377-588-Fc formulated with MF59 in our previous study. 27 Therefore, only about 10% of S377-588-Fc that we tested before is actually needed to achieve the efficacy for prevention of MERS-CoV infection in vaccinated mice, based on the results from the present study.",

The cells were stained with conjugated anti-mouse-CD4 (APC) and -CD8 (P-Cy5-5) antibodies for 30 min at 4 C. After washes, the cells were fixed using the Cytofix/Cytoperm TM Kit (BD Biosciences) and stained with anti-mouse-IL-2 (FITC) and -IFN-g (PE) (BD Biosciences) antibodies for 30 min at 4 C. The stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva software v.6.1.2 (BD Biosciences).",
