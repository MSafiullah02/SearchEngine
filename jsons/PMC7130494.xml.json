It is acknowledged that personal factors, health care systems and cultures may have an impact upon the willingness of nurses to work with HIV-positive people (Ives et al., 2009). While general societal attitudes towards PLHIV may be less favourable, these negative attitudes may also be seen among health care personnel (Tyer-Viola, 2007). In Lithuania, the AIDS Centre conducted an anonymous survey in 1990 to clarify the attitude of medical staff towards those living with HIV. The results showed that up to 90% of the medical staff were not willing to care for patients with HIV. Although the situation changed over the years (from 1990 to 1999) and the proportion of staff unwilling to care for patients with HIV was reduced to 52.9%, doctors and nurses, in particular those not working in major cities, still feel a certain fear and tend to separate people living with HIV (Lithuanian country report, 2007). For example, 78% of Lithuanian health care workers would not allow their child to a kindergarten group, which is visited by a HIV-positive child (Lithuania National AIDS Program Evaluation, 2005). These examples show that broad-scale education and extensive information to reduce these barriers are still required.",

Different background factors have been found to have an impact on whether nurses are willing to provide care or not: cultural values (Oyeyemi et al., 2006), age (V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki et al., 2008), gender (Oyeyemi et al., 2008, Cai et al., 2007), whether nurses have met (Tyer-Viola, 2007), taken care of (Oyeyemi et al., 2008, Pisal et al., 2007, Williams et al., 2006, Peate et al., 2002) PLHIV or worked with colleagues with HIV (Kiragu et al., 2004). The number of working years has been shown to be negatively associated with willingness to treat PLHIV (e.g. Worthington et al., 2008). Furthermore, nurses' willingness to take care of PLHIV has been found to be related to whether the HIV-positive people were homosexuals, intravenous drug users or prostitutes (Tyer-Viola, 2007).",

(2000), for example, reported after seven training workshop sessions during a five-month period a positive impact on nurses' willingness to take care of PLHIV. Buskin et al. (2002) found after two lectures that additional education could help eliminate a substantial amount of unwillingness to be in proximity of a person with HIV. It is not clear, however, what educational methods would be best to make an impact. In most intervention studies educational programmes have included workshops (Williams et al., 2006, Ezedinachi et al., 2002, Slaten et al., 2000) or lectures (Buskin et al., 2002). It has been assumed that the educational programmes related to HIV should consist of various different teaching methods to allow debating and discussion about willingness to take care of PLHIV (Wu et al., 2002, Uwakwe, 2000). Models of education that show most promise are those that use experiential styles of learning. It has been shown that it is possible to increase nurses' empathic ability (e.g. Brunero et al., 2010). Furthermore, Uwakwe (2000) found that an indicator of the degree of success of the programme is the increased willingness of the participating nurses subsequently to work with and treat PLHIV.",

HIV-related stigma is reduced if PLHIV are not seen as \u201cdifferent\u201d. However, when using just one general background question on whether nurses were willing to take care of PLHIV, up to 93% of the control group nurses reported unwillingness to care for PLHIV. Keeping in mind that drug use is the main route of transmission in Lithuania, this may be a potential cause of the lack of willingness to provide care. Drug use generally is a stigmatised activity, which is why people may be unwilling to care for drug users.",

This might have been influenced by the attitude towards continuing studies of nurses. However, having reviewed the plans of the institutions providing services in Lithuania, it was noted that the training in this area is the thing that nurses miss most. It is therefore important to focus on improving nurse education, and basic educational support should be a priority for those working with PLHIV. A more organized educational structure, targeted at all health care professionals in the form of health talks/seminars, in-service training, continuing medical education and nursing curricula, would improve the knowledge level related to HIV for health care providers most efficiently and effectively. Consequently, educational programmes based on research evidence must play a leading role in educational strategies to help nurses understand HIV-positive people and change their attitudes towards taking care of them. In the future, we need more outcome research and intervention studies to assess their effects systematically as stated by Hallberg (2006).",
