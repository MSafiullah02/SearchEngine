At the background of such cultivation stands the absence of positing a mind-body duality and a lack of concern with a particular physical location of the mind in early Buddhist thought. Moreover, the various exercises that involve directing mindfulness to the body need to be considered in conjunction in order to arrive at a balanced understanding of their overarching purpose. Out of the different possible modalities of cultivating mindfulness in this way, the discourses present awareness directed to one's own bodily postures as a practice already undertaken by the Buddha-to-be when he was still in quest of awakening. In this particular setting, such mindfulness of postures served as a way of facing fear. The potential of this exercise to provide a grounding in embodied mindfulness, being fully in the here and now, is of particular relevance to the challenges posed by the current pandemic.",

Early Buddhist thought stands out in its historical setting for an emphasis on the mind and intentionality. This can be seen, for example, in a debate with a follower of the Jain tradition, reported in the Up\u0101li-sutta (MN 56 and M\u0100 133). Regarding the relative importance of bodily, verbal, and mental activities in relation to unwholesome and reprehensible deeds, according to this discourse, the representative of the Jain tradition took the position that bodily activities are the most important of these three. This might at first sight seem obvious, simply because bodily activities can inflict greater harm and hence need above all to be restrained. Yet, the Buddha disagreed, instead according chief importance to mental activities. The position taken in this way reflects the overarching concern with intentionality in early Buddhist ethics. Viewed from this perspective, bodily infliction of harm is ultimately due to harmful mental intentions that lead to reprehensible physical acts.",

When questioned by the Buddha about cultivation of the mind, however, it turned out that the debater had no clear idea of what this could imply. This neatly reflects the importance attached in the ancient Indian setting to the practice of asceticism for progress to liberation, combined with a lack of awareness of an alternative approach that rather places the focus on cultivating the mind.",

These five had been the companions of the Buddha-to-be during his own practice of asceticism. Once he realized that ascetic practice was not conducive to liberation and abandoned it, these five left him in the belief that he had forsaken the path to awakening. According to the Ariyapariyesan\u0101-sutta and its parallel, the Buddha did not find it easy to persuade these five that abandoning ascetic practice could actually be part of a path to awakening, rather than automatically implying a reversion to a life of sensual indulgence.

In fact, the same discourse collection that houses the Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na-sutta also has an entire discourse dedicated to this topic, which is the Discourse on Mindfulness of the Body (MN 119 and M\u0100 81). The exercises common to the two parallel versions of this discourse cover the following Considering these different practices in conjunction relates to the earlier-mentioned need to evaluate individual exercises for contemplating the body within their context. This can be helpful to counter the impression of some scholars that the Buddhist attitude toward the body is a predominantly negative one. For example, according to Kajiyama (1972, p. 257) , in the Buddhist tradition \"the body is regarded as the origin of disgust, pain and evil, and emancipation from the body is the ideal.\" Or else Faure (1998, p. 32) proposed that \"Buddhist deprecations of the body, a fortiori the female body, aim at provoking a holy horror of sensual desire.\"",

This description, given in similar ways in the two parallel versions, points to mindfulness of bodily postures, even though mindfulness is not explicitly mentioned. The potential to face fear in this way would be related to the type of grounding in the here and now that such deployment of mindfulness can provide. Being seated alone in a forest and hearing an unexpected sound, the tendency to react immediately is in a way natural. Yet, acting out that impulse is a way of succumbing to the fear and reacting to it, rather than facing anxiety calmly for what it is. Of course, fear can at times have an important function. But the type of noise described in the discourse does not give the impression that there was an urgent need for the Buddha-to-be to protect himself.
