It has been estimated that viruses that target sea-dwelling organisms, such as algae, turn over half of the world's biomass each day. As such, viruses are an important part of the ecological balance on earth. Of the vast collection of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses, research has focused on the tiny fraction that cause disease in humans, domestic animals, and crops. Modern virology, coupled with public health initiatives, has seen many triumphs including the development of effective vaccines against yellow fever, poliomyelitis, smallpox, mumps, measles, rubella, hepatitis A and B, and papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer. The global eradication of smallpox and poliovirus as well as the prediction and successful prophylactic vaccination against influenza represent tremendous gains for public health. Antiviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and some herpesviruses, as well as rapid detection and containment of emerging viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) illustrate the successful application of viral research programs as well as the need for ongoing efforts focused on rapid identification and elucidation of viral distribution, kinetics, and pathogenesis. With the growth of knowledge about replication, transmission, and disease, viruses have also taken the stage as possible biowarfare, bioterrorist, and criminal agents.",

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce basic concepts in virology and to provide several examples of how current technology has been used to identify and track viral pathogens. The first part of the chapter discusses virus structure, replication strategies, classification, and evolution. The second part highlights the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification. We follow this with examples of how emerging viruses were identified and tracked (Sin Nombre, Nipah, West Nile, SARS coronavirus, and monkeypox). With regard to viral forensics, the Schmidt case is a fascinating example illustrating how the study of RNA virus evolution and relatedness was used in a criminal investigation. Finally, we provide a few snapshot views into new technologies that allow the creation of manmade or \u201cengineered\u201d viruses, some exciting new frontiers in viral diagnostics, and a few thoughts on the future of virology.",

Virus particles are either enveloped or nonenveloped. Enveloped viruses contain one or more envelope glycoproteins embedded in a lipid bilayer that is acquired by budding through host cell membranes. Nonenveloped viruses are made up of a tight protein shell. In both kinds of viral particles, the envelope or protein shell serves to protect the viral genome from the hazardous extracellular environment, since without such protection, the fragile nucleic acid genome would be vulnerable to physical, chemical, and/or enzymatic destruction. Surface proteins also harbor functions required for virus entry into host cells. Inside the virus particle, the viral genome is associated with one or more proteins to form a complex usually referred to as the nucleocapsid. In addition to nucleic acid binding proteins, some viruses also carry enzymes required to initiate replication (like polymerases). Although not all virus particles are highly structured, two kinds of symmetry are common. Helical symmetry is reflected by the arrangement of the protein subunits in a \u201cspring-like\u201d or stacked lock-washer fashion, whereas icosahedral symmetry comprises 20 triangular faces that form the surface of a sphere. In the simplest icosahedral capsid, one protein subunit is at each triangular point of the 20 faces, requiring 60 total subunits.",

The surface of an enveloped virus particle contains virus-specific proteins that mediate viral recognition of host cell targets. The membrane surface of a host cell is riddled with numerous macromolecules including glycoproteins, glycolipids, and carbohydrate residues that have specific host functions serving as transport channels, mediating signaling pathways, and assisting in antigen presentation. While these macromolecules may be essential for host cell survival and function, some of these macromolecules also serve as receptors for virus particles. The presence of the host cell receptor is essential for viral attachment, but the mere presence of the receptor does not confer upon the cell the ability to support virus replication. Some viruses (such as HIV) require a coreceptor for viral entry without which the virus may be able to bind to the host cell membrane but remain unable to enter the cell. If the virus is not enveloped or is a naked particle, the viral capsid undergoes a conformational change upon binding that releases energy used to breach the host membrane, allowing viral entry. Delivery of viral nucleocapsid, and hence the genome RNA or DNA, occurs via fusion of the virus particle with cellular membrane either at the cell surface or after endocytosis. Virus genome replication can occur either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, and all viruses usurp the host cell translational machinery to produce virus-specific proteins.",

Besides the annual flu season, severe pandemics have occurred such as the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu of 1957, the Hong Kong flu of 1968, and the Russian flu of 1977.8 Influenza virus infects several animal hosts, including humans, pigs, horses, and its natural reservoir, waterfowl. The two major antigenic proteins of this virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NP), can be reassorted between different influenza viruses, generating new strains different from the two parental strains (called antigenic shift). Each influenza strain is given a code which identifies its HA and NP proteins.

Initial symptoms may be slight, such as a rash or fever, and may not initially prompt patients to seek medical care. Diagnostic samples are taken when people seek medical treatment; therefore, the presence of virus and virus-specific antibodies depends on the incubation period. This observation has important implications for the identification of new viral infections or epidemics. Virus may be detected and isolated for infections with short incubations; however, antibodies may not yet have developed, see Figure 4.2\n. For example, infections with influenza and adenovirus have very short incubation periods, 1\u20132 days, before myalgias and fever manifest. Many viruses have invaded the body for over a week before symptoms become apparent. Dengue, measles, and rotavirus are relatively asymptomatic during the first 5\u20138 days, but may rapidly progress to severe illness soon after. Longer incubation\nperiods may be caused by chronic infections. For example, rabies virus may remain silent for 30\u2013100 days after an animal bite before causing sudden disease demanding medical treatment. Other stealth viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and papilloma viruses, may bring about a mild ailment initially that may gradually progress to a fatal disease. Patients with chronic infections may seroconvert and have detectable virus even in the presence of antibodies. Others may be persistently infected by a virus, yet never develop symptoms. These carriers may have low levels of virus, which could potentially be transmitted to other individuals despite being below the level of assay detection. An understanding of how the host responds to viral infection aids investigators and health care workers in identifying and treating infection.",

Effector T cells specific for virus antigen stimulate B cells to secrete virus-specific antibodies. There are two predominate types of antibodies produced in response to virus infection, IgM and IgG. The first antibody produced is the IgM isotype and is present in the blood within days and remains in circulation for several months. As the adaptive response develops, B cells switch antibody isotypes to secrete the IgG form. Investigators use the detection of antibodies as indicators of virus exposure, and can utilize knowledge of the presence of specific isotypes to discern acute infection from past or chronic infection. Detection of IgM or rising titers of IgG points to a recent virus exposure. Virus-specific antibodies are also used as tools in numerous serological assays.

Other viruses are capable of establishing a long-term, persistent infection and may be present for years or throughout the life of the host. During a persistent infection, some viruses are continuously present in the body with a constant level of viremia, or virus detectable in the blood. For example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is noncytopathic even while actively replicating. Other viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus regulate their replication programs to avoid detection by the immune system, while still others establish infection in certain areas of the body that are immunoprivileged sites, including the central nervous system (CNS) and the eye, where once present, viruses may propagate undetected. Viruses may evade the immune response by infecting the immune cells themselves, such as in HIV infection of CD4+ T cells and dengue virus infection of dendritic cells. Some viruses enter a latent stage where replication temporarily ceases. Reactivation of virus replication can occur weeks to years later, multiple times in the life of the host. Finally, viruses may reduce the rate of virus production so that little or no virus is detectable. As the immune system struggles to control, but not eliminate the infection, virus may be measured in a cyclical pattern with titers alternately rising above and falling below the threshold of detection.",

The virus may have been cleared from the area of disease, or the symptoms may reflect damage induced by the immune system rather than direct virus pathology. It is therefore critical to obtain samples early in the infection and from multiple locations in the body. The most common site to look for virus is in the blood. Other clinical samples are generally collected near the site of virus-induced disease or based on known routes of virus transmission. Mosquitoes can deposit West Nile virus and dengue into the skin; poxvirus and papillomavirus replication can create lesions and warts; the perfuse spread of Ebola allows detection even in the skin. For respiratory infections, samples may include nasal and throat swabs as well as nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchial lavage fluids. Urine and stool samples are collected for enteric disease, and cerebral spinal fluid is obtained when neurological symptoms are present. Viruses may be very labile, and care must be taken to avoid exposure to harsh treatments such as extreme pH, direct sunlight, and freezing temperatures in order to preserve the potential for identification and study.

For instance, viruses from the conjunctiva, nasal and respiratory tracts are incubated at cooler temperatures resembling the exterior of the body, and viruses entering cells via fusion proteins requiring cleavage need to have trypsin added to the culture media. Some viruses cannot be cultivated in cell lines but require that clinical samples be injected into suckling mice by specially trained personnel and examined for virus using serological methods.

            "text": "An immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads. Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identifying the virus through sequence analysis, a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic tree, since viruses that share a mode of transmission often cluster together. More than one type of vector may be used within the same family of viruses, but individual members depend on a particular vector. Viruses from the family Bunyaviridae can be transmitted to humans by such pests as ticks, mosquitoes, flies, and rodents. The particular vector utilized often distinguishes individual subgroups within the family. Phylogenetic trees have been instrumental in proving virus transmission through family members, hospital settings, and susceptible members of a population. By comparing the virus sequence isolated from a patient to virus sequences isolated from individuals in the population transmission routes can be deduced. For example, it can be concluded that a doctor became infected from a patient seen at a hospital rather than from the general community if the virus sequences from doctor and patient are more similar than sequences found in the population.",

Viruses isolated from reservoirs in different geographic locations can define where people became infected. Arenaviruses are carried by rodents, but domestic rodents are often responsible for causing infections rather than rodents found in the fields or forests. By analyzing virus sequences obtained from infected patients and from house, field, and forest mice, the group of mice serving as a reservoir can be determined, and public health measures to prevent rodents from entering homes can be implemented. The origin of a virus outbreak can involve larger geographic areas. As the SARS outbreak demonstrates, importation of new viruses is an increasing global health concern. By accessing a database of virus genomes from around the world, a new virus outbreak could be rapidly identified as having been imported from another land. As viruses travel, some viruses become endemic, and it is necessary to distinguish between endemic and imported outbreaks to allow appropriate control measures to function. Viruses may also cause seasonal outbreaks. Influenza varies its genome with each year of infection. By understanding the extent to which the virus alters its genome from year to year, phylogenetic analysis assists in predicting the next year's strain and allows scientists to begin production for the upcoming yearly vaccine.",

            "text": "In May 1993, a clinician reported a cluster of cases presenting with nonspecific illness, fever, headache, and cough that rapidly progressed to respiratory distress. The patients were young, previously healthy, and lived in rural areas in the four-corners region bordering Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. By early June 1993, 24 cases had been reported with a mortality rate approximately 75%.11,\n12 Patient blood and autopsy tissues were sent to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for investigation. Diagnostic assays failed to identify known causes of respiratory illness; however, patient samples cross-reactived with antibodies to four different hantaviruses. Using hantavirus sera, immunohistochemistry detected hantavirus antigen in autopsy tissue from the lung and other involved organs.13 Hantaviruses are RNA viruses with a genome in three segments and a member of the family Bunyaviridae. Previous outbreaks of hantaviruses involved patients with renal disease leading to hemorrhagic complications, not respiratory distress. Hantaviruses are classified into four antigenic groups, and each strain of hantavirus is tightly associated with a specific rodent host. Although hantaviruses have a worldwide distribution, the dependence on a particular species of rodent host restricts the geographical range. Hantaan (HTN) is associated with the field mouse in Korea, China, and eastern Russia and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Seoul (SEO) causes moderate disease in Korea and China and is associated with urbanized rats. A milder form of HFRS is caused by the serogroup Puumula (PUU) in Scandinavia and Europe and is transmitted by the bank vole. At the time of the four-corners outbreak, the only North American hantavirus identified was Prospect Hill (PH), which was detected in two rodent isolates of meadow voles and not associated with any human illness. Patient samples from the U.S. four-corners region cross-reacted with hantavirus antigen and allowed epidemiologists to expand their assays to include RT-PCR and narrow the search for the host to local rodents. The virus was unable to be cultured from patient samples; therefore, molecular identification was crucial for identification. Partial sequences were available for HTN, SEO, PUU, and PH in a database and used to design PCR primers based on conserved areas of the virus glycoprotein. Nucleic acid was extracted from autopsy tissue, and a PCR product was detected in two cases using primer pairs based on PUU and PH. The PCR product was sequenced, revealing a 70% sequence similarity between the new virus and PH and PUU.14 New primers were designed and could detect products in all current cases. The sequence of the new virus was identified, and the nucleocapsid protein was expressed in bacteria and purified and used as a recombinant antigen in other serological assays.15 The new virus was eventually named Sin Nombre virus (SNV).",

            "text": "After the SNV outbreak, efforts increased to study the relationships between hantaviruses and the rodent hosts worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of rodent and human virus sequences has shown a close evolutionary relationship, and hantaviruses are often used as models of coevolution. A particular genotype of hantavirus persistently infects one species of rodent even though other rodent hosts may be present in the same environment. This remarkable coexistence has been mapped through changing landscapes. As a rodent species radiates farther away into another habitat, it may evolve into a separate, but genetically similar, species. The hitchhiker hantavirus also evolves with the rodent host, becoming genetically distinct from viruses associated with the ancestral species. This ancient relationship has been mapped using phylogenetic trees, which display common ancestral species as clusters that diverge and separate with geographical and genetic distance. The topology of the rodent tree can be compared and reveals similar patterns with topology of the associated hantaviruses.20 Phylogenies have been performed on rodent family, subfamily, genus, and species using mitochondrial DNA. Phylogenetic trees of hantaviruses reveal a similar branching pattern to the rodent tree. Viruses that infect the same subfamily of rodents form identical clades, and closely related hantaviruses are grouped in the same tree pattern as their rodent reservoirs. Although rare, there have been instances of transmission of one virus to another rodent species. This provides another example of molecular evolution where virus segments can mix in the host and form reassorted viruses containing combinations of different virus segments. This can contribute to genetic diversity. Reassortment of the segmented genome has been found in nature and in mixed virus infections in tissue culture, but only between very closely related viruses.21 Phylogenetic analysis performed on more than one virus segment tests for the chance of reassortment. Even in geographical locations where different rodent species may overlap, virus-host switching and reassortment are very rare events. Each hantavirus is associated with a primary rodent host, and usually a particular rodent species will be the primary reservoir of a single hantavirus. The tight correlation of virus and rodent host in the phylogenetic trees supports the concept of coevolution between virus and host. All subfamilies of the family Muridae have a hantavirus-rodent relationship. Fossil records estimate the rodent families Muridae to have split into the current subfamilies during the Miocene period, indicating that hantaviruses have been associated with their rodent hosts for 30 million years, an association that began before the division of the rodent family.22 The coevolutionary relationship and worldwide distribution of hantavirus illustrates that the 1993 SNV outbreak was not due to the emergence of a new virus or virus with an increased virulence, but simply the detection of an ancient virus.",

The outbreak was associated with a respiratory illness of pigs, and the primary human cases were individuals who had close contact or occupational exposure to pigs.23 The initial report was released in late September 1998, attributing the cause of illness to mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JE). JE is endemic to the region and was believed to involve pigs as amplifiers of virus. Ministries of Health began mosquito control measures and vaccination campaigns to block JE infection.24 By February 1999, the outbreak continued to spread as pigs were moved from the western-central region in the state of Perak to three other farms located in the southern states of Selangor and Negri Sembilan, the largest pig-rearing areas in Southeast Asia. Pigs were also exported to two farms in Singapore and resulted in 11 cases and two deaths. Singapore suspended pig importation from Malaysia, and no more cases were reported. Epidemiological analysis discredited JE as the infectious agent of the outbreak, since communities located near the pig farms did not become infected and immunization and vector control programs were having no effect on the increase of cases. As the outbreak continued, new attempts were made to find the pathogen.25 In March 1999, a virus was isolated by inoculating CSF obtained from fatal cases into Vero cells. The presence of multinucleate syncytia in infected cell culture implicated a paramyxovirus. Thin-section EM detected filamentous nucleocapsids with the hallmark herringbone pattern and also captured virus budding from the plasma membrane, both characteristic of paramyxoviruses.26 The new virus was named Nipah. A fortuitous event in the identification of the virus was the observed cross-reactivity between sera against Nipah and the paramyxovirus, Hendra virus. No other paramyxovirus sera reacted with Nipah samples.25\n",

Viral lineages from the alleged source diverged prior to divergences among the victim's viruses.

These innate properties have been used as tools in virology for decades. Examples include cold-adapted and attenuated live vaccine strains of influenza, cross-species rotavirus reassortants as vaccine candidates, and the attenuated yellow fever virus 17D vaccine strain that was derived by serial passaging in cell culture. Over the last 30 years, the recombinant DNA revolution has changed virology forever. Besides its impact on our ability to study specific viral nucleic acids and proteins, recombinant DNA technology (and PCR) sped up our ability to determine complete viral genomic sequences and create specific viral variants. The ability of scientists to engineer novel viruses varies greatly. Small positive-strand RNA viruses of bacteria, plants, and animals provided some of the first examples where infectious virus was produced via recombinant DNA. More recently, it has also become possible to engineer the >29-kb RNA genome of coronaviruses and both monopartite and segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. Viruses in the family Reoviridae, with double-stranded RNA genomes, have proven more difficult. For herpesviruses, whose genomic DNA is infectious, the same technologies used for cloning large pieces of chromosomal DNA have been applied successfully to propagate overlapping fragments of entire herpesvirus genomes. For the poxviruses, whose genomic DNA is not infectious, recombinant viruses are generated within infected cells by homologous DNA recombination between a plasmid containing the engineered segment and an infecting parental virus.",

An example of this, which received a great deal of attention from the media and the scientific community, was recently published for an attenuated form of poliovirus.53 While the poliovirus case came as no surprise to virologists and molecular biologists, it did bring several issues to the forefront. If an infectious virus can be created by synthetic methods, can it ever really be eradicated? In light of potential bioterrorist or biowarfare agents, should there be a restriction on making the genome sequence available in public databases? Should research on these agents be banned, classified, or otherwise regulated? These and other questions will continue to be debated in the years to come.",

Viruses are usually highly adapted to a particular niche, and most mutations are deleterious. Propagation of pathogenic viruses in cell culture often leads to adaptation to that environment and attenuation in their animal host. Recombinants or chimeras between even closely related viruses are usually impaired relative to either parent. We do see examples, however, of viruses that are benign in one animal host but highly pathogenic in another species. This is often the case in epizootic emerging viruses. An extreme example of host species-specific pathogenesis is the myxoma poxvirus, which causes a benign cutaneous fibroma in wild rabbits of the Americas but a highly lethal disease in the European rabbit. This virus was used for biological control of feral European rabbits in Europe and Australia. In 2001, an Australian group published a paper describing the construction of recombinant mousepox virus expression interleukin-4 (IL-4) and its pathogenesis in mice.54 This study provides a striking and sobering example of an engineered virus with enhanced pathogenicity. IL-4 is a cytokine that regulates the immune response at various levels. The recombinant mousepox virus suppressed both innate and adaptive immune responses that normally control infection and was lethal for otherwise genetically resistant mice. Moreover, even animals that had been previously vaccinated and protected from virulent mousepox were susceptible to lethal infection by the mousepox-IL-4 recombinant virus. This study raises obvious concerns about the efficacy of current vaccination against modified versions of the smallpox virus.",

The ability to engineer viruses makes the situation even more complex. While there are numerous laboratory strains of different viruses for which we know the exact sequence, the sequence of an isolate does not prove that it originated from a particular source.
