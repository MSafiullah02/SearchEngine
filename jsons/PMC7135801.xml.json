Bame and colleagues6 describe the use of 2-1-1 data to monitor real-time location and timing of unmet disaster needs during and following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in Texas. These results will prove useful for disaster preparedness as well as in helping meet needs during natural disasters in the future. Paradis7 describes lessons revealed from 2-1-1 responses during the SARS epidemic and (later that same year) with the Great Northeastern Blackout in metropolitan Toronto. The stories that emerged from these responses have shaped existing policies and approaches to emergency preparedness and disaster response.",

This study provides evidence of public broadcasting's ability to increase the reach of information and referral services, but it also serves as a great example of the potential that 2-1-1 partnerships have to disseminate information on needed resources nationally and quickly, as local public broadcasting and 2-1-1 systems are found in many communities across the country. These exemplars of 2-1-1 partnerships show how research can influence the development and implementation of programs and policies to help mitigate the impact of future disasters. Results can be applied to improve planning and to better address the needs of certain subgroups who are vulnerable and less able to respond effectively to the negative impact of disasters.",

Follow-up care coordination was provided for 2625 children to facilitate completion of referrals for diagnostic evaluation, early childhood education, and other developmental needs. This project offered screenings as well as referral services, thereby facilitating access among a population of low-income children who may not have received this care otherwise.

Results from this randomized trial revealed that when referrals were supplemented by proven outreach services such as navigation, better outcomes were realized. Given the extensive reach locally and nationally of the 2-1-1 system, and the elevated risk profile of callers, even a modest response to these screening, referral, and/or intervention programs could have a meaningful impact on population health and health disparities.",

New strategies for promoting 2-1-1 to this population are warranted. Most articles in this supplement demonstrate that a major strength of the 2-1-1 research partnership is relatively easy, quick, and cost-effective access to population subgroups that are traditionally difficult to reach and often suffer the greatest health risks. These 2-1-1 articles are an example to other researchers who are intending to develop research partnerships that work toward eliminating health disparities among special subgroups.",

Although Shank provides an important first look at costs, future expansion of 2-1-1 will demand increasing accountability, including more analysis of costs, benefits, and return on investment associated with 2-1-1 programs and services. Eddens and colleagues13 tackle an important methodologic and pragmatic question about whether the implementation of a minimal intervention research study in a 2-1-1 call center has adverse effects on key call-related quality indicators. Results from this study suggest that crises causing spikes in call volume adversely affect 2-1-1 service quality indicators as well as accrual of research participants. Thus, as the complexity or duration of an intervention or research demand is extended, support to expand 2-1-1 staffing is likely required.",

To apply this approach in 2-1-1 systems across the country, standardization of service request categories will be necessary.

This paper is a timely review of how 2-1-1 may best fit into the changing policies and structural changes underway within the U.S. healthcare system. After a brief review of key features of the ACA, and acknowledging that its full implementation will depend (in part) on the results of upcoming elections, they thoughtfully review ways in which 2-1-1 might play a role in improving health and healthcare access for its callers. For example, they propose that the 2-1-1 system is best positioned to share information with callers about their eligibility for different types of health coverage and how to enroll in programs for which they are eligible (Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, and [new] healthcare exchanges); referring individuals to available health programs/services in the local community (health centers/clinics); and providing healthcare assistance to new immigrants who may benefit from additional navigation services. They conclude by acknowledging that 2-1-1 has an important role to play for Americans who are newly eligible for insurance gain coverage and access to medical services due to ACA; particularly in \u201cconnecting the uninsured to safety-net resources.\u201d",
