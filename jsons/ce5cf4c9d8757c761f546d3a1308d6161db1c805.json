The purpose of this paper is to discuss the fundamentals of EIT and demonstrate the principles of mechanical ventilation, lung recruitment, and EIT imaging on a comprehensive physiological model, which combines a model of respiratory mechanics, a model of the human lung absolute resistivity as a function of air content, and a 2-D finite-element mesh of the thorax to simulate EIT image reconstruction during mechanical ventilation. The overall model gives a good understanding of respiratory physiology and EIT monitoring techniques in mechanically ventilated patients. The model proposed here was able to reproduce consistent images of ventilation distribution in simulated acutely injured and collapsed lung conditions. A new advisory system architecture integrating a previously developed data-driven physiological model for continuous and noninvasive predictions of blood gas parameters with the regional lung function data/information generated from absolute EIT (aEIT) is proposed for monitoring and ventilator therapy management of critical care patients.",

MV aims to improve pulmonary gas exchange via an adequate tidal volume (V T ) delivered at a suitable ventilatory/respiratory rate (RR). Oxygenation is improved by either raising the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) or increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) that helps to prevent recruited lung units collapsing at end-expiration. Another strategy, which aids the opening of potentially collapsing airways, is to prolong the inspiratory time by increasing the ventilator's inspiration-to-expiration (I:R) ratio. CO 2 elimination is improved by increasing the minute volume either via an appropriate setting of V T or RR.",

            "text": "Although MV can be a lifesaving intervention for many intensive care (ICU) patients, it has been associated with potential complications known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [1] , [2] . The choice of appropriate ventilator mode and settings can improve the benefit-to-risk ratio of MV by providing adequate gas exchange while reducing the risk of VILI [3] , [4] . However, known bedside measures to guide the clinician in adjusting MV settings are limited in that they tend to give global information regarding the performance of the lungs. Arterial blood gas analysis and airway pressure-volume (PV) graphical waveforms have been the gold standard clinical practices for assessing the acid-base balance, lung function, and guiding the titration of MV in critically ill patients. These are combined with measurements derived from pressure, flow, and volume, which give information about the mechanical properties of the lungs and chest wall. However, these methods are only able to provide an indication on the overall lung function, and thus fail to provide full information about the regional lung behavior. To date, chest imaging has relied on bedside X-ray radiography and the gold standard computed tomography (CT), which provides comprehensive images of the morphologic structures of the lungs and shows ventilation distribution with high spatial resolution. However, during these procedures, the patient is exposed to a substantial dose of radiation, and in the case of CT, the patient needs to be transported to the radiology department, which is a high risk process in the unstable critically ill. Indeed, the risks may be so high that the investigation is not carried out at all. Even if possible, the practical considerations mean that CT is an occasional investigation usually only repeated every few days at most. It is costly and both time and labor intensive. The process will require waiting for the scanning time to be available and will usually take up an hour or two of medical, nursing, and technician time (potentially depleting staff resources on the ICU itself), as well as radiology staff time, portering involvement, and occupying transfer equipment and ventilators. The last point is particularly important, as changing from the ICU ventilator to a transport ventilator will result in a brief period of loss of PEEP, with the potential for lung derecruitment or more subtle changes in ventilator pressures or flows, which may be deleterious for the patient. Absolute electrical impedance tomography (aEIT) provides a cheap, potentially continuous form of monitoring the behavior of the lungs, which may reveal changes and trends in regional ventilation. For example, progressive loss of ventilation in one lung may lead to the early detection of an endotracheal tube that has slipped down either the right or left main bronchus, leading to obstruction and underventilation of the opposite lung, or may suggest the development of some other pathology in the deteriorating lung, such as a developing pleural effusion compressing the lung or worsening atelectasis due to a disease process such as a pneumonia. Long-term electrode application can be irritant for the skin (although not more than ECG monitoring, which is almost invariably in place). There are practical problems with maintaining good electrical contact and coping with the wires. However, practice and timely application when patients are being rolled as part of routine patient care can go a long way to reduce these problems.",

For the uniqueness of the solution to this problem, a variety of assumptions has to be made [14] . These equations can be solved either with analytical methods or via numerical techniques using finite-element or finitedifference techniques [15] , [16] . A systematic approach for solving the reconstruction problem is to solve the forward problem, which consists of finding a unique effect (voltages) resulting from a given cause (currents) via a mathematical or physical model (conductivity distribution). The process of recovering the conductivity distribution within the body from the applied currents and measured boundary potentials is known as the inverse problem in EIT. There are two approaches for solving the image reconstruction problem in EIT. Static reconstruction produces an image of the absolute conductivity distribution of the medium based on one set of measurements. Dynamic or difference imaging attempts to recover the change in resistivity based on measurements made at two different time periods.",

The model uses normally distributed TOP and TCP pressures with a specific mean and standard deviation (SD), which may be adjusted to reflect the heterogeneous characteristic of alveoli under different abnormal lung conditions such as ARDS [20] , [21] . Fig. 4 illustrates the mechanics of a single alveolus during inflation and deflation. During inflation (inspiration), when the applied pressure exceeds the TOP, the lung unit pops open and assumes a volume according to (3) . During deflation (expiration), the lung unit collapses and its volume becomes zero when the applied pressure falls below the TCP.

The Gauss-Newton iterative algorithm implemented in [12] was also used in this simulation study. The model is cycled through the assigned airway pressure, and at each pressure step, the calculated lung volume is used to set the new absolute conductivities of the left and right lungs on the thorax model of Fig. 5 . EIT data are then generated using adjacent drive patterns with an injected current of 5 mA. These measured EIT data are compared to those predicted from another FEM using the same drive and measurement patterns until some desired accuracy has been achieved. On convergence, the reconstructed image of the lung conductivity distribution is displayed. The image sequence is obtained by calculating conductivity changes from a reference state, which defines the basal conductivities for the lungs and the surrounding organs shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 10 shows the reconstructed EIT images at end-inspiration during tidal breathing for the simulated normal and ARDS lung models. Conductivity values were scaled between 0.2 (nonconductive) and 1.0 (conductive) to produce this image contrast between aerated (dark blue) and nonaerated lung regions (red). Fig. 11 shows the sequence of lung image slices (progressing from left to right and top to bottom) reconstructed from a simulated breath (expiration-inspiration-expiration) related to the moderate ARDS model with the ventilator PEEP and PIP set to 0 and 40 cmH 2 O, respectively. Red lung regions correspond to expiration at FRC and dark blue lung regions correspond to inspiration. This image contrast is the result of the simulated changes in the conductivity of the left and right lungs. Lung inflation has begun at slice number 4, confirming the results obtained with the static PV curves of Fig. 8 .",

There is also often a clinical debate as to the value of certain monitoring techniques in a practical situation, such as the value of pressure volume loops and how these can be interpreted. Inflexion points on pressure volume loops are an example of this. These occur when the pressure volume relationship changes, indicating either improved compliance because airways are held open with PEEP. Alternatively, a fall in the change in volume per unit pressure increase seen at higher pressures suggests worsening compliance as the lung becomes overinflated. However, these inflexion points may be very indistinct or may not be obvious at all. Some of these issues are indeed important when considering the potential of EIT because measures of pressure and volume provide information about the whole respiratory system; hence, information on regional changes may be lost in the data originating from both lungs. EIT has an advantage in that regional change can be analyzed and changes over time are easier and potentially safer to monitor than formal pressure volume loop assessment. Even when pressure volume loops are used in the development of EIT, and in order to help establish either normal values of resistivity at different levels of lung inflation, the ability to examine regional change adds another dimension to our ability to examine the lung.",

This is potentially valuable as current methods such as compliance assessment or changes in PaO 2 reflect on the whole lung and may be affected by changes in cardiac output as intrathoracic pressures increase during the recruitment process. Continuous measurement during normal ventilation will provide information on regional atelectasis or overinflation and dynamic changes such as regional air trapping. Indeed, it could be argued that these are the pressures that the lungs are continually exposed to and so are the most important guide to adjustment of ventilator pressures. In this context, absolute EIT is very important, so that comparisons can be made against normal values. It may be that in future studies, aEIT will demonstrate that above a certain level of overinflation, more severe lung volutrauma can be expected. The ability to look at regions of the lung in this context may be very important.",

The model is not intended to be a complete representation of the respiratory physiology of ventilated patients affected by ARDS. However, while relatively simple, it gives a good understanding of the processes of recruitment and derecruitment in ARDS-affected lungs, and illustrates how ventilator settings can be optimized with the aid of EIT monitoring techniques. The model was able to reproduce images of the ventilated lung under different ARDS conditions, which were consistent and presented a good agreement with the PV curve simulation results obtained for the same model of ARDS lungs.
