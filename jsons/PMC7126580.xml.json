Breathing, coughing, talking, and sneezing by an infected person can generate pathogen-carrying particles and can cause the transmission of infectious diseases [2], [3]. Furthermore, infectious disease transmission in commercial aircraft cabins where passengers are in close proximity has become a major health issue [4]. Exhaled pathogen-containing particles generated by an infected passenger can disseminate throughout the cabin and cause infections in fellow passengers [5], [6]. Therefore, it is important to accurately model the person-to-person particle transport in mechanical ventilated spaces in order to improve air distribution design to reduce the infection risk.",

            "text": "In recent years, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been widely used in modeling airflow field and particle transport in enclosed environments, such as buildings [7], aircraft cabins [8], and hospital rooms [9]. For airflow modeling, there are several turbulence models such as Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) models, Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), which have that has been reviewed and tested [10], [11]. For particle modeling, Eulerian and Lagrangian are two popular methods. The Eulerian method often uses the drift flux model for considering the slippage between particle phase and fluid (air) phase. This model performed well in modeling indoor particle dispersion [12], [13], [14]. The Lagrangian method with the Discrete Random Walk (DRW) model has also performed very well in modeling and analyzing the particle transport and dispersion [15], [16], [17]. Most of the studies mentioned above focused on steady-state particle transport processes. However, particle transport processes can be in an unsteady state. Wang et al. [18] have tested different combinations of the airflow and particle models for steady- and unsteady-state cases. For steady-state airflow conditions, they preferred the RANS model with the Eulerian method due to the reasonable accuracy and low computing cost associated with the model. For unsteady-state airflow conditions, Wang et al. recommended the DES model with the Lagrangian method due to its relatively high accuracy. The reason for using DES rather than RANS model is that RANS model fails to predict correct transient airflow [11]. Moreover, when the airflow field is still developing, the Lagrangian method may have better accuracy than the Eulerian method since it accounts for more physics of airflow and particle motion [18]. But if the DES with Lagrangian model is applied for studying coughing, talking, and sneezing among persons in an enclosed environment, it requires considerable computing cost.",

This further confirms that Approach_3 can be used as the benchmark. To verify the t\n1 proposed in the previous section, this investigation compared Approach_2a with Approach_3. The results show that they matched very well for the whole field. Although Approach_2a still showed significant discrepancies from the experimental data, it can at least achieve the similar accuracy to Approach_3. Hence, t\n1 = 0.5\u03c4 was long enough to obtain the accurate time-dependent flow distribution under steady-state boundary conditions. This study has correctly estimated the t\n1 for the office case.",

To verify the t\n1 proposed in the previous section, this study compared Approach_2a with Approach_3. In the mid-section along the longitudinal direction, both the approaches predicted an upward motion of the airflow field. The quantitative comparison also showed very good agreement in this section. In the cross-section through the third row, both the approaches again matched well with each other for most of the positions. Although differences can be found at some positions at the upper left side of this section, the general airflow pattern was similar between the two approaches.

With such a short source release time in the experiment, the particle concentrations in the cabin may be too low to be detected by the aerodynamic particle sizer, so the data quality would be poor. Therefore, the source release time should be increased to some extent. Although the increased source release time was different from the real coughing case, the experiment was still meaningful since the aim of this study was to provide reliable experimental data to validate the hybrid model. If the source release time had been too long, the experiment might have become a steady-state case. Hence, the source release time still needs to be as short as possible to meet the purpose of this study, while the particle concentrations at the breathing zone of other manikins should be detectable with the aerodynamic particle sizer. This investigation compared the particle concentration versus time at 1A and 2A under three different source release times: 5, 20, and 60 s, as shown in Fig. 11\n. It can be seen that a 5 s source release time cannot result in obvious particle concentration peaks. A 20 s source release time can generate a peak concentration that is more than 5 times the background concentration. Although a 60 s source release time can result in even higher peaks, this may be too long for a transient particle transport case. Hence, a 20 s source release time was applied in the experiment.",

We suspected that the discrepancies were mainly attributed to the differences between the modeled and measured airflow fields, as shown in Fig. 13\n. Observing the experimental data, very limited portion of particles moved backward, which indicated that the general direction of the airflow above 2C was pointing forward. However, the modeled airflow showed the existence of both the forward and backward directions. Therefore, the modeling results showed that a considerable portion of particles moved backward so that the concentrations at 3B and 3C increased.

            "text": "The validation section has shown that the hybrid model is acceptable for engineering applications. In addition, the hybrid model can significantly reduce the computing cost in two aspects. First, the traditional approach for obtaining the time-dependent flow distribution using the DES model is Approach_2b or Approach_3. However, the hybrid model uses Approach_2a, which can save about 75% of the computing time compared with Appraoch_2b or Approach_3. Secondly, Wang et al. [18] recommended using the DES-Lagrangian model for transient particle transport simulations. The hybrid model uses the DES-Lagrangian model in the first few seconds of the flow time and the RANS-Eulerian model afterward. The RANS-Eulerian model can save about 84% of the computing time compared with the DES-Lagrangian model [18]. The ratio of the computing time by the hybrid model to the DES-Lagrangian model is:(22)ThybridTDES\u2212Lagrangian=tDES\u2212Lagrangian+(1\u221284%)\u00b7tRANS\u2212EuleriantDES\u2212Lagrangian+tRANS\u2212Eulerianwhere t\nDES\u2212Lagrangian and t\nRANS\u2212Eulerian is the computing time used by DES-Lagrangian and RANS-Eulerian, respectively, for the hybrid model. Taking the first-class cabin of the MD-82 aircraft as an example, the t\nDES\u2212Lagrangian and t\nRANS\u2212Eulerian were 22.3 and 477.7 s, respectively. Then T\nhybrid/T\nDES\u2212Lagrangian was only 20%; that is, the hybrid model can save about 80% of the computing time compared with the DES-Lagrangian model. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model can significantly reduce the computing costs.",

To take this factor into account, the super-imposition method proposed by Gupta et al. [29] can be used together with our experimental or modeling data to estimate the effect of multiple coughs. Furthermore, a lot of people attempt to cover their mouth with their hand or a tissue when they cough. However, a model for predicting exhaled particle transport by coughs with covering the mouth with a hand or tissue is not available, which deserves further investigations. Our study simulated a scenario when a coughing passenger who was at sleep so he/she could not cover the mouth when coughing.",

The estimated t\n1 and t\n2 were verified by an office and an aircraft cabin case.(2).This investigation conducted experimental measurements of transient particle distributions in the first-class cabin of an MD-82 aircraft cabin to validate the hybrid model. The results show that the model can predict the trend of the transient particle concentration distribution when compared with the experimental data.(3).The proposed hybrid DES-Lagrangian and RANS-Eulerian model can be used for investigating transient particle transport in enclosed environments with relatively high accuracy, while the computing time can be reduced by 80%.\n",
