Monitoring programmes do exist for theatre surface colonization and others for specific pathogen in clinical areas of risk.22., 23., 24., 25. Recently, attention has focused on areas outside the theatre environment.6., 7., 15. No one set of standards exists for general hospital wards, however, and there is considerable variation in sampling methodologies and quantitative reporting.7., 26. There are further differences in whether sampling is carried out routinely or in response to an infection incident.25., 27. This makes it difficult to compare fluctuating situations in a ward, between wards and between different hospitals, let alone investigate specific levels of contamination in relation to infection risk.",

There is also an index of microbial air contamination (IMA) established for environments at risk, with maximum acceptable levels for different classes of contamination.31 Even recreational waters are analysed for microbial indicators of human sewage and the corresponding health risk.32 It has already been suggested that the surface level environment in hospital wards should be subjected to a similar strategy.7\n",

They are presented after consideration of all available evidence and comprise two main features: first, the identification of an indicator organism of potential high-risk to patients in any amount, and second, the quantitative assessment of organisms found within a specified area, regardless of identity. The latter is included because a heavy burden of any microbes from specified surfaces in a hospital may constitute a risk to patients. It circumvents the difficulties in locating a pathogen, when screening an entire ward. Positive findings for either standard should direct attention to the quality, quantity and methods of cleaning used. These standards would usually be applied before and after cleaning in order to assess efficacy, but could also be used during an outbreak or high-risk incident with a serious pathogen.",

This is based on three suppositions: first, an increased microbial burden suggests that there has been insufficient cleaning. This would increase the chances of finding a pathogen. Second, a heavy microbial burden may mask the finding of a pathogen. Third, a heavy concentration of certain organisms implies an increased chance of finding an epidemiologically related pathogen, e.g. coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus. This surmise forms the basis of WHO standards regarding water quality.32 Repeat sampling should follow a risk evaluation, whether or not there has been a change in practice.",

Important health effects may occur after short-term exposure to low-quality water; while the relevant hazards are multiple, they may share a common source.32 Risk management, reflected in the HACCP principle used by the food industry, encompasses the view that relevant pathogens are widespread, occurring with wide variation in time and space.
