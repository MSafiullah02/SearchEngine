While important, these prior Regulations were quite limited in scope, dealing primarily with three to six infectious diseases, but none of the new, emerging or re-emerging diseases (including those that had become drug resistant), or other critical long-standing diseases. By the 1990s, the version of the Regulations adopted in 1969 had also become outdated in terms of policy and technical approach.2 In the intervening decades, international travel and other traffic flows have increased sharply, and with them the opportunities for globalized disease spread.3 To address these concerns, the World Health Assembly in 19954 commenced the process of revising the Regulations to update them in policy and technical aspects, and to broaden their scope to address the full range of internationally transmissible disease risks, whether currently known or as yet unknown. These newly revised IHR (2005) were adopted by the World Health Assembly on 23 May 20055 and are now in force and legally binding for 191 of WHO's 193 Member States; the last two Member States are expected to become parties in August 2007 and in early 2008.",

This subject was one of the key parts of the negotiations of the WHO Member States resulting in the revised Regulations negotiations. The importance of these protections for national delegations in the negotiations is underlined by the placement of human rights as the first \u2018principle\u2019 articulated in Paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the Regulations, requiring that the \u2018implementation of these Regulations shall be with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons\u2019.",

The broad scope of the IHR (2005) in terms of their global geographic coverage, the important subjects they cover, their coverage of an expansive array of diseases and public health events, and the escalating numbers of international travellers worldwide contributes to the potential overall impact of these new legal provisions. At the same time, the IHR (2005) are only now entering into force, and the practices under, and interpretations of, the new Regulations by States Parties, WHO and other international actors are in the process of being established. As with many complex, freshly negotiated international legal instruments, the precise meaning or import of some provisions, and how they may relate to other articles in the Regulations or other relevant international instruments in particular circumstances, may not always be readily apparent. This article presents a summary description of some of the key provisions and some of the issues that they raise.",

More specifically, the fundamental term \u2018disease\u2019 is defined as \u2018an illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source that presents or could present significant harm to humans\u2019. As indicated in Table 1\n, the definitions of other key terms, such as \u2018event\u2019 and \u2018public health risk\u2019, are similarly broad. In terms of notifying diseases and events to WHO, for example, States Parties are obligated to notify any public health \u2018event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern\u2019 based on specified criteria, as well as other international public health risks.",

Under the 1969 Regulations, protections for travellers were often stated in the context of limitations on health measures that countries could implement against the three \u2018quarantinable\u2019 diseases (cholera, plague and yellow fever) covered under the Regulations since 1981. For example, the prior Regulations prohibited vaccination against plague as a condition of entry to a State, as well as rectal swabbing in the context of cholera. Under the revised IHR (2005), with the expanded coverage of disease, the scope of regulation of health measures applicable to international travellers is also broadened in light of the many covered diseases that may be spread by persons on an international voyage. Some of the other, more prominent current diseases of concern include: polio; tuberculosis (particularly drug-resistant tuberculosis); influenza; Ebola and Marburg viral haemorrhagic fevers; meningococcal disease; West Nile fever; and severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

Additional provisions address when international travellers may be denied entry to a country on public health grounds. In the context of an event that has been determined by the Director-General of WHO to be a public health emergency of international concern, Article 15 provides that the Director-General will also issue specific temporary recommendations under the IHR (2005) of appropriate health measures to prevent or reduce spread of the disease and interference with international traffic. In Article 18, the Regulations contain a non-exclusive list of 13 potentially relevant recommendations applicable to persons as appropriate to the circumstances (as well as others for baggage, cargo, containers and conveyances), from advice that no specific measures are appropriate, to advice that States require vaccination or prophylaxis, to recommending implementation of contact tracing or potential exit screening or other restrictions on persons from affected areas.",

In contrast to most other related provisions, which refer to (international) \u2018travellers\u2019, this principle expressly refers to \u2018persons\u2019, a potentially broader category. Although not as explicit on this issue, another principle mandates that implementation of the Regulations is also to \u2018be guided by the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitution of the World Health Organization\u2019, which can also provide guidance on evaluating application of IHR (2005) provisions to travellers, whether denominated as \u2018human rights\u2019 or otherwise.

In more concrete terms, the article specifically requires that States Parties minimize this discomfort or distress by \u2018providing or arranging for adequate food and water, appropriate accommodation and clothing, protection for baggage\u2026, appropriate medical treatment, means of necessary communication\u2026 and other appropriate assistance for travellers who are quarantined, isolated or subject to medical examinations or other procedures for public health purposes\u2019.

This was another intensely debated set of issues during the negotiations. In general, the IHR (2005) requirements distinguish between charges for vaccinations or prophylaxis provided on arrival (which are not generally prohibited from being charged to the traveller under the Regulations unless the charges were not published at least 10 days earlier) and certain other measures that may generally not be charged to the traveller, such as medical examinations under the Regulations or supplemental examinations required to ascertain the traveller's health status, appropriate isolation or quarantine requirements, any certificates issued to a traveller documenting the measures applied, health measures applied to baggage, and vaccination or other prophylaxis requirements that were not published in advance as required. In addition, where such charges are permitted, each State Party must have a single tariff for them, they may not exceed the actual cost of the service rendered, and the charge must not discriminate based upon nationality, domicile or residence of the traveller concerned. However, these restrictions on charges do not apply to travellers seeking temporary or permanent residence or to charges for health measures that are not implemented primarily for a public health purpose.",

Most of the above provisions, but not all of them (the general \u2018principle\u2019 in Article 3.1 refers to \u2018persons\u2019), refer to treatment of \u2018travellers\u2019. Although it may not turn out to be an issue in \u2018real life\u2019, there may be questions about the status of particular individuals (see definition of \u2018international voyage\u2019 applicable to travellers). Theoretically at least, a related set of issues may arise in events involving both (international) travellers, to whom the IHR (2005) would generally apply, as well as local nationals, perhaps those in or near a port or airport. Separately, it should be noted that some of these provisions exclude travellers who are seeking temporary or permanent residence from the otherwise broader category of travellers covered under the Regulations, as in Article 31.1 (concerning health-related entry requirements for travellers) and Article 35 (concerning requirements for health documents in international travel).",
