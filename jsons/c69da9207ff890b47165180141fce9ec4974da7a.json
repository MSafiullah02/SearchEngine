We find significant efficiency gaps between different group testing strategies in realistic scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 testing, highlighting the need for an informed decision of the pooling protocol depending on estimated prevalence, target specificity, and high-vs. low-risk population. For example, using one of the presented methods, all 1.47 million inhabitants of Munich, Germany, could be tested using only around 141 thousand tests if an infection rate up to 0.4% is assumed. Using 1 million tests, the 6.69 million inhabitants from the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, could be tested as long as the infection rate does not exceed 1%. Altogether this work may help provide a basis for efficient upscaling of current testing procedures, fine grained towards the desired study population, e.g. cross-sectional versus health-care workers and adapted mixtures thereof. For comparative visualization and querying of the precomputed results we provide an interactive web application. The source code for computation is open and freely available. * C. M. Verdun and T.

Often, the test proceeds by arranging the specimens in a two-dimensional array and assembling all the specimens of each column in a pool, and then all the specimens of each row also in a pool [32] . This testing strategy is a special instance of the so-called array testing, already mentioned in Section 1. In this way, every specimen is included in exactly two pools. All the specimens in the intersection of two pools with positive test results have to be retested in a second stage, but the number of these individual tests can be considerably smaller than for the Dorfman design. The animated Figure 2 illustrates the array testing procedure for a 10 \u00d7 10 microplate with two infected individuals; here only four of the 100 specimens need to be retested.",

It is important to note, however, that master pooling should be used when there are no clear restrictions on the pool size, e.g., given by dilution effects. In case that such effects are not present, as claimed recently at least for small pool sizes [13] , master pooling strategies could be explored.

A first attempt to make use of such a stratification for SARS-CoV-2 testing has recently been made with two subpopulations in [18] . This paper, however, only assembles homogeneous pools within the two subpopulations and hence does not make use of the full power of informative testing.

There is little such data for COVID-19 testing right now. To this end, [38] analysed the positive test result rate of qRT-PCR tests on COVID-19 patients identified based on symptoms, where the symptom-based diagnosis served as a ground truth. They found false negative rates of individual tests of around 11% to 25% on sputum samples. At the same time, false-positive rates are hard to estimate in the current situation in which non-symptomatic infections occur at unknown frequency and because of the lack of reference gold-standard labels for positive observations that are non-symptomatic. However, as sample collection does likely contribute little to false positive rates, the overall false positive rate of a group test would largely depend on the qRT-PCR stage in which there is reason to believe that it should be small. Some previous studies on the use of PCR for similar infectious diseases such as SARS-like viruses as well as for SARS-CoV-2 reported high sensitivity for PCR [36, 39] . Indeed, in the absence of cell culture methods, qRT-PCR tests are considered to be the gold standard for the identification and diagnosis of most pathogen.",

Also, on a intuitive level, one may think that the higher the prevalence, the higher the expected number of tests should be. In fact, Yao and Hwang proved that the minimum of the expected number of tests with respect to all possible test strategies should be nondecreasing with respect to p, if p < (3 \u2212 \u221a 5)/2 [49] . Therefore, in the COVID-19 pandemic where the prevalence in most countries, both among the tested individuals and the entire population is clearly believed to be smaller than the threshold provided by Ungar's theorem, one can expect a significant reduction in average number of tests by employing suitable group testing methods.

Then a pooling procedure similar to the first stage is performed for the remaining, still unlabeled, specimens, and this scheme is repeated until all specimens are labeled. While requiring a smaller number of tests per individual on average, especially for small infection rates [22] , the number of stages which need to be performed sequentially is not known a priori and may be very high. As such Sterrett's method is more involved in practice, while D2 is a simple and straightforward procedure. Thus the latter is often preferred in applications, which is also why we will perform the simulations for the original form of D2 in this paper.",

As shown for example in [63] , informative testing reduces the expected number of tests per individual even further when compared with their corresponding non-informative counterparts. As argued by them, it is crucial to exploit this heterogeneity and employ an efficient mixing strategy of individuals from both subpopulations to form the pools. Our goal here has a different perspective on how to exploit such strategies as will be discussed in the next section. It sheds light on testing methodologies where as much individuals as possible should be tested with the available tests while subject to the constraint of constantly testing high-risk individuals such as HCWs.",

We will investigate different infection scenarios with the different group testing methods described above. We apply the tests D2, D3, A2, and A1 j with overall prevalence varying from 0.25% to 15%.

In Tables 2, 3 and 4, we will illustrate (potential) efficiency increase assuming a sensitivity of 99% and 90%, respectively, for the qRT-PCR test. As mentioned before, extensive tests are currently being performed to confirm the high accuracy of qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

For infection rates as high as 2%, up to 5 times as many individuals compared to amount of available tests can be tested using adaptive methods. For a low prevalence below 0.5% this number varies between a 7 to 15-fold efficiency increase. Figure 7 shows the efficiency improvement of A1 j compared to the corresponding adaptive method. The specificity reduction, the biggest drawback of the proposed non-adaptive methods, is controlled by setting the threshold to 90%, 95% and 97%. Naturally, the methods relying on the lowest threshold show the biggest improvement. The suggested threshold of 95% leads to a significant improvement of A1 2 compared to D2 for an infection rate between 0.4% and 5%. A1 3 significantly exceeds A2 and D3 for a prevalence between 2.5% and 5%. This is exemplified by some numerical examples in Table 1 ; for example, this entails that for an infection rate of 0.4%, the city of Munich with 1,47 million inhabitants could be tested with only 141,000 tests using D3, the 6,69 million inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro could be tested using around 1 million tests if the infection rate does not exceed 1.0% and the adaptive methods D3 or A2 are performed. If a false positive rate up to 5% is considered acceptable, the non-adaptive method A1 2 would only require 836,000 tests and at the same time allow for higher prevalence values of up to 1.5%.",

This is of fundamental importance since transmission before the onset of symptoms has been commonly reported and asymptomatic cases seem to be very common [68] . For example, 328 of the 634 positive cases on board of the formerly quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship were asymptomatic at the time of testing, which corresponds to 52% of the cases. Another study conducted in a homeless shelter in Boston, MA, USA, confirmed that standard COVID-19 symptoms like cough, shortness of breath, and fever were uncommon among individuals who tested positive [69] and strongly argues for universal PCR testing on that basis. Also, besides enhancing the tests of mild/asymptomatic cases, some disease control centers, such as the ECDC, recommend that group testing should potentially be applied to prevalence studies [70] .",

As for any nucleic acid amplification tests, one can only identify cases where virus particles can still be detected. Thus for long-term disease monitoring, NAATs will have to be complemented by serological tests, as these can be used to infer the immunity state of a patient and hence identify past asymptomatic infections through detection of disease-specific antibodies. Such tests have already been deployed in a few cases [73, 74] . In contrast to the PCR testing procedures mainly discussed in this paper, the main intention of serological testing is to obtain accurate estimations of the number of unidentified previous infections as a measure for the progress towards herd immunity. Group testing can also be expected to yield accuracy gains for this problem. Namely, group testing for prevalence estimation is an active area of research with many recent advancements [20, 75] and we are confident that some of these results can be employed once pooled tests become available.",

Nevertheless, Table 3 indicates the opposite for low infection rates and sensitivity Se = 0.99. While for 0.1% prevalence 0.140 tests per individual are expected, this improves to E = 0.139 for p = 0.2%. The explanation for such oscillatory pattern comes from the general implementation of A2's expected number of tests per person in the binGroup package [64] where plausibility checks are done. As mentioned in Subsection 3.2.3 for Se, Sp < 1, in a scenario where a positive row/column group but not a single positive column/row group are found, individual tests of the positive row/column group should be performed. In a low prevalence setting, those additional tests have a higher impact and lead to the oscillation. As a side note, from a theoretical perspective, the oscillations in the expected number of tests per person for low prevalence do not contradict the theorem by Yao and Hwang [49] since the theorem concerns the minimum over all possible strategies and this one, even though can be a very good method for the current purposes, does not achieve the theoretical minimum.",
