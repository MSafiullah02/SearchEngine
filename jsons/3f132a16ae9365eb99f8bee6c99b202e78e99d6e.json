This allows the operator to rebreathe 11 his expired (but hopefully uncontaminated) air for a limited time during the procedure. While this 12 might offer better protection from infection than current CDC recommendations for homemade 13 cloth masks in situations of last resort, it also introduces risks of hypoxia and hypercarbia due to 14 rebreathing 1,2 . 15 16 Experiments on rebreathing have previously been reported, but were performed under sufficiently 17 different conditions (breathing directly into a bag placed around the mouth) that extrapolation of 18 results to the above setup might not be meaningful 2,3 . 19 20", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 163, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "To study the limitations of the described setup, two of the authors (one male and one female in their 21 thirties with no prior cardiorespiratory disease) volunteered to have 70L plastic bags pre-filled with 22 environmental air placed around their heads with an airtight seal around their necks. Heart rate and 23 rhythm, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored. The gas composition in the bag 24 (fraction of inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressure) was continuously sampled with the gas analyzer module of an anesthesia machine (M-CAIOV, Datex Ohmeda, GE, USA) via a sampling 26 line inserted into the bag. Each run was aborted when symptoms experienced were felt to be 27 significant enough to impair the capacity to safely carry out a medical procedure such as 28 endotracheal intubation. At termination, time elapsed and subject's end-tidal carbon dioxide partial 29 pressure were recorded. The experiments were then repeated with the same bags pre-filled with 30 oxygen before use. (Results in Table 1 .) 31 32 In all cases, bag partial pressures of carbon dioxide rose quickly, resulting in significant hypercarbia 33 at termination. This accounted for the breathlessness (the primary symptom that resulted in 34 termination of the experiments), anxiety and distress that both authors reported nearing the end of 35 each run. Overall, the mean duration tolerated was short, although longer when bags were pre-36 filled with oxygen (5min vs 7.5min). Only the environment in bags pre-filled with air became 37 hypoxic, although no oxygen desaturation below 94% occurred. These findings are consistent with 38 our understanding of physiology, with hypercarbia being the major contributor of dyspnoea and 39 limiting factor for tolerance in this situation, secondarily compounded by hypoxia 4 . 40", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1027, "end": 1034, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Our study demonstrates that users under real-life conditions will be under time pressure to 42 complete all but the shortest procedures and subjected to distressing physiological and 43 psychological effects during use. They may also risk hypoxia (especially if the bag is not pre-filled 44 with oxygen) and serious carbon dioxide toxicity in situations where the option to abort an 45 unexpectedly prolonged procedure may not be possible without resulting in significant patient 46 harm 5 . In addition, our findings suggest that pre-filling the bags with oxygen may obviate the need for continuous oxygen insufflation via additional tubing during use since hypercarbia will limit use in 48 this context long before hypoxia develops. This will have the advantage of simplifying the setup and reducing the risk that an already vulnerable seal quality may be further compromised by the need to 50 allow for additional inflow tubings. 51 52 If faced with no alternative but the use of such PPE, we suggest the following: choosing as 53 generously-sized a bag as possible without sacrificing functionality, trial runs to assess individual 54 tolerance before actual use, and preoxygenation of bag and/or user (and possibly mild 55 hyperventilation) before donning to delay the onset of hypoxia and hypercarbia.
