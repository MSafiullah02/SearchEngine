Compounds (VI-X) did not exhibit significant antiviral activity. Antiviral activity of GA conjugates (IV) and (V) was studied against other influenza virus subtypes ( Virus-inhibiting activity of compounds (IV) and (V) was studied in the MA-104 cell culture with respect to the standard human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). The results for compound (V) are presented in Table 2 . Conjugate (V) was found to be active against the HRSV virus as well, efficiently inhibiting replication of the virus (EC 50 18.8 \u03bcg/mL, SI > 25). Compound (IV), even at a concentration of 6.3 \u03bcg/mL, caused degradation of cell monolayer in the given model. Therefore, antiviral activity of this group of GA conjugates with respect to studied influenza virus and HRSV subtypes depended on the structure of amino acid residue and the ester group. Even for structurally related compounds, such as conjugates (IV) and (V) differing only by a single methylene group (methyl vs. ethyl ester), activity differed considerably. EXPERIMENTAL 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were registered on an Avance-III (Br\u00fcker, Germany) pulse spectrometer at a working frequency of 500.13 ( 1 H) and 125.47 ( 13 C) MHz and an AVX-300 (Br\u00fcker) spectrometer at working frequencies of 300 and 75.5 MHz (\u03b4, ppm; spinspin coupling constant, Hz); internal standard, tetramethylsilane. NMR spectral signals were referenced under common mode using the ACD LABS software package and literature data for GA and its amino acid conjugates [6, [9] [10] [11] . IR spectra were recorded on a Prestige-21 (Shimadzu, Japan) IR spectrophotometer in a paste with paraffin oil. Optical activity was measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 (Germany) polarimeter in a 1-dm tube at 20-22\u00b0C (\u03bb Na 546 nm). Melting points were determined on a Boetius apparatus. Elemental analysis data matched the calculated values.",

Studies were conducted on a primary culture of dog kidney cells MDCK for all influenza viruses and MA-104 cells, for human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). For screening of antiviral activity of the conjugates, reference virus A/Pert/16/09(H3N2) was used. Antiviral effect of the most active compounds was studied on international standard influenza virus strains of various subtypes: A/California/07/09(H1N1)pdm09, avian influenza virus A/NIBRG/14/H5N1, influenza virus B/Brisben/60/08, as well as the HRSV standard.",

Immediately before the experiment, the standard solution was diluted with cell incubation medium 100-fold, so that the final DMSO concentration did not exceed 1% (maximum concentration affording unaffected cell viability and metabolism). Therefore, the maximum working concentration of the compounds was 200 \u03bcg/mL. Toxicity of GA conjugates (IV) and (V) was studied at higher concentrations (>500 \u03bcg/mL). Further on, a series of six two-fold dilutions was prepared (to produce solutions of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.13 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) with MDCK cell growth medium (\u03b1-\u041c\u0415\u041c, Biolot, Russia), which were used to evaluate the conjugate toxicity. The compounds were introduced into a one-day MDCK culture grown in 96-well plates, then the plates were incubated for 20 [ ] D \u03b1 72 h at 37\u00b0\u0421 in the presence of 5% CO 2 . After visual evaluation of cytotoxicity by the level of monolayer integrity, toxicity was determined quantitatively by measuring the residual ability of cell in culture to reduce a tetrazole dye MTT (thiazolyl blue) by mitochondrial and partially cytoplasmic dehydrogenases of cells. The intensity of the reducing dye color restoration correlates with cell viability rate. The test is often used in virology for evaluation of cytopathogenic effect of viruses on cells [15] . Its results can be interpreted as the level of cell stability towards the effect of viruses. The microtetrazolium test is also widely used to evaluate the effects of the toxicants, pharmacological preparations, and unfavorable environmental factors on cells [16] . The MTT reduction was assayed on a Varioscan (ThermoFischer) microplate reader at 550 nm. Median toxic concentration (CTD 50 ) was determined by photometry analysis of the results by using linear regression in Excel 2010 software.",
