            "text": "Effective disease control requires a strong partnership between clinicians and public health personnel. The vital role medical practitioners play is reflected globally in the obligation under health legislation for medical practitioners to notify the public health authority of specific details of named patients suspected of having these diseases. While the principle is universal that the notification include the identity of the patient, to allow prompt and direct public health action, if needed, jurisdictions have varying approaches to many other aspects of notification: the actual list of notifiable conditions; who must notify and based on what degree of diagnostic certainty; in what timeframe and with what specific details; what information is to be provided to the case; and who bears responsibility for contact tracing. In addition, in some jurisdictions, medical practitioners have associated statutory obligations and powers, related to the examination of a patient directed for assessment by the public health authority, the furnishing of reports of such examinations, the role of the practitioner in ordering a patient into isolation, and responsibilities of medical practitioners in public health emergencies. Following a concise historical survey, finishing with the impact of the International Health Regulations 2005, this chapter systematically discusses the statutory obligations of medical practitioners for disease notification and related provisions, taking examples from English-language public health legislation used in Oceania, Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa.",

It is acknowledged that many cultures, Western and Eastern, ancient and more recent, developed practices which were concerned with preventing the transmission of infection from one person to another. Some examples are the use of variolation to prevent cases of smallpox and the more recent invention of vaccination, using material from cowpox sores, for the same purpose; the isolation of lepers; distribution of clean drinking water through reticulated systems protected from sewage contamination; drainage of swamps to eliminate mosquitoes responsible for malaria transmission; and the enforcement of quarantine of vessels carrying diseased individuals.",

Broad public health laws were a nineteenth century development. Chadwick's landmark exploration of the health impact of the industrial revolution, his 1842 Report on the sanitary condition of the labouring population, found that, particularly in overcrowded, poorer quarters of the industrial cities, the population was virtually living among rivers and lakes of sewage [2] . Despite the increasing application of the scientific method, by the early Victorian period, the germ theory had not yet gained acceptance and the generally understood cause of what we now know as infectious diseases was the emanation called \"miasma\" arising from the raw sewage and rotting material that contaminated much of the urban environment. Chadwick's report and a resurgence of the second cholera pandemic together forced the British parliament to pass the Public Health Act in 1848 \"An act for promoting public health.\" This legislation required local government authorities to employ staff responsible for public health: the medical officers of health and inspectors of nuisances [3] . These two disciplines provided, respectively, the capacity to assess illness among members of their local communities, and the power to examine the living conditions of those communities and to remove the sources of \"miasma\" to which were attributed what we now know as infectious diseases.",

In the particular case of Victoria, between 1854 and the passage of its most recent statute, the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008, there were 20 separate versions of the Public Health Act or as it was known for most of this period, the Health Act, as well as numerous brief amending Acts. Some of the requirements, under earlier Acts, are no longer considered necessary, such as the \"Infant life protection\" powers introduced in 1883 to register and regulate people who nurse and feed infants under the age of 2 years, or the requirement for compulsory smallpox vaccination. Other provisions have been transferred to separate legislation, such as those related to food and drug safety, fire precautions, building of public hospitals and prohibition on growing of narcotic plants; quarantine powers were ceded to the Commonwealth of Australia upon its establishment.",

In Sydney, a medical practitioner wrote, not long after, to the British Medical Journal with an anecdote which casts a little light on the tensions around disease control legislation and the role of medical practitioners. He stated that a fatal case of smallpox in the Sydney epidemic had failed to be reported by the patient's physician, who was subsequently censured by the members of the local branch of the British Medical Association. He goes on to say that very soon after this meeting was publicized, the NSW parliament passed the Infectious Diseases Supervision Act, which made notification of smallpox compulsory by medical practitioners, at pain of 50 pounds [currency] penalty [5] .",

The occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and continuing threat of highly pathogen avian influenza viruses with potential to become communicable to and between humans prompted a complete reevaluation and eventual re-design of the International Health Regulations. The new Regulations are based around the obligation of all countries to report to the World Health Organisation, rather than just three diseases, any \"events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern.\" This reporting must be undertaken by signatory countries through a \"national focal point.\" In order to meet this obligation, countries are required to develop their capacity for surveillance and response to such an extent that they will be able to detect a significant public health event and, by an appropriate investigation, determine whether it reaches the threshold for notification to the World Health Organisation [6] .",

This is effected by limiting the number of diseases they must notify to those readily diagnosed in the primary healthcare setting, for example, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) and making the conditions notifiable by hospital personnel those which should most likely require admission to hospital for assessment and diagnosis, for example, typhoid fever or meningococcal disease.

A more recent approach further acknowledges the advantage whereby a new disease can be reported, even before there is time for it to be listed in regulations, at the same time recognizing that it is the astute medical practitioner, seeing multiple cases, who will be in the best position to draw the attention of public health authorities to a new syndrome. This approach is also consistent with the generic all-risk regime of the International Health Regulations 2005 which require countries to report to the World Health Organisation any \"events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern.\" The practical effect of this approach is evident in the Hong Kong administrative requirement for medical practitioners to report a suspected outbreak or case of infectious disease that is rare, severe, or important, that is not specified in the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance 2008. The England Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 incorporate an all-risk regime. In addition to the specified notifiable diseases, a registered medical practitioner is to notify a situation whereby a patient suffers an infection or contamination, namely, of a chemical or radiological substance, which, in the practitioner's opinion, presents, or could present, significant risk to human health [9] . The Code of Massachusetts Regulation on Reportable Diseases, Surveillance and Isolation and Quarantine Requirements 2008 requires reporting of \"illness believed to be unusual.\" The NSW Public Health Act 2010 differs from the previous Act of 1991 in providing the option for a medical practitioner to notify details of a patient who \"is suffering from a medical condition or disease that may pose a significant risk to public health\" other than one that is already listed as a notifiable condition [10] .",

Acute rheumatic fever is listed as a clinical diagnosis notifiable condition whereas acute viral hepatitis is a provisional diagnosis notifiable condition.

This would be an important advance for surveillance of notifiable conditions; it should be emphasized that the best communication of a condition which requires an urgent public health response is a telephone call, during which the local public health authority may ascertain important information on exposure, disease timing, and contacts while the medical practitioner may receive valuable advice about testing, case definitions, and other aspects of patient management [8] .",

The Public Health Act 1991 places HIV infection and AIDS in their own category; it recognizes the serious public health risk potentially posed by infected individuals and at the same time provides strong sanctions against revealing the identity of cases to third parties -including public health authorities -except in extreme situations of actual public health risk or with the consent of the individual. Such confidentiality provisions, with respect to HIV/ AIDS, can be found in public health legislation in many jurisdictions. The Singapore Infectious Diseases Act 1976 takes the presumption that identity of an individual with HIV/AIDS is not to be disclosed but provides legislative clarity by including a comprehensive listing, within the Act, of situations in which the identity may, or may not, be revealed. The Act sets a clear obligation on the public health authority to inform contacts of the identity of the case. This requires the notifying medical practitioner to provide the case's identity to the authority. This disclosure power is also available to medical practitioners if they consider that a spouse, partner, or other contact is at significant risk of infection, that the case understands the risk to others but the medical practitioner forms the view that the case will not inform his or her contacts.",

The duty of the medical practitioner to counsel the case about means of preventing exposure of contacts is present in much public health legislation, for example, the US Model State Public Health Act proposes that the treating medical practitioner advise the case of \"measures for preventing reinfection and spread of the disease.\" The New Zealand Health Act 1956 and the NSW Public Health Act 2010 take a narrower approach and require the practitioner to counsel only patients who have been diagnosed with a notifiable sexually transmitted infection on means to prevent further spread.

The legislation may list a small number of communicable diseases considered of greatest public health concern if allowed to spread or may refer to notifiable infectious diseases generally. The situation in which such provisions have been most commonly applied has been that of the case of the individual with active pulmonary tuberculosis who has, for whatever reasons, not complied with the antimicrobial treatment that will render him or her noninfectious to others. In such cases, detention has been ordered to ensure the patient can be treated, while the emergence of extensive drug resistance among occasional Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates has prompted some authorities to detain patients in extreme circumstances such as prison settings due to anxieties about the \"escape\" into the community of practically untreatable strains [16] . In relation to tuberculosis, detention is both expensive and damaging due to its psychological effect on healthcare workers cast in the role of jailers; it is recommended that other means be found to induce compliance of the patient with medical directions [17, 18] .",

Where medical practitioners are mentioned, it is generally to say that a patient must submit to examination by a medical practitioner; sometimes, as in the UK Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, the practitioner is nominated by the authority. These provisions may then open the way for the authority to direct medical practitioners to take certain actions in respect of such patients. The Singapore Infectious Diseases Act 1976 requires a practitioner to furnish the authority with any information required for control of a disease or outbreak -this is a broad requirement and may apply to either a disease notification or information obtained following assessment of a patient directed under the Act to submit to medical examination. When a patient is directed under the Malta Public Health Act 2003 to have a medical examination by the public health authority, the Act requires the medical practitioner to conduct the examination promptly and to furnish a written report to the authority, with penalties provided if the practitioner fails to do so. The Victoria Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 obliges the medical practitioner to provide written results of the examination or specified tests to both the authority and the patient.",

Nurses and medical practitioners have been victims of such emergencies, as a result of their close contact with cases, the 1918-1919 \"Spanish\" influenza H1N1 pandemic being a well-recognized example [19] . The experience of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), with its high morbidity and mortality in hospital staff, identified reluctance among some healthcare workers to care for cases because of quite reasonable concerns for their own health or for the health of their own family members [20, 21] . The Ontario Health Protection and Promotion Act 1990 was amended in 2007 to allow the public health authority to direct medical practitioners and other healthcare providers to use personal protective clothing and equipment during an infectious disease outbreak.",

Medical practitioners, in clinical practice, have a vital role in the control of diseases of public health concern. This role is reflected globally in the obligation, under health legislation, for medical practitioners to notify the public health authority of specific details of named patients suspected of having these diseases. While the principle is universal that the notification include the identity of the patient, so as to allow prompt and direct public health action if needed, jurisdictions have varying approaches to many other aspects of notification: the actual list of notifiable conditions; who must notify and based on what degree of diagnostic certainty; in what timeframe and with what specific details; what information is to be provided to the case; and who bears responsibility for contact tracing. In some jurisdictions, medical practitioners have associated statutory obligations and powers, related to the examination of a patient directed by the public health authority to be assessed, the furnishing of reports of such examinations, the role of the practitioner in ordering a patient into isolation, and responsibilities of medical practitioners in public health emergencies.",
