            "text": "One of the important considerations relative to measuring the immunologic benefits of breast milk is the exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding. The basic concept is identifying a dose-response relationship between the amount of breast milk received by an infant during the period of observation and the immunologic benefit gained with greater exclusivity and duration equaling greater volume of breast milk or \u201cdose.\u201d Dr. Labbok and Krasovec149 have carefully defined breastfeeding in terms of the patterns of breastfeeding relative to the amount of supplementation with formula or other fluids or foods (full/nearly full, medium or equal, low partial, or token) to standardize the use of equatable terms in different studies. Box 5-1\noutlines these definitions of the \u201camount\u201d of breastfeeding.153 Raisler et al227 referred to a dose-response relationship when they studied the effect of \u201cdose\u201d of breast milk on preventing illness in more than 7000 infants. \u201cFull breastfeeding\u201d was associated with the lowest rates of illness (diarrhea, cough, or wheeze) and even children with \u201cmost\u201d or \u201cequal\u201d breastfeeding had evidence of lower odds ratios of ear infections and certain other illnesses. A number of other long-term studies demonstrated greater protection from infection with increased exclusivity of breastfeeding and durations of at least 3 months.\u2217\nA couple papers demonstrated a \u201cdose\u201d effect relative to decreased occurrence of late onset sepsis in very low-birth-weight infants73 and premature infants245 associated with the infants receiving at least 50 mL/kg per day of mother\u2019s milk compared with receiving other nutrition. The current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics reinforce the importance of the dose-response relationship between breastfeeding and the benefits of breastfeeding when it recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and at least partial breastfeeding after the introduction of solid foods for an additional 12 months or longer.1 Another important consideration relative to exclusive breastfeeding is the potential effect of other foods and fluids in an infant\u2019s diet that could negatively influence immunologic benefits and infection-protective effects at the level of the GI mucosa.BOX 5-1Breastfeeding Definitions\n\nFrom Lawrence RM and Pane CA: Human breast milk: current concepts of immunology and infectious diseases.

Immune systems rapidly adapt in the postnatal period related to the natural maturation of the skin and mucosal barriers and in response to the exposure of infants to inhaled and ingested antigens and microbial agents in the extrauterine environment. Infants\u2019 immune systems develop throughout at least the first 2 years of life. Overall, infants have limited abilities to respond effectively and quickly to infectious challenges, which explains infants\u2019 ongoing susceptibility to infections.\u2020\nBox 5-2\nlists most of the better understood deficiencies in infants\u2019 immune systems. An extensive discussion of these developmental immune deficiencies affecting infants is presented by Lawrence and Pane.153 The B-lymphocytes and immunoglobulin production are deficient in the amount and specificity of antibodies produced. There is limited isotype switching and slow maturation of the antibody response to specific antigens (polysaccharides).114., 177. The systemic cell-mediated immune response, including effector and memory T-cells is functionally limited in its response in infants.253., 273., 280. Neutrophil activity in infants is also developmentally delayed, which directly contributes to infants\u2019 susceptibility to invasive bacterial infections during the first months of life.158., 172., 250., 258., 281. The complement system in infants is characterized by low levels of complement components, and both the \u201cclassical\u201d and alternative pathways have limitations for complement activation.2., 63., 251., 277. Numerous immune components are produced in limited amounts in infancy, including complement, interferon-\u03b3, secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A, interleukins (IL-3, IL-6, IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, lactoferrin, and lysozyme.45., 87.\nBOX 5-2Developmental Defects in NewbornsPhagocytes (function matures over the first 6 months of life):\nLimited reserve production of phagocytes in response to infectionPoor adhesion molecule function for migrationAbnormal transendothelial migrationInadequate chemotactic responseQualitative deficits in hydroxyl radical productionDecreased numbers of phagocytes reaching the site of infection\nCell-mediated immunity:\nLimited numbers of mature functioning (memory) T-cells (gradual acquisitionof memory T cells throughout childhood)Decreased cytokine production: IFN-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10Diminished NK cell cytolytic activity (matures by 6 months of age)Limited antibody-dependent cytotoxic cell activityPoor stimulation of B cells (subsequent antibody production, isotype switching)\nB-Lymphocytes and immunoglobulins:\nLimited amounts and repertoire of active antibody productionPoor isotype switching (primarily IgM and IgG1 produced in neonates)IgG1 and IgG3 production is limited (matures at 1 to 2 years of age)IgG2 and IgG4 production is delayed (matures at 3 to 7 years of age)Serum IgA levels are low (less than adult levels through 6 to 8 years of age)Deficient opsonization by immunoglobulinsPoor response to T-cell independent antigens (polysaccharides)(matures at 2 to 3 years of age)\nComplement cascade:\nDecreased function in both the classical and the alternative pathwaysInsufficient amounts of C5a\nFrom Table 2, page 22, Lawrence RM and Pane CA: Human breast milk: current concepts of immunology and infectious diseases, Curr Probl Pediatr 37:1-44, 2007.",

An association has been recognized between the number of placental membranes and the relative importance of the placenta and the colostrum as sources of antibodies. By this analysis, horses, with six placental membranes, pass little or no antibodies transplacentally and rely totally on colostrum for protection of foals. Humans and monkeys, having three placental membranes, receive more of the antibodies via the placenta and less from the colostrum. The transfer of IgG in humans is accomplished by active transport mechanism of the immunoglobulin across the placenta. Secretory IgA (sIgA) immunoglobulins are found in human milk and provide local protection to the mucous membranes of the GI tract. Other investigations have established that the mammary glands and their secretion of milk are important in protecting the infant not only through the colostrum but also through mature milk from birth through the early months of life.",

It is clear that considerable traffic of cells occurs between mucosal epithelia and secretory or lymphoid tissue sites. The data support the concept of a general system of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which includes the gut, lung, mammary gland, salivary and lacrimal glands, and the genital tract (Figure 5-3\n). Through the immune response of MALT, a reaction to an immunogen at a mucosal site may be an effective means of producing immunity at distant sites. Antibodies against specific antigens found in milk have also been found in the saliva, evidence for transfer of protection to two different distant sites simultaneously. Evidence suggests that the mammary glands may act as extensions of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and possibly the bronchiole-associated lymphoid tissue. The ability of epithelial surfaces exposed to the external environment to defend against infectious agents has been well documented for the GI, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts.142 sIgA and secretory IgM (sIgM) produced through the adaptive response of the mucosal-lymphoid immune system act by blocking colonization with pathogens and limiting the passage of harmful antigens across the mucosal barrier. Activated B cells and cytokines pass to the mammary gland where they contribute to the production of sIgA in breast milk. Direct contact between the antigen and the lymphoid cells of the breast is unlikely.202 Peyer patches, tonsils, and other MALT structures appear to be well developed at birth.24 Nevertheless, the actual effective production of sIgA to various antigens presented to infants\u2019 mucosal surfaces (respiratory and GI tracts) is still inadequate to protect against infection. A breastfeeding infant, as part of the maternal-infant dyad exposed to the same antigens via their mucosal services, can receive protective sIgA and sIgM in the mother\u2019s breast milk produced by the mother\u2019s MALT (Figure 5-1).",

Mature milk (i.e., after 4 days) has fewer cells (see Figure 5-3), approximately 105/mL with 20% to 30% PMNs. After 6 weeks, few PMNs are present. The functions of the PMNs normally include microbial killing, phagocytosis, chemotactic responsiveness, stimulated hexose monophosphate shunt activity, stimulated nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, and stimulated oxygen consumption.33 When milk PMNs are compared with those in the serum, their activity is often less than that of serum PMN cells. Whether milk PMNs actually perform a role in protection of the infant has been studied by many investigators using many techniques. Briefly, animal studies have shown that (1) the mammary gland is susceptible to infection in early lactation, (2) a dramatic increase in PMNs occurs with mammary inflammation, and (3) in the presence of peripheral neutropenia during chronic mastitis, severe infection of the gland occurs. This implies, according to Buescher and Pickering,33 that the primary function of milk PMNs is to defend the mammary tissue per se and not to impart immunocompetence to the newborn. This may explain the presence of large numbers of PMNs that are relatively hypofunctional early and then disappear over time. Evidence shows that neutrophils found in human milk demonstrate signs of activation, including increased expression of CD11b (an adherence glycoprotein), decreased expression of L-selectin, spontaneous production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the ability to transform into CD1+ dendritic cells (DCs).125 Human milk macrophages have the morphology and motility of activated cells. The movement of these cells in a three-dimensional system is greater than that of monocytes, their counterparts in peripheral blood. Such activated neutrophils may play a role in phagocytosis at the level of the mucosa of the GI tract, supplementing infants\u2019 poor ability to recruit phagocytes to that site.137\n",

Cells destined to become lymphopoietic cells are derived from two separate influences, the thymus (T) and the bursa (B) or bursal equivalent tissues. The population of the B cells makes up the smaller part of the total. They synthesize IgA antibody. The term B cell is derived from its origination in a different anatomic site from the thymus; in birds, it has been identified as the bursa of Fabricius.

Cell-free, defatted, filtered colostrum as well as mature breast milk showed an enhancing effect on B-cell proliferation and generation of antibody secretion. This was not seen with formula. Juto suggested that this could represent an important immunologic mechanism. Goldblum et al82 were able to show a B-cell response in human colostrum to E. coli given to the mother orally, which was not accompanied by a systemic response in the mother. This suggests that the breast and breast milk reflect sites of local humoral or cell-mediated immunity, which were initially induced at a distant site such as the gut and transferred via reactive lymphoid cells migrating to the breast. Head and Beer115 provided a scheme to describe this mechanism (see Figure 5-1). The diagram depicts the progeny of specifically sensitized lymphocytes that originated in GALT, specifically Peyer patches, as they migrate to the mammary gland. As they infiltrate the mammary gland and its secretion, they supply the breast with immune cells capable of selected immune responses. Ogra and Ogra202., 203. suggest that the cells may selectively accumulate in the breast during pregnancy. The responses of milk cells and their antibodies are not representative of an individual\u2019s total immunity.212 Most of these immunocompetent cells, initially stimulated in GALT, recirculate to the external mucosal surface and populate the lamina propria as antibody-producing plasma cells. A substantial number of these antigen-sensitized cells selectively home-in to the stroma of the mammary glands and initiate local IgA antibody synthesis against the antigens initially encountered in the respiratory or intestinal mucosa.18 More recent work on human-milk-derived B cells demonstrates that breast milk contains activated memory B cells, different than those in the blood. These cells express mucosal adhesion molecules (\u03b14\u03b27\n\u2013/+, \u03b14\u03b21+, CD44+, CD62L\u2013) suggesting origin in the mammary gland, but similar to GALT-associated B cells.265 The mucosae-associated epithelial cytokine CCL28 may contribute to migration of and retention of these cells in the mammary gland.274 This information supports the concept of the mammary gland as an effector site of the mucosal immune system.",

Although postpartum levels fall throughout the next 4 weeks, substantial levels are maintained throughout the first year, during gradual weaning between 6 and 9 months, and even during partial breastfeeding (when infant receives solid foods) in the second year of life (Figure 5-4, Figure 5-5, TABLE 5-2\n).

When the concentrations of sIgA, IgG, IgM, \u03b11-antitrypsin, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and globulins C3 and C4 were compared in relationship to parity and age of the mother, no consistent trend was observed. When maturity of the pregnancy was considered, however, mean concentrations of all these proteins were higher, except for IgA, when the delivery was premature. Because several proteins in human milk have physiologic function in infants, Davidson and L\u00f6nnerdal53 examined the survival of human milk proteins through the GI tract.

Maternal malnutrition was characterized as lower weight-to-height ratio, creatine/height index, total serum proteins, and IgG and IgA. In malnourished mothers, the colostrum contained one third the normal concentration of IgG, less than half the normal level of albumin, and lower IgA and complement C4. Lysozyme, complement C3, and IgM levels were normal. Levels improved with development of mature milk and improvement in maternal nutrition. According to one report in 2003, moderate exercise during lactation does not affect the levels of IgA, lactoferrin, or lysozyme in breast milk.165 Immunologic components contained in human milk during the second year of lactation become a significant point as more infants are nursed longer. For a longitudinal study of lactation into the second year by Goldman et al89 women were included who had fully breastfed their infants for 6 months to a year, and were continuing to partially breastfeed. Samples were collected by fully emptying the breast by electric pump. Table 5-2 summarizes the concentrations of the measured factors. No leukocytes were detected. Concentrations of total IgA and sIgA, lactoferrin, and lysozyme were similar to those 7 to 12 months postpartum and during gradual weaning. sIgA antibodies to E. coli were produced in the second year, demonstrating significant immunologic benefit to the infant with continued breastfeeding.89 IgA, IgM, and IgG were measured in nursing women from the beginning of lactation and simultaneously in the feces of their children by Jatsyk et al130 at the Academy of Medicine in Moscow. They reported IgA to be very high in the milk and rapidly increasing in the feces. IgG and IgM levels, however, were low in both milk and feces. In normal full-term bottle-fed infants, IgA appeared in the feces at 3 to 4 weeks of age but at much lower levels than in breastfed infants. Koutras146 reported that in the first 8 weeks of life increased amounts of sIgA are found in the stools of breastfed infants compared with formula-fed infants. The authors ascribed this phenomenon to the presence of sIgA in human milk and a stimulation of the local GI production of immunoglobulin.",

A bacteriostatic effect of lactoferrin is well established for a wide range of microorganisms, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, anaerobes, viruses, parasites, and fungi. The original proposed mechanism of action for its bacteriostatic effect was depriving the microorganism of iron. A second antibacterial action involving direct action with bacterial surfaces; binding negatively charged molecules (lipoteichoic acid) on the surface of gram-positive bacteria neutralizing the surface charge allowing the action of other antibacterial factors like lysozyme or binding lipid A on gram-negative bacteria, releasing the lipid, producing damage to the cell membrane. Another antibacterial action is binding bacterial adhesions blocking host cell interaction.94 Lactoferrin can kill Candida albicans and C. krusei by changing the permeability of the fungal cell surface. Lactoferrin now is considered a multifunctional, immunoregulatory protein.",

They point out that lactoferrin reversibly binds two ferric ions and that its affinity for iron is 300 times greater than that of transferrin, retaining iron down to a pH of 3. Human lactoferrin is strongly basic. Lactoferrin is normally unsaturated with iron,35 and it is usually less than 10% saturated with iron in human milk.72., 241. Oral iron therapy for an infant can interfere with the bacteriostatic action of lactoferrin, which depends on its unsaturated state for some portion of its bacteriostatic function. Reddy et al229 showed that giving iron to the mother did not interfere with the saturation of lactoferrin in the milk or thus its potential bacteriostatic effect. Protein energy malnutrition, rather than iron supplies, influences lactoferrin synthesis in the mammary gland. Malnourished but non\u2013iron-deficient mothers are lactoferrin deficient.",

Lactoferrin has been shown to limit the formation of biofilms by specific organisms, inhibit adhesion to host cells by other organisms and to directly bind to viral particles of herpes simplex virus, HIV, and adenovirus. A proteolytic action of lactoferrin appears to inactivate virulence factors of some organisms. Separately, lactoferrin binds directly to glycosamino glycans (GAGs) and integrins interrupting the binding of various viruses (herpes simplex virus, HIV, adenovirus, CMV, hepatitis B virus [HBV]) to host cells. Pepsin hydrolysate products of lactoferrin (B or H) may exert a direct bactericidal effect by binding to lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative organisms and disrupting bacterial membranes.263 Lactoferrin may cause an increased release of cytokines by cells including antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10.50., 157. Others have shown that lactoferrin suppresses the release of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, all proinflammatory cytokines, which would be more of an immune-modulating effect.157 Other investigators using a recombinant human lactoferrin (talactoferrin) demonstrated evidence of lactoferrin causing increased maturation of DCs252 and talactoferrin causing the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages 233 as other examples of how lactoferrin affects the innate immune protection of the growing infant. Several other effects have been proposed for lactoferrin, including inhibition of hydroxyl radical formation, decreasing local cell damage; lipopolysaccharide binding, also leading to a diminished inflammatory response; and DNA binding, affecting transcription and possibly regulation of the production of cell products.198 Activation of natural killer (NK) cells, modulation of complement activity, and blocking of adhesion of enterotoxigenic E. coli and Shigella flexneri\n98 are other proposed actions of lactoferrin.",

Oligosaccharides are composed of a basic core structure derived from glucose, galactose, or N-acetylglucosamine and are linked to a variety of terminal fucose linkages or sialic acid linkages to create numerous different compounds. Oligosaccharides compose the major portion of glycoconjugates in milk and are present in the milk-fat globule membrane and in skim milk.188., 192. Gangliosides are glycolipids found in the plasma membrane of cells, especially in cells in the gray matter of the brain. More specifically, gangliosides are glycosphingolipids that contain sialic acid, hexoses, or hexose amines as the carbohydrate component and ceramide as the lipid component of the molecule. The predominant gangliosides in human milk are GM1, GM2, GM3, and GD3, as reported by Newburg.190 A diverse abundance of these complex carbohydrates are synthesized by the many glycosyltransferases contained in the mammary gland. Mucin and lactadherin are two glycoproteins included in this group that have antimicrobial effects.238 Some of these carbohydrate molecules are structurally similar to glycans on the surface of small intestine epithelial cells that act as receptors for microorganisms. One proposed mechanism for the antimicrobial effect of these soluble substances is direct binding with the potential pathogenic organisms.189., 190.

Globotriaosylceramide, another glycolipid in human milk, is the natural cell surface receptor for the toxin from Shigella dysenteriae and verotoxin released by enterohemorrhagic E. coli.191 The proposed mechanism of action of these glycolipids is that by binding to the toxin they form a stable complex that prevents the toxin from binding to the appropriate receptors on intestinal cells; however, Crane et al48 proposed from their studies that the oligosaccharide binds to the toxin receptor to block the action of the heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coli. Human milk gangliosides may be important in protecting infants against toxin-induced diarrhea, but this has not been specifically demonstrated in vivo in controlled trials.191., 207. Evidence exists that human milk glycans inhibit a broad range of pathogens (Table 5-5\n).188., 189., 190., 191., 192., 193.

They demonstrated that the concentrations of oligosaccharides were higher in the infants\u2019 feces than in mothers\u2019 milk and higher in feces than urine. The profile of oligosaccharides found in the infants was similar to that found in their mothers\u2019 milk. The formula-fed infants had lower concentrations of oligosaccharides and the profiles of the oligosaccharides were different from those found in the breastfed infants. The oligosaccharides remained intact passing through the intestine. A small percentage are absorbed and excreted intact in the urine. The oligosaccharides were available at these sites to block intestinal and urinary pathogens. Two other groups of researchers have documented variation of the composition of glycans in human milk over the first 4 months of lactation47 and variations in the composition of glycans in diverse populations.64 Therefore a diverse repertoire of glycans are present in large amounts in human milk, which persist intact in the intestine and reach the urine, and have demonstrated inhibitory effects on a variety of pathogens. These components constitute a major contribution of human milk to innate immunity at the level of an infant\u2019s gut. Other authors propose that the gangliosides GD3 and GM3 may play an immunomodulatory role early in lactation by affecting DCs decreasing the production of interleukins (IL-10 and IL-12) and suppressing the expression of various cluster designation (CD) markers and major histocompatability complex class II on DCs.26\n",

Specifically, this is accomplished by increasing antibody production, especially IgA; enhancing phagocytosis; activating T cells; and increasing \u03b11-antitrypsin production by mononuclear phagocytes. IL-7 is a chemokine known to improve thymic output in animals and appears related to the proliferation and survival of T cells in all stages of development.194 Ngom et al194 have described improved thymic function in exclusively breastfed infants associated with higher IL-7 concentrations in the mother\u2019s breast milk. The breast milk of Gambian mothers contained variable levels of IL-7, but the geometric mean levels were higher in the first 8 weeks postpartum in mothers whose infants were born in the \u201charvest-season\u201d (January to June) compared with those mothers whose infants were born in the \u201chungry-season.\u201d The authors postulate that IL-7 in breast milk enhances T cell proliferation and survival and overall thymic development in the infant, leading to long-term benefits in protection from infection.",

Goldman et al91 reported on the bioactivity and concentration of cytokines in breast milk from their own work and that of others (see Table 5-6). Srivastava et al254 obtained some conflicting results using different assays in colostrum, early milk, and mature milk. They confirmed the presence of M-CSF throughout lactation, as well as TGF-\u03b21 and -\u03b22, IL-1RA, GRO-\u03b1, MCP-1, RANTES, and IL-8, but reported insignificant amounts of GM-CSF, stem cell factor, LIF, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, sIL-2R, and IFN-\u03b1 (see Box 5-3 for nomenclature). Srivastava et al254 also used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure the production of cytokine mRNA by cells in breast milk. They reported the presence of mRNA for MCP-1, IL-8, TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, M-CSF, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, which may be another source of these cytokines in breast milk. Hawkes et al113 demonstrated that human milk cells from lactating women at 5 weeks postpartum are capable of active cytokine production in vitro (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) with and without exposure to lipopolysaccharide. Continued cytokine production by human milk cells is another explanation for the variable amounts of cytokines identified in breast milk and is further evidence that the cells are capable of responding to an infectious stimulus.",

That development must include the ability to respond to and protect against invasive pathogens at the same time as \u201ctolerate\u201d or \u201cignore\u201d the multitude on commensal organisms that reside at these surfaces.

The development of the mucosal immune system occurs in the prenatal period and continues in the postnatal period. The functional mucosal barrier includes the action of enzymes, chemicals, acidity or pH, mucus, immune globulins and indigenous flora. In as early as 8 weeks of gestational age, researchers have identified changes in the intestinal barrier with the development of enterocytes, goblet cells and enterochromaffin cells along with evidence of development of tight junctions between the epithelial cells.211., 222. Mucus production, which can block adherence of pathogens to epithelial cells, demonstrates both pre- and postnatal development beginning with evidence of expression of the muc2 gene as early as 12 weeks\u2019 gestational age.34 This is approximately the same time that Paneth cells appear in intestinal crypts. These cells secrete various products, including \u03b1-defensin, lysozyme, secretory phospholipase A2, and TNF-\u03b1, which contribute to protection from pathogens, stem cell protection within the epithelia layer and influence the selection and number of commensal organisms.180., 240. Secretory immune globulins sIgA and IgM act at the epithelial surface, largely without inflammation, by limiting adherence and transmigration and facilitating phagocytosis of potential pathogens.",

Overlying the isolated lymphoid follicles of the gut are specialized epithelial cells called M-cells. M-cells (membrane, microfold, or multifenestrated cells) come in direct contact with microorganisms and antigens due to a lack of a surface glycocalyx covering. These remarkable cells endocytose, phagocytose and transcytose molecules, and antigens from their luminal surface to their basal surface. Antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes process the trancytosed molecules, presenting them to submucosal aggregates of lymphocytes. The activated lymphocytes that have responded to the specific presented antigens migrate via the lymphatics to the thoracic duct and into the blood. These lymphocytes circulate in the blood, until they return to mucosal tissues, predominantly the same ones they originated from, where they now function as effector lymphocytes in the lamina propria. This process of \u201cdirected migration\u201d to specific sites occurs due to the influence of cytokines and adhesion molecules, such as chemokine CCL28 (mucosal epithelia chemokine) expressed in the colon and salivary glands and CCL25 (thymus-expressed chemokine) which effects the site-specific migration.217 The immune response of lymphocytes in the submucosa and the subsequent directed migration to the same and other mucosal sites produces a focused response to a selected repertoire of antigens at those sites. The lactating mammary gland is an essential component of MALT. A mother\u2019s mature effective immune response to microorganisms in her and her infant\u2019s environment through this antigenic stimulation of MALT in the mother\u2019s gut and respiratory mucosa and the directed migration of cells to the breast results in activated lymphocytes and antibodies in the breast milk providing protection to the infant against those microorganisms.

Immunoglobulin-producing intestinal plasma cells (primarily IgA-producing cells) in the lamina propria increase in number from 1 to 12 months of age.257 With normal maturation of the mucosal immune system, large numbers of immunoglobulin-producing cells locate in the intestinal lamina propria. The monomeric IgA produced by these plasma cells is transported through epithelial cells to the mucosal lumen. Attachment of an epithelial glycoprotein, the membrane secretory component to two IgA molecules leads to the formation of a dimeras; the sIgA molecule is \u201csecreted\u201d at the mucosal surface. IgM, in the form of a pentamer, contains a polypeptide J-chain and is transported by the same mechanism.25 A portion of the secretory component remains attached to the sIgA and IgM, which protects these molecules against proteolysis and contributes to their stability. Large amounts of sIgA and IgM are produced, in a similar fashion, by the mammary glands and delivered to the infant via breast milk.

Forchielli and Walker 69 have reviewed many of these immune mechanisms acting at the mucosal level. TLRs are transmembrane receptors (pattern recognition receptors) that are capable of detecting and discriminating among various groups of potential pathogens and initiate different immune responses to them. TLRs \u201crecognize\u201d pathogen-associated molecular patterns, conserved features in the pattern of molecules expressed by pathogens and commensal organisms. Specific TLRs recognize a particular repertoire of patterns: TLR2 identifies bacterial lipoproteins and peptidoglycan molecules; TLR3 recognizes double-stranded DNA and TLR4 identifies lipopolysaccharide. Ten TLRs are recognized in humans to date; some have identified legends (pathogen-associated molecular patterns from viruses, bacteria, and protozoa) to which they bind. TLRs are present on some epithelial cells, but are predominantly expressed on macrophages and DCs.228 Intestinal epithelial cells are influenced by gut flora and local immune response to express specific TLRs. The recognition of specific antigens by epithelial cell TLRs stimulates different intracellular signal pathways that lead to different T-lymphocyte immune responses. It has been postulated that the ongoing immune stimulation elicited by the microbial flora in the gut \u201cprograms\u201d the host to predominately express different T-helper cell responses: TH1-like, TH2-like and TH3-like. This is referred to as \u201ccrosstalk\u201d between the indigenous intestinal flora and the body\u2019s immune system. The TH1-like response is described as delayed-type hypersensitivity or cellular immunity; characterized by the predominant release of IL-2, IL-12 and interferon-\u03b3. The TH2-like is primarily humoral immunity, antibody production (especially IgE) associated with ILs: IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6. The TH3-like response is related to oral tolerance and antiinflammatory effects in association with the release of IL-10 and TGF-10. A theoretical \u201cideal\u201d for this system is the ability of the host to respond to various stimuli with balanced protection against the microbial invasion without excessive inflammation or damage to the host. An imbalanced (or poorly regulated) response of this system could result in an allergic reaction against food proteins (TH2 excess) or an autoimmune inflammatory response against self-antigens (TH1 excess).69\n",

Prebiotics are substances that (through different mechanisms) increase the growth and survival of probiotic bacteria within the host. Commonly recognized probiotic bacteria are Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacteria infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces boulardii, and Bifidobacteria bifidus.

Numerous additional factors directly influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota in early infancy, including gestational age, ingestion of breast milk or formula, initiation of solid foods, mode of delivery, the route of delivery of food, the time of onset of feeding, exposure to other microbes through contact (with family, animals, persons from other environments), antibiotics, and intercurrent or chronic illness.66., 215. The predominant flora of breastfed infants are Lactobacillus bifidus and Bifidobacterium spp., which constitute up to 95% of the culturable organisms. The remaining minority of bacteria include Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Micrococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli, and other uncommon organisms in small numbers.178., 186., 282.\nLactobacillus bifidus metabolizes milk saccharides, producing large amounts of acetic acid, lactic acid, and some formic and succinic acids, which create the low pH of the stool of breastfed infants. L. bifidus also produces short-chain fatty acids in the course of colonization. Large numbers of bifidobacteria can lower the pH of the intestine, which limits the growth of some pathogens such as E. coli, Bacteroides, and staphylococci. The flora of bifid bacteria is inhibitory to certain pathogenic bacteria. Substantial clinical evidence is available to demonstrate protection against intestinal infections from S.aureus, Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, E. coli, rotavirus, Campylobacter, and protozoa.81 Two facilitory actions of breast milk are apparent. The first encourages the growth of L. bifidus and thus crowds out the growth of other bacteria. In the second, the number of pathogens is also kept low by the direct action of lysozyme and lactoferrin. When the number of pathogenic bacteria is kept low, immune antibodies can keep the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria under control and limit the invasion of bacteria through the gut wall into the bloodstream.",

Their mothers had no detectable antibodies for strain 0111 in their milk, which would suggest that other factors in human milk protect the infant from serious illness when no antibodies are in the milk. Hanson106 also reported the results of another study in which after colonization with a specific strain of E. coli, mothers had large numbers of lymphoid cells in their milk with antibodies to that E. coli. The mothers\u2019 serum showed no such response. This supports the concept that antigen-triggered lymphoid cells from Peyer patches seek out lymphoid-rich tissue, producing IgA in the mammary gland. The mother is immunized in the gut at the same time as her milk. It has also been shown that E. coli enteritis can be cured by feeding human milk.",
