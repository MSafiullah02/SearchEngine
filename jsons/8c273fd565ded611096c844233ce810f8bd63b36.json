Using cryo-ultramicrotomy of cultured cells followed by indirect immunogold labelling, both enzymes appeared to be strongly and regularly labelled on the cell surfaces of human synovial fibroblasts, T-Iymphocytes and colon carcinoma cells Caco-2. In the cytoplasm of the synovial fibroblasts gold-labelled vesicle-like structures were found, which we consider to be potential transport vesicles. An abundant and regular expression of CD13 was detected on cultured renal parenchymal cells. On the renal carcinoma cell line Caki-l cells we found a low, non-homogeneous and clustered CD13-labelling. On cultured renal parenchymal cells and the Caki-l cells CD26 could not be observed. The expression pattern of CD26 on renal carcinoma cell line Caki-2 cells showed also a slightly clustered distribution. A low density CD26-labelling was present on the squamous cell carcinoma cell line UM-SCC-22B. CD13 was absent in Caki-2 and UM-SCC-22B cells. The presence of both enzymes on the cultured cells enables their ultrastructural investigation under different growth conditions and their involvement in cell-cell interactions. For this purpose, however, further investigations are necessary.",

The brush border membranes of renal tubular cells and small intestinal enterocytes contain an abundance of APN and DPP IV, which take part in the luminal hydrolysis of oligopeptides (McDonald and Barrett, 1986) . In alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes APN serves as a receptor for coronaviruses (Delmas et aI., 1992) . In several tissues APN and DPP IV modify the effects of bioactive peptides like enkephalins (APN), substance P and casomorphins (DPP IV) (De la Baume et aI., 1983; Gros et aI., 1985; McDonald and Barrett, 1986; Stein et aI., 1989; Nausch et aI., 1990) . In the immune system the enzymes take part in the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes (Mentlein et aI., 1984; Ashmun and Look, 1990; Bathon et aI., 1992) . DPP IV has a coreceptor function for HIV viruses (Callebaut et aI., 1993) .",

Nevertheless, many functions of APN and DPP IV, both under physiological and pathological conditions, are still unknown. In order to obtain further information about the role of these peptidases, it is necessary to find out their precise ultrastructural location (Gossrau, 1985) . Most of the papers published on this subject are based on light microscopical enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. However, with these techniques it is difficult to obtain information about the cellular expression pattern of peptidases. Electron microscopy seems to be best suited to localize macromolecules at the ultrastructural level (Bendayan et aI., 1987) . Until now electron microscopical techniques for ectopeptidase investigations have hardly been applied, which can be explained by methodological problems (Gossrau, 1993) .",

In our investigation, however, peptidase antigenicity was excellently preserved in spite of postfixation of the gelatine embedded cells.",

Using biochemical methods Bathon et aL (1992) described a three-to-one relation between CD13 and CD26. These results correspond to our findings. The CD13-labelled vesicles, seen near the cell surface in the cytoplasm, may be vesicles possibly transporting the membrane enzymes from the Golgi complex to the cell surface (Danielsen et aL, 1987) . In the Golgi complex no immunogold labelling was found. In proximal tubular cells from human kidney (DPP IV; Stange et aL, 1996) , proximal tubular cells from rat kidney (APN; Kettmann et aL, 1992b), rat small intestinal enterocytes (APN; Stange, 1996) , pig small intestinal enterocytes (APN; Hansen et aL, 1987) and in the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 (DPP IV; Klumperman et aL, 1991) the membrane peptidases could be labelled and have been discussed as potential transport vesicles. In the other cells no intracellular labelling was present. The intracellular labelling of the synovial fibroblasts is probably due to very strong cell surface labelling of CD13 followed by endocytotic uptake.",

These results are comparable, because they were obtained with the same methods. On the renal carcinoma cells Caki-1 and Caki-2, in each case only one of the two peptidases could be found with cryo-ultramicrotomy. These results coincide with our findings obtained by fluorescence analysis. In comparison with the cultured renal parenchymal cells and renal proximal tubular cells, from tissue sections (Kettmann et aL, 1992 b; Stange et aL, 1996) , CD13 is present both non-homogeneously and with lower labelling in Caki-1 cells, where the enzyme appears to form clusters. When CD26 on the cultured renal carcinoma cells Caki-2 is compared with renal proximal tubular cells in tissue sections (Kettmann et aL, 1992 a; Stange et aI., 1996) , a reduced expression is observed. There is also a slightly different clustered expression, which would probably be stronger with 6 nm instead of the applied 10 nm gold particles. Small gold particles (diameter less than 7 nm) label with the highest efficiency, because they penetrate the cryosections better leading to a higher labelling density (Van Bergen en Henegouwen and Leunissen, 1986) .",

These slight changes of the cell surfaces can only be detected by electron microscopical methods.
