Coronaviruses infect mammals and birds causing varied symptoms such as respiratory tract disease and diarrhea. In humans, coronavirus infections have been shown to be potentially lethal. This is the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.",

In the case of MERS, it is likely that the vaccine development was delayed because of the scarcity of suitable and cost-effective small animal models during pre-clinical experimentation. In addition, it is probable that a vaccine has not been delivered because of the low interest in investing in a vaccine for a disease that has produced relatively low and geographically centralized cases (compared with other more global and persistent infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV and tuberculosis). This last factor might have also contributed to the lack of a vaccine for SARS, in the sense that it was considered pointless to continue investing in a vaccine for a disease whose cases ceased to be reported in 2004.",

By these means, the animal models allowed systemic virus replication and the analysis of more severe and clinically relevant symptoms of the SARS and MERS diseases [31, 43, 68, 69, 76, 96]. For example, transgenic mice were created to express the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). This allowed the enhancement of infection sensitivity and the evaluation of protection from lethal doses of the virus [31]. Other approaches involved the use of mouse-adapted coronavirus strains that could replicate and induce health conditions that resemble human infection (e.g., severe pneumonia, viremia leading to death) [30\u201332, 47]. Transgenic mouse models for SARS and MERS are now commercially available.",

Neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that bind and neutralize virus infection of host cells [105]. Vaccinated animals and passive immunization approaches focusing on the MERS and SARS S glycoproteins induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies that correlated with protection [39, 43, 45, 49, 53, 106, 107]. Nevertheless, it is still in doubt whether adaptive T cell responses (another arm of the immune system) can also play a role in conferring protection, with few studies addressing this issue. As an example, a group of researchers demonstrated that specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell peptides against SARS-CoV could be exploited to provide protection in mice [37, 108, 109]. Another study pointed out that the protection against SARS-CoV in mice induced by a DNA vaccine was due only to antibody responses (depletion of CD4/CD8+ T cells and adoptive T cell transfer did not have an effect on protection) [45]. In MERS, vaccination efficacy in non-human primates has been correlated to the induction of CD8+ T cell responses (in addition to neutralizing antibodies) when using DNA-based vaccines [78]. It is then likely that protection induced by vaccination might be dependent on different factors such as the selected vaccination platform, antigens, animal models and routes of vaccination.",

Even though there seems to be little direct evidence proving this idea, vaccines based on these regions have already been tested, allowing the induction of high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a certain level of protection in small animals and non-human primates [49, 50, 56, 78].",

            "text": "The vaccine development efforts for coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS can help to direct the vaccine development efforts for COVID-19. The development of highly effective and safe vaccines for COVID-19 should consider aspects such as the possibility of ADE and other adverse effects previously observed with SARS and MERS. Even though these features have only been seen in some animal models and vaccination regimens, the possibility is still there to be considered for COVID-19. In addition, these vaccine development efforts should address the possibility of the short-term immunogenicity derived from neutralizing antibodies, as also previously observed for SARS and MERS-CoV after natural infection.",

            "text": "The possibility of exploiting T cell responses for coronavirus vaccination should also be considered (along with B cell responses). These responses have been shown to be persistent and protective in animal models. Furthermore, there is evidence of long-term persistence in humans. Strategies such as adjuvantation, tailoring of the S glycoprotein, different routes of vaccination and the use of unexplored vaccine platforms for enhancing immunogenicity and preventing potential undesired effects should also be considered. It is worth mentioning that employing the N protein of the coronavirus for vaccination could have several benefits. As previously mentioned, there is the potential of providing long-term cross-protection when employing this antigen. Of note, the evidence of short-term immunogenicity and protection in coronavirus-exposed individuals does not mean that an effective vaccine is not possible. Vaccines for other now eradicated diseases that lack naturally acquired immunity prove this point (e.g., smallpox). The emergence of COVID-19 should also serve for elevating our comprehension and expertise in the abatement of pathogenic microorganisms of global health importance.",

The MERS coronavirus S glycoprotein is used predominantly in vaccine development for coronaviruses. The S glycoprotein induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and the protein has been frequently exploited in subunit vaccination. In nature, the S glycoprotein binds to the host cell receptor DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein [62]. The S glycoprotein can be divided into two subunits, S1 and S2. The subunit S1 contains the RBD. The subunit S2 contains heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) that the virus uses for membrane fusion and entry to the host cell. The S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein, and it exists as a trimer, as depicted. DPP4 dipeptidyl peptidase 4, S1 S1 subunit of S, S2 S2 subunit of S, RBD receptor binding domain.
