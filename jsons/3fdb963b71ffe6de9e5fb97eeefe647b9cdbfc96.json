Our aim was to assess the capacity of SARI surveillance to collect mortality data and provide initial insights of the characteristics of SARI and influenza-confirmed deaths, rather than to accurately document the burden of influenza-associated mortality. We found that few countries that conduct influenza surveillance are systematically collecting data on outcomes of hospitalization, and available information on deaths is sparse and incomplete. Likewise, data on the presence of comorbidities were incomplete. We also found that pregnant women were underrepresented in SARI data from all countries. We found a wide range in CFPs for SARI and influenza across countries, which may reflect differences in case definitions, criteria for hospitalization, quality of hospital care, or quality of surveillance, including proper handling of biological specimens and ascertainment of deaths. Countries where deaths are reported from sites sporadically had lower CFPs than those that reported deaths systematically, suggesting that sporadic reporting may fail to capture a large number of SARI-associated deaths.

Despite the incomplete data, we were able to draw some important conclusions. First, in-hospital respiratory mortality and influenza-associated mortality occur predominantly in very young individuals and those 18-49 years.

Some but not all of this difference may be explained by population demographic characteristics in Africa; >40% of the population of Africa in 2013 is <15 years of age, and just 3.4% are aged \u226565 years [24] . There may be differences in access to care among elderly persons in Africa that result in fewer elderly individuals with respiratory illness being hospitalized. Our analysis demonstrates that elderly persons who are hospitalized have a greater risk of death from respiratory disease, especially influenza, than young children. A systematic review of the case-fatality risk from the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic found significant variation in risk by age group, ranging from approximately 1 death per 100 000 symptomatic cases in children aged 0-19 years to approximately 1000 deaths per 100 000 symptomatic cases in persons aged \u226565 years [25] . These estimates support our finding of an increased CFP among hospitalized elderly individuals, although only 15.8% of the influenza-associated deaths reported here involved influenza A(H1N1) infections (Table 1) . Despite this, children aged 0-4 years accounted for over one third of all SARI-associated deaths and one-third of influenza-associated deaths due to SARI in this analysis, a finding consistent with prior studies in low-income settings [3, 26] . Likewise, adults aged 18-49 years accounted for over one third of all SARIassociated deaths and one third of influenza-associated deaths due to SARI, which may be explained by the high prevalence of HIV in this age group. In this analysis, HIV status was not reported for nearly half of enrolled SARI-associated deaths. Despite this limitation, these data clearly demonstrate that HIV infection is common among SARI-associated hospitalizations and deaths with and without influenza virus coinfection; however, we are unable to demonstrate a statistical association of HIV infection with death among hospitalized SARI cases. Our coauthors from South Africa have found that HIV-infected patients with influenza were 4 times more likely (95% CI, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] to die than HIV-uninfected patients with influenza [2] .

Because almost 90% of all deaths were reported from Kenya and South Africa, our findings may not be representative. In South Africa, a country with systematic reporting and a relatively high CFP in this analysis, retrospective review of respiratory deaths in sentinel hospitals found that as many as 1 in 3 respiratory deaths were not enrolled in SARI surveillance [27] . Some countries in our study reported very few or no SARI-associated deaths, which limits confidence in conclusions drawn from these data. Also, substantial differences existed in how SARI, HIV status, M. tuberculosis coinfection, and other underlying medical conditions were diagnosed or defined for surveillance purposes. It is likely that very severely ill patients would not have been enrolled into surveillance, especially if informed consent was required, as was the case in several countries. This may explain why 149 of 1222 reported deaths (12%) did not have influenza virus test results. Another limitation is the ability to attribute death to any one pathogen. Although influenza viruses are less commonly found in asymptomatic persons, other viruses, such as rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, are frequently isolated from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens in asymptomatic persons, especially children [28] [29] [30] [31] . The relative contribution of these pathogens to mortality may also be affected. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens may not be the ideal specimens for detecting some respiratory pathogens [32] . Also, the methods of testing for some non-influenza virus pathogens differed by site. For example, South Africa diagnosed S. pneumoniae infection on the basis of lytA PCR of blood samples, while Kenya used blood cultures to diagnose invasive S. pneumoniae infection.

Because of the logistics of specimen collection, transport, and analysis, many countries are only able to support a small number of sites, which may not be representative of the population. Limited access to care in many African settings may further reduce the number of persons hospitalized with respiratory infections, including influenza. Many cases of SARI may be due to secondary complications such as bacterial pneumonia after initial influenza virus infection, when influenza virus shedding has decreased or ceased. Moreover, influenza-associated deaths with a nonrespiratory presentation, including heart attack and stroke, are unlikely to be tested for influenza virus even if hospitalized. Many complications of influenza, especially postinfluenza pneumonia and death, happen >1 week after initial infection [33, 34] and therefore may occur at home after discharge. Vital registration data in South Africa indicate that as many as 50% of respiratory disease-associated deaths occur outside of hospitals [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 994, "end": 997, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1188, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Because of these limitations many countries have used other methods to estimate influenza-associated mortality. Some sites have conducted thorough community-based mortality reviews in which persons meeting the case definition of influenzaassociated death are counted in a defined population [36, 37] . Excess mortality modeling is commonly used to assess deaths due to influenza in populations with accurate vital statistics or International Classification of Diseases-coded hospitalization data, with or without adjustment for influenza virus circulation [6, 38, 39] ; however, few countries in Africa have complete vital registration data, and many countries do not experience clear seasonal peaks in influenza transmission, which may limit the utility of such methods. Many countries in Africa have health and demographic surveillance sites where all births and deaths are recorded and where deaths are assessed by verbal autopsy. It is possible that an assessment of trends in mortality at these sites, combined with virological data on influenza virus circulation patterns, may provide more-accurate estimates of influenza-associated deaths when vital statistics are not available.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 295, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 296, "end": 299, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 556, "end": 559, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 560, "end": 563, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 564, "end": 567, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, stronger surveillance for respiratory deaths may help to identify risk groups for targeted vaccine use and other prevention strategies. Among those tested, respiratory viruses other than influenza virus and S. pneumoniae were commonly identified in SARI-associated deaths of all ages; however, nasopharyngeal carriage may overestimate mortality from some of these pathogens. Surveillance in antenatal clinics and/or maternity wards should be strengthened to better capture pregnant women, given the WHO's recent decision to prioritize them for influenza vaccination [40] . Sentinel surveillance may provide some information on characteristics of influenza-associated deaths but will likely underestimate influenza-associated mortality.
