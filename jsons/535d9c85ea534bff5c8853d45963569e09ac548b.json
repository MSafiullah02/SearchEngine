ARBs and/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and 30 major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to 31 two years before infection.

Observing that human pathogenic coronaviruses bind their target cells through angiotensin-55 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [5] , and that the expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in diabetics and 56 patients who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) [5, 6], Fang 57 and colleagues hypothesized that the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with Severe 58 Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus the hypertension treatment with ACE2-59 stimulating drugs, as well as ACE2 polymorphisms, might increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 60 [7] . Consequently, this would lead to a serious conflict regarding treatment, because ACE2 reduces 61 inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, 62 diabetes, and hypertension [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .

Four models were built, two were restricted to hypertensive subjects (A and B), 104 and two included the total sample (Models C and D) and. Models A and C were fit to predict severe or very 105 severe disease (grouped together), while Models B and D to predict very severe/lethal disease only (and 106 repeated to predict death, with similar results, which have not been shown to avoid redundancy). All 107 recorded variables were included a priori in all models, with the exception of treatments with ACE inhibitors 108 and ARBs, that were excluded from Models C and D because of multicollinearity with hypertension.",

On the opposite side, other scientists suggested that, other than being harmful, ARBs 175 and ACE inhibitors use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and known or suspected COVID-19 may 176 even exert a beneficial effect, as ACE2 up-regulation could increase the conversion of Angiotensin II to 177 Angiotensin-(1-7), a peptide with potentially protective anti-inflammatory properties [20, 21]. 178 Recently, three large observational studies based upon inpatient only [14] or in-and outpatient electronic 179 health records [15, 16] examined the association between antihypertensive medications and the risk of 180 COVID-19 and/or a severe/lethal disease: our results substantially confirm these previous findings and, 181 concordantly, no increased risk emerged with ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs use. Of note, Mehra et al [14], 182 after controlling for age, gender, current smoke and comorbidities, found similar death rates among COVID-183 19 patients using ARBs, and even lower death rates among ACE inhibitors users. The latter results, however 184 -although in line with a previous observational analysis on Chinese in-hospital COVID-19 subjects [12], are 185 based upon hospitalized patients only, may be due to unmeasured confounding and, in the absence of 186 randomized evidence, should be considered only preliminary [23].",
