Therefore, we investigated if ACE2 expression correlates with permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-mediated infection. To this end, total RNA from a panel of cell lines of known permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-driven infection was isolated, reverse transcribed, and the ACE2 sequence was amplified by nested PCR (Fig. 1A\n). As a control, the GAPDH cDNA was also amplified. In a first round of PCR employing outer primers, GAPDH expression was readily detected in cDNA from all cell lines tested, whereas no signal for ACE2 was observed. In a second round of PCR with inner primers specific for ACE2, amplificates were obtained using cDNA from Huh-7, Hep-2, Vero E6, and 293T cells, which are susceptible to S-driven infection [1], [2], [9], [10]. In contrast, ACE2 sequences were not amplified from cDNA derived from HeLa, HOS, C8166, BL41, and NIH3T3 cell lines, which are largely refractory to S-mediated infection [9], [10], [11]. Thus, ACE2 expression in cell lines correlates with susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, indicating that ACE2 plays an important role in SARS-CoV replication.",

We anticipated that pre-incubation of virions with soluble ACE2 might block binding of SARS-CoV S to membrane bound ACE2, since it has been shown that soluble ACE2 blocks the attachment of a S-immunoglobulin fusion protein to permissive Vero E6 cells [15]. Alternatively, pre-coating of virions with soluble receptor could activate the fusogenic activity in SARS-CoV S and facilitate infection of target cells. To obtain soluble ACE2, a stop codon was introduced at position 740 of the ACE2 coding sequence, resulting in a truncated reading frame encoding the entire ectodomain as previously described [21]. Transfection of 293T cells with the plasmid encoding soluble ACE2 resulted in efficient release of the protein into the supernatant, while no soluble protein was detected in supernatants of cells transfected with wild type ACE2 (Fig. 2A\n). The supernatant containing soluble ACE2 was concentrated by filtration through an ultrafilter with a 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off (CentriconPLUS80) and employed for inhibition studies (Fig. 2B). Viral pseudotypes bearing SARS-CoV S or VSV-G were standardized for comparable production of luciferase upon infection of target cells, incubated with the indicated dilutions of supernatant containing soluble ACE2, and used for infection of 293T cells. The soluble ACE2 containing supernatant blocked SARS-CoV S-driven infection in a dose-dependent manner, but did not appreciably modulate VSV-G- and MLV-glycoprotein-mediated infection (Fig. 2B and data not shown), indicating that the ACE2 ectodomain and possibly portions thereof can be used to specifically block SARS-CoV S-driven infection.",

The largest deletion removed the kinase consensus sites and reduced the tail length from 42 to 9 amino acids (Fig. 3A\n). All ACE2 variants were expressed to comparable degrees on the surface and in lysates of transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3B) and efficiently enhanced S-driven infection (Fig. 3C), indicating that amino acids 771\u2013805 in the ACE2 cytoplasmic tail are dispensable for enhancement of SARS-CoV S-mediated infection of 293T cells.",

Thus, the development of compounds that block binding of SARS-CoV S to ACE2 without inhibiting the natural function of ACE2 is now a desirable goal. For these strategies to be successful, however, it needs to be determined if ACE2 is the only receptor for SARS-CoV. This is especially important in the light of recent findings demonstrating that SARS-CoV cell tropism is broader than initially appreciated [9], [10]. Here, we analyzed several cell lines of known permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-mediated infection for expression of ACE2 messenger RNA (mRNA). Expression of ACE2 mRNA correlated with permissiveness to infection for all cell lines examined, indicating that ACE2 plays a central role in SARS-CoV infection. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that alternative receptors promote viral entry into certain cell types and tissues.",

For example, a tetrameric form of the HIV receptor CD4 potently abrogates HIV-1 infection, and this effect is recapitulated to some degree by a 27 amino acid comprising CD4 mimicking synthetic peptide [22], [23]. In our hands, the soluble ACE2 ectodomain specifically blocked infection by SARS-CoV S-bearing pseudotypes. This validates the receptor-binding site in S as a therapeutic target, although the development of therapeutics based on the ACE2 ectodomain is going to be challenging. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to examine if smaller portions of the ACE2 ectodomain exhibit inhibitory activity. Finally, the solution of the structure of S bound to ACE2 must provide the basis for the rational design of compounds that target residues in S contacted by ACE2.",

Indeed, the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 contains consensus sites for kinases, suggesting an interaction of this domain with cellular proteins involved in signal transduction. Moreover, the ACE2 cytoplasmic domain could be involved in internalization, which seems to be required for S-driven infection [9], [10]. However, large deletions in the ACE2 cytoplasmic tail did not appreciably modulate expression and receptor function, at least in the context of 293T cells over-expressing receptor (Fig. 3C). These data argue against an important role of the ACE2 cytoplasmic domain in mediating SARS-CoV S-driven infection, albeit different cellular backgrounds need to be examined. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that the minimal sequences still remaining in the cytoplasmic tail of the ACE2 deletion-variants examined play a role in signaling or internalization. However, the introduction of larger deletions abrogated surface but not intracellular expression (data not shown) of the receptor, suggesting that sequences between amino acids 766 and 771 are required for the insertion of ACE2 into the plasma membrane.",
