            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe presentation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), were the diseases induced by many extreme conditions including severe bacterial pneumonia, severe sepsis, trauma and burn [8], [9], [10]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and avian influenza A H5N1 viral infection of the lung has resulted in high mortality among humans because of the complication of ARDS [11], [12], [13]. Our previous work indicated that swine influenza A H9N2 viral infection has resulted in ALI [14]. Therefore, infectious factors, most of which are viruses, have become one of the most important causes of ALI in humans. The pathophysiological mechanism of ALI is believed to be associated with the uncontrolled inflammatory response in the lungs [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Meanwhile, studies found that the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) played a pivotal role on ALI [15]. TLR4 mediates many forms of ALI, such as ventilator-induced ALI and hemorrhagic shock-induced ALI [16], [17]. Once TLR4 binds with its ligands, it further activates NF-kB through a MyD88-dependent pathway that ultimately stimulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 leading to pathological changes in ALI [18], [19]. Also, NAC is a known antioxidant and antioxidants were already shown to interfere with influenza A virus replication and virus-induced proinflammatory responses [20], [21], [22].",

These data indicate that suppression of cytokine/chemokine expression alone is not sufficient to improve disease outcome. Oxygen free radicals (OFRs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI [42]. In unchallenged physiological states, production and scavenging of OFRs maintain their homeostasis. In disease states, however, OFRs may be generated in quantities sufficient to overwhelm antioxidant enzyme systems such as SOD. Over production can lead to various forms of cell damage and death [43] and may aggravate the development of disease [44]. In this study, we found that the concentrations of MDA were significantly higher in the lungs of mice with H9N2 swine influenza virus infection than those in the mice in the control group, but SOD activity in the mice with swine influenza virus infection was significantly lower than that in the mice in the control group. These results suggest that increased MDA levels should be correlated with the reduction in SOD activity in H9N2 swine influenza virus-infected mice, and we deduced that OFRs may be involved in the pathogenesis of H9N2 swine influenza virus-induced pneumonia.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor (TLR), a receptor protein found on the surface of animal cells, plays a critical role in the innate immune system. When microbes invade the host, TLR recognizes the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoprotein, flagellin of the flagellum, and double-stranded viral RNA (e.g., H9N2 influenza). While ssRNA viruses are known to recognize by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 [45], dsRNA viruses recognize TLR3 [46]. Detection of PAMPs by TLR proteins activates immune cell responses. Imai et al. identified that induction of ALI, induced by acid aspiration and infection by respiratory viruses and bacteria, was mediated by a common signaling pathway: NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species generated oxidized host phospholipids, e.g., oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphaticylcholine (OxPAPC), that, in turn, potently stimulated TLR4. They proposed that the ensuing cytokine storm, and in particular, IL-6, mediated ALI [47]. Other studies help confirm that TLR4 has been well documented as a pattern recognition receptor in acute infection-induced lung injury [48], [49], and TLR4 signaling is actively involved in the pathogenesis of noninfectious lung injury [50], [51]. TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected from lethality caused by mouse-adapted influenza virus [52]. Imai Y et al. identified TLR4 as a key pathway that controls the severity of ALI induced H5N1 avian influenza virus [47]. The finding of Shirley et al. that the TLR4 antagonist, Eritoran, is highly protective when administered therapeutically to mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza [53], let us to know that blocking TLR4 therapeutically would protect against influenza infection. Herein, we hypothesize that NAC antiviral activity against H9N2 virus results from its ability to inhibit activation of TLR4 pathways. However, previous studies have reported that NAC is unable to alter the course of a fatal influenza pneumonia caused by inoculation of a murinized swine H1N1 influenza virus [54]. Surprisingly, our present study shows that NAC's protective effect against H9N2 virus-induced lung injury results from its ability to inhibit the activation of TLR4 pathways. In animal studies, proinflammatory cytokines as well as TLR4 protein and mRNA increased significantly after H9N2 swine influenza virus infection, and the lung tissue had clear pathological changes. In addition, similar to the TLR4 inhibitor E5564, after treatment NAC, rats exhibited reduced lung injury as well as levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung tissue. Moreover, similar to the TLR4 inhibitor E5564, NAC treatment also result in the inhibition of mRNA and protein expression of TLR4.",
