The rate of positive results in the children without a respiratory illness was 35% 21. However, this problem may be less relevant in immunocompromised patients. In one study of adult lung transplant recipients, the false\u2010positive rate of PCR assays for viral pathogens was only 4% in the patients with no respiratory symptoms compared with 55% in the patients with a respiratory tract infection.
