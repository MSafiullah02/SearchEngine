Instead of a negative pressure in the isolation room, the outside corridor pressure will be at a positive pressure of 10 Pa.

(b) View from inside the room of the situation illustrated in (a), showing a three-dimensional view of possible airflow trajectories induced by the movement of the door opening into a hypothetical isolation room. The red (dark) face represents a person entering the room, through the doorway, who may be exposed to infectious air. (c) Same view from inside the room as illustrated in (b), but this time showing the possible airflow trajectories taking into account the temperature and density differences between cooler air outside (in the corridor) and warmer air inside a hypothetical isolation room. At the doorway itself, differences in air temperature and density with height are marked by the faces: red (dark) face, head height; blue (light) face, just above the floor.",
