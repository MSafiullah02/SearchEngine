In parallel to these, modern large-scale industrial software engineering processes require thorough configuration and model governance to provide the promised productivity gains. As an answer to the above challenge, MegaM@Rt2 provides a scalable mega-modelling approach to manage all the involved artifacts including the multitude of different types of models, corresponding workflows, and configurations, among others. In this context, an important challenge is to better tackle large diversity of models in terms of nature, number, size, and complexity. (Fig. 1) , the project proposes to integrate various system modelling artifacts on the System engineering level, while the runtime artifacts such as tests and on-line monitors produce traces that have to be analysed and linked with system artifacts for validation and remediation purposes. Consequently the project provides numerous tools that are categorised in those above-mentioned areas: a) system engineering, b) runtime analysis, and c) traceability management. The end users, industrial case studies, select a subset of the MegaM@Rt2 tools based on their preferred methodologies and technical areas. For example in the railway domain, engineers follow V-life cycle and focus on safety with specific modelling and verification techniques. They benefit from the large variety of the analysis tools that are enabled with the common traceability mechanisms.",

Besides, the MegM@Rt2 toolset packaging and delivery approach is based on common Eclipse packaging and delivery mechanisms: i) a public MegaM@Rt2 Eclipse update site [5] that users can apply to select and install the MegaM@Rt2 tools, and ii) the MegaM@Rt2 IDE (including tools and dependencies) has been published in the Eclipse Marketplace [6] , from where users can install it.

The system requirements are analysed to derive the system architecture and then they are formalised, deriving the \"assumption/guarantee\" pairs, using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), to compose contracts. Contracts are associated with system architectural components. CHESS is seamlessly integrated with the OCRA tool [11] supporting the analysis of the components behavior (expressed as a set of finite state machines) with respect to the associated contracts, to assess the formal correctness of the architecture.",

            "text": "Development of complex CPSs is a challenging activity requiring a combination of many tools. Open source tools for model-based system engineering have gained certain popularity. However, there is still a challenge to combine them into a practical tool chain that would address specific application domain needs. The tool chain should ensure interplay of diverse tools, as well as a transversal traceability for model artifacts. This is especially challenging in the modern context when the runtime analysis of target systems should be analysed with the help of system engineering models for verification and validation. The MegaM@Rt2 project focuses on providing tool sets that deal with model-based system engineering, runtime analysis, and traceability management. MegaM@Rt2 consortium is an active contributor to open source and has extensively applied open source tools within 8 diverse industrial case studies. In this paper, we have presented the overall concept of MegaM@Rt2, we have given indications on open source tools provided for various engineering areas and on the approaches for distribution of a large bundle of open source tools, and, finally, we have illustrated the benefits of our approach with a practical industrial case study example. We believe that this paper is valuable for the community of the CPS developers looking for an operational open source tool set for their purposes.",
