            "text": "24 logical chronic diseases by causing or worsening concomitant anxiety 25 and depression, hampering the contacts with physicians, and leading 26 to shortages or erratic supply of medicines. 27 With about 50 million people affected worldwide, epilepsy is one of 28 the most common neurological diseases globally and an important 29 cause of disability and mortality [1] deeply affecting quality of life and 30 social aspects such as driving or work, requiring long-term manage-31 ment. Although current antiseizure medications can effectively control 32 seizures in the majority of patients, one-third of them continue 33 experiencing seizures (drug-resistant epilepsy). Regular outpatient 34 consultations are therefore important for optimizing antiseizure ther-35 apy, managing epilepsy-related behavioral or psychological problems, 36 treating concomitant neurological disorders, conveying psychological 37 support, counseling on family planning, and releasing certifications for 38 driving license or fitness for work. All these activities can be severely 39 hampered by the containment measures established to face the pan-40 demic. The rearrangement of the healthcare systems has inevitably pri-41 oritized the management of patients with COVID-19 infection, reducing 42 the hospital access of patients with other chronic disorders (including 43 those with epilepsy), postponing, rescheduling, or even canceling ap-44 pointments and examinations. Furthermore, the industrial lockdown 45 can lead to reduced supplies of antiseizure medications. 46 Telemedicine services can prove extremely useful in supporting remote healthcare in persons with epilepsy during the current COVID-48 19 pandemic, particularly for their role in facilitating the interactive ex-49 change of information between patients and physicians [2]. Telemedi-50 cine is not inferior to traditional face-to-face visits with regard to 51 seizure control, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or medication 52 adherence [3,4]. 53 The use of smartphones applications can greatly facilitate the com-54 munication and the sharing of information between patients, their fam-55 ilies, and the caring physicians [5]. Instant messaging through 56 WhatsApp, social media (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook), or the 57 traditional short message service (SMS) allows patients to rapidly and 58 directly contact their physicians, asking urgent questions and exchang-59 ing information. However, these interaction systems require the avail-60 ability and the consent of the treating physician to be contacted or 61 involved in social media. This carries the risk of ethical issues, including 62 setting and maintaining boundaries in the patient-doctor relationship 63 and securing and sharing patient information on social media or on per-64 sonal online communication, preserving medical confidentiality [6]. 65 Although they cannot fully substitute traditional face-to-face visits, 66 video teleconferencing provides the opportunity for maintaining the 67 patient-doctor relationship, addressing urgent questions, advising on 68 drug-related adverse effects, and conveying other general information 69 for the epilepsy management [7]. Video teleconferencing allows com-70 munication and interaction through audio and video but obviously de-71 pends on a certain amount of technological knowledge and expertise 72 and the availability of a personal computer or an electronic device to in-73 stall the teleconferencing platform/software. Patients or caregivers with 74 cognitive impairment, limited education, or low economic resources 75 can hence find it difficult to easily and effectively access this technology. 76 Furthermore, the efficient implementation of this telemedicine service 77 to deliver consultations to improve the remote management of epilepsy 78 relies on the availability of high-speed connection and webcam/micro-79 phone quality and on a stable and widespread internet connection.",
