            "text": "The Philosophy of No -1940 In the last few decades of the 20 th century, there was a change from a biology that was relatively poor in data to a biology that was overflowing with information. This sudden avalanche was triggered mainly by technological advances that were used profitably in the structural and functional study of genomes and proteomes. The need to organize these data in such a way as to draw from them an explanatory coherence has become an imperative that requires high-performance computing facilities. After the decoding of dozens of genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, particularly that of Man, the first post-genomic era is currently opening up to a questioning of the use of knowledge that has been acquired. Man's health is at the heart of these preoccupations. Under pressure from the media and from a strong political current that leads to financial support being given to applications of so-called \"high-visibility\" fundamental research, society waits impatiently for quick, usable results, particularly in medicine. This can lead to a few paradoxical situations. Being subject to a mandatory finality in the short term, the experimental process comes into contradiction with academic research that is carried out over the long term, and is on the lookout for those contradictions that have often been and often remain at the origin of breathtaking findings. The interest of the pharmamade about living beings, with the necessity of making investments cost-effective and standing out from the competition, is contributing to a new image of biological research. Links that have been forged with the economic, social and political domains tend, nowadays, to have a preponderant affect on the application of the experimental method to living beings. One of the important parameters that has helped to modify the landscape of traditional biological research is related to the 241 ceutical and agronomic industries in the economic development of discoveries",

Another aspect of modern times is that, with the irresistible trend in genetic manipulation towards a focus on human beings, certain areas of fundamental research are finding themselves locked into philosophical dilemmas that are matter for ethical and sociocultural consideration, and the subjects of fierce debate.",

The facilities that are called into play include instruments that are often sophisticated, the performance of which, in terms of miniaturization, computerization and robotization, is far beyond that of apparatus that was in use a few decades ago. These facilities, applied to research into living beings, have entered the framework of a methodology that has been given the label biotechnology. Proceeding handin-hand with applications that have become more and more meaningful in the domains of medicine, pharmacology, agronomy and animal husbandry, the biotechnological process has come to the fore as a new paradigm for the experimental method as applied to living beings. In addition to new discoveries, the driving forces behind biotechnologies are related to economic imperatives as well as the interest and support they receive from the political powers-that-be. The academic spirit that presides over fundamental science gives way to the entrepreneurial spirit that implements a rational programming of facilities and an efficient organization of scientific collaborations. As an example, the sequencing of the human genome, which includes three billion nucleotide base pairs, required the coordination of several dozen scientific teams around the world and the matching of several tens of thousands of results.",

An overall conclusion then came to the fore. DNA is a polydeoxyribonucleotide that carries four cyclic bases, adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine. Each base is involved in the structure of a mononucleotide where it is itself associated with a sugar, deoxyribose, which is associated with a phosphate residue. DNA was compared to a ladder, the rungs of which (mononucleotides) were linked by ester bonds between an acid group of a phosphate residue of a nucleotide and the free hydroxyl group of the deoxyribose of the following nucleotide.",

Based on the pairing of A/T and C/G bases, the model of the double helix structure of DNA, formulated in 1953 by James WATSON and Francis CRICK, made it possible to understand the identical synthesis of double strands of DNA by replication during cell division (Figure IV.1 ) and, as a consequence, the conservation of hereditary characteristics in descendants. Afterwards, it was found that the information contained in the DNA base sequence determines the amino acid sequence in proteins. Then the roles played by messenger RNA and transfer RNAs were elucidated, the former acting as a carrier of information between DNA and the proteins being synthesized and the latter acting as double-headed adaptors, able to recognize nucleotide triplets (codons) in messenger RNA and to specifically fix amino acids in order to position them on the ribosomes, the final result being the synthesis of a protein chain. In 1966, the genetic code was deciphered. The veil of mystery that had covered the mechanism of the synthesis of proteins was lifted, and the decisive role played by nucleic acids in this synthesis was shown.",

Although, in bacteria, proteins are coded for by a continuous sequence of nucleotide triplets in DNA, in the 1970s the surprising discovery was made that in eukaryotic organisms, genes are discontinuous and made up of coding DNA sequences (exons) interrupted by non-coding sequences (introns). From the end of the 1950s, Fran\u00e7ois JACOB and Jacques MONOD had postulated the existence of a dual determinism for protein synthesis and shown that, next to structural genes expressed as proteins, there are regulatory genes able to control the expression of the structural genes. The importance of the differential regulation of gene expression in cell differentiation in higher organisms was quickly recognized. From this point on it was possible to explain why a particular species of protein is more specifically expressed in a given tissue and another species of protein is more particularly expressed in another tissue, each type of tissue finding its specificity in its molecular components. This fantastic framework of knowledge, which was built up over a couple of decades, has been used as the foundation stone for the so-called central dogma of molecular biology, which explains the transcription of DNA sequences into messenger RNAs and the translation of messenger RNAs into proteins and which, with only a few variants, is the same throughout the living world (Figure IV.1) 1 . 1 The fascinating history of molecular biology was well described by James D.

In 1962, in Geneva, Werner ARBER (b. 1929) 3 and Daisy DUSSOIX highlighted the restriction phenomenon, which involves the degradation of bacteriophage DNA by a recipient bacterium. They discovered that an extract of E. coli has a restriction activity, and that this activity is of an enzymatic nature, caused by a nuclease that breaks the phosphodiester bonds in DNA. In 1970, the Americans Hamilton SMITH (b. 1931) and Kent WILCOX 4 purified the first restriction enzyme from a strain of Haemophilus influenzae. In 1971 , Daniel NATHANS (1928 -1999 and Kathleen DANNA 5 (b. 1945) at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore (USA) drew up the first restriction map based on the circular DNA of the monkey SV40 virus, using a restriction enzyme that was named HindIII and a follow-up of the sequential appearance of shorter and shorter fragments resulting from the partial digestion of DNA. In the following years, dozens of restriction enzymes were isolated, all of them endowed with a surprising specificity with respect to specific base sequences in DNA ( Figure IV .2).

The enzyme responsible, reverse transcriptase, was purified by both H. TEMIN and David BALTIMORE (b. 1938) 7 . Starting with a determined messenger RNA, it then became possible to work back to the DNA, i.e., to the gene, by a simple enzymatic reverse transcription operation. DNA that has been synthesized in this way is called complementary DNA (cDNA). In eukaryotic organisms, reverse transcription has proved to be all the more useful as a technique in that all cDNA is coding, unlike the situation in vivo in which the genes are divided up into portions that are coding (exons) and portions that are non-coding (introns).",

In 1975, around a hundred molecular biologists gathered together at the Asilomar Conference Center 8 near Monterey in California, in order to discuss the dangers of the new DNA technology.

Fairly soon, yeast was substituted for this bacterium because, as a eukaryotic organism, it has enzyme systems that are able to carry out chemical finishing operations on neosynthesized proteins that bacteria are unable to do, for example the formation of disulfide bridges in insulin. Genetic recombination is used in order to cause bacteria to manufacture a foreign protein of animal or plant origin. This involves the insertion of the fragment of animal or plant DNA that codes for this foreign protein into a plasmid. The plasmid, a small ring of bacterial DNA, acts as a vector for the foreign DNA. In order to carry out insertion, plasmid DNA is cleaved by an appropriate restriction enzyme. The foreign DNA is obtained by reverse transcription from a useful messenger RNA. Its duplication is catalyzed by a DNA polymerase. The S1 nuclease makes it possible to break the covalent bond between two strands of DNA. In the following step, a terminal transferase is used to add four nucleotides for which the base is a cytosine (C) to each of the two DNA strands. The same lengthening operation is carried out on the bacterial plasmid, but, in this case, the addition involves a sequence of four nucleotides for which the base is a guanine (G) (complementary to the cytosine C). The bacterial plasmid is hybridized in vitro with foreign animal or plant DNA and then introduced into the bacterium which, using its own machinery, perfects the junction between the integrated DNA and the plasmid DNA.",

The swelling of the cells at the moment of injection can be seen (inset). Supported by these successes, genetic engineering started to come to the fore as an application-oriented discipline. Levels of performance that would never have been imagined half a century before were achieved, such as the production of growth hormone, interferons, blood coagulation factors and vaccines. In the final decades of the 20 th century, phenotype transformations using genetic modifications that had previously been carried out in bacteria and yeasts were successfully attempted in animals and plants. It was observed that a mutated DNA integrated into a plasmid and introduced into a fertilized mouse egg (by micromanipulation) modifies the mouse's genetic inheritance, which affects first the embryo and then the adult mouse with phenotype modifications. Such mice, which are said to be transgenic because of the stable integration of a foreign DNA into their genome, are now widely used as animal models in studies that aim to understand the mechanisms involved in high-incidence human pathologies such as cancer, diabetes, and rheumatoid conditions. In 1982, two American researchers 16 , Ralph BRINSTER (b. 1932) and Richard PALMITER (b. 1942) carried out a spectacular transgenesis experiment in mice. Using microinjection, they introduced the growth hormone gene (obtained from the rat) into oocytes of mice from a \"little\" germ line. Once the transgeneic mice had reached adulthood, they were giants. At present, the transgenesis technique is being applied both to the animal kingdom and to the plant kingdom. In the 1980s, Kary MULLIS 17 (b. 1944) perfected an ingenious technique, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), which makes it possible to produce several tens of thousands of copies of a fragment of DNA. Using this technique, it is possible to detect traces of a fragment of DNA of a given sequence down to an attomolar concentration, i.e., one billion billion (10 -18 ) times smaller than molar concentration.",

It has highlighted evolutive processes in the phylogenesis of proteins and linked these processes to precise functions. It has been possible to deduce that, over time, different families of proteins with similar functions appeared independently and evolved along different routes. This is the case for membrane proteins whose polypeptide chain crosses the thickness of the membrane six or twelve times; thus, the mitochondrial membrane proteins that transport metabolites are formed by triplication of an element with two transmembrane segments, while proteins located in other membranes of the cell are derived from duplication of an element with three transmembrane segments.

Thus, around a hundred short DNA strands, corresponding to portions of genes of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, commonly known as mouse-ear cress, a small plant in the brassicaceae (formerly cruciferae) family, are synthesized. A robot is used to deposit microquantities of these DNAs in solution in a dot pattern on a small glass slide coated with poly-L-lysine, thus comprising a \"chip\" on which the covalently fixed DNAs act as probes for specific molecules. A later step involves both the use of reverse transcription to produce complementary DNAs (cDNAs) from messenger RNAs arising from the expression of genes in the same plant and the labeling of these cDNAs with fluorescent ligands for use in screening. Once these fluorescent cDNAs have been denatured, i.e., after separation into single strands, they are brought into contact with the DNA chip. The unhybridized molecules are removed by washing. ",

This is the case for protein kinases that catalyze, via ATP, the phosphorylation of endocellular proteins, of proteases involved in hydrolysis reactions, or even of cell surface receptors that are able to combine with ligands such as hormones. The use of automated crystallization systems has become common in structural biology. From the classical technique of the hanging drop, in plates comprising 24 wells, we have moved on to plates with 96, 384 and, recently, 1536 wells. Obviously, this increase in dimensions requires the use of an automated system that includes a robot in charge of transferring microaliquots of the protein solution into the wells and adding media that differ according to their pH, ionic force and molecular composition to these wells. The crystallization process is followed by an automated microscopic examination coupled with video photography.",

One DNA nanomachine, which is admittedly still rudimentary, has been put together based on the structural difference that exists between B-DNA, the classical double helix that twists to the right, and Z-DNA, a double helix that twists to the left. A propensity to adopt the Z-form is triggered when there is an alternating sequence of cytosine (C) and guanine (G) (CG sequence) in the DNA. The experiment illustrated in figure IV.8 makes use of a duplex formed of B-double helices. The DNA nanomachine constructed by N.C. SEEMAN comprised a duplex of double strands of DNA. One of the double strands, of the classical B-form of DNA (right-hand twist), has been cleaved in such a way as to fix fluorescent molecular probes onto the cleavage zones. Facing this cleavage zone, a short nucleotide sequence, in which the cytosine (C) guanine (G) motif is repeated, can be found in the other DNA double strand, which is also of B-form. The addition of cobaltihexammine induces the transition of the CG segment from a right-hand twist (B-DNA) to a left-hand twist (Z-DNA), which leads to a rotation of this segment and to a rotation of the assembly, which can be detected using FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) spectroscopy. One of the double helices has a short CG segment. Facing the CG segment, the other double helix is interrupted, and its ends, where the interruption is, carry fluorescent molecular probes. The simple fact of adding a cationic substance such as cobaltihexammine, which neutralizes the negative charges of the phosphate groups, triggers a conformational transition, with the CG segment taking the Z-form, causing a rotational movement of the assembly that is detected by the movement of the probes.",

The control involved the use of sense RNAs according to a classical protocol. Unexpectedly, protein synthesis was blocked in both cases, suggesting that a contaminant was present in the sense and antisense RNA preparations. This contaminant was identified as a double strand RNA (dsRNA -double strand) that is, an RNA that is folded back on itself in a \"hairpin\" loop because of the pairing of complementary bases (adenine vs uracil and guanine vs cytosine). In order to verify the mechanism by which the translation of messenger RNAs into proteins is silenced, the nematode C. elegans was injected with a synthetic dsRNA, part of the sequence of which was complementary to that of the gene unc-22, known to code for a protein involved in muscular contraction.

One of the single strand RNAs (siRNA -small interfering RNA) is paired thanks to a complementarity of bases with a short sequence of messenger RNA transcribed from the gene unc-22. The result is a blockage of the translation of messenger RNA into a protein, followed by the destruction of messenger RNA. This phenomenon was named RNA interference ( Figure IV The DICER cleavage enzyme, which has a ribonuclease activity, cuts the double strand RNA into two strands. In the presence of the RISC (RNA-Induced Silencing Complex) protein complex, one of the RNA strands finds a complementary nucleotide sequence in a messenger RNA (mRNA) and associates itself with this RNA, making it unable to be translated into protein. We now know that eukaryotic cells from animals and plants produce and host interfering RNAs that are said to be \"natural\" 28 . Natural interfering RNAs, of around twenty nucleotides, are called microRNAs (miRNAs). Although a few details differ between the modes of formation and action of natural interfering RNAs and those of synthetic interfering RNAs, in particular the fact that messenger RNAs are not destroyed by miRNAs but blocked in their translation, the effect of negative regulation on the production of specific proteins comes to the same thing ( Figure IV.9 ). There is a far from negligible number of genes that code for miRNAs. Already, several hundred miRNAs have been identified in the genomes of plants and animals.

Results led to predictions that it would be possible to transfer a fragment of DNA corresponding to a gene of a certain species into the genome of another species and have this foreign gene express itself as a protein in the host cell. In 1983, the successful trans-genesis of a gene for resistance to an antibiotic, kanamycin, in tobacco plants, signaled the beginning of the technology of the first plant-type genetically modified organisms, still called GMPs (genetically modified plants). In 1996, the birth of Dolly the ewe unveiled the era of reproductive cloning in mammals, i.e., the identical reproduction of an already-existing organism. An additional step was taken with the first tests on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells towards different types of lines that are characteristic of well-defined tissues, such as nerve tissue, cardiac tissue or the hepatic parenchyma, thus opening up promising perspectives in regenerative medicine.

The transformed cells were selected according to the criterion of their resistance to this antibiotic, which involved a risk of dissemination of the resistance gene. This selection technique has been abandoned. In practice, it is difficult to evaluate the theoretical ecological risk of wild plants being invaded by genes that have been inserted artificially into GMOs. As a precaution, zones used for experimentation of plant GMOs are now surrounded by refuge zones, i.e., fields in which the same species of plants, in non-GMO form, are cultivated. There has been a much fiercer and completely legitimate debate concerning the presence of the Terminator gene in seed from the first GMOs marketed by the Monsanto company in the USA. The Terminator gene blocked germination of the seed from the cultivated plant, so it was necessary for the farmer to buy more seed from the company each season, thus creating a state of dependency. This technique is no longer in use, but the fact remains that most transgenic seed is patented, and therefore farmers who use such seed are dependent on the companies that posses this genetic know-how.",

Common sense and lucid thought dictate that the debate should be situated within a scientific perspective in which the main role is played by the experimental method in long-term applications. Simple reflection leads us to think that with time parasites and self-propagating plants will develop a resistance to the most drastic treatments, as was the case for bacteria confronted with antibiotics. The perspective of an acquisition of uncontrolled resistances, which gives rise to so much passionate debate, is, in fact, only the first stage of a technology with promising applications. The mastery of plant transgenesis that was acquired through the first experimentations should, in fact, allow the emergence of plant GMOs that are assigned to the production of molecules with therapeutic effects (drugs, vaccines, human proteins, vitamins\u2026). In this domain, there have already been creations that include golden rice, which carries \u03b2-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A, banana plants that express a vaccine against hepatitis B and tobacco that produces human lactotransferrin and hemoglobin. If we just look at the production of golden rice as a palliative for vitamin A deficiency, it should be remembered that, in certain countries of our planet, this deficiency affects people's sight and is a frequent cause of blindness, that it generates problems with development and the immune response to infections, that it affects more than a hundred million children around the world and that it is responsible for the death of three million of them each year. If these plants are considered to be a material of choice for the production of proteins with a therapeutic effect, this is partly due to the yield of such crops over large surface areas, and also partly due to the low risk of transmission of viral pathogens to Man, because of the species barrier, a risk that is less negligible when animal productions are involved. Genetically modified plants are also potential factories for the manufacture of chemical products with an industrial impact, for example lubricants, perfumes and aromas. Given the unpredictable outlets that plant GMOs may have in human medicine and the different domains of the economy, plant GMO technology should be considered in a manner that is free of any pressure or passion, and, as far as the political authorities are concerned, it should be subject to appropriate measures to surround and protect certain strategic experiments.",

The nervousness of European authorities, showing an ignorance of basic scientific ideas, with the pretext of a principle of precaution, and sometimes political compromises that are exemplified by fluctuating and contradictory positions, runs the risk, in the short term, of causing their countries to lag disadvantageously behind the United States of America, which holds the majority of plant biotechnology patents.",

The technical difficulty involved in gene therapy is that of finding an appropriate vehicle or vector for the transfer of the gene and addressing it to an appropriate location in the genome of the host cell. The most commonly used vectors in human gene therapy are viral. A certain number of criteria are necessary for a transfer to be efficacious, including a high concentration of viral particles carrying the gene to be transferred (more than a billion viral particles per milliliter) and a good capability on the part of the foreign gene to be integrated into the host's genome. The patient's immune response remains a major worry in the use of viral vectors: at cell level it often leads to a proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and, especially at humoral level, to the synthesis of antibodies directed against the viral proteins. In order to minimize its immune response, the genetic material of the viral vectors is modified.",

It was with this in mind that mouse gene therapy models were developed a few years ago. The sickle cell mouse is one of these models. Human drepanocytosis (sickle cell anemia) is a serious disease that is caused by a mutation in the \u03b2 protein chain of normal human hemoglobin A. The molecules of sickle cell hemoglobin S tend to aggregate and form fibers that obstruct the blood capillaries of the microcirculation.

The purpose of this therapy was to bring about a long term remission in the case of an immune disease known as SCID-X1 (Severe Combined ImmunoDeficiency linked to a mutation on the X chromosome). Because of their susceptibility to microbial and viral infections, babies who are affected can only survive in sterile rooms. They are known as bubble babies. In this illness, the hematopoietic progenitor cells of the bone marrow are unable to differentiate into T and NK (Natural Killer) lymphocytes because of a mutation that affects a cytokine receptor. Previous experiments carried out on model mice show that SCID can be corrected by in vivo transfer of the cytokine receptor gene into hematopoietic progenitors. The transfer of the gene of interest paired with a retroviral vector was carried out first in March 1999, in two babies, one of them eleven months and the other two months old. Progenitor cells from their own bone marrow, cultured and modified genetically, were injected into them. These were therefore autografts, without any risk of immune rejection. A remission of symptoms over a period of nearly a year, shown by the almost normal behavior of the babies' immune cells, encouraged the application of the same therapy to other babies. In total, ten babies were given this therapy. The enthusiasm that greeted the successes that were recorded was nevertheless tempered by fact that in the spring of 2002, and again in the following year, a child who had undergone the gene therapy developed a leukemia characterized by an anarchical proliferation of lymphocytes, necessitating chemotherapy. These two occurrences were explained by the random character of the insertion of the gene of interest into the patients' genomes: insertion into a site close to a proto-oncogene had led to activation of this proto-oncogene and the proliferation of the lymphocytes. While the trial carried out at the Necker hospital gave rise to great hopes, it nevertheless showed that there is still a long way to go before we achieve a targeted transfection of genes so that no undesirable consequences follow. Here we have a typical example of the limits of an experimental method that is based on an in-depth technological know-how, but also on a still imperfect understanding of the complex arcana of the mechanisms that regulate the positioning and interaction of genes in the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells. This example highlights a harrowing ethical dilemma: should we not treat a patient whose illness is likely to be fatal, or attempt a therapy that may save the patient, without having any formal assurance of its success?",

The experimental protocol is simple. Bone marrow cells from a mouse are injected into another mouse that has previously been irradiated in order to destroy its stem cells. The injected cells go to the spleen where they divide and form colonies that take the form of nodules of different sizes.

After fertilization by a sperm cell, the ovum undergoes a series of divisions that give rise to a microstructure, the blastocyst, the cells of which are called blastomeres. Each isolated blastomere remains capable of producing an entire organism of fetus and placenta, by division and differentiation. At this stage, blastomeres are totipotent. Five days after fertilization, the embryo has the form of a hollow sphere. An external layer of cells, the trophoectoderm, surrounds a cavity, the blastocele, inside which a small mass of cells, the inner cell mass, protrudes. From the beginning of the implantation of the blastocyt in the uterus, the trophoectoderm evolves to form the placenta. The cells of the inner cell mass take part in the process of differentiation that generates all of the tissues of the future adult organism. These are called embryonic stem cells (ES cells). ES cells are said to be pluripotent. Isolated, they have lost their ability to give rise to a complete individual, but they have maintained the possibility of differentiating, according to their environment, into any of the two hundred cell types that make up animal tissues. During their division, ES cells evolve from a stage of being pluripotent to a stage of being unipotent, passing through a stage of multipotency beyond a hundred cells. A state of multipotency characterizes cells that give rise to a restricted number of cell lines in the tissues in which they nest. This is the case for of the hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow that form the red blood cells and the white blood cells. The term unipotent refers to the progenitors, which give rise to a single type of cell, for example the hepatocyte of the liver or the cardiomyocyte of the heart.",

There are many publications about experiments concerning the grafting of differentiated stem cells in the mouse or the rat. For example, neuron precursors derived from the spinal cord or the brain are grafted into rats whose spinal chords have been injured. Five weeks after the grafts are carried out, the transplanted cells have filled the area of the injury and differentiated into oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons. What is more, after about twelve weeks, locomotive function has been partially restoredIrradiated 33 . Other experiments involving the grafting of differentiated stem cells have been carried out on rats in which the dopaminergic neurons of the \"substantia nigra\" of the brain that secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine have been selectively destroyed by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. The problems found in the rat as a result of this neuronal degenerescence mimic those found in Man in patients suffering from PARKINSON's disease. Dopaminergic neurons obtained by the differentiation of mouse ES cells are grafted into the striatum of each of these rats, a region of the brain whose neurons communicate with those of the substantia nigra and play a fundamental role in the control of movement. This results in a significant improvement in the motor deficit, coupled with the establishment of functional synapses between the injected neurons and those of the host 34,35 .

In 1981, the first ES cells from mouse blastocysts were isolated and successfully cultured by two groups of researchers in Great Britain and the USA. It was only in 1998 that human embryonic stem cells (hES) were isolated for the first time 37 and held in culture, on a nutritive layer of fibroblasts from irradiated mice. This delay with respect to the ability to culture animal ES cells can be explained by the fact that the molecular machinery that activates replication and cell differentiation programs is not completely identical in Man and the mouse 38 . For example, a cytokine called LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor), which is indispensable for the renewal of ES cells in an undifferentiated state in the mouse, has no effect on human ES cells. There are several other differences concerning the control of proliferation and differentiation in human and murine ES cells by growth factors. Briefly, the conclusions obtained from experiments carried While there is a highly promising future for the use of ES cells, this future is littered with obstacles, and rigorous checks and balances need to be put in place. Nevertheless, research on such cells is mandatory if we wish to move on to a regenerative medicine that aims to be a new frontier in the art of healing. After specific differentiation, hES cells could provide unlimited quantities of the tissues needed to replace damaged tissues responsible for handicapping illnesses (dopaminergic neurons in PARKINSON's disease, cardiomyocytes in myocardial infarction, pancreatic islets of LANGERHANS cells in diabetes, fibroblasts in skin grafts, chondrocytes in rhumatoid arthritis). In addition, metabolic analysis of hES cells carrying defective genes whose phenotypical expression is known in human pathology should improve our understanding of the perturbed mechanisms, and could lead to pharmacological advances. As well as the technical difficulties involved, which have not yet been adequately overcome, the handling of hES cells is subject to much ethical debate in many countries, with those who object to it holding to their prejudices, which are linked to religious or cultural traditions. This is the case in France, where, nevertheless, a few timid dispensations had begun to appear at the time of writing. In contrast, in Great Britain, the law authorizes the isolation of hES cells for therapeutic purposes, using embryos of less than one hundred cells, produced by in vitro fertilization, and surplus to requirements. The British response to the burning question of whether an isolated hEs cell may be considered as a potential human embryo is clearly \"no\", for, in order to be able to develop in utero, such hES cells would need to have the placental progenitor cells.",

Considered to be foreign by the receiver (host), grafted stem cells coming from a donor are rejected. This obstacle could be overcome by using the technique of cloning. Based on experiments on several animal species, it is now accepted that the transfer of the nucleus of an adult somatic cell from a host into an enucleated oocyte makes it possible to obtain from this oocyte, which is once again nucleated, and which is the equivalent of a zygote and able to divide, ES cells whose genome is identical to that of the host. Because of this, the ES cells are immunologically compatible with the tissues of the host. In Man, such cells could be directed by differentiation towards stable cell lines creating well-defined tissues and organs (liver, muscle\u2026) that could be used in regenerative medicine. This is the principle of therapeutic cloning. In March 2004, Korean veterinary researcher Woo Suk HWANG (b. 1953) and his co-workers, who were recognized experts in animal cloning, announced in the American review Science 39 that they had succeeded for the first time in obtaining around thirty human blastocysts by cloning, i.e., by the transfer of nuclei of somatic cells into enucleated ova. This first experiment involved autologous cloning (ovum nuclei and enucleated somatic cells taken from the same woman). HWANG and his team used 176 ova, and the yield from the experiment was close to that obtained at that time for the cloning of mammals. Using the inner cell mass of one of the blastocysts, they isolated a line of embryonic stem cells able to maintain a normal karyotype after several dozen divisions. This publication, which appeared in a highly prestigious scientific review, triggered an enthusiasm in the media that was in keeping with the spectacular nature of the team's exploit, tempered here and there by a few comments that were mainly linked to questions of medical ethics. In 2005, there were numerous other articles by the same team on the same subject, reinforcing the first results with a heterologous cloning technique (ovum nuclei and enucleated somatic cells taken from different people), thus giving rise to great hopes that the era of regenerative medicine was near. At the beginning of 2006, Professor HWANG's retractation of all his work, and a public confession of a spectacular fraud, were even more dramatic, offering certain media an occasion for a disproportionate level of fury against therapeutic cloning. However, despite such rear-guard combats, it is obvious that one day these technical difficulties will be overcome. Human cloning, in order to obtain stem cells for therapeutic purposes, cannot escape the future. Once this aim has been achieved, it will be spoken of as the outcome of a long story.",

In Developmental Biology 40 , two American researchers, Robert BRIGGS (1911 -1983) and Thomas KING (1921 -2000 described experiments involving the transfer of cell nuclei of embryos from a frog (Rana pipiens), at the blastula and gastrula stages, into enucleated eggs of the same species. A high percentage of the clones obtained in this way were able to reach the tadpole stage when the transferred nuclei came from the early blastula stage, but only mediocre success was achieved when the nuclei came from the later gastrula stage. These experiments emphasized both the totipotency of the embryo somatic cells and the equivalency of the somatic cell nucleus and the nucleus of the fertilized egg in cell division and differentiation. BRIGGS and KING's publication did not arouse any particular interest. It is true that the 1960s were dominated by the saga of molecular biology, which would reach its culmination in the deciphering of the genetic code.",

Moving from the amphibian egg, which was a millimeter wide, to a mammal egg that was one hundred times smaller, presented a technical difficulty that would be overcome by a technique of cell-to-cell electrofusion. Cloned embryos were thus obtained by nuclear transfer and then implanted into the uterus of a surrogate female. However, in all cases, the nucleus came from embryo cells. In February 1997, the announcement made by Ian WILMUT (b. 1944), Keith H. CAMPBELL (b. 1954) and their collaborators at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute 41 of the birth of the cloned lamb Dolly had an immediate effect in the media. In fact, this was not only the cloning of a higher mammal, but, above all, the cloning by insertion of an adult somatic cell, in this case a mammary tissue cell, into an enucleated oocyte. This went far further than the experiment carried out by BRIGGS and KING, which essentially involved the transfer of embryo cell nuclei into enucleated frog eggs. The trick that gave WILMUT and CAMPBELL their success was to bring the cells providing the nuclei to a quiescent state corresponding to the interphase stage of the cell cycle, by impoverishing their culture medium, before electrofusion with enucleated oocytes. Although we should be aware that 434 attempts were made before a positive result was achieved, this does not make it any less astonishing that the nucleus of a cell in its adult state, i.e., completely differentiated, was able to behave as if it were totipotent. Despite being committed to a program of differentiation that is considered to be more-or-less irreversible, and which will give it a specific identity, the nucleus of an adult cell can be reprogrammed and become totipotent. Since Dolly, many other mammals have been cloned from nuclei of adult cells; mice, cows, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, rats and horses. As far as ethical discussion about cloning is concerned (Chapter IV.5), it is essential to note that the demarcation line between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning is situated where decisions are made concerning the destiny of the cloned blastocyst ( Figure IV .13). The transfer of the nucleus of a somatic cell (liver, epidermis, muscle) containing 2n chromosomes into an enucleated oocyte gives rise to an egg (2n chromosomes) that is able to divide and to produce a blastocyst. The cells of the blastocyst inner cell mass (ICM) can be used as stem cells that can differentiate into different types of cell line (therapeutic cloning). On the other hand, if the whole blastocyst is implanted into a uterus, it will produce an embryo which, after birth, will grow into an adult animal (reproductive cloning). Reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning therefore differ because of the fact that in reproductive cloning, the whole blastocyst is used, while in therapeutic cloning, only certain cells, corresponding to the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst, are used.

The key to the mechanism responsible is in the epigenetic type chemical modifications of cell DNA, for example methylations, which repress the expression of certain genes without altering the expression of others. These modifications of the DNA, which control cellular specificity (muscle, liver, brain\u2026) are not very reversible, but, in certain circumstances, they can become so. This is what happens from time to time when the nucleus of an adult cell is inserted into an enucleated oocyte. We are thus able to assume that in the molecular arsenal of the oocyte cytoplasm there are substances that can cancel the epigenetic modifications of the DNA present in the nucleus of an adult somatic cell and recreate a state of pluripotency in this nucleus, or, in other words, provoke the reprogramming of the somatic cell nucleus. In the long term, it is to be hoped that biochemical technology will be able to find and purify the molecules responsible for the nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells.",

This exploit is achieved by the invalidation of one of the genes (H19) involved in the control of the parental imprint. It is known that sexual reproduction in mammals involves a phenomenon called the parental imprint, which, by means of the methylation of DNA and perhaps also of histones, allows the expressing or silencing of certain genes in male and female gametes. A single copy of a given gene, originating either from the oocyte or from the sperm cell, is therefore expressed, while the other is inactive. In the Japanese experiment, if the mouse H19 gene had not been invalidated, the result would have been an anarchical development of the responsible genes involved in the parental imprint with overexpression in the case of some and an absence of expression in the case of others. These disturbances would have been incompatible with the viability of the embryo. However limited its application might be, the manipulation of the germinal genome poses the problem of the mechanism by which the parental imprint intervenes in the viability of the egg, a parameter that at the time of writing is still not completely understood, but is being actively explored.",

For reasons of genetic and physiological similarity, the first choice for such grafts was to use apes or monkeys. However, this idea was quickly abandoned, for several reasons; a non-negligible risk of viral infection due to the phylogenetic kinship of human and simian species; a slow growth rate; a low reproduction rate and, finally, laws that protect primates. These disadvantages are not found, or are at least minimized, in the pig: the risk of a viral infection passing from the pig to Man should be low because of the species barrier (but nevertheless, it ought to be evaluated), the pig growth rate is relatively rapid, pig litters are large and pig organs are of a size close to those of Man.",

The pig xenoantigen that is considered to be the one mainly responsible for the phenomenon of rejection in Man is a sugar molecule, galactose \u03b1-1,3-galactose, located on the plasma membrane of endothelial cells. Synthesis of this molecule requires the enzyme \u03b1-1,3-galactosyltransferase, which is present in most mammals, but absent in Man and the primates. This enzyme disappeared in Man around twenty million years ago, following a double mutation of the gene.

This has been the case for vaccinations against infectious diseases or for prevention of microbial infections by means of aseptic or antiseptic methods. With the breakthroughs made in genetic manipulation at the end of the 20 th century, it was more than just the results of experiments on living beings that attracted the attention of the political authorities, it was, above all, the manner in which the experimental method, with all its hazards, made use of living material, sometimes of human origin, in order to unlock mysteries. Conscious of the social impact of emerging discoveries that are subject to considerable media coverage and are sensationalized in both the written and audiovisual media, the State, with the help of researchers and philosophers, has laid down a code of bioethics, applied through strict or even restrictive legislation.

In \"remaking\" living beings according to imposed norms, and in scheduling, in a certain fashion, the manufacture of life according to new codes, certain questions move from the \"how\" to the \"why\", i.e., from the scientific domain that is accessible to human thought to the metaphysical sphere, with its problems of the limit of what is surmountable and tolerable in terms of ethics.",

To understand the causes of epidemics, nutritional deficiencies, metabolic deviations of hereditary origin and degenerative illnesses, and then to translate these causes in cellular and molecular terms, this was the process undertaken by medicine once it began to use the experimental method. In fact, for several decades, from the beginning of the 19 th century, medicine had already undergone some major revisions of outdated practices and had inaugurated a new era in diagnosis. For example, the differential diagnosis of pulmonary ailments became possible because of the invention of the stethoscope by Ren\u00e9 LAENNEC (1781 -1826) and the practice of auscultation and percussion by Joseph SKODA (1805 -1881), the uncontested master of the Vienna school.

In the middle of the 20 th century, the spectacular recovery from high-incidence infectious diseases such as pneumococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis or acute forms of tuberculosis, which that was brought about by antibiotics, gave rise to the idea that medicine had won a battle against the microbial world and that, from then on, it would be able to control the evolution of infectious diseases and to offer rational treatments. The gradual appearance of a microbial resistance to antibiotics has brought an end to this euphoric era. Penicillin, for example, which was put on the market at the end of the 1940s, was active on practically all strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Sixty years later, more than 90% of the strains of this same microbe are resistant to penicillin. The incidence of nosocomial infections, which are contracted in health care facilities, never ceases to rise. At present, around 10% of the hospitalizations that take place are complicated by the patient developing a nosocomial infection. Equally worrying are the re-emergence of diseases that were once considered to be under control, such as tuberculosis or poliomyelitis in Africa, and the emergence of new diseases such as AIDS, whose HIV virus (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which was identified at the beginning of the 1980s, has generated a pandemic that has spread throughout the planet. Infectious diseases are currently responsible for more than a quarter of human deaths.

We have only to remember the dreadful contagiousness and aggressivity of the Spanish flu virus (Influenzavirus AH1N1) which, in 1918 -1919, killed more human beings around the world than the First World War that preceded it. In contrast, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2003, the vector of which was doubtless the civet, a small carnivore raised in China and desired for its meat, was rapidly contained because of its low contagiousness and also because of the isolation measures that were taken. Human behavior is not without its effect on the emergence of viral diseases. The growth in intercontinental travel and human migration, as well as intensive deforestation in Africa and South America, which bring virus vectors into contact with Man, are factors concerned in the emergence of viral diseases that risk being explosive and devastating. In this context, the history of the Ebola virus and of the Marburg virus, which cause violent hemorrhaging, is edifying. In 1967, in the German village of Marburg, an epidemic of unknown origin broke out, the illness manifesting itself with brutal suddenness by vomiting, diarrhea, a high fever and an increased tendency to bleed. This pathology, which was contained rapidly by means of drastic isolation measures, was found to be of viral origin. The pathogen concerned was a filovirus (filiform virus). A brief enquiry showed that the origin of the epidemic was contact between technicians of a pharmaceutical company and monkeys that had been imported from Uganda and that were carrying the virus. In 1976, two other epidemics, characterized by severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fevers, were reported in the Sudan and the Republic of the Congo.

Given the means that are available to the contemporary clinician in order to assign each of these diseases to a genetic defect, one can only be amazed by the mass of information about them that has accumulated over a century, since the first diagnosis of a hereditary disease, alcaptonuria, which was made in 1902 by Archibald GARROD (1857 -1936), a doctor at London's St Bartholomew's hospital. Alcaptonuria is a non-serious genetic flaw that can be detected easily by a blackening of the urine. It is the result of a blockage caused by the mutation of an enzyme involved in the catabolism of an amino acid, tyrosine, this blockage leading to the accumulation of homogentisic acid, the polymerization of which gives rise to a brownish color. The patient examined by GARROD was a young boy. Investigation of the family history revealed that transmission of the flaw was correlated to cross-cousin marriages and followed MENDEL's laws for recessive traits. GARROD demonstrated other hereditary-type anomalies, cystinuria, porphyria and pentosuria. In 1909, these observations were published in a work that became a classic: Inborn Errors of Metabolism.",

This was the hemoglobin defect responsible for drepanocytosis or sickle cell anemia: a glutamic acid in the \u03b2 chain is replaced by a valine. The consequence of this simple change is a modification of the structure of the hemoglobin, leading to a sickle-shaped deformation of the red blood cells, the increased fragility of these cells and also a tendency towards cell lysis. This discovery made use of the electrophoresis and chromatography techniques that had just been introduced in biochemistry (Chapter III-6.2.2): such a discovery would not have been possible without these techniques. Because of the progress made in molecular biology, the nosological framework of hereditary diseases has been greatly enriched over the last twenty years. For example, at present, more than one hundred hereditary-type myopathies have been identified by accurately locating molecular lesions in the genomic DNA and characterizing the structural and functional modifications of the mutated proteins.",

Here again, as with other disciplines involved in the study of living beings, it arises from discoveries resulting from the principle of serendipity (Chapter III-2.2.3). This was the case when, in January 1987, a team in Grenoble, France 44 , led by the neurosurgeon Alim-Louis BENABID (b. 1942) and the neurologist Pierre POLLACK (b. 1950) discovered by accident that in patients affected by PARKINSON's disease a beneficial effect was achieved by deep, high-frequency electrical stimulation of the brain. The three major symptoms of PARKINSON's disease are muscular rigidity, a tremor when at rest and a slowing down of the execution of movements. In the 1960s, the Swedish team of Arvid CARLSSON (b. 1923) , who won the Nobel prize for Physiology and Medicine, demonstrated a relationship between the PARKINSON syndrome and a deficit in the secretion of a neurotransmitter, dopamine. A group of neurons that is limited to half a million (of the 100 billion contained in the brain) produces this neurotransmitter in a small structure located in the midbrain, called the substantia nigra. The neurons of the substantia nigra have elongations that interact with different nerve formations (called nuclei) including the subthalamic nucleus. In 1990, BERGMAN et al. 45 published an article that describes a curious relationship between a provoked lesion of the subthalamic nucleus and the disappearance of the signs of PARKINSON's disease in a monkey which had been made Parkinsonian by chemical treatment. This publication led the team in Grenoble to target their electrical stimulation on the subthalamic nucleus. This was completely successful. This electrical stimulation procedure, which is now well-codified, involves using stereotactic neurosurgical techniques, controlled by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, to implant an electrode into the subthalamic nucleus. The electrode is connected to a generator that is implanted under the patient's clavicle. The generator sends brief electrical impulses of frequencies from 100 to 200 Hz. Under the effect of this stimulation, the characteristic symptoms of the illness, particularly the static tremor and bradykinesis, regress in a spectacular manner. The mechanism by which this stimulation acts is not yet understood. No doubt this has to do with complex phenomena involving the inhibition of certain neuron relays near to the substantia nigra, which remain to be deciphered. Here we have a typical case of a progression from an experimental fact, discovered by accident, towards the analysis of its cause. From the point of view of the experimental method, it is interesting to make parallels between this discovery by serendipitous means of the beneficial role of electrical stimulation of the midbrain in PARKINSON's disease and Cartesian style programmed research that aims to graft into the brain of PARKINSON's disease sufferers embryonic stem cells differentiated into dopaminergic neurons 46 .",

In mice, a certain number of synthetic interfering RNAs have proved their efficacy in silencing genes which, following mutation, have acquired carcinogenic potential. However, the use of interfering RNAs as therapeutic agents requires them to be stabilized, because they are fragile molecules. The group headed by Achim AIGNER 48 (b. 1965 ), at the school of Medicine in Marburg, Germany, managed to stabilize a synthetic interfering RNA by complexing it with polyethyleneimine, and this interfering RNA is able to block the expression of a receptor involved in cancerization (c-erbB2/neu(HER-2) receptor).

Experimental practice has shown that, generally, this is far from being the case. Another example of the complex relationships that exist in living beings is the interference of the mental and the organic. One experiment that suggests this interference was carried out on mice who had acquired a form of pathology similar to HUNTINGTON's chorea, by transgenesis. Mice from the same line were separated into two batches, one acting as a control, and the other being subjected to daily mental stimulation, including memorization tests. Unexpectedly, the appearance of symptoms was noticeably slowed down in mice who had been subjected to mental gymnastics 49 , as if the brain, by intentionally mobilizing its neuron activity, was able to secrete substances able to alleviate its own defects.

Its power of exploration is such that it has been possible to analyze the brain response, in sleeping or awake babies who are only three months old, to auditory stimuli from language that either makes sense or does not make sense 50 .

A technique that is complementary to MRI is Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This generally uses water labeled with oxygen 15 ( 15 O), a radioactive isotope of natural oxygen that has a very short lifetime (123 s), produced extemporaneously in a cyclotron by bombardment of an 14 N target with protons. The radiolabeled water is injected into the blood flow of the patient. It is found in greater concentration in the zones that are the most irrigated by blood capillaries. The positrons that it emits collide with the surrounding electrons and give rise to photons that can be detected by the appropriate apparatus. Affected by a stimulus (whether this stimulus results from talking, writing or listening), the blood irrigation of the zones of the brain that have been specifically excited increases noticeably. The location of the positron emission provides information about the location of these zones. Within a few dozen minutes, it is possible to locate a highly vascularized cerebral tumor. PET can use molecules other than water, such as organic molecules labeled with positron-emitting atoms, ( 18 F) fluorine (half life 110 min) and ( 11 C) carbon (half life 20 min). Around twenty years ago, in Canada, an analogue of L-dopa, the precursor of dopamine in the brain, 18 F-6-L-fluorodopa, was synthesized, and was found to be an excellent probe for determining the capture capability of the endings of the dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. In patients suffering from PARKINSON's disease, this capture capability is noticeably reduced. At present, PET involving 18 F-6-L-fluorodopa is being used to evaluate the survival of dopaminergic cells grafted into the striata of PARKINSON's disease sufferers 51,52 .",

Hundreds of thousands of SNPs are present in the human genome and several tens of thousands in genes coding for the proteins. Where they are located differs according to ethnic backgrounds. Among these SNPs, some appear to be linked to certain pathologies, such as certain forms of cancer or degenerative illnesses such as ALZHEIMER's disease. In addition, in a small number of patients, the location of certain SNPs has been connected with previously-inexplicable drug incompatibilities. In line with these observations, pharmacogenomics, a branch of pharmacology that deals directly with genome sequence data, is trying to evaluate the impact of \"SNP variants\" on the efficacy and toxicity of drugs and to understand the genetic bases that explain the differences that are observed in the responses of different individuals to the same medication 53 . Rather than using a standard drug that is not very efficacious or causes adverse side effects, it might be possible, depending on the genetic profile of the patient, to use a drug that is more appropriate to his or her genetic map.

Provided there is a chemical library and we know the three-dimensional structure of a macromolecule, for example an enzyme, as well as the nature of the residues that define its active site, we can hope to select and chemically modify a substance that is able recognize the active site of this enzyme and to make an almost perfect ligand out of it which is able to efficiently block the operation of the target enzyme. This method, which is based on computer-aided chemistry, is called \"Structure-based drug design\", and has had some notable successes.

In a parallel manner to the exploration of the structures and functions of proteins, that of genomes has made remarkable progress. The subtle entanglements of genomics and proteomics that have become accessible to the experimental method are the order of the day. One major challenge for post-genomics is to understand how proteins, expressed by genes, interact with one another to generate functions that characterize cellular specificity. Even more ambitious are attempts to understand the operation of organs or even of living organisms, based on mechanisms that are implemented at molecular level. These attempts lead straight to an integrated biology, that is, a biology that aims to understand the overall functioning of living beings. Taking as its purpose the access to emerging functions, resulting from interactions between macromolecules, integrated biology first tries to invent methods that make it possible to detect these interactions.

The principle of this method is based on the modular nature of numerous transcription factors in eukaryotes. These factors contain both a DNA-binding domain that includes a specific DNA-binding site and a transcription activation domain that starts up the machinery for transcribing DNA into messenger RNA. These two domains can be dissociated and then re-associated in a functional manner, by forming hybrids with interacting proteins. A first protein, P1, is fused with the DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor by genetic manipulation, and a second protein, P 2 , is fused with the activation domain of the same transcription factor.

The study carried out by HENRI concerned the cleavage of sucrose (table sugar) into fructose and glucose by the action of an enzyme called invertase (sucrase). The term invertase was used because during reaction there was a change in the rotatory power of the sucrose solution, shown by a polarimeter. Analysis of the reaction suggested that an enzyme-substrate complex is formed, which breaks down to regenerate the enzyme and liberate the product of the reaction. This analysis gave rise to an equation for the speed of the enzyme reaction as a function of substrate concentration. HENRI published the results of his experiments both in his thesis, which he presented to the Paris Faculty of Sciences in 1902, and in two articles that appeared in the Reports of the Academy of Sciences 56,57 . In 1913, in Biochemische Zeitschrift (vol. 49, pp. 333-369), Leonor MICHA\u00cbLIS and Maud MENTEN (1879 -1960) confirmed the results of Victor HENRI and formulated an equation that became a classic, describing the speed of formation of a product from a substrate in enzyme catalysis.

Should we see the human soul as the programmer of a superb computer that never ceases to develop from the embryonic state onwards, like John ECCLES (1903 -1997) and others, or should we admit, like Jean-Pierre CHANGEUX (b. 1936), Stanislas DEHAENE (b. 1965), Daniel DENNETT (b. 1942) and others, that thought is not transcendent, and that it is intrinsically dependent on the brain, which is considered to be a neurochemical system, and thus look for the secret of the individuation of the human being in brain information storage mechanisms with retrocontrol loops associated with subtle neuron architectures, or, in short, refer to a sort of TURING machine? Whatever the case, in this domain, as in others, simple animal models are used in order to identify elementary processes that are able to explain easily-tested functions such as the memory in anatomical and physiological terms. This is the case for the sea slug or sea hare (Chapter III-6.1) which, despite its rudimentary cognitive capabilities, provides information that can be used to reconstruct higher cognitive functions, present in the brains of mammals. It is clear that the cognitive sciences have reached a stage in which they are emerging from their infancy (Chapter IV-3.2). Now, ingenious computing methods and a basis for reflection that has spread beyond the confines of psychology and philosophy, are available to them. They have set themselves the goal of producing an artificial intelligence, using ultrarapid computers as well as software that is able to model the operation of neural networks and to come close to the performance of human intelligence in terms of the power of their reactivity and their memorization. At present, many other biological systems are being subjected to multiparametric exploration, with the aim of producing models. This is the case, for example, with the program of the differentiation of certain white blood cells, the neutrophils (Chapter III-2.2.4), from precursors located in the bone marrow, a differentiation that leads to the emergence of functions such as phagocytosis that are implemented in the fight against microbial infections 60 .",

Making use of data obtained, the hope is to use mathematical processing to simulate the overall functioning of a cell, organ or organism. This new paradigm of the experimental method (\"systems biology\" 62 ) is not limited to a simple accumulation of observations concerning a given biological system and their abstraction in mathematical form. The originality of this approach is that it formulates predictions of changes in the behavior of a system as a function of the manipulation of parameters such as substrate concentration, the presence of inhibitors, and so on. The mathematical processing of experimental data, with a view to learning about the functioning of complex systems by modeling, is supported by the technosciences, particularly biocomputing. It is linked not only to the enormous sum of accumulated knowledge concerning the structures and functions of living beings in the post-genomic era, and to the notion that the life of a cell depends on multiple networks of molecular interactions and thousands of enzyme reactions located in its different organelles, but also to the information that comes to it from its environment. A first type of modeling is based on observations made or experiments carried out on an easy-to-study model system. Laws are drawn up from this. This so-called \"bottom-up\" (or synthetic) procedure, which proceeds from the simple to the complex, makes it necessary to have a set of very precise biochemical data. This great precision is all the more imperative in that any deviation, even a minimal one, in the integration of an experimental result can generate a mathematical model that is apparently plausible but which is unconnected to the living reality. The reverse, \"top-down\" (analytic) procedure proceeds from the overall operation of an organ and its theoretical analysis towards the specific mechanisms of its components. It takes into account the functioning of complex integrated systems such as the nerve and endocrine systems, immune and reproduction systems and the system controlling homeostasis, descending in stages towards the cellular, molecular and genetic levels.",

This makes it necessary to consider all of the genes (genome), all of the transcripts coding for the proteins (transcriptome), all non-coding RNAs (RNAome), all proteins expressed in a particular cell type (proteome) and all metabolites (metabolome) as a function of the enzyme catalyzers expressed and the energetics that underlie the catalyzed reactions, and, finally, to connect upstream events (mutations of genes and interference of messenger RNAs, chemical modifications to amino acid residues in the proteins) to phenotypical modifications on the scale of the whole organism (phenome) (Figure IV.19) . The goal of integrated or integrative biology (\"systems biology\") is therefore to put living beings into equations, that is, to represent them in virtual systems for which the behavior, accessible by means of calculation, can be predicted as a function of modifying parameters. In addition to the possibilities that are opened up in terms of a deeper understanding of physiological mechanisms, such virtual systems could be used for the design of new drugs or for the manufacture of economically valuable biomolecules. The diagram illustrates the different levels of complexity in the pathway that goes from all the genes together (genome) to all of the expressed characteristics (phenome) in the living being, passing via coding RNAs (transcriptome) and non-coding RNAs (non-coding RNAome), all the proteins (proteome), all addressing systems in the cell compartments (localisome) and all of the metabolic pathways (metabolome).",

In fact, in vivo, many enzymes record variations in activity that are hard to control due to allosteric type regulation or interenzyme contact; several enzymes of a metabolic pathway being able to interact to form a metabolon. However, by compacting several enzymes that catalyze contiguous reactions in a metabolic pathway, a metabolon considerably increases the catalytic efficiency of this pathway. Another element of uncertainty arises from the protein density of the cell medium, and also from the fact that covalent modifications of enzymes can introduce a change in endocellular location (nucleus, organelles of the cytoplasm\u2026). Nevertheless, an approximative approach could limit itself to dealing with biological systems in modular terms, i.e., to considering them as being made up of a number of black boxes, each black box containing a series of reactions being processed mathematically together, with an input and an output. There is still a long way to go if we place ourselves on the cellular scale, but the end of the pathway seems even further away if we envisage the organism as a whole, taking into account the remote interactions between organs involving the interplay of chemical mediators. The brain plays a critical role in the dialogue between different organs, and in the regulation of the energy equilibrium in higher animals. This equilibrium can be disturbed by fasting or intense, prolonged muscular activity, or by an overabundant diet. The corrective response comes from a deep region of the brain, the hypothalamus, via the secretion of different types of peptides, some of which stimulate the appetite and others of which suppress it 64 .",

            "text": "While taking into account the multitude of parameters that affect the complexity of living beings on an individual level, the theoretical approach to the study of cell function by modeling has the advantage that it produces predictions and provides information about the validity of conclusions and of theories based on experiments that are old and accepted in the absence of contradictory elements. This was the case for the theory that stated that the state of activation of a gene is determined only by the presence in its environment of transcription factors. Recent studies concerning the level of gene transcription in isolated cells have shown that there are probabilistic-type factors which mean that a given gene in a given cell can be activated at any moment. A review which came out in 2005 65 sums up this subject. In this review, the authors use modeling to analyze the behavior of cells in the process of differentiation during embryogenesis. Their Darwinian model, which associates contingency and selectivity, competes advantageously with the determinist (or instructive) model, based on an all-or-nothing logic, that has been implicitly accepted up until now. The Darwinian model takes into account the occurrence of stochastic events at gene expression level, events that are partially linked to the structural modifications to the chromatin that depend on covalent modifications of an epigenetic nature (phosphorylation, methylation\u2026). By basing itself on the existence of mutational fluctuations that arise by chance, associated with a selfregulation of gene expression, the model that is obtained shows that during embryogenesis a cell has a choice either to differentiate into another cell type or to remain in its initial state. Differentiated cells stabilize their own phenotype and, in their surroundings, stimulate the proliferation of foreign cell phenotypes. A harmonious equilibrium between these two processes is the necessary condition for the setting up of the steps that lead to the arrangement of different cell types during organogenesis, which take place in an apparently inescapable order, in the absence of disturbances. A break in this equilibrium leads to an anarchical cell proliferation. Generally speaking, from the point of view of experimental science, the lesson that can be drawn from current modeling experiments is that the Bernardian determinism that has prevailed as the essential foundation stone of the methodology applied to the study of living beings may find itself being requalified by the taking into account of stochastic phenomena. This is the case when the number of reacting molecules is low and the probability of stochastic events is non negligible. The modeling of such systems necessitates having recourse to a complex mathematical formalism. It remains true that determinist models for simulation of the dynamics of living beings, represented by classical differential equations, are more-or-less valid when the number of reacting molecules involved is high and the reactions supposedly take place in a homogeneous medium.",

The brain being considered as an information processing machine, the aim is to understand the logic of this information machine by means of simulations on computers and, based on the results obtained, to construct robots whose electrical circuits take their inspiration from the operation of animal neurons. These robots are called biorobots or animats. Insects have been chosen as a reference for the construction of such creatures because of the relative simplicity of their nervous systems: several hundred thousand neurons, in comparison with the billions of neurons present in mammals (100 billion in Man). The fly's system of vision has been favored as a subject of study because of the possibility it offers of being able to record the electrical response of neurons that can be identified one by one. In the middle of the 1980s, in France, this inspired the pioneering work in biorobotics carried out by Nicolas FRANCESCHINI (b. 1942) and his team 67,68 (Figure IV.20) . Their objective was to study how an animal can avoid obstacles by means of its ocular perception and its movement-detecting neurons, the operation of which the team just analyzed using microelectrodes and a microscope-telescope specially built for the purpose. The fly's composite eye has 3 000 elementary units or ommatidia, each carrying eight light receptor neurons. The electrical signals emitted by these neurons in response to captured light (at most a few dozen millivolts) are sent to subjacent neurons that are organized into three levels that correspond to the optical ganglions called the \"lamina\", \"medulla\" and \"lobula\". The lobula is a strategic decoding center which, because of the small number of neurons contained in it (sixty), has been the subject of in-depth electrophysiological investigation. Each of the sixty neurons of the lobula operates as a signal integrator. The neurons of the lobula send their messages to motor neurons involved in the contraction of small muscles that control the guidance and stabilization of the fly's flight.",

Using a remote measurement device, it was possible to explore certain behavioral aspects of the insect. Although the construction of hybrid robots may raise ethical objections, such technology is capable of giving rise to spectacular applications in the domain of prostheses. The neurological prostheses of the future will nevertheless require that a contact be made between living neurons and the electronic chips that are able to improve the inadequate processing of the physio- logical signal. Such a contact was produced recently in a German laboratory directed by Peter FROMHERZ 73 (b. 1942) . A small network of snail neurons, chosen because of their large size, was cultured on the surface of a silicon chip. A signal emitted at one location of the chip was able to be transmitted to another location via the synapse connection between two neurons 73 ( Figure IV.21) .

The mechanism involved is said to be chemiosmotic. The most important experiment involved an almost serendipitous observation, carried out with a simple pH meter. When a current of oxygen was passed through a suspension of mitochondria in an unbuffered saline medium, in the absence of ADP and phosphate, an instantaneous acidification of the extramitochondrial medium occurred, shown by means of the pH meter electrode immersed in this medium. It was concluded that the sudden switch from anaerobiosis to aerobiosis, i.e., the start up of respiration, is correlated with an ejection of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the extramitochondrial medium. Afterwards, this fact was linked with several others, the whole leading to the formulation of the chemiosmotic theory. Briefly, mitochondrial respiration generates a vectorial movement of protons from the interior to the exterior of the mitochondrion. Because of this, a proton concentration difference is established on either side of the mitochondrial membrane. The electrical potential that is created in this way is used by the mitochondrial ATPase in order to synthesize ATP from ADP and mineral phosphate. This process involves two correlated events: return movement of protons towards the inside of the mitochondrion across the Fo sector of the ATPase; rotation of the assembly of c subunits and the \u03b3 subunit that is interdependent with it.",

            "text": "The existence of a rotational movement of mitochondrial ATPase, which had been suggested on the basis of biochemical arguments 74 and of structural data 75 was authenticated by Masasuke YOSHIDA and his co-workers in Japan in 1997, thanks to an imaging technique 76 . In a first step, the molecular system was simplified by being limited to the catalytic F1 sector of the enzyme. A methodological trick was employed: genetic engineering was used to modify the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of this sector by fixing polyhistidine chains to them. Because of the strong affinity between polyhistidine and nickel ions, the F1 sector \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits were immobilized on a medium covered with nickel ions (carried by an organic molecule). An actin filament labeled with a fluorescent ligand was attached to the end of the F1 sector \u03b3 subunit. This assembly made it possible, under a fluorescence microscope, to display a rotational movement of the actin arm carried by the g subunit affected by the addition of ATP and by its hydrolysis into ADP and mineral phosphate. A similar rotational movement of the \u03b3 subunit carrying a metal microbar was observed by an American research group 77 . Remarkably, in 2004, after having fixed a metal microbead onto the \u03b3 subunit, the Japanese researchers 78 demonstrated synthesis of ATP from ADP and mineral phosphate by rotating the \u03b3 subunit by means of rotation of the magnetic bead, induced by magnets. Thus, the experimental coupling of a mechanical force and a chemical synthesis was demonstrated. In 2005, the Japanese research team 79 succeeded in photographing the rotational movement of the enzyme powered by ATP under the microscope, this time looking at the entire ATPase complex, F1Fo. After having attached a gold microbead onto the \"c\" subunits of the Fo sector, to act as a probe, the researchers were able to confirm that the rotational movement of these subunits depended on the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and phosphate ( Figure IV.22) . The whole of the mitochondrial ATPase (ATP synthase) does, in fact, function as a molecular rotational motor powered by a proton flow, rather like an industrial rotational motor powered by a fossil fuel or electricity. The analogy is a striking one; the \u03b3 subunit of the enzyme corresponds to the motor driveshaft and the \"c\" subunits correspond to the motor itself. Because of its association with non-living structures, for example metal bars or gold beads, which are carried along in the rotational movement of the enzyme, it is possible to speak of molecular biorobots. This domain, in which nanomachines use macromolecules from the living world, has only just opened up, but its future is full of promise.",

ATPase or ATP synthase (reversible catalysis enzyme that hydrolyzes or synthesizes ATP) has two sectors (see Figure III .18). The membrane sector, Fo, comprises an assembly of a dozen so-called c (rotor) subunits and an a (stator) subunit. The other, extra-membrane sector, F1, is catalytic. It comprises three \u03b2 catalytic subunits and three \u03b1 non-catalytic subunits arranged in a ring, in alternating order. At the center of the ring is the \u03b3 subunit which is attached to the c subunits of the Fo sector. Subunits \u03b4, \u03b5 and b stabilize the whole of the molecular complex. In the experiment illustrated in this figure, subunits \u03b1 and \u03b2 of the F1 sector of the enzyme have been genetically modified to include polyhistidine chains (His-tag, artificial ligand). Due to the interaction of these chains with nickel ions (linked to an organic molecule) covering a solid support medium, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits are immobilized. In addition, a gold microbead is fixed onto the ring of the Fo sector c subunits by means of a chemical device (streptavidin molecule, artificial ligand). Following the addition of ATP, rotation of the microbead attached to the ring of Fo sector c subunits is observed by microscopy on a black background. This rotation is dependent on (and at the same time an indicator of) the rotation of the c subunits, itself led by the rotation of the \u03b3 subunit in contact with the catalytic \u03b2 subunits. Note the ejection of protons. When the enzyme functions as ATP synthase, the proton movement takes place in the opposite direction. ",

There have been premonitory concepts that, while they were demolished at the time they were first proposed, were shown to be completely accurate a few decades later. In the middle of the 19 th century, the German pathologist Jacob HENLE (1809 -1885) needed a healthy dose of imagination and audacity in order to oppose the theory of the \"miasma\", a theory that was taught as a dogma, with a new theory that not only explained the spread of contagious diseases by microscopic beings, but also formulated the criteria for validating this theory, i.e., isolation of the pathogenic agent and its development in culture away from the diseased organism, then reproduction of the original pathology after injection of the pathogenic agent, which has been isolated, characterized and multiplied in a culture, into a model animal. Thirty years would go by before the formulation of KOCH's postulates, based on experimental evidence (Chapter III-4).

It is thus that the double helix DNA structure proposed by CRICK and WATSON, based on the complementarity of Adenine-Thymine and Cytosine-Guanine bases (Chapter IV-1.1.1), led to the concept of DNA replication with reconstruction of a double strand that is identical to the original double strand. The concept of DNA replication spurred on Matthew  MESELSON (b. 1930) and Franklin STAHL (b. 1929) to develop an experimental protocol based on the labeling of the DNA nucleotide bases of the enterobacterium E. coli with a heavy isotope of Nitrogen, 15 N, and on the differentiation of monocatenary DNA strands in the process of synthesis by measurement of their density, as analyzed by centrifugation in cesium chloride gradients. In the same vein, JACOB and MONOD's discovery of regulatory genes (Chapter IV-1.1.1) gave rise to the concept of the operon which, in the bacterium, defines a genetic unit comprising structural genes and regulatory genes. The concept of the regulation of gene expression, extended to higher eukaryotes, makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of differentiation in cells with specific activities (muscle cells, nerve cells, epithelial cells\u2026) by the silencing of certain genes and the activation of others. Within the framework of bioenergetics, the chemiosmotic theory put forward by MITCHELL, in order to explain the coupling of mitochondrial respiration with ATP synthesis (Chapter IV-4.3), gave rise to consideration of the concepts of transmembrane transport of metabolites and of vectorial metabolism.",

The cell is no longer considered to be a bag of enzymes, as used to be the case. It is now considered to be a compartmented structure in which each type of compartment corresponds to a type of organelle delimited by a membrane and characterized by specific functions. Thus, because of the genetic material that is present in it, the nucleus of the cell holds the information necessary for the manufacture of proteins. The mitochondria, which are called cell power plants, are in charge of oxidizing the products of cell catabolism and using the resulting energy for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and mineral phosphate. The lysosomes are the garbage collectors of the cell. Among the functions carried out by peroxisomes is the partial breakdown of very long chain fatty acids. The endoplasmic reticulum and the GOLGI apparatus are involved in the maturation and the secretion of proteins. The ribosomes represent the machinery upon which messenger RNAs are displayed in order to be decoded into proteins. A sign of the extreme sophistication of this setup is that the membranes of the endocellular compartments are not sealed common walls. They contain proteins that act as selective transporters of metabolites or highly specific ion channels, allowing the exchange of messages throughout the cell. Thus, each organelle, informed of the condition of the others, is able to adjust its own activity to ensure the greatest harmony of the whole. This conditioned compartmentation at cell level may be compared to the socialization of human communities. While endocellular organelles are compartments delimited by membranes, there are non-membrane-bound compartments in the cell, such as protein complexes in which two, three or even more proteins are closely linked. Often, these are enzymes that catalyze reactions that are contiguous in a metabolic pathway. Being compacted into a complex known as a metabolon results in an increased efficiency of the flow of metabolites by facilitating the channeling of this flow.",

            "text": "Concepts evolve, often adjusting their representations according to accumulated knowledge. A good example of this is the evolution of the concept of the gene since its formulation at the beginning of the 20 th century. The term \"genetics\" was created in 1906 by the English naturalist William BATESON (1861 -1926) . The term \"gene\" was introduced three years later by the Dane Wilhelm JOHANNSEN. This term designated a principle which, in the chromosomes of fertilized egg, and in an intentionally vague manner, was supposed to have an influence on the phenotype of the progeniture. During the same period, the term \"locus\" appeared out of the experiments carried out by the American Thomas Hunt MORGAN on the drosophila, a locus being defined as a region of a chromosome which, when altered by a mutation, leads to a modification of the phenotype of the living organism. Based on cross-breeding experiments carried out on hundreds of drosophila mutants, MORGAN and his co-workers drew up the first genetic maps. By chance, the salivary glands of the drosophila have a particular characteristic; the nuclei of their cells contain giant chromosomes called polytenes, which result from the association of a hundred replicate copies of chromosomes that, after staining, are visible under the optical microscope. On these chromosomes, it is possible to distinguish colored bands separated by clear bands. It was observed that specific mutations had specific effects on the arrangement and number of these bands. The material contained in the bands was therefore the site of mutations. In the middle of the 1930s, the listing of more than 3 500 bands made it possible to construct a cytological map that was already highly detailed. The concept of the gene, the material basis of inheritance, took root. The sporadic mutagenic effect of X-radiation in the drosophila, which was shown by the geneticist and biophysicist Hermann M\u00dcLLER (1890 -1967), led the Austrian physicist Erwin SCHR\u00d6DINGER to question the sporadic event which, at the level of a target of a few dozen atoms, determines a mutation. He postulated that the target is located in the chromatin of the chromosomes, organized as an aperiodic crystal. The chemical nature of this target was identified with DNA, following bacterial transformation experiments (AVERY, MACLEOD and MCCARTHY, 1944) and experiments concerning bacterial infection by the bacteriophage (HERSHEY and CHASE, 1952) (Chapter IV-1.1.1). This is how the idea that gene = DNA was born.",

A first stumbling block appeared when it was shown that the activity of a gene, and in consequence its contribution to the phenotype, depends on nucleic elements outside the gene. The definition of the term \"gene\" was then extended to include promoting and regulatory sequences. In the case of the lac operon of Escherichia coli, these sequences are located just upstream of the site where transcription begins. However, in eukaryotes, a regulatory sequence may be distant from the gene that must be transcribed and sometimes it may be involved in the regulation of several genes (Chapter IV-1.1.1). In the 1970s, the idea of the existence of the mosaic gene in eukaryotes appeared. A gene was now thought of as an assembly of several exons that originally in the chromosome are separated by introns. The alternative splicing of these pieces of genes gives rise to numerous possibilities for reconstitution, i.e., many messages coding for many different proteins. Thus, however useful the concept of the gene has been with respect to its ability to generate discussion and to provoke experimentation concerning the molecular machinery responsible for the transmission of the hereditary characteristics, we can see that the term itself has not ceased to be the subject of readjustments, since the time it was first formulated.",

While some metaphorical concepts, particularly those that make use of images designed to grab the imagination, and to be easy to understand, tend to take liberties with the realities of living beings, they can also shed light on unsuspected mechanisms in sectors that have been neglected. Metaphorical concepts are not a current fashion. It should be remembered that in his Passions of the Soul (1649), DESCARTES, when asked \"how limbs can be moved by objects of the senses and by the mind without the help of the soul,\" responds that this takes place \"in the same way as the movement of a watch is produced only by the force of its spring and the arrangement of its cogs.\" Later on, with LAVOISIER's clear vision of the vital role of oxygen, and his comparison of respiration with combustion, the concept of the chemistry of life, combined with that of bioenergetics, came to the fore, and was at the heart of studies on the metabolism. Chemical reactions that liberate and absorb heat were substituted for the cogs of Cartesian mechanics. The second half of the 20 th century saw the birth and development of the concept of the program, a concept with computer technology connotations, which was destined to explain the phenomena of inheritance. This concept began to fill out from the moment when it became certain that, in its nucleotide sequence, DNA contains the necessary information for the construction of the protein material of cells. For a certain period of time, the passion for molecular genetics eclipsed the interest that had previously been given to metabolic chemistry. The powerfulness of the metaphorical concept may be measured according to the effect it has in pushing scientific research in particular directions, with the results this has on society. Thus, during the 17 th and 18 th centuries, the study of human pathology was impregnated with a strong iatromechanical current. Physiological chemistry and its corollary, pathological chemistry, which emerged as disciplines in their own right in the 19 th century and achieved full expansion in the 20 th century, are our inheritance from LAVOISIER and the concept of Discussion about concepts necessarily leads to a brief discussion of scientific semantics, as shown by the few examples given in the previous pages. As we have just seen, the word gene that was put forward by JOHANNSEN around one century ago did not have the same meaning at that time as it has now, a meaning that still remains fluid. The GMO, an acronym meaning Genetically Modified Organism, which has been the subject of vehement diatribes over the last few years, becomes much less of an object of passion if it is considered within the context of evolution. After all, for the last two to three billion years, living organisms have been genetically modified constantly by spontaneous mutations, which is why the human beings that we are today are able to discuss them! The term cloning is another example of a semantic misunderstanding that leads to inaccurate interpretation and arouses the passions. The primary meaning of the term cloning is the multiplication and the identical reproduction of a living cell. The simplest and most unambiguous example is that of bacterial cloning, a bacterial cell producing millions of cells that are identical to the original cell by its multiplication in a nutritive medium. The term animal reproductive cloning does not carry exactly the same semantic weight. It should be remembered that, in eukaryotes, the preliminary act of the cloning procedure involves the injection of the nucleus (with 2n chromosomes) from a somatic cell into an enucleated oocyte (Chapter IV-2.3.2; see also Chapter IV-6.1). The somatic cell nucleus, by providing its genetic equipment, gives the being that will develop in the uterus a phenotype that is practically identical to that of the somatic cell donor, but nevertheless not completely identical, as the cytoplasm of the enucleated ovum, with its mitochondria, provides a small but non-negligible fraction of genes, the mitochondrial genes. As for therapeutic cloning (in the absence of uterine implantation), this is used for the manufacture of differentiated cells that may be grafted into the individual who has donated the original somatic cell, with no immune-related rejection occurring. This is non-reproductive cloning. The passionate argument that has arisen because the term cloning is bandied about in an ill-considered fashion illustrates the confusion that can result from a lack of precision in the use of certain terms with a high level of media impact.",

As Ian HACKING (b. 1936) says in Representing and Intervening (1983), nowadays engineering, and not theorizing, is the greatest proof of scientific realism, which leads to the minimization of philosophical thought. In A Skeptical Biochemist (1992) , the Polish-born American biochemist Joseph FRUTON (1912 FRUTON ( -2007 emphasizes the contrast between the 19 th century and the first half of the 20 th century, when eminent scientists were still interested in the ideas of the professional philosophers of the history of the sciences concerning the progress of experimental research and, in contrast, the end of the 20 th century, when philosophy and the experimental sciences pretended to ignore one another. This is doubtless partly because the history of biology has become the history of biotechnologies to such an extent that, according to some, the objects being explored are so familiar that they are now part of the life of society. In Pandora's Hope (1999), Bruno LATOUR (b. 1947) considers that the current confrontation between subject and object, in which the researcher-subject explores the structure and function of the object, is being transformed into a human-nonhuman dialogue, in which the nonhuman-object becomes \"socialized\". Taking yeast as an example, LATOUR writes that it has been \"working for millenia in the brewing industry, but now it works in a network of thirty laboratories where its genome is mapped, humanized and socialized like a code, a book, or a program of action that is compatible with our ways of coding, counting and reading [\u2026] .

In the same spirit, the Belgian philosopher Gilbert HOTTOIS (b. 1946), in his Philosophies of the Sciences, Philosophies of techniques (2004) remarks that \"laboratories produce things that go off to live their lives in society and in Nature.\" Thus, bacteria, yeasts or genetically modified plants are able to produce drugs such as insulin, growth hormone and vaccines for human medicine. These drugs become part of and indispensable to life in society. They are evaluated according to their market value by the companies that patent, manufacture and sell them, and according to the comfort they bring to the patients to whom they are administered. The financial management that results from their consumption becomes a worry for those responsible for public health, while their manufacture by specialized companies generates industrial activity and economic growth which may be measured according to how fashionable they are and how they sell.",

However, evaluating risk involves not being afraid of it but understanding it in a lucid and courageous fashion.

Until recently, advances made in biology left moralists indifferent. This ceased to be the case when scientific experimentation began to look at the human embryo with a view to utilitarian ends in the health domain. The specter of cloning was brandished without any clear distinction being made between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. Biology became demonized. However, as biologist Pierre CHAMBON (b. 1931) said in an interview in the French journal Biofutur: \"In absolute terms, biology is unable to tell us whether the cloning of a human being is moral or immoral, it simply tells us whether it is biologically possible.\"",

Up until then, the biosciences had been happy just to try and understand the mechanisms that explained the functions of living beings, but now, with the advent of GMOs and cloning, it became obvious that a forbidden barrier had been crossed and that Man had the power not only to transform but also invent himself.

Even supposing that scientific progress will one day overcome these difficulties, human reproductive cloning will come up against an insurmountable obstacle, the cloned subject's fear of finding that he or she is identical to the relative from whom his or her genetic inheritance comes. After all, the notion of manipulation of the human ovule with the aim of serial reproduction has often haunted science fiction stories. In Brave New World (1932), Aldous HUXLEY (1894 -1963) gives an apocalyptic vision of the budding of human eggs that produce hundreds of identical twins which are conditioned into classes and subclasses while being raised in jars, depending on the quality of the nutritive substances they are given. In The Artificial Uterus (2005), Henri ATLAN (b. 1931) predicts that the raising of human fetuses in jars could well become an alternative to uterine gestation in a distant future. Let it be understood that human reproductive cloning, which is no longer part of the domain of science fiction, as it has become feasible, must be considered as being reprehensible because it goes beyond the limits of reason, and is a denial of human transcendence.

A graft of immunocompatible nerve cells might make it possible to re-establish nerve continuity.

Given the hopes that are raised by the possibility of such therapies, and the fact that, after all, such therapeutic cloning is the equivalent to an autograft, even if the ways in which the graft is obtained are slightly tortuous, the demonization and rejection of such practices should be reconsidered, calmly and coolly.",

It is interesting to note that in the 13 th century, THOMAS AQUINAS, The Father of the Church, had acknowledged that a fetus only becomes \"animated\" by the implantation of the soul by Holy Will in the third month after fertilization. Another subject to be considered is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), in which human embryos that have been fertilized in vitro are sorted in order to find those that are without defects, a practice which is on the verge of being a deviation in the direction of eugenics. Nevertheless, PGD is the basis of a practice that is either already legalized or is in the process of being so in several European countries, the creation of so-called designer babies. A typical example is that of a designer baby arising from an embryo whose immune profile to that of an older sibling who is suffering from leukemia.

In 1982, a patent concerning the growth hormone gene was awarded to the University of San Francisco. In 1984, the University of California at Berkeley obtained a patent for the human insulin gene. In 1985, the American company Pioneer Hi-Bred succeeded in patenting a variety of corn in which genetic modification has led to an increased synthesis of tryptophan, an amino acid that is indispensable for animal feed. In 1988, the Genentech company acquired a patent for the gene coding for human gamma interferon. This was followed in Japan by a patent for the gene coding for beta interferon. In the same year Harvard University patented the OncoMouse, a transgenic mouse whose susceptibility to cancer is greatly increased. After this, several species of transgenic animals were patented for utilitarian purposes, such as the production of human alpha-1-antitrypsin taken from the milk of transgenic goats and used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The frenetic patenting of living beings has reached the domain of natural products arising from the plant world in tropical regions, the immensely varied essences arising from these plants being full of pharmacological potential. The potential for producing drugs of a considerable commercial value from such plants is very high. Here we return to the problem of the patenting of genetically modified, cultivatable plants (GMPs) (Chapter IV-2.1). Thus, the experimental method, the principle of which is to acquire pure knowledge, finds itself led astray in its applications. Whatever the motives that are given, particularly for manipulations that give rise to the manufacture of marketable products, the patenting of genomes for mercantile ends shows the regrettable, but unfortunately inevitable, direction in which the very spirit of a science, molecular biology, which half a century ago wished to be at the heart of an understanding of living beings, has drifted.",

This desire to stop experimentation on animals ignores the imperatives of contemporary medicine, which must meet the challenge of pathologies whose increasing incidence is worrying, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and the degenerative illnesses that are linked with aging or are of genetic origin. It is true that animal experimentation inevitably leads to questions. Are the stakes involved in a particular experiment, in terms of the acquisition of new knowledge, worth the suffering of an animal used in that experiment? Is it not necessary to ensure that the experimental protocol is well-documented, that it is not redundant, or even that it has been the subject of previous studies carried out on cells in culture? It is easy to see the size of the methodological chasm that separates contemporary physiology from that of the time of Claude BERNARD, when cell culture techniques were not yet being used, when the main instrument used was the scalpel and the researcher, using his or her imagination and creativity, had to develop specific protocols that were able to validate or refute a working hypothesis. Each period in history operates in its own way according to its moral laws and its technical capabilities. The bloody operations carried out by MAGENDIE and by Claude BERNARD in the 19 th century, which were tolerated at this time despite criticisms from antivivisectionists, would not be permitted today. Nevertheless, it is true that the physiologists of the 19 th century, by means of the results of their experiments, wove a tapestry of new knowledge on which contemporary biologists were going to work and without which the level of understanding the modern science would be much lower than it is.",

The efficacy of this policy in the life sciences may be judged by the number of researchers who have won Nobel prizes since the second world war (at the time of writing, more than 80 in the USA and twenty or so in Great Britain as opposed to only 4 in France).",

Equivalent bodies exist in countries other than France, some of them being institutes that are dedicated solely to research, and some being university laboratories that associate research and teaching. At the beginning of the 20 th century, the function of researcher was most often associated with that of a professor occupying a chair at a University, surrounded by a few assistants, the professor directing the research work in his area of specialization. Now, within a period of a few decades, the status of researcher has been modified greatly. Today we talk of research careers classified according to level of expertise and technicality. Management, or the supervision of career paths and the control of financing, is carried out by an administration that is itself highly hierarchical. The scientific process has undergone a metamorphosis, shown by changes in the behavior of researchers not only within the institutions in which they work but also in their relationships with the media, the political sphere and society. The teaching of the life sciences needs to take this into account.",

Such times are past, and the researchers of today often like to make us believe that they only find what they are looking for. The thousands of pages PASTEUR's lab books provide an opportune reminder to us (and to program-makers or impatient users) that it is just as difficult to ask a question as to answer it, that a scientific discovery often occurs after a long, winding path, that rather than following the fashion, it is preferable to follow one's ideas, particularly if they are good ones, and are in advance of the fashion.\" Jean JACQUES Molecular Dissymmetry, in \"PASTEUR, Workbooks of a Scholar\" -1995 Current technological progress, the accumulation of the scientific knowledge, the institutionalization of the public research and many other factors are disrupting a ritual of the experimental process that had survived until the middle of the 20 th century, and even beyond.

Short-term objectives, considered to be \"visible\", are favored. A priori, the viability of a project is judged according to the scientific context of the period and its impact on society, insofar as the project looks at health problems with a high degree of media coverage (cancer, degenerative illnesses, viral infections\u2026) and often in agreement with a consensus that avoids going against the orthodoxy of the moment. This leads to a rigid management of projects that are financed and controlled according to objectives that have been fixed in advance, and that are all the more easily accepted by state authorities when they are somewhat fantastic in character. However, fundamental research proceeds from a playful activity, and for this reason, its efficacy is dependent on the passion of the researcher for the problem that he or she is studying. In contrast to what is believed by the narrow-minded, the effectiveness of a researcher in terms of discoveries depends upon the liberty that is given to this researcher, assuming, of course, that this liberty is underpinned by criteria of confidence such as the researcher's scientific past, his or her motivation, and judgements made concerning the researcher by impartial peers. It should not be forgotten that the determination of the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin by Max PERUTZ (Chapter III-6.2.1) took around twenty years of solitary, uninterrupted and untiring labor.

Such a person knows that the pathways to discovery are convoluted, and that an inexplicable observation that appears unexpectedly during an experiment can sometimes, if the researcher is sufficiently perspicacious, be the beginning of an adventure that leads to a discovery. It was to just such a convoluted path that the Belgian biologist Christian DE DUVE (b. 1917) alluded in his speech when he received the NOBEL prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1974. After working at the University of Saint Louis in the USA, DE DUVE, who had taken up a post at the University of Louvain, Belgium, decided to look at a research theme that had received a great deal of media coverage, diabetes and insulin. It was while operating on one of the subcellular fractions obtained from ground rat's liver, and analyzing certain of the enzyme activities of these fractions, that he was surprised to find, in one of them, enriched with mitochondria, a phosphatase activity that, paradoxically, increased with time, while the enzyme activities specific to the mitochondria declined. This was an activity belonging to organelles that were contaminating the mitochondria. Dropping all research on diabetes, DE DUVE set out to identify and characterize these unknown organelles. He discovered that they were involved in the breakdown (lysis) of molecules that are undesired by the cell and, for this reason, he called them lysosomes. The discovery of lysosomes helped to open a new chapter in cell biology and to attribute a molecular cause to diseases with serious prognoses whose etiology had remained a mystery up until then. These diseases were given the label lysosomal diseases. These diseases result from the absence of a lysosomal enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of a given metabolite. The accumulation of this non-broken-down metabolite in the lysosomes leads to cell malfunction, which causes the lysosomal disease. As DE DUVE said jokingly, if he had carefully followed the experimental process laid down in his diabetes research project, and if he had not given way to the temptation of \"playing hooky\" or \"playing truant\" he would never have mounted the podium in Stockholm. In the same way, Henri-G\u00e8ry HERS 84 (1923 -2008), a cell pathologist at the internationally renowned Louvain school, remarked in an article published in the review M\u00e9decine/Sciences: \"I believe we would obtain maximum value for the money devoted to research if we were willing to distribute it to those who have been shown to be productive, according to their needs, and without asking them for a program.\" HERS concluded, in a tone that was deliberately playful, but thought-provoking, \"such a simple system would lead to unemployment for a large number of administrators, which is why I suspect that it will never be adopted.\"",

Intelligence is measured according to the rapidity and depth of understanding and clearness of expression. It may be measured and even given a numerical value. The same is not true for the imagination, a more subtle, unmeasurable phenomenon that cannot be learned. The imagination is one of the levers that is able to lift the boulder that hides scientific truth. The imagination is the ultimate weapon of research, which shakes up the knowledge acquired by the intelligence.

Here again, media coverage has quietly infiltrated the scene. Its role is all the more perverse in that the rating of a publication is estimated according to its impact index, or, roughly speaking, the renown of the scientific journal in which it is published. Curiously, it has happened that articles that would later be considered to be of primary importance have been rejected by highly prestigious journals, simply because the facts mentioned in the article and the conclusions made have not coincided with the orthodox opinions of the period and the traditionalist spirit of the journal's editorial committee. This was the case for an article which the biochemist Hans KREBS (1900 KREBS ( -1980 submitted to the British journal Nature in 1937. In this article KREBS described a series of experiments showing that an endocellular metabolite, pyruvate, product of glycolysis, is completely degraded during a cycle of enzyme reactions. This degradation cycle would later be recognized as the central pivot of the intermediate metabolism. Called upon to judge revolutionary scientific considerations, and unable to perceive their importance, Nature's editorial committee rejected the article. KREBS then sent his article to a journal with a relatively restricted audience, Enzymologia. It was accepted and published in the two months that followed. The importance of the concept that was put forward in the article ensured that its author gained international recognition, leading to his winning the NOBEL prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1953.",

From being the work of individuals, research has become collective. In domains whose complexity requires a wide selection of techniques that may range from physics to genetics, the hybridization of specific areas of expertise is certainly indispensable, and this requires the collaboration on a particular project of researchers who are sometimes physically remote from one another.

A century ago, fundamental research and technological research interacted all the more directly because they were both in their infancy. This is no longer the case. Management of the ever-increasing amount of knowledge in the life sciences, and the degree of sophistication achieved by bioengineering techniques and instruments, is widening a gap that makes dialogue increasingly laborious. However, dialogue appears to be a guarantee of future progress. The solution can only come from an increase in cross-disciplinarity, which should begin with university teaching and the establishment of a recruitment policy that advocates the cohabitation of talents from different educational backgrounds in the same laboratory. Fortified by such hybrid expertise, while maintaining its share of originality and liberty in the choice of problems to be studied, fundamental research on living beings can only be enriched by a marriage of reason with biotechnology. Convinced of the necessity for such a marriage, Stanley FIELDS, the inventor of the double hybrid method (Chapter IV-4.1), in an article entitled \"The interplay of Biology and Technology\" (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 2001, vol. 98, pp. 10051-10054), concludes,: \"It is at the interfaces of biology and other sciences that many of the future discoveries will be made, at the interfaces of biology and engineering that these discoveries will come to be exploited, and at the interfaces of biology and ethics and law that their consequences for society will be decided.\"",

This is where the twin demons of money and power raise their heads. Already, at the turn of the 1980s, A. Bartlett GIAMATTI 86 (1938 -1989) , who was then president of Yale University in the USA, commenting on American university policies, spoke of a \"ballet of antagonisms\" between, on the one hand, commercial companies that are interested in the rapid cost-effectiveness of any new therapeutic advance and, on the other hand, non-profit university laboratories. Recently, James J. DUDERSTADT 87 (b. 1973), emeritus President of the University of the Michigan, argued that the University is a \"counter-hierarchical\" organism. In fact, its members are free to carry out the research that pleases them and to think in the ways that they wish to think, in any case within an academic norm that considers itself as being free from the constraints dictated by private interest groups. Until recently, such behavior was considered as a sort of ethic which arose out of the University conscience and dignity. The crumbling away of this ethic in the final decades of the 20 th century coincided with the rise of biotechnologies and the large-scale filing of patents relating to molecular genetics techniques that could be applied to the manipulation of living beings, by researchers in the public sector. The intrusion of the American private sector into public research laboratories, in the form of collaborations with transfer of \"sensitive\" information from the public to the private, has become such a worrying problem that drastic control measures have had to be taken. Within this context, the American federal government, in February 2005, issued a certain number of prohibitions targeting the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of Bethesda, particularly with respect to the retribution of researchers for services rendered to industry 88 . These stands call for thought concerning the place that is currently held in Universities with respect to fundamental research. Without arguing against the efficacy of major research institutes, it is nevertheless necessary to remember the part played by the University in this domain. The University is not only the place where knowledge, both as it is now, in its current state of advancement, and as it has been, it is also the place where knowledge must be created by fundamental research.",

The methods and instruments developed by the biotechnosciences have led to profound modifications in the ways that the structures and functions of living beings are investigated. For example, by varying multiple parameters in DNA chips or protein chips, at the same time, the experimenter is able to ask questions that lead to grouped all-or-nothing answers (Chapter IV-1.1.3). In combinatory chemistry, screening makes it possible to detect a molecule that is active for a given pathology from among a multitude of molecules (Chapter IV-3.4). The mathematical simulation of metabolic networks or of signaling chains is already well under way (Chapter IV-4.2). Given this new technological outlook and the hope that it can provide rapid solutions to health problems subject to considerable media coverage, the teaching of biology in universities must not be limited to a description of current advances, no matter how brilliant and promising they may be. This teaching should return to its origins, be a reminder of history, and should not hesitate to use examples to illustrate how a major discovery can arise from a long period of wandering in the wilderness. In practical terms, while being conscious of the extraordinary complexity of living nature, and carefully avoiding the dangers of simplification, it is important to remember that the reductionist method was a necessary path to an understanding of the integrated, modelized biology that is emerging nowadays. At present, certain people call reductionism naive, but this is only the case insofar as we have faith in recent advances in integrated biology 89 . With this in mind, it should be noted that the deciphering of the protein synthesis mechanism in prokaryotic microorganisms (Chapter IV-1.1.1) was, along with the discovery of the genetic code, a jumping-off point for an inventory of similar, but noticeably more sophisticated, mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms. The reductionist \"one gene, one enzyme\" dogma, formulated on the basis of BEADLE and TATUM's experiments on the mold Neurospora crassa (Chapter III-6.1) was a necessary prerequisite to a considerably more elaborate understanding of the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype. The way in which the nucleic acid and protein units in the tobacco mosaic virus spontaneously organize themselves (Chapter III-7.3) acted as a basis for thought concerning the self-organization of macromolecular complexes in the cell. These few examples underline the fact that it is difficult to comprehend the scientific research process if we only refer to experiments carried out in the present, and if we do not have a clear idea not only of the way in which hypotheses, even false ones, were once formulated, but also of the way in which experimental work, which may have led to failures, was once carried out, or, in brief, if we do not look back at the past. Let us add that it is occasionally good for us to show some humility when we take the trouble to examine the past. Thus, the processes involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria by innate immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages), which are today studied in the greatest detail with particularly refined technical facilities, had already been perceived more than a century ago by METCHNIKOFF, and even analyzed, admittedly with the clumsy means at his disposal, but with such accuracy that none of the conclusions formulated at that time have yet been disproved (Chapters III-2.2.4 and III-6.2.5).",

If we look at the pharmaceutical industry in particular, we see that only half a century ago the pharmacopeia was limited to plant extracts or active agents isolated from these plants, with antibiotics quietly beginning to make their appearance. In the last decades of the 20 th century, a great technological leap forward was made, with completely new methods in bioengineering, combinatory chemistry, and the finding of therapeutic targets in macromolecules, and this created a hiatus that severely handicapped countries that were unprepared for it. France, with its biological fundamental research training that is out of phase with that of the Anglo-Saxon countries, fell behind, and continues to be behind, a situation that is prejudicial for its economy. The remedy for this does not lie in incantatory speeches. It requires a volontarist policy for the management of experimental research. Generally speaking, the fact that the major engineering schools in France, which recruit the scientific intellectual elite, students being chosen by competitive exams that select for intelligence rather than imagination, are unable to impose upon their students an end-of-course thesis that would authenticate their engineering degree, should not be tolerated. In contrast to other countries, in France only a small percentage of engineers have received doctoral training or had to present a thesis before entering their careers. The French dual system of major engineering schools and universities, which, a century ago, made sense for the economy of that period, has become completely obsolete, and deserves a courageous revision.",

            "text": "The last decades of the 20 th century represented the utilitarian era of molecular biology. The introduction of genetic engineering into biological experimentation dates to the beginning of the 1970s. It was at this time that techniques were developed that made it possible to transfer a fragment of genomic DNA from one species into the genome of another species. Genetic engineering now fills a predominant position in the Life Sciences, supported by increasingly effective biocomputing or bioinformatics techniques. It is easy to understand that expertise and a high degree of knowledge about fundamental research is necessary in order to be able to master or even invent the genetic engineering techniques that are indispensable if we are going to produce biomolecules with a therapeutic impact, such as those that are currently being used in the pharmaceutical domain: insulin, growth hormone, blood coagulation factors, vaccines, etc. The engineering sciences that make up the greater part of contemporary biotechnology have now come to the fore in many domains of the Life Sciences. It is thus that a modernistic and original way of investigating Nature has come into being. A multiparametric model, in which biocomputing or bioinformatics and high-throughput screening reign, is added to, or even substituted for, the Bernardian model for the experimental method, based on observation, an a priori hypothesis, and experimentation to verify this hypothesis by varying a single parameter at a time. The aim of this globalized approach is to integrate the multiple reactions that take place almost simultaneously in different locations of a cell into a coherent whole, to rationalize the interpretation of the dialogue that operates between the different endocellular organelles, and finally to discover how the exchanges of information between cells in an organ and between organs in multicellular organisms are set up. We are therefore witness to the emergence of an integrated biology that has been labeled \"systems biology\". Its long-term objective is to model the functioning of living beings and to theorize them. Its development is encouraged by the perspective of consequences that could revolutionize certain sectors of the human economy and of public health. Today, concrete, mechanical models, in the form of biorobots and hybrid robots, and, very recently, molecular motors are added to abstract models that are based on the logic of mathematics and algorithms, ushering in the era of nanobiomachines. Becoming more utilitarian, the life sciences are imperceptibly detaching themselves from traditional philosophical concepts that try to explain the modes of reasoning of the researcher, or even to impose a framework for thought that is likely to orient his or her way of doing research.",

There has never been such a real divorce between the world of phenomena that are understood by the experimenter and the world of noumena whose intelligibility is foreign to our senses. There has never been such a wide gap between the biotechnosciences, whose possibilities are coming to be seen as limitless, and a reflective analysis of thought, which wanders between freedom of action and prohibition.",

Elsewhere, the cognitive sciences that are bringing together philosophy and psychology in the domains of computer technology and artificial intelligence, and which are tackling the processes of thought, the creative imagination and memory, will no doubt be the subject of the considerable questioning concerning research on living beings with which the experimental method will be confronted in the 21 st century.",

At present, the challenge has been partially met, but a great deal remains to be done. Innumerable cargoes have already reached port, but what will be the destiny of this precious merchandise? After all, the seeds of the idea of technoscience were already in place in the 17 th century, in the philosophy of Francis BACON and Robert BOYLE (Chapter II-6). BACON recommended that the governments of the time promote experimental science by the creation of laboratories equipped with high-performance instruments and libraries, by the organization of researchers into teams and by appropriate financing. The utilitarian ends of scientific research were underlined. BOYLE imagined a situation in which laboratories were open to society and researchers were able to accept criticism. Given innovations that upset tradition, protestations arose. The pneumatic machine or vacuum pump was the subject of the fameuse diatribe between BOYLE and the philosopher HOBBES (Chapter II-6.2). HOBBES criticized the validity of BOYLE's conclusions, drawn from experiments that he qualified as doubtful. Following his words, he came to see in the discoveries of experimental science a possible threat to the power of governments and the hierarchical layout of society. Such overcautious opposition to the pursuit of knowledge is in no way anecdotal, it is still a reality, with the uprooting of genetically modified plants and the veto that has been placed in certain areas on stem cell research. This type of opposition is also shown when pressures or even vetoes are in operation that take into account more the opportunism of the moment than an in-depth understanding of science and of its history and that forget that freedom of the mind is a guarantee of its creativity, because, just as in the world of Arts and Letters, the world of Scientific Research is situated outside those norms that can be modulated by state decrees. The creativity of the researcher cannot be manufactured on demand. Where it exists, it still needs to be detected and encouraged.",

The simulation encom-passed the different phases of the infection of the enterobacterium E. coli by the bacteriophage T7. This infection involves the translocation of the bacteriophage DNA into the bacterium, the replication of this DNA in the body of the bacterium and the bacterium's own protein synthesis machinery being diverted to the production of bacteriophages (Chapter III-6.1). In order to model the infection of E. coli by phage T7, the genome of the phage was divided into 73 numbered segments, each segment representing one part of the genome. The modeling took into account the translocation of the viral DNA into the bacterium, the transcription of the viral DNA into messenger RNAs (mRNA) and the translation of the messenger RNAs into viral proteins. It used measurement values taken from experiments carried out in vivo, such as those concerning the kinetic constants of various enzyme reactions involved in virus proliferation. It was observed that, depending on whether the RNA polymerase is of bacterial or viral origin, the speed of transcription is 40 or 200 base pairs per second. By carrying out virtual mutations involving the in silico permutation of the order of the genes in the bacteriophage genome, for example the position of the gene coding for the RNA polymerase, researchers observed a slowing down of the replication of the bacteriophage that is practically equivalent to that measured in vivo. They came to the conclusion that the",
