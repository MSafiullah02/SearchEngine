These lizard\u2019s squirt a stream of blood from the corner of the eye as a novel defense strategy. I was in love. The park rangers visiting our house would tell stories of toads and ants in the region, they convinced me to let the lizard go free. A park naturalist showed me how to lure an ant lion from his sandy cone with a blade of grass. The enthusiasm for living things and excitement adults expressed over this special place established a foundation for my life in science.",

One of the first few days after arrival, I caught a snake in the desert just outside our house. I instinctively avoided the head so I carried the snake by its tail. I had no idea what kind of snake I had, in fact I did not know there were different kinds of snake. I brought the snake home to show to the family. A new discovery was that my brother expressed severe anxiety over the snake and my proximity to him, he ran. I then discovered my mother also shared a deep fear of snakes. They encouraged me to let the snake go free but the incident was not complete until I got a snake lecture from the park naturalist. The impromptu lecture was amazing; we looked at about a half-dozen different snakes in glass enclosures including the local rattlesnake. The concept of an animal capable of delivering a poison was mind expanding.",

My parents concern for my explorations centered on my lack of social development. They began exploring boarding school options for my brother and I but we stayed to attend our one-room school. Monsoon-like rains arrived late in the spring leaving pools of water in the barren clay soil. My brother and I found a muddy pool filled with hundreds of tadpoles, possibly the canyon treefrog (Hyla arenicolor) . We watched these tadpoles mature over a two-week period and all were gone, buried in the mud, when the pool dried up. The desert provides numerous examples unique life and resilience strategies.",

I added catfish to the aquarium to reduce the algae but they did not completely remove the green haze from the glass. I added snails and more living plants and found the algae problem solved. An early lesson in the living interplay, ecology. The 9th grade scientist in me and availability of a plastic sphere inspired an idea of a self-contained ecological system. Gravel in the bottom, living plants, snails, and two fish were added to the fresh water system. I cut a hole in the top so a rubber stopper with a glass pipe could allow for pressure equalization. Those fish were still alive in an algae free plastic sphere after two years when I had to take the experiment apart. I see it is now possible to purchase self-sustained aquaria on the internet, confirmation that this is routinely accomplished. These self-sustained systems represent a robust demonstration of the balance of nature.",

Kassel, a recent Cornell University Ph.D. under the direction of R. H. Whittaker. Steve wanted to exploit the marriage of computer science and ecology. He divided the environment of Glacier National Park into six continuous \u201cgradients\u201d including: elevation, topographical-moisture and aspect, primary succession (soil development following glacial retreat), watershed location, alpine wind-snow exposure, and time since the last forest fire (Kessell 1976). My job was as part of the Northern Forest Fire Lab for data collection to measure species diversity and fire fuel loading. The data from several teams including mine supported the computer model, which would predict forest-fire burn area, anticipate resulting plant and animal communities, and support fire management decisions in the park.",

The job involved weekly backpacking trips to most regions of Glacier National Park and measuring plant diversity, an obligate lesson in taxonomy.

The project evaluated the ecology around Strawberry Reservoir during the summer after graduation (Worley et al. 1977). The objective was to use aquatic invertebrates as indicator species including: caddisfly (rock rollers), stonefly nymphs, mayflies, amphipods, damselflies, midges and worms as indicators of pollution in the area. We repeatedly sampled the creeks and streams leading into (Trout, Co-op, Indian, Horse, Clyde, and Soldier Creek) and out of (Strawberry River) Strawberry Reservoir to assess the impact of recreational and agricultural uses of the area. The reservoir had been managed for 50 years by the Strawberry Water Users Association and significant problems developed. Fishing villages and campsites were established with variations of pit toilets within feet of the shoreline and these sites were to be inundated by an enlarged Strawberry Reservoir. The reservoir filled to capacity in 1975 when a series of wet years led to the first spill over since 1952 and high water inundated many trailers, outdoor toilets, and other facilities. The flood problems were associated with water quality concerns for undesirably high nutrient levels. The project supported plans to improve management of the area to ensure water quality and future safe recreational use of Strawberry Reservoir. The lessons from undergraduate research clearly pointed to humans as part of the environment and our influence on ecology. This raises a contemplative question, Are we to live in harmony with the environment or are we adversaries?",

Marty\u2019s lab developed a red blood cell preparation to deliver macromolecules including tRNA into cultured eukaryotic cells. I was fortunate to experience this laboratory atmosphere and the cellular and molecular biology environment in the Biology Department which included respected molecular biologists; Drs. Gordon Lark (plant DNA expert), David Wolstenholm (mitochondrial DNA expert), Mario Capecci (Nobel Prize winner and gene transfer authority), and Baldimore Olivera (cone-shell toxin expert). My project involved SV40 virus and explored transformation in contrast to lytic infection in mammalian cells. The hypothesis was that mouse 3 T3 cells transformed with SV40 virus (SV3T3 cells) was due to failure of the virus to synthesize \u201clate\u201d proteins due to lack of specific iso-accepting tRNAs. I isolated tRNA from lytic TC7 African Green Monkey cells then loading the tRNA into red blood cells that were then fused to SV3T3 cells delivering tRNAs. We expected the SV3T3 cells to release SV40 virus into the medium but our hypothesis was incorrect (Schlegel et al. 1978). A second project involved using Sendai virus (a paramyxovirus) to fuse mouse 3 T3 cells with human HeLa cells to create mouse: human hybrid cells. I then observed the kinetics of chromosome loss as the hybrid cell line divided. I became expert at preparing metaphase spreads on microscope slides. The key observation was that mouse chromosomes, identified by their epicentric V shape, are maintained in favor of human chromosomes, identified by their metacentric X shape. The concept that the cell discards redundant genomic information is a novel rapid adaptation to changes in the cell.",

The department was famous due to the Chairman emeritus, Dr. Louis Goodman, the author of the blue bible, \u201cThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics.\u201d Utah and the Mormon culture offered a refuge for Goodman, a talented Jewish man, in the late 1930\u2019s when such ethnicity was discriminated against in the years leading up to World War II. Dr. Partlow was a cellular neuroscientist, a specialty of great personal interest. We dissected 12-day chicken embryos to remove sympathetic ganglia from adjacent to the spinal cord, a technique requiring steady hands and a stereo microscope in a sterile hood. Alternately, I removed the dorsal root ganglia rom the spinal cord to recover cholinergic tissue. Once the surgery was complete, the tissues was digested to produce a single cell suspension that was then subjected to intermittent vibration so the glial cells would attach to the culture dish leaving the neurons in suspension. I developed innovative strategies to encourage neurons to adhere to the culture dish enabling studies of pure primary neuronal cultures (Iversen et al. 1981). I became expert at measuring acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and carbonic anhydrase enzyme activities. I conducted experiments with the neurons separate from glial cell populations and then mixed them to evaluate neuronal-glial cell-cell interactions (Hanson et al. 1982).",

            "text": "I joined the laboratory of Dr. Franklin, younger energetic faculty member, and investigated the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system and drug metabolism. This family of enzymes were important to drug companies because they frequently inactivated drugs by oxidative metabolism. In addition, these enzymes metabolize a wide variety of foreign substrates, xenobiotics, from the environment and in some cases; the metabolic products are chemically reactive as radical cations. The reactive products form chemical bonds with cellular molecules including DNA, which link them to mutations and chemical carcinogenesis. The CYP enzymes reside in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and their metabolic action transforms highly lipid soluble substrates capable of long residence in cellular membranes into more water-soluble products that are carried out of the cell and out of the body. The CYP oxidations represent an energy efficient reaction in contrast to reduction reactions, which highlight the need for cells to manage energy utilization. The cellular content of CYP enzymes is reduced when the cell goes through the cell cycle suggesting a functional connection between CYP and growth. My dissertation investigated the expression of multiple CYP enzymes in the rat liver as it regenerates following partial hepatectomy (Iversen et al. 1985). We knew there were multiple genes encoding CYP enzymes but we did not know how many and reagents were not available to evaluate specific CYP genes. Linking chemicals in the environment to metabolic enzymes provides a fertile area directly linking gene-expression to the environment.",

Dr. Bresnick was an aggressive scientist exploring the molecular biology of the CYP enzymes with interest in details of chemical carcinogenesis. I participated in a project to explore the molecular biology of mouse cytochrome P450c, now known as CYP1a1 (Hines et al. 1985). My project quickly turned using the mouse gene as a probe to find and clone the human version of CYP1A1. The group effort was successful in isolating the first gene encoding a human drug-metabolizing enzyme. I spent 9 months subcloning and sequencing this gene (Iversen et al. 1987), a task that would take hours today. The molecular biology of CYP1A1 was exciting, rapidly expanding scientific questions that exceeded my capacity to conduct studies. Ed was an outstanding mentor but his responsibilities as director of the Eppley Institute diminished the time we could meet. Dr. Ron Hines was a new investigator at the institute having recently completed his postdoctoral fellowship with Ed and I relied on Ron as my mentor for the remainder of my postdoctoral fellowship. Reagents and expression vectors were rapidly becoming commercially available and served to expand perspectives in molecular biology and pharmacology. New techniques including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and automated DNA synthesizers and sequencers dramatically enhanced the pace of our research.",

I combined the essence of molecular biology with pharmacology in the exploration of antisense inhibitors of gene expression. The concept that a short single-stranded DNA molecule could be synthesized to bind to its complementary single-stranded RNA transcript to inhibit translation had the potential to lead to a vast new area of pharmacology. My friend, Dr. Mario Stevenson, was growing the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) in cell culture and we decided to collaborate on a project to use antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit HIV-1 viral growth (Stevenson and Iversen 1989). I then worked with a group at the NIH to reveal the sulfur modified DNA oligomer inhibited the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity independent of the oligomer sequence (Egan et al. 1991). An emerging belief that antisense oligomers could be RNA-based drugs became the focus of my future research.",

I was convinced a synthetic oligonucleotide would distribute into multiple organs but would it inhibit targeted gene expression? I investigated multiple gene targets for inhibition in animal models including a mouse tumor model of chronic myelogenous leukemia (Skorski et al. 1994)) and rat models of CYP2B1 (Desjardins et al. 1995) and CYP3A2 (Desjardins and Iversen 1995). With feasibility and in vivo efficacy completed, I explored the potential therapeutic limitations; finding a cardiovascular toxicity (Cornish et al. 1993) and reactive metabolite adduct formation from small molecule therapeutics (Copple et al. 1995). These limitations define a fulcrum in the risk to benefit balance for a patient with a lethal leukemia. I worked with a group at UNMC to investigate an antisense inhibitor of p53, an overexpressed gene in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; (Bayever et al. 1993a)). I directed the effort to prepare an investigational new drug (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and gained permission to proceed to conduct the first evaluation of a systemically administered synthetic oligonucleotides in humans (Bayever et al. 1993b). The first-in-human milestone with antisense led to an international press release, which aired, on CNN International in 1992. The appearance of my name in the interview process led to a request from King Hussain of Jordan to treat his lymphoma as well as hundreds of requests to treat patients with this emerging technology. The international recognition of my accomplishment supported my promotion to full professor, resulted in numerous invitations to present these first-ever clinical observations, and a position on the national board of directors of the Leukemia Society of America. I participated in the creation of a new biotechnology company, Lynx, as a spin off from Applied Biosystems and prepared IND documents for antisense targeting in collaboration with Bruno Callebretta at Thomas Jefferson University, with Andrew Zalewski at Thomas Jefferson University, and in collaboration with Alan Gewertz at the University of Pennsylvania. My research effort for each of these projects involved firsthand experience with the concept of translating synthetic DNA into a drug product by exploiting the questions of dose, dose interval, route of administration, and dose limitations by conducting the first pharmacokinetic and preclinical toxicology studies.",

I looked at the radical oxygen production in a V79 cell line selecting for cells capable of growing in 6-thioguanine (HGPRT\u2212/\u2212) as well as oubain (Na/K ATPase \u2212/\u2212) and identified enhanced mutagenesis frequency. Later studies with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) compounds did not produce this radical oxygen response. While I felt publication of this mutagenesis activity was important, I was not able to convince our regulatory affairs people to explore this further for fear of finding something we did not want to know. An extension of this limitation was in the role of GLP studies in which contract research organizations do not recommend non-traditional mutagenesis assays in part due to lack of validated V79 cell lines. Mutagenesis assays are generally done with no intent to understand the process and the FDA does not demand much of these assays since they have some difficulty determining how to interpret the data. Basically, don\u2019t ask and don\u2019t tell until something arises in treated humans. While these off-target effects might be acceptable in the treatment of life threatening disease, the PSO as DNA chemistry would not be appropriate for the broad evaluation of genome function.",

The PMO are steric blockers and the hypothesis was that they would be less potent due to their lack of a catalytic mechanism of action such as RNAse H, RNAse P, or RISC. The PMO were significantly more potent inhibitors and more sequence selective.

The CYP enzymes are generally suppressed during infection, a response that is rapid and observed after viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection. The hypothesis is that an endogenous CYP substrate is an inhibitor of DNA and RNA polymerases and suppression of CYP activity means elevated concentrations of endogenous inhibitor- a protective response. Aphidicolin, a fungal diterpenoid compound, is a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase and a potential valuable anti-cancer agent but it is rapidly metabolized by CYP enzymes. The hypothesis is that various polymerases are linked to biological molecules in the environment and the CYP family modulate that activity. The diterpenes are chemically diverse with broad biological activity. Are these activities modulated by CYP expression? Can environmental exposure to chemical congeners disrupt the modulation?

Hence, much of the key information from GWAS has been overlooked inadvertently, as many variants are found in noncoding regions or unannotated regions of the genome (St. Laurent et al. 2014). Non-coding RNA (Table 1.1) can be divided into long non-coding RNA, lncRNA, and small non-coding RNA. The small ncRNA include: (1) miRNAs that are 18\u201321 nt in length and are involved in regulation of gene expression, (2) siRNA that are 21 nt segments that regulate gene expression and transposon activity, (3) rasiRNA are 24\u201327 nt that help form centromeres and orient heterochromatin, (4) piRNA or piwi-interacting RNA are 26\u201330 nt molecules that regulate transposon activity and chromatin, (5) snoRNA are 60\u2013300 nt in length that create 2\u2019-O-methyl and pseudo uridylation modifications of other RNAs, and (6) snRNAs that are 100\u2013300 nt which are involved in assembly of the spliceosome and nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of pre-mRNA (Dogini et al. 2014). lncRNA are a novel class of functional RNAs that impinge on gene regulation involving recruitment of epigenetic modifier proteins, control of mRNA decay and DNA sequestration of transcription factors. The human genome appears to produce over 60,000 lncRNA , the majority expressed at low levels. Early examples of trans-acting lncRNAs are inhibitory polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and the activating Trithorax/MLL chromatin modifiers HOTAIR and HOTTIP. The lncRNome contains cis-acting enhancer elements (eRNAs) which control the expression of neighboring protein coding genes. A lncRNA mediating alternative splicing via assembly of serine/arginine splicing factors within subnuclear components called speckles, MALAT1, is retained in the nucleus. A lncRNA called TINCR binds to the 3\u2019-UTR and elicits Staufen-mediated decay (SMD; (Kornfeld and Bruning 2014)).",

The Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_2 looks at how human populations spontaneously expand into niche boundaries exposing us to threats that drive the resilience process. The inevitable expansion beyond boundaries is termed \u201csocial entropy\u201d since seeking life beyond boundaries is a fact of life. Resilience means life is often threatened but it is not fragile. Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_3 focuses on infectious disease, particularly emerging infectious single-stranded RNA viruses, as the most significant threat to human health. I review antiviral drugs including personal experiences with antiviral drug discovery and development. Viral genomes are sensitive to environmental conditions and have become resilience experts and evolution is mediated by RNA sequence plasticity . Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_4 describes \u201cnonlinear anomalies\u201d to highlight limitations in predicting the human outcome based on research studies with cells in culture and animal models.

Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_5 focuses on bacterial infections and their diverse threat to human health. I include a brief review of antibacterial drugs and personal experience with bacterial resilience mediated by horizontal gene transfer. Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_6 shifts focus to cancer as a threat to human health. Personal experience in discovery of novel therapeutics for the treatment of leukemia forms the body of the chapter. The spontaneous resolution of AML in children with Down syndrome highlights human resilience and the foundation for optimism in finding a cure to leukemia. Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_7 is a review of chemicals in the environment as a threat to human health. Brief examples of chemical carcinogenesis are included to illustrate how chemicals disrupt genomes. Historic research ignored RNA damage as a transient an irrelevant consequence of chemically induced nucleic acid damage.

Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_8 describes a key mediator of resilience, the immune response, as a threat recognition system and response via diverse RNA expression. Research into oligonucleotides designed to suppress specific RNA to manipulate the immune response including strategies to induce exon-skipping are described. Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_9 describes a parallel threat recognition and response system in the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of enzymes. The interesting observation that infections modulate CYP expression points to a role parallel to the immune response. CYP expression includes diverse splice variants that are largely uncharacterized. I propose metabolic clearance of small molecules as a metabolic companion to the immune system. Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_10 highlights the diversity in RNA expressed from a single gene.
