The lymphatics also have a significant ability to reabsorb large protein molecules and fluid. Any disruption or alterations of these mechanisms may lead to a pleural effusion.Fluid moves via a net filtration gradient from the parietal pleura capillaries into the pleura, while fluid is reabsorbed generally by parietal pleural lymphatics.The function of the pleural fluid is to decrease friction between the parietal and visceral pleura during respiration, allow apposition of the lungs to the chest wall and ensure coupling between the lung, chest wall and diaphragm to optimise ventilation.\n\n",

            "text": "Aetiology (Table 4.1)\n\nSpontaneous Pneumothorax: no underlying trauma or iatrogenic cause for pneumothorax\nPrimary Spontaneous Pneumothorax: no known underlying lung disease (Fig. 4.1)\nIncidence 7.4/100,000 (men) and 1.2/100,000 (women) annually in the USA [3].Caused by rupture of small bleb (bullae) usually in apices of upper or lower lobes, allowing air to leak into the pleural cavity.80 % of patients will demonstrate emphysema-like changes on CT scan [4].Occur most commonly in thin tall young male patients. Smoking and atmospheric pressures changes are also risk factors [5].\n\nSecondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax: known underlying lung disease.Incidence 6.3/100,000 (men) and 2.0/100,000 (women) annually in the USA [3].Underlying disease causing rupture and air leak\n\nClinical PresentationPleuritic chest pain and dyspnea (most common)Physical examination may be normal if the pneumothorax is <25 %.Decreased breath sounds, hyperresonance on the affected side (not always present)Subcutaneous emphysemaTension pneumothorax also presents with tracheal deviation to the contralateral side, severe respiratory distress and haemodynamic instability.Rarely: pneumomediastinum or pneumopericardium (Hamman\u2019s sign)\nDiagnosis is established by an upright chest X-ray (Fig. 4.2). If clinical signs of tension physiology are evident, X-ray confirmation should be omitted and immediate decompression should ensue.\nExpiratory view accentuates the separation of the parietal and visceral pleura.Pneumothorax in supine patients accumulates into the dependent regions of the anterior and subdiaphragmatic pleura and may be detected as a deep sulcus sign.Although CT scan is the gold-standard for diagnosis, it is not necessary for the majority of patients with first-episode spontaneous pneumothorax since it does not change the management.Ultrasound is also an accurate, rapid and non-invasive test, yet requires operator experience.Sensitivity: 95\u201398 %; true-negative rate: 100 % [6, 7]Subcutaneous emphysema can create significant interference.\n\n\nManagementThe aetiology largely dictates both immediate and definitive management.\nObservation:\nReserved for asymptomatic patients with a small pneumothorax who are unlikely to have an ongoing air leak. Follow-up radiography should be obtained within 24\u201348 h to document improvement.Supplemental oxygen can help decrease the alveolar pressure of nitrogen in the body, thus creating a gradient to reabsorb the air from the pleura (mostly composed of nitrogen) into the alveoli and tissues.Conservative management re-expands the lung at an average rate of 2.2 %/day with a 79 % success rate [8].Failure for the pneumothorax to resolve may lead to fibrothorax (fibrous entrapment of the lung).\n\nAspiration:\nA small cannula can be used to aspirate pleural air, with a success rate of 75 and 40 % for a primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, respectively. This technique is rarely used.Can be attached to a Heimlich one-way valve or a three-way stop-cock with a large syringe [9].\n\nPercutaneous Catheters:\nSmall-calibre tube thoracostomy can be performed percutaneously via the Seldinger technique and attached to either a Heimlich one-way valve or suction.Use is limited to a spontaneous pneumothorax with limited respiratory symptoms.\n\nTube Thoracostomy:\nLarge-bore chest tubes are the standard-of-care for treatment of traumatic pneumothoraces, unstable patients, persistent or large air leaks and associated effusions or haemothoraces.Clamping of the tube is controversial. If performed, a follow-up chest radiograph should be done in several hours to assess for re-accumulation.Outpatient management is acceptable with the use of a Heimlich one-way valve [10].Complications of chest tube insertion include: injury to the lung, intercostal vessels, or great vessels, misplacement in the fissures or outside the pleural cavity, infection, and re-expansion pulmonary edema caused with rapid re-expansion leading to increase in capillary permeability.\nThe appropriate initial management option should be tailored to the expected size of the air leak.Conservative options include observation, needle aspiration, and small-bore tube thoracostomy connected to an underwater seal. For persistent or larger air leaks, large-bore chest tubes with underwater seal connected to wall suction can be used, with surgery and/or pleurodesis as last resorts [11].Recurrence after spontaneous pneuothorax is 30 % after the first episode, with the majority occurring within 2 years [12]. Independent risk factors for recurrence include: pulmonary fibrosis, age >60 years, increased height/weight ratio [13]. Recurrence rate increases after each episode.\nSurgery:\nGuidelines recommend waiting at least 3\u20135 days for resolution of a spontaneous pneumothorax before considering definitive surgical management [14].A bullectomy can be performed preferably via a VATS approach with a success rate >95 % [15]. Other options including open thoracotomy and axillary approaches.Indications for bullectomy [14]:After the second spontaneous primary pneumothoraxAfter the first spontaneous primary pneumothorax in patients with high-risk professions, or patients exposed to significant changes in atmospheric pressuresAfter the first spontaneous secondary pneumothorax\n\n\nPleurodesis:\nAlthough surgery as definitive management of recurrent pneumothoraces is preferred, pleurodesis with talc, bleomycin or doxycycline remains an option with success rates of 75\u201390 % [16, 17]. See Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-17497-6_4\n: Pleural Disorders (Pleurodesis Technique).\n\n\n",

If 1 or more are positive, effusion is exudative [25].Pleural Fluid/Serum Protein ratio >0.5Pleural Fluid/Serum LHD ratio >0.6Pleural Fluid LDH >2/3 the upper limit of normal serum LDH\n\n\nPleural Biopsy: can assist the diagnosis of tuberculosis, malignancy, and amyloidosis when diagnosis is uncertain [26].\nPleural Infections (Empyema)Infection of the pleural space (exudative effusion) [27].70\u201380 % patients may be managed with non-surgical management (drainage + antibiotics + fibrinolytic therapy) [28, 29].Increased incidence in alcoholic and intravenous drug users (risk of aspiration) [30].\nSymptomsSimilar to pneumonia: pleuritic chest pain, fever, cough, dyspnea, malaise [20]Constitutional symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia) in malignant pleural effusions\nCausesDirect contamination of pleural space (trauma, surgery)Hematologic spread (bacteremia/sepsis)Direct extension from lung parenchyma (parapneumonic)Rupture of intrapulmonary abscess or infected cavityBronchopleural fistulaExtension from mediastinum (esophageal perforation)\nClassificationProgression through stages occurs over 3\u20136 weeks (Fig. 4.4) [27, 31].\nUntreated empyema eventually progresses to fibro-thorax [32].\nMicrobiology [33]:Community Acquired (85 %):Aerobes (73 %): Streptococci (72 %; S. milleri/anginosus (46 %), S. pneumonia (40 %)), Staphylococci (14 %; MSSA (77 %), MRSA (20 %)), gram-negative (12 %), others (2 %)Anaerobes (22 %)Other (5 %)\nNosocomial (15 %):Aerobes (88 %): Staphylococci (40 %; MRSA (71 %), MSSA (29 %)), gram-negative (26 %), Streptococci (21 %), Enterococci (13 %)Anaerobes (8 %)Other (4 %)\n\nManagementDrainage:Historically large bore chest tubes (30\u201336 Fr) were advocated for drainage of pleural infections due to fear of tube blockage by thick viscous drainage [20].A recent case series using 10\u201316 Fr tubes of pleural infections reported a 72 % success rate, comparable to large bore (>30 Fr) chest tubes [34].A retrospective analysis of 405 patients treated with chest tube drainage of various sizes (<10 Fr, 10\u201314 Fr, 15\u201320 Fr, >20 Fr) revealed no difference in mortality or requirement for decortication [35].No differences in chest radiograph change following drainage, length of stay or pulmonary function after 3 months were noted between tube size groups.Irrigation of pleural cavity can be done with sterile saline following drain insertion, however evidence supporting this practice is lacking [20].\n\nAntibiotics:Patients often present with signs of sepsis.Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy covering gram-positive, gram-negative (including Pseudomonas) and anaerobic bacteria is indicated.Focus antibiotics once cultures obtained.Antibiotics in pleural fluid typically reach approximately 75 % of serum levels [20].Duration of antibiotics: minimal evidence suggesting optimal duration, however therapy is generally continued for 2\u20134 weeks following resolution of signs and symptoms in order to achieve clinical resolution, depending on microbiology, response to therapy, extent of disease, adequacy of drainage and patient factors (e.g. immune status).\nFibrinolytic Therapy (Streptokinase/tPA +/\u2212 DNAse):Used as treatment of loculated parapneumonic effusions and empyema.Aimed to reduce incidence of surgical intervention.Meta-analysis of 7 RCTs comparing fibrinolytic therapy to placebo shows reduction in surgical intervention but not in mortality or length of stay [28].Double-blind RCT MIST2 trial evaluating t-PA and DNAse for patients with pleural infection [36].Randomised to 1 of 4 treatments for 3 days: t-PA and DNAse, t-PA and placebo, placebo and DNAse, double placebo.Primary outcome: change in pleural opacity (percentage of hemithorax occupied by effusion on chest X-ray [Mean (+/\u2212 SD) change in pleural opacity]).t-PA + DNAse versus placebo:Change in pleural opacity: \u221229.5   \u00b1 23.3 % vs. \u221217.2 \u00b1 19.6 %, p=0.005Surgical referral at 3 months: OR 0.17;

CBC and differential demonstrates >80 % lymphocytes [44].\nThoracic Duct AnatomyIntestinal/Lumbar lymphatics \u2192 cysterna chylii (anterior to L1/L2) \u2192 aortic hiatus of diaphragm (T12) \u2192 right chest (between aorta and azygous vein) \u2192 crosses midline at T4 (behind oesophagus) \u2192 left posterior mediastinum (behind aorta, left side of oesophagus, behind left subclavian artery) \u2192 crosses over left subclavian artery (anterolateral mediastinum) \u2192 enters confluence of left jugular and subclavian veins [40].\nTreatment\u2014Traumatic Chylothorax (Post-surgical, Trauma)Pleural Effusion Drainage [27]:Chest tube is used to drain the pleural cavity providing symptomatic relief.Monitoring of drain output (milky colour indicating ongoing chyle leak)\nDietary Control [27, 40]:Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), fasting, or reduced fat diet with Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) supplementation.MCT are absorbed by intestinal epithelium into the portal venous circulation bypassing lymphatic absorption and decreasing lymphatic flow to allow duct closure.\nDietary control measures are usually maintained for 1\u20132 weeks followed by fat challenge (cream or olive oil PO/PT).Increased milky chest tube drainage indicates failure of conservative management [27].\nConservative management with dietary control is successful in approximately 50 % of traumatic chylothorax patients [45]. Patients with high output (>1 L/day) are unlikely to respond to conservative management and will require early operative intervention [46].\nOctreotide:Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue with a longer half-life, theorised to decreased lymph flow rate, lymph volume, as well as digestive enzyme release and intestinal absorption of fatty acids.Prescribed as 50 \u03bcg SC/IV q8hInitial case series and case reports show some success using octreotide or somatostatin to decrease chyle leak rates however RCTs are lacking [47].\nSurgical Management (TD Ligation):Indications:Failed conservative managementHigh output leaks (>1 L/day) [45]\nOperative options include: mass ligation of tissue at diaphragmatic hiatus, duct ligation at diaphragmatic hiatus, direct closure of duct injury [27]Can be approached via right thoracotomy or right-side VATSOlive oil or cream is given PO prior to surgery to improve recognition of duct injury site [27]90 % success rate [45, 48].Some surgeons recommend early operative treatment (within 1 week, if patient can tolerate additional surgery) to minimise nutrient loss and immunosuppression from ongoing leak [49\u201351].\nTD Embolisation (available only in selected centres):TD cannulation rate: 67 %; 90 % resolution of chyle leak post-embolisation [52].\nPrevention:Preoperative oral administration of milk has been shown to facilitate thoracic duct visualisation (95 % vs. 13 %) and decrease risk of duct injury (7 % vs. 13 %) [53].\n\nTreatment\u2014Non-traumatic ChylothoraxTreatment of non-traumatic chylothorax focuses on the treatment of the underlying disease responsible. Concurrent conservative therapy should be instigated (drainage, diet/TPN, +/\u2212 octreotide) [54].Failure of resolution following treatment of disease requires further intervention [54].For malignant chylothorax effusions sclerosant pleurodesis via chest tube or VATS is recommended.Malignant chylothorax patients have limited benefit from TD ligation [55\u201357].\nFor benign or idiopathic chylothorax effusions, thoracoscopic Talc pleurodesis and TD ligation is recommended [45, 58].\nMalignant pleural effusion (MPE)Exudative pleural effusion resulting from metastases to pleuraApproximately 22 % of pleural effusions in the United States; >150,000 cases annually [59]Most common causes include metastatic lung, breast, colon and ovarian cancer [19, 60]Mean life expectancy of 4\u20136 months from effusion onset [61, 62]Treatment is aimed at palliation of symptoms. Small asymptomatic effusions can be followed [19, 60].\nTherapeutic ThoracocentesisSymptomatic patients can receive serial thoracocentesis, due to the high likelihood of recurrence within weeks following each drainage [19].Appropriate for patients with low life expectancy (less than time for recurrence), too frail to receive pleurodesis, or slow pleural effusion recurrence (time to recurrence >1 month) [60].Risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema from rapid drainage of large effusions, pneumothorax, and empyema with repeated drainages. Repeated thoracocenteses also produce adhesions which can diminish success of subsequent procedures [62].\nPermanent Indwelling Pleural Catheters (IPC)Indwelling pleural catheter, which patients can drain manually and achieve long-term control.Day procedure inserted under local anaesthesia.Spontaneous pleurodesis following placement in 40\u201350 % of patients. When drainage <50 cc/day for 3 days, catheter can be removed [60, 63].Indications for catheter placement [60]:Rapid effusion accumulation (<1 month)Life expectancy <3 monthsTrapped lungPoor operative candidateFailure of chemical pleurodesis\nContraindications [60]:Slow effusion accumulation (>1 month)Intrapleural adhesions preventing insertion\nDisadvantages: home nursing care of catheter requiredComplications: re-expansion pulmonary edema (patients instructed not to drain >1000 mL/h), catheter malfunction (9.1 %), pneumothorax requiring chest tube (5.9 %), pain (5.6 %), blocked catheter (3.7 %), empyema (2.8 %), cellulitis (3.4 %), IPC fracture during removal [64]\nPleurodesisInvolves initial drainage of effusion, pulmonary re-expansion, and injection of sclerosant into pleural cavity via thoracostomy tube.Sclerosants include Talc powder, bleomycin and tetracycline derivatives with success rates of 81\u2013100 %, 61 and 65\u201376 % respectively using tube thoracostomy instillation [64].Local anaesthetics such as lidocaine are often co-injected with sclerosants [65].A cost-effective analysis demonstrated chest tube chemical pleurodesis as more cost-effective than IPC placement when patient survival >6 weeks [66].Contraindicated in patients who are extremely frail, have an extremely short life expectancy or have trapped lung preventing lung re-expansion (requirement for success of pleurodesis) [19].Appropriately selected patients with trapped lung and MPE (a contraindication to simple bed-side pleurodesis) can receive symptomatic benefit from VATS pleurectomy, decortication and pleurodesis [32].Cochrane Review Pleurodesis for Malignant Effusions (2004) [67]:Relative Risk (RR) of effusion non-recurrence with sclerosant versus tube thoracostomy drainage alone 1.20 (95 % CI 1.04\u20131.38) favours using sclerosant [5 studies, 228 subjects].RR of effusion non-recurrence using Talc versus all other sclerosants (tetracycline, bleomycin, mustine and tube thoracostomy drainage alone) 1.34 (95 % CI 1.16\u20131.55) favours Talc [10 studies, 308 subjects].RR of effusion non-recurrence using thoracoscopic versus bedside tube thoracostomy instillation of Talc 1.19 (95 % CI 1.04\u20131.36) favours thoracoscopic instillation [2 studies, 112 subjects].RR of effusion non-recurrence using thoracoscopic versus tube thoracostomy bedside instillation of all sclerosants (Talc, tetracycline, bleomycin, mustine) 1.68 (95 % CI 1.35\u20132.10) favours thoracoscopic instillation [five studies, 145 subjects].\n\nGeneral Tube Thoracostomy Pleurodesis Technique (Malignant Effusion)\nChest Drainage:\nTube thoracostomy placement, effusion drainage and lung re-expansion\n\nAnalgesia:\nPrior to sclerosant injection intrapleural injection of lidocaine 3 mg/kg (maximum 250 mg) via chest tube is recommended [62]. Alternatively lidocaine may be added to a normal saline Talc solution.Narcotic analgesia is recommended (+/\u2212 amnestic agent i.e. midazolam).\n\nSclerosant Options:\n\nTalc: 5 g of Talc are dissolved in 100 cc normal saline and placed in two 60 cc Toomey syringes (3 g of Talc are sufficient for pleurodesis for pneumothorax).\nSize-calibrated Talc, <10 % 5\u201310 \u03bcm diameter, is preferred as small particle Talc has been linked to systemic absorption, systemic inflammation and ARDS [68].\n\nDoxycycline: 500 mg of Doxycycline in 50 cc of normal saline [69]\nBleomycin: 60 mg of Bleomycin in 50 cc of normal saline [70]\n\nInjection of Sclerosant:\nTotal volume of sclerosant is injected via tube thoracostomy with patient in supine position.Tube thoracostomy is clamped for 1 h.Some recommend periodic patient reposition every 15 min (supine, left lateral decubitus, prone, right lateral decubitus) during pleurodesis to allow sclerosant to pool throughout pleural cavity, however this technique is equivalent to patients remaining supine [71].After 1 h, the chest tube is placed under \u221220 cm H2O wall suction.\n\nDrain Removal:\nChest tubes are removed after 24 h or when drainage is <150 cc/day.A randomised trial of 41 patients who received pleurodesis for malignant effusion showed no difference in complications or pleurodesis success between short-term and long-term drainage following pleurodesis [72].\n\n",

Despite the decrease in cytoreduction compared to EPP, one recent non-randomised trial reports extended pleurectomy/decortication to have improved median survival (23 months vs. 13 months), 2-years survival (49 % vs. 18 %) and 5-years survival (30 % vs. 9 %) [74].Whole thorax radiation therapy in conjunction with surgery improves local control.Unfortunately, patients with locoregional control from radiotherapy develop systemic disease with limited benefit from chemotherapy (cisplatin/premetrexed: 12-months median survival) [75].\n",
