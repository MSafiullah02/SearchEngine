            "text": "Helicases are proteins that catalyze the separation of RNA or DNA duplexes into single strands using the energy generated by the NTP hydrolysis [1]. Although helicases form a wide and diverse group of proteins, they all share common sequence patterns, the so-called \u201chelicase motifs\u201d. These motifs consist of short conserved amino acids that play a key role in diverse steps of the helicase activity. Based on these motifs, helicases have been classified into five main groups [2] (see Fig. 1). The majority of helicases belong to superfamily 1 (SF1) or superfamily 2 (SF2). Concerning their biological roles, the DNA helicases are involved in replication, recombination and repair processes [3]. RNA helicases function in RNA transcription, editing, splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA export, translation, RNA turnover and organelle gene expression [4]. In addition, it has been suggested that helicases act as RNA chaperones modulating the RNA structure in diverse metabolic processes [5].",

To study their replication, the Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a member of the alphavirus-like superfamily of plant, animal and human viruses, has been proven to be a useful model system [7]. Two viral proteins are sufficient for BMV replication, the polymerase 2a and the replicase 1a. The latter protein has an N-terminal m7G methyltransferase and a covalent GTP-binding activity necessary for capping of the three viral RNAs. The C-terminal half contains a helicase-like domain that was shown to be essential for BMV RNA synthesis. However, its putative helicase activity has not yet been tested because the protein could not be purified sufficiently.",

The databases used for searching sequence and structural homologies were downloaded respectively from Swissprot [8] and the Protein data bank (PDB) [9]. The protein sequences of these databases were formatted into BLAST format [10] and Psi-Blast [10, 11] was used to search homologous sequences of the target protein. Also, the Pfam-A database [12] of protein profiles was downloaded for searching homologous sequences by means of Hidden Markov Models with the program HMMER [13]. The databases of motifs PROSITE [14] and PRINTS [15] were used on the web for searching local motifs. The alignments between the target protein and the templates were obtained by means of fold recognition using 3D-PSSM [16] and FUGUE [17]. Several partial models of the structure of the target sequence were obtained by distance restraints (extracted from the alignment) with the program MODELLER [18, 19] and energy minimized with GROMOS [20]. Statistical energies per residue were calculated with ProsaII [21] for all models and were used to validate their conformations. Finally, the protein models complexed with DNA were obtained by superimposition with STAMP [22] on the structure of the DNA-helicase complex of PcrA with DNA (PDB code 3pjr). All runs were performed on a Pentium Xeon and protein figures were obtained with RasMol [23] and PREPI in a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation.",

This procedure succeeded in matching a P-loop pattern on the sequence of some crystallized helicases (PDB codes 3pjr, 2pjr, 1pjr, 1qhh, 1qhg and 1uaa, which show the common feature of the UvrD helicase domain) and the viral_helicase 1 domain (the sequence-pattern included in the local alignment was GVAGCGKT).

The results with FUGUE were discarded because the Z-score was less than marginal; the best score was 4.68 and it was given to gluconate kinase, while UvrD-helicase ranked on the 8th position with a Z-score of 2.33 and a wrong alignment at the ATP binding site motif. According to 3D-PSSM results, then, the model for the Ct domain of BMV can be obtained either as a member of the DEAD and DEAH box helicase family (SF2 helicases) or as a member of the UvrD-helicases family (SF1 helicases). For a model of the Ct domain as a member of the DEAD/H box helicase family we should use the known structure of MjDEAD, with PDB code 1hv8, or the structure of the Hepatitis C virus NS3 (HCV-NS3), with PDB code 1a1v. On the other hand, the modeling as a member of the UvrD-helicases family should be done with the structure of PcrA, with PDB codes 1pjr and 3pjr, or the structure of RepA, with PDB code 1uaa. ",

This alignment was obtained manually by forcing the first five helicase motifs on BMV 1a to coincide with those of PcrA (see Fig. 3b), using the alignment of the SF2 model as a basis. The steps followed in this process were: (1) we obtained a structural alignment between the structures of SF2 (MjDEAD) and SF1 (PcrA) with the program STAMP; (2) to obtain the alignment between PcrA and BMV 1a we combined the MjDEAD-PcrA alignment with the one previously used in the SF2 model (MjDEAD-BMV 1a) using the common aligned residues; and (3) we manually rearranged the sequence to align the SF1 helicase motifs described for PcrA with those expected in BMV 1a, [3] while maintaining the alignment from step 2 in the zones that did not include these motifs. We used this alignment and the program MODELLER [26] to model build the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a as a member of the SF1.",

The results were acceptable for the three models. Only the \u03b2-strandpredicted between residues 199 and 212 of the model is not found by DSSP, probably due to the lack of an additional \u03b2-strand formed by residues not considered in the model. The interval of residues identified by negative pseudo-energy indicates the correct alignment for the five helicase motifs comprised within the interval limits between the first 50 residues and 210. The model produces a single positive region of the pseudo-energy that falls in a region without helicase motifs. The surface energy according to ProsaII is very similar for the three models, being mostly positive.

The docking of DNA and BMV1a was adjusted manually with Turbo-Frodo [32] and the side chains were refined energetically with GROMOS.

Once the model was built and DNA and ATP molecules were added to the structure, we checked the spatial disposition of the side-chains of the residues in the helicase motifs, so we could asses their putative biological function by analyzing the possible interactions between the these motifs and the helicase substrates. In this sense, we studied the implication of motifs I, II, III and IV in the hydrolysis of the NTP molecule. We found that the side-chains of the conserved residues of these motifs are at bond distances from the phosphates of ATP in the SF1 model. Two conserved residues of motif I, Lys 49 and Gly 48, are 3.9 and 3.0 \u00c5, respectively, from the oxygens of the \u03b2- and \u03b3-phosphate of ATP. In motif II, the carboxylic oxygens of Asp 113 and Glu 114 are 5.4 and 4.9 \u00c5, respectively, from the \u03b2- and \u03b3-phosphate of ATP. And the carbonyl oxygen of the side-chain of Gln 143 in motif III, which is a conserved residue in SF1 helicases, is at 4.7 \u00c5 from the \u03b3-phosphateof ATP.",

On the other hand, some of the interactions found in the crystallographic structure of PcrA in complex with DNA were lost or weakened by the distance when the structure of the SF1 model was binding DNA. For example, the aromatic ring of Phe 146 of the model should have a \u03c0-interaction with one of the nitrogenated bases of DNA at 3.4 \u00c5 and the guanidinium nitrogen of Arg 149 a hydrogen bond with a ribose-phosphate.

Nevertheless, because of the lack of clear experimental evidence of its helicase activity and likely membership to one of the superfamilies of helicases, we needed further proof confirming the function of the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a as a helicase.

Two independent fold-recognition servers based on threading (3D-PSSM and FUGUE) identified a set of helicases of SF1 and SF2, as well as other types of non-helicase proteins that contained a P-loop. Also, the confidence degree of the 3D-PSSM server and the scores obtained by FUGUE for the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a, stated that this was a helicase. Nevertheless, the recognition as a member of the SF1 or SF2 remained unclear, and the alignment with a template sequence of known structure was either insufficient or uncertain. Consequently, we computed two putative models: (1) by means of threading with an automatic alignment from a fold recognition server; and (2) a model obtained by a manual alignment forcing the location of the sequence-motifs described for the SF1 helicases.",

The final assessment of the structure of the modeled fragment was obtained by statistical pseudo-potentials. The pseudo-energies calculated with ProsaII were used to obtain some clues for the identification of BMV 1a and its functional annotation as helicase. Furthermore, these energies were used for the validation of the models (both SF1 and SF2). The energy between pairs of residues resulted positive for the SF2 model while for the SF1 model it was mostly negative. However, this energy was not as negative as for the crystallographic structures of PcrA (as member of SF1 helicases) and the structure of MjDEAD (as member of SF2 helicases). Also, the putative interactions with ATP and DNA were better arranged for the SF1 model. The model building of a partial region of the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a, containing five helicase motifs of the SF1, and the correct interaction of these residues with a polymer of nucleic and an ATP molecule, reinforced the assumption of BMV 1a being a member of the SF1 of helicases.",

The methods of threading or fold prediction can give clues about the structure of a protein sequence. However, this needs further arrangements based on scientific knowledge and the manual intervention of a curator. These final arrangements can be obtained by using sequence patterns or local profiles containing the functional and structural correlation. In this particular example, most coincidences concluded that the most likely structure of the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a was the SF1 model. While threading methods concluded that this fragment was a member of the \u201cP-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolase\u201d fold and probably a member of SF2 helicases, we needed additional manual intervention to construct the model as a member of SF1 helicases. Therefore, although we can not claim a unique answer to the 3D conformation of the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a, the energetic and sequence trends proved the conclusion that the C-tail of BMV 1a was likely a member of the SF1 helicases with a conformation similar to the structure of PcrA. First, this example would answer the main question about the function and structure of the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a. However, in addition, this example would also confirm the use of functional sequence patterns and scientific intuition to obtain a sensible answer on the deepest knowledge and more detailed description of the biological function and conformation of a protein. Answering the possibility of the helicase mechanism as a member of the SF1 helicases also supports the original hypothesis that BMV 1a should have helicase activity. Further experiments should be performed to corroborate the hypothesis. Nevertheless our results clearly hint at this direction.",
