In the very beginning of the development, a combination of ether and Tween 80 was used. 2 Due to the explosive nature, this S/D mixture was replaced by TNBP and Na-cholate, 3 ,4 a combination still in use. 5 Based on further improvements of the S/D technology, TNBP and Tween 80 is the most commonly used combination today. 6 Meanwhile other effective combinations have been demonstrated, including TNBP/Triton X-100 7, 8 or TNBP with mixtures of different detergents. The successful inactivation of human pathogenic viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or model viruses such as Sindbis virus (SINV), Sendai virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was reported by the New York Blood Center. 4 Today, manufacturers of plasma derivatives must investigate all relevant process steps at a well-defined laboratory scale to demonstrate the viral safety of their products. These virus validation studies must follow international guidelines and recommendations. [9] [10] [11] [12] In addition to validation under production conditions, the guidelines require the demonstration of the robustness of each virus inactivation method by investigating the limits of the production conditions or conditions even beyond these limits. As a consequence, all manufacturers of plasmaderived medicinal products worldwide are investigating similar conditions of S/D treatment, using nearly identical spectra of test viruses and generating nearly identical sets of data. 13 Thus, significant amounts of information on virus inactivation by S/D treatment are available meanwhile, but for the most part remain unpublished and are concealed in the archives of companies or regulatory authorities.",

In Fig. 5 for robustness studies, virus inactivation by different combinations of S/D is plotted versus the incubation time and late time points might indicate slower kinetics of virus inactivation. However, the data comprising only the first time point of virus inactivation to below limit of detection allow no conclusions on the kinetics of inactivation or efficiency of the different combinations of solvent and detergent(s). In Fig. 5 , when the virus inactivation capacity is plotted versus the TNBP concentration, some low LRF values (\u05453 log) were observed for low concentrations of TNBP in combination with Tween 80. Again, the reason for those findings might be that most studies at low concentrations of TNBP were done for the combination of TNPB/Tween 80. Thus, a potential influence might be feigned by the smaller number of data for other combinations of S/D. A potential influence of the different combinations on mean values of virus inactivation cannot be identified. Also, when data are plotted versus incubation time, the mean values of inactivation scatter around a magnitude of 4 log inactivation or higher.

            "text": "At production scale, S/D treatment is performed for at least 60 minutes, but for most products considerably longer (usually 6 hr or more). In virus validation studies, incubation periods are usually shorter than at production scale because inactivation of viruses to below limit of detection is achieved already after a few minutes of exposure to S/D ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Short incubation times represent worst-case conditions. In Figs. 1, 2, 4 , 5B, and 6B the virus inactivation capacities are plotted versus the incubation time. The data illustrate that effective virus inactivation is achieved rapidly within the first minutes of S/D treatment. Therefore, rapid inactivation of enveloped viruses results in a high margin of safety at production scale due to the remaining time, still available after virus inactivation to below limit of detection.",

As expected, drastically reduced TNBP concentrations lower than 10% of the standard concentration failed to inactivate some test viruses, for example, PRV and/or BVDV, to below limit of detection, or LRF values were lower than 4 log in 9 of 29 studies (Fig. 8B) .

A potential influence of detergent alone or of decreasing concentrations of detergent at a standard concentration of TNBP was not addressed in the studies presented here. TNBP is almost insoluble in aqueous solutions; thus a sufficient amount of detergent is essential for efficient virus inactivation. Elevated concentrations of Tween 80 in a FVIII solution up to 1.8% (18 g/L) instead of 1% (10 g/L) had no influence on PRV inactivation after 60 minutes of treatment.",
