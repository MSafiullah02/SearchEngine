            "text": "Inflammation is an obligatory marker of arterial disease, both stemming from the inflammatory activity of cholesterol itself and from well-established molecular mechanisms. Raised progenitor cell recruitment after major events and clonal hematopoiesis related mechanisms have provided an improved understanding of factors regulating inflammatory phenomena. Trials with inflammation antagonists have led to an extensive evaluation of biomarkers such as the high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), not exerting a causative role, but frequently indicative of the individual cardiovascular (CV) risk. Aim of this review is to provide indication on the anti-inflammatory profile of agents of general use in CV prevention, i.e. affecting lipids, blood pressure, diabetes as well nutraceuticals such as n-3 fatty acids. A crucial issue in the evaluation of the benefit of the antiinflammatory activity is the frequent discordance between a beneficial activity on a major risk factor and associated changes of hsCRP, as in the case of statins vs PCSK9 antagonists. In hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert an optimal anti-inflammatory activity, vs the case of sartans. The remarkable preventive activity of SLGT-2 inhibitors in heart failure is not associated with a clear anti-inflammatory mechanism. Finally, icosapent ethyl has been shown to reduce the CV risk in hypertriglyceridemia, with a 27% reduction of hsCRP. The inflammation-based approach to arterial disease has considerably gained from an improved understanding of the clinical diagnostic strategy and from a better knowledge on the mode of action of numerous agents, including nutraceuticals. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Recently Lee et al (23) investigated the contribution of SMC to the foam cell abundance in apo E -/mice. By evaluating expression of leukocyte specific markers, non-leukocyte foam cells increased from 37% in 27-week-old to 75% in 57 week-old male apo E -/mice fed a chow diet compared to about 70% in male and female apo E -/after 6 weeks on a Western diet. This finding provides an important link between the observation of foam cells in human and mouse atheromas, suggesting an upregulated role of SMCs in foam cell formation (24). It indicates the need for more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

NLRP3 nucleates the assembly of an inflammasome, leading to caspase 1-mediated activation of the interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) family of cytokines, thus inducing an inflammatory pyroptotic cell death (3) . This molecular mechanism is the final development of the seminal idea by Ross and Glomset, who postulated endothelial injury as the inducer of cell proliferation and expansion of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (4, 5) . The association between local inflammation, elevated levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and noxious life habits brought forward the concept of structural lipoprotein changes allowing aggregation and/or oxidation (6) .",

While bone marrow (BM) and spleen were not considered to play a significant role in atheroma formation, it is now well established that BM is responsible for the enhanced myelopoiesis, allowing recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly monocytes, to the arterial intima (8, 9) . The rise of hematopoietic and progenitor cells (HSPCs) occurring after myocardial infarction (MI) (10) can well explain the increased growth of plaques and the associated higher protease activity. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in addition to eliciting effects through inflammatory mediators, reduces the epigenetic modifier enzyme ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) raising atherosclerotic risk (11) . TET2 deficient cells, when clonally expanded, markedly increase plaque size and NLRP3 inflammasome mediated IL-1\uf062 secretion (12) . Further, toll like receptors, in particular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (13) by interacting with myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) can lead to cellular signaling, resulting in hematopoietic and stromal cell development (14) . Hypercholesterolemia causes HSPCs to proliferate, leading to leukocytosis and enhanced atherosclerosis both in animal models and humans (15). Hematopoietic cells are also characterized by the Akt (protein kinase B) pathway, i.e. a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase playing multiple roles in processes, such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell migration and proliferation, with three isoforms, Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3.",

NLRC5 has an essential role in determining vascular intimal hyperplasia (22) and NLRC5 knock-out (Nlrc5 -/ ) mice exhibit more severe intimal hyperplasia compared to wild-type mice after carotid ligation. Finally, a potential regulator of the proinflammatory signaling from neutrophils is the dimeric S100 A8/A9, a proinflammatory alarmin, highly expressed in neutrophils and rapidly released into the circulation after myocardial ischemia (28). This potent activator of the receptor of advanced glycation end products (29) was found to be associated with reduced ventricular ejection fraction one-year after the MI (30), with a raised incidence of hospitalizations for heart failure.",

In addition to a very effective LDL-C reduction (-45.5%), the evaluation of data after 246 weeks of treatment reported a moderate rise in liver fat (from 0.7 to 10.2%) and, most interestingly, a progressive reduction of hsCRP, with a dramatic change, i.e. -60% from baseline to week 24.

These are epigenetic readers that bind acetylated lysines on histone tails transcription factors via bromodomains (BD 1 and 2) (122) .

In these animals, enalapril treatment reduces atherosclerosis, but in particular, vascular inflammation, by markedly reducing elevated chemokine levels (143) . A direct clinical comparison of a major ACE-inhibitor, ramipril, with the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan, in type 2 diabetics, showed that both exerted a similar antiinflammatory activity, as evaluated from a fall of hsCRP (144) . The mechanisms of the proinflammatory activity of ACE activation and its inhibition by ACE inhibitors have been extensively investigated. ACE stimulation enhances the expression of inducible NO synthase and COX-2 by NF-\u03baB activation (145) , also raising the production of reactive oxygen species and of proinflammatory T cells. ACE-Inhibition suppresses Th17-and Th1-mediated autoimmunity, also promoting production of Treg, favorably modulating inflammation (146) . Ang II may also activate the TLR4 signaling pathway, leading to inflammatory synergism. These proinflammatory cytokines enhance the abnormal serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thus causing insulin resistance (147) . Treatment with ACE-inhibitors will rescue insulin-resistance and, in some cases even cause hypoglycemia (148).",

This agent can reduce vascular SMC proliferation by a potentially additive mechanism to angiotensin receptor blockade and PPAR\uf067\uf020activation (149) . When given to HIV + patients with excess adiposity at 40mg/day treatment, a significant 5% visceral adipose tissue loss with raised urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 were detected, supporting the conclusion that the anti-inflammatory activity may be linked to stimulated eicosanoid metabolism (150) . It is of interest that candesartan, another angiotensin receptor blocker, may reduce TLR2, TLR4 and NFkB activation in monocytes, thus displaying a significant anti-inflammatory effect (151) . Significant differences can be found between the two classes of CCBs. The dihydropyridine CCBs, nifedipine and amlodipine, antagonize L-type calcium channels and have antioxidant effects (155) . The rate-limiting CCBs such as verapamil, may also improve endothelial function, indicating that the benefits of these agents may be related to an improved nitric oxide bioavailability (156) . In gluteal resistance arteries in hypertensive patients, treatment with the CCB nifedipine for 1 year improved vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine, not observed with atenolol (157) . In the coronary vasculature, nicardipine can reverse endothelial dysfunction in non-stenotic segments from hypertensive patients and in stenotic segments from both normotensives and hypertensives (158) . Nicardipine has been shown to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with essential hypertension (159) and to raise coronary vascular responses to acetylcholine. Amlodipine increases basal NO release, whereas lacidipine enhanced the vasodilator responses to both acetylcholine and bradykinin within the forearm circulation of hypertensive patients (160).",

This will induce a proinflammatory trait in macrophages in the adipose tissue and other tissues, including the vasculature (163) . Glucotoxicity Among the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes related inflammation is the reduction of fatty acid synthase (FAS). FAS, a large molecule producing mainly palmitate, as well as other mainly saturated FFAs, is reduced in many tissues in diabetic models. Liver specific inactivation of FAS leads to fatty liver, hypoglycemia and enhanced insulin sensitivity a picture not different from models of the deficiency of the nuclear receptor PPAR\uf061 (166) . FAS deficiency, in contrast, leads to protection from insulin resistance and with disrupted function of Cdc42, a member the RhoGTPase family, coordinating macrophage activation in target tissues (167) . Reduced activation is associated with altered phospholipid and protein composition, responsible for the inflammatory signaling (170) and other mechanism of activation of inflammasomes in macrophages. FAS inhibition thus may lead to reduced atherosclerosis, less adiposity and reduced blood glucose in skeletal muscle. This basic knowledge allows the evaluation of potential links between inflammation and antidiabetic drugs, active not only on glucose, but also on different steps in the diabetes related inflammatory process.",

Similarly, in mice with type 2 diabetes, the SGLT2 inhibitor empaglifozin, in addition to positive changes in hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia reduced markers of inflammation (IL-6, TNF-\uf061\uf02c MCP-1 and CRP levels) (200) .

These findings have postulated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f a role of the NOTCH family in the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (17). Further, the reported novel roles of apolipoprotein binding protein 2 and of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) (17) have clearly indicated the presence of SREBP2 binding DNA sequences in Notch as well as in genes regulating cholesterol synthesis, most likely relevant in adult hematopoiesis (16).",

NLRC5 appears to bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\uf067\uf020inhibiting dedifferentiation of human SMC. These damaging mechanisms are antagonized by the PPAR\uf067\uf020\uf020agonist pioglitazone\uf020(22)\uf02e\uf020\uf020 advanced lineage tracing models on mice and proteomic evaluations in man, in order to accurately define the origin and functions of cell types in lesions and to design improved therapeutic approaches to enhance plaque stability. A novel and poorly explored immune-related area of vascular inflammation is that of serum factor H, a regulator of the alternative complement pathway (25). The central function of factor H related protein 1 (FHR1) has remained unclear. FHR1 competes with factor H in the regulation of its inhibitory activity (26). Studies on the role of factor H and FHR1 in cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis and atherosclerosis have provided exciting openings on the role of FHR1 in the activation of monocyte inflammasomes. FHR1 appears to bind necrotic cells in plaques, in addition inducing inflammasome NLRP3 in blood derived monocytes that subsequently secrete interleukin (IL)1\uf062, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\uf061, IL-18 and IL-6 (27). FHR1 concentrations in patients with antibodyassociated vasculitis are associated with levels of inflammation and progressive disease. This unexpected role for FHR1 during inflammation may explain the protection by FHR1 deficiency, indicating it as potential target for treatment of arterial inflammatory diseases (27).",

Incretin hormone secretion can be activated by inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-1\uf062 (185). The rapid degradation of GLP-1 and GIP by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) has led to the development of two new classes of incretin-based drugs, i.e. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f GLP-1R agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors (186). GLP-1R agonists include liraglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide and albiglutide; DPP-IV inhibitors target degradation systems of incretin hormones and include sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin and alogliptin (187).

Opposite effects can have microbial changes such as those occurring with a major probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum, reducing myocardial infarction in hypertensive animals as well as suppressing LPS-mediated atherosclerotic plaque inflammation. A clinical study indicated an effective preventive activity of the oral administration of a Lactobacillus plantarum strain. This led to the investigation to the most frequent inflammation mediated endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening, i.e. aging. Suppression of microbiota in old mice can reverse endothelial dysfunction and the accompanying vascular oxidative stress and inflammation. Enterobacteriaceae may play a crucial role in atherogenesis induction and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f prevention in old age and identification of the responsible strains has become a major topic of research, the most attractive mechanism being that of improving barrier function in the intestine, thus ameliorating metabolic parameters and inflammation. Dietary components, in particular unsaturated fatty acids and other nutraceuticals from the plant kingdom, have provided exciting results in the reduction of CV diseases and inflammation. While omega-6 fatty acids, aside from their lipid lowering properties, do not seem to exert clear anti-inflammatory activities, omega-3 fatty acids have provided very important findings in the prevention of CV disease, such as in the REDUCE-IT trial with high dose EPA. Aside from the so called pro-resolving lipid mediators, i.e. resolvins, protectins and maresin, the clear anti-inflammatory activity of both EPA and DHA has provided significant benefit, reducing proinflammatory cytokines and hsCRP.",
