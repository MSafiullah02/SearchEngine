In recent years, a rapidly growing body of evidence has underscored the importance of host genetic factors. The effect of genetic and environmental factors on the risk of death was assessed in a study of 960 adoptees.1 Death of a biological parent (but not of an adoptive parent) from infection before the age of 50 years resulted in a six times increase in the relative risk of dying from infection in the adoptee, strongly suggesting that susceptibility to infection aggregates in families. Individuals who are heterozygous for haemoglobin S are known to be protected against malaria, whereas homozygous individuals have sickle-cell anaemia.2 The high frequency of sickle-cell anaemia and other red blood cell disorders in regions where malaria is highly prevalent suggests that infectious agents (eg, Plasmodium falciparum) can exert quite substantial selective pressure on human populations.3 Although natural immunity ensures survival of the species as a whole, individuals themselves are not likely to be immunocompetent to all pathogens, and individual differences in susceptibility to specific pathogens are quite common.4 The development of the Human Genome Project in 1990 propelled the scientific community into a new era, allowing genetic mapping and the development of large-scale gene identification that has greatly facilitated the study of gene polymorphisms.",

In fact, all genetic differences between individuals are estimated to be caused by variability in 3 million bp, which represent about 0\u00b701% of the human genome.5 Since the mutation rate in mammalian genomes is low (10\u22129 per bp per year), most inter-individual variations are inherited. The most frequent variation is the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which occurs on average every 1300 bp. Another type of genetic mutation is the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR); VNTRs consist of repeats of sequences ranging from a single basepair to thousands of basepairs.6 The term microsatellite is used for repeats of one to six nucleotides, whereas repeats of longer units are called minisatellites (seven to 100 nucleotides) or, in the extreme case, satellite DNA (more than 100 nucleotides). Since the number of repeats varies among individuals, VNTRs have been widely used as genetic markers.",

A haplotype refers to the arrangement of two or more alleles on the same chromosome. Currently, there is much debate about which approach is the most appropriate. Studies have proposed that the underlying structure of the human genome can be described by use of a relatively simple framework in which the data are parsed into a series of discrete haplotype blocks.10, 11 This observation has led to the development of haplotype tagging methods that aim to capture the haplotype structure in a candidate region.11 Haplotype tagging refers to the concept that most of the haplotypic structure in a particular chromosomal region can be captured by genotyping a smaller number of markers than all of those that constitute the haplotypes. The crucial markers to type would be the minimum set of markers that unambiguously identify each possible haplotype.",

            "text": "The detection and estimation of familial aggregation is usually the first step in the genetic analysis of a trait. Once familial aggregation has been documented, the traditional approach has been to narrow down the genetic region of interest by use of linkage analysis, followed by fine mapping and association studies (table 1\n). Linkage and association studies are based on the same underlying principle: once a mutation occurs on a particular chromosome, it is subsequently transmitted to offspring together with nearby loci. This association is broken down at each successive generation by recombination (ie, homologous chromosomes pair during the meiotic cell division and exchange genetic material). When two loci are close enough on the same chromosome that their alleles cosegregate when passed on to the next generation, we say that the two loci are linked.12 Linkage disequilibrium refers to allelic association that is caused by linkage, or in other words, that has not yet been broken up by recombination.12 An association between two loci, such as the non-independence of alleles at these loci, may be caused not only by linkage, but also to factors such as population stratification or chance. Population stratification refers to the situation in which study participants are selected from genetically different subpopulations. Population stratification will only lead to a spurious association (and hence be a confounder) if both the allele and disease frequencies differ across subpopulations.13 Some researchers have argued that too much emphasis has been put on this issue and surprisingly few examples can be found that unequivocally show that population stratification has led to a spurious association.14, 15\n",

Therefore, RIG-I and MDA5 are able to detect single-stranded RNA present in the cytoplasmic compartment and thus not accessible to endosomal TLR3. Interestingly, RIG-I and MDA5 can discriminate between different types of viruses. RIG-I is essential for the production of interferons in response to paramyxoviruses, influenza virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, whereas MDA5 is crucial for detection of picornavirus.20\n",

Vertebrate TLRs are an example of evolutionary conservation that indicate the difficulty for the microbes to mutate genes that encode MAMPs.73, 74 The CD209 (DC-SIGN) proteins, a family of C-type lectins that participate in the recognition of various pathogens, display a complex pattern of evolution. Whereas CD209 has been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of aminoacid changes, CD209L (also known as DC-SIGN2 or DC-SIGNR) exhibits greater variation across human populations.75 Such variations may be tolerated because of the potentially redundant functional activities of the molecules encoded by these genes.76 The killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes encode a family of receptors expressed by natural killer cells, which participate in early responses against infected or transformed cells through production of cytokines and direct cytotoxicity.77, 78 By contrast with TLRs and CD209, only a small proportion of KIR alleles are conserved among primates, showing a rapid species-specific diversification of the KIR gene family members and a plasticity of the genomic region that parallels that of the MHC loci.79 Thus, the evolutionary forces driving the genesis of natural killer receptors and their HLA ligands represent a concerted response to pathogens. Finally, a remarkable success of evolutionary genomics in infectious diseases is the identification of protein regions relevant for host\u2013pathogen interactions in HIV-1 infection. Comparative analysis of the primate antiretroviral cellular defence genes encoding for ABC3G and TRIM5\u03b1 have revealed the powerful selective pressures emerging from a long-standing battle between retroviruses and their hosts.80, 81, 82 Singular aminoacids or regions (patches) contain key residues that confer primates the ability to combat HIV-1.",

Of note, R753Q was associated with decreased responsiveness to bacterial lipopeptides.95 The role of a microsatellite polymorphism (GT repeat) in the exon 2 of TLR2 has been studied in 176 Korean patients with tuberculosis and 196 healthy controls.7 A shorter GT repeat was found more frequently in tuberculosis patients than healthy individuals (49\u00b74% vs 37\u00b77%, p=0\u00b702), and was associated with weaker promoter activities and lower TLR2 expression in CD14-positive peripheral blood monocytes. Two non-synonymous SNPs in the extracellular domain of TLR4 found to be in linkage disequilibrium (D299G and T399I) have been associated with an increased susceptibility to infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria,103, 104\nBrucella spp,98 respiratory syncytial virus,88 and P falciparum.99 Individuals heterozygous for the D299G and T399I SNPs were hyporesponsive to lipopolysaccharide as measured by bronchospastic response after inhalation of endotoxin.31 Furthermore, airway epithelial cells isolated from heterozygous individuals had deficient response to lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that D299G and T399I acted in a dominant fashion with respect to the wild-type allele.31 However, monocytes and whole blood isolated from heterozygous individuals did not show abnormal responses to lipopolysaccharide,127, 128 suggesting that the effects of these mutations may vary between cell types. Although two studies had shown that D299G,103 or D299G and T399I,104 were associated with an increased risk of Gram-negative infections or septic shock, three subsequent studies did not find an association in patients with meningococcal sepsis.120, 121, 122 However, in one study, rare heterozygous missense mutations of TLR4 were linked with the development of meningococcal disease.120 Unexpectedly, D299G and T399I were associated with decreased rather than increased susceptibility to Legionella pneumophila infection.32 A stop codon polymorphism in TLR5 (R392stop), shown to abolish the ability of TLR5 to detect bacterial flagellin, has been associated with increased susceptibility to pneumonia caused by L pneumophila.123\n",

Associations are likely to occur when non-causal markers are in linkage disequilibrium with the true disease locus. Although the replication of a finding in an independent sample decreases the risk of a false-positive result, the functional significance of the genetic variant should ultimately be shown in biological studies. However, proving biological plausibility may be difficult in view of the limitations of in-vitro studies used as proxy of complex in-vivo biological processes. For example, use of gene-silencing techniques often reduces the biological observation to that of an on/off system, which does not allow the detection of quantitative variations (ie, a dose-response effect) of gene expression or discrete functional alterations. With the increasing use of high-throughput genotyping techniques, the number of genetic associations that will be reported in the years to come will most probably exceed our capacity to do proper functional studies and hence to provide convincing evidence for biological plausibility.139 Future functional studies should therefore focus on genetic polymorphisms that exert a strong effect, have been replicated by independent investigators, and have potential diagnostic or therapeutic implications. To limit the importance of positive publication bias, it will be crucial for investigators and journal editors to become less reluctant to publish well-conducted negative studies.139\n",

A better understanding of microbial genomics and genetics and host innate immunogenetics is likely to provide important information for the development of new vaccines.

Cytokines induce and regulate the inflammatory response and orchestrate the adaptive immune response. By contrast with other TLRs, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are expressed mainly in the endosomal compartment (2), where local acidification is required for recognition of microbial products by their cognate receptors. Intracellular pathogens or microbial products released intracellularly after lysis of ingested microorganisms may also interact with intracytoplasmic receptors, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like (NLR) proteins (3), or the RNA helicase-containing molecules (4: RIG-I or MDA5).

TLR2 forms a heterodimer with either TLR1 to detect triacyl lipopeptide or TLR6 to detect diacyl lipopeptide and zymosan. TLR2 is also involved in the recognition of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PG), lipoarabinomannan (LAM), porins (Neisseria spp), glycosylphosphatidylinositol mucin (Trypanosoma spp; tGPI), and the haemaglutinnin protein (HA, measles virus). TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are located in the endosomal compartment and detect nucleic acids and/or haemozoin (Plasmodium spp, TLR9). Through their intracellular domain, TLRs interact with specific adaptor proteins, including the myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), the TIR domain-containing adapter inducing interferon (TRIF), and the TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM). These adaptors lead to the activation of several transcription factors such the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB), the activating-protein 1 (AP1), and/or the interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3/7) that ultimately induce the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. ss=single-stranded. ds=double-stranded.",
