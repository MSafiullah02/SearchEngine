The estimated case fatality rate is approximately 3.4% in China. However, some patients experience dyspnea within 1 week and develop rapidly to organ injury and even death within 2 weeks after dyspnea. 1 In addition, early organ injury could lead to higher risks of mortality. Thus, early identification of patients at risk of organ injury and death is crucial, which saves the patients from classified and invasive treatment, improving clinical outcome and prognosis. The human immune system plays significant roles in the resistance of foreign pathogens and the progress of pneumonia. Recent studies have mentioned that T cells were decreased in COVID-19 patients, excessive activated immune response was caused by pathogenic Th1 cells, and inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + monocytes may connect to pulmonary immunopathology, leading to deleterious clinical manifestations and even acute mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infections. 2 SARS-CoV-2 might damage lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, and the immune system was impaired during the period of disease to cause tissue injury. 2, 3 Therefore, immune dysfunction is very likely to be a risk factor for patients with COVID-19, and immunological profiling may assist in the prediction of organ injury and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. However, few studies have systematically reported immunological characteristics and their relationship with organ injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19.",

The patient's leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte counts, CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T-cell counts, C4, Hs-CRP, and procalcitonin had strong predictive values for in-hospital mortality, organ injury, and severe pneumonia. Decreased lymphocyte subsets and increased neutrophil, C4, and Hs-CRP were independently associated with high risks of mortality and organ injury, respectively. Therefore, clarifying the immunophenotype of COVID-19 pneumonia may contribute to the development of specific immunotherapy to correct the immune changes that lead to poor prognosis in patients with the disease.",
