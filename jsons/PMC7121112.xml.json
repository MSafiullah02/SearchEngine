This effect of mismatching has been investigated and is directly related to nucleotides involved (Table 3.1). Studies show that mutations at the 3\u2032-part of the primer, where the polymerase starts the elongation, lead to a suboptimal amplification efficiency and an underestimation of the amount of target. Mismatches A\u0387A (A in the primer and A in the target), A\u0387G, G\u0387A, G\u0387G and C\u0387C lead to an underestimation of the amount of the target by a factor of 100. T\u0387C, C\u0387T, or T\u0387T mismatches result in an underestimation by a factor of 10 to 100 of the target and A\u0387C, C\u0387A, T\u0387G and G\u0387T mismatches have nearly no effect. The inhibitory effect on target amplification decreases when the mutation is moved to the 5\u2032-end of the primer and disappears after 5 nucleotides from the 3\u2032-primer end. The effect of mutations in primers and primer binding sites also depends on the G/C content of the primers and the sequence itself (e.g. the G/C content on the 3\u2032-end of the primer) and the annealing temperature.\n",

            "text": "Probe-systems that are mostly used in diagnostics of viral infections with qPCR are hydrolysis probes and hybridisation probes:Hydrolysis probes bind to the target sequence during the annealing phase. These probes are designed with a Tm approx. 10 \u2103 higher than the Tm of the primers. During DNA synthesis, in the elongation phase, the hybridized probe is reached and hydrolysed by the 5\u2032-3\u2032-exonuclease activity of the polymerase. By breaking down the probe, the reporter-fluorochrome (VIC, FAM, TET, etc.) and quencher (TAMRA) are separated and \u2018fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)\u2019 (the signal from the reporter) is released (see Vol. 1, Chap. 3). MGB-or LNA-probes are types of hydrolysis probes that are frequently used in qPCR assays for the diagnosis of viral infections (Vol. 1, Chap. 3). When these probes are designed well, they allow up to three mismatches in the target sequence without much loss of signal. Applications where mismatch-tolerance is needed are for instance qPCR for detection of variable viral targets. However, in virology, there are also applications where it is important that molecular variation is detected, for instance in the detection of viral variants with different pathogenicity or in the detection of mutations that are associated with resistance to antiviral medication. So, depending on the purpose of the assay, more or less mismatches can be tolerated.Hybridisation probes used in viral diagnostics can be used as molecular \u2018beacons\u2019. Molecular \u2018beacons\u2019 are long probes with a loop structure, which contains the part of the probe that binds to the target region. Attached to the probe are two G-C rich, complementary regions that create the hairpin structure. One side of the probe is labelled with the fluorescent dye, the other with the quencher. These probes release a fluorescent signal upon hybridization to the target DNA and are not hydrolysed during the elongation phase in the PCR reaction. Molecular \u2018beacon\u2019 probes can be designed (Tm of the loop compared to the Tm of the stem) to be very sensitive to detect mutations, for example mutations that are associated with viral resistance. Other hybridization probes are double stranded probes containing a long strand (>40 nt) labelled with the reporter fluorochrome and a short strand homologous to the reporter probe (<16 nt), which is labelled with the quencher molecule. During elongation, the reporter probe will preferably bind to the target DNA and the probe with the quencher will be released, thereby releasing the signal. This method allows detection of the signal at much lower temperatures (until 37 \u2103) and is much less sensitive to mutations in the target sequence without affecting the PCR efficiency. However, these probes are more difficult to design compared to hydrolysis probes.\n",

            "text": "It is not only important to detect a virus, but often the analysis of genotypic characteristics of the virus is also important. Within one species, there are often strains with different characteristics and different pathogenicity, in need of other treatment strategies. An example is the group of enteroviruses. The genus enterovirus consists of the species echovirus, rhinovirus, poliovirus, enterovirus and coxsackievirus. Furthermore, these species consist of several subspecies and strains. In viral diagnostics, it is important to distinguish, for instance, the pathogenic poliovirus from other species within the genus of enteroviruses, but it may also be relevant to type viruses within the species. This can be done to obtain information on the relationship between different isolates in case of outbreaks, to identify strains with increased virulence or for epidemiological purposes. Another example is human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is associated with cervical cancer. Within this genus there are high-risk HPV (hrHPV) strains, (e.g. HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 53, 66 and 68), probably hrHPV strains (e.g. HPV 26) and low-risk HPV strains (e.g. 40, 42, 72, 81 etc.). Distinguishing these (probably) hrHPV strains from the low-risk strains is essential for clinical diagnostics.",

These assays consist of a qPCR combined with a hybridization assay (Vol. 1, Chaps. 4 and 5). The hybridization assay is performed on nitrocellulose strips that contain lines loaded with genotype-specific oligonucleotides. To detect drug-resistant variants, the strips contain wild type and mutant-specific oligonucleotide probes. The advantage of this method, compared to sequencing, is that more samples can be processed in the same time and that the evaluation of test results is less time-consuming.

Scraping of the bottom of the vesicle, where most virus-infected cells are present, may result in a very high viral load. Second, the viral load may not fluctuate too much in relation to the time that is needed to generate a quantitative test result. In acute viral infections, the virus load increases quickly to very high levels and decreases after that. For many acute viral respiratory infections it is not possible to show a relation between the viral load and the seriousness of the respiratory disease. Third, variation in virus load that is caused by the procedure has to be avoided. There are many factors that influence the outcome of the viral load: sample handling and freeze thawing, pipetting deviations, sample viscosity, batch-differences in reagent preparation and PCR-kits, etc. To obtain reliable quantitative test results, these factors have to be avoided.",

Thus far, the differences in genotypes have only been shown to have minor consequences for treatment strategies, but they are of interest for predictions. For instance, hepatitis B genotypes A and B seem to respond relatively well to treatment with Interferon-alpha, compared to, for instance, genotype C and D. A physician tends to preferably treat genotypes A or B with Interferon. Treatment with Interferon aims at improving the antiviral response of the immune system, at reducing viral susceptibility of cells by enhancing Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-antigen expression and at inducing cellular proteins that are important in the natural defense of cells against viruses.

One mutation, called the YMDD motive, is associated with resistance to lamivudine. The YMDD motive is a conserved sequence in the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of hepatitis B virus consisting of tyrosine (Y), methionine (M), and two aspartates (DD). Replacement of the methionine by isoleucine (YIDD) or valine (YVDD) leads to resistance. Since the polymerase and hepatitis B surface antigen genes overlap, replacement of nucleotides may also lead to changes in the surface antigen. Therefore, the mutations also have an impact on the production and secretion of the HBsAg. Lamivudine has long been the only treatment option for hepatitis B, but now has been replaced by other more potent antivirals, like entecavir and tenofovir. Entecavir, however, is less effective in patients who have been pretreated with lamivudine and who carry the YMDD variant of hepatitis B.

In the past decades, hepatitis C was treated with a combination of interferon-alpha and ribavirin. Nowadays, an increasing number of direct-acting antivirals (DAA\u2019s) are available. Several viral proteins involved in the HCV lifecycle, such as the non-structural (NS) 3/4A serine protease, the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the NS5A protein, are targets for these drugs. NS5A plays a role in the formation of a replication complex of the virus and in the release of new viral particles. The Hepatitis C virus has 7 major genotypes, all with different prevalence and different responses to treatment. Genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are most prevalent in western countries. Genotyping can be performed with a LiPA assay, but sequence-based assays have also been developed. First-generation protease-inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir are active against hepatitis C genotype 1, but they are less effective and therefore not registered for other genotypes. New NS3-protease-inhibitors are registered for treatment of genotype 1 and 4. Polymerase inhibitors and NS5A inhibitors show less genotypic specificity.
