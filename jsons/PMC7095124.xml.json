The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of VAP uses a combination of clinical, radiographic, and microbiological criteria for diagnosis, but in the absence of a benchmark diagnostic test, the accurate diagnosis and treatment of VAP is limited. There has been a steady decline in reported VAP rates over the last several years in the USA, with the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reporting an incidence of VAP from 0.0 to 5.8 per 1,000 ventilator days [2]. It is unclear if this reduction in VAP incidence is the result of improved prevention measures or due to underestimation in a setting of public reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) [3]. The CDC recently introduced a new concept\u2014ventilator-associated events (VAE), a tiered approach as an objective surveillance measure to improve the accuracy of diagnosing ventilator-related complications [4]. However, the utility of VAE to identify all patients with pneumonia, the ability to prevent VAEs, and the role of VAEs in day to day clinical practice are uncertain.",

Recently, investigators have raised concerns about adherence to the guideline recommendation of using routine combination therapy for VAP [6, 7].

There was no significant difference among the six common etiologic agents between patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and VAP. However, P.\naeruginosa (26.6 %) and Acinetobacter species were more common in VAP than in HAP patients, and the incidence of S. aureus was lower among patients with VAP than among patients with HAP (19.5 vs. 26.6 %). Esperatti and colleagues prospectively compared 315 episodes of ICU-acquired pneumonia over a 3-year period in ventilated (n = 164) and non-ventilated patients (n = 151) [19]. There was no significant difference in the relative proportion of etiologic pathogens isolated in both the groups, except for S. pneumoniae, which was more common in non-ventilated ICU patients than VAP patients. In another prospective surveillance study comparing 327 episodes of VAP in 309 patients with 261 episodes of HAP in 247 patients, the patients with VAP had more episodes of Gram-negative bacilli, compared to patients with HAP (59 vs. 39.6 %, p < 0.001) and HAP patients had a higher incidence of S. pneumoniae and viruses [20].",

The CPIS score can be more valuable if used in conjunction with a good lower respiratory tract sample, which includes Gram staining [32]. In another study, 299 mechanically ventilated patients had twice weekly surveillance endotracheal aspirate cultures (EA) [33], and in the 41 patients diagnosed with VAP by BAL, the CPIS score was significantly elevated compared to 34 patients with negative BAL culture (6.6 vs. 5, p = 0.001). The initial empiric antibiotic therapies based on the EA cultures were adequate in 95 % of patients with VAP.

However, in that study, serial measurements of oxygenation did distinguish patients with an unfavorable outcome from those with a good outcome. Ramirez and colleagues found that a combination of CPIS of at least 6 points and serum PCT levels of at least 2.99 ng/mL had 100 % specificity and negative predictive value of 92 % (AUC = 0.961) for the diagnosis of VAP in a small study (n = 44) [36].

The definitions focus on worsening oxygenation (defined by ventilator settings and not by physiologic measurements) and systemic signs of infection and exclude the use of chest radiography. Problems with this definition include the need for an initial 2 days of stability, thus excluding some early VAP, and dependence on changes in the FiO2 rather than on a more physiological PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Hayashi and colleagues retrospectively analyzed the data from 543 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, comparing 153 patients with VAC to 390 without, and observed that those with VAC had a higher ICU length of stay (22 vs. 11 days), duration of mechanical ventilation (20 vs. 5 days), and use of antibiotics but no difference in overall ICU mortality [40]. VAC definitions were not specific for VAP and included atelectasis in 16.3 %, acute pulmonary edema in 11.8 %, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in 6.5 %. Thus the VAC definition identified sick patients, but not all VAC patients had pneumonia.\n",

Luna and associates prospectively studied an antibiotic strategy based on routine endotracheal aspirate (ETA) culture in 283 ventilated patients, compared to empiric therapy based on the 2005 ATS/IDSA guidelines [54]. Sensitivity for ETA to predict a BAL-obtained pathogen was 62.4 % and was better if done within 3 days of VAP onset. Antibiotic choice based on the ATS/IDSA guidelines led to appropriate therapy in 97.9 %, compared to only 77.4 % based on ETA cultures, but there were fewer antibiotic days using the ETA-based culture. In another study, Brusselaers and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of 14 studies with 791 VAP episodes to analyze the predictive accuracy of twice weekly lower respiratory tract surveillance cultures on subsequent VAP microbiology [55]. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95 % CI = 0.65\u20130.83) and 0.92 (95 % CI = 0.85\u20130.96) respectively for surveillance cultures, and the accuracy improved with twice weekly cultures and if only the latest cultures are used for prediction. But, most importantly, the surveillance cultures had a high negative likelihood value in culture-positive VAP patients especially with MDR pathogens and thus, potentially, routine surveillance cultures can reduce the antibiotic usage. However, the included studies in this meta-analysis are heterogeneous (included studies ranged from 1995 to 2012) and potentially subject to ascertainment bias. Thus, surveillance-based cultures may be helpful in guiding de-escalation and in reducing antibiotic use.",

A subsequent study corroborated this finding and confirmed that using 15 versus 8 days of therapy led to no difference in mortality, ICU length of stay, and mechanical ventilation days [59]. However, the rate of secondary infection was higher in the shorter duration group (35.3 vs. 19.3 %, p = 0.01). In a recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of VAP, a 7-day course of high dose (1 g) of doripenem, given by a 4-h infusion, was compared to a 10-day course of a 1-g dose of imipenem, each given every 8 h [60]. The study was prematurely stopped because of documented inferiority of the 7-day regimen, particularly for VAP patients infected by P. aeruginosa. All-cause 28-day mortality was also higher in the doripenem arm compared to imipenem, although not significantly (21.5 vs. 14.8 %), but mortality was statistically higher for patients with P. aeruginosa who were treated with a 7-day course of doripenem. A recent meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials comparing short (7\u20138 days) with longer (10\u201315 days) duration regimens in VAP showed no difference in mortality, and increased antibiotic-free days in the shorter course group [61].

Linezolid achieves higher lung epithelial lining fluid concentrations than glycopeptides and could therefore have an advantage for MRSA lung infections. However, two older meta-analyses demonstrated comparable clinical and microbiologic success with using linezolid and glycopeptides and a significantly increased risk of thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal events with linezolid [62, 63]. Since those analyses, a multicenter prospective randomized trial of linezolid versus vancomycin for patients with documented MRSA pneumonia was completed, and linezolid led to a significantly higher rate of clinical response than optimally dosed vancomycin [64]. Although there was no difference in mortality between the two groups, this could potentially be explained by the fact that patients who failed vancomycin were able to be salvaged with linezolid, and any survival in this setting was attributed to vancomycin. Kalil and associates repeated their meta-analysis, using nine randomized controlled trials, including patients from the last study, and concluded that there was no significant difference in mortality and microbiological response comparing linezolid and vancomycin [65]. However, there were concerns regarding the quality of trials included in the analysis, with a trend in favor of linezolid in the better designed trials. In a response to this meta-analysis, Wunderink et al. found a significantly better clinical response with linezolid, if only patients with documented MRSA pneumonia were included [66]. Another recent meta-analysis that also included the new randomized controlled trial of linezolid versus vancomycin did find a higher microbiologic eradication rate for linezolid, and more nephrotoxicity when glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) were used [67]. Recent data from the IMPACT-HAP study also demonstrated that patients with MRSA VAP treated with linezolid were more likely to experience clinical resolution of pneumonia than vancomycin-treated patients (p = 0.018) [68].",

Guner and associates reported the efficacy of tigecycline in 33 patients (19 with VAP) with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp., usually when used as part of a combination regimen [70]. In an exploratory study that tried to improve the efficacy of tigecycline against Acinetobacter spp. by increasing the dosing, tigecycline was comparable to imipenem in VAP patients, when used with a 200-mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg every 12 h (which is twice the dose that was used in the negative study above) [71]. Montravers and associates in a prospective study of 156 ICU patients treated with tigecycline (mostly intra-abdominal infections and 24 % lung infections) noted that the success rate was higher with longer duration of treatment (more than 9 days).

Over time, there was more improvement in prevention strategies than in therapy approaches, and overall, a significant increase in guideline concordance [aggregate concordance (mean [SD]), 50.7 % (6.1), 54.4 % (7.1), 56.2 % (5.9), 58.7 % (6.7) p = 0.007, in three consecutive 6-month periods]. They also observed a reduction in VAP rates (events/330 patients): 47 (14.2 %), 34 (10.3 %), 38(11.5 %), 29 (8.8 %) (p = 0.03) over the study period, but ICU mortality and length of ICU remained unchanged. Thus the data from these two studies showed a decrease in VAP rates after introduction of preventive interventions, but also highlight several potential barriers to guideline implementation and variable practices that exist within the community.",

            "text": "Studies of early tracheostomy and its influence in reducing the incidence of VAP have not been conclusive, with some studies showing benefit, while others with no clear advantage. A meta-analysis by Griffiths and colleagues compared early tracheostomy with either late tracheostomy or prolonged endotracheal intubation. Early tracheostomy (within 7 days of invasive mechanical ventilation) did not significantly reduce the risk of VAP or mortality but reduced the number of days on the ventilator and ICU stay [84]. Blot and associates randomized critically ill patients expected to require more than 7 days of mechanical ventilation to either (open or percutaneous) early tracheostomy within 4 days or prolonged intubation [85]. The study was prematurely stopped after enrolling 125 patients as no difference was found between the two groups in mortality, VAP incidence, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, sedation use, or laryngeal or tracheal complications. In another trial, investigators compared the effectiveness of early tracheotomy (after 6\u20138 days of endotracheal intubation) to late tracheotomy (after 13\u201315 days) in reducing the incidence of pneumonia [86]. Even though 209 patients were randomized to the early group and 210 patients to the late group, 31 % of the early group and 43 % of the late group did not receive tracheostomy. Although there was a trend towards decreased VAP incidence with the early tracheotomy group, there was no significant difference between the groups in VAP rates (14 vs. 21 %, p = 0.07) or mortality. As with earlier trials, there were significantly more ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at 28 days in the early tracheotomy group. Another recent multicenter, open, randomized trial by Young and associates did not show any difference in 30-day mortality, length of ICU stay, or tracheostomy-related complications in the early (within 4 days) compared to late tracheostomy group (after 10 days) [87]. Thus on the basis of these studies there is not enough compelling evidence that routine early tracheotomy can prevent the development of pneumonia, but patients who underwent early tracheostomy had significantly more ventilator-free days.",

The morbidity and mortality related to VAP remain high and, in the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosis, suspected VAP patients should be started on antibiotics recommended as per the 2005 ATS guidelines and a knowledge of local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Using a combination of clinical severity scores, biomarkers, and cultures might help with reducing the duration of therapy and achieving antibiotic de-escalation. The new CDC surveillance definition of VAE is not helpful in identifying all patients with VAP. There is still uncertainty regarding VAP diagnosis and management, and controversies are highlighted in this review. Having a centralized national registry for VAP patients might be beneficial in answering several of the controversial questions, but governmental penalties and institutional policies might be challenging as we seek to achieve this goal.",
