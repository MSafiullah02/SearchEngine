Melatonin has been shown to prevent paralysis and death in mice infected with the encephalomyocarditis virus and to decrease viremia. Melatonin also postpones the onset of the disease produced by Semliki Forest virus inoculation and reduces the mortality of West Nile virus-infected mice stressed by either isolation or dexamethasone injection. An increase in the host resistance to the virus via a peripheral immunostimulatory activity is considered responsible for these effects. It has also been demonstrated that melatonin protects some strains of mink against Aleutian disease, and prevents the reduction of B-and T-cells as well as Th1 cytokine secretion in mice infected with leukemia retrovirus. In VEE-infected mice, melatonin postpones the onset of the disease and death for several days and reduces the mortality rate. This protective effect seems to be due to the increase in the production of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), as 100% of the infected mice treated with melatonin die when IL-1b is blocked with antimurine IL-1b antibodies. Although melatonin administration raises serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interferon-gamma (IFN-c), the mortality observed in neutralization experiments with the corresponding anticytokine antibodies, suggests that neither TNF-a nor IFN-c are essential for the protective effect of melatonin on murine VEE virus infection. Melatonin treatment also enhances the efficiency of immunization against the VEE virus. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the dissemination of this virus, and their deleterious effects may be diminished by melatonin. This indole inhibits nitric oxide synthetase activity and it is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide, which also plays an important role in the spread of the VEE virus. In conclusion, the immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects of melatonin suggest that this indole must be considered as an additional therapeutic alternative to fight viral diseases.",

When evaluated 6 days after virus inoculation (10 LD 50 per mouse) the mortality rates of mice treated with 250, 500, and 1000 lg melatonin per kilogram were 45, 40, and 16%, respectively, as compared with 100% in control-infected mice. In addition, melatonin treatment delayed the onset of the disease and prolonged the time to death in the treated mice. In surviving mice receiving the indoleamine, the VEE virus IgM antibody titers were highly elevated 7 wk after virus inoculation [44] . The administration of melatonin significantly decreased the virus levels in blood and brain as compared with the infected control mice. When mice were pretreated with melatonin for 10 days, a significant increase in the survival rate (73%) was observed when compared with the 60% obtained after the standard 3 days of pretreatment. In cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts with serial dilutions of VEE virus, melatonin significantly reduced the degree of cell destruction. This finding contrasts with that reported by Ben-Nathan et al. [41] who found no effect of the indoleamine on SFV growth in tissue culture. However, our results do not preclude the possibility that melatonin alters the host resistance to the virus, rather than viral replication, via a peripheral immunostimulatory effect, as fibroblasts are capable of producing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) whose antiviral activity is known [45] . Melatonin did not stimulate the synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2) but increased the serum concentration of interferon-c (IFN-c). In infected mice, treated or non-treated with melatonin, IFN-c levels in serum were also augmented. A direct and/or an immune-based effect of melatonin on VEE viral replication within the brain was suggested by the fact that on day 5 after inoculation, the virus was not detected in the brain [44] .",

This protection is approximately 50% of that provided to immunocompetent mice suggesting that this indoleamine requires, at least partially, the integrity of the immune system to induce its protective activity. The lack of effect of melatonin on the viral titers in the brain of immunodepressed mice contrasts with the finding that melatonin administration reduces VEE virus levels in the brain of immunocompetent mice [44] suggesting that the antiviral mechanisms stimulated by melatonin in immunocompetent mice are absent or diminished in the immunodepressed animals. The protection provided by melatonin against oxidative damage to cell components [6] could be responsible, at least in part, for the increase in the survival rate of the immunodepressed infected mice. In this regard, it was demonstrated that mice with targeted deletions in either their interferon-alpha-beta-receptor (IFNAR-1-/-) or interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2-/-) genes were more susceptible than control mice to VEE infection. The IFNAR-1-/-mice exhibited accelerated VEE virus dissemination to serum and brain when compared with control mice. In IRF-2-/-mice inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) gene, induction was completely absent following VEE virus infection. When the role of cells involved in iNOS production was evaluated, it was found that primary microglial cell cultures were highly sensitive to VEE virus infection. Besides, this infection increased the levels of nitric oxide in resting microglial cultures, but decreased nitric oxide production in IFN-c-stimulated microglia. These findings suggest that reactive nitrogen species play an important role in the spread of the VEE virus [47] . It is interesting to note that melatonin inhibits cerebellar NOS activity [48] and is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide in vitro [49] . In cultured murine macrophages, melatonin has been found to inhibit nitric oxide production due to a reduction in iNOS steady-state mRNA levels and iNOS protein expression [50] .",

Melatonin stimulated the endogenous production of IL-1b and reduced the concentration of TNF-a in the brain of these infected mice [57] . Elevations of IL-b levels in the brain have been detected in several viral infections of the CNS, such as those produced by the human immunodeficiency virus [58] , simian immunodeficiency virus [59] , SFV [60] , rabies virus [61] , and Sindbis virus [62] . However, these studies did not directly examine whether IL-1b plays a protective or deleterious role in CNS viral infections. Liang et al. [63] compared the natural histories of deficient and wild-type 129 SV (ev) mice infected with a neurovirulent viral strain, neuroadapted Sindbis virus. Their results suggest that IL-1b deficiency is protective against fatal Sindbis virus infection. In contrast, mice deficient in IL-1b have increased susceptibility to influenza virus [64] , and in poxvirus animal models the viral induction of this cytokine is also beneficial for the host [65] .",

The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it is possible to envision that during the VEE viral infection certain degenerating neurons that contain substance P might release this neuropeptide, which subsequently induces the release of IL-1b and TNF-a from monocytes [66] , which can then infiltrate the CNS from the blood [67] . Microglia proliferate and phagocytose local neuronal debris, resulting in microglial synthesis of IL-1b [67, 68] , which in turn induces the expression of adhesion molecules on local endothelium, favoring transmigration of lymphocytes and monocytes [69] . The increase in IL-1b levels produced by melatonin would provide neuronal support and protection by inducing nerve growth factor secretion by astrocytes [70] , thereby supplying a trophic factor for many neuronal cell types in times of stress, such as that produced by the VEE virus infection.",

Astrocyte-derived TNF-a can induce intercellular adhesion molecules on neighboring endothelial cells [80] , alter blood-brain barrier permeability, and promote inflammatory infiltration into the CNS [81] . Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the highly significant decrease in the concentration of brain TNF-a produced by melatonin in mice infected with the VEE virus [57] is aimed at diminishing the inflammatory response in the CNS and at correcting the alteration in blood-brain barrier permeability.

This interleukin has been considered one of the earliest host mediators during infectious diseases of the CNS [88] . In these studies, the immunomodulatory properties of melatonin are evident and suggest this indoleamine as a therapeutic alternative to resist VEE and other viral diseases, including SARS as no antimicrobial agent has been proven to be effective for its treatment. The use of melatonin to treat SARS has been suggested by Shiu et al. [89] .",
