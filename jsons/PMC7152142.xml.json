Nucleoside RT inhibitors and NtRTI interact with the catalytic site (the substrate-binding site) of the RT enzyme, whereas NNRTI interact with an allosteric site located at a short distance from the catalytic site. For the NRTI and NtRTI to interact with the substrate-binding site, they need to be phosphorylated.3\n",

            "text": "All of the NRTI (zidovudine [AZT], didanosine [ddI], zalcitabine [ddC], stavudine [d4T], lamivudine [3TC], abacavir [ABC], and emtricitabine) can be considered as nucleoside analogues, and they act in a similar fashion. After they have been taken up by the cells, they are phosphorylated three times to the active triphosphate form, and they act as competitive inhibitors of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrates, which are used by the cell to make DNA. Unlike dNTP substrates, NRTI lack a 3\u2032-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. Once incorporated into the DNA chain, the absence of a 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, which normally forms the 5\u2032- to 3\u2032-phosphoester bond with the next nucleic acid, blocks further extension of the DNA by RT, resulting in DNA chain termination. The analogues cannot be cleaved from the active center and thus block the RT enzyme.3 Nucleoside analogues are not only accepted as false substrates by viral enzymes, but also by cellular enzymes, and this is the major cause of their toxicity. Zidovudine is the NRTI most studied in cats, including in vivo studies evaluating the clinical response of experimentally and naturally FIV-infected cats treated with the drug. Zidovudine can increase the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and improve clinical condition scores in FIV-infected cats; however, it can result in adverse effects, such as dose-dependent nonregenerative anemia and neutropenia.4, 5 In addition, mutations producing resistance against the drug can develop.4, 5 Therefore, a study evaluated nine NRTI to inhibit FIV replication in feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells.4 Six of these drugs (ABC, ddI, emtricitabine, 3TC, d4T, and AZT) had been previously evaluated in feline cells, and three (amdoxovir, racivir, and dexelvucitabine) had not. Significant differences among the drugs were not found, but based on the data obtained, amdoxovir, dexelvucitabine, and racivir appear to be options for future studies investigating their potential use in FIV-infected cats. Though pharmacological data for cats are not available for these drugs, cytotoxic properties of these compounds suggest they could likely be used in vivo at dosages comparable to that for AZT.4\n",

Most importantly, they contain a phosphonate group that cannot be cleaved by hydrolases (esterases), which would make it more difficult to cleave off these compounds, once incorporated at the 3\u2032-terminal end, compared with their regular nucleotide counterparts. Use of these compounds also results in DNA chain termination. One of these drugs, cidofovir, is active against virtually all DNA viruses, including polyoma-, papilloma-, adeno-, herpes-, and poxviruses. Cidofovir has been used for treatment of FHV-1 (see Feline Herpesvirus Type 1). Adefovir (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine [PMEA]) has a spectrum of activity that partially overlaps with cidofovir, in that both are active against herpesviruses, but adefovir is also active against hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B) and retroviruses, including FIV and FeLV. The antiviral activity spectrum of tenofovir (PMPA) is narrower than that of PMEA, in that it no longer extends to herpesviruses but is confined to hepadna- and retroviruses.6 This drug has been tested in vitro against FeLV (see Feline Leukemia Virus).",

One exception can be used in cats with FIV infection, the class of bicyclams (e.g., plerixafor). Plerixafor (1,1\u2032-[1,4-phenylenbismethylene]-bis(1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane)-octachloride dehydrate, [AMD3100], [JM3100]), is the prototype compound among the bicyclams. Bicyclams are dimeric low-molecular weight nonpeptidic compounds that bind selectively to the chemokine receptor CXCR4. This is the cell surface co-receptor used by both HIV and FIV for attachment and infection of susceptible CD4+ lymphocytes, and the amino acid sequences of human and feline CXCR4 are highly similar. Drug binding inhibits attachment of the viral envelope to the host cell. The efficacy of plerixafor against FIV was recently investigated in naturally FIV-infected cats that were treated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.7 Plerixafor was administered at 0.5 mg/kg SC every 12 hours. Treatment of FIV-infected cats with plerixafor caused a significant decrease in the provirus load but did not lead to improvement of clinical or immunological variables. A statistical decrease in serum magnesium levels was observed in the treatment group, without clinical consequences. No development of resistance of FIV isolates to plerixafor was found during the treatment period, making it a potential treatment for FIV-infected cats.7 Limited oral bioavailability and short half-life preclude clinical use of plerixafor in HIV infection,2, 7 but additional CXCR4 antagonists are under development and should be tested for efficacy against FIV when available.",

            "text": "The goal of antiviral therapy should be improvement of the cat's clinical status. This is not always correlated with virus replication, as measured by a plasma viral load.9 It has been suggested that antiretroviral therapy should be administered to FIV-infected cats in the later stages of the asymptomatic phase of infection, during which the cat does not show clinical signs and the immune system is relatively normal and more likely to respond to treatment.5 After experimental infection, when the CD4+/CD8+ ratio decreases, viral load increases markedly, and clinical signs of immunosuppression begin to appear. However, the situation in naturally infected cats is different, and the quality of life is not associated with the viral load.11 Therefore, it is debated at which time point antiviral therapy should be started and whether it should be administered to asymptomatic cats. In a recent study, antiretroviral therapy was initiated during the later stages of the asymptomatic phase of infection in naturally infected cats. The cats were defined as being in the later stages of the asymptomatic phase of infection when the CD4+/CD8+ ratio reached 0.9, because at this stage of infection, the viral load increased markedly, and clinical signs of immunosuppression began to appear. The ratios were calculated every 4 months for 2 to 5 years prior to initiation of the antiviral therapy, and viral loads of all cats were quantified once a year. The cats were randomly assigned to treatment groups of eight cats each. Treatment included combination therapy, but no placebo group was used, and the study was not blinded.5 The follow-up was performed over 1 year, through clinical evaluation and the determination of viral loads and CD4+/CD8+ ratios. Comparisons of pretreatment and post-treatment values from the cats were performed, as well as comparison of values between treatment groups. A combination of two NRTI (AZT + 3TC, 25 mg/kg every 12 hours orally [PO]) was compared to treatment with AZT alone (5 mg/kg every 12 hours PO). The combination of AZT and 3TC is often used in HIV-infected patients, given that both drugs show a synergistic effect. Treatment with AZT alone or in combination with 3TC induced a significant increase in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and a significant decrease in viral load within and among groups, with an even greater reduction with combination therapy than with AZT alone. Only mild side effects, including vomiting in one of eight cats, anorexia in two of eight cats, and anemia in one of eight cats, were seen with this treatment combination, but therapeutic interventions resolved the problems, and treatment did not have to be stopped.5 However, the lack of a control group and lack of blinding make the results of the study very difficult to interpret. Therefore, treatment of asymptomatic FIV-infected cats with antivirals cannot be generally recommended based on the currently available data. An earlier in vivo study was performed in experimentally FIV-infected cats that were treated with a high-dose AZT and 3TC combination (100 or 150 mg/kg/day PO for each drug). The combination had no anti-FIV activity in these chronically infected cats. Severe side effects, which included fever, anorexia, and marked hematologic changes, were observed in some of the cats with such high-dose dual-drug treatment, but the toxic effects were reversed when the dose was lowered to 20 mg/kg every 24 hours.12\n",

Unfortunately, hepatic aldehyde oxidase activity is basically absent in cats, which makes the pharmacokinetics of this drug complex and results in lower than expected plasma penciclovir concentrations despite administration of relatively high doses of famciclovir.20, 21 Despite this, studies evaluating famciclovir in vivo have shown it to be safe and efficacious for use in feline patients.20, 22 Cats experimentally infected with FHV-1 and receiving famciclovir 90 mg/kg PO three times daily for 21 days had significantly improved outcomes for systemic, ophthalmic, clinicopathologic, virologic, serologic, and histologic variables when compared with placebo-treated cats. Treatment was initiated on day zero, the same day the cats were infected.20 Even though this study did not mimic how cats with natural infection would be treated, results from a clinical case study suggested this drug is likely effective for treatment of clinical cases, though it was not blinded and placebo controlled.22 Clinical cases with primary ocular disease, rhinosinusitis, and dermatitis each attributed to FHV-1 (though not definitively diagnosed), were treated with famciclovir at doses of 62.5 mg PO once or twice daily for ocular herpetic disease or rhinosinusitis or up to 125 mg PO three times daily for dermatitis.

Moreover, they damage host cells, specifically resulting in bone marrow suppression. Therefore, they should not be used systemically.1 For good reviews of these topical drugs, see the reports of Maggs1 and Gould.24 Cidofovir, a member of the NtRTI class of drugs, has been tested for topical treatment of FHV-1 ocular disease but not for systemic use. It appears to be efficacious topically and is a newer drug (therefore it is included in this section). Cidofovir requires the typical two host-mediated phosphorylation steps without virally mediated phosphorylation.1 Its safety when given topically arises from its relatively high affinity for HSV DNA polymerase compared with human DNA polymerase. It is commercially available only in injectable form in the United States for treatment of a human betaherpesvirus. When applied topically as a 0.5% solution twice daily to cats experimentally infected with FHV-1, it led to reduced viral shedding and improvement of clinical disease compared to the placebo group.25 Its efficacy with only twice daily administration (despite being virostatic) is believed to be due to the long tissue half-lives of the metabolites of this drug. There are reports of its experimental topical use in humans and rabbits being associated with stenosis of the nasolacrimal duct, but this has not been shown in cats. The fact that a twice-daily topical treatment is sufficient, whereas all other topical antivirals require application every 3 to 4 hours, makes cidofovir a useful alternative for ocular topical treatment.1, 24, 25\n",

L-lysine bolus administration also reduced viral shedding in latently infected cats experimentally infected with FHV-1, following changes in husbandry and housing but not following corticosteroid administration. In vitro, lysine supplementation led to reduction of FHV-1 replication.1 Arginine exerts a substantial growth-promoting effect on FHV-1 and is an essential amino acid for viral protein synthesis, and lysine antagonizes this effect. Lysine and arginine competitively inhibit transport of each other by using a common transport system, and lysine induces arginase, an enzyme that causes the degradation of arginine. Arginine deficiency inhibits synthesis of infectious viral particles and downregulates synthesis of viral proteins. However, unlike the protocol for HSV-1-infected humans, owners of cats receiving lysine for FHV-1 should not be advised to restrict their cat's arginine intake1 because feeding a diet lacking L-arginine is associated with a severe risk of hyperammonemia and encephalopathy.30\n",

The 3CL protease inhibitors were more effective than the cathepsin inhibitors and when used in combination, these drugs had strong synergic effects. There have not been any in vivo studies with these drugs in cats to date. In one in vitro study, 16 antiviral compounds, including nucleoside analogues used to treat herpesviruses, NRTI used for HIV, and protease inhibitors also used for HIV, were tested for their ability to inhibit FCoV in cell culture.35 Among the 16 drugs tested, two showed significant inhibition of FCoV when compared to the untreated cells. These were nelfinavir and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA). Nelfinavir is a HIV protease inhibitor that has been shown to target the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV by interacting with 18 residues of the protease. The drug was slightly less effective against FCoV than against SARS-CoV, likely because only seven of the corresponding residues of the 3CL protease of FCoV are identical to the SARS-CoV protease.35 GNA, a carbohydrate-binding agent, exhibits its antiviral effect by binding to coronavirus glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, thereby inhibiting viral attachment to the host cell. The antiviral effects were concentration dependent, and nelfinavir displayed cellular toxicity at higher doses. GNA was a better inhibitor of FCoV, and when the two agents were added together, a synergistic antiviral effect was produced. The results suggest that the combined use of GNA and nelfinavir could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of cats with FIP.35\n",

An imbalance in T-cell versus B-cell immune response has been suggested to contribute to the development of FIP. It has been proposed that a strong cell-mediated immune response protects a cat from the development of FIP, whereas the production of antibodies is counterproductive, enhancing the uptake and replication of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in macrophages and contributing to the pathology by producing a type III hypersensitivity vasculitis. However, this hypothesis has been questioned.37 Therefore, even though the use of these types of drugs for stimulation of a cell-mediated response might seem a logical approach for the treatment of FIP, there is currently no data to support their use.",

Shedding of these viruses was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FHV-1 and FCoV) or conventional PCR (FCV and FPV). Pretreatment and post-treatment samples were compared. Feline calicivirus shedding was detected in 13 of 16 cats on day 0 and not detected on day 65. The amount of FHV-1 shedding was significantly reduced in the cats at the end of the study (day 65), compared with the beginning. Feline coronavirus shedding was reduced but not significantly, and there was not enough FPV detected in the population to draw any significant conclusions.41 However, there was no placebo group used for this study, and without a placebo group, it is difficult to determine definitively if the results are due to antiviral effects of IFN or are just consistent with the natural resolution of viral shedding.",

Feline herpesvirus type 1 shedding was lower, though not statistically significant, on day 14 compared with day 0 for all groups (including the placebo group), and clinical scores were significantly decreased on day 14 compared to day 0, again for all groups including the placebo group.46 Therefore, comparing results between days 0 and 14 in the treated cats without the inclusion of the placebo group would have resulted in a different conclusion for this study. These cats were not infected with FeLV, and even though the FIV status was unknown for all the cats, the ones that were tested were negative. However, this study highlights the need for a placebo group for accurate evaluation of the effect of IFN therapy on FHV-1 and FCV shedding and associated disease.",

Twenty-four cats were treated with the IFN, and the effect was compared with a positive control group that received a standard corticosteroid therapy. The results suggested that the IFN therapy was as effective as the corticosteroid treatment for this condition for improvement in clinical signs.43 Feline calicivirus viral loads were not evaluated in this study, and there was no placebo group used for comparison. However, assuming the IFN therapy was the cause of the improvement seen in these cats, the results add to the hypothesis that improvement in oral lesions in FIV- and/or FeLV-infected cats likely is associated with the effect of IFN on opportunistic viral infections. Differences in the outcome of the different studies could be due to different application methods (e.g., ocular versus oral); however, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn without additional studies that also evaluate viral load in naturally infected cats that are randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded.",

In a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blinded treatment trial, 37 cats with FIP were treated with rFeIFN-omega or placebo.47 In all cats, FIP was confirmed by histology and/or immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining of FCoV antigen in effusion or tissue macrophages. All cats received glucocorticoids, either as dexamethasone in case of effusion (1 mg/kg intrathoracic or intraperitoneal injection every 24 hours) or prednisolone (2 mg/kg PO every 24 hours). Cats also received either a placebo or rFeIFN-omega at 106 IU/kg SC every 24 hours for 8 days and subsequently once a week. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean survival time of cats treated with rFeIFN-omega versus the placebo. Cats survived for a period of 3 to 200 days before euthanasia with a mean survival time of 18 days. There was only one long-term survivor (>3 months) in the rFeIFN-omega group. Interferon treatment might be more effective if started earlier, but this is not of relevance in the treatment of cats with FIP in the field.47 However, IFN therapy might be useful for treatment of cats with chronic FCoV shedding, but further studies are required. As previously mentioned, treatment with rFeIFN-omega (licensed SC protocol) was associated with a decrease in FCoV shedding in FIV- and/or FeLV-infected cats; however, the results were not compared with a placebo group.41\n",
