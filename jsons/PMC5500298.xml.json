The content of oxalate is high in many plant foods, including vegetables, cereal grains, nuts, beans and beverages. For example, oxalate concentrations (mg/100 g) in fresh spinach, dried soy beans, dried peanuts, and dried wheat bran are 400\u2013900 mg, 82\u2013214 mg, 96\u2013705 mg and 457 mg, respectively (Massey, 2007). Daily oxalate intake is typically 80\u2013120 mg/day; however, it can range from 44 to 350 mg/day in individuals who eat typical Western diets (Holmes and Kennedy, 2000). Most plant-based foods contain various quantities of oxalate. Oxalate content can also vary widely within the same plant species due to growth seasons, soil and water conditions (Massey, 2007, Holmes and Kennedy, 2000).",

Oxalic acid-degrading bacteria have been found in feces of humans (Abratt and Reid, 2010); however the extent to which they degrade oxalic acid in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans is either unknown or inconclusive. One gut bacteria that has been investigated as a therapeutic is Oxalobacter formigenes. This organism uses oxalate as its major energy and carbon source. Anywhere from 1 to 22% of ingested oxalate is absorbed in humans, depending on source, dose and state (fed or fasting) (Noonan and Savage, 1999). Oxalate is a known chelating agent for metal cations and dietary oxalate may form magnesium, iron or calcium salts in food or the GI tract (Asplin, 2002, Israr et al., 2013). Consequently, unabsorbed oxalate can form salts with the aforementioned minerals in the GI tract, promoting mineral excretion in feces and reducing the potential for essential mineral absorption (Noonan and Savage, 1999).",

            "text": "Oxalate may be absorbed throughout the entire GI tract, beginning at the stomach (Hautmann, 1993, Chen et al., 2003). The concentration of oxalate in serum of humans consuming typical Western diets is between 1 and 6 \u03bcM; much lower than the saturation concentration (Porowski et al., 2008). However, due to water re-absorption in the kidney, oxalate concentration in urine increases over 100 times, usually in the range of 0.1\u20130.5 mM (Sakhaee, 2009). Urinary calcium concentration is normally about 10 times that of oxalate concentration (Pak et al., 2004). Therefore, urinary calcium oxalate is often supersaturated, which is usually described by the supersaturation ratio, a number being approximately the ratio of the salt concentration in the urine to its solubility. When a salt concentration in a solution is higher than its solubility, salt will start to precipitate at a certain concentration, which is called the upper limit of metastability (Coe et al., 2005). The upper limit of calcium oxalate metastability varies with urine conditions such as other ions, macromolecules and urine pH. By reducing oxalate and/or increasing citrate intake and/or encouraging at least 2 L of urine output per year the salt concentration in urine can be kept below the upper limit of metastability; thus, allowing for normal variations of urine ion, macromolecule and pH conditions without introducing an abnormal level of calcium oxalate precipitate formation. It is believed that calcium oxalate supersaturation and lack of hydration are the drivers of calcium oxalate stone formation, although the process is complex, not completely clear and may involve several other critical factors including urinary macromolecules, bile acids and renal tubular damage (Tsujihata, 2008, Porowski et al., 2008, Coe et al., 2005, Matlaga et al., 2007, Saso et al., 2001).",

Oxalate avoidance is difficult because oxalate is present in many different foods and levels of oxalate in a single food are variable (Holmes and Kennedy, 2000). Therefore, it is challenging to find foods that keep oxalate ingestion low without compromising nutritional balance. Bong and coworkers recently demonstrated that calcium chloride can successfully remove a significant portion of soluble oxalate from processed spinach (Bong et al., 2017). Herein, an enzyme approach is presented that is effective at reducing/removing both soluble and insoluble oxalate from a variety of foods and beverages.",

Mammary gland adenocarcinomas have been reported in Sprague-Dawley rats as young as twelve weeks of age (Kuzutani et al., 2012). The age-dependent frequency of mammary adenocarcinoma findings makes it difficult to give robust quantitative statements. However, based upon experience at PSL adenocarcinomas are equally likely to be observed in control groups as they are treatment groups. Therefore, one or two adenocarcinomas in treatment groups are not considered to be test substance-related. The statistically significant increase in mid dose male spleen-to-body weight ratio and decrease in high dose female absolute brain weight did not correlate with any histopathological or clinical pathology findings, and there was no effect of the test material on any test of neurological function.

Based on an optimal activity of 90 Units (\u03bcmol/min)/mg Nephure\u2122, the added mean and 90th percentile Nephure\u2122 consumption in terms of Units of enzymatic activity will be 518.4 Units/day (8.64 Units/kg bw/day) and 1114.2 Units/day (18.57 Units/kg bw/day). Thus, in 90th percentile consumers, addition of Nephure\u2122 to the foods stated in Table 9 could potentially degrade 1114.2 \u03bcmol oxalate (98 mg, based on a molecular weight of oxalate of 88.019 g/mol) in one minute.",

High blood levels of formate are thought to be responsible for the optic nerve damage and metabolic acidosis that occurs in methanol poisoning. Hallmarks of formate toxicity include decreases in blood potassium and bicarbonate, hyperpnea, and visual impairment (Eells et al., 1996, Mahieu et al., 1989). Certified 2016 Harlan Teklad Global Rodent Diet\u00ae, was selected due to its high oxalate content of 880 mg oxalate/kg of diet. Assuming that 100% of the oxalate is degraded to formate the resulting exposure would be 26 and 32 mg formate/kg bw/day for male and female rats, respectively, far exceeding the predicted human exposure. Importantly, there was no effect of Nephure\u2122 on blood potassium or bicarbonate levels and no clinical, ophthalmological or behavioral findings suggestive of formate toxicity.",

The results of the studies described in this manuscript show that Nephure\u2122 is not genotoxic and is not toxic to Sprague Dawley rats at the dose levels provided. Under the conditions of the study and based on the toxicological endpoints evaluated, the no-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for oral administration of Nephure\u2122 was 475 mg/kg/day (33,250 Units/kg bw/day), the highest dose evaluated for both male and female rats. When added to certain foods to decrease oxalate intake, Nephure\u2122 is estimated to be consumed at 12.38 mg/day at the 90th percentile of intake, which equates to approximately 1114.2 Units/day (18.57 Units/kg bw/day). Up to 3450 Units of activity/day (57.5 Units of activity/kg bw/day) can be safely consumed from addition of Nephure\u2122 to food to reduce the intake of dietary oxalate. S. elongates and the E. coli strain used in this work are not known to produce allergenic proteins, and potential cross-reactivity of the Nephure\u2122 protein sequence with known allergens is low, based on homology screening.
