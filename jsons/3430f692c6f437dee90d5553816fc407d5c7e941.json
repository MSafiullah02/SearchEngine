Personally, I feel this work addresses an important problem, the authors introduce the problem well, use established methods, present their findings clearly, and discuss the weaknesses of the work fairly. I was a little skeptical as to how they would use the IUCN data and how 'novel' their framework was [see abstract], as these data have significant weaknesses. However, I thought the authors used them well and quite imaginatively to come to conclusions that had until recently largely been discussed, but not rigorously analysed in the literature.",

These two issues are of major concern globally and have been in direct conflict in several occasions in recent years, when zoonotic spillover from wildlife has triggered culling campaigns opposed by conservationists. As illustrated by the controversies around flying foxes and Hendra virus in Australia, badgers and bovins TB in Great Britain, or bats and rabies in South America, to cite but a few, cultural and sociological factors exacerbate these conflicts and prevent their resolution, with both sides cherry-picking the scientific evidence and economic factors that align with their beliefs. What this study brings is a dispassionate and global analysis of the relationship that exist between the occurrence of zoonotic viruses and conservation status. The inclusion of sources of threat enables the authors to propose a mechanistic interpretation of the statistical association. Even though precise causation and reliable solutions are beyond the scope of this analysis, the results presented here will be very valuable to inform the debate and guide more detailed investigations of the processes underlying zoonotic spillover and wildlife population variations.",

I am aware that this has been done previously for rodents, bats and smaller groups of taxa, but if this is really the first database of its kind for mammals, then it should be clarified further within the manuscript and celebrated as a contribution in its own right.

The manuscript feels like the analysis have been run without any particular hypotheses of how these interactions might be occurring under different circumstances e.g. common but rapidly declining species vs rarer but stable species. Other presumably important factors are not considered, for example, how habitat type and habitat/dietary specialisation might correlate with human contact. Similarly, urbanisation favours survival of generalist over specialist species, and this is likely reflected in human contacts (more contacts for generalist species that thrive in urban environments), even if their overall population metrics and threat measures remain the same. The focus of the text seems to switch between which groups of species \"harbour the most zoonotic viruses\" versus which are of greater spillover risk, and I argue that these are not the same things. Detectability and contact rates with humans will both play a significant role.",

I don't think that zoonotic diseases comprise the majority of emerging infectious disease threats to wildlife (consider Bd in amphibians, WNS in North American bats, DFTD in Tasmanian devils, Avian Malaria, Canine Distemper etc). Lines 28-55: This is a long paragraph with lots of ideas that don't easily flow. I feel that it could be edited to be more concise and more quickly get to the point. e.g. lines 32-38. Also, to attract the broader readership that is expected for Proc B, I suggest including a few words to define zoonotic. Lines 38-42 -is the focus of the paper on spillover or pandemic potential? There is no further mention of pandemics through the text and the focus on pandemic potential seems irrelevant. I suggest either rephrasing in terms of spillover potential or deleting. Lines 49 -51 -clarify whether high or low body mass or human population density increases/decreases propensity to share viruses with humans Line 51 -high risk as determined by what metric? This is a bit confusing. Suggest deleting \"Within specific high risk taxa\" from sentence Line 52 -Replace 'numbers' with 'detections' or similar. We have no idea how many viruses most species have -can can only judge what has been detected. Lines 71-73 -As discussed in general comments above, this assumption requires further justification from an ecological perspective. Lines 73-74 Provide an example here of the types of contact being referred to Line 75 -this is the first time that the focus has shifted to mammals. Provide justification for this. Also clarify here that the focus is on terrestrial species Line 80-81-the results of the study don't have implications for the the risk of spillover per se -it has implications for understanding the risk, or for managing the risk. Line 93-102 -A table would be helpful to summarise the IUCN threat categories and how they link with assumed abundance. It is unclear what \"criteria A1-4 by sub-criteria a, b, c, d, e\" means, for example. I got completely lost in the remainder of this paragraph Line 153 -In general, the authors should be cautious of saying Species with X characteristic have more zoonotic viruses. Despite trying to account for biases, there are still detection issues there, and phrasing should reflect that (as suggested in the abstract) Line 159 -should this be \"one or more of the zoonotic viruses\" Line 160 -(58.8%, n= 84) Line 161 -quantify what is meant by 'vast majority' Figure 1 -It is unclear which circles the lines are pointing to in B.

Lines 167-169 -Clarify what proportion of all terrestrial mammalian species these orders represent. Table 1 : In assessing the effect of \"Least Concern increasing\", it is unclear in the text whether includes or accounts for domestic species or not (lines 195-197) . Table 1 : Suggest present this from top to bottom in order of importance -i.e. as outlined in lines 187-189. Also, the final model structure is not given, and it is unclear whether the effects presented take into account the hierarchical structure of the data e.g. only threatened species are classified under \"IUCN Criteria for Threatened Status\" Line 303 -304 -The wording here is helpful to clarify that effects being reported take into account other effects, but this is not mentioned elsewhere. Figure 2 : It took me a while to see that the lines were connecting the animal silhouettes to the relevant circles for that species. A minor edit that might better highlight this would be to delete the grey lines after they pass (i.e. above) the silhouettes so it looks more like a line connecting to the silhouette. It is also confusing to have these silhouettes overlapping with the (long) Population size reduction text. I suggest abbreviating this text to a few words in the figure, and have the full description in the Figure caption. I think it would also assist digestibility of the figure if the four categories in blue were also labelled A-D. Lines 276 -321 -Much of the text in this section is discussion, not results.

Domesticated species contribute far more zoonoses than terrestrial mammalian wildlife species (lines 262-267) . This should be the main finding, and any mention of the smaller effects of population size or IUCN status (which the authors are putting forward as the main finding) should be placed within that context. Of the fraction of zoonotic viruses that come from wildlife, significant effects of population size and threat status are evident, but how many viruses/how much risk does this represent in real terms?

There has been greater opportunity for those to spillover into people, however the results for the threat categories show that that certain circumstances just allow us to be aware of the zoonotic viruses present in less abundant species.

There is no mention of the force of infection from domestic animals here. Additionally, I accept that it is difficult to study, and outside of the scope of this manuscript, but the number of zoonotic viruses from any given species does not reflect the burden of disease in people.

I was a little skeptical as to how they would use the IUCN data and how 'novel' their framework was [see abstract], as these data have significant weaknesses. However, I thought the authors used them well and quite imaginatively to come to conclusions that had until recently largely been discussed, but not rigorously analysed in the literature.",

Maybe refer explicitly to critical community sizes, whilst also acknowledging that other transmission processes exist (e.g. frequency dependent transmission), and see: These results are interesting and important as they cast light on the complex relationship between two facets fo the human-wildlife relationship: conservation and zoonotic spillover. These two issues are of major concern globally and have been in direct conflict in several occasions in recent years, when zoonotic spillover from wildlife has triggered culling campaigns opposed by conservationists. As illustrated by the controversies around flying foxes and Hendra virus in Australia, badgers and bovins TB in Great Britain, or bats and rabies in South America, to cite but a few, cultural and sociological factors exacerbate these conflicts and prevent their resolution, with both sides cherry-picking the scientific evidence and economic factors that align with their beliefs.

Other presumably important factors are not considered, for example, how habitat type and habitat/dietary specialisation might correlate with human contact. Similarly, urbanisation favours survival of generalist over specialist species, and this is likely reflected in human contacts (more contacts for generalist species that thrive in urban environments), even if their overall population metrics and threat measures remain the same.

I don't think that zoonotic diseases comprise the majority of emerging infectious disease threats to wildlife (consider Bd in amphibians, WNS in North American bats, DFTD in Tasmanian devils, Avian Malaria, Canine Distemper etc).

Also, to attract the broader readership that is expected for Proc B, I suggest including a few words to define zoonotic. Lines 38-42 -is the focus of the paper on spillover or pandemic potential? There is no further mention of pandemics through the text and the focus on pandemic potential seems irrelevant. I suggest either rephrasing in terms of spillover potential or deleting.

A minor edit that might better highlight this would be to delete the grey lines after they pass (i.e. above) the silhouettes so it looks more like a line connecting to the silhouette. It is also confusing to have these silhouettes overlapping with the (long) Population size reduction text. I suggest abbreviating this text to a few words in the figure, and have the full description in the Figure caption.

Domesticated species contribute far more zoonoses than terrestrial mammalian wildlife species (lines 262-267). This should be the main finding, and any mention of the smaller effects of population size or IUCN status (which the authors are putting forward as the main finding) should be placed within that context.

I really enjoyed reading this very nice work, which is well written and reached sound conclusions based on clear and simple results. Reading the manuscript is easy, and the work in general is based on appropriate statistical methods, i.e., general linearized mixed modeling. However, I have several concerns about the use of statistical methods and the context of their employment by the authors. 1. It is still hard to follow the statistical explanation even if the authors made an effort in this new amended version of their manuscript. I do understand that they used a forward regression procedure to reach a final model, i.e., a minimal model, but they poorly explained this in the document. I understand that the final model is minimal, best explained equation-s, but this should be clearly discussed. The authors should better explained what they really did for the reader (see following comment). 2. Associated with this first comment, forward regression modeling is highly sensitive to the introduction of the first independent variable in the model, and in particular in the case where this-ese variable-s is-are non-continuous variable-s, e.g., ordinal, categorical, dichotomous. In general it is better to use forward and backward procedures separately, and then compare and discuss results obtained, or to use stepwise regression procedures. In addition, I am not sure that permutations of independent variables have been done in this work, since forward modeling is very sensitive to the introduction of the first variable. I would recommend the authors to do this proceeding to changing ranking order of independent variables introduced in the GLMM models, and see what happens. 3. Final, minimal models retained are zero-inflated Poisson regression models, and the authors used other types of models e.g., zero-inflated negative binomial regression models as well, and I am curious to see the differences observed between the different models. This could appear as a supplementary material. Model fitting for this category of dependent variable distribution is generally difficult, with lack or difficulty of convergence, so presenting the different results obtained could be important for the reader. 4. The discussion/conclusion section should discuss about the spatial scale of this study and the results obtained, and replace them within the framework of hierarchical systems; determinants that are observed/obtained at one hierarchical level can be different for other scales. This is true for global species abundances as predictors of zoonotic virus species (so at global scale), but local mammal species abundance can be or not correlated to global mammal species abundance and appear not to be a good predictor of local zoonotic virus diversity. The authors should better discuss this point in this section.",

In this way, the authors would explicitly test for the importance of conservation status in driving the richness of zoonotic viruses hosted by a particular species.

If you are unable to meet this deadline please let us know as soon as possible, as we may be able to grant a short extension. Comments to the Author(s). I have now read the manuscript entitled Global shifts in mammalian declines reveal key predictors of virus spillover risk by Johnson and collaborators, and submitted to Proceedings B, London. I really enjoyed reading this very nice work, which is well written and reached sound conclusions based on clear and simple results. Reading the manuscript is easy, and the work in general is based on appropriate statistical methods, i.e., general linearized mixed modeling. However, I have several concerns about the use of statistical methods and the context of their employment by the authors. 1. It is still hard to follow the statistical explanation even if the authors made an effort in this new amended version of their manuscript. I do understand that they used a forward regression procedure to reach a final model, i.e., a minimal model, but they poorly explained this in the document. I understand that the final model is minimal, best explained equation-s, but this should be clearly discussed. The authors should better explained what they really did for the reader (see following comment). 2. Associated with this first comment, forward regression modeling is highly sensitive to the introduction of the first independent variable in the model, and in particular in the case where this-ese variable-s is-are non-continuous variable-s, e.g., ordinal, categorical, dichotomous. In general it is better to use forward and backward procedures separately, and then compare and discuss results obtained, or to use stepwise regression procedures. In addition, I am not sure that permutations of independent variables have been done in this work, since forward modeling is very sensitive to the introduction of the first variable. I would recommend the authors to do this proceeding to changing ranking order of independent variables introduced in the GLMM models, and see what happens. 3. Final, minimal models retained are zero-inflated Poisson regression models, and the authors used other types of models e.g., zero-inflated negative binomial regression models as well, and I am curious to see the differences observed between the different models. This could appear as a supplementary material. Model fitting for this category of dependent variable distribution is generally difficult, with lack or difficulty of convergence, so presenting the different results obtained could be important for the reader. 4. The discussion/conclusion section should discuss about the spatial scale of this study and the results obtained, and replace them within the framework of hierarchical systems; determinants that are observed/obtained at one hierarchical level can be different for other scales. This is true for global species abundances as predictors of zoonotic virus species (so at global scale), but local mammal species abundance can be or not correlated to global mammal species abundance and appear not to be a good predictor of local zoonotic virus diversity. The authors should better discuss this point in this section.",

In my opinion, this article will be of broad interest for the Proc b readership and I anticipate that it could be highly cited because it establishes a link between species conservation and human health. I hope the authors find my comments useful. The authors have done a great job responding to comments from previous reviewers. After carefully reviewing the previous version of the article and the author's responses my major concern with its current presentation comes from the lack of methodological details to allow for replication of the analyses and the presentation of some results, which require attention.",

What do the authors mean by \"disease detection capabilities\u2026\"? If it refers to the difficulties to detect infectious agents in wild species I suggest rephrasing, since the concept of disease refers to an altered physiological state experienced by an organism that affects its health not to the presence of an infectious agent in the organism.

A clearer description of the methods is crucial to allow for replication of the analysis and therefore results. It is also necessary since there is no code is associated to the manuscript for readers to replicate the analysis. In particular, the model formulations are confusing to me based on the narrative. For instance, from table S1, I understand that the whole dataset was used, however IUCN criteria for threatened species only applies to the subset of species (lines 52 -67) with the levels of \"VU, EN and CE\" in the variable \"Trends in Species Declines\" (Table S1 ). I have a major concern about how the categorization of IUCN red list status and population trend (Table 1 , and named as Trends in Species declines in table S1) were incorporated in the analysis. If I understand well, these variables were included in the models as categorical predictors ignoring their ordinal nature (e.g. commonly species would progress gradually in their categorization from the lowest to highest conservation concern (or vice versa). A potential approach to consider this is to include the conservation categories as numeric variables (and different transformations to take into account potential non-linearity) from, for instance 1 for the category with the lowest risk of extinction to 12 to the highest extinction risk (Critically endangered). In this way, the authors would explicitly test for the importance of conservation status in driving the richness of zoonotic viruses hosted by a particular species. The suggested 'treatment' of this variable is further supported by the author's statement that conservation categories are proxies of species abundances (lines 103 -105) which is of continuous numeric nature.",

I suggest to present the \u0394AIC calculated as (AICfitted -AICfull) in this way the sign of the \u0394AIC would show direct relationship with \"better or worse fit\" as negative values would relate to lower AIC than the full model and therefore \"better fit\". In addition, I suggest reorganizing the rows from the most supported model (full in this case) to the least supported one. Figure 1B : the inclusion of humans in the plot makes it difficult to visualize the other groups. I suggest removing the human species from the plot. This would help communicate how the abundance of other species relates to the proportion of total zoonotic viruses they host. Lines 283 -286. I find the reference to figure 2 confusing. The sentence refers to the model outcomes (\"predictions\") which are the coefficients, therefore I was expecting Figure 2 to show the model estimates (coefficients). However, the figure shows the 'raw' number of viruses shared between different taxa (by conservation status) and humans. I suggest referring to figure 2 to report the raw number of zoonotic viruses by group and maybe, include a replicate of figure 2 reporting the model estimates. Lines 286 -297.

Personally, I feel this work addresses an important problem, the authors introduce the problem well, use established methods, present their findings clearly, and discuss the weaknesses of the work fairly. I was a little skeptical as to how they would use the IUCN data and how 'novel' their framework was [see abstract], as these data have significant weaknesses. However, I thought the authors used them well and quite imaginatively to come to conclusions that had until recently largely been discussed, but not rigorously analysed in the literature.",

For example, the bat lyssaviruses Lagos bat virus, Shimoni bat virus, West Caucasian bat virus and Aravan virus have not, as far as I am aware, been isolated from people.

As illustrated by the controversies around flying foxes and Hendra virus in Australia, badgers and bovins TB in Great Britain, or bats and rabies in South America, to cite but a few, cultural and sociological factors exacerbate these conflicts and prevent their resolution, with both sides cherry-picking the scientific evidence and economic factors that align with their beliefs. What this study brings is a dispassionate and global analysis of the relationship that exist between the occurrence of zoonotic viruses and conservation status. The inclusion of sources of threat enables the authors to propose a mechanistic interpretation of the statistical association. Even though precise causation and reliable solutions are beyond the scope of this analysis, the results presented here will be very valuable to inform the debate and guide more detailed investigations of the processes underlying zoonotic spillover and wildlife population variations.",

Because we expected reporting bias to be an important factor in ascertaining number of zoonotic viruses, we thought best to have one measure of reporting bias that was reflective of uncertainty in the data source used to categorize species by population trend. We also established an independent measure of data deficiency at the species level by including a term for the number of research publications available in PubMed. We found that both terms were needed to adjust for detection of zoonotic viruses in a species in multivariable modeling. Data from PREDICT supports the premise that very high search effort is needed to detect viruses in target virus families, but data are unfortunately not comparable to the zoonotic virus dataset or adequate with respect to data deficient species to enable direct testing of this assumption.",

The manuscript feels like the analysis have been run without any particular hypotheses of how these interactions might be occurring under different circumstances e.g. common but rapidly declining species vs rarer but stable species. Other presumably important factors are not considered, for example, how habitat type and habitat/dietary specialisation might correlate with human contact. Similarly, urbanisation favours survival of generalist over specialist species, and this is likely reflected in human contacts (more contacts for generalist species that thrive in urban environments), even if their overall population metrics and threat measures remain the same. The focus of the text seems to switch between which groups of species \"harbour the most zoonotic viruses\" versus which are of greater spillover risk, and I argue that these are not the same things. Detectability and contact rates with humans will both play a significant role. We agree and revisions were made accordingly. Specifically, consideration of habitat and diet specialization were included in the discussion as follows \" Many of these species have habitat and dietary niches that overlap with human dwellings and agriculture, further enabling direct and indirect contact with similarly adapted sympatric species, domesticated species, and humans. \" Specific mention of generalist species in context of increased human contact was included in the discussion with a new reference as follows \"Species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range despite large scale anthropogenically driven landscape change and urbanization (36) , are more likely to be generalist species that have adapted to humandominated landscapes, Specifically, we added We also revised text to ensure consistency in reference to species harboring zoonotic viruses.

Domesticated species contribute far more zoonoses than terrestrial mammalian wildlife species (lines 262-267). This should be the main finding, and any mention of the smaller effects of population size or IUCN status (which the authors are putting forward as the main finding) should be placed within that context.

The change in AIC was used to compare model fit for nested models with and without the variable of interest. In AIC value comparisons, main effects with a higher number of categories, such as population status categories (6 categories) and IUCN criteria (5 categories), will be penalized for complexity more than variables with only one category (domestication status) or continuous variables (ln PubMed hits). Domestication status, IUCN criteria, and population status all had similar delta AIC values. Based on improved model fit for each parameter, all of the variables in the final model were needed to explain variation in number of zoonotic viruses and were significantly related to this outcome.

If I understand well, these variables were included in the models as categorical predictors ignoring their ordinal nature (e.g. commonly species would progress gradually in their categorization from the lowest to highest conservation concern (or vice versa). A potential approach to consider this is to include the conservation categories as numeric variables (and different transformations to take into account potential non-linearity) from, for instance 1 for the category with the lowest risk of extinction to 12 to the highest extinction risk (Critically endangered). In this way, the authors would explicitly test for the importance of conservation status in driving the richness of zoonotic viruses hosted by a particular species. The suggested 'treatment' of this variable is further supported by the author's statement that conservation categories are proxies of species abundances (lines 103 -105) which is of continuous numeric nature.",

Also non-linearity would not be apparent to us in handling of the data. Furthermore, 2,218 species could not be included within a scale of species status because they were \"data deficient\". We addressed this comment in the following ways: Firstly, we renamed this variable that combines IUCN red list and population trends categories as \"conservation status\" throughout the manuscript for consistency. Table 1 was revised to reflect this variable name as \"conservation status\" and this header now matches the variable name in the model shown in Table 2 . The \"conservation status\" categories were re-ordered in Table 1 to reflect their ordinal nature. Additional changes to the Methods included adding \"Mammalian species were thus assigned levels in a new variable, conservation status, reflective of their combined measures of threatened status, population trend, and data deficiency (Table 1) , which were included as dichotomous variables in the multivariable analyses.\" Secondly, as suggested, we re-evaluated \"conservation status\" as a numerical variable for all species not classified as data deficient. Because this could only be done for a subset of data, we added this analysis to the Supplementary Materials as follows . . . \"Linear correlation between species conservation status and zoonotic virus richness: We evaluated the linear relationship between conservation status and zoonotic virus richness by converting ordered categories of conservation status into a numerical value and assessing the overall correlation between conservation status and zoonotic virus richness in a species using the non-parametric Spearman's rho statistic, for species not described as data deficient (n = 3117). The numerical scale of conservation status had a positive linear relationship with the number of zoonotic viruses reported in a species. Specifically, species with increasing population trends had more zoonotic viruses (without data deficient species; rho = 0.215, two-sided P < 0.001).\" We also included a sentence in the Results in the main text to refer to this analysis \"In an additional analysis of a subset of species that were not found to be data deficient, we found conservation status had a positive linear relationship with the number of zoonotic viruses reported in a species (Supplemental Materials) .\"",

I have now read the manuscript entitled Global shifts in mammalian declines reveal key predictors of virus spillover risk by Johnson and collaborators, and submitted to Proceedings B, London. I really enjoyed reading this very nice work, which is well written and reached sound conclusions based on clear and simple results. Reading the manuscript is easy, and the work in general is based on appropriate statistical methods, i.e., general linearized mixed modeling.However, I have several concerns about the use of statistical methods and the context of their employment by the authors.1. It is still hard to follow the statistical explanation even if the authors made an effort in this new amended version of their manuscript. I do understand that they used a forward regression procedure to reach a final model, i.e., a minimal model, but they poorly explained this in the document. I understand that the final model is minimal, best explained equation-s, but this should be clearly discussed. The authors should better explained what they really did for the reader (see following comment).The statistical methods section was overhauled for clarity, including more overt descriptions of our dependent and independent variables in each step of the methods, as well our procedure to identify the minimal best explained equation as suggested.2. Associated with this first comment, forward regression modeling is highly sensitive to the introduction of the first independent variable in the model, and in particular in the case where this-ese variable-s is-are noncontinuous variable-s, e.g., ordinal, categorical, dichotomous. In general it is better to use forward and backward procedures separately, and then compare and discuss results obtained, or to use stepwise regression procedures. In addition, I am not sure that permutations of independent variables have been done in this work, since forward modeling is very sensitive to the introduction of the first variable. I would recommend the authors to do this proceeding to changing ranking order of independent variables introduced in the GLMM models, and see what happens.We appreciate this comment -we re-evaluated the model building procedure to again evaluate alternative models and assess the best fit model as suggested. The final model was not sensitive to variation in variable selection and we arrived at the same final model each time. We thus clarified the approach described in the statistical analyses to ensure repeatability in our methods. In the main text Methods section, we added \"Model building was initiated with log number of PubMed publications, and then variables were entered into the model using forward stepwise entry with all categories of a variable being entered at one time, starting with species status categories, then criteria for listing, then domestication status. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown for the final ZIP model ( Table S2 . We also show the best fit zero-inflated Poisson model without the variable representing number of publications in PubMed to indicate the influence reporting bias had on other variables related to virus richness in a species (Table S3) .\"",

Model fitting for this category of dependent variable distribution is generally difficult, with lack or difficulty of convergence, so presenting the different results obtained could be important for the reader.We have included alternate models in the Supplementary Materials, including our best fit zero-inflated negative binomial regression model as well as the final zero-inflated Poisson model without the correction for reporting bias so that differences between models can be directly compared. We also added this sentence to the methods in the main text \"We also show the alternate best fit model, a zero-inflated negative binomial model (Table S2) , as well the final ZIP model without the term log number of PubMed publications (Table S3) to show model sensitivity to reporting bias.\" 4. The discussion/conclusion section should discuss about the spatial scale of this study and the results obtained, and replace them within the framework of hierarchical systems; determinants that are observed/obtained at one hierarchical level can be different for other scales. This is true for global species abundances as predictors of zoonotic virus species (so at global scale), but local mammal species abundance can be or not correlated to global mammal species abundance and appear not to be a good predictor of local zoonotic virus diversity. The authors should better discuss this point in this section.",

General comments: As other reviewers have highlighted, the article by Johnson and colleagues has involved a significant effort, from compiling a dataset to systematizing information about zoonotic viral infections across mammals. In my opinion, this article will be of broad interest for the Proc b readership and I anticipate that it could be highly cited because it establishes a link between species conservation and human health. I hope the authors find my comments useful.The authors have done a great job responding to comments from previous reviewers. After carefully reviewing the previous version of the article and the author's responses my major concern with its current presentation comes from the lack of methodological details to allow for replication of the analyses and the presentation of some results, which require attention.Since the major advance of this work is related to assessing the importance of conservation status and population trends of mammalian species in explaining the number of virus shared with humans without exploring mechanistic relationships between mammalian declines and virus spillover events, I find the title a bit confusing or misleading up to some point. I suggest rephrasing the title to reflect the findings of the article better.Thank you for your review and comments; we addressed this suggestion by revising the title to \"Global shifts in mammalian population trends reveal key predictors of virus spillover risk\". This precision in language relating population trends to conservation status was revised throughout the paper. We have found these comments very helpful in improving the paper. We added a scale to the figure 2, which might not be much of an improvement to the figure. We have included the revised figure with a scale in the manuscript but think the figure is best presented as originally submitted. Figure 3 : I find this figure difficult to follow. In its current form, it does not allow the reader to visualize the level of connection (virus shared) among groups. I suggest removing the viruses as nodes in the network and instead use the thickness of the links to represent the number of viruses connecting the host groups (homologous to number of contacts among individuals in a social network), including humans. This would help readers visualize how well connected the different host species are but also their contribution to human infections individually and as groups.",

For example, if one virus was reported in 10 hosts, in a twomode network this is only 10 edges, but in a one-mode network this is 45 edges, i.e. a link between each of the 10 hosts. Because all viruses were zoonotic by definition, all hosts are connected to humans in the one-mode network and little else can be discerned. We thus resubmit our revised manuscript with the two-mode network to best illustrate the level of connectivity for viruses. We use centrality in the two-mode network to show a high level of connectivity between hosts (particularly as highlighted for domesticated species).

For instance, the discussion does not mention the role of primates and bats in the number of viruses shared with humans, which was presented in the results as a subheading. Please ignore this comment if lines 346 -361 are included as discussion material.We revised the headings to include discussion with results. This section is now labelled \"conclusions and future directions\".Line 381: I find the term \"community size\" a bit confusing. Does this refer to population size (same species of hosts) or the actual assembly of host species? I think that the first would be more appropriate for the context (?).This sentence was revised to facilitate readability to a broader audience as suggested \"Reservoir populations have a critical population or community size required for infectious disease transmission\".Lines 397 -403. Please add references to these statements.This finding is based on the data presented in the paper and our inferences, so this was rephrased as follows \"Many of species listed as least concern with increasing abundance trends by the IUCN Red List are adaptable wild mammalian species that have benefitted from a close relationship with humans. These species could have habitat and dietary niches that overlap with humans in dwellings or in agricultural practices, further enabling direct and indirect contact with similarly adapted sympatric species, domesticated species, and humans.\"Line 422: The assumption that a species is a competent host for spillover because it was seropositive is misplaced. An individual/species could be seropositive (exposed) but not a competent host (i.e. suitable for transmission), or not be of epidemiological relevance as a 'source' of infection. The authors must acknowledge how this assumption in the treatment of serology and PCR data could influence their inferences. One potential consequence could be an overestimation of species as a \"source\" of pathogens, especially in cases where multiple species may seroconvert, but only a few are main shedders. For example, in the case of Hendra virus in Australia, although Pteropus poliocephalus and other pteropid bats may be seropositive against the virus (supporting exposure), PCR results and viral isolation support that P. alecto and P. conspicillatus are the main reservoirs (see Field HE (2016) Hendra virus ecology and transmission, Current opinion in Virology, 16:120-125, and references). Based on this case (Hendra virus), the list of hosts presented in the supplementary information seems far-reaching and unsupported.We concur with this comment and have carefully stated our assumptions and the reasoning for these assumptions. We further revised our description of the data in the SI as follows \"The dataset of animal species associated with zoonotic viruses in this study is provided in Data file S1, which should be considered baseline data pending further investigations to confirm wild animal species as competent reservoirs or determine that some suspected host species are not epidemiologically important sources of spillover to humans. We propose re-evaluating epidemiological models of spillover risk in light of new data.\" In the main text, but especially in an expanded section in the SI, we compare inferences that can be made from molecular vs serological evidence. We also note that we have modeled the inclusion and exclusion of host serology data for flaviviruses and determined that this did not affect classification of which wildlife species were likely to host these viruses. Similarly, Olival et al. as referenced found that including or excluding serological data when quantifying virus richness per mammalian species did not alter predictions of how host and virus traits affect patterns of virus spillover from wild mammals to humans. Both over-and under-reporting of hosts for viruses remain a concern but we have drawn inferences following objective treatment of the data available and have been transparent about the nature of the data.Line 431 -432. I suggest adding a table similar to table S1, including the model formulations with and without the number of publications as variable. In this way, the authors would support the statement about the explanatory importance of the different variables being consistent.
