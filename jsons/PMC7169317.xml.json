It may be necessary to combine cytomorphology with specific disease markers to elucidate the underlying disease and collect predictive data.2 In contrast to histologic investigations, which allow for multiple tissue sections that can examine individual cells, repetitive impression smears and FNA of the same tissue can by no means reproduce the same composition of cells and tissue components.2 In addition to these technologic limitations, the type and distribution of a lesion can pose essential limitations to its holistic cytologic characterization. Thus, detectability is compromised if the lesion is (a) poorly exfoliative and of low cellularity; (b) affecting tissues that are difficult to access (eg, the central nervous system [CNS]) or comprised of sparse fluids (eg, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]); (c) has atypical cells and pathogens that are poorly dense or scantly distributed; and (d) has cells that are highly vulnerable to shearing stress.",

With the advancement of panoptic stains, special stains have mainly focused on the assessment of microbial and fungal organisms (eg, Ziehl\u2010Neelsen, Fite\u2010Faraco, Gram, Fontana\u2010Masson), mucins and polysaccharides (eg, Alcian blue, Periodic acid\u2010Schiff), iron pigments, and melanin (eg, Prussian blue reaction, Nile blue A, Fontana\u2010Masson).2 As cellular identification is rarely needed in these situations, ancillary staining often can be conducted on spare slides.2 Other infectious diseases and tumor cell antigens, however, could require preselection and cytomorphologic characterization of the cells to be stained.2, 3 This holds true, in particular, for advanced tumor diagnoses.3, 4 Immunocytochemistry (ICC) on Romansky\u2010stained (prestained) slides (poststaining ICC, PSICC) could help identify the histogenetic origin of tumors or cell types, characterize cells that cannot be identified with conventional stains, and obtain further prognostic and predictive information.3, 5, 6, 7, 8 For infectious diseases, PSICC is a promising tool for the intracellular detection of viral proteins. One of the most common situations is in the detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) for the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), in which the presence of intracellular viral antigens in macrophages must be demonstrated.9, 10 This approach requires preservation of both the target antigen and host cell morphology.",

The CD3 signal was strongest in the periphery of the lymphocyte cytoplasm close to the membrane. NeuN immunoreactivity was restricted to neuronal nuclei, while GFAP diffusely stained the soma and fragmented processes of astrocytes (procedure depicted in trial 6 without microwave treatment). B, The impact of xylene\u2010based coverslipping and decoverslipping appeared negligible. Hence, microwave treatment was not necessary (procedure depicted in trial 5 without microwave treatment). C, Prestaining with Wright's stain and then bleaching with hydrogen chloride abolished the specific immunostaining of all markers (blue arrow), if the slides were left uncoverslipped (procedure depicted in trial 3 without microwave treatment). D, Coverslipping after prestaining with a Wright's stain appeared superior in being able to preserve antigenicities and specific staining intensities (procedure depicted in trial 4 without microwave treatment). E, Microwave treatment completely rescued the compromising effects of staining/destaining and coverslipping/decoverslipping (procedure depicted in trial 4 with microwave treatment).
