Case presentation and treatment: A male centenarian with cough and dyspnea for 2 months was diagnosed with COVID-19. Without effective treatments and with the increased risks of antiviral therapy for the elderly, this patient was given convalescent plasma. The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient. Concurrently, SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased sharply after the first transfusion (from 2.55\u00d7104 to 1.39\u00d7103 copies/mL) and became undetectable after the second transfusion. Conclusions: With the substantial increase of COVID-19 in recent months,treatment for elderly patients has become restricted in some countries. The successful treatment of this 100-year-old patient using convalescent plasma suggests that we should consider adding convalescent plasma in th management of the elderly.",

            "text": "A 100-year-old male with a persistent cough, difficulty expectorating, and dyspnea for 2 months was admitted to a tertiary hospital due to COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province in Feb 2020. The patient was a local resident and had no obvious exposure to COVID-19. Initially, he received supportive care at a local geriatric hospital in December 2019. After receiving symptomatic treatment for one week to reduce his cough, the patient continued to suffer from shortness of breath. Two months later, in Feb 2020, the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 was performed for the patient at a community health center, and this test yielded a positive result. He was then admitted to a tertiary hospital in Wuhan. The patient had a significant past medical history, including a 30-year record of hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm, cerebral infarction, prostate hyperplasia, and complete loss of cognitive function for the preceding 3 years. Upon his hospital admission due to the COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient had stable vital signs, with a body temperature of 36.6 \u2103 ( Figure 1A ), pulse of 87 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 beats/min, blood pressure of 125/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He had the following laboratory findings: red blood cell and lymphocyte counts were relatively low at 3.47\u00d710 12 /L and 0.75\u00d710 9 /L, respectively, whereas white blood cell, neutrophil, and monocyte counts were within the normal range, at 4.5\u00d710 9 /L , 3.32\u00d710 9 /L, and 0.37\u00d710 9 /L, respectively. C-reactive protein was elevated at 108.43 mg/L. His fibrinogen level Following admission, the patient was given high-flow oxygen, nutritional support, and symptomatic treatment. Due to the patient's advanced age and increased risk for drug-induced toxicity, antiviral medications were not administered at that time. On day 5 of hospitalization, he had a relatively high SARS-CoV-2 viral load (2.55\u00d710 4 copies/mL) by quantitative RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab ( Figure 1B ). Because the patient was not suitable for antiviral treatment and there was no other effective therapy, the clinical team recommended that the patient receive convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma was collected via plasmapheresis from a donor who had recovered from COVID-19 for more than two weeks and had a SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD-specific IgG titer of >1:640. The patient received convalescent plasma twice from the same donor: 200 ml at 9:45 p.m. on the seventh day of hospitalization and 100 ml at 6:50 p.m. on the eleventh day of hospitalization. After convalescent plasma transfusions, the levels of white blood cells and neutrophils fluctuated but eventually stabilized within the normal range. The absolute lymphocyte counts had a downward trend from the time of admission (from 0.75\u00d710 9 /L to 0.63 \u00d710 9 /L) but increased after the transfusions of convalescent plasma, reaching 1.08\u00d710 9 /L at the time of discharge ( Figure 1C ). C-reactive protein showed a downward trend after convalescent plasma infusion ( Figure 1D ). IL-6 increased to 66.21 pg/ml after the first infusion of convalescent plasma but subsequently declined ( Figure 1E ). Patient's viral load decreased significantly, by a factor of approximately 18 (from 2.55\u00d710 4 to 1.39\u00d710 3 copies/mL), 24 hours after the first transfusion of convalescent plasma. Following the initial convalescent plasma transfusion, the patient also received antiviral treatment with the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f traditional Chinese medicine, but no significant decline in viral load was observed 24 hours after the treatment (from 1.39\u00d710 3 to 1.20\u00d710 3 copies/mL). As a result, a second transfusion of convalescent plasma was given to the patient, and then the viral load became undetectable ( Figure 1B) . The patient had additional viral load testing on days 12 and 13 of hospitalization, with both days producing negative results, and he was discharged on day 13 of hospitalization.",

Moreover, senior patients have a high mortality rate. The patient in our report is an elderly man with multiple comorbidities.

He had respiratory symptoms but no obvious fever, although there was some temperature fluctuation ( Figure 1A) , which may be attributable to his advanced age and decreased immunity.

We did observe significant decreases in viral load after convalescent plasma transfusions, suggesting that convalescent plasma therapy may be a viable option for treating COVID-19. This result is consistent with the findings of other reports [6] [7] [8] . We also observed other changes, such as improved cell counts and decreased level of C-reactive protein, as previously reported [9] .

If, however, COVID-19 convalescent plasma is readily available and can be used to treat COVID-19 effectively and safely, its use should be considered in the management of older patients. In addition, untreated elderly patients with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, such as the patient in our report, may represent a persistent infectious source; therefore, perhaps we should be more vigilant with our treatment decisions for elderly patients if a relatively inexpensive approach such as convalescent plasma is available.
