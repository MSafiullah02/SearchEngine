As part of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of acute expiratory wheezing in children, we performed extensive diagnostic evaluations for respiratory virus infection. The study included 293 children who presented to the Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland), during the period from September 2000 through May 2002 [12, 13]. Acute expiratory wheezing was considered to be bronchiolitis when it occurred for the first time in children aged <3 years. Asthma was diagnosed on the basis of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines [14]. All other episodes of acute expiratory wheezing were considered to be recurrent wheezing.",

Nucleic acids were extracted from 400 \u00b5L of the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples using the MagAttract Virus Mini M48 kit and the Biorobot M48 instrument (Qiagen), and samples were eluted in 100 \u00b5L of RNase-free water. For serum samples, 100 \u00b5L of serum was processed using the QIAamp blood mini kit (Qiagen), and DNA was eluted in 50 \u00b5L. The PCR assay targeted the NP-1 gene of HBoV. The 20-\u00b5L amplification reaction contained 5 \u00b5L of sample DNA, 10 \u00b5L of TaqMan universal PCR master mix (PE Applied Biosystems), 0.1 \u00b5L of bovine serum albumin (20 mg/mL), 300 nmol/L each primer (Boca-forward, GGA AGA GAC ACT GGC AGA CAA; and Boca-reverse, GGG TGT TCC TGA TGA TAT GAG C), and 150 nmol/L Boca probe (FAM-CTG CGG CTC CTG CTC CTG TGA T-TAMRA). Amplification was performed using a LightCycler 1.2 instrument (Roche) with the following instrument settings: 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 0 s, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. For standardizing the quantification, a plasmid (NPSC3.1) containing the HBoV NP-1 gene was used in serial dilutions covering a range of 6 logs. The criteria for a positive reaction were a cycle threshold <40 cycles and fluorescence count >0.5. The minimum genome viral load that would allow reproducible quantification was 10 copies per reaction, corresponding to 500 copies/mL for nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens or 1000 copies/mL for serum specimens. The analyses were performed at a diagnostic laboratory, with rigorous measures to prevent contamination. The real-time PCR assay was compared with the previously published single end-point PCR assay targeting the NP-1 gene [3] by parallel analysis of 74 samples. Fifteen samples yielded positive results with both assays, 5 yielded positive results with real-time PCR only, and the remaining 54 yielded negative results with both assays.",

Virus culture was performed for adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133 (PIV 1\u20133), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses, in accordance with routine diagnostic protocols, in A549, HeLa, and LLC-MK2 and human foreskin fibroblast cells, as well as for human metapneumovirus in tertiary monkey kidney cells [16]. Viral antigens were detected for adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, PIV 1\u20133, and RSV by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay [17]. Levels of IgG antibodies specific for the same viruses (except for PIV 2 and human metapneumovirus) were analyzed in paired serum samples, in addition to IgM antibodies for enteroviruses. RT-PCR was used for the detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, RSV, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, and human metapneumovirus. These results were reported elsewhere [12]. In addition to HBoV diagnostic evaluations, the present study included extended diagnostic evaluations by real-time PCR for influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, PIV 1\u20134, and coronavirus NL63 (in Rotterdam) and coronavirus HKU-1 (in Stockholm). Total nucleic acids for these analyses were isolated using a MagnaPure LC isolation station (Roche). Amplification was performed with an ABI7700 instrument, using commercially available master mixes (Applied Biosystems) and standard protocols. The primer sequences for PIV 1\u20134 and coronavirus HKU-1 are available from the authors. Otherwise, the primer and probe sequences, PCR protocols, and other viral detection methods were described elsewhere [12, 16, 18\u201321]. The sequencing of the 12 previously reported, nontypable rhinoviruses and enteroviruses [12] identified them as rhinoviruses. A patient was considered to be positive for the virus if results of at least 1 of the tests used were positive.",

However, because age distributions and sampling techniques differed between the 2 groups, this comparison should be interpreted with caution. We searched for additional evidence of causality by studying whether detection of HBoV was unrelated or inversely correlated to the occurrence of other viruses in children with acute wheezing [3]. HBoV was indeed more prevalent among children with symptoms of an otherwise unexplained etiology than among those in which other viruses were detected (46% vs. 16%; P < .001) (table 2). Stratification of the patients on the basis of a nasopharynx HBoV load of <104 copies/mL versus >104 copies/mL revealed that only the patients with a high HBoV load had this association (table 2). This suggests that the presence of HBoV at high\u2014but not at low\u2014viral loads is associated with previously unexplained acute wheezing.",

A large number of the samples had low HBoV loads, making evaluation of prevalence highly dependent on assay sensitivity. Differences in PCR assay sensitivity may, of course, similarly have affected the relative prevalence estimates for all 16 of the viruses studied. It should also be recognized that nasopharyngeal sampling is not a standardized procedure.

However, these results are consistent with the recent findings of Kesebir et al. [23], who reported that nasal wash samples obtained from 96 asymptomatic children were negative for HBoV. Nevertheless, the comparison of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals remains problematic. The large number of mixed infections observed with HBoV may indicate that HBoV is reactivated\u2014or its detection enhanced\u2014by other infections. This would result in a higher prevalence among symptomatic patients than among control subjects, even in the absence of an etiologic role. Respiratory secretions recovered during acute infection are also inherently very different from those recovered from asymptomatic subjects (e.g., with regard to cell counts). Therefore, evidence of a virus-disease association must rely also on criteria other than differences in the prevalence between case patients and control subjects.",

Applying this model to the present study would suggest that HBoV is a potential etiologic agent in 28 patients (11%) with a high viral load, of whom 10 (3.9%) had HBoV infection alone. However, some studies have reported that dual viral infections are associated with more-severe disease than are infections with a single agent, so the clinical relevance of HBoV infection with a low viral load will also require additional study [24\u201326].",

It is possible that children with high-titer HBoV in both the respiratory tract and the blood had a primary HBoV infection, and this hypothesis is supported by the finding that serum viral loads generally became low or undetectable after clinical recovery. However, confirmation of a primary infection will have to await the development of an HBoV antibody assay. An HBoV infection with a low viral load may reflect long-term virus persistence after clinical recovery, as has been reported for parvovirus B19 [29, 30]. The findings of HBoV in a few convalescent-phase serum samples and in serum samples obtained from some patients whose respiratory tract specimens tested negative for HBoV are also consistent with virus persistence. Cases of possibly symptomatic primary HBoV infection (in the patients with HBoV infection alone) seemed to be particularly common among children aged \u223c1 year (i.e., soon after the loss of maternal antibodies). Such cases emerged throughout the year (table 4). These findings, together with the high prevalence rate, suggest that HBoV is an endemic virus in the study area.",
