            "text": "The RNA viruses within the order Nidovirales, which possess a linear single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome with a 5\u2032 cap structure and 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, are a genetically diverse group consisting of four families: Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and the recently established Mesoniviridae (Lauber et al., 2012). Nidoviruses consist of approximately 80 virus species with a wide variety of hosts, ranging from crustaceans to mammals (Adams et al., 2016, Cowley and W.P., 2008, De Groot et al., 2012, Siddell et al., 2005). Members of Mesoniviridae have been isolated from various mosquito species in Africa (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, and China), Australia (Northern Territory), and North America (USA) (Hang et al., 2016, Kuwata et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2013, Nga et al., 2011, Thuy et al., 2013, Vasilakis et al., 2014, Warrilow et al., 2014, Zirkel et al., 2011, Zirkel et al., 2013), thus suggesting a wide geographic distribution. To date, however, only one mesonivirus, the Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), has been reported in China (Zhou et al., 2017). Based on phylogenetic and DEmARC (DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering) analyses using either replicase non-structural proteins or large subsets of replicase non-structural polyproteins (3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) to O-methyltransferase (OMT) domains), Mesoniviridae has been divided into the genus Alphamesonivirus and one unassigned genus (Approved Proposal of the Mesoniviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, see Adams et al., 2016) [http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp].",

The virus morphology, growth properties, host range, genome organization, and putative proteins were determined. It is suggested that the virus is a new species (named Yichang virus) of Mesoniviridae. This study will help open new perspectives in and further our understanding of the family Mesoniviridae.",

Detailed analysis and comparisons of genome organization revealed some notable differences, such as the presence of block insertions of up to 390 nt (130 aa) in the 5\u2032 terminal quadrant of ORF1a compared with the CavV, Hana, Houston, Meno, and Casuarina viruses. The block insertion region was flanked by TMD1 and TMD2 and no conserved domains were found. In the same area, the Dak Nong (DKNV, 61 aa), Meno (13 aa), Kamgphang Phet (66 aa), Karang Sari (196 aa), and Bontag Baru viruses (193 aa) exhibit similar features (Vasilakis et al., 2014, Kuwata et al., 2013), but share low amino acid similarities. For example, the common sequence \u201cSKRKGK\u201d has been detected in BTaV, KsaV, and KPhV at both the N- and C-terminuses and in DKNV on the N-terminus, but only partially (\u201cKGK\u201d) found at the N-terminus in the Yichang virus, and not located in the Meno virus at all. The imperfectly repeated sequences (KAEE and RKGN) within each insertion region, which suggest possible origin through recombination or sequence duplication events, were not found in the Yichang virus (Vasilakis et al., 2014). Moreover, this insertion feature is only found in the Asian strains, although its function remains unknown. Previous analysis of the evolution of nidovirus genomes concluded that genome expansion occurred in a wave-like fashion, in which the three major coding regions (OFR1b, ORF1a, and 3\u2032ORFs) expanded consecutively in a hierarchy that reflects the roles of their encoded proteins in the virus replication cycle (Lauber et al., 2013). The newly isolated Yichang virus provides evidence that nidoviruses have an inherent capacity for genome expansion, most likely associated with the transitional retention of sequences that serve as a resource for the evolution of new functions.",

The predicted structure of the Yichang virus featured only three relatively short regions of complementary pseudoknot domains instead of four, as previously reported (Vasilakis et al., 2014); therefore, we speculated that these three regions are important due to their strong conservation. It should be noted that a common \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence (CACUUUU) found in other members of Mesoniviridae was not detected in the Yichang virus, and the Yichang virus sequence could not be read through in this region.
