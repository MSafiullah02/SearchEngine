Viral RNA detection by PCR is described by the WHO as the method of choice for the detection of 2009 H1N1 virus infection (WHO, 2009b) . The use of rRT-PCR testing permits the highest sensitivity for the detection of influenza in respiratory specimens and uniquely allows for the specific identification of the influenza A 2009 H1N1. RIDTs have been widely adopted because they are rapid, convenient, and require less expertise to perform. As a consequence, a great deal of attention has been placed on the accuracy of RIDT for detecting 2009 H1N1. RIDT has been previously demonstrated to have a lower sensitivity than RT-PCR in the detection of seasonal influenza, often ranging from 41% to 87% depending on the prevalence, specimen type, and age of the patient (Liao et al., 2009) . The analytical sensitivities of several RIDT assays have been shown to be comparable between 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza H1N1 (Chan et al., 2009) . The clinical sensitivity for the 2009 H1N1 virus was reported to be 11-70% (Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010) or, compared with only RT-PCR as the reference, in the range of 45-63% when 30 positive specimens were included (Karre et al., 2010; Velasco et al., 2010 ; Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010). Similar to these findings, the Binax NOW FluA/B RIDT in this study had a sensitivity of 42.3% compared to PCR (Table 1) . The low negative predictive value of RIDT for influenza A has serious implications for the continued reliance of RIDT as the firstline diagnostic test for influenza when a laboratory diagnosis is required for patient management. This observation agrees with the consensus that a negative result should not be used to make decisions with respect to treatment or infection prevention (Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 168, "text": "(WHO, 2009a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 293, "end": 305, "text": "(WHO, 2009b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 935, "end": 954, "text": "(Liao et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1107, "text": "(Chan et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1421, "text": "(Karre et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1442, "text": "Velasco et al., 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1659, "end": 1668, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "29.5% (106/367) of the NP swabs sent to our laboratory during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that tested negative for influenza 2009 H1N1 were shown to contain a respiratory virus by xTAG RVP testing. These findings highlight the importance of accurate laboratory testing to support the diagnoses of patients with signs and symptoms of influenza. The xTAG RVP has a valuable capability to detect novel influenza A virus strains and it was utilized during the early months of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic before an H1N1 2009specific PCR could be validated. The CDC H1N1 rRT-PCR protocol for the detection and characterization of the pandemic influenza A 2009 H1N1 is specified to be used with 96-well format real-time-PCR instruments. Performance of this assay when applied on a LightCycler 480 II instrument (CDC H1N1 in-house LC480 rRT-PCR) demonstrated a comparatively low sensitivity (78.2%) but retained a very high PPV which is ideal for confirmation testing (Table 1 ).
