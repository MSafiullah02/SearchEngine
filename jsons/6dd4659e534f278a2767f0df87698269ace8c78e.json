It has been cultivated and naturalised since ancient times throughout the Mediterranean region of Asia, Caucasus, northern Africa and Europe. The fruit has manifold uses as it is today and was featured in Egyptian mythology and art, in the Old Testament of the Bible and in the Babylonian Talmud. From its native range, it was introduced to central and southern India and southeast Asia. It was reported growing in Indonesia in 1416. It was introduced into Latin America and California by the Spanish in 1796, it is now grown in California and Arizona. It has been widely cultivated throughout India and drier parts of southeast Asia and tropical Africa. The most important growing regions are Egypt, China, Afghanistan, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, India, Myanmar and Saudi Arabia. There are some commercial orchards in Israel on the coastal plain and in the Jordan Valley.",

Areas with mean annual temperature of 20-24\u00b0C is ideal. It suffers severe, irrecoverable injuries at temperatures below -11.0\u00b0C. The plant thrives in a semi-arid condition with mean annual rainfall of 500 to 1,000 mm and is extremely drought-tolerant. It does not fl ower and fruit well in very humid and wet climates. It is cultivated up to altitudes of 2,000 m as occur throughout the western range (Baluchistan, N. & S. Waziristan, NWFP, Kurram, Dir, Chitral) in Pakistan. The species is adaptable to a wide range of soil types including soils on which other fruit species will not grow. It thrives on calcareous soil, alkaline soil, gravelly soil and on deep, acidic loams. For commercial cultivation well-drained, heavy, light and medium soils are preferred although it can withstand seasonal waterlogging. Irrigation is required to sustain high yields in drier areas.",

For beverage purposes, the juice is usually sweetened. Pomegranate juice is widely made into grenadine syrup for use in mixed drinks, cocktails and often processed into wine. In Saudi Arabia, the juice sacs may be frozen intact or the extracted juice may be concentrated and frozen, for future use. The juice can be processed into jellies by the addition of pectin and sugar.",

In northern India, the reduced juice is used for desserts and for marinating and tenderising meat due to its proteolytic enzymes. Dried pomegranate arils are used in various cuisines such as trail mix, granola bars, or as toppings for ice-cream, yogurt and salads. Dried whole arils are commonly sold in ethnic Indian subcontinent markets. They impart a subtle, sweet-sour and tart fl avour popular in Punjab and Gujarat. Dried pomegranate seeds, ' anardana ', has culinary importance as spice for vegetable and legume dishes in Northern India and in Pakistani cuisine. These dried seeds are used as an acidic condiment for chutney and curry preparation. The dried seeds can also be ground and used, which results in a deeper fl avoring in dishes and prevents the seeds from getting stuck in teeth. Seeds of the wild pomegranate variety known as daru from the Himalayas are renown as quality sources for this spice. In Turkey, pomegranate seeds are also used in salads and sometimes as garnish for desserts such as g\u00fclla\u00e7 . In Greece and Cyprus, pomegranate is used to make kolliva , a mixture of pomegranate seeds and sugar.",

Pomegranate fruit peel had been reported to be a rich source of hydrolyzable tannins called ellagitannins (ETs); pomegranate ETs were found to show potent antioxidant, antiatherosclerotic and anticancer activities (Seeram et al. 2005b ) . The major fruit peel ETs were punicalagin (80-85% w/w) and ellagic acid (EA; 1.3% w/w) and unquanti fi ed amounts of punicalin and ellagitannin-glycosides (hexoside, rhamnoside and pentoside). Pomegrante fruit peel is currently an underutilized food by-product with potential to develop phytoceuticals with potential health bene fi ts or to develop products for use in the cosmetic and food biopreservative industries (Seeram et al. 2005b ) . Prodelphinidins and gallocatechins including gallocatechin, gallocatechin-(4-8)-catechin, gallocatechin-(4-8)-gallocatechin and catechin-(4-8)-gallocatechin were identi fi ed from pomegranate peels (Plumb et al. 2002 ) . Luteolin, luteolin 7-O -glucoside, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O -glucoside, kaempferol-3-Orhamnoglycoside and quercetin were found in the fruit peel (van Elswijk et al. 2004 ) . Of the ellagi-tannins isolated from pomegranate pericarp, seven namely punicalin, punicalagin, granatin B, gallagyldilactone, casuarinin, pedunculagin and tellimagrandin I were found to be active carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and four namely gallic acid, granatin A, corilagin and ellagic acid to be weakly active inhibitors. The type of inhibition by three and seven punicalagin and gallagyldilactone was found to be noncompetitive. A new antifungal peptide designated as pomegranin with a molecular mass of 11 kDa, was isolated from fresh pomegranate peels (Guo et al. 2009 ) . Epicatechin, epigallocatechin 3-gallate, fl avan-3-ol, catechin were found in the fruit peel and juice (de Pascual-Teresa et al. 2000 ) . Pomegranate fruit and juice were found to contain the following lignans: isolariciresinol, medioresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and syringaresinol (Bonzanini et al. 2009 ). Total lignin contents in the seeds was determined as 36.1 m g/g, in wood knots 17.8 m g/g, in fruit pulp 11.2 m g/g and in the endocarp.3.3 m g/g. Syringaresinol was most abundant in the seed (23.5 m g/g), pinoresinol in knots (8.9 m g/g), pulp (7.4 m g/g) endocarp (3.3 m g/g) and juice (2.1 m g/g). Lignans were also found in two concentrated juices and three pomegranate beverages at levels of 0.4-4.4 m g/g. In addition to the peel, mesocarp, and twigs, lignans were detected in two juices obtained from entire pomegranate fruits, four commercial juices, and three encapsulated pomegranate extracts (Fischer et al. 2012 ) . Isolariciresinol was the predominant lignan with contents of 5.0, 10.5, and 45.8 mg/kg dry matter in processed pomegranate mesocarp, peel, and twigs, respectively.",

The fruit skin contained only the cyanidin and pelargonidin derivatives. Generally, there was an increase in juice pigmentation with fruit ripening. The concentration of pigments in juice obtained from mature pomegranates ranged between 50 and 100 m g of anthocyanin per gram fresh weight of arils. Six anthocyanin pigments delphinidin 3-glucoside and 3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside and 3,5-diglucoside and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3,5-diglucoside were found to be responsible for the red color of pomegranate juice (Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 1999 ) . Generally, juice pigmentation increased as the fruit ripened. In the early fruit-ripening stages, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside was the major pigment, followed by cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside, while in the later stages, the monoglucoside derivatives cyanidin 3-glucoside and delphinidin 3-glucoside increased considerably. The pelargonidin derivatives were always present in small amounts. RP-HPLC analysis of pomegranate arils' anthocyanins revealed mono-and diglucosylated delphinidins and cyanidins as the major anthocyanins and pelargonidins as minor components (Borochov-Neori et al. 2011 ) . Anthocyanin accumulation changed inversely to the season's temperatures. Cyanidins were generally more abundant but delphinidin accumulation was enhanced in cooler season. Monoglucosylated anthocyanins prevailed at cooler temperatures and subsided during seasonal warming with a concomitant rise in diglucoside proportion.",

Qualitatively, the pomegranate fatty acid composition of 21 pomegranate cultivars (15 Tunisian and 6 Chinese) seed oil was identical comprising mainly unsaturated about 88% (Elfalleh et al. 2011b ). The predominant fatty acid was linolenic acid (44.51-86.14%), followed by linoleic acid (3.57-13.92%), oleic acid (3.03-12.88%), palmitic acid (3.13-11.82%), stearic acid (1.68-15.64%), gadoleic acid (0.50-4.91%), lignoceric acid ( < 2.53%), arachidic acid ( < 1.70%) and myristic acid ( < 0.85%). ) isolated the following bioactive compounds from pomegranate seeds: coniferyl",

Various parts of the plant viz. seed, aril, fruit juice, peel, leaf, fl ower, bark, and roots have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals with interesting medicinal values and pharmacological activities. The phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of pomegranate plant parts suggest a wide range of clinical applications for the treatment and prevention of ailments such as cancer as well as other diseases where chronic in fl ammation is believed to play an essential etiologic role . The synergistic action of the pomegranate constituents appears to be superior to that of single constituents. In the past two decade, numerous invitro, in-vivo and preclinical studies on the antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and anti-in fl ammatory properties of pomegranate constituents have been published, focusing on treatment and prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dental conditions, erectile dysfunction, bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance, and ultraviolet radiation-induced skin damage (Jurenka 2008 ) . Other potential applications include infant brain ischemia, male infertility, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, and obesity.",

Pomegranate juice, peel, and seed oil antioxidants were con fi rmed by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) methods (Elfalleh et al. 2011 ) . The highest values were recorded in peels with 25.63 mmol trolox equivalent/100 g and 22.08 mmol TE/100 g for FRAP and ORAC assay, respectively. The tocopherol ( a -tocopherol, g -tocopherol, and d -tocopherol) contents were, respectively, 165.77, 107.38, and 27.29 mg/100 g from dry pomegranate seed. Four phenolic compounds were identi fi ed and quanti fi ed in pomegranate peel and pulp: 2 hydroxybenzoic acids (gallic and ellagic acids) and 2 hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic and p -coumaric acids). Results showed that the antioxidant potency of pomegranate extracts was correlated with their phenolic compound content. In particular, the highest correlation was reported in peels. High correlations were also found between peel hydroxybenzoic acids and FRAP ORAC antioxidant capacities. Identi fi ed tocopherols appeared to contribute in major part to the antioxidant activity of pomegranate seed oil. Gil et al. ( 2000 ) found that the antioxidant activity of commercial pomegranate juices (18\u221220 TEAC) was three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6\u22128 TEAC). Commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates showed higher antioxidant activity than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12\u221214 TEAC). Further, they found that commercial juices contained the pomegranate abundant tannin punicalagin (1,500\u22121,900 mg/L) while only traces were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils showing that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. Also, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable tannins were found in the pomegranate juices. The results of studies by Tzulker et al. ( 2007 ) showed that the antioxidant activity in pomegranate aril juice correlated signi fi cantly to the total polyphenol and anthocyanin contents. However, the homogenates prepared from the whole fruit exhibited an approximately 20-fold higher antioxidant activity than the level found in the aril juice. Unlike the arils, the antioxidant level in the homogenates correlated signi fi cantly to the content of the four hydrolyzable tannins in which punicalagin was predominant, while no correlation was found to the level of anthocyanins.",

It was much more potent than Concord grape juice, blueberry juice, red wine, ascorbic acid, and DL-\u03b1-tocopherol. As little as three \u03bcl of a six-fold dilution of pomegranate juice, in a reaction volume of 5,000 \u03bc l, produced a marked antioxidant effect, whereas 300 \u03bc l of undiluted blueberry juice or nearly 1,000 \u03bc l of undiluted Concord grape juice were required to produce similar effects. pomegranate juice and other antioxidant-containing products were found to augment the anti-proliferative action of nitric oxide (DETA/NO) on vascular smooth muscle cell (rat aorta) proliferation. and other antioxidant-containing products were found to augment the antiproliferative action of NO on vascular smooth muscle cell (rat aorta) proliferation. Pomegranate juice was much more effective than the other products tested and elicited no effects when tested alone in the absence of added NO. Pomegranate juice elicited no effects on eNOS protein expression or catalytic activity and did not enhance promoter activity in the eNOS gene. The observations indicated that pomegranate juice possessed potent antioxidant activity that resulted in marked protection of nitric oxide against oxidative destruction Pande and Akoh ( 2009 ) in their study found the highest antioxidant capacity to be in pomegranate leaves followed by peel, pulp, and seed. The tannin rich mixtures from pomegranate by-product exhibited IC 50 values against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation at 0.8-19 m g/ mL. The antioxidant capacity (ORAC) of pomegranate juice was 2,860 m mol TE/100 g pomegranate juice which was comparable to blueberry and grape juice (Thomas and Gebhardt 2008 ) . Oral administration of fl avonoid rich fractions from pomegranate fruits to rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day exhibited potential antiperoxidative activity (Sudeesh and Vijayalakshmi 2005 ) . Malondialdehyde, hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes levels in the liver were signi fi cantly decreased antioxidative enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were signi fi cantly elevated. Glutathione content in the tissues were also increased. Pomegranate fermented juice and cold pressed seed oil exhibited potent antioxidant activity almost equivalent to butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and green tea ( Thea sinensis ), but signi fi cantly higher than that of red wine ( Vitis vitifera ) (Schubert et al. 1999 ) . Flavonoids extracted from cold pressed pomegranate seed oil exhibited 31-44% inhibition of sheep cyclooxygenase and 69-81% inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase. Flavonoids extracted from pomegranate fermented juice displayed 21-30% inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase but showed no signi fi cant inhibition of sheep cyclooxygenase. Total polyphenols in cold pressed pomegranate seed oil showed a concentration by weight of approximately 0.015%. Fatty acid composition in cold pressed pomegranate seed oil showed punicic acid (65.3%) along with palmitic acid (4.8%), stearic acid (2.3%), oleic acid (6.3%), linoleic acid (6.6%) and three unidenti fi ed peaks from which two (14.2%) are probably isomers of punicic acid.",

The anthocyanidins inhibited a Fenton reagent \u00b7OH generating system. Further, the anthocyanidins inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenates with ID 50 values 0.7, 3.5, and 85 m M, respectively for delphinidin, cyanidin, and pelargonidin (Noda et al. 2002 ) .

The good antioxidant action of punicalagin a high molecular weight polyphenol isolated from pomegranate fruit pith and carpellary membrane was expressed not only through its scavenging reactions but also by its ability to form metal chelates (Kulkarni et al. 2007 ) . Binding of punicalagin with bovine serum albumin and metal ions such as iron and copper revealed different binding af fi nities, whereas its binding with DNA was very weak and non-speci fi c. In-vitro cytotoxic studies against three cell lines, namely, Vero (normal African green monkey kidney cell line), Hep-2 (human larynx epithelial cancer cell line), and A-549 (human small cell lung carcinoma cell line) showed that punicalagin, was toxic only at higher concentration.",

            "text": "Studies found that pomegranate peel had the highest antioxidant activity among the peel, pulp and seed fractions of 28 kinds of fruits commonly consumed in China as determined by FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assay (Guo et al. 2003 ) . In a subsequent study pomegranate peel extract was shown to have markedly higher antioxidant capacity than the pulp extract in scavenging or preventive capacity against superoxide anion, hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals as well as inhibiting CuSO4-induced LDL oxidation. The contents of total phenolics, fl avonoids and proathocyanidins were also higher in peel extract than in pulp extract. The large amount of phenolics contained in peel extract may cause its strong antioxidant ability. The authors concluded that pomegranate peel extract appeared to have more potential as a health supplement rich in natural antioxidants than the pulp extract. Separate studies showed pomegranate peel extracts to have both antioxidant and antimutagenic properties and may be exploited as biopreservatives in food applications and neutraceuticals (Negi et al. 2003 ) . All the pomegranate peel extracts (ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol and water) exhibited marked antioxidant capacity, but the water extract was the lowest. The order of antioxidant capacity varied because of differential responses at four concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100 m g/mL) in each solvent (Negi et al. 2003 ) . Studies in male rats showed that pomegranate fruit peel extract decreased lipid peroxidation in hepatic, cardiac, and renal tissues and serum glucose concentration (Parmar and Kar 2008 ) . Pomegranate peels were found to contain potent antioxidant contents, as evidenced by free radical DPPH scavenging value of 3.58 m g/mL and ABTS scavenging value of 7.364 mM Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity/100 g dry weight (Elfalleh et al. 2009 ) . Aqueous and alcoholic extracts of pomegranate rind showed good antioxidant effect with IC 50 ranging from 34.78 to 135.27/mL for aqueous and 40.03-105.93 m g/mL for alcoholic extracts (Rajan et al. 2011 ) . Phenolic compounds, tannins and fl avonoids were the major phytochemicals present in both the extracts. The aqueous and alcoholic extract yielded 122.33 and 176 mg/g gallic acid equivalent phenolic content, 135.33snf 81.33 mg/g quercetin equivalent fl avonoid and 81.66 and 114.23 mg/g tannic acid equivalent tannins respectively. Plumb et al. ( 2002 ) found that the prodelphinidin dimers from pomegranate peels were potent antioxidants in the aqueous phase, being much more effective than the gallocatechin monomer in scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate, ABTS) relative to the water-soluble vitamin E analogue Trolox C (expressed as Trolox C equivalent antioxidant capacity, TEAC). In the lipid phase, only one of the dimers (gallocatechin-(4-8)-catechin) was signi fi cantly more effective than the monomer in the inhibition of lipid peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine vesicles. The water, methanol, acetone and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts of pomegranate peel phenolics showed enhanced inhibitory effect on lard peroxidation as the phenolic concentrations increased . Acetone extract exhibited the highest antiliperoxidant activity followed by water, methanol and EtOAc extracts. Acetone extract at 0.1% (w/w) and water extract at 0.2% (w/w) exhibited an antiliperoxidant effect close to that of tea polyphenols (0.02%, w/w) and higher than that of BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) (0.02%, w/w). At 0.2% (w/w), acetone extract exerted a higher inhibitory activity on lard oxidation than that of tea polyphenols and BHT. Studies by Guo et al. ( 2007 ) showed that showed that red pomegranate peel extract had the best effect on the scavenging ability of superoxide anion with lowest IC 50 value (4.01 m g/mL) among all pomegranate extracts (peel, juice, and seed of three varieties). The peel extract of white pomegranate had the best scavenging ability on hydrogen peroxide with the lowest IC 50 value (0.032 m g/mL) of the nine extracts. The seed extract of white pomegranate could scavenge hydroxide radical most effectively of the nine extracts (the IC 50 value 1.69 m g/ mL). The seed extract of white pomegranate (the IC 50 value was 3.67 m g/mL) was the most powerful on the DNA damage-preventing effect of the extracts. The results of studies by Xu et al. ( 2008 ) indicated that pomegranate peel extracts exerted protective effects on oxidative stress in mice loaded with restraint stress which may be attributed to its free radical scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect. The extract decreased alanine aminotransferase and malondialdehyde levels and increased antioxidant capacity in the liver and glutathione levels in plasma as compared with restraint stress control mice. The methanol fraction of pomegranate peel showed highest antioxidant activity by all the four in vitro assays viz. DPPH free radical scavenging, phosphomolybdenum, FRAP (Fe(3+) reducing power) and CUPRAC (cupric ions (Cu(2+)) reducing ability) comparable to ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) followed by activity in ethanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate fractions (Zahin et al. 2010a ) .",

However, only the rind extract was capable of preventing the deleterious effects -cytotoxicity, DNA damage and depletion of non-protein sulphydrils (NPSH) pool, caused by treatment of cells with hydroxide peroxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide or oxidized lipoproteins (Ox-LDL) via a mechanism which was postulated to involve both direct scavenging of radical species and iron chelation. The results suggested that the aril juice the major and tasty part of pomegranate fruit, did not contain ellagic acid and punicalagin (i.e. the polyphenols highly represented in the rind which appeared to be responsible for the antioxidant capacity) in amounts suf fi cient to exert cytoprotection in oxidatively injured, living cells. Based on these results, the authors advocated that development and evaluation of rinds-only based derivatives of pomegranate for antiatherogenic preventive purposes in humans should be encouraged.",

Studies showed pomegranate fruit possessed chemopreventive and adjuvant therapeutic potential for human breast cancer (Kim et al. 2002 ) . Polyphenols from fermented pomegranate juice, pericarp, and oil inhibited aromatase activity by 60-80% indicating its ability to effect a blockade of endogenous active estrogen biosynthesis. Fermented juice and pericarp polyphenols, and whole seed oil, inhibited 17-b -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 from 34 to 79%, at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1,000 m g/mL in the sequence seed oil > > fermented juice polyphenols > pericarp polyphenols. Lyophilized fresh pomegranate juice elicited a 55% inhibition of the estrogenic activity of 17-b -estradiol; whereas the lyophilized juice by itself displayed only minimal estrogenic action. Inhibition of cell lines by fermented juice and pericarp polyphenols was according to estrogen-dependent (MCF-7) > > estrogen-independent (MB-MDA-231) > normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). In both MCF-7 and MB-MDA-231 cells, fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols consistently displayed about twice the anti-proliferative effect as fresh pomegranate juice polyphenols. Pomegranate seed oil elicited 90% inhibition of proliferation of MCF-7 at 100 m g/mL medium, 75% inhibition of invasion of MCF-7 across a Matrigel membrane at 10 m g/mL, and 54% apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 estrogen receptor negative metastatic human breast cancer cells at 50 m g/mL. In a murine mammary gland organ culture, fermented juice polyphenols effected 47% inhibition of cancerous lesion formation induced by the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (DMBA). Pomegranate seed oil and fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols were found to have anti-angiogenic activity (Toi et al. 2003 ) . In-vitro studies showed that these pomegranate fractions strongly suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor in normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) and in estrogen sensitive (MCF-7) human breast cancer cells, but upregulated migration inhibitory factor in estrogen resistant (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells. An anti-proliferative effect on angiogenic cells was shown in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and in myometrial and amniotic fl uid fi broblasts, and inhibition of HUVEC tubule formation was also demonstrated in an invitro model employing glass carrier beads. Additionally, they showed a signi fi cant reduction in new blood vessel formation using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model in-vivo. In another study, pretreatment of mouse mammary organ culture with pomegranate fermented juice polyphenols (W), a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) peak separated from W (peak B), or pomegranate seed oil prior to exposure to the to the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (DMBA) resulted in a 42% reduction in the number of lesions for W compared with control, peak B and pomegranate seed oil each effected an 87% reduction (Mehta and Lansky 2004 ) . Both pomegranate extracts and genistein inhibit the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis, with combination treatment being more ef fi cacious than single treatments (Jeune et al. 2005 ) . More recent studies demonstrated that pomegranate fruit extract dose-dependently inhibited NF-kB-dependent reporter gene expression associated with proliferation, invasion, and motility in aggressive breast cancer phenotypes while suppressing RhoC and RhoA protein expression ) . The bioactive components of the fruit extract comprised mainly ellagitannins and phenolic acids in the aqueous fruit extract and conjugated octadecatrienoic acids in the lipid fruit extract derived from seeds. The results suggested a role of pomegranate fruit extract in lowering the metastatic potential of aggressive breast cancer species. Pomegranate extract inhibited the proliferation and viability of MMTV-Wnt-1 mouse mammary cancer stem cells in-vitro in a timeand concentration-dependent manner (Dai et al. 2010 ) . Its constituents ellagic ursolic acid and luteolin also caused a time-and concentrationdependent reduction of cell proliferation and viability, suggesting that they contribute to the inhibitory effect of the extract, while caffeic acid had no effect. The methanolic pomegranate fruit peel extract was found to reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis on MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Dikmen et al. 2011 ) . In addition, expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax was increased, and that of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 was decreased after pomegranate extract treatment. The extract exhibited high antioxidant activity and yielded total phenolic content of 331.28 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g of extract with ellagic acid as the most abundant constituent.",

UB signi fi cantly inhibited testosterone-induced MCF-7aro cell proliferation. The remaining test compounds also exhibited antiproliferative activity, but to a lesser degree than UB. The results suggested pomegranate ET-derived compounds to have potential for the prevention of estrogen-responsive breast cancers. Pomegranate seed linolenic acid isomers, punicic acid and \u03b1-eleostearic acid were found to be selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) in-vitro (Tran et al. 2010 ) . Punicic acid inhibited (IC 50 ) estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 at 7.2 m M, estrogen receptor \u03b2 at 8.8 m M. \u03b1-eleostearic acid (AEA) inhibited ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 at 6.5/7.8 m M. Punicic acid agonized ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 (EC 50 ) at 1.8/2 m M, antagonizing at 101/80 m M. \u03b1-eleostearic acid antagonized ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 at 150/140 m M. Both isomers induced ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 mRNA expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Punicic acid, an omega-5 fatty acid in pomegranate seed oil, was found capable of inhibiting breast cancer proliferation (Grossmann et al. 2010 ) . Proliferation was inhibited 92 and 96% for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-ER\u03b17 cells, respectively. Further punicic acid induced apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-ER\u03b17 cells by 86 and 91%, respectively compared to untreated control cells and disrupted cellular mitochondrial membrane potential. The results suggested the breast cancer inhibitor properties of punicic acid were dependent on lipid peroxidation and the protein kinase C signalling pathway.",

They found that various fruit extracts had proportional inhibitory effects on human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell proliferation. Fermented pomegranate juice and aqueous extract of pomegranate pericarps were found to be strong promoters of differentiation in all settings, while fresh juice extract showed only a relatively mild differentiation-promoting effect.

All compounds signi fi cantly inhibited invasion when employed individually. When C, P, and L were equally combined at the same gross dosage (4 m g/mL) as when the compounds were tested individually, a supra-additive inhibition of invasion was observed. Pomegranate cold-pressed seed oil, fermented juice polyphenols (W), and pericarp polyphenols (P) each acutely inhibited in-vitro proliferation of human prostate cancer, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU 145 human cancer cell lines (Albrecht et al. 2004 ) . These effects were mediated by changes in both cell cycle distribution and induction of apoptosis. For example, the androgen-independent cell line DU 145 showed a signi fi cant increase from 11 to 22% in G(2)/M cells by treatment with pomegranate oil (35 m g/ mL) with a modest induction of apoptosis. In other cell lines/treatments, the apoptotic response predominated, for example, in PC-3 cells treated with pomegranate pericarp polyphenols, at least partially through a caspase 3-mediated pathway. All agents potently suppressed PC-3 invasion through Matrigel, and furthermore pomegranate pericarp polyphenols and seed oil demonstrated potent inhibition of PC-3 xenograft growth in athymic mice. Overall, the study demonstrated signi fi cant antitumour activity of pomegranatederived materials against human prostate cancer. In another study, combinations of the anatomically discrete pomegranate fractions: fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols (W), pomegranate pericarp (peel) polyphenols (P) or pomegranate seed oil (Oil) exhibited synergistic prostate cancer suppression (Lansky et al. 2005b ) . Supraadditive, complementary and synergistic effects were proven in all models. Proliferation effects were additionally evaluated with CompuSyn software median effect analysis and showed a concentration index CI < 1, con fi rming synergy.",

PFE (10-100 m g/ mL; 48 h) treatment of highly aggressive human prostate cancer PC3 cells resulted in a dosedependent inhibition of cell growth/cell viability and induction of apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis revealed that PFE treatment of PC3 cells resulted in (i) induction of Bax and Bak (proapoptotic); (ii) down-regulation of Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic); (iii) induction of WAF1/p21 and KIP1/p27; (iv) a decrease in cyclins D1, D2, and E; and (v) a decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2, cdk4, and cdk6 expression. Findings established the involvement of the cyclin kinase inhibitor-cyclin-cdk network during the antiproliferative effects of PFE. Oral administration of PFE (0.1 and 0.2%, wt/vol) to athymic nude mice implanted with androgen-sensitive CWR22Rnu1 cells resulted in a signi fi cant inhibition in tumour growth concomitant with a signi fi cant decrease in serum prostate-speci fi c antigen levels. The results suggested that pomegranate juice may have cancer-chemopreventive as well as cancerchemotherapeutic effects against prostate cancer in humans. In a phase II, Simon two-stage clinical trial for men with a rising prostate-speci fi c antigen (PSA), daily consumption of pomegranate juice was found to have a positive effect following surgery or radiation for prostate cancer (Pantuck et al. 2006 ) . There were no serious adverse events reported and the treatment was well tolerated. Mean PSA doubling time signi fi cantly increased with treatment from a mean of 15 months at baseline to 54 months posttreatment. In-vitro assays comparing pretreatment and posttreatment patient serum on the growth of human prostate cancer LNCaP showed a 12% decrease in cell proliferation and a 17% increase in apoptosis, a 23% increase in serum nitric oxide, and signi fi cant reductions in oxidative state and sensitivity to oxidation of serum lipids after versus before pomegranate juice consumption. In further studies, a standardized ellagitannins (ETs)-enriched pomegranate extract (PE), signi fi cantly inhibited LAPC-4 xenograft growth in severe combined immunode fi cient (SCID) mice as compared to vehicle control Seeram et al. 2007 ) . Ellagic acid and several synthesized urolithins were shown to inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer CaP cells in-vitro.

            "text": "The results of studies demonstrated that an ellagitannin-rich pomegranate extract could inhibit tumour-associated angiogenesis as one of several potential mechanisms for slowing the growth of prostate cancer in chemopreventive applications (Sartippour et al. 2008 ) . A pomegranate extract standardized to ellagitannin content (POMx) inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP and HUVEC cells signi fi cantly under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. HIF-1\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) protein levels were also reduced by POMx under hypoxic conditions. POMx decreased prostate cancer xenograft size, tumour vessel density, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) peptide levels and HIF-1\u03b1 expression after 4 weeks of treatment in severe combined immunode fi cient (SCID) mice. Studies showed that pomegranate extract inhibited androgen-independent prostate cancer growth through a nuclear factor-kappaBdependent mechanism . Pomegranate extract (PE) inhibited NF-kappaB and cell viability of prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro. Maximal PE-induced apoptosis was dependent on PE-mediated NF-kappaB blockade. In the LAPC4 xenograft model, PE delayed the emergence of LAPC4 androgen-independent xenografts in castrated mice through an inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The scientist also showed that Pomegranate polyphenols inhibited gene expression and androgen receptor (AR) most consistently in the human prostate cancer LNCaP-AR cell line (Hong et al. 2008 ) . Therefore, inhibition by pomegranate polyphenols of gene expression involved in androgen-synthesizing enzymes and the AR may be of particular importance in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and the subset of human prostate cancers where AR is up-regulated. Koyama et al. ( 2010 ) demonstrated that pomegranate extract derived from rind and arils (minus seeds) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human LAPC4 prostate cancer cells by modulation of the IGF-IGFBP (insulin growth factor -insulin growth factor binding proteins) axis. Pomegranate extract treatment also decreased IGF-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner indicating that its actions also involved tumour-speci fi c suppression of IGF-1.",

It decreased the levels of malondialdehyde of prostate and the activity of acid phosphatase and the number of white blood cell and adjusted the levels of NO in plasma compared with the prostatitis model group. The results indicated that pomegranate peel extracts could markedly improve the protective function of oxidation resistance. Pomegranate ellagitannins/microbial metabolites were found to have CYP1B1 (a target in prostate cancer chemoprevention) inhibitory activity in prostate cancer cells (Kasimsetty et al. 2009 ) . Urolithin A, a microbial metabolite, was the most potent uncompetitive inhibitor of CYP1B1-mediated ethoxyresoru fi n-O -deethylase (EROD) activity, exhibiting two-fold selectivity over CYP1A1, while urolithin B was a noncompetitive inhibitor with three-fold selectivity. The punicalins and punicalagins exhibited potent CYP1A1 inhibition with 5-10-fold selectivity over CYP1B1. Cellular uptake experiments demonstrated a fi ve-fold increase in urolithin uptake by 22Rv1 cells. Western blots of the CYP1B1 protein indicated that the urolithins interfered with the expression of CYP1B1 protein. Thus, urolithins were found to display a dual mode mechanism by decreasing CYP1B1 activity and expression. Wang et al. ( 2011 ) showed that in addition to causing cell death of hormonerefractory prostate cancer cells, pomegranate juice also increased cell adhesion and decreased cell migration of the unkilled cells. Pomegranate juice was found to upregulate genes involved in cell adhesion such as E-cadherin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and down-regulated genes involved in cell migration such as hyaluranan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) and type I collagen. In addition, pomegranate juice signi fi cantly decreased the level of secreted pro-in fl ammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-1 b and RANTES, thereby having the potential to decrease in fl ammation and its impact. Pomegrante juice also inhibited the ability of the chemokine SDF1 a to chemoattract these cancer cells. Faria et al. ( 2007 ) found that pomegranate juice consumption decreased total hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) content as well as the expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A in male mice. Prevention of procarcinogen activation through CYP activity/expression inhibition may be involved in pomegranate juice's effect on tumour initiation, promotion, and progression",

At 100 m g/mL, pomegranate juice, ellagic acid, punicalagin and a standardized total pomegranate tannin (TPT) extract induced apoptosis in HT-29 colon cells. However, in the HCT116 colon cells, ellagic acid, punicalagin and TPT but not pomegranate juice induced apoptosis. The trend in antioxidant activity was pomegranate juice > TPT > punicalagin > ellagic acid. Their data indicated the superior bioactivity of pomegranate juice compared to its puri fi ed individual polyphenolic active ingredients illustrating the multifactorial effects and chemical synergy of the action of multiple compounds. In further studies, they (Adams et al. 2006 ) found that pomegranate juice signi fi cantly suppressed TNF-\u03b1-induced COX-2 protein expression by 79%, total pomegranate tannin extract (TPT) 55%, and punicalagin 48% in HT-29 colcon cells. In addition, pomegranate juice reduced phosphorylation of the p65 subunit and binding to the NFkappaB response element 6.4-fold, TPT suppressed NFkappaB binding ten-fold, punicalagin 3.6fold, whereas ellagic acid was ineffective. Pomegranate juice also abolished TNF\u03b1induced AKT activation, needed for NFkappaB activity. Pomegranate fruit rich in ellagitannins may have bene fi cial effects against colon cancer. In the stomach and gut, ellagitannins were reported to be hydrolyzed to release ellagic acid (EA) and were converted by gut microbiota to urolithin A (3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzopyran-6one) type metabolites (Sharma et al. 2010 ) . They reported that pomegranate ellagitannin extract, ellagic acid, and their colonic metabolite, urolithin A inhibited Wnt signaling, which plays a pivotal role in human colon carcinogenesis, suggesting that ET-rich foods may have potential against colon carcinogenesis and that urolithins were relevant bioactive constituents in the colon. Studies by Gonz\u00e1lez-Sarr\u00edas et al. ( 2009 ) showed that elagic acid and its colonic metabolites, urolithin-A (3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo [b,d] pyran-6-one) and urolithin-B (3-hydroxy-6Hdibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one), modulated phase I and phase II detoxifying enzymes in colon cancer Caco-2 cells. Ellagic acid and urolithins may exert some blocking chemopreventive effects in the colon but this effect may be critically affected by interfering factors, such as the food matrix nature. Saruwatari et al. ( 2008 ) found that pomegranate juice potently inhibited the sulfoconjugation of 1-naphthol in Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells. The inhibition was both doseand culture time-dependent, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 2.7% (vol/vol). Punicalagin, the most abundant antioxidant polyphenol in pomegranate juice, was also found to strongly inhibit sulfoconjugation in Caco-2 cells with an IC 50 of 45 m M. additionally pomegranate juice and punicalagin both inhibited phenol sulfotransferase activity in Caco-2 cells. The data also suggested that constituents of pomegranate juice, most probably punicalagin, impaired the enteric functions of sulfoconjugation and that this may have effects upon the bioavailability of drugs and other compounds and may be related to the anticarcinogenic properties of pomegranate juice. Pomegranate seed oil (PGO) rich in 70% cis (c)9, trans (t)11,c13-18:3 as conjugated linolenic acids (CLA) could suppress by azoxymethane -induced colon carcinogenesis, and the inhibition was associated in part with the increased content of CLA in the colon and liver and/or increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 protein in the colon mucosa (Kohno et al. 2004 ) . Pomegranate extract was found to induce cell cycle arrest and alter cellular phenotype of human pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 and AsPC-1 (Nair et al. 2011 ) Studies by Weisburg et al. ( 2010 ) showed that pomegranate extract exerted greater antiproliferative effects towards cancer (such as HSC-2 carcinoma), than to normal, cells, isolated from the human oral cavity. The antiproliferative mechanism of pomegranate extract was, in part, by induction of oxidative stress. The mode of cell death was by apoptosis, as activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. Reduction of caspase-3 activation and of PARP cleavage in cells co-treated with pomegranate extract and either cobalt or pyruvate, respectively, as compared to pomegranate extract alone, indicated that apoptosis was through the prooxidant nature of pomegranate extract.",

Pretreatment of PFE on TPA-induced skin tumour promotion in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-initiated CD-1 mouse substantially reduced tumour incidence and lower tumour body burden when assessed as total number of tumours per group, percent of mice with tumours and number of tumours per animal as compared to animals that did not receive PFE. Skin application of PFE prior to TPA application also resulted in a signi fi cant delay in latency period from 9 to 14 weeks and afforded protection when tumour data were considered in terms of tumour incidence and tumour multiplicity. Studies by George et al. ( 2011 ) suggested that pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) and diallyl sul fi de (DAS) in combination afforded better suppressive activity of mouse skin tumours than either of these agents alone. PFE and DAS alone delayed onset and tumour incidence by ~ 55 and ~ 45%, respectively, while their combination at low doses synergistically decreased tumour incidence more potentially (~84%,). Further, regression in tumour volume was seen with continuous combinatorial treatment. The inhibition was associated with decreased expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK1 and activated NF-k B/p65, IKK a , I k B a phosphorylation and degradation in skin tissue/ tumour. Polysaccharide (PSP001) isolated from pomegranate rind was found to have antioxidant, antitumour and immunomodulatory properties (Joseph et al. 2012 ) . PSP001 exhibited a dosedependent enhancement in antioxidant activity using concentrations from 10 to 1,000 m g/mL when evaluated using various assays such as, ferric reducing antioxidant power assay, linoleic acid emulsion thiocyanate assay, and superoxide, hydroxyl and nitric oxide radical scavenging assays except for the DPPH assay for which the highest activity was obtained at 200 m g/mL. PSP001 exhibited anticancer activity with IC 50 values of 97.21 and 52.8 m g/-mL following 72 h incubation for MCF-7 (breast cancer), and K562(leukemia) cells, respectively.",

The tannin not only inhibited HSV-2 replication, but also showed stronger effects of killing virus and blocking its absorption to cells. Punica granatum extract showed anti-human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) activity, which was possibly contributed by the polyphenolic compounds in the herbal extract (Li et al. 2004 ) . Studies by Neurath et al. ( 2005 ) indicated that HIV-1 entry inhibitors from pomegranate juice adsorbed onto corn starch and the resulting complex blocked virus binding to CD4 and CXCR4/CCR5 and inhibited infection by primary virus clades A to G and group O. Their results suggested the possibility of producing an anti-HIV-1 microbicide from inexpensive, widely available sources. Pomegranate juice containing polyphenols, \u03b2-sitosterol, sugars and ellagic acid) was reported to inactivate HIV and further shown to inactivate in fl uenza, herpes viruses and poxviruses (Kotwal 2008 ) . A formulation consisting of fulvic acid, a complex mixture of compounds was previously reported to render vaccinia virus, HIV and SARS virus non-infectious. Recently, both fulvic acid and pomegranate juice were shown to inactivate genetically diverse strains of in fl uenza including H5N1, further con fi rming the broad spectrum nature of these agents. Sundararajan et al. ( 2010 ) found that the acidity of pomegranate juice and concentrated liquid extract contributed to rapid anti-in fl uenza activity, but this was not a factor with pomegranate polyphenols powder (93%) extract. Studies using pomegranate powder extract showed that 5 min treatment at room temperature with 800 m g/mL pomegranate polyphenols resulted in at least a 3log reduction in the titers of in fl uenza viruses PR8 (H1N1), X31 (H3N2), and a reassortant H5N1 virus derived from a human isolate. However, the antiviral activity was less against a coronavirus and reassortant H5N1 in fl uenza viruses derived from avian isolates. Electron microscopic analysis indicated that viral inactivation by pomegranate polyphenols was primarily a consequence of virion structural damage.",

Based on the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value, the reducing power of the probioticated pomegranate juices was also much stronger than the nonprobioticated juices. The FRAP values for sweet and sour probioticated pomegranate juices were 97.34 and 120.7 mmol/L, respectively, which were notably higher than 85.87 and 93.4 mmol/L for sweet and sour nonprobioticated juices. Total counts of Lactobacillus casei GG increased by about three log in sweet and two log in sour juices after 48 h incubation. Both fermentated and nonfermentated juices exhibited a potent and widespectrum antibacterial effect, with the highest activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the sweet juice showing wider zones of growth inhibition. The results showed that probiotication of sweet and sour pomegranate juices could add to their bene fi cial antioxidant activities. Pomegranate byproducts and punicalagins inhibited the growth of pathogenic clostridia and Staphylococcus aureus (Bialonska et al. 2009b ) . The growth of probiotic lactobacilli and bi fi dobacteria were generally not affected by ellagitannins. The effect of pomegranate ellagitannins on bi fi dobacteria was species-and tannin-dependent. The growth of Bi fi dobacterium animalis ssp. lactis was slightly inhibited by punicalagins, punicalins, and ellagic acid. Pomegranate ellagitannin-enriched polyphenol extract (POMx) supplementation signi fi cantly enhanced the growth of Bi fi dobacterium breve and Bi fi dobacterium infantis. Bialonska et al. ( 2009a ) found that products of the intestinal microbial transformation of pomegranate ellagitannins may account for systemic antioxidant effects. While moving through the intestines, pomegranate ellagitannins namely ellagic acid and punicalagins are metabolized by gut bacteria into urolithins that readily enter systemic circulation. Their study found that the antioxidant activity of urolithins was correlated with the number of hydroxy groups as well as the lipophilicity of the molecule. The most potent antioxidants were urolithins C and D with IC 50 values of 0.16 and 0.33 m M, respectively, when compared to IC 50 values of 1.1 and 1.4 m M of the parent ellagic acid and punicalagins, respectively. The dihydroxylated urolithin A showed weaker antioxidant activity, with an IC 50 value 13.6 m M, however, the potency was within the range of urolithin A plasma concentrations.",

In healthy humans, pomegranate juice consumption decreased LDL susceptibility to aggregation and retention and increased the activity of serum paraoxonase by 20% (Aviram et al. 2000 ) . Paraoxanase an HDLassociated esterase, could protect against lipid peroxidation. In apolipoprotein E-de fi cient E o mice, oxidation of LDL by peritoneal macrophages was reduced by up to 90% after pomegranate juice consumption and this effect was associated with reduced cellular lipid peroxidation and superoxide release. The uptake of oxidized LDL and native LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages obtained after pomegranate juice administration was reduced by 20%. Further, pomegranate juice supplementation of E o mice reduced the size of their atherosclerotic lesions by 44% and also the number of foam cells compared with control E o mice supplemented with water. The potent antiatherogenic effects in healthy humans and in atherosclerotic mice may be attributable to its antioxidative properties. Anti-atherosclerotic properties was attributed to pomegranate potent anti-oxidative characteristics. After consumption of pomegranate juice, a 36% reduction in serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and a 5% reduction in systolic blood pressure were noted in hypertensive patients . Similar dose-dependent inhibitory effect (31%) of pomegranate juice on serum ACE activity was observed also in-vitro. Additional studies showed that pomegranate juice supplementation to atherosclerotic mice reduced macrophage lipid peroxidation, cellular cholesterol accumulation and development of atherosclerosis (Kaplan et al. 2001 ) . Pomegranate juice supplementation reduced each of the proatherogenic variables. It signi fi cantly induced serum paraoxonase activity and reduced mouse peritoneal macrophage (MPM) lipid peroxide content compared with placebo-treated mice and control mice. Pomegranate juice administration to apolipoprotein E-de fi cient E o mice signi fi cantly reduced the oxidized (Ox)-LDL MPM uptake by 31% and MPM cholesterol esteri fi cation and increased macrophage cholesterol ef fl ux by 39% compared with age-matched, placebo-treated mice. Pomegranate juice consumption reduced macrophage Ox-LDL uptake and cholesterol esteri fi cation to levels lower than those in 4-month-old, unsupplemented controls. Pomegranate juice supplementation to E o mice with advanced atherosclerosis reduced the lesion size by 17% compared with place botreated mice. In a separate study, supple mentation of young (2-month-old) E o mice for 2 months with a tannin fraction isolated from pomegranate juice reduced their atherosclerotic lesion size, paralleled by reduced plasma lipid peroxidation and decreased Ox-LDL MPM uptake. Studies indicated that the proatherogenic effects induced by perturbed shear stress in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells could be reversed by chronic administration of pomegranate juice (de Nigris et al. 2005 (de Nigris et al. , 2007 . Pomegranate juice concentrate and pomegranate fruit extract rich in punicalagin reduced the activation of redox-sensitive genes ELK-1, p-JUN, p-CREB, and increased eNOS expression (which was decreased by perturbed shear stress) in cultured endothelial cells and in atherosclerosis-prone areas of hypercholesterolemic mice. Furthermore, oral administration of pomegranate juice to hypercholesterolemic mice at various stages of disease reduced signi fi cantly the progression of atherosclerosis and isoprostane levels and increased nitrates. de found that pomegranate juice reverted the potent downregulation of the expression of endothelial nitricoxide synthase (NOSIII) induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in human coronary endothelial cells. Their data suggested that pomegranate juice could exert bene fi cial effects on the evolution of clinical vascular complications, coronary heart disease, and atherogenesis in humans by enhancing the nitric-oxide synthase bioactivity. Aviram et al. ( 2002 ) reported that pomegranate polyphenols protected low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against cell-mediated oxidation via two pathways, including either direct interaction of the polyphenols with the lipoprotein and/or an indirect effect through accumulation of polyphenols in arterial macrophages (Aviram et al. 2002 ) . Pomegranate polyphenols were shown to reduce the capacity of macrophages to oxidatively modify LDL, due to their interaction with LDL to inhibit its oxidation by scavenging reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species and also due to accumulation of polyphenols in arterial macrophages; hence, the inhibition of macrophage lipid peroxidation and the formation of lipid peroxide-rich macrophages. Additionally, pomegranate polyphenols increased serum paraoxonase activity, resulting in the hydrolysis of lipid peroxides in oxidized lipoproteins and in atherosclerotic lesions. These antioxidative and antiatherogenic effects of pomegranate polyphenols were demonstrated in-vitro, as well as in-vivo in humans and in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E de fi cient mice. Dietary supplementation of polyphenol-rich pomegranate juice to atherosclerotic mice signi fi cantly inhibited the development of atherosclerotic lesions and this may be attributed to the protection of LDL against oxidation.",

For all studied parameters, the maximal effects were observed after 1 year of pomegranate juice consumption. Further consumption of pomegranate juice, for up to 3 years, had no additional bene fi cial effects on IMT and serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) activity, whereas serum lipid peroxidation was further reduced by up to 16% after 3 years of pomegranate juice consumption. The antiatherogenic properties of pomegranate juice (PJ) were attributed to its antioxidant potency and to its capacity to decrease macrophage oxidative stress, the hallmark of early atherogeneis (Rosenberg et al. 2006 ). Pomegranate juice polyphenols and sugar-containing polyphenolic anthocyanins were shown to confer PJ its antioxidant capacity. Their study showed that PJ sugar consumption by diabetic mice for 10 days resulted in a small but signi fi cant decrement in their peritoneal macrophage total peroxide levels and an increment in cellular glutathione content, compared to mouse peritoneal macrophages harvested from control diabetic mice administrated with water. These antioxidant/antiatherogenic effects could be due to the presence of unique complex sugars and/or phenolic sugars in PJ. They further showed the anti-oxidative characteristics of PJ unique phenolics punicalagin and gallic acid could be related, at least in part, to their stimulatory effect on macrophage paraoxonase 2 (PON2) expression, a phenomenon which was shown to be associated with activation of the transcription factors PAPR \u03b3 and AP-1 (Shiner et al. 2007 ) . Similar results were obtained by pomegranate byproduct (which includes the whole pomegranate fruit left after juice preparation) (17 or 51.5 m g of gallic acid equiv/kg/day) administration to apolipoprotein e-de fi cient mice that resulted in attenuation of atherosclerosis development as a result of decreased macrophage oxidative stress and reduced cellular uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Rosenblat et al. 2006 ) . In-vitro studies showed that preincubation of J774.A1 macrophages with pomegranate juice resulted in a signi fi cant reduction in Ox-LDL degradation by 40% (Fuhrman et al. 2005 ) . Macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis was inhibited by 50% after cell incubation with pomegranate juice. This inhibition, however, was not mediated at the 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase level along the biosynthetic pathway. It was concluded that pomegranate juice-mediated suppression of Ox-LDL degradation and of cholesterol biosynthesis in macrophages could lead to reduced cellular cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation.",

Pomegranate juice consumption by hypertensive patients reduced their systolic blood pressure (by 6%), along with inhibition (by 40%) of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Pomegranate juice supplementation to atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-de fi cient (E\u00b0) mice reduced their atherosclerotic lesion size by 44% and the number of foam cells in their lesion. Consumption of pomegranate juice by ten patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) for 1 year reduced the patients' carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) by 32%. These effects were associated with exvivo reduced lipid peroxidation in plasma and in isolated lipoproteins in humans and mice. Furthermore, pomegranate juice consumption by humans increased the activity of their serum paraoxonase (PON1), an HDL-associated esterase that protects against lipid peroxidation. Macrophage atherogenicity was studied in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) harvested from E\u00b0 mice. Following pomegranate juice consumption, uptake of oxidized LDL and cell-mediated oxidation of LDL by macrophages was reduced by 88 and by 20%, respectively, in association with reduced cellular lipid peroxidation, reduced superoxide anion release due to decreased NADPH-oxidase activation, and elevated glutathione content. In-vitro studies demonstrated that pomegranate juice reduced macrophage Ox-LDL degradation by 40%, and macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis by 50%.

After consumption of pomegranate juice, fruit peel, aril and fl ower extracts the atherosclerotic lesion area in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein e-de fi cient (E 0) mice was signi fi cantly decreased by 44, 38, 39, 6, or 70%, respectively, as compared to placebo-treated group, while pomegranate seed oil had no effect. Pomegrante fl ower consumption reduced serum lipids, and glucose levels by 18-25%. Consumption of the extracts except for the seed oil resulted in a signi fi cant decrement, by 53, 42, 35, 27, or 13%, respectively, in MPM (mouse peritoneal macrophage) total peroxides content, and increased cellular paraoxonase 2 (PON2) activity, as compared to placebo-treated mice. The uptake rates of oxidized-LDL by E (0)-MPM were signi fi cantly reduced by approximately 15% after consumption of juice and the two fruit peel extracts. Similar results were obtained on using J774A.1 macrophage cell line. Finally, pomegranate phenolics (punicalagin, punicalin, gallic acid, and ellagic acid), as well as pomegranate unique complexed sugars, could mimic the antiatherogenic effects of the pomegranate extracts. Rock et al.

PON1 protein binding to HDL was signi fi cantly increased by 30% following pomegranate juice consumption, and the enzyme became more stable. In male patients that consumed pomegranate polyphenol extract and in female patients that consumed pomegranate juice, a similar pattern was observed, although to a lesser extent. These bene fi cial effects of pomegranate consumption on serum PON1 stability and activity could lead to retardation of atherosclerosis development in diabetic patients.",

Lei et al. ( 2007 ) reported that the pomegranate leaf extract could inhibit the development of obesity and hyperlipidemia in high-fat diet induced obese mice. Mice treated with the extract presented a signi fi cant decrease in body weight, energy intake and various adipose pad weight percents and serum, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), glucose levels and TC/highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio after 5 weeks treatment. Further, the extract signi fi cantly attenuated the raising of the serum TG level and inhibited the intestinal fat absorption in mice given a fat emulsion orally. The effects were postulated to be partly mediated by inhibiting the pancreatic lipase activity and suppressing energy intake. Yamasaki et al. ( 2006 ) found that mice fed dietary pomegranate seed oil (PSO) high in levels of punicic acid showed signi fi cant increases in serum triacylglycerol and phospholipid levels but not in total cholesterol. Punicic acid could be detected in serum, liver, and adipose tissues in mice fed the 0.12 or 1.2% PSO diet. Oral administration of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats with of 250 and 500 mg/kg of aqueous pomegranate fl ower extract for 21 days resulted in a signi fi cant fall in fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , very low density lipoprotein, lipid peroxidation level (Bagri et al. 2009 ) . Pomegrante extract elevated levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), reduced glutathione (GSH) and the antioxidative enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). McFarlin et al. ( 2009 ) found that weight gain in high fat diet mice was associated with an increase in biomarkers of cholesterol pro fi le, glucose sensitivity, adipose tissue accumulation and systemic low-grade in fl ammation. despite a similar level of energy intake, high-fate diet mice had a greater concentration of leptin and a lower concentration of adiponectin compared to high fat + pomegranate seed oil diet mice. Pomegranate seed oil, a rich source of 9-cis , 11-trans conjugate linolenic acid, only altered body weight accumulation, fi nal body weight, leptin, adiponectin and insulin. Pomegranate seed oil intake was associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity, suggesting that risk of developing type two diabetes may have been reduced; however, CVD risk did not change. Lan et al. ( 2009 ) demonstrated that ellagic acid in pomegranate leaf tannins could be transported into HepG2 cells and this correlated with total cholesterol alteration in the cells. Vroegrijk et al. ( 2011 ) found that pomegranate seed oil, a rich source of punicic acid, ameliorated high-fat diet induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice, independent of changes in food intake or energy expenditure. compared to high fat diet mice, its intake resulted in a lower body weight and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity but did not affect liver insulin sensitivity. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 20 obese adult volunteer, pomegranate juice administration for 1 month did not modify insulin secretion and sensitivity in the obese patients, however, the natural evolution to increased weight and adiposity was halted (Gonz\u00e1lez-Ortiz et al. 2011 ) . Rosenblat and Aviram ( 2011 ) found that the inhibitory effect of pomegranate juice on triglyceride biosynthesis could be attributed to a direct effect of pomegranate juice on the activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) the rate-limiting enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis. Pomegranate juice and its constituent punicalagin signi fi cantly and dose-dependently decreased the triglyceride content and triglyceride biosynthesis rate in J774A.1 macrophages or in C57BL/6 mouse peritoneal macrophages. Both pomegranate juice and punicalagin increased (1.7-fold) mouse peritoneal macrophages paraoxonase 2 (PON2) mRNA expression, and PON2 was previously shown to inhibit DGAT1 activity. However, the addition of PJ or punicalagin (50 m M) to microsomes from PON2-de fi cient mouse peritoneal macrophages still resulted in a signi fi cant reduction (50-58%) in DGAT1 activity.",

Pomegranate juice administration signi fi cantly decreased the serum levels of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) and the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); while enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GSH) in kidney tissue showed a signi fi cant elevation in pomegranate juice treated angiotensin-II induced hypertensive rats. The results suggested that pomegranate juice extract could prevent the development of high blood pressure induced by angiotensin-II probably by combating the oxidative stress and antagonizing the physiological actions of angiotensin-II. Chronic administration of pomegranate fruit juice (PJ) extract (100 and 300 mg/kg; p.o. for 4 weeks) reduced the mean arterial blood pressure and vascular reactivity changes to various catecholamines and also reversed the biochemical changes induced by diabetes and angiotensin II (Ang II) (Mohan et al. 2010 b ) . Acute subcutaneous administration of Angiotensin II causes a rise in blood pressure in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats. PJ treatment also caused a signi fi cant decrease in levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the kidney and pancreas while activities of enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GSH) showed signi fi cant elevation. PJ treatment prevented the tubular degenerative changes induced by diabetes. The results suggested that the PJ extract could prevent the development of high blood pressure induced by Ang II in diabetic rats probably by combating the oxidative stress induced by diabetes and Ang II and by inhibiting ACE activity.",

            "text": "Pomegranate in particular its fl owers, seeds, and juice have been employed for the treatment of various diseases in traditional Unani and Ayurvedic systems of medicine in India but only the fl ower has been prescribed for the treatment of diabetic disorders Katz et al. 2007 ) . The mechanisms for it hypoglycaemic effects are largely unknown, though recent research suggested pomegranate fl owers and juice may prevent diabetic sequelae via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1/\u03b3 binding and nitric oxide production (Katz et al. 2007 ; Huang et al. 2005a, b ; Li et al. 2008 ; Xu et al. 2009 ) . Pomegranate compounds associated with such effects include oleanolic, ursolic, and gallic acids (Katz et al. 2007 ) . Another study suggested that Punica granatum fl ower (PGF) extract inhibited increased cardiac fatty acid uptake and oxidation in the diabetic condition (Huang et al. 2005b ) . PGF extract and its component oleanolic acid enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1 luciferase reporter gene activity in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This effect was completely suppressed by a selective PPAR-\u03b1 antagonist MK-886, consistent with the presence of PPAR-\u03b1 activator activity in the extract and this component. The fi ndings suggested that PGF extract improved abnormal cardiac lipid metabolism in Zucker diabetic fatty rats by activating PPAR-\u03b1 and thereby lowering circulating lipid and inhibiting its cardiac uptake. Excess triglyceride (TG) accumulation and increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation in the diabetic heart contribute to cardiac dysfunction. In subsequent in-vitro studies, the scientists (Huang et al. 2005a ) demonstrated that 6-week oral administration of methanol extract from PGF (500 mg/kg, daily) inhibited glucose loading-induced increase of plasma glucose levels in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF), a genetic animal model for type two diabetes, whereas it did not inhibit the increase in Zucker lean rats (ZL). The treatment did not lower the plasma glucose levels in fasted ZDF and ZL rats. Further, RT-PCR results demonstrated that the PGF extract treatment in ZDF rats enhanced cardiac PPAR-\u03b3 mRNA expression and restored the down-regulated cardiac glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 (the insulin-dependent isoform of GLUTs) mRNA. These results suggest that the anti-diabetic activity of PGF extract may result from improved sensitivity of the insulin receptor. From the in-vitro studies, it was demonstrated that the PGF extract enhanced PPAR-\u03b3 mRNA and protein expression and increased PPAR-\u03b3-dependent mRNA expression and activity of lipoprotein lipase in human THP-1-differentiated macrophage cells. Phytochemical investigation demonstrated that gallic acid in PGF extract was mostly responsible for this activity. Further in-vitro studies showed that Punica granatum fl ower extract and its components oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and gallic acid inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB activation in macrophages. The fi ndings indicated that Punica granatum fl ower extract reduced cardiac fi brosis in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, at least in part, by modulating cardiac ET-1 and NF-kappaB signalling. Recent studies suggested that pomegranate fl ower (PGF) medicine ameliorated diabetes and obesity-associated fatty liver, at least in part, by activating hepatic expression of genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation ) . PGF-treated ZDF rats showed reduced ratio of liver weight to tibia length, hepatic triglyceride contents and lipid droplets. These effects were accompanied by enhanced hepatic gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and reduced stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1. In contrast, PGF showed minimal effects on expression of genes responsible for synthesis, hydrolysis or uptake of fatty acid and triglycerides.",

( 2008 ) reviewed the dual PPAR-\u03b1/-\u03b3 activator properties of pomegranate fl ower and its potential treatment of diabetes and its associated complications. PPARs are nuclear transcription factors and are the major regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism. PPAR-\u03b1 is involved in the regulation of fatty acid (FA) uptake and oxidation, in fl ammation and vascular function, while PPAR-\u03b3 participates in FA uptake and storage, glucose homeostasis and in fl am mation. Synthetic PPAR-\u03b1 or PPAR-\u03b3 agonists have been widely used in the treatment of dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and their complications. However, they are associated with an incidence of adverse events. Given the favourable metabolic effects of both PPAR-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3 activators, as well as their potential to modulate vascular disease, com bined PPAR-\u03b1/-\u03b3 activation has recently emerged as a promising concept, leading to the development of mixed PPAR-\u03b1/-\u03b3 activators. Hontecillas et al. ( 2009 ) demonstrated that punicic acid (PUA), a conjugated linolenic acid isomer found in pomegranate, caused a dosedependent increase PPAR \u03b1 and \u03b3 reporter activity in 3 T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells and bound although weakly to the ligand-binding domain of human PPAR \u03b3. Dietary PUA decreased fasting plasma glucose concentrations, improved the glucose-normalizing ability, suppressed NF-kappaB activation, TNF-\u03b1 expression and upregulated PPAR \u03b1and \u03b3-responsive genes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. PUA improved glucose homeostasis and suppress obesity-related in fl ammation Studies in India showed that pomegranate seed extract (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg) administered orally to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats caused a signi fi cant reduction of blood glucose levels by 47 and 52%, respectively, at the end of 12 h (Das et al. 2001 ) . Kim et al. ( 2011 ) found that administration of pomegranate extract to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice for 4 weeks improved postprandial glucose regulation. Further elevated Na(+)-dependent glucose uptake by brush border membrane vesicles isolated from STZ mice was normalized by pomegranate treatment. The results suggested that pomegranate extract could play a role in controlling the dietary glucose absorption at the intestinal tract by decreasing sodium-coupled glucose transporter SGLT1 expression, and may contribute to blood glucose homeostasis in the diabetic condition.",

The extract was found to markedly inhibit the increase of plasma glucose levels after sucrose loading, but not after glucose loading in mice, and it had no effect on glucose levels in normal mice. In-vitro, PGF extract demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect on \u03b1-glucosidase activity (IC 50 : 1.8 m g/mL). These fi ndings strongly suggested that PGF extract improved postprandial hyperglycemia in type two diabetes and obesity, at least in part, by inhibiting intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase activity. Postprandial hyperglycemia plays an important role in the development of type two diabetes and has been proposed as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

( 2005 ) showed that pomegranate fruit extract or compounds derived from it may inhibit cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis and may also be a useful nutritive supplement for maintaining joint integrity and function. The extract inhibited interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases by suppressing the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappaB in human chondrocytes in-vitro. Pomegranate methanol extract was found to dose-dependently inhibit tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated cells (Jung et al. 2006 ) . The data suggested that the extract may suppress LPS-stimulated TNF production through inhibition of Nfkappab in BV2 microglia cells. Shukla et al. ( 2008b ) reported that consumption of hydrolyzable tannins-rich pomegranate extract potently delayed the onset and reduced the incidence and severity of collagen-induced arthritis in mice. Pomegranate extract -fed mice had reduced joint in fi ltration by the in fl ammatory cells, and the destruction of bone and cartilage were alleviated. Levels of interleukin IL-6 were signi fi cantly decreased in the joints of pomegranate-fed mice with collagen-induced arthritis. In mouse macrophages, pomegranate extract abolished multiple signal transduction pathways and downstream mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. In another study, rabbit plasma samples collected after oral ingestion of polyphenol rich pomegranate fruit extract were found to inhibit the IL-1\u03b2-induced PGE2 and NO production in chondrocytes (Shukla et al. 2008a ) . These same plasma samples also inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme activity ex-vivo but the effect was more pronounced on the enzyme activity of COX-2 enzyme. The studies suggested that pomegranate fruit extract-derived bioavailable compounds may exert an anti -in fl ammatory effect by inhibiting the in fl ammatory cytokineinduced production of PGE2 and NO in-vivo. Pomegranate extract rich in polyphenols was found to inhibit the interleukin-1 b -induced activation of MKK-3, p38 a -MAPK and transcription factor RUNX-2 in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes (Rasheed et al. 2010 ) . This pharmacological actions of pomegranate extract suggest that the extract or its derived compounds may be developed as MKK and p38-MAPK inhibitors for the treatment of osteoarthritis and other degenerative/ in fl ammatory diseases. In a pilot12 week openlabelled study, pomegranate consumption reduced the composite Disease Activity Index (DAS28) and tender joint count in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and this effect could be related to the antioxidative property of pomegranates (Balbir-Gurman et al. 2011 ) . The results suggested dietary supplementation with pomegranates may be a useful complementary strategy to attenuate clinical symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis patients.",

Histopathological studies of the liver supported the hepatoprotective effects exhibited by the extract by restoring the normal hepatic architecture. Kaur et al. ( 2006 ) demonstrated that pre-treatment of mice with pomegranate fl ower extract at a dose regimen of 50-150 mg/ kg body weight for a week signi fi cantly and dose dependently protected against ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative stress as well as hepatic injury. The extract conferred up to 60% protection against hepatic lipid peroxidation and preserved glutathione (GSH) levels and activities of antioxidant enzymes viz., catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) by up to 36, 28.5, 28.7, 40.2 and 42.5% respectively. A protection against Fe-NTA induced liver injury was apparent as inhibition in the modulation of liver markers viz., aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and albumin in serum. The histopathological changes produced by Fe-NTA, such as ballooning degeneration, fatty changes, necrosis were also alleviated by the extract. The fl ower extract was found to signi fi cantly scavenge superoxide radicals by up to 53.3%, hydrogen peroxide by up to 30%, hydroxyl radicals by up to 37% and nitric oxide by up to 74.5%. The extract also inhibited (.)OH induced oxidation of lipids and proteins in vitro. The potent antioxidant property of the fl ower extract was postulated to be responsible for its hepatoprotective effects. In another study, pomegranate fl ower infusion was found to exhibit hepatoprotective and antioxidant effect against trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-exposed rats (Celik et al. 2009 ) . The infusion signi fi cantly decreased levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase; increased signi fi cantly glutathione S-transferase activity in the liver, brain and spleen and maintained superoxide dismustase level in the liver.",

All studied enzymatic activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase) were found to be decreased by pomegranate juice treatment. Also, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione synthetase transcription were also decreased in this group. Chronic pomegranate peel extract administration to rats alleviated the bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced oxidative injury of the liver and improved the hepatic structure and function (Toklu et al. 2007 ) . Plasma antioxidant capacity and hepatic glutathione levels were signi fi cantly depressed by BDL but were increased back to control levels in the pomegranate extract-treated BDL group. Increases in tissue malondialdehyde levels and myeloperoxidase activity due to BDL were reduced back to control levels by pomegranate extract treatment. Similarly, increased hepatic collagen content in the BDL rats was reduced to the level of the control group with extract treatment. Sumner et al. ( 2005 ) showed that daily consumption of pomegranate juice may improve stressinduced myocardial ischemia in patients who have coronary heart disease in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. After 3 months, the extent of stress-induced ischemia decreased in the pomegranate group (SDS \u2212 0.8 \u00b1 2.7) but increased in the control group (SDS 1.2 \u00b1 3.1). This bene fi t was observed without changes in cardiac medications, blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, weight, or blood pressure in either group. Mohan et al. ( 2010a ) demonstrated that pre-treatment of male Wistar rats with pomegranate juice (100 and 300 mg/kg, p.o.) and its butanolic extract(100 mg/kg., p.o.) for a period of 21 days signi fi cantly inhibited the effects of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction such as heart rate, pressure rate index, ECG patterns, levels of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, superoxide dismutase and catalase in the serum and vascular reactivity changes. Treatment with PJ and B-PJ (100 mg/kg., p.o.) alone did not alter any of the parameters as compared to vehicletreated Wistar rats. Hassanpour et al. ( 2011 ) found that pomegranate fruit extract displayed cardioprotective doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats administered the extract showed decreased QT and increase in heart rate compared to the Dox group Signi fi cant decrease in creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme, lactate dehydrogenase and no such signi fi cant decrease in aspartate aminotransferase were observed as compared to the Dox group. There was signi fi cant increase in the level of reduced glutathione, whereas inhibition of lipid peroxidation and increase in superoxide dismutase concentration was not signi fi cant in the extract treated group compared to the Dox group. Histopathological study of the extract -treated group showed slight protection against myocardial toxicity induced by Dox.",

The acid content of the stomach was signi fi cantly increased by pomegranate (368%) suggesting that monomeric and polymeric polyphenols could strengthen the gastric mucosal barrier. Administration of 70% methanolic pomegranate rind extract inhibited aspirin-and ethanol-induced gastric ulceration (Ajaikumar et al. 2005 ) . Treated animals showed increased antioxidant levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and decreased level of tissue lipid peroxidation. No erosion of gastric mucosa, sub-mucosal edema and neutrophil in fi ltration was observed in treated animals. Pomegranate tannins (500, 150, 50 mg/ kg) signi fi cantly inhibited ulcerative formation induced by both water immersion stress and pylorus ligation, and decreased the gastric mucosa damages induced by intragastric absolute ethanol, in dose-dependent manner in rats (Lai et al. 2009 ) . Its antiulcer effect was found to be due to increasing secretion of adherent mucus and free mucus from the stomach wall, which may inhibit generation of oxygen-derived free radicals, and decrease the consumption glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), decrease absolute alcohol-induced elevation of malondialdehyde and maintain content of NO at normal level. Punica granatum peel extract (PPE) supplementation of irradiated rats reduced oxidative damage in the ileal tissues and protected against ionizing radiation-induced enteritis and leukocyte apoptosis in rats, probably by a mechanism associated with the decreased production of reactive oxygen metabolites and enhancement of antioxidant mechanisms (Toklu et al. 2009 ) . PPE treatment reversed all these biochemical indices induced by irradiations such as the decrease in glutathione and total antioxidant capacity associated with increases in malondialdehyde levels, myeloperoxidase activity, collagen content of the tissue with a concomitant increase 8-hydroxy-2 \u00a2deoxyguanosine (an index of oxidative DNA damage) and increases in pro-in fl ammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) and lactate dehydrogenase. histopathological alterations and the increase in leukocyte apoptosis and cell death induced by irradiation was also reversed by PPE.",

It also enhanced the inhibition of leucocyte migration in Leucocyte Migration Inhibition test and induration of skin in delayed hypersensitivity test with Puri fi ed Protein Derivative (PPD) con fi rming its stimulatory effect on cell-mediated immune response. Punicalagin isolated from pomegranate fruit was found to be a potent immune suppressant, based on its inhibitory action on the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Punicalagin downregulated the mRNA and soluble protein expression of interleukin-2 from anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated murine splenic CD4+ T cells and suppressed mixed leukocytes reaction (MLR) without exhibiting cytotoxicity to the cells. In vivo, the punicalagin treatment inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)induced chronic ear edema in mice and decreased CD3+ T cell in fi ltration of the in fl amed tissue. The results suggested that punicalagin could be a potential candidate for the therapeutics of various immune pathologies. Yamasaki et al.

            "text": "Wistar rats with excision wounds treated with 5% water-soluble gel formulated from the methanolic extract of dried pomegranate rind, showed good complete wound healing after 10 days (Chidambara Murthy et al. 2004 ) . In comparison in rats treated with 2.5% gel, healing was observed on day 12, and in the positive control animals receiving the blank gel took 16-18 days for complete healing. Collagen content in terms of hydroxyproline level increased by two-fold in the group treated with 5.0% gel. The gel extract was found to contain gallic acid and catechin as major components. Aslam et al. ( 2006 ) found that pomegranate seed oil, but not aqueous extracts of fermented juice, peel or seed cake, stimulated human keratinocyte proliferation in monolayer culture. Contrariwise, pomegranate peel aqueous extract (and to a lesser extent, both the fermented juice and seed cake extracts) stimulated type I procollagen synthesis and inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1; interstitial collagenase) production by dermal fi broblasts, but had no growth-supporting effect on keratinocytes. The results suggested that pomegranate peel aqueous extract could promote regeneration of dermis and pomegranate seed oil could promote regeneration of epidermis. Pomegranate peel methanol extract-based ointment signi fi cantly enhanced wound contraction and the period of epithelialization as assessed by the mechanical (contraction rate, tensile strength), the biochemical (increasing of collagen, DNA and proteins synthesis) and the histopathological characteristics in guinea pigs (Hayouni et al. 2011 ) . The extract displayed antioxidant activity as potent as natural and synthetic compounds (Trolox, Butylated hydroxyanisole, Quercetin). In addition, the extract exhibited signi fi cant antibacterial and antifungal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Salmonella anatum , Salmonella typhimurium , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and fungi Candida albicans , Candida glabrata , Trichopyton rubrum and Aspergillus niger. The results suggested that the pomegranate formulated ointment may be used as skin repair agent without hazard to human health. The ethanol extract of P. granatum fl owers showed signi fi cant wound healing activity when topically administered in rats (Pirbalouti et al. 2010 ) . The extract signi fi cantly increased the rate of wound contraction and collagen turnover.",

Similarly, they reported pomegranate fruit extract to be an effective agent for ameliorating UVA-mediated skin damages by modulating cellular pathways in-vitro (Syed et al. 2006 ) . UVA-mediated cellular damage occurs primarily through the release of reactive oxygen species and is responsible for immunosuppression, photodermatoses, photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Pretreatment of normal human epidermal keratinocytes with the extract (60-100 m g/ mL) for 24 h before exposure to UVA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of UVA-mediated phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), protein kinase B/ AKT and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) viz. extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). The extract pretreatment also inhibited UVA exposure-mediated increases in Ki-67 antigen and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and increased the cell-cycle arrest induced by UVA in the G1 phase and the expression of Bax and Bad (proapoptotic proteins), while suppressing Bcl-X(L) antiapoptotic protein expression. Studies by Zaid et al. ( 2007 ) showed that pretreatment of human immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes with polyphenol-rich pomegranate fruit extract inhibited UVB-mediated decrease in cell viability, decrease in intracellular glutathione content and increase in lipid peroxidation. immunoblot analysis showed that pretreatment of HaCaT cells with pomegranate fruit extract inhibited UVB-induced (1) upregulation of MMP-1, -2, -7 and -9, (2) decrease in TIMP-1, (3) phosphorylation of MAPKs and (iv) phosphorylation of c-jun, whereas no effect was observed on UVB-induced c-fos protein levels. The results suggested that pomegranate fruit protected HaCaT cells against UVB-induced oxidative stress and markers of photoaging and could be a useful supplement in skin care products.",

This photoprotective effect was postulated to be related to a reduced activation of the pro-in fl ammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB, suppression of proapoptotic caspase-3, and an increased G0/G1 phase, associated with DNA repair. Higher polyphenolic concentrations (500-10,000 mg/L) were required to achieve a signi fi cant reduction in UV-induced reactive oxygen species levels and increased intracellular antioxidant capacity. Pretreatment of reconstituted human skin \"Epiderm\" with pomegranate-derived products POMx juice, POMx extract and pomegranate oil inhibited UVB-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 8-dihydro-2 \u00a2deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), protein oxidation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein expression (Afaq et al. 2009 ) . Further, pretreatment of Epiderm with pomegranate-derived products resulted in inhibition of UVB-induced collagenase (MMP-1), gelatinase (MMP-2, MMP-9), stromelysin (MMP-3), marilysin (MMP-7), elastase (MMP-12), and tropoelastin. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were also inhibited. Overall, the results suggested that all three pomegranate-derived products may be useful against UVB-induced damage to human skin. Park et al. ( 2010 ) using cultured human skin fi broblasts, demonstrated that pomegranate fruit rind extract rich in polyphenols catechin, quercetin, kaempferol, and equol signi fi cantly protected against UVB-induced skin damage.

Ellagic acid and punicalagin were less inhibitory to \u03b1-secretase (TACE) and other serine proteases such as chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase, thus indicating that they were relatively speci fi c inhibitors of BACE1. b -Secretase is an aspartic-acid protease involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease Studies showed that ethanolic extract of P. granatum seeds signi fi cantly exhibited the anxiolytic activity animal models of elevated plus maze test, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, tail suspension test, hot-plate and tail-fl ick tests (Kumar et al. 2008 ) . The extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) signi fi cantly increased the sleeping latency and reduced the sleeping time. Tail suspension test showed that the extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) was able to induce a signi fi cant decrease in the immobility time, similar to imipramine, a recognized antidepressant drug. Tail-fl ick and hot-plate tests exhibited antinociceptive property of pomegranate extract, similar to morphine, a recognized antinociceptive agent. Phytochemical screening and measurement of reducing power revealed the central nervous system (CNS) activity of ethanol extract of pomegranate seeds may be due to its antioxidative pro fi le.",

Supplementation of pomegranate fl owers restored the elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and decreased level of glutathione towards their control values. Daily pomegranate fl ower supplementation to diabetic rats reduced the increase in glial-fi brilar acidic protein (GFAP) contents induced by diabetes in the hippocampus. The observations suggested that pomegranate fl ower supplementation decreased oxidative stress and amelioratedimpairment in learning and memory performances in diabetic rats and may be clinically useful in treating neuronal de fi cit in diabetic patients. Loren et al. ( 2005 ) found that maternal dietary supplementation with pomegranate juice was neuroprotective in an animal model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Dietary supplementation with pomegranate juice resulted in markedly decreased brain tissue loss (>60%) in all three brain regions assessed, with the highest pomegranate juice dose having greatest signi fi cance Pomegranate juice also diminished caspase-3 activation by 84% in the hippocampus and 64% in the cortex. In further studies, the scientists showed that pomegranate polyphenols and resveratrol reduced caspase-3 activation following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury (West et al. 2007 ) . In separate study, transgenic mice (APP(sw)/Tg2576) treated with pomegranate juice had signi fi cantly less (approximately 50%) accumulation of soluble A\u03b242 and amyloid deposition in the hippocampus as compared to control mice (Hartman et al. 2006 ) . Mice administered pomegranate juice learned water maze tasks more quickly and swam faster than controls. The results suggest that pomegranate juice may be useful in Alzheimer's disease and warrant further studies. Choi et al.

Additionally, the extract inhibited neuronal cell death caused by A b -induced oxidative stress and A b -induced learning and memory de fi ciency in mice.",

            "text": "The molluscicidal activity of P. granatum bark and Canna indica root against the snail, Lymnaea acuminata was found to be both time and dose dependent (Tripathi and Singh 2000 ) . The toxicity of P. granatum bark was more pronounced than that of C. indica . The 24 h LC 50 of the C. indica was 6.54 mg/L whereas that of the bark of P. granatum was 4.39 mg/L. The ethanol extract of P. granatum (24 h LC 50 : 22.42 mg/L) was more effective than the ethanol extract of C. indica (24 h LC 50 : 55.65 mg/L) in killing the test animals. P. granatum and C. indica may be used as potent molluscicides since the concentrations used to kill the snails were not toxic to the fi sh Colisa fasciatus , sharing the same habitat with the snail. In a subsequent study, Tripathi et al. ( 2004 ) reported that sub-lethal 24 h exposure to active fraction of pomegranate bark separately or in combination with Canna roots signi fi cantly inhibited the activity of acetylcholinesterase, acid/alkaline phosphatase, Na(+)K(+)ATPase and lactic dehydrogenase in the nervous tissue of Lymnaea acuminata. Lei et al. ( 2003 ) found that ellagic acid, the principal bioactive component of pomegranate leaf extract, had poor absorption and rapid elimination after oral administration pomegranate leaf extract, and part of it was absorbed from stomach. Studies in rats showed that only 3-6% of the ingested punicalagin was detected as such or as metabolites in urine and faeces (Cerd\u00e1 et al. 2003b ) . Only traces of punicalagin metabolites being detected in liver or kidney. The transformation of ellagic acid derivatives to 6H-dibenzo[b,d] pyran-6-one derivatives in the rat was con fi rmed. Studies of Cerd\u00e1 et al. ( 2004 ) found that the potential systemic biological effects of pomegranate juice ingestion should be attributed to the colonic micro fl ora metabolites rather than to the polyphenols present in the juice. Neither the potent antioxidant punicalagin nor ellagic acid present in pomegranate juice were detected in both plasma and urine on ingestion of pomegranate juice. Three microbial ellagitannin-derived metabolites were detected: 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one glucuronide, an unidenti fi ed aglycone (tentatively, trihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one) and hydroxy-6-Hdibenzo [b,d] pyran-6-one glucuronide in the plasma and urine. The metabolites did not show signi fi cant antioxidant activity compared to punicalagin from pomegranate juice. In separate studies, ellagic acid was detected in human plasma at a maximum concentration (31.9 ng/mL) after 1 h post-ingestion of pomegranate juice but was rapidly eliminated by 4 h (Seeram et al. 2004 ) . Six hours post-ingestion of pomegranate juice, ellagic acid (EA) was detected in plasma of all healthy human volunteers with a maximum concentration of 0.06 m mol/L, area under concentration time curve of 0.17 ( m mol \u00d7 h) \u00d7 L(-1), time of maximum concentration of 0.98 h, and elimination half-life of 0.71 h . Ellagic acid metabolites, including dimethylellagic acid glucuronide (DMEAG) and hydroxy-6H-benzopyran-6-one derivatives (urolithins), were also detected in plasma and urine in conjugated and free forms. DMEAG was found in the urine obtained from 15 of 18 subjects on day 0, but was not detected on d \u22121 (day before) or +1 (day after), demonstrating its potential as a biomarker of intake. Urolithin A-glucuronide was found in urine samples from 11 subjects on d 0 and in the urine from 16 subjects on d +1. Urolithin B-glucuronide was found in the urine of three subjects on d 0 and in the urine of fi ve subjects on d+1. The scientists asserted that urolithins, formed by intestinal bacteria, may contribute to the biological effects of pomegranate juice as they may persist in plasma and tissues and account for some of the health bene fi ts noted after chronic juice consumption. Studies by Seeram et al. ( 2008 ) found that pomegranate juice, pomegranate polyphenol liquid extract and pomegranate polyphenol powder extract provide similar levels of plasma and urinary ellagitannin metabolites such as urolithin A, in human subjects. There was a delay in time of maximum concentration of pomegranate powder extract compared to pomegranate juice and pomegranate polyphenol liquid. Mertens-Talcott et al. ( 2006 ) found ellagic acid from pomegranate extract to be bioavailable at 1 h after consumption by healthy volunteers. Its metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acidglucuronide were found in the plasma. The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. Vidal et al. ( 2003 ) found that in chick embryo model doses of hydroalcoholic pomegranate fruit extract of less than 0.1 mg per embryo were not toxic. The LD 50 of the extract, determined in OF-1 mice of both sexes after intraperitoneal administration, was 731 mg/kg. Con fi dence limits were 565-945 mg/kg. At the doses of 0.4 and 1.2 mg/kg of extract, the repeated intranasal administration to Wistar rats produced no toxic effects in terms of food intake, weight gain, behavioural or biochemical parameters, or results of histopathological studies. Cerd\u00e1 et al. ( 2003a ) found that repeated oral administration of high doses of the pomegranate ellagitannin punicalagin to rats for 37 days was not toxic. Punicalagin and related metabolites were identi fi ed in plasma, liver, and kidney. Five punicalagin-related metabolites were detected in liver and kidney, that is, two ellagic acid derivatives, gallagic acid, 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo [b,d] pyran-6-one glucuronide, and 3,8,10-trihydroxy-6H-dibenzo [b,d] pyran-6-one. Feedstuff intake, food utility index, and growth rate were lower in punicalagin treated rats during the fi rst 15 days without signi fi cant adverse effects, which could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet together with a decrease in its palatability (lower food intake). No signi fi cant differences were found in punicalagin treated rats in any blood parameter analyzed (including the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) with the exception of urea and triglycerides, which remained at low values throughout the study. Clinical studies by Heber et al. ( 2007 ) demonstrated the safety of a pomegranate ellagitannin-enriched polyphenol dietary supplement in overweight individuals with increased waist size and provided evidence of antioxidant activity in humans re fl ected by a signi fi cant reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) linked with cardiovascular disease risk. Patel et al. ( 2008 ) found that the no observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for a standardized pomegranate fruit extract was determined as 600 mg/kg body weight/day, the highest dose tested in rats. Compared to the control group, administration of the extract did not result in any toxicologically signi fi cant treatmentrelated changes in clinical observations, ophthalmic examinations, body weights, body weight gains, feed consumption, clinical pathology evaluations and organ weights.",

The fruit rind and stem bark have been used as a traditional remedy for diarrhoea, dysentery and intestinal parasites. Pomegranate pericarp has been commonly employed as a crude drug in Indian traditional medicine for the treatment of diarrhoea as well as for use as an astringent, antihelminthic, asphrodisacs, laxative, diuretic, stomachic, cardiotonic and refrigerant. The seeds and juice are considered as bitter and astringent and employed as a tonic for hear and throat ailments. The astringent qualities of the fl ower sap, fruit rind and tree bark are considered useful remedies for nose bleeds and gum bleeds, toning skin, (after mixing with mustard oil) fi rming-up sagging breasts and treating haemorrhoids. A syrup prepared from the fruit is useful in all bilious complaints. The juice of the fresh fruit is much esteemed in dyspepsia and as a cooling, thirst-quenching beverage in fever and sickness. The fruit juice is also found bene fi cial in leprosy. Pomegranate fruit juice has been used as eyedrops to treat cataracts.",

Pomegranate has been reported as a remedy for diabetes in the Unani system of medicine practiced in the Middle East and India. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians used the fruit rind, fl owers and root bark as astringents and the last as vermicide for treating tapeworms. In Malaysia, the root bark is used as vermifuge and powdered root bark is administered to children for stomach pains. The root is also used for diarrhoea and tits sap used for treating sore-eyes. Leaves are used in jamu preparations with a raft of other herbal ingredients for many medicinal complaints. Pounded leaves are used in a complex bolus for stomach ache and the fruit juice is recommended for coughs. In Singapore, the root bark has been used in as a component in a compound infusion or decoction taken by women for 40 days after childbirth. Other traditional uses of the fruit rind and root include as a treatment for snakebite (Jain and Puri 1984 ) , diabetes (Singh 1986 ) , burns (Siang 1983 ) , leprosy and assorted gynecological problems (Singh et al. 1980 ) . In Sri Lanka, the fresh fruit has been used as a refrigerant to lower fever (Arseculeratne et al. 1985 ) .",

Pomegranate has deep rooting system and is used for erosion control, planted along rivers to stabilize banks. An ideal suitable ornamental plant for gardens and amenity parks. Pomegranate grows along well as intercrop with grapes in Mediterranean countries. The tree is sometimes used for fencing and planted as boundary plants. Pomegranate leaf litter decomposes slowly and is suitable for mulching. The leaves are foraged by domesticated stock. Ink can be made by steeping the leaves in vinegar. Both the fruit rind and the fl owers yield dyes for textiles. The light-coloured wood is hard and durable, mostly used in making farm implements, walking-sticks and in woodcrafts as it is only available in small dimension. Tree branches are used as fi rewood. The bark is used in tanning and dyeing providing the yellow hue for Moroccan leather. Root bark yields a black ink rich in tannins. In Japan, an insecticide is derived from the bark.",
