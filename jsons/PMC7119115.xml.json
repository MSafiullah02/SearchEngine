The number of mobile teams was limited by availability of staff from the national health department and accessibility of the hospital. Mobile teams were generally led by a medical epidemiologist or other official from the national health department and often included members experienced in infection control, communications, and hospital engineering. Most teams were equipped with PPE, blood specimen tubes, nasopharyngeal swabs, culture media, and specimen cooler. Patients were later categorized as probable SARS, suspected SARS, or excluded from SARS after review by members of the national health department. Because of time and resource constraints, mobile teams generally visited a hospital only once during the observational period.",

We selected WHO recommendations, revised April 24, 2003, as a reasonable benchmark for comparison in this analysis (\nTable 1).14 The first version of WHO recommendations was initially released on March 16, 2003.16 Each national health department and other organizations had recommendations that varied over time. Since WHO indicated that a private negative pressure room was the preferred method to isolate a patient with SARS, we considered a private negative-pressure room the standard of comparison for patient isolation in this analysis, although other methods might be acceptable (eg, cohorting of patients with SARS). Team investigators used a strip of tissue paper to measure qualitatively the negative air pressure at the entrance of a patient's isolation room. We considered a double-layered gown equivalent to a single gown with an apron.",

(A) An anteroom that opens out to an open-air corridor in a hospital in Vientiane, Laos. : (1) Demonstration of the donning of personal protective equipment in an anteroom that opens to an open-air outside corridor that connects patient rooms on the ward. (B) Typical open-air ward in a rural hospital in Thailand. (2) Open doors leading from the open-air lobby to the patient ward. The open construction allows for cool ventilation but presents challenges to assuring patient isolation and negative pressure rooms. (C) Makeshift negative-pressure isolation room and anteroom in a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. (3) Medical staff, wearing minimal protective equipment, monitor care of a patient with SARS by looking through glass walls separating the nursing station from the anteroom and patient room. (4) Recently installed reinforcement bars and glass converting the hallway between the nursing station and the patient's room into an enclosed anteroom. (5) Window fan directing air flow from the patient's room to an untrafficked area outside. (6) In the patient isolation room, a nurse wearing personal protective equipment that includes a powered air-purifying respirator while caring for a patient with confirmed SARS. (D) Negative-pressure isolation room with high-efficiency particulate air filtration in Ilan, Taiwan. (7) Separate gauges measure air pressure in the anteroom and patient isolation room. (8) Door leading into the anteroom. On the other side, a closed door opens into the patient isolation room. (9) Closed double doors opening directly into the patient room.",
