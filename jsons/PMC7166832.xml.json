Precontrast T1 values of blood and myocardium were calculated from a set of four ECG\u2010gated, inversion recovery (IR), single\u2010shot, balanced steady\u2010state free precession (b\u2010SSFP) sequences (FOV = 300 \u00d7 285 mm, 90 lines acquired (using 80% scan percentage) reconstructed to 256 matrix, thickness = 8 mm, TR/TE/\u03b1 = 2.5 msec/1.2 msec/35\u00b0, readout duration = 225 msec). This sequence is similar to one presented previously (23), and hereafter is referred to as IRss. Magnetization preparation was performed with a nonselective adiabatic inversion pulse. Single\u2010shot imaging as a T1 measurement technique was used before contrast injection to eliminate the long repetition (and breath\u2010hold) times necessary to calculate longer blood and myocardial T1s at 3T. The inversion times (TIs) were slightly different at both field strengths to ensure points on either side of the zero\u2010crossing (1.5T: 400, 600, 1000, 1400 msec; 3T: 500, 800, 1100, 1500 msec). Because of the long TIs, a trigger delay was applied to provide imaging in diastole of the second heartbeat.",

Briefly, the two IR images (TI\u2010high and TI\u2010low) were identically scaled and divided (TI\u2010high/TI\u2010low). Since the imaging parameters were held constant (except for TI) and images scaled equivalently, the ratio of intensity values (intensity\u2010ratio) in each pixel was related to T1 by\n(4)equation image\nwhere TIhigh and TIlow represent the TIs used in each image. Equation [4] was solved numerically for T1 using a modified Newton\u2010Rapshon method performed in Matlab 6.5 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Note that the intensity\u2010ratio can have a positive or negative value, depending on the sign of the magnetization at the chosen TIs. Since only magnitude images were acquired in this analysis, the intensity\u2010ratio was always positive, which led to uncertainty about the true sign of the magnetization. This uncertainty resulted in two unique solutions in the 2pt\u2010IR analysis. However, by choosing a very low TI (TIlow \u2264 150 msec) coupled with a high TI, we assumed that the intensity\u2010ratio was always negative, even for the low blood T1's seen early after contrast injection (15, 16).",

            "text": "In all 10 subjects, the T1 of myocardium was 1.07 \u00b1 0.03 sec at 1.5T and 1.22 \u00b1 0.07 sec at 3 T, while blood T1 was 1.58 \u00b1 0.13 sec at 1.5T and 1.66 \u00b1 0.06 sec at 3T. The 3T values found in our study were roughly 8% higher than those reported by Noeske et al (2) (1.55 sec for blood and 1.12 sec for myocardium at 3T), which may reflect the different measurement techniques used. Noeske et al (2) utilized a partially refocused gradient\u2010echo in the steady\u2010state technique (GRASS) to measure T1 of myocardium and blood; however, they did not specify the segment TR and quantification method used. The T1 of blood at 1.5T was approximately 15\u201330% higher in our study compared to previously reported values (1.20 sec (3, 27), 1.23 sec (16), 1.38 sec (28), and 1.34 sec (29)), but lower than that observed in a recent study in pigs (1.80 sec (30)). However, these values may also dependon the measurement technique used. Klein et al (16) and Flacke et al (28) utilized a modified Look\u2010Locker technique that is known to measure T1* (31). It is also known that blood T1 at 1.5T depends strongly on hematocrit (32), with variations between 1.1\u20132.0 seconds for Hct variations of 0.6 and 0.2. The b\u2010SSFP readout module used with our method has been shown to be less sensitive to saturation effects than spoiled gradient\u2010echo techniques (e.g., fast low\u2010angle shot (FLASH)) due to the refocusing and reuse of transverse magnetization, which makes the sampling of free Mz recovery more accurate in IR experiments (33). This is because the decay rate of magnetization during b\u2010SSFP readout (E1*) is slower than that for FLASH (24, 28, 34). Because of this transient decay rate, the continuous sampling of the T1 relaxation curve using either b\u2010SSFP or FLASH requires appropriate correction of the measured T1 relaxation time, with more significant corrections needed when FLASH is used. Since our technique sampled T1 with discrete TIs using (relatively) short readout times, the majority of the signal intensity at ky = 0 evolved from the free IR preceding data acquisition, and thus the measured T1 was an accurate estimation of the true T1. Even so, the accuracy is a function of the applied flip angle and the number of excitations used during data acquisition, especially if a simplistic recovery expression like Eq. [3] is used to map signal intensities to T1. It can be shown (by using the full b\u2010SSFP expression (35)) that the error in estimation of T1 using IRss is relatively minor (<7%) over flip angles of 10\u201390\u00b0 (assuming T1myo = 1100 msec, T2myo = 50 msec, T1blood = 1500 msec, T2blood = 250 msec). Furthermore, this measurement technique was assessed on phantoms of varying T1 values and resulted in accurate measurements compared to reference T1 values.",

The calculation of T1 maps using the 2pt\u2010IR method is limited by possible misregistration of the source images, which may cause erroneous measurements near tissue interfaces. This can be attributed to blurring from insufficient breath\u2010holding, or acquisitions during different phases of the cardiac cycle. Erroneous T1 measurements due to misregistration become significant if the technique is extended to individuals with small subendocardial infarcts. In this case, manually placed ROIs on the source images may be ideal.",

Some subjects revealed a marked T1 change between fields (+0.15 sec), whereas others experienced only a subtle change at the same time point (\u223c0.06 sec). As a result, when data at each time point were analyzed cumulatively, there was no significant difference in blood and myocardium postcontrast T1 between 1.5T and 3T (Table 2). This observation reveals that the change in T1 seen prior to contrast administration is obscured following injection, possibly as a result of different contrast kinetic behavior among subjects, or a substantial T2* dephasing effect at 3T during T1 measurement. The former may be attributed to differences in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), left ventricular ejection fraction, or extracellular volumes among the subjects, while the latter may be due to field inhomogeneities and susceptibility effects. Although imaging procedures were implemented to reduce T2* dephasing (short TE), and the dose was identical at both field strengths, it is possible that the concentration of the contrast agent in circulation at any given time point was not the same during both study sessions. A difference in Gd\u2010DTPA\u2010BMA concentration among studies may be related to day\u2010to\u2010day changes in GFR that are largely controlled by food or fluid intake. Large differences in GFR among humans and dogs (37, 38) and over day\u2010to\u2010day periods (38) were recently observed. This degree of variation in postcontrast T1 measurements in vivo was also observed in previous studies (15, 16).",

These previous reports assumed that \u03bbmyo = \u0394R\n1myo/\u0394R\n1blood (t), which implies r1myo/r1blood = 1 (Eq. [2]). However, in the present study, there was an observable difference in \u0394R\n1myo/\u0394R\n1blood (t) between 1.5T and 3T, which (from Eq. [2]) suggests there may be some tissue and field dependency of Gd\u2010DTPA\u2010BMA relaxivity (r\n1). Previous investigations that directly quantified Gd\u2010DTPA relaxivity reported marginal decreases in r\n1 in vivo and in vitro at high field strengths (39, 40, 41). Since explicit contrast agent concentrations were not determined in the present study, the relaxivity of Gd\u2010DTPA\u2010BMA in blood and myocardium (r\n1blood and r\n1myo, respectively) could not be directly calculated using serial R1 measurements (Eq. [1]). The ratio of compartmental relaxivities (r\n1myo/r\n1blood(t)) is only valid under the conditions of contrast agent steady state, which was confirmed by a constant value for \u0394R\n1myo/\u0394R\n1blood (t) over time. Even though Fig. 3 demonstrates this constancy at both 1.5T and 3T, it is apparent that a difference exists for this measure between the two field strengths (P < 0.10). Using approximate values of fECV = 0.35 and Hct = 0.40 (15), \u03bbmyo = fECV/(1 \u2212 Hct) \u2248 0.58 in Eq. [2], making r\n1myo/r\n1blood approximately 0.80 at 1.5T and 0.93 at 3T. It can be inferred from these data, therefore, that the relaxivity of Gd\u2010DTPA\u2010BMA may be greater in blood than in myocardium (r\n1myo/r\n1blood(t) < 1). Similarly, using Eq. [1], the ratio of \u0394R\n1(t) between 1.5T and 3T can be determined in the same individual for either blood or myocardium to reveal the field dependence of r\n1: \u0394R1(t)1.5T/\u0394R1(t)3T=r1.5T/r3T. It can be shown with this equation that r\n1.5T/r\n3T is 1.18 \u00b1 0.15 in blood and 1.01 \u00b1 0.10 in myocardium, implying that the relaxivity in blood may decrease with field strength (r\n1.5T/r\n3T > 1) while the relaxivity in myocardium remains constant. However, because of the broad range of measured myocardial extracellular volumes (0.25\u20130.40 (5, 15, 16, 42)), there will be uncertainty in generalizing r\n1myo/r\n1blood and r\n1.5T/r\n3T without precise measurements of Hct or \u03bbmyo.",

Thus, for imaging sequences that rely on preparation pulses, such as inversion and saturation recovery, it is simpler to suppress longer T1s because the slope of magnetization recovery becomes shallower as it crosses or originates from zero, allowing some leeway in TI selection. However, this may also decrease image contrast if the other tissue of interest is also suppressed. Our results suggest that the possible decrease in blood r\n1 seen at 3T would produce lower image contrast between blood and myocardium postcontrast at 3T relative to 1.5T. This may have significance in delayed enhancement imaging at 3T, since image contrast will likely decrease between blood and normal myocardium after normal myocardium is suppressed using IR. However, this may benefit image contrast between enhanced infarct tissue and blood for delineating subendocardial infarcts. Unfortunately, predictions can not be made at this time about the field\u2010dependent behavior of contrast\u2010enhanced infarct tissue.",
