First, the overarching relevant policies and guidelines from WHO and CDC were located, as they are often used as a blueprint in many countries for policy and guideline development. The IPC39 and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS)40 located within the WHO websites were searched using a subject search with the key words \u201cinfection control.\u201d A total of 128 articles were found of which 28 were selected in accordance with the focus areas and selected language, that is, English. Articles in Bangladeshi, Indonesian, or Korean were not available on the IRIS. Available languages given in the IRIS were Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. As for the CDC guidelines, the \u201cGuideline Library\u201d from the CDC website was used to locate relevant guidelines. Second, policies and guidelines from 4 western countries (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia) were searched so that comparisons could be made with the 3 target countries. A grey literature search was undertaken over 2 months, November and December 2018, using the Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search. A specific search of the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country was also conducted between December 2018 and January 2019. Third, key personal contacts in each of the target countries were consulted to ensure that nothing was missed in our search. Key personal contacts in selected countries includes currently practicing health care professionals in acute care facilities, an IPC professional, and a senior researcher in the IPC field. Google translator was also used to translate the documents. The translated documents were then reviewed for accuracy by the key personal contacts in the selected countries, as well as by 2 of the authors who are native in Korean and Indonesian, respectively. The first author was responsible for the search, translation, and reviewing policies in Korean. Finally, using the same search terms that were adopted for the grey literature search (outlined later), a key word search was undertaken using databases related to the field of public health, health policy, communicable diseases, health care, nursing and allied health, and social science: Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, Proquest databases, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus to look for relevant recommendations and information regarding family caregivers\u2019 involvement in the IPC strategies in the published peer review journals.",

Patients families are addressed as a passive observer of hand hygiene rather than active participants. Although partnerships with the patient and their family in hand hygiene strategies are addressed, as well as patient empowerment programs, the ultimate purpose is to increase hand hygiene compliance among HCWs through patient empowerment.125 This perspectives toward HCWs being the primary actors in the acute care facility is reflected throughout the guidelines from WHO,42\n,\n46\n,\n48\n,\n49\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n56\n,\n58\n,\n65 CDC,71\n,\n77 United Kingdom,106\n,\n110\n,\n111 and Canada,25\n,\n99\n,\n101, 102, 103 and it was noted in the pilot study performed in Bangladesh prior to the implementation of the WHO hand hygiene guideline.56 Bangladesh was one of the pilot sites for the implementation of the WHO hand hygiene guideline. Despite the in-depth involvement of family caregivers in the inpatient care,1\n,\n32 hand hygiene compliance was only studied among HCWs in relation to the hand hygiene resources and infrastructural elements such as availability of sinks or alcohol-based handrub. Although overcrowding as well as cultural sensitivities were reported as barriers of hand hygiene implementation strategy, details of cultural consideration such as family carers in the hospital were not provided.",

This is to reduce the risk of overcrowding conditions in the patient room so that risk of HAI decreases accordingly. Therefore, nurses are to provide total care including assisting patient's activities of daily living, which were previously assisted by either family members of patients or private carers. However, owing to the combination of inadequate nursing staffing level and fundamental societal values operating within the society, total elimination of caregivers has not yet been achieved. Second, most hospitals including tertiary hospitals limit the number of carers to 1 person to stay with a patient, but still allow patients\u2019 carers to stay and assist with basic care. Therefore, the situation in relation to residing family carers remains the status quo.",

However, their recommendations seem to be formulated based on the assumption that the basic patient care is provided by HCWs in the hospital setting. Therefore, the focus of cultural consideration in the guidelines is about handwashing practices among HCWs rather than cultural influence over health care arrangements for various carers. It is important to consider direct patient care involvement of various carers as much as HCWs, patient room arrangement accommodating the alternate carers to stay and care for patients, and customs or culture that may influence the perception toward hand hygiene among the public, except HCWs.

Although high nurse-to-patient ratio and various arrangements for carers to stay in the hospital, such as a spare mattress and hospital rules, could be enough evidence of these familial carers\u2019 involvement in the inpatient care, these involvements in care are not documented in the policies or guidelines. Uncertainty in care responsibility of patient carers because of the absence of role clarity may lead to supervision and education issues. Furthermore, it may have negative implications to patient safety. Besides patient empowerment and patient engagement in the hand hygiene program, guidelines about items brought into the hospitals by patient family members or visitors are absent from Korea and Indonesia. When reviewing patient information from western countries, patients and their family members are described as a 2-separate group. For example, patients are advised to ask their family or visitors to wash their hands every time they enter the room. However, in the patient information from Korean hospitals, patients and their carers are not separately described. Patients and their family members are treated as a group, so asking questions to wash hands between them may be considered an unnecessary procedure. In fact, there is no information stating patients to ask their visitors or family carers to wash hands in the documents from the target countries. More allowance of items brought into the hospital, such as blankets for cares and food, could be understood from this perspective.",

It may be because many countries have developed their guidelines and policies with reference to the large public organizations, such as the WHO and CDC. However, when cultural values strongly influence the ways of care being delivered and the health care accommodates these cultural influences in the practice, policy and guidelines should reflect this difference. From the review, significant gaps were identified between actual practices and guidelines in the 3 selected Asian countries. Although they followed the evidence-based practice developed by global organizations, adaptation without consideration of cultural influences in health care may lead to adverse outcomes in health, that is, HAI. Findings from this review highlight the importance of developing in-depth understanding of cultural influence in health care delivery in which cultural values and belief are different from other parts of the world. Currently, limited guidelines are available in the HAI in these countries, and major gaps were identified between actual practice and guidelines. We acknowledge that our findings could not be representative of the entire Asian countries. We had to use a convenience sampling method due to limited access to obtain policies and guidelines that can only be retrieved from personal contacts. Further studies should be followed to explore guidelines and policies available in countries that share a similar culture.",
