Infectious agents can initiate autoimmune responses by mechanisms such as molecular mimicry or bystander activation (reviewed in Ref. 1 ). In addition, pathogens might also provoke relapses or worsen preexisting autoimmune pathologies. For example, common infections augment both the risk and the severity of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 2 To study the effects of a viral infection on a preexisting autoimmune background, we have combined the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and mice that express auto-antibodies to a CNS antigen. MHV A59 provokes acute encephalitis, which is followed in a proportion of the surviving mice by a demyelinating disease that shares several features with MS. 3, 4 Litzenburger and colleagues have generated transgenic mice (referred here as anti-MOG Ig mice) that constitutively express auto-antibodies specific of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). These mice show an exacerbated version of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but do not develop any spontaneous disease. 5", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 144, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 364, "end": 365, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 733, "end": 735, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 736, "end": 737, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Intracranial injection of a sublethal dose of MHV A59 resulted in an exacerbation of the clinical disease in mice with MOG-specific antibodies compared with controls ( Figure 1, A) survival test).
