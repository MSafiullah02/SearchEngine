Antibiotics, vaccines, and the molecular revolution in biology have not erased their mark. Millions of persons die every year from treatable ancient diseases, such as malaria (Gething et al. 2011; WHO 2012), tuberculosis (Dye et al. 2008), and measles (Orenstein and Hinman 2012; Simons et al. 2012). Sometimes, elimination of these diseases through vaccination, prophylaxis, and/or vector control is possible, but sustaining elimination campaigns is difficult as pathogens approach the point of elimination (Cohen et al. 2012). Conversely, emerging pathogens such as SARS and swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) cause excess mortality, disrupt business, terrorize vulnerable populations, and lead to new, sometimes ineradicable endemic diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS). The benefits of accurately forecasting disease emergence would be tremendous: in the case of a low-incidence SARS-like pathogen, the savings could be tens of billions of $US (Rossi and Walker 2005; Smith et al. 2009); an illness resembling the 1918 influenza virus might take millions of lives and impose costs of the same order as a year\u2019s gross domestic product (Osterholm 2005).",

Similar critical points occur in other complex systems (Strogatz 1994; Sole 2011). Particularly, in noisy (stochastic) systems, these critical points manifest as transitions between alternative modes of fluctuation (Scheffer 2009; Scheffer et al. 2009; Lenton 2011; Scheffer et al. 2012). We call such a stochastic transition a critical transition if there exists a bifurcation in a suitably constructed limit case of the mean field model. A central problem in the study of critical transitions is the identification of phenomena indicating the proximity to a critical transition in the absence of a detailed understanding on the system\u2019s dynamical equations and/or the forcing variables causing the change (Scheffer et al. 2009; Scheffer et al. 2012; Boettiger and Hastings 2012). Recent studies have established that some noise-induced phenomena may signal the approach to a critical transition in a slowly forced dynamical system (Ives and Dakos 2012; Dakos et al. 2012a, b; Dakos et al. 2008; Carpenter and Brock 2006; Donangelo et al. 2012; Seekell et al. 2011; Carpenter and Brock 2011; Brock and Carpenter 2010; Dakos et al. 2010; Carpenter et al. 2008; Guttal and Jayaprakash 2008, 2009).

            "text": "Many of these characteristic noise-induced phenomena involve critical slowing down, a decline in the resilience of the system to perturbations, which generally gives rise to an increase in the variance and autocorrelation of fluctuations as the system approaches the transition (van Nes and Scheffer 2007; Dakos et al. 2012a). But, these properties require that the transition be suitably regular (Hastings and Wysham 2010). Specifically, to observe critical slowing down requires that the potential function of the system, if it exists, be smooth. Also, for systems with multiple attracting sets (e.g., bistable systems), a sufficient level of noise gives rise to \u201cflickering\u201d which exhibits the characteristic increase in variance (but for a different reason) and not the increase in autocorrelation (Scheffer et al. 2009; Dakos et al. 2012b). Other obstacles to anticipating critical transitions in infectious diseases include that epidemiological systems are complicated by amplification of transients and oscillatory dynamics (Rohani et al. 2002; Bauch and Earn 2003), that infectious diseases are often seasonally forced (Altizer et al. 2006; Fraser and Grassly 2006) and propagate in demographically open systems subject to imported cases (Keeling and Rohani 2002), and that diseases that are close to elimination or close to emerging are, by definition, characterized by low prevalence and, therefore, both subject to demographic stochasticity and difficult to observe (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009). Therefore, to determine whether diagnostic noise-induced phenomena accompany the critical transitions that occur in infectious disease dynamics, namely the transition to endemicity of emerging infectious diseases and the transition to extinction in disease elimination, it will be useful to have a quantitative theory, both to guide the selection of statistical quantities to be investigated and to predict the form that observable quantities should take as the transition is approached.",

We consider the compartmental susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013susceptible (SIS) and susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) models, which are widely used to represent the dynamics of a range of nonimmunizing and immunizing pathogens and may be viewed as approximations to an even broader class of infectious diseases. In their deterministic formulations, these models are characterized by a transcritical bifurcation at \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$R_{0}=1$\\end{document}, where the endemic and disease-free steady states meet and exchange stability. The epidemic models we investigate are generalizations of the closed population SIS and SIR models that allow for immigration from external sources, of which the more familiar models without immigration that are characterized by a transcritical bifurcation are special cases. To appropriately model the slowly forced dynamical system, we first develop mean field theory for the nonstationary systems gradually approaching a bifurcation. We develop the mean field theory here because slowly forced dynamical systems approaching a bifurcation have rarely been investigated (but see Kuehn (2011)). We then develop the full stochastic description in terms of a master equation. Our strategy is to use the van Kampen system size expansion to separate the mean field dynamics from the fluctuations induced by demographic stochasticity. These fluctuations are described by a Fokker\u2013Planck equation, from which the power spectrum, variance, autocorrelation, and coefficient of variation may be analytically obtained. Our main result is contained in Table 4, which provides formulas expressing these theoretical predictions in terms of the dominant eigenvalue of the mean field solutions, which goes to zero as the system approaches the critical transition. Hence, these formulas express how epidemiologically measurable quantities are expected to change as the system approaches the critical transition. A number of approximations are introduced in the derivation of these formulas, including separation of time scales, second-order description of the fluctuations, and continuum representation of the state space. We, therefore, performed simulations to study the possible detrimental effects of these approximations. Specifically, we examined the agreement between the theoretical predictions and \u201cmeasured\u201d statistics obtained in a moving window, as one would analyze real-world data, in both discrete state-space and continuous state-space simulations. We show that the analytical expressions are robust, provided the conditions of fast\u2013slow systems are met. These results demonstrate that the critical transitions associated with disease emergence and elimination may be anticipated even in the absence of a detailed understanding of their underlying causes.",

The solution grows more slowly than the stable equilibrium. The delay in the dynamics is also exhibited by stochastic realizations, e.g., Fig. 6b. Outbreaks remain small and sporadic for at least 10 years after the bifurcation has occurred. The delay before emergence arises because the mean predicted by system (7) remains small following the bifurcation. However, the bifurcation delay is not as marked as that in the SIS model (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. 6).\n\n",

The patterns in the power spectra with immigration (Fig. 7c, d) and without (Fig. 7a, b) are similar. For SIS systems with low transmission rates, and SIR models with low recruitment rate into the susceptible class, the power in the peak of the spectrum is low. The power spectrum for SIS and SIR systems is expected to shift to lower frequencies as the pathogen approaches extinction. In the SIS systems, the power at smallest frequencies increases as the critical point is approached, but this effect is subtle. In contrast, in the SIR case, there is a dramatic reduction in the frequency at which the highest power is observed. The approach to endemicity is expected to be indicated by a shift to higher frequencies in the power spectrum. In the SIS model, the spectrum encompasses a broader range of frequencies as emergence is approached. On the other hand, in subcritical SIR systems approaching endemicity, fluctuations should become less noisy as the threshold is approached. The power spectrum transforms from a flat \u201cwhite-noise\u201d spectrum in the subcritical scenario to a spectrum exhibiting resonant peaks for sufficiently decreased vaccination uptake. Oscillations are expected to be amplified at these resonant frequencies. It has been shown that complex eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of system (6) guarantee the existence of the power spectrum peak (Alonso et al. 2007).\n\n",

For the SIR model, the approach to elimination (Figs. 11 and 12) was indicated by an increase in the autocorrelation, a decrease in the variance, and an increase in the coefficient of variation, as predicted by the theory. For the SIS and SIR models, the approach to emergence was indicated by an increase in variance, but the effects on the autocorrelation and the coefficient of variation were imperceptible (Figs. 13 and 14). Further, since the theoretical patterns may be difficult to distinguish from random noise or fail to provide a sufficiently reliable signal under realistic conditions for data collection, we also examined the suitability of these statistics as an online algorithm for early warning. Following Boettiger and Hastings (2012), we summarized the results of online analysis using the receiver operator characteristic. These results showed that the approach to elimination in both the SIS model (Fig. 10) and the SIR model (Figs. 11 and 12) could be detected with a high level of reliability (large AUC), although variance was a much poorer indicator in the SIR model than autocorrelation and the coefficient of variation. However, the approach to emergence was very difficult to detect in both the SIS model and the SIR model, with estimated AUC values hovering just above the null value of 0.5 (Figs. 13 and 14). In summary, our simulation studies show the approximations required to obtain the theoretical predictions to be acceptable but indicate that reliable prediction is likely only in the case of leading indicators for elimination, not early warning signals of emergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Particularly, our simulations illustrated the ubiquity of bifurcation delays\u2014changes in system state that lag behind the bifurcation of the limiting case\u2014during disease emergence and elimination. Delays are of fundamental interest because they provide a mechanism for the frequent realization of far-from-equilibrium situations and because they are a dramatic example of tipping point phenomena in infectious diseases. Indeed, delays can cause a system to appear to undergo a catastrophic shift (e.g., the dramatic upturn of infectious cases associated with emergence) when, in fact, only a noncatastrophic transcritical bifurcation has occurred. Our results show that two kinds of delays occur in disease emergence and elimination. The first delay is a deterministic phenomenon referred to as a canard (Diener 1984). Canards occur in fast\u2013slow systems where the solution follows an attracting slow manifold of the fast\u2013slow system, passing close to a bifurcation point, and then follows a repelling slow manifold for a considerable period of time. Thus, for instance, in Fig. 3a, which depicts the emergence of an SIS infection, the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$\\end{document} limit case branch rapidly increases close to the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\eta = 0$\\end{document} critical point, but the solution of the fast\u2013slow system (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\epsilon >0$\\end{document}) tracks the disease-free equilibrium for a noticeable amount of time even after it has become unstable. The influence that the canard has on the stochastic dynamics can be observed in Fig. 3b, where the number of infectious individuals remains in the vicinity of the precritical level for a noticeable period of time. A related phenomenon, but not so dramatic, is observed in the elimination case (Fig. 2a). Following the bifurcation, the infectious population remains elevated, but unlike the emergence case, no dramatic shift to extinction occurs. Analogous phenomena are observed in the SIR model (Figs. 5 and 6).",

This phenomenon is most obvious in the emergence of an immunizing pathogen (the emergence scenario for the SIR model). In this case, the number of infectious individuals in the population prior to the critical transition is most commonly zero. Assuming that there are no infectious individuals in the population at the time of the bifurcation event, then the number of infections in the population will remain zero until the time that an imported case arises. In view of the assumption of demographic stochasticity, importation is a Poisson process with nonzero rate parameter, which similarly ensures that a nonzero period of time must elapse before the first case appears. Indeed, even after the first case appears, there is no guarantee that the system will undergo transition, since even in a supercritical population, there is some chance of rapid extinction (Allen 2003). When the system is only slightly supercritical, this chance may not be small. For measurement purposes, we might define this stochastic bifurcation delay as the time elapsed between the occurrence of the bifurcation and the final occurrence of zero infectious individuals in the population. Clearly, this quantity is a random variable. The distributional properties of this stochastic bifurcation delay are an important problem for further research.",

In such a scenario, any introduction of infectious individuals may spark a major outbreak. In the case of disease elimination, a system may already exist in the subcritical state, with only lingering infections and short transmission chains enabling the pathogen to transiently persist. In such cases, the battle has already been won, but it is crucial that vaccination campaigns and other elimination activities be continued until the remaining lines of transmission are snuffed out. Otherwise, gains that may have come at great cost will fail to be maintained, and the pathogen may resurge in the population, sparked by its own embers still smoldering in the face of relaxed intervention. The development of statistical methods to identify such situations is an urgent problem for further research.",

The magnitude of the real part of the eigenvalue, which approximates the rate of decay of the amplitude of the oscillations to the equilibrium, decreases as elimination is approached, but, near the threshold, the magnitude of the real part begins to increase once more, indicating a shorter return time to equilibrium and increased resistance of the system to perturbations, as the spiral begins to resemble a node. This subsequent decline in system memory is reflected in the decrease in the autocorrelation function near the critical point. The more rapid decay of the oscillations is also reflected in the power spectrum, in that the the spectrum peak declines as vaccination uptake increases, meaning that the resonant frequencies become less amplified. On the other hand, the recovery rate of the stable spiral in the limiting case decreases much more dramatically on the transition to elimination, and oscillations at the resonant frequencies become more amplified. Thus, while the limiting case is an important guide in understanding more general disease models, it is also necessary to thoroughly investigate these models to understand the behavior of systems approaching a critical transition.",

            "text": "This study has followed Kuehn (2011) and Boettiger and Hastings (2012) in the use of stochastic differential equations to understand noise-induced phenomena that occur during a critical transition. It is understood, of course, that for discrete systems (such as infectious disease transmission), this continuum representation is only an approximation, and, moreover, that the approximation breaks down as the system size\u2014or even if the size of just one important compartment\u2014becomes small. The case of disease emergence, where the number of infectious individuals in a population prior to the critical transition is typically zero and only occasionally one or more, is precisely this situation. It would not be surprising, therefore, to discover the approach taken in this paper to perform poorly in this situation. But, this is not the case. As Figs. 13 and 14 show, in both the SIS and SIR systems, the \u201cmeasured\u201d statistics obtained in simulation are qualitatively similar to the analytic expressions reported in Table 4, with the exception of the coefficient of variation in the SIR model. We note, further, that although emergence was difficult to predict (AUC values were not much greater than 0.5), the van Kampen detrending, which we think of as the theory-dependent approach, typically performed better than generic Gaussian detrending, which may be computed without any theoretical assumptions. It is, nevertheless, a concern that the approach taken here will be misleading under some scenarios: for instance, a very slow approach to the critical transition, when the time between immigration events may be large and the van Kampen approximation is likely to break down. Moreover, the stochastic features of bifurcation delay, particularly important in the emergence scenarios, depend heavily on (a) the sequence of immigration events by infectious individuals, and (b) the probability of nonextinction for a transmission chain initiated by an infectious individual after the critical point has been passed. These are both intrinsically discrete aspects of the emergence process. For this reason, we suggest that the study of (nonstationary) discrete transmission models may be a fruitful direction for further study. There is, of course, a large body of work on (stationary) discrete contagion models on which such a theory could build (Bailey 1964; Renshaw 1991; Daley and Gani 1999; Allen 2003).",

The variance in the SIR case is predicted to decline, which is not unexpected here, but does not conform to standard expectations. The coefficient of variation increases as the critical point is approached, but the increase is not as dramatic as one may expect from the limiting case. In contrast to expectations, the lag-1 autocorrelation is predicted to decline close to the critical point if \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\eta >0$\\end{document}.
