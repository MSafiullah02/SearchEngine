The health care system is being challenged in the United States and 3 worldwide, and the general public is scared and concerned. Yet through all this, families will 4 continue to give birth and bring new life into the world. As health care providers, we could use 5 this current pandemic and a means to educate the public about the importance of human milk and 6 breastfeeding as lifesaving medical interventions. The purpose of this editorial is to provide 7 guidance regarding breastfeeding and COVID-19 and reaffirm why it is of paramount 8 importance to promote and protect the use of human milk and breastfeeding. La Leche League International (LLLI) further recommended that if someone who is 30 breastfeeding becomes ill, it is important not to interrupt direct breastfeeding (2020). In such as 31 case, the infant was already exposed to the virus by the mother and/or family and will benefit 32 most from continued direct breastfeeding (LLLI, 2020). Disruption of breastfeeding will increase the risk of the infant becoming ill because of the lack of immune support (LLLI, 2020). If any 34 member of the family has been exposed, the infant has been exposed. Hence, interruption of 35 breastfeeding may actually increase the risk of the infant becoming ill (LLLI, 2020) . public health crisis that we can address by changing the current care paradigm (Spatz, in press).",

There is a critical window to effectively establish lactation to 60 ensure copious milk supply long term (Spatz, 2020).
