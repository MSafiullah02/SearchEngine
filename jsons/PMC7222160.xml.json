It is characterized by acute and refractory hypoxemia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar damage, and reduced compliance (or increased lung stiffness) (ARDS Definition Task Force et al. 2012) (Fig. 1). Despite advances in the understanding of ARDS pathophysiology and development of supportive care approaches, such as protective mechanical ventilation, antibiotic and fluid therapies, sedation management, prone positioning, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), it remains a devastating, life-threatening disorder associated with a high mortality rate (ranging from 35 to 60% depending on underlying disease severity) (Bellani et al. 2016; M\u00e1ca et al. 2017; Papazian et al. 2019). Furthermore, those patients who survive usually face long-term morbidity, which significantly impairs their quality of life (Biehl et al. 2015).",

In 2006, the International Society for Cellular Therapy stablished minimal criteria to define MSCs: (1) they must be plastic-adherent under standard culture conditions; (2) they must express certain cell surface epitopes, such as CD73, CD90, and CD105, and must lack expression of CD11b or CD14, CD34, CD45, CD79, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR; and (3) they must be able to differentiate into adipocytes, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts in vitro (Dominici et al. 2006). To date, it is known that MSCs can be obtained not only from bone marrow but also from several other tissue sources, including adipose tissue, lung tissue, umbilical cord, and menstrual blood. Furthermore, heterogeneities in gene expression and stability, secretome, and cell surface proteins have been observed in MSCs from different sources, which might impact on their immunomodulatory actions (Ostanin et al. 2011; Nora et al. 2012; Elahi et al. 2016; Heo et al. 2016; Silva et al. 2018a).",

They have lower tumorigenic potential than embryonic stem cells and can be rapidly expanded ex vivo, which enables their clinical use in single- or multiple-dose regimens (Weiss et al. 2011). MSCs also exert immunomodulatory actions without the need for host-recipient matching, thus allowing their use in either autologous or allogeneic transplantation. MSCs exhibit low expression of HLA type I; HLA type II exists intracellularly but is absent on the cell surface. When cells are preconditioned with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, HLA type II can traffic to the cell surface, but MSCs still evade recognition by alloreactive T cells (Le Blanc et al. 2003). Finally, MSCs can detect specifically injured environments and tailor their responses accordingly, which provides an advantage for their use in many diseases (Mathieu and Loboa 2012; Galleu et al. 2017; Leuning et al. 2018; de Castro et al. 2019; Islam et al. 2019).",

Some postulated mechanisms include cell contact-dependent actions and secretion of paracrine or endocrine factors, which act on nearby cells or travel through the blood to exert their effects. Regardless of whether by contact-dependent or contact-independent mechanisms, MSC administration has been shown to result in anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, enhanced epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, and, ultimately, reductions in multiple organ injury and mortality (Fig. 2). Notably, although many experimental studies have used vehicle (regular saline or phosphate-buffered saline) as a negative control, no therapeutic benefits were observed when fibroblasts were used as a negative control cell population, indicating that only MSCs have the ability to induce such therapeutic benefits (McIntyre et al. 2016).",

Administration of MSCs either intratracheally or intravenously has been demonstrated to mitigate inflammation by reducing levels of several inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, MIP-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, while also increasing levels of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution factors, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN), IL-10, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and TNF-inducible gene (TSG)-6. Such findings were observed in lung tissue homogenates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and distal organs in distinct models of experimental ARDS (Table 2). A transcription network analysis also revealed that MSC administration may induce downregulation of endotoxin/toll-like receptor (TLR)-innate immune pro-inflammatory responses, while upregulating nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)-related genes, which indicates a shift from innate to adaptive immune responses (dos Santos et al. 2012). Importantly, the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs have been mostly attributed to paracrine/endocrine mechanisms, as few to no donor-derived cells localize at the host lung tissue after MSC therapy, and MSC-conditioned media has also been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory mediator levels and cell counts in many ARDS models. In this line, certain therapeutic benefits induced by MSCs have been correlated to their ability to produce extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are membrane vesicles ubiquitously secreted by cells. EVs can carry small, messenger, and other RNAs, as well as proteins, lipids, and organelles, which can alter gene expression and modulate the behavior of target cells (Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-M\u00f3 et al. 2015).",

            "text": "MSCs can induce upregulation of TSG-6, a potent anti-inflammatory mediator that inhibits neutrophilia by suppressing CXCL8-mediated chemotaxis (Danchuk et al. 2011; Dyer et al. 2014). In a model of zymosan-induced peritonitis, macrophage-produced TNF-\u03b1 stimulated MSCs to produce TSG-6, which acted as a negative feedback loop on macrophage inflammatory signaling (Choi et al. 2011). Knockdown of TSG-6 expression in MSCs has demonstrated to abrogate several anti-inflammatory actions of MSC therapy in experimental models of endotoxin-induced lung injury (Danchuk et al. 2011). MSCs also reduced tissue injury by inhibiting formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (Pedrazza et al. 2017). Furthermore, MSC therapy can induce production of IL-1RN to protect lung tissue against bleomycin-induced injury by blocking the production and/or activity of IL-1\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 (Ortiz et al. 2007). Repeated administration of cell therapy also prevented disease progression by mitigating expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-1R1, while enhancing expression of IL-1RN, in experimental silicosis-induced lung injury (Lopes-Pacheco et al. 2013).",

            "text": "When exposed to endotoxin or TNF-\u03b1, MSCs increased production of PGE2, which induced resident macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and increased production of IL-10 (N\u00e9meth et al. 2009). In this context, enhanced production of IL-10 has been correlated with inhibition of rolling, adhesion, and transmigration of neutrophils (N\u00e9meth et al. 2009) and suppression of effector T cell proliferation (Chen et al. 2014), while inducing regulatory T cell expansion (Sun et al. 2011; Chao et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2019) and reprogramming other macrophages into the M2 phenotype (N\u00e9meth et al. 2009; Vasandan et al. 2016). Although several studies have indicated an increase in IL-10 levels after MSC therapy, others have demonstrated a reduction in the inflammatory process with no change (Gupta et al. 2012; Krasnodembskaya et al. 2012) or even a decrease in IL-10 levels (Mei et al. 2010; Sep\u00falveda et al. 2014). Similarly, variable effects have been observed regarding IFN-\u03b3 levels, with studies reporting reduction (Gonzalez-Rey et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2011; C\u00f3ndor et al. 2016), no change (N\u00e9meth et al. 2009; Pedrazza et al. 2014), or even an increase (Wang et al. 2015). In fact, there are several differences among these experimental studies that can explain such heterogeneity: (1) disease severity, etiology, and initial insult; (2) MSC dose, source, and route of administration; (3) timing of therapy (prophylactic or therapeutic) and analysis methods. Although the underlying mechanisms and degree of therapeutic benefit obtained may differ, in most cases, MSCs were nevertheless able to efficiently induce anti-inflammatory effects.",

Although the mechanisms by which MSC therapy exert anti-apoptotic effects need to be further investigated, MSCs have demonstrated ability to reduce apoptotic cell counts in the lung and distal organs (Pedrazza et al. 2014; Xiang et al. 2017; Silva et al. 2018a; Zhang et al. 2018). MSCs have also been shown to protect alveolar macrophages from endotoxin-induced apoptosis partially by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway (Li et al. 2015). Increased secretion of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) after MSC therapy was demonstrated to decrease monocyte apoptosis by protein kinase B phosphorylation (Lee et al. 2013). Furthermore, either MSCs or their conditioned media can protect resting and activated neutrophils in vitro from undergoing apoptosis by cell contact-independent mechanisms (Raffaghello et al. 2008). Several studies have also demonstrated that MSC therapy mitigates TNF-\u03b1 levels (Kim et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2013; G\u00fcldner et al. 2015), which might contribute to its anti-apoptotic effects, as TNF-\u03b1 can induce cell death by activating the Fas/FasL pathway.",

Such effects appeared to be mediated by secretion of antimicrobial peptides, including LL-37 (Krasnodembskaya et al. 2010) and lipocalin-2 (Gupta et al. 2012), since antimicrobial actions were abrogated when neutralizing antibodies were used. Secretion of \u03b2-defensin-2 via TLR4 signaling has also been implicated in MSC-induced bacterial clearance (Sung et al. 2016). Furthermore, MSCs have been shown to reduce bacterial load in vivo by enhancing the phagocytic activity of macrophages (Mei et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2013) and monocytes (Krasnodembskaya et al. 2012). In both in vivo and in vitro models, MSCs also enhanced phagocytic activity of macrophages and monocytes by promoting mitochondrial transfer via tunneling nanotubes, thus resulting in a more effective bacterial clearance (Jackson et al. 2016).",

MSC therapy also reduced lung endothelial cell permeability in ex vivo perfused human lungs injured by either endotoxin or live E. coli, while inhibiting neutrophil influx and enhancing production of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-7 (Lee et al. 2009a, 2013). Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that MSCs were able to mobilize adherens and tight junction proteins and reduce the binding of inflammatory cells to the endothelium, resulting in preservation of vascular endothelial integrity (Pati et al. 2011b). Controversies persist regarding the impact of MSC therapy on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Some studies have reported a reduction in VEGF levels after MSC administration when comparing treated vs. untreated injured groups (Lee et al. 2010; Silva et al. 2018a), while other authors have observed an increase (Chang et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018a). Further research is needed to better understand the role of VEGF after MSC administration, as it has been correlated with increased vascular endothelial permeability (Lee et al. 2010), angiogenesis and wound healing (Chang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2018a), and protection of lung vascular endothelium against apoptosis (Yang et al. 2016).",

Furthermore, experimental ARDS has been shown to modify the profile of the bone marrow cell population, affecting their immunomodulatory effects and limiting their potential use for autologous transplantation (Silva et al. 2014; Antebi et al. 2018). MSCs from different sources have been intensively investigated, as these cells exhibit differences in gene expression and stability, secretome, and cell surface proteins, which may impact on their survival and regenerative properties (Ostanin et al. 2011; Nora et al. 2012; Elahi et al. 2016; Heo et al. 2016). However, few studies have comparatively evaluated the effects of MSCs from different sources (Nystedt et al. 2013; Chao et al. 2014; Silva et al. 2018a), and whether cells from any one source may provide superior therapeutic responses remains unclear. In addition, cell dosing has meaningful clinical relevance and remains under-investigated, as clinical trials conducted to date have focused on safety, with efficacy as a secondary assessment. MSCs have been administered as a single dose ranging from 5 \u00d7 104 to 3.6 \u00d7 107 cells in experimental models (McIntyre et al. 2016). From a translational perspective, this range in a 25-g mouse would correspond to 2 \u00d7 106 to 1.44 \u00d7 109 cells kg\u22121 (or 150 million to 108 billion cells for a 75-kg human). Such quantities are technically and operationally challenging, and administration of high doses of MSCs is associated with several safety concerns. To date, 1 \u00d7 107 cells kg\u22121 is the highest dose ever used in clinical studies. As in pharmacological research, determination of the therapeutic window and index for MSC therapies is a critical step that should be further characterized in experimental studies to ensure that the greatest therapeutic benefits can be achieved without resulting in side effects in the clinical setting.",

            "text": "MSC administration has been performed by either local or systemic routes in different experimental models. While local administration (e.g., intratracheal) delivers cells directly to the site of injury, systemic administration (e.g., intravenous) allows wide distribution throughout the body. However, MSCs administered intravenously are subjected to the pulmonary first-pass effect (Fischer et al. 2009), which results in significant retention of cells. In fact, this effect may offer an advantage for lung tissue repair. Although ongoing clinical trials and most number of experimental studies have used the intravenous route (McIntyre et al. 2016), therapeutic responses were similar in the few studies that compared different routes for MSC delivery in animal models (Curley et al. 2013; Alcayaga-Miranda et al. 2015; Devaney et al. 2015). Importantly, ECMO has become an increasingly common therapeutic modality for patients with severe ARDS (Bellani et al. 2016; Papazian et al. 2019). In an ex vivo model, MSCs administered intravascularly were found to adhere to membrane oxygenator fibers during ECMO, resulting in a significant reduction of flow through the circuit (Millar et al. 2019). Further investigations should be performed with alternative routes of administration, such as intrabronchial, to identify which would be a viable option for this clinical situation. Finally, most experimental studies have focused on short-term effects of MSC therapy; evaluation of long-term effects has been comparatively neglected. Although a single dose of MSCs has been shown to result in therapeutic responses, more than one dose may be required to induce a more efficient tissue repair or even to maintain benefits, as observed in animal models of elastase-induced emphysema and silicosis (Lopes-Pacheco et al. 2013; Poggio et al. 2018).",

Under hypoxic conditions, MSCs have been shown to upregulate expression of genes related to pro-survival, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant signaling, resulting in reduction of fibrosis and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in a model of bleomycin-induced lung injury (Lan et al. 2015). In experimental sepsis, MSC preconditioning with poly (I:C), a TLR3 ligand, inhibited expression of miR-143 and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2, resulting in increased PGE2 production and macrophage anti-inflammatory actions (Zhao et al. 2014). Compared to na\u00efve MSCs, eicosapentaenoic acid-preconditioned MSCs induced further reduction in lung inflammation and remodeling as well as in lung and distal organ injury, thus resulting in greater improvement in severity score and survival in CLP-induced experimental sepsis (Silva et al. 2019b). Other studies have also demonstrated enhancement of therapeutic effects by inducing overexpression of certain genes by MSCs, including Ang-1 (Mei et al. 2007), IL-33 antagonist soluble IL-1R1 (Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2013), IL-10 (Wang et al. 2018b; Jerkic et al. 2019), Nrf2 (Zhang et al. 2018), and HGF (Meng et al. 2019). As the degree of therapeutic outcomes can differ depending on disease severity, etiology, and primary insult, different preconditioning approaches may provide a more appropriate MSC therapy according to the disease features of each patient, thus driving more effective therapeutic and regenerative responses.",

Therefore, the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy has yet to be demonstrated in large-scale clinical trials. Furthermore, if they ever prove to be an efficient therapy, MSCs must still be available within few hours, in enough quantity, and obtained in an affordable manner from a well-regulated and controlled production process if they are to become a viable therapy for patients with acute or critical illnesses, including ARDS (Ginty et al. 2011). Several barriers in the process of standardization, scalability, manufacturing, distribution, cost, and regulation, which still preclude the efficient, routine use of MSC therapy, have been discussed elsewhere (Heathman et al. 2015; Isasi et al. 2016).",

            "text": "MSC-based therapies constitute promising strategies for the treatment of ARDS, given their demonstrated therapeutic benefits: anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, enhanced epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, and improvements in lung and distal organ injury and survival. The benefits of MSC-based therapies appeared to be induced by complex, well-orchestrated signaling pathways rather than by any one (or few) mechanisms. Key mechanisms of action include secretion of paracrine and endocrine factors as well as transfer of cellular contents via extracellular vesicles or cell-to-cell contact. Despite the progress reviewed herein, many questions have yet to be answered before the therapeutic impact of MSCs can be maximized. The possibility of enhancing the benefits of MSCs by preconditioning methods has brought novel opportunities that should be further explored. Safety results from phase I and II clinical trials are encouraging, but the safety and efficacy profile has yet to be proven in large-scale trials. In an ideal clinical scenario, MSCs would be promptly available and obtained through well-standardized procedures, but some barriers still pose challenges to the feasibility of MSC therapy.",
