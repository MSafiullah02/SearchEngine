He had become ill on February 29, 2020, a total of 4 days after he had flown to Cali from Madrid, Spain, on March 2, 2020, where he was living since January 7, 2020. He began self-medication with acetaminophen on March 3, 2020. After his arrival at the Cali airport, he travelled by car to Buga, where he stayed until admission to our hospital. He denied contact in Spain with people presenting respiratory symptoms. At the hospital, he was strictly isolated.

Gastrointestinal responses, such as vomiting and diarrhoea, are the most common adverse effects of these two drugs, but in our case, he did not present them [39, 40]. The current evidence suggesting the use of chloroquine, as we did, is only based on in vitro studies. At the moment, multiple randomized controlled trials are being conducted to test the effect of chloroquine in treating COVID-19 [41]. Nowadays, The effective concentrations (EC90) of chloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells is 6.90 \u03bcM [15], which is clinically achievable, well-tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and potentially applicable to COVID-19 patients, as we did. Our patient received 5 days of chloroquine per 5 days at 600 mg per day (divided into two doses, 300 mg/day base). That is the dose recommended by different interim guidelines [42]. According to a consensus statement from a multicenter collaboration group in China, chloroquine phosphate 500-mg twice daily in tablet form for 10 days may be considered in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [43, 44]. Although optimal dosing and duration of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, its use is being reported in different COVID-19 cases, as monotherapy or combined [7, 8, 15\u201320, 39\u201341, 43]. A recent structural and molecular modeling study showed that chloroquine binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity, and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Then, the identification of this new mechanism of action of chloroquine supports its potential use the SARS-CoV-2 infection [45].",

Clarithromycin has a longer serum half-life and better tissue penetration than erythromycin, allowing twice-a-day dosing for most common infections [46]. In addition to common bacteria, azithromycin and clarithromycin have demonstrated to be also active against some unexpected pathogens (e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycobacterium avium complex, and M. leprae), and maybe also for SARS-CoV-2 [46]. The efficacy of clarithromycin has been examined against H5N1 highly pathogenic and H7N9 low pathogenic avian influenza virus infections in cynomolgus monkeys, showing viral suppression and clinical improvement [51]. A study assessed the efficacy and safety of a clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination for the treatment of serious influenza, also showing good results, reducing both 30- and 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay [52]. Then, the antiviral activity and clinical studies with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or clarithromycin, as monotherapy or especially in combination, should be specially assessed in the immediate future.",
