Since chest CT-scans are crucial for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients [1], our activity as radiologists has changed drastically with the number of non-enhanced chest tomodensitometry increasing significantly [2]. Pulmonary manifestations are now widely described but few relate about abdominal and thromboembolic complications apart from pulmonary embolism. We report the imaging features of simultaneous arterial and venous thrombosis in a 79-year-old patient affected by COVID-19 induced pneumonia.",

Initially the patient was hemodynamically stable (Blood pressure: 168/89mmHg), showed symptoms of acute respiratory insufficiency with polypnea (22 cycles per minutes with 86% of blood oxygen saturation in ambient air) and tachycardia (100bpm). Blood tests revealed C-reactive protein (125mg/L) increase and a hyperleukocytosis (12 600/mm3) with lymphopenia. Blood gas analysis showed compensated lactic acidosis (pH 7,43 with hyperlactatemia: 5,36 mmol/L). Nasopharynx PCR was negative for SARS-CoV-2.",

The upper abdominal slices showed a spontaneous hyperdensity (71 Hounsfied units (HU) vs 38 HU in the portal vein) in the right portal vein (Fig. 2\na, 4b). Further examination with enhanced CT-Scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at the arterial and portal phases, performed at the same time, confirmed a right-portal vein thrombosis (Fig. 2b) originating from thrombosis of the distal part of the upper mesenteric vein extended to the spleno-mesaraic trunk. A proximal thrombosis of the upper mesenteric artery (Fig. 3\na-b) and jejunal artery were also observed with subsequent features of bowel ischemia of the caecum and small intestine (Fig. 4\na-b) with small amount of liquid in the peritoneal cavity. No pulmonary embolism was revealed. Laparotomy was undertaken few hours later and confirmed ischemia, where a meter of necrotic ileum and right colon were removed. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the upper mesenteric artery were also performed during the same procedure. Despite timely treatment, his medical condition stayed precarious because of extended bowel ischemia in addition to severe lung damage caused by COVID-19. Palliative cares was implemented and the patient passed away 4 days later.",
