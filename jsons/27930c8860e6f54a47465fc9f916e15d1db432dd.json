In living tissues, it grows surrounded by a 3D microenvironment, which provides physical support and determines disease progression and prognosis. The aim of this project was to determine how different melanoma cell lines M14 and SK-MEL-28 behave, grow and expand in 3D in vitro models using collagen-based scaffolds. Collagen scaffolds contained either chondroitin to mimic skin tissue, hyaluronic acid or nano-hydroxyapatite to mimic bone tissue. All tested scaffolds were populated with melanoma M14 and SK-MEL-28 cells that were left to grow for 28 days. Scaffold infiltrations by cells were assessed on day 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Populated scaffolds were then processed with a tissue processor, embedded in paraffin wax, sliced up with a microtome and stained with H&E followed by bright field microscopy. The images were put together in chronological order to see the growth progression. Both SK-MEL-28 and M14 cell lines have demonstrated most penetration when grown on chondroitin scaffolds, followed by hyaluronic acid scaffolds. Cells grown on nano-hydroxyapatite scaffolds showed the least colonisation and tended to accumulate around the edges of the scaffold. M14 cells growing on chondroitin scaffolds demonstrated rapid infiltration when compared with SK-MEL28 cells probably due to intrinsic aggressive growth properties.",

Our group has shown that \u03b1-DG and likely other components of the dystrophin complex are expressed on the platelet surface. Targeting the dystroglycan complex by blocking \u03b1-DG inhibits platelet adhesion, aggregation, and thrombus formation, possibly through formation of a \u03b1-DG-fibronectin-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex. Proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation of \u03b1-DG modulate its adhesion to laminin and fibronectin in ECM. However, how these post-translational modifications respond and contribute to platelet activation, adhesion and aggregation have never been investigated. Methods Whole blood from mice or venous blood from healthy adult volunteers were centrifuged and the top 2/3 of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was collected. PRP was activated with 1 U/ml thrombin or left unactivated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C.

Recent times have shown an increased interest in replacing Mannitol with HTS as the first-line drug. Individual trials comparing the two show certain discrepancies in the results and this meta-analysis aims at eliminating the same. Methods PubMed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, MeSH, and Embase databases were searched until 8 th Feb 2019. RCTs and prospective studies, following the PRISMA guidelines and inclusion criteria where Mannitol or HTS were administered for increased ICP in STBI (Glasgow Coma Scale: 3-8) were included. The primary outcome was the change in ICP 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after drug administration. For the measurement of treatment effect RevMan 5.3 version software by Cochrane Database was utilized to calculate Odd's ratio. A Random and Fixed effect model was applied to calculate the standardised mean difference of change between groups. P value less than 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant value. The I 2 was used to measure the heterogeneity between studies and a value > 30.0 was considered to reflect heterogeneity. Results A total of 8 studies with 276 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean ICP reduction after 30 minutes of drug administration in HTS group was 7.69\u00b13.18(95%CI=4.7508-10.6464) and for mannitol group was 6.28\u00b1 4.92(95%CI=1.7291-10.8452). Test for heterogeneity, I 2 =0.00%, p=0.9380. The mean ICP reduction after 120 minutes of drug administration in HTS group was 8.31\u00b12.91(95%CI=5.62-11) and for mannitol group was 7.22\u00b1 3.74(95%CI=2.57-11.87).

However, inappropriate HIF activation promotes tumour formation and alters immunity. Whether HIF-2a, the main driver for solid-organ tumours, is regulated distinctly from HIF-1a, the constitutively expressed form, is debated. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide forward genetic screens to identify regulators of HIF-2a turnover in normoxia. Methods Ten genes were identified for validation from this HIF-2a activation screen. Genetic depletion of known HIF regulators (VHL, PHD2, and OGDH), or chemical inhibition of the HIF-2a degradation pathway, activated HIF-2a as expected. Three CRISPR sgRNAs, for each candidate gene, were designed and lentivirally transduced into HIF-2a GFP reporter cells. GFP fluorescence was monitored by flow cytometry, and immunoblotting was performed for the endogenous proteins. As a complimentary validation strategy, the HIF-2a activation screen was optimised and repeated.",

Excluding those with low patient numbers such as case reports, papers that did not include outcomes and papers where targeted radionuclide therapy (not 177 Lu-PSMA therapy) were used, yielded 26 papers. Number of patients, dosage schedule, follow-up/outcome measures and side effects were recorded for each study.",

Methods Beaumont's current virtual clinic is being used by the general surgery department to assess a select group of patients post operatively & post endoscopy, in order to assess their general health and scar healing. The end goal is to expand this service to a variety of other departments within the hospital . In order to do this it must first be demonstrated that utilisation of the virtual clinic is more efficient, cost effective and less time consuming for both healthcare providers and patients. Our main objective will be to assess patients' attitudes regarding the concept of a virtual clinic, whether or not they would be comfortable with this form of care, and whether they believe the same outcome can be achieved in this setting as compared to more traditional settings. To obtain the following information surveys were handed to patients (n=100)in the general surgery outpatient department (OPD) of Beaumont Hospital.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the aetiology and outcome patients with HIBI admitted to a National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) over a 10-year period. Methods Retrospective analysis of the healthcare records of all patients discharged from the NRH with a ICD 10 code for HIBI from 2000-2018. Descriptive analysis and analysis of the level of disability (using Modified Barthel Index [MBI] and Disability rating scale [DRS]) and discharge destination was carried out using SpSS version 24.0. Results 572 episodes were recorded under the code g93.1. After exclusion of duplicate entries, the number of records analysed was 139. A further 35 were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. 104 records were reviewed systematically using a standardised proforma. 69 (66%) were male and 35 (33%) were female. Cardiovascular causes were most common (35.6%), followed by overdose (22.1%). Most had moderate to severe disability on admission (MBI and DRS). Severe disability was associated with respiratory arrest, overdose and neurological causes, while independence was most likely with cardiovascular causes. MBI and DRS improved in the majority (49% and 38.5%) with the greatest improvements seen with cardiovascular aetiology. 45.2 % of patients were discharged to their own home, 18.3% to a nursing home, and 18.3% to an acute hospital. Conclusion Improvement in functional outcomes following HIBI is correlated to aetiology. This may have implications in helping to predict patient outcome post-HIBI.

The aim was to determine the influence of melatonin on basal levels of glucose (BG) and HbA1c, activity of pyruvate kinase (PK) [EC 2.7.1.40] in the heart of alloxan diabetic rats under conditions of melatonin injections. The experiments were carried out on 60 sexually mature male albino rats with the body mass -(0,18 -0,20) kg. Alloxan diabetes was evoked via injecting the rats with a 5% solution of alloxan monohydrate intraperitoneally in a dose of 170 mg/kg of body weight. The animals were divided into groups: 1) control; 2) diabetic; 3) diabetic animals which were introduced the melatonin preparation intraperitoneally in a dose of 10 mg/kg of b.w. at 8 a. m. daily during 42 days starting with a 5-th 24 hour period after the injection of alloxan. Statistical analysis of results was conducted by Student's test. Sufficient level considered probability differences p\u2264 0,05. We got an increase of BG as well as HbA1c on 120 and 80% compared with control. Hyperglycemia caused degenerative changes in heart tissue including ischemia formation through development of microangiopathy. Same time the activity of PK was found to be decreased on 42% in comparison with control. It can be explained by low uptake of glucose from the blood to heart muscle in conditions of insulin deficiency that leads to a reduced rate of glucose metabolism. Melatonin led to normalization of BG level and markedly decreased of HbA1c. This was conducted with increase the activity of PK to normal value. It can be concluded that the administration of melatonin notably recovered the heart from hyperglycemia induced antioxidant imbalance, inflammation and apoptosis as well as rectified the imbalance in carbohydrate metabolism.

Total sample size needed was calculated and identified the minimum numbers of hand imprints needed in each staff category by using stratification method. Accordingly, 117 Hand imprints of the dominant hand were collected from 117 HCWs onto blood agar plates just before attending to a patient. Plates were incubated overnight at 35 o C and organisms identified according to standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic sensitivity performed according to CLSI methodology. Data analyzed with SPSS version 20.0. 117 hand imprints were collected from 18 doctors, 52 nurses and 47 health care assistants. 44 pathogens were grown from 42 (35.89%) of the samples. Commonest organism isolated was Acinetobacter spp. and it accounted for 18.8% of hand carriage. Coliforms carried by 11.96% , S.aureus by 5.13% and Pseudomonas spp. by 1.71%. 11 MDR organisms were isolated accounting for 9.4% of hand carriage. No association was found among pathogen carriage/MDR organisms and the staff category, unit or performance of hand hygiene. A considerable proportion of health care workers were carrying pathogenic organisms in their hands. Most of them were Gram negatives of which some were MDR organisms.

Colorectal cancer is associated with specific gene mutations. This research aims to analyse the genome using next generation sequencing techniques. The study evaluated patients with colorectal cancer in China. Next generation sequencing, with low costs, has been granted by health practitioners worldwide with its unprecedented level of accessibility to vast genomic information regarding their patients. In this study, the R open statistical computing software has been used, while referring to COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) to interpret global colorectal cancer genomic data provided by the ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium) Data Portal. This research is a stand-alone project and the objective was to deduplicate irrelevant data and consequently convert the patient mutation data into 31 different signatures. The percentage of these specific signatures would then allow us to deduce potential aetiologies for the genome mutations from tumour samples, from anonymised clinical data. In this study, we analysed 325 patients, with more than 6,000,000 mutation data points, for patients with colorectal carcinoma from China, using the R open statical computing software. The information was then deconstructed and different graphs were produced for all unique sample ID's, allowing for the visualization of weights of different mutation patterns. An additional command was used to identify the samples that are microsatellite instable, which is also known as Lynch syndrome, which is defect in the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2.",

Introduction Ebola and Marburg are Filoviruses that cause severe haemorrhagic fever in humans. Ebola and Marburg require fusion to a host cell-membrane, which is facilitated by the enveloped Glycoprotein 2 (GP2). GP2 possesses similarities to the HIV GP41 peptide, inhibitors for which have been described, but synthesis of such fusion-inhibitors for Filoviridae remains challenging. Methods A 40-mer viral peptide was synthesised using the CEM Liberty Blue peptide-synthesiser. A 2-Chlorotrityl Hydrazine resin was used as solid-support to modify the C-terminus with a hydrazide group, enabling us to conjugate the peptide to the oxidized 4-Cholestene-3one. To test the resin, a model 12-mer sequence was synthesised. Chromatographic analysis was carried out by RP-HPLC using Gemini 5 \u03bcm C18 110 \u00c5 columns. The mobile-phase consisted of buffer A: 0.1% TFA in water and buffer B: 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, with a gradient of over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min\u22121. Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed by ESI MS and recorded on Advion Expression.",

Background Infertility in males with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is well documented, with around 98% of men demonstrating azoospermia secondary to congenital bilateral agenesis of the vas deferens (CBAVD). As the structures for spermatogenesis (i.e. the testes and caput epididymis) remain intact, there is the potential for men with CF to father biological children through assisted reproductive technology, with pregnancy rates varying from 30-60%. Literature in the area of fatherhood in men with cystic fibrosis is scarce, and to date, there have not been any large scale studies conducted. The aim of this study, therefore, is to better understand the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of men with CF regarding their reproductive potential and options for fertility treatment. Methods A survey will be distributed to males aged 20-75 years currently in attendance at the adult CF clinic at St. Michaels Hospital during their routine clinical visit. The survey was created following a review of pertinent literature and interviews with CF patients and physicians. Questions were grouped into three sections: demographic information, knowledge and attitudes regarding fertility in men with CF, and experiences in starting a family. Out of pocket costs are included as a potential point of comparison with other CF populations worldwide. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse responses.",

Recent advances in the field of genomic medicine in conjunction with the advent of affordable high-throughput biological sequencing technologies have led to the accumulation of a wealth of genomic data. This project utilized RNA-sequencing techniques to elucidate differential gene expression between two cohorts of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) who demonstrated varying responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Identification of differentially expressed genes/novel pathways has the potential to inform treatment modalities, targeting patients on the basis of the molecular signatures of their tumours. To identify differentially expressed genes transcribed in patients who responded to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The RNA-seq counts of 17 patients with LARC who exhibited varying responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation served as the input for this project (X responders, Y non-responders). Differential gene expression analysis was then performed using the bioconductor package DESeq2 within RStudio to elucidate differences in the gene expression levels between the two response groups and to identify discriminatory genes/ pathways. Using an adjusted P-value of (0.1) and a fold change (FC) of \u2264 1.0 and \u22651.0 as cut-offs, 33 genes were found to be upregulated in the responders and 6 genes in the non-responders. IL24, a tumour microenvironment transformer, as well as an inducer of anti-cancer immunity in murine models of colorectal cancer was upregulated (FC= 0.18) in the 'responders.' The PURPL gene (p53 upregulated regulator of p53 levels), an intergenic long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), known to regulate basal p53 levels was also found to be upregulated in the 'responders' (FC = 0.044). Heparan sulfate 6-Osulfotransferase 2 (HS6ST2) was upregulated in the 'non-responders', FC = 11.178. Pre-existing literature has highlighted the overexpression of HS6ST2 mRNA in colorectal cancer and correlated its expression with poor survival outcomes. The discriminatory genes within the two patient groups may provide insights into novel therapeutic targets and challenge current treatment paradigms.",

The 2018-2019 measles outbreak has generated discussions on immunization policies and ethical dilemmas around policy design are at the center of current debates. Considering recent events, immunization policies should be re-examined. Public health strategies aim to provide the greatest benefit while minimally restricting individual liberties. This study aims to explore the views of healthcare professionals, primarily doctors, on ethics of routine childhood immunization policies, to suggest the optimal strategy for patients in England. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine doctors, working in primary care or paediatrics, and one specialist nurse to discuss their opinions around immunisation ethics. Immunization was described as a form of child protection but doctors were uncertain on who should define a child's best interest in the absence of an immediate infectious threat. The contribution of parental education to improve outcomes was well accepted and issues around informed consent and coerced decision-making were raised. There were clashing considerations about the trade-off between parental autonomy and community protection due to the impact of unimmunized groups on herd immunity. The role of personal views of doctors in consulting parents on immunizations was controversial. Lastly, the impact of different strategies on patient-doctor relationships was a major concern, thinking this could affect patient care overall. With the increasing emphasis put on building participatory patient-doctor relationships and on individual liberties, mandates may not be the optimal strategy for England. However, the recent pressures demand we prioritize patient education to improve parental confidence in vaccines. There is a lot of research conducted on antioxidant properties of glutathione, but the biochemical mechanism of its influence on H2Smetabolism under nephropathy is unknown. The experiment was conducted on albino mature rats which weighed 160 -180 g. Nephropathy was modeled by a single intraperitoneal folic acid injection at a dose of 250 mg/kg. Animals with nephropathy got an intragastric glutathione injection for 3 days, once daily, at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Desulfurizing activity of enzymes and concentration of H2S were determined in the cortical and medullary parts of kidneys. There was a decrease in H2S concentration in the kidneys of rats with nephropathy: in the medullary part by 27.8 % and in the cortical part by 16% compared to the control group. The activity of H2Sproducing enzymes: cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS) and cysteine aminotransferase decreased by 24.3% and 30.7% respectively in cortical part of kidneys of rats with nephropathy compared to the control group.",

However, survivors have an increased risk for debilitating late-effects of radiation therapy that contribute to poor muscle health in adulthood. Radiation induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by muscle atrophy, fibrosis, and impaired regeneration. Fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) coordinate with inflammatory cells, including macrophages, during muscle regeneration. Previous studies have examined the effect of radiation on adult skeletal muscle; however, little is known regarding the role of FAPs and macrophages in skeletal muscle development following juvenile radiation exposure. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in FAP and muscle macrophage content over a time-course following localized radiation (IRR). We hypothesized that radiation will contribute to long-term reductions in FAP content, and a prolonged inflammatory response. Methods Five-week-old, male, CBA mice were exposed to ionizing radiation (16 Gy) to the left hindlimb (n=32). The right leg was shielded and used as a contralateral control.

These data provide novel cellular targets for reducing the negative long-term consequences of radiation exposure on skeletal muscle in childhood cancer survivors. The uterus and uterine cervix ligament concept is a decisive factor for female pelvis surgery and for fundamental mechanisms of urogenital dysfunction ascertainment. The rectouterine ligament (RUL) has aroused great interest in terms of its use for surgical support in the management of pelvic organ prolapse. The purpose of the study is to clarify the RUL macro-and microstructure in postnatal ontogenesis of different age groups. Investigations have been performed in 37 anatomical specimens. The following investigational methods have been used: macroscopy, microscopy of histological sections series, conventional and thin preparations. Statistical data processing was performed with the licensed program \"RSTUDIO.\" At the 1st, 2nd adult, elderly, and senile ages RUL consists of two symmetric peritoneal folds, which cover RUL behind uterine and laterally from the rectum. The ureter crosses lower inferior hypogastric plexus top-down, outside-inside. The hypogastric nerve is available on each side under the ureter, goes posterior-anterior, top-down, and rounds RUL from the outside. Pelvis nerves have been identified as derivatives of the third-forth anterior branches of sacral plexus, changing direction down to RUL. They join, forming the lower inferior hypogastric plexus in the lateral part of RUL and in the posterior layer of the broad ligament. In the cervix end of the RUL there is a large number of vessels available. It contains smooth muscles, dense connective tissue, blood and nerve. In the intermediate one third vessels there are a moderate number of vessels with the main tissue components being connective tissue. In the sacral oneseven less, they consist of loose connective tissue and fatty inclusions. Our results show the RUL's anatomical relationships, in particular, to the ureter and inferior hypogastric plexus. RUL can be subdivided into three sections and may be used for improvement of existing and development of new methods of surgical correction and treatment of different lesions of urogenital system.",

Convenience of cancer screening, in terms of accessibility (location, opening times) and integration with other existing health services (e.g. reproductive or HIV care) has a positive effect on service uptake. Awareness of cancer and related services, and perceived quality of screening (having a dedicated room in the clinic, privacy, staff professionalism etc.) are significant determinants of patient satisfaction. Capitalising on these lessons is essential to strengthen service delivery in Malawi and improve early detection and treatment of cancer.",

Chemotherapeutic resistance arises through complex genetic and epigenetic changes, and tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes (small EVs, sEVs), may be implicated in this process. Previous studies have shown significant upregulation of several proteins in cisplatin-resistant versus cisplatin-sensitive NB cell lines. One of these proteins, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), was selected for this study due to its established role in carcinogenesis and presence in tumour-derived EVs. Therefore, we hypothesise that changes due to cisplatin resistance in the NB cellular proteome would be reflected in the NB sEV proteome. Hence, this study aimed to determine sEV number, protein concentration and EGFR protein expression in two NB cell lines, Kelly (cisplatin-sensitive) and KellyCis83 (cisplatin-resistant). Methods Two human-derived NB cell lines, Kelly and KellyCis83, were cultured. EVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation, characterised by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), western blots and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and then quantified by NTA.

Early detection of elevated blood pressure and associated mild obesity or overweight can lead to prevention of its evolution into full-blown disease as the child matures. Although humans have always suffered from detriments to mental health, psychiatry as the modern profession it is known as today, is relatively new. Psychiatry is a field in which models of care are numerous and consistently emerging. Both psychotherapy and biological psychiatry are continuously evolving. We are currently able to provide a multitude of medications for varied diagnoses, as well as an abundance of psychotherapy modalities. Psychotherapy is currently on the decline in psychiatry, while pharmacotherapy and other biological interventions dominate. All interventions provided by psychiatrists are evidence based and well researched, but rarely have patients been asked for their preference and its influence on the effectiveness of their care. This study aims to bridge that gap by asking patients about their preferred interventions. The main objective of this study is to determine the alignment between patients' preferences and available resources for the management of mental health conditions. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric intervention, regardless of modality, is more effective when it is the patients' treatment of choice. At the moment, there are currently no results available for this study, however, this study aims to survey 50 patients who are currently accessing mental health services at Michael Garron Hospital and WoodGreen Community Services in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The exclusion criteria would include: Patients with psychotic disorders and learning disorders, non-English speakers and patients under the age of 18. It is believed that by offering a patient their treatment of choice, they will be more inclined to be engaged in their treatment and less likely to withdraw as a result of their engagement.",

Pro-Gly-Pro peptide (PGP) effectively protects the gastric mucosa from damage caused by prolonged administration of monosodium glutamate (food supplement). PGP also is able to influence the structure of the central nervous system. Its acetylation makes PGP more resistant to the action of prolyl peptidases and prevents its hydrolysis.

Therefore, it is possible that PGP has a gastroneuroprotective effect, which could be mediated by its dipeptide derivative, GP.

These inclinations could be correlated to the upsurge in smoking rates and chronic exposure to UV rays without adequate protection or the application of tanning beds among the Romanian population. One of the causes of the adverse effects of reconstruction of the aorto-hip-popliteal segment is the development of reperfusion complications. The aim of the work is to prevent the development of reperfusion complications through the use of techniques and surgical interventions in the revascularizing surgical treatment of atherosclerotic multilevel occlusion of the major arteries of the lower extremities. 46 patients with a high risk of reperfusion complications were included in the work. In all patients, the lower extremity with a high risk of reperfusion complications was characterized by III A-B-IV \u0441hronic arterial insufficiency (CAI), the contralateral lower limb -II A-B CAI. To determine the degree of ischemic lesions of the lower limb, a modified classification of Fontaine R. has been applied taking into account the criteria of the European Working Group (1992). Aortic decli\u0440ation determines the course of blood flow restoration along the main arteries of the lower extremities. In aorto-bifemoral bypass, blood flow should be restored along the branch of bypass alternately. The blood flow is restored first along the branches of the unproblematic lower limb. Secondarily, blood flow is restored along the branches of the lower limb, from which reperfusion complications are expected. The indicated sequence of restoration of blood flow according to alloprosthesis makes it possible to halve the force of the shock wave of blood flow along the arterial bed of the problem lower limb. In case of multilevel atherosclerotic occlusal process of the lower extremity arterial bed: aorto/iliac-femoral and femur-popliteal segments, in which there is a suspicion of reperfusion complications, only aorto/ilio-femoral bypass is suspected. The specified volume of the operation makes it possible to eliminate the propagation of the shock wave of blood flow in the distal segments of the lower limb.",

Myosin IIA mutations can cause MYH9related disease resulting in bleeding. To which extent myosin dysfunction compromises platelet functions beyond platelet biomechanics, namely the secretion of alpha granules, is not well understood. By directly inhibiting myosin IIA in vitro using blebbistatin (BBT) we aimed to distinguish between effects on the actin cytoskeleton and granule secretion, respectively. Methods Blood was obtained from healthy consenting volunteers according to national regulations. Washed platelets were seeded onto fibrinogen (Fg) or von Willebrand Factor (vWF) coated coverslips in the presence of BBT (1-100\u03bcM) for 1 hour, fixed, stained for filamentous actin and vinculin, and imaged by confocal microscopy to determine the alignment of actin fibers. To address platelet secretion, washed platelets were preincubated with BBT (1.25...80 \u03bcM) and anti-P-selectin for 10 minutes, then activated with 10 nM thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) and analysed by flow cytometry to determine the % of P-selectin positive platelets. Results BBT concentrations 16 \u03bcM and higher inhibited actin stress fiber formation of spread platelets on Fg, as well as on vWF. P-selectin expression in TRAP-activated platelets decreased between 0-10 \u03bcM BBT by 20% and remained constant at higher doses.",

The routine use of aspirin is given to children post cardiac surgery in order to prevent platelet aggregation. 2-5mg/kg is prescribed empirically. There are no prospective studies that prove the effectiveness or adequateness of aspirin's antiplatelet effect in children after congenital heart surgery. Therefore, is 2-5 mg/ kg of aspirin effectively inhibiting platelet aggregation post cardiac surgery in children? Methods Retrospective review of 65 cardiology charts from 2015-2018 at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. Phone calls were made to ask parents about children's compliance to aspirin drug type and method of distribution of drug. Laboratory results were given blindly and used to determine the percentage of platelet inhibition. Results 23.08% or 15 children on an aspirin dose of 1.13-1.28 mg/kg received adequate and effective treatment. 76.92% or 50 children were inadequately treated. Most children were on a 2-5 mg/kg dose of aspirin and underwent Glenn, Fontan, and Norwood procedures. All ages and both genders were present throughout which did not impact results. All patients were compliant to aspirin according to phone calls to parents. Discussion 2-5 mg/kg of aspirin is not fully effective in bringing about treatment in some patients. Factors that affect treatment include: dosing method-aspirin type, genetic mutations, age-metabolism rate, surgery type, and rate of absorption. Further work needs to be done to rule out the above factors.",

These findings can inform future research in pharmacy practice and education. The risk of having a seizure is greatest at the neonatal period. It can lead to various disabilities such as epilepsy, autism and death. P2X7 receptor is an ATP-gated ion receptor located on the membrane of cells. It is mainly activated by high amounts of extracellular released ATP occurring during pathological conditions, thus P2X7 targeting may lead to less side effects.

On foot of previous evidence suggesting that management of VRFs may delay the onset of dementia, we aimed to assess the burden of VRFs in individuals presenting to a memory clinic with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), who may be an increased risk of progression to dementia.
