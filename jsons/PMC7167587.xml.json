Approximately 42000 medical staff supported the control of COVID-19 in Wuhan from the rest of China. A correspondence mentioned that our study adopted the mobile app-based questionnaire and pushed it to individuals via WeChat, probably causing a bias of the enrolled individuals (Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020). The main reason is that the strict isolation for stopping human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus did not allow us to perform large-scale and face-to-face studies during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

A correspondence mentioned that the groups enrolled in this study did not remove confounding factors (Ghaffari et al., 2020). The main reason is that the enrolled front-line nurses from all over the country were middle-level backbone staff with rich work experience and psychological capacity. In addition, the current form of our research is short communication. Due to the space limitation, we failed to show more data, such as the result of regression analysis.",

It is noteworthy that the evolution of psychological problems is a developmental process. After short-term medical support work for COVID-19 control, the effects of various psychological stressors may be strengthened, and psychological problems will gradually emerge. The onset of psychological crisis is commonly 3 months after the end of medical support work, and its peak is approximately 6 months later (Hsiao et al., 2020). Therefore, even though the COVID-19 epidemic is over, it is of great importance to continue tracking the development of vicarious traumatization in medical staff as well as the general public.",
