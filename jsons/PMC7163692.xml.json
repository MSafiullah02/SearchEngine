However, thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein is a frequent complication. To investigate whether the transverse facial venous sinus (TFVS) represents a suitable alternative site for collection of blood samples, clinicians at Oregon State University performed a prospective study, comparing the values for blood lactate, packed cell volume and total solids in blood samples collected simultaneously from the TFVS and the jugular vein in a group of healthy horses and also another group of critically ill horses 1.Values for these parameters were similar for the 2 sites and the authors concluded that the TFVS is a useful blood sampling site for both healthy and ill patients.",

Despite major advances in neonatal care, mortality rates are still significant and clinicians continue to seek better prognostic tools. Lactate is a biomarker reflecting global tissue hypoxia, inadequate oxygen utilisation, sepsis and disease severity. An EVJ supplement paper authored by Borchers et al. detailed a large multicentre prospective study that evaluated the correlation between serial blood lactate concentration and primary diagnosis with survival/nonsurvival in 643 foals 2. Lactate concentration was found to be a strong independent biomarker to predict mortality in critically ill foals. Foals admitted with a lactate value above 4.4 mmol/l had a grave prognosis as did foals whose lactate values did not decrease over time. Septic foals and nonsurviving foals have impaired lactate metabolism and sequential lactate monitoring can be used to identify patients at high risk for mortality.",

Several papers concerned the detection and characteristics of Rhodococcus equi infections in foals, with data indicating that traditional screening methods (serial blood measurements or thoracic ultrasound imaging) are ineffective at predicting which foals will develop clinically significant disease. Other papers reported on emerging conditions that are caused by toxic agents (fatal illness that followed avocado ingestion), inheritance (junctional epidermal bullosa [JEB] in Belgian draught horses) or infections (Leishmaniasis, coronavirus). Papers of immediate clinical and practical interest to practitioners included work from Cornell University that showed that a new device that attaches to a standard \u2018smartphone\u2019 produces basic heart rate and heart rhythm analysis that is comparable with a traditional \u2018wired\u2019 base apex electrocardiogram 3. Clinicians from University of California (UC) at Davis presented data that showed that ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) is stable in plasma and whole blood without centrifugation for at least 24 h and is also stable if frozen for at least 30 days 4. This new information will allow clinicians more leeway in collecting and storing samples from horses at their home stables for pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction testing. A second paper from UC Davis reported on the use of pooled faecal and environmental samples for the detection of Salmonella species by real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction 5. The method reported, which includes an enrichment culture step, provides a simple method for cost\u2010effective biosurveillance for salmonellosis in equine hospitals.",

This technique is used to produce foals from infertile mares and from stallions with limited sperm stores. Foss and Ortiz coupled a nicely illustrated paper on the technique of oocyte collection by transvaginal ultrasound guided follicular aspiration 6 with a second paper that detailed experimental work that simulated various protocols that could be used to transport immature and maturing oocytes for ICSI. The EVJ supplement contains the full paper detailing their data on oocyte storage protocols 7. In this paper, a large number of oocytes from both dominant (maturing) follicles and subordinate (immature) follicles were collected by transvaginal aspiration from 28 mares, incubated overnight at room or body temperature and stored in various media and containers prior to ICSI and then the rate of successful blastocyst production was detailed. This work helps define the conditions that optimise successful transport of oocytes from the field to the centres that offer ICSI, making ICSI a viable option for practitioners in the future. The highest blastocyst rates (70%) were reported for maturing oocytes aspirated from dominant follicles that were maintained at 37\u00b0C in equilibrated media prior to ICSI but the authors were also able to achieve reasonable blastocyst rates (35\u201337%) with immature oocytes that were maintained in commercial media at room temperature prior to ICSI.",

Exposure of horses to ergot alkaloids is common in areas like the southeastern United States, where tall fescue that has a high rate of colonisation with commensal fungal endophytes, is a common pasture grass. The risks of ergot alkaloids in broodmares are well known as ingestion of these fungal endophyte byproducts in late gestation is associated with increased rates of prolonged gestation, premature placental separation, dystocia, retained placenta and agalactica. However, the risks of ergot alkaloid exposure in breeding stallions have not been assessed. Six stallions were fed either toxic endophyte infected tall fescue seed or nontoxic seed. Although ergot alkaloid exposure was associated with slightly reduced gel\u2010free volume in subsequent ejaculate samples, no significant changes were noted in sperm motility, morphology, total numbers or other factors that would be postulated to reduce fertility. This study gives good data that will help veterinarians who practice in environments where tall fescue is common to advise horse owners on feeding and management of breeding stallions.",

The authors have performed the procedure in over 90 standing sedated patients, using a special stand that holds the leg in light flexion. An 18 gauge disposable arthroscope is inserted in various locations to visualise the compartments of this complex joint. This technique represents a major advance that will allow clinicians to assess the stifle in a clinic setting without the need for general anaesthesia and facilitate the diagnosis of a variety of conditions. The procedure will distinguish patients that require surgery from patients requiring medical treatment of their joint condition. The authors also speculate that with expanded use, needle arthroscopy will be an accurate and economical way to assess progress in this joint after surgery or during rehabilitative programmes.",

Nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well established as useful medications for this purpose but these drugs are contraindicated in some patients and there is concern of toxic effects at high doses. Foreman and Ruemmler from the University of Illinois presented data on the effect of i.m. meperidine hydrochloride (a narcotic also known as Demerol) as a skeletal analgesic in horses. Their full paper is available in the EVJ online supplement 14. They used an adjustable heart bar shoe to induce severe short\u2010term lameness in a group of 8 horses and then administered either meperidine or saline to each horse i.m. They compared the resultant reduction in lameness parameters to similar experiments that had been done to assess the analgesic effects of NSAIDs. They found that i.m. meperidine was followed by improvement in heart rate and lameness scores for the treated horses, but the effect was short\u2010term (<3.7 h) as compared with previous data on NSAIDs which showed analgesic effects lasting 8\u201312 h. The authors commented that intermittent dosage of a narcotic between NSAID administration might allow a decreased dosage of NSAIDs in horses with severe skeletal pain, thus reducing NSAID\u2010related toxicity.",

Another paper from Colorado State University provided data that showed the technique commonly employed to block the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve for the diagnosis of pain in the proximal suspensory area may not be specific to that nerve: contrast dye studies demonstrated that injected medication may enter the tarsal sheath, the tarsometatarsal joint or other subtarsal regions of the hind leg 16.

Post anaesthetic colic is a serious risk of general anaesthesia. Clinicians at Colorado State University did a retrospective study of 416 horses that underwent general anaesthesia for a variety of nongastrointestinal surgeries and imaging studies over a period of 3 years. Their full paper, which assessed a variety risk factors associated with post anaesthetic colic, is reproduced in the EVJ supplement 18. Three risk factors that were significant for the development of colic were increasing blood lactate levels, a delay of 7 or more hours in the passage of faeces after anaesthesia and patients of Arabian bloodlines. The overall rate of post anaesthetic colic was 5.3% with intestinal impaction or nonspecific abdominal pain comprising most of the cases. Delayed faecal output was reported in 8.7% of cases.
