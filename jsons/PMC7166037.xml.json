However, these reports are mainly aimed at general populations whose immunity was usually undisturbed before the disease occurred. Given that both innate and adaptive immunity play important roles in the clearance of viral infection, it is not clear whether COVID-19 pneumonia has its own specific effects in immunocompromised populations. The immune response, particularly the T-cell response, in these special populations is significantly suppressed because of the long-term use of immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations may produce more severe clinical symptoms, a longer duration of illness, and a worse prognosis than in immunocompetent patients.",

A report of 72 314 COVID-19 cases in the general population from China's Infectious Disease Information System showed that most confirmed cases (81%) were classified as mild, while only 19% were either severe or critical [7]. In the present study, the proportion of severe cases (80%) was significantly higher than that of their infected family members (10%) and that reported in the general population (19%) [7]. In addition, with the exception of one patient who died and one who has not yet been discharged, the average duration of illness was approximately 35 d, nearly twice as long as that of the control family member group (18.8 d) and of the general population, as reported in the literature (about 17\u201320 d) [3], [7]. Moreover, the post-transplant patients needed a much longer time to become negative for the SARS-COV-2 virus than their infected family members. These results suggest that because of their immunosuppressive status, transplant recipients may experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia and a more difficult recovery than those in the general population.",

It is worth noting that the protection of renal graft function during the course of the disease is particularly important for these special patients. Elevated serum creatinine has been reported in approximately 4\u201310% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [2], [13]. However, six of the 10 transplant patients in our study had elevated serum creatinine.
