Non-enveloped viruses are encapsulated by a protein coat, called a capsid, while enveloped viruses are encapsulated in a host-derived lipid membrane implanted with viral proteins called spikes. The coat protein of non-enveloped viruses and spike proteins of enveloped viruses facilitate the virus\u2019s entry into the cell. These viral proteins engage receptors on host cells to promote attachment to the host cell surface, but after that initial binding event, non-enveloped and enveloped viruses breach host cell membranes through different pathways [1]. Non-enveloped viruses typically enter cells by endocytosis and then either lyse the intracellular compartment, or release genetic material through a pore created in the membrane of the intracellular compartment [2, 3]. Enveloped viruses, on the other hand, must undergo membrane fusion with a cellular membrane to release their genetic material into the host cell (Fig. 2.1).\n",

For enveloped viruses, the fusion or spike proteins embedded in the envelope are responsible for both receptor binding and membrane fusion. Membrane fusion proteins can be subdivided into three categories based on their structure [5]. Class I fusion proteins are primarily \u03b1-helical, Class II fusion proteins contain mainly \u03b2-sheets and \u03b2-strands, and Class III fusion proteins contain a mix of both \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets. Class I and II fusion proteins require a proteolytic priming event to convert them from a fusion-incompetent state to a fusion-competent one. Once the fusion protein is in a fusion-competent state, the structural rearrangement necessary for exposure of the fusion peptide and its burial into the target membrane is often triggered by some change in environmental conditions. Fusion may be triggered by receptor binding itself, lowering of pH, protease action [6], or a combination of these [4, 7]. Viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane may be triggered by receptor binding or protease activation, while those that fuse within the endosome generally require low pH and may require other additional cues, such as changes in other ions than protons, or endosome-specific protease exposure.",

[5] and Harrison [8]. After fusion is triggered, the protein rearranges into a prehairpin intermediate (1) with the fusion peptide inserted into the host membrane. While the fusion protein may be found as dimers or trimers on the surface of the virus (2), the prehairpin intermediate consists of a trimer. It is thought that several prehairpin intermediates cluster together then fold back on themselves to bring the membranes close to each other (3). As the prehairpins fold into a six-helix bundle, the membranes are brought close enough that lipids from their outer leaflets are able to mix, creating a structure often referred to as a \u201cstalk\u201d (4). This step is known as hemifusion. Lastly, a pore forms (5) enabling the viral genome to pass through this opening as the fusion proteins form into a stable trimer of hairpins.\n",

Ensemble methods provide information on the broader context of entry steps, while single virion imaging provides detailed information on the dynamics of those steps. Ensemble methods include many of the most well-established techniques for studying viral entry and may probe overall infection, receptor binding, fusion, or cargo transfer. Single virion imaging techniques can provide mechanistic detail and kinetics for steps that are masked in ensemble methods. In addition, for HIV [9], influenza [10], and Ebola virus [11], most virions that encounter a cell are not involved in productive entry so the ability of single virion techniques to distinguish entry-competent particles from non-competent ones and characterize their individual behavior provides valuable data on heterogeneity in viral populations and its ultimate impact on infection.",

This configuration is achieved by setting the incidence angle of the laser to be higher than the critical angle for total internal reflection of the laser light at the glass/water or glass/cell interface, resulting in an exponentially decaying evanescent field that penetrates roughly 100 nm into the sample [24, 25]. The advantage with this configuration is that a two-dimensional plane can be monitored precisely, enabling the distinction between binding and fusion events of the virions, with appropriate virion labeling (described next). However, no three dimensional tracking information can be obtained; data collection is confined to the interfacial region of interest. This configuration is most suitable for examination of virus behavior at biomimetic surfaces like supported lipid bilayers or live cell plasma membranes close to the glass surface.",

Fluorescent viral protein constructs can be prepared for enveloped [30] or non-enveloped viruses [31, 32] and virions are labeled as they are synthesized. Chemical labels, including Alexa dyes, octadecylrhodamine B (R18), and carbocyanine perchlorates (DiD, DiI, or DiO) may be added during virion synthesis or post-production.

It is also possible to incorporate pH sensors into the envelope of virions to measure the pH of the fusion environment [35]. In all cases, care must be taken to ensure that labeling does not adversely impact viral infectivity. This can be easily assessed by conducting cell infectivity assays with labeled virions. In general, these labeling approaches can be optimized to mitigate any significant negative impact.",

Today\u2019s fast computers and image processing algorithms assist in noise filtering, virion tracking, and trajectory mapping, as described in the references that follow. In single virion imaging, noise is always a primary concern, regardless of the microscope configuration. To combat this, several particle detection and image restoration techniques have been developed specifically for single virion tracking [36, 37]. Coordinates of the particles are obtained by scanning filtered images for areas of fluorescence intensity that exceed a certain threshold or fit a particular intensity profile [38, 39]. The next challenge is obtaining accurate virion tracking from one frame to the next (temporal trajectories). Particle trajectories can be calculated from nearest-neighbor associations [21, 40]. Measurements of virion movement and mean squared displacements are then used to determine whether the virions exhibit directed, normal, or anomalous diffusion [41]. The diffusion type can indicate the type of interactions the virion is having with the surface of the cell or extracellular environment. Tracking frame-to-frame is important in measuring binding residence times as well, and by extension, binding strength characteristics [37]. Once bound, the progression of membrane fusion can be tracked from frame-to-frame using strategies like fluorescence dequenching, where the evolution of the fluorescence signal reports on the merging of membranes, the rate of membrane mixing, and the release of viral genome. Finally, obtaining good statistical data from virion tracking experiments requires collecting data on hundreds of individual virions.",

However, BLMs are fragile and prone to rupture and continued progress using this approach was slow. In recent years, supported lipid bilayers, which are more robust than BLMs, have become more widely used in in vitro single virion tracking experiments.

These supported lipid bilayers act as mimics for cellular membranes and the compatibility of these bilayers with flat glass surfaces makes them ideal for coupling to microscopy techniques. Additionally, supported bilayers may be assembled within a flow cell or microfluidic device, which enables the exchange of buffers and, consequently, the precise control over the binding and fusion environment during single virion tracking microscopy.

This feature enables the two-dimensional mobility of lipids within the bilayer necessary for membrane fusion, but mobility is also a key property for allowing receptors to rearrange to permit multivalent binding interactions, as they do in live cell membranes. Mobility of protein receptors, particularly those with transmembrane domains, can be a challenge in these platforms if the water gap is insufficient for limiting interaction between the protein and the glass support. To overcome this challenge, various cushions, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) [52], bovine serum albumin, dextran [33, 57], or polyelectrolyte brushes [54], have been placed between the bilayer and the supporting surface to improve protein mobility [58].",

Second, in these platforms, the buffers in contact with the virus can have a defined composition and the experimenter controls the timing and order of exposure to proteases, pH, or any other component of interest to the virus. But perhaps the most salient feature of this experimental approach is that these platforms allow detailed examination of the binding and membrane fusion process and gathering of dynamic data from these processes. However, the two-dimensional, in vitro nature of these platforms make them unsuitable for measuring cytoskeletal involvement in entry. Thus, to obtain the most complete information about the infection process, combining data from complementary approaches using live cells and biomimetic platforms is an excellent strategy.",

            "text": "Tracking virion movement in the in vivo environment has revealed various avenues of virus spread to surrounding cells. The predominant transport mechanisms of virus spread between cells are: (1) virions freely diffusing through the extracellular environment to neighboring cell surfaces, or (2) spreading to neighboring cells through direct transmission across adjoining membranes. For the first mechanism, the mean-squared displacement of virions over time is used to classify their motion as diffusive or sub-diffusive through the extracellular environment. For example, live cell single virion tracking of adeno-associated viruses [17] and simian virus 40 virus-like particles [62] indicates that particles undergo normal diffusion in the extracellular environment. Adeno-associated viruses slow down when in the vicinity of a cell, and touch the cell membrane multiple times before penetrating the cell [17]. In contrast, HIV follows the second mechanism and preferentially transmits directly from one neighboring cell to another through virological synapses rather than transmission by extracellular diffusion [63\u201365] Some viruses exploit cytoskeletal components to facilitate transport from one cell to another. Vaccinia virus, for example, induces the formation of actin protrusions from the cell surface and is transported along these to spread from cell to cell [66]. Looking at viral transport over a longer distance scale, single virion imaging has shown that pseudorabies virus is able to spread from the site of infection to the peripheral nervous system ganglia for replication then back along axons to reseed the initial infection site [67]. In vitro experiments have been used to study how respiratory mucosa hinders the ability of pseudorabies virus to cross into the epithelium, revealing that both size and charge interactions are important [68].",

One method is labeling the core of virions and cellular actin (to delineate the border of cells) and track virion movement along the periphery of the cell [69]. Another method is to label the viral membrane and look at diffusion on top of membrane until the virion overlaps with an endocytosis site [70]. A few examples of virion movement that have been studied this way are as follows. Simian virus 40 undergoes actin independent diffusive movement on the cell membrane until it reaches caveolae [71]. Dengue virus similarly freely diffuses on the membrane until it reaches an existing clathrin-coated pit [70]. Murine polyoma virus-like particles also freely diffuse at first, then become confined and follow actin-directed trajectories afterwards [72]. Vaccinia bound to filopodia have been observed to move towards the cell body along the plasma membrane [73].",

This analysis was then extended to studies of virus-like particles [49, 81] and live virions [81] interacting with glycosylated bilayers to provide new insight into virus attachment to cell surfaces and applications in biosensing [82]. The kinetics of particle detachment [83] can also be studied in these platforms, as can multivalent binding behavior [62, 84]. Such studies can reveal changes in binding behavior that promote viral attachment. For example, both influenza and canine parvovirus undergo \u201cadhesion-strengthening\u201d where the longer a virion is bound, the more strongly it adheres to the bilayer [37, 85]. Overall, these platforms are convenient for gathering insight on this critical virus entry step and how it depends on the host cell surface.",

For example, single particle binding studies have revealed the importance of microdomains in binding of norovirus-like particles, which preferentially bind the edges of glycosphingolipid-enriched domains [49]. Later it was also shown that HIV particles prefer to bind at the edges of cholesterol-rich lipid domains that were reconstituted in supported bilayers [86, 87]; however, observing this preference in live cells due to the small scale and dynamism of lipid rafts is difficult, illustrating the power of using an in vitro system for such studies. Focusing further on the receptors themselves, TIRF microscopy has also been used to measure the affinity of HIV glycoprotein 120 for the glycosphingolipids galactosyl ceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide and \u03b1-hydroxy glucosylceramide in SLBs [88, 89]. The affinity of glycoprotein 120 for these lipids is roughly 5 times lower than its affinity for CD4 [90].",

The simplest manner to measure virion binding to a particular host cell receptor is the cofloatation assay. In these assays, viral particles or purified fusion proteins are labeled with a probe and mixed with liposomes containing the receptor for the virus. After the virus has bound, the mixture can then be added to a sucrose gradient and fractionated. The fractions are analyzed with PAGE or Western Blot to determine under which conditions the virus and liposomes comigrate or cofloat [91, 92]. Altering the composition of the liposomes can be used to determine what lipids and proteins the virus binds to. This assay is able to probe virus-receptor interactions but does not provide information on binding kinetics. An additional limitation is that it may be difficult to purify or prepare liposomes containing the receptor, particularly if it is a transmembrane protein.",

In both approaches, biomimetic membranes can be used to preserve many properties of the host cell surface, including integration of the receptor. Kinetic analysis of binding with these techniques requires two experimental phases to decouple binding and unbinding of virions. In the first phase, virions are added to a biomimetic surface and bind to the receptors. In this way, an \u201con\u201d rate can be obtained. In the second phase, a virus-free buffer is added and the dissociation of the virus from the receptor is monitored. In this arrangement, an \u201coff\u201d rate can be obtained.",

For example, Reovirus induces the formation of clathrin-coated pits for uptake [97]. Simian virus 40 has the ability to induce actin rearrangement to further promote its own internalization whereas echovirus 1 does not [71, 98]. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is utilized for the uptake of many viruses including Australian bat lyssavirus [99], HIV [100], infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus [101], and rabiesvirus [74]. Other viruses are caveolin-independent or use macropinocytosis. For example, mouse polyomavirus is also delivered to early endosomes by a caveolin independent pathway [102]. Adenovirus 2 enters the cell viaboth clathrin dependent and independent endocytosis and triggers macropinocytosis [103\u2013106]. Still other viruses have been shown to be agile in their internalization route, for example, in the absence of caveolin, simian virus 40 can exploit a clathrin/caveolin independent pathway [107]. Studies have shown that bound influenza virions have the ability to induce the formation of clathrin-coated pits, but can also enter in a clathrin/caveolin independent manner [78]. Influenza is then preferentially sorted into a population of early endosomes that quickly matures [108].",

One common approach to determining if cytoskeletal elements are involved is to compare the speed and shape of virion trajectories in the presence and absence of cytoskeletal inhibitors such as nocodazole, and cytochalasin D [114]. This strategy has been employed to determine that reovirus movement after endocytosis is microtubule-directed [114]. Microtubules are involved in the cytosolic movement of Adeno-associated virus type 2 [115], HIV [30, 116] infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus [101], rabies virus [74], In contrast, polio movement inside cells is actin dependent, but microtubule independent [117]. Adenovirus interacts with minus-end dynein and a plus-end directed factor to traffic along cytoplasmic microtubules [118]. Influenza in endosomes undergoes unidirectional dynein-directed translocation to the perinuclear region followed by intermittent back-and-forth microtubule-dependent motion within the perinuclear region prior to virion fusion with endosomes [10].",

            "text": "Viral fusion at the plasma membrane can be differentiated from fusion within endosomes in live cells. To do so, the viral contents can be labeled with a diffusible content marker while the envelope is labeled with an acid-stable lipophilic dye. If fusion occurs at the plasma membrane, both fluorescent markers will seem to disappear because they will be diluted into the plasma membrane and cytosol. If fusion occurs within an endosome, the viral content marker will disappear as it is released into the cytosol and diluted, but the lipid marker will continue to appear bright as the dye mixes into the relatively small endosomal membrane [129]. This approach has been used to show that HIV can undergo full fusion inside endosomes while fusion at plasma membrane is halted at the lipid mixing step. However, this may be cell-type dependent; HIV content release from plasma membrane fusion was observed for U87 cells but not JC5.3 or HOS cells [130]. The ability to detect viral fusion in live cells within the endocytic pathway often relies on labeling virions with quenched amounts of dye. Colocalization of dequenching virions with labeled cellular components, such as clathrin or Rab proteins, can reveal whether fusion occurs in early or late stage endosomes. This approach has been employed in the study of influenza virus, which fuses in early endosomes, revealing that the virus is able to enter a clathrin-dependent manner as well as a clathrin and caveolin independent fashion, and viral fusion can occur in both pathways [78]. In macrophages, HIV undergoes fusion in Rab5A positive endosomes [100]. Fusion of Dengue virus [70] and Ebola virus [11] colocalizes with Rab7, a marker of late stage endosomes. Alternatively, endosomal fusion may be mimicked by binding virions to the plasma membrane then lowering the extracellular pH. This method of acid-induced endosomal bypass has been employed to characterize avian sarcoma and leukosis virus fusion behavior [131].",

This fit yields k, the rate constant of that step, and N, the number of stochastic rate limiting events governing the kinetics of that step [33]. If there is only one rate-limiting step (N = 1), the above equation simplifies to a single exponential decay. As the number of rate-limiting steps increases, more events must be observed to accurately calculate N. For processes with three steps or fewer, 50 events is sufficient to calculate N with a standard deviation of 1 [15]. There are other more complex methods for fitting lag time distributions that may capture more of the details of hemifusion [136].",

The ability to manipulate the composition of supported lipid bilayers has been used to determine that anionic lipids are essential for vesicular stomatitis virus fusion and that the lag between hemifusion and pore formation is shortened in the presence of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a lipid found in late endosomes [57]. Precisely controlling the triggering pH has revealed that influenza virus requires a lower pH to trigger fusion than Sindbis virus [34], suggesting that it fuses later in the endocytic pathway. While the rate of influenza X-31 virus hemifusion increases at lower pH [33], the rate of Brisbane is much less pH dependent [140]. The rate of pore formation for influenza virus is pH independent. Multiple influenza hemagglutinin trimers are involved in fusion [141], although not all are active participants [142, 143]. This platform is able to detect differences in the acid stability and fusion behavior of different strains and reassortants of influenza, which is tied to their tropism [140, 144]. This platform can also be used to measure the number of antibodies required to neutralize fusion of a single virion [145]. Figure 2.7 provides a summary of the flexibility, the biomimetic fusion assay and the kinds of insight that has been gained from these tunable assays. With the advances in supported bilayer complexity and fabrication, these platforms can also be used to study viruses that bind proteinaceous receptors, such as feline coronavirus [13].\n",

            "text": "A common method to study fusion behavior is cell-cell fusion assays, where fusion between target cells expressing the receptor for the virus and effector cells expressing the viral fusion protein is monitored. When the viral fusion protein is triggered, for example by lowering the pH, the cells fuse to each other, leading to clusters of multiple nuclei surrounded by a single cell membrane [146]. These clusters are known as syncytia. Lipophilic and aqueous dyes can be used to label the membrane and contents of the effector cell, providing readouts for lipid mixing or pore formation. To isolate the hemifusion step, fusion can be triggered then arrested by quickly cooling the cells to 4 \u00b0C [147, 148]. This rapid-cooling approach has been used to determine that hemifusion of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus requires low pH, but expansion of the fusion pore does not [148]. As an alternative to monitoring pore formation by observing the transfer of intracellular fluorescent cargo from effector cells to target cells [149], whole cell patch-clamp electrical measurements can be used [150]. In this configuration, a pipette connected to an electrode and amplifier pierces the membrane of the effector cell. The voltage across the membrane can be manipulated and the resulting current measured. During cell-cell fusion, the cell surface area increases as the membranes merge, resulting in an increase in membrane capacitance. Such measurements can also allow for estimation of fusion pore size [151].",

In one labeling approach, particles and/or liposome membranes can be labeled with fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) pairs. If fusion occurs, FRET will stop as the pairs become separated, and the fluorescence signal will change accordingly [153]. In the second labeling approach, particle membranes are labeled with a single quenched fluorescent marker [154]. Upon fusion with a liposome, the quenched fluorophores will become diluted and dequench, causing a marked increase in fluorescence.",

In this type of assay, target cells are loaded with a dye containing a \u03b2-lactam ring and a FRET pair. Chimeras of viral core proteins and BlaM are incorporated into virions. If virions are able to release their cargo during infection, BlaM will cleave the lactam ring, interrupting FRET and causing the cells to fluoresce a different color [155]. Infected and uninfected cells can then be sorted by flow cytometry for further analysis. This technique requires the ability to make chimeric proteins but otherwise does not require specialized equipment. BlaM activity assays have been combined with single virion imaging to indicate that HIV releases cargo by fusion inside endosomes and not fusion at the plasma membrane surface [156].",

However, liposomes containing the viral receptor may be hard to prepare if the receptor is a transmembrane protein.

No single technique is sufficient to determine all the steps or details of viral entry. Single virion tracking techniques can bridge the gap between detailed structural information and overall infection measurements to inform our understanding of the structure-function relationship of viral fusion proteins. The development of single virion tracking techniques has been dependent on advances in viral labeling, microscopy, and image analysis. These single virion techniques can be applied to study the progression of infection in live cells as well as used in a tightly-controlled biomimetic platform. Top-down cell culture approaches where inhibition or knockout of cellular components reveals their role in viral entry complement bottom-up biomimetic methods where components of interest are methodically added to the experimental platform. Combining information from these different techniques illuminates the framework of steps involved in viral entry and clarifies the mechanisms underlying each step.",

The location and mechanism of fusion can be impacted by environmental conditions, including pH, ions, protease activity, and lipid composition. Once the genome has been released into the cytosol, it can access cellular machinery, leading to replication of the viral genome and synthesis of new viral proteins.
