It was the only fungus which was shed by the calves on the 2 farms, for continuous, more or less prolonged periods, but exclusively in the winter months. Diarrhea and C. glabrata shedding seemed to be associated. C. glabrata colonized the abomasum (the functional equivalent of the monogastric stomach) but not the other segments of the digestive tract of the euthanized calf Based on the findings of this study it seems that while some yeast species may be considered as commensals of the digestive tract of calves, and consequently their isolation from intestinal contents or fecal samples has no clinical significance, others, such as C. glabrata may be involved in enteric pathogenic processes. Moreover, characteristics of the culture, previous chemotherapeutic treatments, the animal's age and possibly climatic conditions should be taken into account before deciding on the fungal isolate's clinical relevance. Determination of mycotic involvement in NCD by routine mycological examination of intestinal contents and fecal samples of diarrheic calves may be useful to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful antibacterial therapy.",

NCD may be caused by a highly virulent primary pathogen, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, or, more frequently, by mixed infections of various microorganisms [1] . While the role of viruses, bacteria and protozoa in causing NCD has been investigated [2] , the possible role of fungi in enteric pathology has received only limited attention. This is probably the result of the assumption that fungi are part of the normal microbial flora of the digestive system [3] and consequently of no clinical relevance, unless they are isolated in conjunction with pathological changes. This assumption, until recently prevailing in human medicine, has been subject to reconsideration. A number of reports published during the last years [4] [5] [6] indicate the possibility of connection between fungi, especially yeasts, and cases of diarrhea in human patients, especially children, with no recognizable underlying conditions to justify infection by opportunistic pathogens. Association between yeasts and disorders of the digestive tract in these cases was made by exclusion (no other pathological microorganisms found), the presence of an elevated number of yeasts in the feces, or fol-lowing failure of antibacterial therapy but successful treatment of the patient with antimycotic drugs.",

Two yeast colonies (of each species in mixed culture) were subcultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and identified by the ID 32C system (Bio-Meneux SA, Marcy l'Etoile, France). CHROMagar plates were kept for 7 days before being discarded as negative. Feed was examined for the presence of mycotic contamination as previously described [8] .",

All 6 calves on farm A had diarrhea which started between day 3 and 6 of their lives. C. glabrata was isolated from all but one of the calves. Shedding of this yeast started usually 3-5 days after the onset of diarrhea. The periods of C. glabrata shedding and intermittent diarrhea were generally overlapping. This phenomenon is especially evident in calf No. 010, which had diarrhea for an exceptionally long period (until 55 days of age) and shed C. glabrata for an equally prolonged time span (until 45 days of age). Based on the semi quantitative character of the culture method, an initial increase and a final decrease in C. glabrata colony counts was observed. During most of the shedding period, however, yeast cultures were extremely rich and consisted of confluent or semiconfluent growth of the C. glabrata. C. krusei, C. catenulata, rotavirus and cryptosporidia were found sporadically (Fig. 2) in low numbers and for not more than a few consecutive days. One exception was calf No. 009 (Fig. 2) , from which mixed cultures of C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. catenulata were isolated (the latter two in numbers higher than in other cases) for 10 days, during which it was treated with antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) against a mouth infection caused by Actinomyces pyogenes.",

Various diagnostic criteria have been suggested to differentiate between normal individuals shedding yeasts and patients afflicted with noninvasive fungal diarrhea. The presence of hyphae in the stools [13] is not sufficient as cases of diarrhea in which only budding yeast cells were observed in the feces and which were successfully treated with antimycotic drugs [14] have been reported. Moreover, one of the salient characteristics (and the cause of many taxonomic controversies) of C. glabrata is that it does not form either pseudo-or true hyphae. Heavy to confluent growth, such as cultured from the calves in this study, may be considered an indication of non-invasive fungal diarrhea [6] .",

C. glabrata has been reported to be the most prevalent yeast species in young calves, especially if fed with milk replacers, but was not found to be connected with diarrhea [15] .

This connection is underscored by the case of calf 010 on farm A, in which both diarrhea and excretion of the fungus were exceptionally prolonged. The nature of this connection is not clear and several possibilities must be considered: Although no pathological changes were present in the euthanized calf, other mechanisms, such as fungal metabolites, might be involved. This mode of action would be analogous to the one observed in enterotoxemic colibacillosis, where no or only mild pathologic changes are observed in the GIT during diarrhea [3] . (b) Conditions produced in the digestive tract by the diarrhea favor the proliferation of the yeast. The appearance of C. glabrata in the feces of the calf 2 days before its death following an incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia seems to support this possibility.

The examination of the euthanized calf showed that the abomasum was the only segment of the GIT in which an interaction between the mucosa and the yeasts was observed. The clear predominance of C. glabrata in cultures made from these segments indicates that the yeasts observed microscopically are C. glabrata as well. This assumption is further substantiated by the morphology (absence of hyphae and pseudohyphae) of the yeast cells. Colonization of the human stomach by yeasts, including C. glabrata, has been reported [17, 18] , often without the induction of pathological changes [17] . Due to the low pH, the only yeast species able to grow in this organ have to be able to do so under stringent acidic conditions. The C. glabrata isolates examined in this study were found comparable to human isolates [17, 19] , to be highly acid resistant, and thus capable of growth in the abomasum. Higher pH values and a competitive intestinal microflora, established earlier than in the abomasum, are likely causes for the limited colonization of the intestine by C. glabrata.",

A common factor to these cases was the treatment of the animals with antibacterial drugs, considered predisposing to fungal infections. Animals included in the field trial, (with the exception of calf 009 on farm A), were not subjected to antibacterial treatment. The medicated dry food made available to the calves on farm B is unlikely to have been ingested in relevant quantities given the young age of the animals. It is noteworthy that the only period during which yeast species other than C. glabrata (C. krusei and C. catenulata) were isolated for 10 consecutive days was parallel to the period of antibacterial treatment of calf 009 on farm A. This observation, in addition to the self-limiting characteristic of C. glabrata colonization in untreated calves seems to support other reports [20] [21] [22] [23] which indicate that antibacterial treatment may induce pathological processes in which yeasts are involved.",
