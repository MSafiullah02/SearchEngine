In the direct method, a known serum with fluorescent antibodies supposedly corresponding to the sample under study\u2014a specimen with the antigen\u2014is deposited on the sample. In the case of the formation of the antigen\u2013antibody complex, the attached antibodies are detected by luminescent microscopy in the form of a fluorescent signal with different degree of intensity determined visually by the researcher and depending on the number of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies attached to the cell. When performing indirect analysis, an immune serum nonlabeled to the sought causative agent is deposited on the antigen. In the case in which the serum antibodies correspond to the antigen, an antigen\u2013antibody immune complex is formed. Then, an antispecies serum with fluorochrome is deposited on the preparation. Thus, antibodies of the first serum serve as an antigen for labeled antibodies of the antispecies serum. The forming double complex is determined using a luminescent microscope. The indirect method is more universal because using a single fluorescent serum allows one to reveal different species of microorganisms.",

The main requirements to fluorochromes used for labeling of specific proteins are the distinguishability of their fluorescence color from the autofluorescence of the object under study, contrasting with the background, high fluorescence intensity after conjugation with the protein, and preservation of main physicochemical and serological properties of antibodies. For the fluorochrome, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) [5, 6], rhodamine sulfonyl chloride (RSC) [7, 8], rhodamine sulfonyl fluoride (RSF) [9, 10], tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) [11, 12], dichlorotriazinylamino-fluorescein (DCTAF) [13, 14], etc., are used. Such organic compounds emit yellow-green, yellow, and red fluorescence. The dye that is most often used as a label of antibodies is FITC. This dye, the molecular formula of which is C21H11NO5S, causes a green fluorescence; it bonds covalently to biomolecules via the NCS functional group and has a high quantum yield [15, 16]. The maximums of the absorption and fluorescence wavelengths are 495 and 520 nm, respectively [17]; owing to this, the background fluorescence of biological specimens is reduced to the minimum.",
