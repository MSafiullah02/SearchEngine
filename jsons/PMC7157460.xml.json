The lipid bilayer is derived from host cell membranes during the process of virus assembly and budding. Consequently, infection of host cells requires that enveloped viruses fuse their membrane with cellular membranes to release the nucleocapsid and accessory proteins into the host cell in order to establish a new infectious cycle. Glycoproteins from enveloped viruses evolved to combine two main features. Firstly, they contain a receptor binding function, which attaches the virus to the host cell. Secondly, they include a fusion protein function that can be activated to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Both tasks can be encoded by a single glycoprotein or by separate glycoproteins, which act in concert.",

            "text": "The biophysics of membrane fusion is dominated by the stalk hypothesis. According to this view, fusion of two lipid bilayers in an aqueous environment requires that they come into close contact, which is associated with a significant energy barrier (Figure 1(a)\n). This process involves local membrane bending creating a first site of contact (Figure 1(b)). Complete dehydration of the initial contact site induces monolayer rupture that allows mixing of lipids from the two outer leaflets, resulting in a hemifusion stalk (Figure 1(c) and 1(d)). In a next step, the model predicts that radial expansion of the stalk leads to either direct fusion pore opening or to the formation of another intermediate, the hemifusion diaphragm, an extended bilayer connecting both membranes (Figure 1(e)). The hemifusion diaphragms that have been observed by electron microscopy and X-ray analysis of crystalline lipid phases provide evidence for stalk-like structures. Because the hemifusion diaphragm is a stable long-lived structure its formation could alternatively signify a dead end reaction. Fusion pore formation (Figure 1(f)), which is characterized by an initial opening and closing (\u2018flickering\u2019) of the pore, may be mediated by several factors such as lateral tension in the hemifusion stalk or bilayer and the curvature at the edges of the stalk or hemifusion state. Finally the fusion pore extends laterally until both membranes form a new extended lipid bilayer.",

Labeling techniques applied to in vitro liposome-based fusion assays allow discrimination between merging of lipid bilayers and content mixing thus visualizing subsequent steps in membrane fusion. Distinct steps in the fusion pathway can be further manipulated by lipids. Inverted cone-shaped lysophospholipids induce spontaneous positive bilayer curvature and inhibit hemifusion, while cone-shaped phosphatidylethanolamines induce negative curvature and promote hemifusion. In contrast, the lipid effect on the opening of the fusion pore is the opposite. Further support for the stalk model derives from electron microscopy images of influenza virus particles fusing with liposomes, which reveal structures resembling stalk intermediates.",

This produces a receptor binding subunit that is either covalently or non-covalently attached to the membrane fusion protein subunit, which anchors the heterotrimer to the viral membrane. The endoproteolytic cleavage positions a hydrophobic fusion peptide at or close to the N-terminus of the fusion domain. Subtilisin-like proteases recognize a conserved multibasic recognition sequence R-X-K/R-R or a monobasic cleavage site present in various glycoproteins. The nature of the cleavage site and its efficient cleavage (e.g., Influenza virus hemagglutinin) has been associated with pathogenicity. The multibasic recognition sequences present in Influenza virus HA, Simian parainfluenza virus F protein, HIV-1 gp160 and Ebola virus GP lead to mostly intracellular processing, whereas monobasic cleavage sites in Sendai virus F protein or Influenza virus HA are efficiently cleaved extracellularly, resulting in a more tissue restricted distribution of these viruses.",

The Ebola virus glycoprotein is not only processed by furin, but its glycoprotein subunit 1 (GP1) needs to be additionally cleaved by cathepsin proteases in the late endosome to activate its fusion potential during entry. Proteolytic glycoprotein cleavage generates in most cases a metastable glycoprotein structure that can switch into a more stable structure upon cellular receptor interaction or proton binding in the acidic environment of endosomes.

The HA1 domain, which contains the receptor binding domain, folds into a beta structure that binds sialic acid containing cellular receptors at the top of the molecule with relatively low millimolar affinity (Figure 2\n). Productive virus attachment to host target cells requires multivalency of binding to achieve sufficient affinity that triggers endocytosis and entry via the endosomal compartment. The type of sialic acid recognized by hemagglutinin is host specific. Human viruses generally interact with \u03b12-6-linked receptors and avian viruses, specific for \u03b12-3-linked glycans, need to adapt to humanlike receptors to overcome the species barrier. HA1 also interacts with the stem of the fusion domain HA2 in an extended conformation via its N- and C-termini. HA2 anchors hemagglutinin to the viral membrane and folds into a central triple-stranded coiled coil structure that is followed by a loop region and an anti-parallel helix, which extends towards the N-terminal fusion peptide that is buried within the trimer interface (Figure 2).",

(ii) Another dramatic change occurs towards the end of the central triple-stranded coiled coil, where a short fragment unfolds to form a reverse turn which positions a short helix anti-parallel against the central core. This chain reversal also repositions a \u03b2-hairpin and the extended conformation that leads to the transmembrane region (Figure 3\n).

The characteristic of all class I fusion protein core structures is their high thermostability suggesting that they represent the lowest energy state of the fusion protein. Secondly, they all contain a central triple-stranded coiled coil region with outer C-terminal anti-parallel layers that are either mostly helical or adopt extended conformations. The hallmark of the helical hairpin structure is the juxtaposition of the fusion peptide and of the transmembrane region at the same end of the rod-like structure. The post fusion structures are considered to be the product of conformational rearrangements in the native structure, as in case of influenza virus HA and Respiratory syncytia virus F (Figures 3 and 4\n). The fusion potential of most class I fusion proteins is generally activated by low pH or by direct interaction with cellular receptors. In contrast, most members of the Paramyxoviridae family require the concerted action of two glycoproteins. The receptor-binding protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), H or G binds to its cellular receptor and activates the fusion protein F via the stalk region as shown for Parainfluenza virus 5 receptor-binding protein HN.",

(1) Proteolytic cleavage activation transforms the glycoprotein into a metastable conformation. (2) Receptor binding induces conformational changes in the glycoprotein that lead to the exposure of the fusion peptide and its interactions with the target membrane (Figure 5(a)\nand 5(b)). Exposure of the fusion peptide seems to be the rate limiting step in the process. This generates a prehairpin intermediate structure that is, at least in case of HIV-1 and influenza virus fusion, long-lived. Consequently this extended intermediate conformation can be targeted by fusion inhibitors such as the HIV-1 specific T-20 peptide (Figure 5(b)). (3) Cooperativity of two or three glycoproteins is important at this stage, because it is thought to facilitate the refolding that leads to the apposition of the two membranes leading to lipid mixing. Fusion protein refolding occurs most likely fast and involves zipping up of the C-terminal region against the N-terminal coiled coil domain, ultimately forming the hairpin structure (Figure 5(c) and 5(d)). Refolding of the fusion protein is thought to control the formation of different intermediate bilayer structures such as the hemifusion stalk (Figure 5(d)), and/or a potential hemifusion diaphragm, followed by fusion pore opening and expansion (Figure 5(e)). It is assumed that membrane fusion occurs while the helical hairpin structure is formed and the core fusion protein structures represent postfusion conformations. Refolding of the fusion protein may produce stable intermediate structures, as suggested by the two low pH structures of influenza virus HA2. One indicates that most of the outer layer has not yet zipped up to form the hairpin structure (Figure 3, middle panel: the C-terminal ends could extend back to the lower membrane that anchors native HA (left panel)), while the other one reveals the extended conformation of the outer layer which forms - together with the N-terminal coiled coil - a stable N-capped structure (Figure 3, right panel). Such HA intermediates in fusion have been detected experimentally and stepwise refolding may lock the fusion process at distinct steps. The two membrane anchors, which are not present in any class I fusion glycoprotein structure, also play an active role in the fusion reaction. Replacement of the transmembrane region by a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor arrests influenza virus HA-driven fusion as well as HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein driven fusion at the hemifusion stage. Furthermore, the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of the fusion protein, which in case of HIV-1 gp41 is conserved and mostly hydrophobic, may insert into the viral membrane during the fusion process. Although some studies suggest that class I fusion proteins maintain their trimeric structure throughout the fusion process, others indicate that the trimer symmetry is first broken and later on reassembled from monomers that themselves may interact with membranes via their hydrophobic surfaces.",

NMR studies on the isolated Influenza virus hemagglutinin fusion peptide revealed a kinked helical structure and the Ebola virus Gp2 fusion loop was shown to adopt a fixed conformation, both of which are required for membrane fusion activity.

This rearrangement produces a hairpin-like structure with a similar functional architecture as class I fusion proteins (Figure 6, upper panel).

Firstly, the homo- or hetero-dimers dissociate from the membrane-parallel conformation (Figure 7(a)\n) in a reversible manner assuming monomeric conformations that likely expose their fusion loop to the target membrane (Figure 7(a\u2019)). The existence of this monomeric state of the glycoprotein is different from class I mediated fusion, although monomeric intermediates of class I fusion proteins have been debated. Fusion loop membrane interaction of monomers then triggers trimerization leading to an extended conformation. Trimerization is irreversible and tethers the fusion protein to the target membrane (Figure 7(b)). This structure is functionally comparable to the postulated prehairpin structure of class I fusion proteins such as HIV-1 gp41 (Figure 4(b)). Notably, both fusion intermediates can be targeted by either fusion protein peptides (T-20 in case of HIV-1 gp41) or recombinant fusion protein domains (such as the E3 domain in case of Tick-borne encephalitis virus), to block further glycoprotein refolding and thus membrane fusion. Subsequent additional refolding, namely the reorientation of domain I, pulls the two membranes into closer apposition that ultimately leads to the formation of a hemifusion stalk-like structure (Figure 7(c) and 7(d)). Finally complete zipping up of the C-terminal ends against the N-terminal core domains allows fusion pore opening and its expansion (Figure 7(e)). Similar to the case of class I fusion protein driven fusion, refolding is thought to provide the energy for fusion (Figure 7).",

This is sufficient to anchor the fusion protein to the host cell membrane. Further oligomerization of fusion loops, was suggested to induce local membrane deformation as postulated in the stalk model (Figures 1(c) and 7(c)).

The following conformational rearrangements have been suggested, based on the comparison of the native and the post fusion conformations. Considering the position of DIII as invariant, low pH projects the fusion domain DIV towards the target membrane by two movements: a 94\u00b0 rotation around a hinge region present between DIV and DIII. This arrangement could bridge both viral and target cell membranes.

Notably, artificial depletion of cholesterol from cells inhibits membrane fusion. Consistent with the role of cholesterol in membrane fusion, cholesterol-25-hydroxylase an innate immune factor that is upregulated by type I interferons, converts cholesterol to a soluble antiviral factor, 25-hydroxycholesterol and broadly inhibits membrane fusion of many enveloped viruses tested so far (class I: HIV, Influenza A virus, Ebola virus; class II: Rift Valley Fever Virus, Russian Spring-Summer Encephalitis virus and class III: Vesicular stomatitis virus, Herpes simplex virus, Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68, Murine Cytomegalovirus).",

            "text": "Structural biology has contributed considerably to understand the principles of protein driven membrane fusion reactions. A common principle is the refolding of the fusion protein conformation which leads to the apposition of viral and cellular membranes by placing their membrane anchors, the fusion peptide or loop and the transmembrane region at the same end of a rod-like structure upon completion of fusion. Bringing two membranes into close contact is energetically unfavorable and the role of the fusion protein is to overcome this energy barrier to facilitate lipid mixing, fusion pore opening and expansion. Therefore the fusion protein structures and their conformational transitions predict that the principles of membrane fusion are very similar for class I, II and III fusion proteins. Differences exist with regard to the conformations of the postulated intermediate fusion protein structures, their oligomeric states, the kinetics of refolding and the principles of fusion protein cooperativity, which require further work.",
