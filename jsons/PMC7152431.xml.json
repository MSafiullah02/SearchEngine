            "text": "Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, and are so named from the Greek orthos, meaning \u201cstraight\u201d and myxa, meaning \u201cmucus.\u201d The Orthomyoviridae family is composed of five genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus, and Isavirus (Fields et al., 2007). The genome of these viruses consists of 7\u20138 segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA contained within enveloped virus particles (virions) that are either spherical or filamentous in morphology (Levinson, 2006). The influenza viruses within this genera are categorized as A, B, or C, and differ in host range and severity of disease. Influenza types B and C primarily infect humans; however the severity of illness is relatively mild compared to influenza A viruses. Because influenza B and C remain predominantly within the human population, and neither exchanges genetic material between other influenza types, nor recombines genome segments naturally with viruses from other host species, influenza types B and C do not cause pandemics. In contrast, influenza A viruses infect a wide variety of mammals (including humans, horses, pigs, ferrets, cats, and dogs) as well as avian species. The ability of influenza A viruses to infect such a wide variety of host species that frequently come into close contact with one another permits the occurrence of co-infections with multiple influenza A viruses in permissive hosts that can serve as \u201cmixing vessels.\u201d These scenarios can result in the creation of genetic reassortant viruses that express novel antigenic properties, which can cause periodic epidemics in immunologically na\u00efve populations. In some cases these epidemics can spread rapidly and widely enough to be classified as a pandemic. The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic illustrates the emergence of a highly infectious reassortant strain which resulted when a previous triple reassortment of bird, pig, and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus (Trifonov et al., 2009) and rapidly spread across multiple continents.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are further divided into subtypes based on the antigenic nature of two important spike glycoproteins found in the host-derived lipid membrane which forms the virus envelope. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins project from the lipid envelope, along with the M2 protein. Influenza A virus subtypes are identified by the serotype of HA and NA expressed on the surface of the virion. There are 16 influenza virus HA types and nine NA subtypes (Fouchier et al., 2005). The HA molecule is involved in the attachment of the virus by binding neuraminic acids (also known as sialic acids) on the surface of host cells. The tropism of influenza A viruses that replicate in different species is at least partially explained by the preferential binding of certain HA molecules with sialic acids with specific linkages found in the penultimate galactose sugar of the sialic acid found on the cell surface. HA from human viruses selectively binds sialic acid residues with an \u03b12,6 linkage, while HA molecules from avian viruses selectively bind sialic acid residues with an \u03b12,3 linkage (Connor et al., 1994). Human tracheal epithelial cells contain a much higher ratio of \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid residues, while the epithelium lining the gut of ducks contains mostly \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid residues (Couceiro et al., 1993, Ito et al., 1998).",

            "text": "The HA glycoprotein exists as a precursor molecule (HA0) that relies on cleavage by cellular proteases in order to become biologically active (HA1 and HA2). Upon binding, influenza virus is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the resultant acidification of the endosome induces a conformational change in the HA molecule that triggers fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm (Klenk et al., 1975, Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975). This proteolytic activation of HA is essential for viral infectivity and dissemination, and is critical for virus pathogenicity (Webster and Rott, 1987). In many influenza viruses and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), the cleavage site in the HA0 molecule contains a single basic reside that is cleaved by trypsin-like enzymes found in the respiratory tract and limited organs, resulting in mild or asymptomatic infection. One of the virulence factors distinguishing highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) from LPAIV is the presence of multiple basic amino acids present at the cleavage site, which allows for cleavage of the HA0 molecule by ubiquitous intracellular proteases. The increased cleavability of the HA molecules of HPAIV in multiple tissue types results in systemic infection in avian species (Stieneke-Grober et al., 1992, Horimoto et al., 1994). These studies suggest that the ability to cleave HA is a determinant of the tissue tropism for avian influenza viruses and the differences in tissue tropism can determine the severity of disease outcome. It has been suggested that the HA molecule may play a role in neurovirulence in mammals (Mori et al., 2002), supported by studies in which a multibasic cleavage site has been cloned into low pathogenic viruses, and increasing virulence (Munster et al., 2010). The acquisition of natural forms of more cleavable HA may occur through polymerase slippage, mutations, reassortant events with coinfections, or non-homologous recombination events.",

            "text": "Influenza virus is transmitted primarily by inhalation and by direct contact inoculating the nasal mucosa, infecting epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract. Tropism for the upper respiratory tract of human seasonal influenza viruses (subtypes H1, H2, and H3) is determined by their preference for the 2,6-galactose-linked sialic acid receptor on ciliated cells. Tropism for the lower respiratory tract among avian strains (H5 and H7 subtypes) stems from preference for binding to the 2,3-gal receptor, particularly on mucin-secreting cells, and explains in part the more common primary viral pneumonia among avian influenza infections (Mastrosovich et al., 2006). Both types of receptor are distributed throughout the respiratory airways, however, and the swine-origin H1N1 pandemic strains are also complicated by primary viral pneumonia more often than seasonal H1N1 viruses. Seasonal, avian, and pandemic strains exhibit different replication efficiencies in airway epithelial cells, explaining in part the different virulence and transmission phenotypes (Mitchell et al., 2011). In uncomplicated influenza infection of nasal and upper-airway epithelial cells results in secretion of virus, cytokine and chemokine secretion, influx of neutrophils, and desquamation of apoptotic cells into the airways (Taubenberger and Morens, 2008). Symptoms are due to both the cytolytic viral infection and the cytokine response, suggested by the coincidence on day 2 of peak viral secretion, peak symptoms, and peak interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) secretion in volunteers (Hayden et al., 1998). Death is usually due to severe pulmonary infection as acute respiratory distress syndrome or primary viral pneumonia. In primary influenza pneumonia the virus replicates preferentially in ciliated airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and type I pneumocytes, although replication can occur in type II pneumocytes and non-ciliated epithelial cells (Kuiken and Taubenberger, 2008).",

Pathogenicity, defined as tissue injury and illness, originates from two interrelated features of the infection, the viral replication itself inducing epithelial cell death through the apoptosis program (Ludwig, 2006) and the subsequent host response with cytokine-driven mucosal and systemic inflammation. For example, the recently described viral protein PB1-F2 is proapoptotic, and the NS1 protein has been shown to have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activities. NS1 proteins from different strains antagonize type 1 IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 with different levels of efficiency, yet type 1 IFNs are also primary inducers of apoptosis. Thus the final consequence of these complex, often opposing, activities in regulating viral replication remains controversial.",

Epizootic strains infect swine, horses, dogs, cats, domestic poultry, and water birds, but only the avians often exhibit neurovirulent behavior. However, the mouse, ferret, guinea pig, and non-human primate have provided the most insight into pathogenesis. Animal models demonstrate that pulmonary inflammation is a direct consequence of infection of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages. Breakdown of the alveolar barrier function of the pneumocytes leads to alveolar flooding, influx of neutrophils and histiocytes, and plugging of small airways with desquamated cells. Nitric oxide and oxygen radicals play a significant role in pulmonary injury in a murine model of H2N2 infection (Akaike et al., 1996).",

Mouse microglia and astrocytes can be infected in vitro by both H1N1 and H5N1 subtypes and secrete proinflammatory proteins IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), with greater induction by H5N1 infection (Wang et al., 2008a). However, a porcine H1N1 virus adapted to a lethal strain for mice did not replicate in any neural or other extrapulmonary tissues (Garigliany et al., 2010). In the murine model of the neurovirulent WSN strain (evolved from the pandemic 1918 strain), it was not clear whether the encephalitis was a result of direct virus-induced apoptosis or was mediated by immunologic or inflammatory responses (Mori et al., 2003). In this model selected brainstem neurons are targeted after injection of virus into the olfactory bulb, and local defense is mediated by activated glial cells and apoptosis of infected neurons (Mori and Kimura, 2001). In the ferret model, the brain is invaded from the olfactory sensory cells in the nasal turbinates through the cribiform plate to the olfactory bulbs and thence to the basal ganglia (Shinya et al., 2011).",

The cytokines IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 have both antiviral and proinflammatory activity. Dysregulation of inflammation induced by the virus is associated with a lethal outcome but depends on the animal model. For example, in mice a lethal HPAI H5N1 strain was more pathogenic, including brain invasion, than the pandemic 1918 strain, and multiorgan dissemination correlated with early and sustained induction of inflammatory genes with active inhibition of the lipoxin-mediated anti-inflammatory response. In contrast, in the non-human primate, the 1918 strain was more pathogenic with early upregulation of cell death genes, inflammasome genes and IL-1\u03b2, whereas the H5N1 strain downregulated these genes. It must be kept in mind that viral replication rate with direct cytolytic injury also determine the clinical outcome and immunopathology in murine H5N1 infection (Hatta et al., 2010). Thus, the role of multiple determinants of pathogenesis remains complex, but the relationship between proinflammatory, cerebral metabolism, and regional brain function may offer future insights into encephalopathy (Semmler et al., 2008).",

The underlying problems include the lack of a clear, clean definition of EL. The term encephalitis was poorly defined in that era and the many arboviruses and other viruses that are now recognized to cause encephalitis were not known. In addition, many physicians during this period were untrained in neurologic diseases and how to perform a careful neurologic exam. As such, many of the clinical descriptions of EL are vague. This wide variation in clinical features suggests that several different etiologies of illnesses were lumped together as EL.",

However, many countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, were describing similar cases in the fall of 1918 and in 1919. Reports from New York City noted the cases paralleled the 1918 influenza pandemic. The most careful study came from a review of cases reported in Seattle, Washington, and in Samoa (Ravenholt and Foege, 1982). The authors identified 142 EL deaths as well as deaths related to influenza/pneumonia during 1918 through 1926. There was an association with the 1918 influenza but the EL cases clustered about 12 months after each of three waves. The hospital death records of the EL cases did not mention whether the individuals had experienced infection from the 1918 influenza months earlier. The authors also reviewed death records from both Western Samoa and American Samoa. In Western Samoa, the 1918 influenza hit the island in November 1918 and cases of EL appeared over the next few years and disappeared. However, American Samoa had a quarantine and developed no cases of influenza or EL. Finally, the authors presented reported cases of EL from Sweden and Switzerland that clearly demonstrated high peaks of EL that correspond to late 1919 or 1920 and followed shortly after their peaks of influenza.",

Experimental with strains of human influenza virus, pathology identical to EL has not been seen in experimental animals. However, some of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strains demonstrate somewhat similar brain pathology in animals (see end of chapter). The unusually long delay of 6 months or more for the appearance of EL after the 1918 influenza hit a city is difficult to explain. Many reports of acute EL patients did not report that the patients previously experienced influenza. However, the lack of a clear association of EL with a prior influenza infection may be due to the fact that patients rarely sought medical attention for influenza and may not have suffered a severe case of influenza. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence that EL never developed in patients during their acute influenza infection. Finally, McCall and others (2001) failed to detect influenza RNA in archival brain tissues from acute EL.",

It is unlikely that EL occurred as a direct complication in a patient with the 1918 influenza. However, a postinfectious influenza complication has not been ruled out.

In a series by Duvoisin and Yahr (1965) from New York City, the mean age of onset of 31 patients who had a reliable history of EL was 29 years, compared to 57 years for cases of classical Parkinson's disease. Similarly, Dimsdale (1946) reviewed 320 cases of parkinsonism diagnosed in the United Kingdom from 1900 to 1942. Of the 100 cases from 1920 to 1930, two-thirds appeared to follow EL. The modal age of onset was in the third decade. The PEP cases could immediately follow EL or develop up to 19 years later but most sought medical attention within 2 years of EL. In both series, atypical features for Parkinson's disease were common and included oculogyric crises, ocular nerve abnormalities (abnormal external ocular movement, pupillary irregularities, poor accommodation), excessive salivation, and marked somnolence. Some patients also had hemiparesis, dystonia, chorea, tics, bulbar palsies, and behavioral disturbances.",

The influenza A infection could be associated with either the A H3N2 or H1N1 strain. Temporal and geographic associations between influenza B and RS outbreaks were repeatedly described (Johnson et al., 1963, Glick et al., 1970, Reynolds et al., 1972, Linnemann et al., 1975, Corey et al., 1976, Nelson et al., 1979).",

In severe cases, widespread cortical neuronal degeneration and large myelin blebs occur. Inflammation is absent and viral particles or inclusion bodies are not seen. The liver in all stages is slightly swollen and increased in weight for the age of the patient. Liver biopsies show several characteristic changes. On frozen histologic sections, lipid is abundant and uniformly distributed. Hepatocyte cytoplasm is distended by microvesicular fat droplets (Schubert et al., 1972, Svoboda and Reddy, 1975). On paraffin-embedded sections stained with hemotoxylin and eosin, there is little cytoplasmic vacuolation early but later there is a uniform foaminess of the cytoplasm. Inflammation is rare. By electron microscopy, hepatocytes show microvesicular fat droplets and prominent morphologic changes in mitochondria (Partin et al., 1971, Bove et al., 1975). The mitochondria often measured 2\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter with the outer membrane deformed by deep cytoplasmic invaginations and normal-appearing cristae. Liver biopsies obtained weeks to months after recovery appear almost normal. The kidney may also demonstrate lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of cells of the loop of Henle and proximal convoluted tubules. The myocardium occasionally also demonstrates lipid accumulation and abnormal mitochondria.",

Use of mannitol intravenously was beneficial for 1\u20132 days but the serum osmolality level needed to be kept below 320 mOsmol/L.

In addition to the acute influenza viral infection, there is strong epidemiologic evidence that taking aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) early in the influenza predisposed to developing RS (Hurwitz et al., 1985, Hurwitz et al., 1987). There was no evidence that these children were given excessive amounts of aspirin as the trigger. However, the aspirin and influenza correlation with RS was not close to one to one. Many children were reported who developed RS associated with influenza but had no exposure to aspirin. Two retrospective studies found that aspirin was given to the majority of children with flu symptoms that did not develop RS (71% and 74%) (Halpin et al., 1982, Waldman et al., 1982). Nevertheless, when warnings against children taking aspirin when developing a flu-like symptoms were widely circulated in the mid-1980s, the incidence of RS dramatically fell (Remington et al., 1986). By the early 1990s, RS around the world was rare.",

Second, acetylsalicylic acid was widely administered to children with fevers and flu symptoms since the early 1900s and was widely used even during the 1918, 1958, and 1964 influenza pandemics. Third, acetaminophen was marketed in 1956 and ibuprofen marketed in 1969 (just before the RS epidemic) and given to children with influenza, but neither has been associated with RS. Fourth, clear dose\u2013response curves for aspirin have not been established for RS. The current argument is that any aspirin consumption can trigger RS in susceptible individuals.

Mouse models similar to RS have been developed in which juvenile mice given intravenous influenza B virus develop many of the clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features of RS 1\u20133 days later (Henle and Henle, 1946, Davis et al., 1983, Davis et al., 1993, Davis and Kornfeld, 1986). The mice developed elevated arterial serum ammonia, transaminase elevated levels, and hypoglycemia. The animals became lethargic, often developed seizures, and died. Microvesicular fatty degeneration was present throughout the liver with mitochondrial abnormalities seen on electron microscopy that was similar to that seen in human RS livers. The brain demonstrated cerebral edema by light and electron microscopy as well as biochemical studies. No inflammation was seen in the liver or brain but was present in the trachea. No virus was isolated in the liver or brain but virus could be isolated from the respiratory tract. However, viral antigens by immunoperoxidase staining were detected in liver hepatocytes and cerebral endothelial cells. Influenza RNA was also detected in the brain and liver. Thus the liver and brain were non-permissive influenza viral infections while the trachea infection was permissive and produced virions. The addition of aspirin to the mouse model did not increase mortality (Davis et al., 1985).",

Clinically, RS does not occur at the peak of the influenza but rather as the patient is beginning to recover. Although influenza virus can be isolated often from other tissues such as the nasopharynx or lungs, it is rare for the virus to be isolated from blood, liver, or brain by conventional techniques (Noble et al., 1975, LaMontagne, 1980). Liver and brain biopsies examined by electron microscopy have not identified any budding influenza virus-like particles. Unfortunately, PCR techniques and other nucleic acid technology were not available then that would have been more sensitive. There have been no subsequent reports studying stored RS tissues using these technologies. Limited clinical laboratory studies indicated that no particular strain of influenza virus caused RS. The pathologic findings in the liver and brain do not suggest viral encephalitis or hepatitis. Thus, how influenza virus may have caused RS remains a mystery. In a later section, current theories of the pathogenesis of many of the neurologic complications of influenza will be discussed.",

Before then, no causal relationship between GBS and influenza vaccination had been epidemiologically documented and few cases after vaccination had been reported (Hurwitz et al., 1981). In response to a perceived threat that the Hsw1N1 strain was similar to the 1918 pandemic strain, 40 million adults were vaccinated with a rapidly produced killed swine influenza vaccine. As the vaccination program proceeded, it became recognized that cases of GBS started appearing. Beginning about the second week after vaccination, a sharp rise in GBS cases occurred that peaked in the third week, followed by a fairly rapid decline that extended a total of 6 weeks (Langmuir, 1979, Schonberger et al., 1979, Marks and Halpin, 1980). Since children under the age of 18 were not recommended for vaccination, few GBS cases developed in that age group. Compared to unvaccinated individuals who developed GBS, the increased relative risk rose to 12.7 per 1000 vaccinees for ages 25\u201344 years, 7.1 for ages 45\u201364, and 5.6 for ages over age 65 years (Langmuir, 1979). In all, there were 500 cases of GBS occurring among vaccinated persons, with 25 deaths. For all age groups, the rate for vaccinated cases was 7.3 and for unvaccinated cases 0.77, giving a ratio or relative risk of 9.5 to 1 or an increase of one case of GBS for every 100 000 adult vaccinations (Haber et al., 2009).",

In a series of 316 cases reviewed from the literature, the myositis usually developed in school-aged children (mean age of 8 years) with a 2:1 male predominance (Agyeman et al., 2004). About three-quarters of the infections were attributed to influenza B virus. The mean interval of myositis from onset of influenza symptoms was 3 days. The calf muscles were usually involved, with 69% being the only muscle group involved and 31% having calf and other muscles involved. The gastrocnemius is commonly tender to palpation (75%) and could have a mild swelling but the overlying skin was seldom warm to the touch or red. Walking is difficult and usually done with a limp. If both calves are involved, the child often refuses to walk. Serum creatine kinase is always elevated but rhabdomyolysis and renal failure occur in only 3%. The outcome is excellent, with symptoms of focal pain resolving in a median of 3 days. No studies have demonstrated that administration of anti-influenza drugs is effective in shortening the duration of the myopathy.",

In a summary of 28 biopsy specimens, all showed degeneration and necrosis but six specimens showed no inflammation (Agyeman et al., 2004). The degeneration was quite focal and patchy. Frank hemorrhages did not develop. Attempts to isolate influenza virus from the muscle biopsy have varied. Often the isolation attempt was unsuccessful (Greco et al., 1977, Schlesinger et al., 1978) but influenza A or B virus has been isolated from several patients (Partin et al., 1976, Gamboa et al., 1979, Kessler et al., 1980, Kessler et al., 1983). In addition, an immunohistochemical study from a muscle biopsy of a symptomatic patient demonstrated influenza viral antigen within myofibers often in a segmental pattern (Gamboa et al., 1979). Muscle fibers at the periphery of a bundle appeared to have more viral antigen than those that were central.",

Microscopic studies demonstrated segments of the muscle fiber with degeneration within the fiber and inflammation in the perimysium surrounding muscle fascicles.

The severity of the myalgia correlates with the severity of the influenza respiratory symptoms and with the titer of influenza virus shed from the nasopharynx (Hall et al., 1979). Children and occasional adults can develop a focal degeneration of mainly leg muscles that often demonstrates segmental involvement in muscle fibers. It is postulated that the respiratory infection results in a transient viremia (Naficy, 1963, Stanley and Jackson, 1966) that somehow localizes to calf muscles, producing mainly a non-permissive localized myopathy with limited inflammation. However, the occurrence of myositis did not correlate with the quantities of virus shed in the nasopharynx (Hall et al., 1979).",

The necrotic tissue was phagocytosed by macrophages and degenerating cardiocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes were in close contact (Kotaka et al., 1990). Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated viral antigen in endothelial cells and cardiocytes until day 7. Cultured neonatal primary rat heart muscle infected with influenza virus demonstrated viral antigen in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the muscle cells but no virion production was observed, suggesting the infection was non-permissive (Suciu et al., 1985).",

Febrile seizures are defined as a seizure in children aged 6 months to 5 years associated with fever but without evidence of intracranial infection or other definable cause (Chiu et al., 2001). In one series of 73 children hospitalized for febrile seizures, a viral cause was thought to be responsible in 86% (Lewis et al., 1979). Published series have determined that several common viruses are associated with febrile seizures and include influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rotavirus (Chung and Wong, 2007). In series of hospital visits for febrile seizures, about 20% are associated with influenza (Chiu et al., 2001, Chung and Wong, 2007). The majority had a single uncomplicated partial or generalized seizure but 20\u201333% had more complex seizures that could be prolonged for more than 15 minutes, multiple seizures occurring within 24 hours, or postictal impairment of consciousness lasting for more than 30 minutes (Chung and Wong, 2007). Patients with febrile seizure should not have abnormalities on their EEG or neuroimaging and at discharge should be normal. In a series of 842 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 72 (0.9%) developed neurologic complications (Newland et al., 2007). Seizures were the reason for admission in 56 (58%) and febrile seizures in 27 of the 56 (48%). Whether influenza virus triggers a seizure simply by causing a childhood fever or whether there are other factors involved is unclear.",

            "text": "There is increasing interest that the encephalopathy associated with the respiratory influenza infection may be due to several cytokines. However, production of proinflammatory cytokines is a normal defense mechanism in an influenza infection. A comprehensive study of 20 normal volunteers who were nasally infected with influenza A Texas/36/91 (H1N1) virus were serially followed with nasal and serum cytokine levels which correlated with symptoms and nasal viral titers (Hayden et al., 1998). Influenza virus infection and replication in the respiratory tract directly injure the nasal and tracheobronchial epithelium. The resulting loss of respiratory epithelial cells is a major reason for several symptoms accompanying the infection, such as cough, depressed tracheobronchial clearance, and altered pulmonary function. Influenza virus induces a cascade of host immune responses leading to mucosal inflammation and the influx of polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages into the respiratory tract. It is this immune response that is responsible for resolution of the infection and possibly the clinical systemic symptoms. In the volunteer study, virus was recovered from nasal washes beginning on day 1, peaking on day 2 and persisting up to day 7. Peak influenza virus titers on day 2 were about 103.7 50% tissue culture infectious doses per mL. The patient temperature also peaked on day 2. Respiratory and systemic symptoms, such as fever, headache, and myalgias, also peaked on day 2 and persisted to about day 6. Two cytokines, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1, peaked in the nasal washes and serum on day 2 but serum TNF-\u03b1 peaked on day 4. Serum IL-6 levels were about fourfold above normal. Plasma and serum IL-6 levels nicely correlated with total systemic symptoms on days 2\u20134. Considerable evidence finds that the cytokines studied were produced locally in the respiratory tract by both infected respiratory epithelial cells and immune invading cells. Another study reported similar findings (Kaiser et al., 2001). Thus, several cytokines appear responsible for both clearance of the respiratory infection and production of common influenza systemic symptoms.",

Studies of patients with encephalopathy have reported very elevated serum and/or CSF elevated levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, and TNF-\u03b1, and soluble TNF receptor (Ichiyama et al., 2003b, To et al., 2010). Furthermore, when patients were divided into categories ranging from simple respiratory illness, to febrile seizures, and encephalopathy, those with the encephalopathy generally had the highest serum levels (Ichiyama et al., 1998, Ichiyama et al., 2004, Kawada et al., 2003, Ito et al., 1999, Fukumoto et al., 2007). Individuals with ANE often, but not always, had extremely elevated serum and CSF levels of IL-6 (Yoshikawa et al., 2001, Ichiyama et al., 2003a, Okumura et al., 2009). Thus, there was a correlation between very elevated serum cytokine levels and poor outcome from death or neurologic sequelae. The viral pneumonia complicating the pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection is a primary source of elevated cytokine production (To et al., 2010).",

Second, avian influenza strains of subtype H5 were never recognized in humans until 1997 during a small outbreak in Hong Kong. Evolution of these strains through mutation resulted in greater viral replication efficiency in mammalian cells (Twu et al., 2007). Subsequently explosive spread of avian influenza began in 2004 and within 2 years had spread throughout Asia with extension to Europe and Africa. Multiple clades of H5N1 viruses have evolved over the last dozen years (Chen et al., 2006), complicating the prediction of suitable vaccines. Although the immediate source of infection is usually not identified, contact with domestic poultry has been a constant association with human infection and epizootics of avian flu in domestic fowl have led to the destruction of millions of birds. Low pathogenic influenza viruses are enzootic in feral water fowl but introduction into domestic poultry appears to accelerate adaptation, virulence, and high levels of aerosol transmission among crowded flocks (Lebarbenchon et al., 2010). H7 and H9 subtypes have also infected humans but the disease is in general mild and not thought to represent a pandemic threat.",

CNS infection is well described in many bird species, with infection of neurons and microglial cells documented (Vascellari et al., 2007). Mouse microglia and astrocytes bear both the \u03b1-2,3-gal and \u03b1-2,6-gal receptors and are productively infected in vitro by both human and avian viruses (Wang et al., 2008b). Extrapulmonary dissemination is characteristic of H5N1 infection in mice (Gao et al., 1999). Note that H5N1 viruses display a predilection for binding to the \u03b1-2,3-galactose-linked sialic acid receptors found predominantly in human lower respiratory tract mucosal epithelial cells (Shinya et al., 2006). Thus it is recommended that in early infection diagnosis is better achieved from specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract (Zhang et al., 2010).",

In the mouse model several routes of entry of the virus into the brain have been suggested. Intranasal inoculation of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus appeared to enter via the mesenteric and myenteric plexi of the enteric nervous system prior to appearing in the brainstem nuclei (Jang et al., 2009). Inoculation with a dose lethal to half the mice resulted in large weight loss, ataxia, tremor, and bradykinesia in all the animals. This study also found that, among survivors examined 90 days after infection, neuronal loss, abnormal protein aggregations, and microglial activation were prominent, all hallmarks of the neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",

The majority of ferrets exhibit severe neurologic signs, including hemiparesis, convulsions, torticollis, and spasticity prior to death (Rowe et al., 2003). High levels of cytokine secretion are found in mouse (Lipatov et al., 2005, Szretter et al., 2007) and ferret (Cameron et al., 2008) models. However, in view of the extensive regions of necrosis in all lobes of the ferret brain in sites of replicating virus, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meningoencephalitis is due primarily to the cytolytic viral replication.",

The few postmortem studies have not yet been able to elucidate thoroughly the pathogenesis of this severe disease, but available data have been summarized in detail (Gambotto et al., 2008, Korteweg and Gu, 2008). Most deaths have occurred in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia and are usually due to acute respiratory death syndrome (Kawachi et al., 2009) and well-described cases do not include neurologic symptoms and signs (Hien et al., 2004). In a study of a 6-year-old boy who died of acute respiratory distress syndrome on the 17th day of illness, viral RNA and antigen were not detected in the brain or trachea but were detected in spleen, large and small intestine, and lung tissue, where it was restricted to the type II alveolar pneumocyte (Uiprasertkul et al., 2005). Positive-strand viral RNA was restricted to the lung and intestine, indicating that viral replication was occurring in only these two organs. Viral dissemination was found in another patient by immunohistochemical demonstration of viral antigen in bone marrow, glial cells, and neurons in the brain and in lymphocytes, but viral replication by culture was found only in the lung and upper respiratory tract (Zhang et al., 2009). In a careful study of two adults and a fetus, viral antigen and viral RNA by in situ hybridization with sense and antisense probes was detected in type II alveolar epithelial cells, ciliated and non-ciliated tracheal cells, T cells of the lymph node, neurons in the brain, and cytotrophoblasts of the placenta (Gu et al., 2007). This widespread dissemination of replicating virus was confirmed by strand-specific RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification H5 detection assays, yet despite the evidence for viral replication in the brain, there was no histopathologic evidence for inflammation in the brain.",

In 18 individuals with H5N1 infection the low blood T lymphocyte counts and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were correlated with high pharyngeal viral loads and detection of viral RNA in blood and rectum, particularly in fatal cases (de Jong et al., 2006). Although suppression of the host inflammatory response may confer some therapeutic benefit, anecdotal experience with corticosteroids did not improve the clinical outcome in H5N1 infection (Oner et al., 2006). In a murine model study anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies reduced illness severity (Hussell et al., 2001), suggesting more exploration of this strategy.",
