Given the foundations of B in set theory and logic, and given that the Unicode syntax of B is identical to or very close to standard mathematical notation, our tool can also be used to produce notebooks for teaching mathematical foundations in general or theoretical computer science in particular.

Originally it was developed under the name IPython Notebook and only supported Python-based notebooks, but it has since been extended to allow using languages other than Python. Support for each language is provided by a Jupyter kernel : a languagespecific backend that receives input from Jupyter Notebook, processes it using the target language, and returns the results to Jupyter. Jupyter communicates with kernels using a language-agnostic protocol, which allows implementing kernels in languages other than Python. In the case of ProB, the kernel was implemented in Java, as ProB provides a high-level Java API [1] , and there is an existing Java implementation of the Jupyter kernel protocol by the jupyter-jvmbasekernel project [7] .",

A related issue is that of traceability, tracing natural language requirements to the formal model. In that setting the idea of literate programming [5] , mixing the natural language documentation with the program, is appealing. The Z language [8] has always allowed literate programming by interleaving L A T E X commands with Z constructs. A similar capability for the B language is provided by ProB's L A T E X mode [6] . In comparison, the ProB Jupyter kernel focuses more on interactivity. Individual cells of a B notebook can be quickly edited and re-rendered/evaluated, whereas the ProB L A T E X mode can only render the entire document at once. However, the ability to write L A T E X code directly offers more flexibility in terms of formatting and layout, compared to a B notebook converted to L A T E X or PDF using nbconvert.",
