The present study aimed to evaluate the survival of NDV live vaccine strain immersed in 5 pH-amended water samples (pH 5.00, pH 6.00, pH 7.00, pH 8.00, and pH 9.00) by sequential determination of virus infectivity on Vero cells for 3 hours.

Maximum reduction of infectivity was observed in the water with pH 9.00 in which the virus was completely inactivated within 3 hours. Addition of stabilizers (Cevamune R or skimmed milk) slightly altered the pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the virus-charged water samples.

Trend lines show a minimum decline at pH 7.00, while an abrupt decline was observed at extreme acidic (pH 5.00) or alkaline (pH 9.00) pH conditions. For a better comparison of virus inactivation rates for all treatments, T-90 values were calculated (Table 4 ). In all types of water samples, T-90 values at pH 7.00 are significantly higher than all of the other pH conditions. The Cevamune R -added, virus-charged water sample adjusted to pH 7.00 displayed a maximum T-90 value (485 \u00b1 64 min). The addition of Cevamune R or skimmed milk in water at pH 8.00 resulted in significantly higher T-90 values than the water without stabilizers at pH 8.00 or the water with or without stabilizers at pH 5.00, 6.00, and 9.00 ( Table 3 ). The Nestle bottled water has a pH of 7.37 and a TDS value of 244 PPM. A negligible change was observed in the pH and TDS values of the viruscharged water samples following the addition of Cevamune R or skimmed milk (Tables 2 and 3 ) except at acidic conditions in which the addition of skimmed milk slightly raised the pH values of pH 5.00 and 6.00 adjusted water samples to 5.69 \u00b1 0.04 and 6.49 \u00b1 0.03, respectively. Lentogenic strains of NDV are universally used as live virus vaccines in domestic and commercial poultry. These vaccines are administered through conventional routes that include aerosol (spraying), drinking water, and eye drops. However, due to cost and convenience, administration of NDV vaccines is mostly performed through the drinking water route. The efficacy of NDV live vaccines is highly dependent upon the infectivity of the vaccine virus, which can be lost by improper cold-chain management and inadequate storage conditions [20] . The presence of a virus-inactivating substance in the water also may lead to vaccine failures [21] . A model virus system was developed in the present study to evaluate the effect of water pH on the survival of the LaSota strain of NDV. However, due to identical virus morphology, the experimental findings might be applicable to other virus strains as well. It was observed that extreme pH conditions (5.00 and 9.00) negatively affect virus survival rates. At a neutral pH (7.00), a negligible decrease in the virus titer was recorded, while this effect was more pronounced at pH 6.00 and 8.00 (Table 1, Figure 1 ). Previous studies on the environmental inactivation of viruses show that the pH of the medium primarily affects virus infectivity. It was observed that at low pH, enveloped viruses display conformational changes in their spike glycoproteins, which distort their ability to bind the cell surface receptors [22] . An Orthomyxovirus was completely inactivated by exposure to pH 4.00 for 30 min, while infectivity was reduced by more than 90% at pH 11 im-mediately after exposure [23] . The present study also demonstrates that extreme acidic (pH 5.00) or alkaline (pH 9.00) conditions were detrimental to virus infectivity (Table 1) . Similarly, while testing various natural water sources as a diluent of live NDV vaccines, the ones with acidic pH induced minimum antibody titers in the vaccinated birds [24] , indicating a negative effect on the efficacy of that vaccine. In all of the experiments, the same virus stock with equivalent biological activity was used, but virus-charged water samples adjusted to extreme pH conditions displayed low infectivity titers in comparison to the ones with neutral pH values at the beginning of the experiment. This shows that extreme pH conditions resulted in drastic virus inactivation (Table  1 ). In the case of Cevamune R -and skimmedmilk-added samples, this trend was relatively less. Despite the fact that the addition of commercial stabilizer or skimmed milk did not have any effect on water pH, the high protein content of skimmed milk may have protected the virus from the damaging effects of extreme pH conditions [25] . Skimmed milk proved to contain better stabilizing properties for administration of live bacterial and viral vaccines [26] , especially for the drinking water vaccine regimen of infectious bronchitis and NDV vaccines of poultry [2, 27] . Likewise, Cevamune R increases virus survival in water, as it neutralizes chlorine and other water sanitizers as well as binds heavy metals that may be present in the water [28] . In a biological system, it was not possible to maintain the initial virus concentration at the same level, as several other factors such as pH may have resulted in an abrupt change in virus infectivity. This is why, for better comparison of the virus survival rates, a measure of 90% reduction in virus infectivity (T-90 value) was used. At a neutral pH (7.00), the highest T-90 values (around 8 h) were recorded. All of the experiments were conducted at ambient temperature (25 \u2022 C \u00b1 02), and the decrease in virus infectivity even at pH 7.00 may be attributed to the effect of temperature, as virus infectivity can be measured in h at 20 \u2022 C [29] . Temperature-based inactivation of a Metapneumovirus (Paramyxoviridae) in 24 h duration was reported to be one and 2 log10 reduction at 21 and 37 \u2022 C, respectively [30]. In a study by Nazir et al. [7] , it took 8 d for one log10 reduction in the infectivity of NDV at 20 \u2022 C, which is quite higher than the time calculated in the present study. In the study by Nazir et al., avian influenza virus was adsorbed onto germ carriers. It is known that adsorbed virus particles have a higher survival rate than the suspended virus particles in the same medium [7, 31] . Statistical analysis shows that the addition of Cevamune R or skimmed milk did not have any significant effect on the survival of the virus in the water adjusted to 5.00, 6.00, or 9.00 pH, while in the water with pH 7.00 and 8.00, virus survival was significantly increased after adding either Cevamune R or skimmed milk (Table 4 ). This is in line with the findings of a previous study [25] in which dried skimmed milk helped to stabilize the NDV vaccine virus in containers and water pipes. In the present study, the role of only 2 water-quality parameters, i.e., pH and salinity, was tested, but under field-like conditions, several other factors, such as heavy metals, chlorine, or disinfectants in the water, organic matter, and microbial biofilms in storage tanks or water distribution systems, also may affect virus survival rates. Therefore, the role of all these factors needs to be evaluated before drawing a final conclusion about the role of water quality in the effective delivery of the live NDV vaccines through drinking.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1863, "end": 1867, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1968, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2791, "end": 2795, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2962, "end": 2966, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3288, "end": 3292, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 4049, "end": 4053, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4173, "end": 4177, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4283, "end": 4286, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 4287, "end": 4290, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4466, "end": 4470, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 5117, "end": 5121, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 5307, "end": 5323, "text": "Nazir et al.
