A decision to not pursue invasive mechanical ventilation may be reflected in the patient\u2019s medical record with a do-not-intubate (DNI) order. Decisions to pursue DNI may occur at any point in a patient\u2019s medical course\u2014in the outpatient setting, on the medical ward or emergency department, or when the patient has respiratory failure in the ICU. Such decisions may be revisited when the patient\u2019s diagnosis, prognosis, or goals of medical treatment change.",

Placement of DNI orders and thus withholding of invasive mechanical ventilation may facilitate delivery of treatment that is in agreement with patient preferences and goals [5]. Notwithstanding, more than half of all patients with acute respiratory failure who receive noninvasive ventilation and also have a DNI order survive to hospital discharge\u2014often with no worse quality of life compared to those without a DNI order [4].",

Methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by 2 authors using a modified Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies (Supplemental Table 2) [11]. Pooled estimates were generated using random effects meta-analyses with variance stabilization using the Freeman Turkey double arcsine method [12]. I2 was used to estimate variation across studies attributable to heterogeneity. I2 ranges from 0 to 100% with low I2 representing low heterogeneity [13].

Studies were conducted in North America (n = 6), Europe (n = 12), and Asia (n = 8). Mean/median age of patients ranged from 50 to 82 years. Studies treated patients in the ICU, respiratory care units, hospital wards, emergency departments or a combination of these settings. Studies described patients who utilized noninvasive ventilation (n = 17), high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (n = 8) or both (n = 1). Nineteen studies recruited patients with acute respiratory failure of any cause. Seven studies reported results of DNI in cancer patients only. The methodological quality of included studies was high in 9 studies and low in 17 studies (Supplemental Table 3). Sources of low methodological quality included poor sample representativeness (single center studies only), small sample size, no clear distinction between patients with DNI orders and comfort measure only orders, and limited description of the decision making process for DNI orders.",

First, 1 in 4 patients who utilize noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula for acute respiratory failure has a DNI order. Second, there is high inter-study variability in published rates of DNI orders, even when accounting for factors such as age, country, and illness severity. Third, there is high variability in the reported decision-making processes of individual studies to determine DNI. Fourth, few studies reported differences in rates of DNR and DNI\u2014even though chances for recovery are better for acute respiratory failure compared with cardiac arrest.

Characteristics of patients, families, physicians, and hospitals (including ethical climates, implementation of advance care planning, as well as availability of ICU beds and ventilators) also play important roles [7, 8, 43\u201358]. A recent global analysis of clinicians\u2019 views on ethical aspects of withholding and withdrawing life support showed that although there are important differences between countries and hospitals within a country, the largest differences are accounted for by differences between individual clinicians within a hospital [40]. Increasing rates of DNI orders over the past 20 years may reflect increased focus on high quality end-of-life care, changing ethical climates [55, 56], or increased recognition of the utility of noninvasive ventilation in patients who are not candidates for intubation. Higher rates of DNI orders in Europe and Asia (compared to North America) could also reflect these same principles (e.g., increased physician anticipation of end-of-life).",

Therefore, it is important to evaluate DNI orders in the context other potential treatment limitations such as DNR orders or orders to stop all life-prolonging treatments such as antibiotics, dialysis, surgery, etc. (\u201ccomfort measures only\u201d). Shared decision making, a collaborative decision-making process involving both physician and patient/family input, has been endorsed by a panel of experts from 32 countries worldwide [59]. Nevertheless, integration of shared decision making into practice is variable and there are few tools to help clinicians, patients, and families. In some settings, written DNI orders may not accurately reflect patient wishes\u2014as some patients with written DNI orders may actually prefer a trial of intubation as long as the ventilator would be withdrawn if intubation becomes prolonged [60]. Nevertheless, in countries where life support withdrawal may be culturally unacceptable or even illegal, there may be a greater tendency to avoid intubation altogether.",

Fourth, we presented observational data only and did not evaluate the association of DNI status or treatments used on clinical outcomes. Fifth, study results may not generalize to institutions, where such epidemiological studies have not been performed. Sixth, DNI rates may be different in patients who were not receiving noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen.

Future considerations also include evaluating the impact of DNI orders and treatments (e.g., noninvasive ventilation) on short- and long-term outcomes when adjusted for individual patient characteristics, as well as the development and testing of interventions to improve DNI decision making. Truly understanding DNI variability across continents can only be achieved by benchmarking long-term outcomes in patients with and without DNI orders across geographical regions, cultures, and ethical climates.",
