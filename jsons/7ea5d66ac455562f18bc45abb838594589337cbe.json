During such outbreaks, understanding the emotional state of citizens of a country could be of interest to various organizations to carry out tasks and to take necessary measures. Several studies have been performed on data available on various social media platforms and websites to understand the emotions of people against many events, inclusive of Covid-19, across the world. Twitter and other social media platforms have been bridging the gap between the citizens and government in various countries and are of more prominence in India. Sentiment Analysis of posts on twitter is observed to accurately reveal the sentiments. Analysing real time posts on twitter in India during Covid-19, could help in identifying the mood of the nation. However, most of the existing studies related to Covid-19, on twitter and other social media platforms are performed on data posted during a specific interval. We are not aware of any research that identifies emotional state of India on a daily basis. Hence, we present a web portal that aims to display mood of India during Covid-19, based on real time twitter data. This portal also enables users to select date range, specific date and state in India to display mood of people belonging to the specified region, on the specified date or during the specified date range. Also, the number of Covid-19 cases and mood of people at specific cities and states on specific dates is visualized on the country map. As of May 6 2020, the web portal has about 194370 tweets, and each of these tweets are classified into seven categories that include six basic emotions and a neutral category. A list of Trigger Events are also specified, to allow users to view the mood of India on specific events happening in the country during Covid-19.",

            "text": "Covid-19 pandemic has been severely affecting many countries across the world. The severity of the pandemic is growing very fast across the world. In India, the number of Covid-19 cases have greatly increased, from 724 cases to around 29K cases, in a span of one month, from 28 March, 2020 to 28 April, 2020. The total number of deaths reported in the country have increased from 17 on 28 March, 2020 to 934 on 28 April, 2020. There has been a growth rate of more than 100%, both in view of number of cases and number of deaths in the country, in a span 10 days. Increased number of cases being reported, from around 14K to around 29K and deaths from 480 to 934, indicate the rapid growth of the pandemic in the country (from 18 April, 2020 to 28 April, 2020). It has been observed that the sudden outrages of such pandemics affect public emotion and result in either constructive or destructive behavioural changes [Hou, Du, Jiang, Zhou, and Lin (2020) ]. Human behavior has been observed to play an important role in either controlling or scaling up spread of a disease, and is more prominent in case of highly contagious pandemics [Siegrist and Zingg (2014) ]. The most common emotions witnessed among the people during several pandemics and crisis situations are fear and anger [Lin, Savoia, Agboola, and Viswanath (2014) ] [Vaughan and Tinker (2009) ]. Though fear is observed as a basic instinct during the onset of unexpected situations involving danger, researchers also warn that excessive fear results in anxiety disorders, intensifying psychiatric disorders [Garcia (2017) ]. Also, such psychiatric disorders and anxiety might lead to cardiovascular disorders among the vulnerable population [Shin and Liberzon (2010) ]. Mental health should hence be considered as an important part of pandemic response [Douglas, Douglas, Harrigan, and Douglas (2009) ]. Lack of proper guidance to face the pandemic situation might sometimes result in acute fear, leading to self harm intentions including suicides [Mamun and Griffiths (2020) ] [Shigemura, Ursano, Morganstein, Kurosawa, and Benedek (2020) ].",

Several cases of anxiety, stress and panic have been reported in various countries affected with Covid-19 such s China, Japan and so on [J.-B. Li et al. (2020) ] [Shigemura et al. (2020) ]. Providing appropriate guidance to the population helps them to respond in a better way when contracted with Covid-19 [Zhao and Xu (2020) ]. Several organizations across the world such as WHO and CDC, have suggested various measures to be taken up to protect and enhance mental state of vulnerable population during pandemics, including Covid-19 [CDC (2020)][ WHO (2018) ]. Thus, analysing public emotions against Covid-19 helps in understanding the perception and preparedness towards the pandemic among the public [Hou et al. (2020) ]. It helps in broadcasting effective public health messages that are inline with public emotions, which could help the public in taking appropriate measures against Covid-19 [Van Bavel et al. (2020) ]. Several countries have issued strict home isolation and quarantine instructions towards battling Covid-19. Governments across the world have taken up health initiatives to reduce the negative psychological impact on the population during the period of home confinement and quarantine [Garriga et al.

The instructions passed by the government and severity of Covid-19 has greatly affected the day to day lives of citizens in the country. This is also observed to result in psychological stress among few people in the country. Several measures to reduce this affect are being taken up by both public and private sector organizations in the country. The government has set up helpline centers that aim towards helping people with psychological issues during the pandemic, through telephone. Also, many audio and video awareness clippings are being advertised by many organizations to prevent the psychological stress and to improve awareness among people towards the pandemic. Understanding the mood of people across various parts of the country could help various organizations in taking better measures to help citizens of the country in maintaining better psychological balance. Social Networking platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and so on serve as a source to analyse and understand emotional state of the public. Such platforms play an impor-tant role during pandemics, in assessing the mood and mental health of people across the world. Researchers across the globe have made several attempts to understand the emotions of people in various countries towards Covid-19, with an aim to help health organizations and government in taking up measures accordingly. However, most of the existing studies summarize the emotions of posts on social networking platforms during a specified time interval, but not on day to day posts. Depicting the emotion of people on a daily basis could help various organizations in understanding the changing mood of people. Hence, we present a web portal-Mood of India During Covid-19, that is aimed to provide visualizations of across various states in the country. The tweets posted on twitter related to Covid-19 are analysed and classified into one of the seven categories that include six emotions -Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Surprise, Fear and Disgust [Ekman (1992) ], and Neutral category, which are visualized on India Map based on the location from which the tweets have been posted.",

It has been observed that negative emotion tweets are observed in areas having more number of cases reported [Medford, Saleh, Sumarsono, Perl, and Lehmann (2020) ]. Sharma et al. have designed a dashboard that identifies misinformation being spread with respect to Covid-19, reactions of users to various emergency policies, country-wide sentiments and so on, and displays them on the dashboard [Sharma et al. (2020) ]. Considering the importance of posts on twitter, a multilanguage twitter dataset has been created by Lopez et al. This dataset is also expected to provide insights on public response towards the pandemic across several countries and multiple languages [Lopez, Vasu, and Gallemore (2020) ]. About 364K posts on twitter during 31 December 2019 to 6 February 2020 have been extracted and analysed to predict the outbreak of Covid-19. It has been observed that the number of tweets all over the world were directly proportional to the number of cases being reported in respective countries [Jahanbin and Rahmanian (2020) ]. Chen et al. have analysed posts on twitter during 23 March 2020 and 5 April 2020 and respective emotions associated with the posts [Chen, Lyu, Yang, Wang, and Luo (2020) ]. They observed correlations between the nature of terms used in the posts and respective sentiments of the posts. They have classified the terms into two classes -controversial and non-controversial using LDA topic modelling and the results of analysis indicated that posts with controversial terms exhibit a higher level of negative emotions [Chen et al. (2020) ]. Public emotions have been analysed based on twitter data of around 20 million posts, tweeted during 28 January 2020 and 9 April 2020 [Lwin et al. (n.d.) ]. The tweets have been classified into (2020)]. It has been observed that positive sentiments have outnumbered the negative ones in the country [Barkur and Vibha (2020) ].",

Also, we plan to mine more number of tweets related to Covid-19 in the country during the two month period of March and April to increase the accuracy of emotions being displayed. We also plan to improve the accuracy of classification model by exploring newer NLP and ML based approaches that could classify the tweets based on emotions. Furthermore, the existing portal could be improved to display mood of population with more specificity, which could include districts and cities of each state.",
