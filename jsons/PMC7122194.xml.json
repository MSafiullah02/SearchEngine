A mechanism was proposed for these reactions (Fig. 12.4). From where it can be observed that after from formation of 4-phenylthiosemicarbazide, the ionic liquid amplifies the partial positive charge on carbon in carbonyl group, producing thiosemicarbazone intermediate (1). In the next step, the ionic liquid accelerates the cyclization to form a cyclic intermediate (2) followed by aromatization to final 1,3,4-thiadiazole product, affecting its \u00adactivity and the rate enhancement role in this process. Here, the ionic liquid acted not only as a solvating medium but also as a promoter, and catalyst for the reaction, giving rise to advantage of both mild temperature conditions and the nonrequirement of a catalyst.\n\n",
