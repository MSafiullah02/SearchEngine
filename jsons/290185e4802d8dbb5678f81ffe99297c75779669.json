            "text": "1. The origin of the epidemic remains unknown. The retrospective epidemiology study of 423 cases performed by China CDC showed there may be multiple sources of infection in addition to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan from the very beginning of epidemic [7] . The significance of epidemiology of family clustering cases was also underestimated [8] . 2. The number of early cases is too small to fully understand the clinical features and severity of the disease. The earliest report of 41 confirmed cases with an alarming mortality rate, raised the question of whether this novel coronavirus could be treated as a common coronavirus [9] . Although coronavirus is an important cause of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and of pneumonia, its incidence is lower than that of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus, at least in temperate climates [10] . Of the six coronaviruses that have previously been identified as capable of causing human disease, SARS and MERS coronaviruses have been of the greatest concern, as human coronaviruses generally account for merely 5%-10% of all acute upper respiratory tract infections in adults, albeit reaching 25%-35% during outbreaks [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Human coronaviruses can cause severe pneumonia in the immunocompromised such as HIV-positive individuals, or in other vulnerable populations: in an outbreak of HCoV-OC43 infection in elderly people living in a Canadian long-term care facility the case fatality rate was 8% , the mortality is nevertheless far inferior to that of SARS and MERS, and may therefore be overlooked by the medical community [ after onset of their disease. The virus thus enjoyed an opportunity to spread for a relatively long period before patients were isolated or hospitalized. 4. Mild cases and asymptomatic infections have dramatically increased the difficulty of preventing and controlling this disease. Asymptomatic individuals and those with mild infections rarely seek medical care, allowing virus replication in the upper respiratory tract that can be transmitted to others [16] . These 'virus carriers' may be scattered across communities, families, in non-fever clinics and non-infectious disease departments in hospitals, resulting in familial clusters of pneumonia or nosocomial spread of the virus. 5. The modes of transmission are diversified. The National Health",

Other routes, such as aerosol transmission and digestive tract transmission, as suggested by the detection of viral nucleic acid in feces, remain to be confirmed. The diversity and uncertainty of transmission routes further increases the difficulty of disease preventing and control. 6. The implementation of standard precautions measures in the prevention and control of nosocomial infections was insufficient. Infection control precautions should be applied by all healthcare practitioners providing care for patients in community and primary care settings, and practitioners should be provided with guidance on correct implementation. Standard prevention should be based on the principle of treating all patients as potentially infectious and taking appropriate preventive control measures. However, constantly overloaded medical staff and hospitals in China have maintained normal operations during the initial phase of the 2019-nCoV outbreak: a Chinese general practitioner cares on average for 5,000 residents, compared to the international norm of 2,000. Under such workload, medical staff do not have enough time to fully communicate with patients or to perform hand hygiene. Standard prevention is the \"touchstone\" for the control of nosocomial infections, especially for infectious diseases of the respiratory tract. In addition, there are not enough single-patient rooms in emergency departments, fever clinics, and respiratory departments in Chinese general hospitals to ensure quarantine of patients with suspected respiratory infections. The epidemics of both SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2015 were related to lack-of-control of nosocomial infections [18, 19] .",

The key is to break the chain of infection, assisted hopefully with an understanding of the mode of transmission, but if not, at least with adoption of standard precautions. Although early detection of the source of infection can be difficult, it is still necessary to identify patients and asymptomatic infections to the fullest extent possible. All suspected patients should be quarantined in single occupancy rooms for treatment, to avoid the spread of virus within the family and the hospital. Meanwhile, suitable precautions and adherence to the principles of prevention and control of infectious diseases should be implemented to cut transmission. Appropriate measures, including isolation and the use of personal protective equipment should be considered, based on the mode of transmission of the disease: both bloodborne and non-blood-borne infections need to be considered and prevented during diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, a two-way protection (i.e. patient to the medical staff and medical staff to patient) is necessary. Hand hygiene is the most important standard precaution and one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of health carerelated pathogens.",
