Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the leading underlying cause of death in women (7.2%) and second amongst both genders and people of all ages [5]. It is forecasted that by the year 2040, one in every ten adults residing in LMICs will be living with diabetes [6]. Therefore, self-management is an important part of the treatment in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) [7] such as diabetes. Diabetes self-management is crucial to ensure that long-term complications are decreased. Diabetes self-management is based on seven self-care behaviours [8]. These include; healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medication, problem-solving, healthy coping, and reducing risks [8].",

In particular, the four key constructs of the UTAUT model, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions were used to determine the barriers for user acceptance of mobile applications discourage use and prevent behavioural intention to be converted into use. The results indicate that all four constructs of the UTAUT model can explain the barriers for user acceptance of m-health applications for diabetic patients in the Western Cape.",
