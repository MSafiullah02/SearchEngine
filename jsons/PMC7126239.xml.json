TGEV replicates in both the villous epithelial cells of the small intestine and the lung cells of newborn piglets, resulting in a mortality of nearly 100% (Saif and Wesley, 1992). The TGEV genome contains a leader sequence at the 5\u2032 end and a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end. Genes are arranged in the order 5\u2032-Rep-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 Enjuanes et al 2000b, Penzes et al 2001. The 3\u2032 end of the majority of TGEV genes overlaps with the 5\u2032 terminus of the next gene (Enjuanes et al., 2000b), complicating insertion of heterologous genes into the viral genome and deletion of different genes to determine whether they are essential.",

In contrast, group 2 coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine enteric coronavirus (BCoV), or the human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43, and group 3 coronaviruses such as avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), do not have a homologous gene 7 Enjuanes et al 2000a, Lai and Cavanagh 1997. Interestingly, the group 1 coronavirus HCoV-229E does not have gene 7 (Herold et al., 1993), which could indicate that this gene is nonessential for coronavirus replication, even in group 1 coronaviruses.",

We used a genomic TGEV cDNA clone assembled as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) Almaz\u00e1n et al 2000, Gonz\u00e1lez et al 2002 to separate the overlapping genes by duplicating sequences at the 5\u2032 flank of each gene and by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites between each gene pair. Gene separation allowed the deletion of gene 7, showing that it is nonessential for virus replication. Furthermore, we show that the accumulation of modifications in gene domains where the TRSs are located and insertion of restriction sites led to the generation of a collection of recombinant TGEVs (rTGEVs) with variable virulence, including a highly attenuated recombinant. These viruses could be the basis for coronavirus vector development.",

On the third day of transfection, a cytopathic effect was observed in cells transfected with each cDNA, but not in mock-treated cells. Virus production was amplified by passing the supernatants four times in cultured cells. After the fourth passage, viruses were cloned by three plaque-isolation steps, and their genomes were partially sequenced. All the rTGEV viruses conserved the modifications engineered in the cDNAs (data not shown), indicating that the ORF separation and the insertion of unique endonuclease restriction sites between genes were stably maintained in the rTGEV genomes.",

In contrast, in vivo assays showed lower TGEV mutant virus replication in the lungs and gut, and attenuation of virulence in viruses in which a TRS duplication was introduced between genes. In arteriviruses, mutants that had the overlap between ORFs 4 and 5, or between ORFs 5 and 6 removed, were also viable (de Vries et al., 2000).

The first approach was the introduction of punctual mutations in the TGEV genome to generate the restriction sites PacI (between genes Rep 1b and S) and MluI (between genes S and 3a) (Fig. 1B). Due to overlapping in the TGEV genome, the second approach involved the duplication of 13, 22, and 19 nucleotides from the 5\u2032 transcription-regulating sequences of genes M, N, and 7 (TRS-M, TRS-N, and TRS-7) after the restriction sites FseI, PmeI, and AscI, respectively (Fig. 1A and B). Point mutations, duplications, and insertion of restriction endonuclease sites were generated by overlapping PCR amplification from the TGEV genome as described (Ortego et al., 2002).
