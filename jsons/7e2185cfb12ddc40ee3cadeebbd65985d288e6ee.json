It is known that those working in healthcare settings face increased exposure to agents causing infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, but may also have better infectious disease protection plans and policies than other occupational settings, potentially limiting the transmission of disease to community members [3] . While important, these measures may be inadequate for the effective prevention of infection for such high risk occupations, especially when they are working with inadequate PPE stockpiles, and the hospitals are overwhelmed due to heavy patient loads [4] . Nearly 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China (as of February 11, 2020) were in healthcare workers, indicating the workplace is a potential location of transmission even among workers who are trained to protect themselves from biological hazards [5] .",

These workplace and regulatory policies will be valuable in helping reduce the transmission of infectious disease from and within the workplace, and their importance may be realized with burden estimates Previously, state-level employment data were utilized to estimate the number of workers exposed to a host of occupational exposures in United States Federal Region X (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska), spanning chemical, physical, ergonomic, and psychosocial hazards [7] . Here, utilizing the same data analysis methods as previously detailed in Doubleday et al., the number of workers across the United States exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month is estimated. Despite some of the inherent limitations in using these existing data sources, we believe this analysis is valuable for informing risk assessments and prompting protective actions that occupational sectors and regulatory agencies can take during infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19.",

As nearly 600 six-digit SOC occupations are updated each year, the entire O \ufffd NET database is completely refreshed every few years [11] . Between 2001 and 2011, nearly 160,000 employees from 125,000 workplaces had responded to O \ufffd NET questionnaires. O \ufffd NET uses a deliberate survey sampling scheme, to ensure representation of workers from across the United States, across organizations of different size, and from both government and private workers. For small SOCs where it may be hard to find respondents, and to complement data from job incumbents, O-NET also relies on occupational analysts and occupational experts to answer questionnaires. O \ufffd NET does not collect data from military occupations; thus, SOC codes beginning with 55 \"Military Specific Occupations\" are not included in O \ufffd NET data. Similarly, employment numbers for \"Military Specific Occupations\" is not reported in the BLS Occupational Employment Statistics Database. No other SOC codes are excluded from the O \ufffd NET database, but two SOC codes were not included in the measure utilized for this analysis, which were for the occupations of \"Rock Splitters, Quarry\" and \"Timing Device Assemblers and Adjusters\" employing 4,870 and 780 persons in the United States, respectively [12] .",

            "text": "During an infectious disease outbreak, the workplace can play an important role in both spreading the disease [15, 16] and helping to stop the spread of disease through workplace practices and policies [1, 17] . Understanding the wide range of occupations that could be exposed to infection or disease due to work activities is important for planning risk management and communication to workers, in addition to prioritizing workplace response plans. This analysis estimates that the number of workers who face frequent exposure to an infection or disease at work; estimates of the number of workers who fall ill due to such exposures are not possible in this analysis. However, a primary goal of public health, especially in the face of a global pandemic, is to prevent the spread of disease. Therefore, understanding how many workers are frequently exposed, and what occupations they represent, is an important first step in being able to prompt and enact risk reduction strategies prior to disease transmission occurring, and illness manifesting. Thus, the results reported here have important public health implications. Several limitations must be emphasized. Exposure to disease or infection in the workplace, and resultant transmission into the community, is dependent on many factors which were not able to be investigated in this analysis. This includes number of contacts that worker has with the public, workplace emphasis on and access to handwashing, number of interactions with bodily fluids, existing hygiene and cleaning practices in the workplace, availability of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) etc. While certainly this could vary between occupations, many of these factors would also vary within occupations, and none of these data were captured with the O \ufffd NET data. Presenteeism, reporting to work despite being symptomatic for disease, is common in the workplace, and is another contributor to the transmission of infectious disease, and potentially to the spread of epidemics or pandemics [2, 18] . One analysis examined the role of workplace transmission in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, estimating that about 8 million employees in the United States worked while infected, and that these workers may have caused the infection of as many as 7 million of their co-workers [19] .",

Workers without access to paid leave have higher rates of presenteeism, and are less likely to receive preventative health services such as getting flu shots [22] . Occupational sector also influences rates of presenteeism, with studies from various countries showing higher rates of presenteeism among workers in healthcare, public service, and educational sectors, as these essential services often do not have substitute workers available [23] [24] [25] . Indeed, a recent systematic review identified occupation type as one of the strongest predictors of presenteeism [2] . As many of these sectors are already exposed to disease due to work activities, it is important that disease response plans for these sectors include not only control methods to reduce exposures at work, but also contingency plans to ensure sick workers do not come back to work with disease. This could be accomplished through cross-training, providing extra paid sick leave during this time, ensuring flexible working conditions, and ensuring substitute workers are identified to fill in if essential workers fall ill.",

O \ufffd NET data were generated from self-reported subjective questionnaires and therefore are subject to bias and misclassification. Respondents may not realize they are exposed to infection or disease at work unless they are in a workplace where these hazards are communicated to them and protective equipment is provided (e.g., healthcare sectors) leading to potential differential misclassification across occupational groups. Workers could also be reporting expose to disease or infection that occurs while commuting to work (particularly by public transportation), leading to additional misclassification. Additionally, information from the O \ufffd NET database is applied at the occupation-level, and therefore does not account for within-job exposure variation [26] . Many workers are not included in the O \ufffd NET and BLS data sources, including independent contractors (which includes \"gig economy\" workers), domestic workers, self-employed, undocumented, and continent workers. These workers may be uniquely susceptible to exposure at work due to limited ability to take time off if they or a family member is ill [27] . In Sweden and Norway, higher rates of presenteeism (coming to work when sick) were found among low-income and immigrant workers [28] . This further emphasizes the importance of continuing to develop occupational surveillance systems that capture exposures and outcomes experienced by these undercounted groups, as well as ensure worker protections extend to protect these undercounted workers.",

These are workers that public health should consider especially at risk for COVID-19, due to frequent exposure to disease and infectious agents. However, it should be noted that there are many other workers that could also be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, or encourage the spread of COVID-19, such as workers who are not given access to flexible working, workers who do not feel they can take sick time if they or a family member is sick, workers who do not have access to paid sick leave, or workers that perform essential services and do not have access to substitute workers. Work presented here underscores the importance of all workplaces developing sector-specific response plans to keep employees safe, halt the transmission of disease in the workplace, and ensure sick workers do not have to come to work. It also serves as a reminder that the workplace is an important locus for public health interventions, as many workers are frequently exposed to disease and infection at work, and their exposures can Increase disease incidence both in worker and community groups.",
