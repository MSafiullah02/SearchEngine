The announcement was met with both relief and consternation in the academic medicine community, as medical students, educators, and residency program directors weighed the implications of significantly altering the scoring on a key assessment of students' basic science knowledge. [2] [3] [4] At the time of the announcement, many in academic medicine felt that this change was one of the most abrupt and significant disruptions in medical education they had ever experienced. As the chief medical education officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), I had been deeply involved with the Invitational Conference on USMLE Scoring (InCUS), which preceded the decision to change Step 1 scoring, and I anticipated that my leadership role in the InCUS follow-up work would be among the most complex and challenging of my career.",

Changes, both systemic and specific to the USMLE, must be identified, explored, and implemented. When FSMB and NBME made the announcement to change Step 1 scoring to pass/fail, they created a unilateral change to the USMLE, at least for the short term. That change resulted in student anxiety about Step 1 shifting to bigger questions: What will program directors use instead of Step 1 scores? How will students distinguish themselves if they are interested in a competitive specialty, if they are from a newer or less well-known medical school, or if they are a graduate of a non-U.S. medical school?",
