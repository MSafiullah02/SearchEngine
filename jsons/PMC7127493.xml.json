            "text": "Infection of eukaryotic cells by enveloped viruses requires fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular plasma or endosomal membrane Hoekstra and Kok 1989, Stegmann et al 1989. Specific viral envelope glycoproteins help to overcome the energy barriers associated with this process. Most of the known viral fusion proteins are integral membrane proteins that contain a region consisting of about 15\u201330 mostly apolar amino acids, named the fusion peptide (White, 1990). This region can be located either at the N terminus, as in most orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and several retroviruses White et al 1983, Blumberg et al 1985, Gallaher 1987, or in the interior of the fusion protein, as in Rous sarcoma virus (Hunter et al., 1983), vesicular stomatitis virus (Whitt et al., 1990), or Ebola virus (Gallaher, 1996). Various studies have shown the importance of the fusion peptide in membrane fusion. Mutational analysis revealed that substituting critical residues in influenza hemagglutinin (Gething et al., 1986), SIV (Bosch et al., 1989), HIV (Freed et al., 1992), vesicular stomatitis virus (Fredericksen & Whitt, 1995), avian leukosis virus (Hernandez & White, 1998), or murine coronavirus (Luo & Weiss, 1998) fusion peptides is sufficient to abolish membrane fusion. However, mutational studies are sometimes difficult to analyze, since in addition to the local effects, single mutations can also affect the overall folding of the fusion protein. Hydrophobic photoaffinity labeling has been used to show that the fusion peptide of influenza hemagglutinin penetrates deeply into the target membrane during fusion (Harter et al., 1989), and has also helped to identify the fusion domain of the envelope glycoprotein of rabies and vesicular stomatitis viruses (Durrer et al., 1995).",

            "text": "The family of paramyxoviridae includes well-known respiratory tract pathogens affecting children, which were shown to be a major cause of croup, pneumonia and bronchiolitis (Collins et al., 1996). A prominent feature of paramyxoviridae infection is the fusion of infected cells with their neighbors, leading to the formation of multinucleated cells named syncytia (Lamb & Kolakofsky, 1996), thus highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanism of membrane fusion. The fusion protein of Sendai virus, a member of the paramyxoviridae family, is synthesized as an inactive precursor, F0, which is activated by a host protease, producing two disulfide-linked subunits, F1 and F2 Homma and Ohuchi 1973, Scheid and Choppin 1977. The newly formed N terminus of F1 is known as the fusion peptide (Gething et al., 1978). However, it is unlikely that the whole membrane fusion process is accounted for by a small N-terminal segment of a protein that consists of more than 560 amino acid residues. Moreover, it has been shown that regions other than the fusion peptide in influenza hemagglutinin Yu et al 1994, Epand et al 1999, HIV-1 (Rabenstein & Shin, 1995), and Sendai virus Ghosh et al 1998, Ben-Efraim et al 1999 are able to bind to membranes, thus suggesting that several membrane-interacting segments may have a role in the fusion process. In an attempt to identify regions other than the N-terminal fusion peptide in the Sendai virus F1 protein that could participate in the actual merging of the viral and cellular membranes, we screened its ectodomain for segments with homology to known fusion peptides and found a region, corresponding to amino acids 214\u2013226, highly homologous to the fusion peptide of the HIV-1 and RSV envelope glycoproteins. In order to analyze the fusogenic ability of this specific region, located in the interior of the F1 protein, we synthesized two peptides corresponding to amino acids 208\u2013229 and 201\u2013229, namely SV-208 and SV-201, and compared their ability to induce membrane fusion of large unilamellar vesicles to that of the N-terminal 33-amino acid fusion peptide. We used as controls, a peptide that partially overlaps the N terminus of SV-208 (amino acids 178\u2013210) and one with the same amino acid composition as SV-208, but with a scrambled sequence. We found that SV-208 and SV-201 induce membrane fusion at concentrations at which the N-terminal fusion peptide, the shifted, and the scrambled peptides are inactive. Based on the results presented here, we postulate a revised model for paramyxovirus-induced membrane fusion.",

In order to determine the role of the fusion peptide-like segment in the process of membrane fusion, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to amino acids 208\u2013229 of the Sendai virus F1 protein, namely SV-208, (Figure 1(b) and (c)) and compared its fusogenic ability to that of the N-terminal fusion peptide from the same protein (amino acids 117\u2013149). Since the fusion peptide-like sequence is located in the interior of the F1 protein, a peptide elongated seven amino acids to the N terminus, SV-201, was also synthesized. A peptide with the same amino acid composition as SV-208, but with the fusion peptide-like sequence scrambled, namely Mu-SV-208, and one that partially overlaps its N terminus (amino acids 178\u2013210), namely SV-178, were used as controls.",

Briefly, a population of LUV labeled both with NBD-PE and Rho-PE (22 \u03bcM) is mixed with a population of unlabeled LUV (88 \u03bcM) and different concentrations of peptides are added. Fusion between the labeled and unlabeled vesicles caused by the peptide results in dilution of the labeled lipids and therefore reduced energy transfer between NBD-PE and Rho-PE. This change is visualized as an increase of NBD fluorescence. The dependence of both the extent and the kinetics of lipid mixing on the lipid to peptide molar ratio were analyzed. In separate experiments, increasing amounts of SV-208, SV-201, Mu-SV-208, SV-178, and the N-terminal fusion peptide, were added to a fixed amount of vesicles. In order to compare the activity of the different peptides, the percentage of lipid mixing as a function of the lipid to peptide molar ratio is shown in Figure 2(a). Clearly, SV-208 is more active than the N-terminal fusion peptide in inducing lipid mixing of model membranes. Elongation of SV-208 does not affect its activity, suggesting that the ability of SV-208 to induce membrane fusion is not related to the N-terminal proximity of the fusion peptide-like sequence in the synthetic peptide. On the contrary, the scrambled peptide and SV-178 are substantially less active, indicating that the fusogenic activity depends on the peptide sequence. Furthermore, a peptide corresponding to the homologous region from measles virus was also active (unpublished results), suggesting a similar role for the homologous region in different paramyxoviruses. Similar results were observed with PC/PS (1:1) LUV and therefore are not shown. Time profiles depicted in Figure 2(b) show that maximal activities were reached at about five minutes.",

The binding curves obtained for both peptides are very similar (Figure 4(a)). Since both SV-208 and Mu-SV-208 are monomeric in aqueous solution, as revealed by rhodamine dequenching experiments (data not shown), we were able to analyze the binding isotherms as partition equilibria (Rapaport & Shai, 1991). The surface partition coefficients were estimated from the initial slopes of the curves shown in Figure 4(b)\n(Beschiaschvili & Seelig, 1990), and were found to be 6.7(\u00b10.4) \u00d7 104 M\u22121, and 7.3(\u00b10.2) \u00d7 104 M\u22121, for SV-208 and Mu-SV-208, respectively. Since these values are similar, we have concluded that the peptides have similar membrane-binding affinities. However, as the concentration of peptide increases, the bound fraction, corresponding to SV-208, increases faster than that of Mu-SV-208, suggesting positive cooperativity for the binding of the wild-type peptide. Since this indicates that SV-208 may self-associate in the membrane, the oligomerization state of the membrane-bound peptides was further analyzed (see below).",

In order to determine whether this was also true for SV-208, the fluorescence of NBD-labeled peptides was analyzed upon binding to the membrane. The sensitivity of the NBD moiety to the dielectric constant of its surroundings allows us to determine the environment of the NBD-labeled peptides in their membrane-bound state. It has already been shown that the fluorescence emission of NBD shifts to lower wavelengths upon relocation of the NBD moiety to a more hydrophobic environment (Rajarathnam et al., 1989). The fluorescence emission spectra of NBD-labeled SV-208 and Mu-SV-208 were measured in aqueous solution and in the presence of PC/PG (1:1) SUV. In both cases a shift toward lower wavelengths, with a concomitant increase in the fluorescence intensity, was observed after addition of the vesicles (data not shown), indicating that the NBD-labeled peptides interact with the lipidic membranes. The maximal fluorescence emission was 524 nm and 525 nm, for SV-208 and Mu-SV-208, respectively. A similar value was obtained for the HIV-1 fusion peptide (524 nm) (Kliger et al., 1997), which is known to be inserted into the membrane (Chang & Cheng, 1998). Furthermore, Rajarathnam and colleagues have shown that the emission maximum of NBD when inserted into membranes is close to 526 nm, whereas a maximum around 535 nm was observed when the NBD was linked to the polar head of phosphatidylethanolamine, located on the membrane\u2019s surface (Rajarathnam et al., 1989). Therefore we can deduce that the N terminus of both SV-208 and the mutant peptide is located close to the hydrophobic core of the membrane.",

Moreover, several known fusion peptides have been shown to oligomerize in the membrane Rapaport and Shai 1994, Kliger et al 1997. To determine whether the fusogenic activity of SV-208 is correlated with its ability to oligomerize in the membrane, the aggregation state of SV-208 and Mu-SV-208 was determined by resonance energy transfer measurements. Briefly, peptides labeled at their N terminus either with NBD, serving as energy donors, or with rhodamine, serving as energy acceptors, were used. In a typical experiment, a donor peptide (final concentration of 0.06 \u03bcM) was added to a dispersion of PC/PG (1:1) SUV (200 \u03bcM) in PBS, followed by the addition of an acceptor peptide in several sequential doses. As depicted in Figure 6, when NBD- and Rho-labeled SV-208 were used as a donor and an acceptor, respectively, dose-dependent quenching of the donor\u2019s emission was observed. However, when NBD and Rho-labeled Mu-SV-208 were used, the observed energy transfer was similar to that expected from randomly distributed donors and acceptors (Fung & Stryer, 1987). The lipid to peptide ratio was kept high (>3000:1) to create a low surface density of donors and acceptors to reduce the energy transfer between unassociated peptides, and to ensure that essentially all the peptide is bound to membranes (as deduced from Figure 4(a)). Note that the acceptor-peptide was added only after the donor-peptide was already bound to the membrane, thus preventing any association in solution. These results indicate that SV-208 but not Mu-SV-208 is able to oligomerize in its membrane-bound state.",

The fractional helicities, calculated according to the elipticity at 222 nm (Wu et al., 1981), are 17% in PBS, 25% in PC/PG (1:1) SUV, and 35% in 1% SDS for SV-208, and 8 % in PBS, 18% in PC/PG (1:1) SUV, and 24% in 1% SDS, for Mu-SV-208. Note that the lipid/peptide molar ratio used was about 500:1, and according to the binding curve (see Figure 4(a)) at this ratio only about 75% of the peptides are bound to the vesicles. It was not possible to increase the lipid/peptide ratio due to light-scattering caused by the vesicles.",

Moreover, SV-208 induces fusion more efficiently than the 33-amino acid N-terminal fusion peptide (Figure 2). Furthermore, a peptide elongated to the N terminus, SV-201, is also active, indicating that SV-208 can act as an internal fusion peptide, suggesting that our findings could also be relevant in the context of the full-length protein. On the other hand, the scrambled and the shifted peptides are not active, although both peptides bind to membranes. Similarly, two peptides corresponding to the N-terminal and the C-terminal heptad repeats of the Sendai virus F1 protein, which were shown to bind to membranes (Ben-Efraim et al., 1999), were also tested and found not to induce lipid mixing (data not shown). This confirms that membrane-binding ability itself is not enough to achieve fusion. Furthermore, in spite of the low sequence homology, a peptide modeled after the homologous region of the measles virus F1 protein is also active (unpublished results), suggesting that the presence of an internal fusion peptide is a general feature of paramyxoviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the specific location of a second fusion active segment has been determined in a viral fusion protein. It has been shown very recently that a 127 amino acid segment corresponding to the full-length ectodomain of influenza hemagglutinin promotes rapid pH-dependent membrane fusion (Epand et al., 1999). The 20 amino acid fusion peptide and a 95 amino acid construct, lacking the fusion peptide, were also able to induce some lipid mixing, although substantially less efficiently than the full-length ectodomain. This suggests that regions from the ectodomain of influenza hemagglutinin, other than the fusion peptide, might be able to induce lipid mixing. However, the specific location of such regions remains unknown. Moreover, it should be noted that the ectodomain of influenza hemagglutinin is much shorter than those of paramyxoviruses, and its coiled coil is formed by a C-terminal heptad repeat (Bullough et al., 1994), whereas paramixoviruses contain two heptad repeats, one following the N-terminal fusion peptide and the other preceding the transmembrane domain, which are separated by more than 280 amino acids (Lamb & Kolakofsky, 1996).",

Here we analyzed the extent of membrane penetration by fluorescence spectroscopy and enzymatic digestion experiments. While the NBD fluorescence emission indicates that the N terminus of the peptides is located close to the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, the susceptibility of the membrane-bound peptides to enzymatic digestion shows that at least part of the peptide backbones lie on the membrane surface (Figure 5), thus suggesting an oblique orientation.",

Disruption of the \u03b1-helical structure of fusogenic peptides either by the addition of proline residues (Lee et al., 1992) or by the substitution of two l-amino acids with their d-enantiomers (Rapaport et al., 1993) abolished the fusogenic activity of the peptides. Here, we found a correlation between the higher \u03b1-helical content of SV-208 and its fusogenic ability, when compared with those of Mu-SV-208.

            "text": "Synthetic peptides can only partly mimic the complex fusogenic properties of a viral protein. Nevertheless, properties that were found to be crucial in the present study, such as fusogenic activity, oligomerization in the membrane and \u03b1-helical secondary structure, were proposed to be also requirements of viral-induced membrane fusion (White, 1990). Recently, it has been shown that both the N-terminal and the C-terminal heptad repeats of the Sendai virus fusion protein, which form a strong complex in solution (Ghosh et al., 1998), dissociate into \u03b1-helical monomers upon binding to membranes (Ben-Efraim et al., 1999). In agreement with these observations, NMR studies showed that the N-terminal heptad repeat of the homologous Newcastle disease virus fusion protein has an \u03b1-helical structure in SDS, consistent with the notion that it binds parallel with the bilayer, as a monomer, with its hydrophobic face buried in the membrane (Young et al., 1999). Furthermore, the N-terminal heptad repeat of the Sendai virus F1 protein, located between the N-terminal fusion peptide and SV-208, has been shown to assist the N-terminal fusion peptide in inducing membrane fusion (Ghosh & Shai, 1999). These results suggest that the region of the F1 protein that corresponds to the internal fusion peptide SV-208 could be in proximity to the membrane during the fusion process, thus supporting our observations. The previous model for Sendai virus-induced membrane fusion is shown in Figure 8(a), (b) and (c)\n(Ben-Efraim et al., 1999). Our results led us to extend this model, suggesting a specific role for the internal fusion peptide in relation to the full-length F1 protein (Figure 8(a), (d), (e) and (f)). According to the extended model, binding of the viral surface glycoprotein to cell receptors (Figure 8(a)) results in a conformational change of the fusion protein, which leads to the formation of a trimeric coiled-coil, analogous to the conformation observed in the 3-D structures of other fusion proteins Bullough et al 1994, Fass et al 1996, Chan et al 1997, Weissenhorn et al 1997, Weissenhorn et al 1998, Malashkevich et al 1998, Malashkevich et al 1999, Baker et al 1999, Kobe et al 1999, Yang et al 1999. It should be noted that a leucine zipper-like sequence, SV-269, is located at a position following the internal fusion peptide. This region has been shown to interact with the C-terminal heptad repeat (Ghosh et al., 1997). However, this interaction was found to be thermally unstable, suggesting that this region is not a component of the final, most stable core of the F protein (Dutch et al., 1999). There is no experimental evidence yet to determine whether the N-terminal fusion peptide or the internal fusion peptide inserts into the target membrane first. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the N-terminal fusion peptide inserts into the target membrane first (Figure 8(d)), the existence of a second fusion peptide consecutive to the N-terminal heptad repeat opens the possibility that the initial interaction with the target membrane is achieved by means of the internal fusion peptide, which in this conformation is located on top of the coiled-coil, as suggested in Figure 8(e). According to CD spectroscopy (Figure 7) and resonance energy transfer (Figure 6), the internal fusion peptide oligomerizes and adopts an \u03b1-helical structure upon membrane binding. In this conformation, the N-terminal fusion peptide might be embedded in the viral membrane, in agreement with the models suggested by Kozlov and Chernomordik 1998, Bentz 2000. It has been shown by Ben-Efraim et al. (1999) that the affinity of both the N-terminal and the C-terminal heptad repeats to the membrane causes the \u201cumbrella\u201d-like opening of the coiled-coil (Figure 8(f)). This membrane-induced conformational change consequently causes the cellular and viral membranes to approach each other. Subsequently, both the N-terminal and the internal fusion peptides induce the actual merging of the membranes. Further experiments are needed to determine whether both fusion-active segments destabilize the same membrane. The location of the internal and the N-terminal fusion peptides, both in the same membrane (Figure 8(f)) is therefore speculative.",

Two alternative pathways are possible: the N-terminal fusion peptide inserts into the target membrane first (d); or the initial interaction with the target membrane is achieved by means of the internal fusion peptide, which in this conformation is located on top of the coiled-coil (e). After the initial binding, the affinity of both the N-terminal and the C-terminal heptad repeats to the membrane causes the opening of the coiled-coil (f). This membrane-induced conformational change causes the cellular and viral membranes to approach each other.
