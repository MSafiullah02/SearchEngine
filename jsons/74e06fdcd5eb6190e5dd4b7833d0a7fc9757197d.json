This study sought to develop and evaluate a unified population pharmacokinetic model in both pediatric and adult patients receiving cefepime treatment. Methods Multiple physiologically relevant models were fit to pediatric and adult subject data. To evaluate the final model performance, a withheld group of 12 pediatric patients and two separate adult populations were assessed. Results Seventy subjects with a total of 604 cefepime concentrations were included in this study. All adults (n = 34) on average weighed 82.7 kg and displayed a mean creatinine clearance of 106.7 mL/min. All pediatric subjects (n = 36) had mean weight and creatinine clearance of 16.0 kg and 195.6 mL/min, respectively. A covariate-adjusted two-compartment model described the observed concentrations well (population model R 2 , 87.0%; Bayesian model R 2 , 96.5%). In the evaluation subsets, the model performed similarly well (population R 2 , 84.0%; Bayesian R 2 , 90.2%). Conclusion The identified model serves well for population dosing and as a Bayesian prior for precision dosing.",

            "text": "Cefepime, like other \u03b2-lactams, has pharmacodynamic activity governed by 'time-dependent' activity. The fraction of time that the unbound drug concentration exceeds the MIC (fT >MIC ) for the dosing interval is the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) efficacy target for cefepime [4] , and a target of 60-74% has been previously proposed [5] [6] [7] [8] . For the currently approved cefepime product and combination agents in the pipeline [9, 10] , understanding cefepime disposition and variability is crucial to for optimal treatment of patients. As inter-and intra-patient PK variability can impact the achievement of PD goals, understanding the precision of population dosing is important. Further, to fully realize precision dosing, individualized models (e.g., Bayesian models) are needed. Once developed, these models will form the basis for adaptive feedback and control strategies when paired with real-time drug assays. The purpose of this study was to: (1) develop and evaluate a unified cefepime population PK model for adult and pediatric patients, and (2) construct an individualized model that can be utilized to deliver precision cefepime dosing.",

In brief, populations represented were febrile neutropenic adults with hematologic malignancies [13, 14] , those with critical illness [12] , and children with presumed or documented bacterial infections [11] . For the two studies that evaluated adults with neutropenic fever, Sime et al. prospectively enrolled 12 patients receiving chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant who subsequently developed febrile neutropenia and were administered maximum doses of cefepime [13] . A total of 53 cefepime plasma concentrations in presumably steady-state dosing intervals (third, sixth, and ninth) were analyzed for PK target attainment. Whited et al. prospectively studied similar patients (n = 9) who were admitted to hematology-oncology services and were receiving cefepime at a maximum dosage for febrile neutropenia [14] . Cefepime PK samples were obtained during steady state and analyzed for population parameters. Critically ill adults were studied by Roberts et al. as a prospective multinational PK study and included 14 patients who received cefepime (only n = 13 were included for model evaluation) [12] . Last, Reed et al. characterized cefepime pharmacokinetics in hospitalized pediatric patients (above 2 months of age) who received cefepime as monotherapy for bacterial infections [11] . For our study, only those who received intravenous cefepime were included for model development.",

Weight and CrCL displayed relationships with the standard two-compartment model (i.e., base two-compartment model). Volume of distribution was associated with weight (p < 0.2) and Ke (total) was associated with CrCL (p < 0.2). After standardizing weight (to 70 kg) without an allometric scaler in the base two-compartment model, fits for both population and Bayesian posterior estimates against the observed data improved (R 2 = 60.7% and 96.5%, respectively; OFV change, 4). Bias and imprecision for Bayesian posterior fits were \u2212 0.18 and 1.12, respectively. When covariates (i.e., weight to volume of distribution and K e ; CrCL to K e ) and the allometric scaler were applied in the two-compartment model, Bayesian posteriors fit well (R 2 = 96.5%; Fig. 2 right) with low bias and imprecision (\u2212 0.15 and 1.07, respectively), and the population PK model produced good fits of the observed cefepime concentrations (R 2 = 87.0%, bias = 0.53, imprecision = 7.75; Fig. 2 left) . The OFV change from the weightadjusted two-compartment model to the final model was significant at \u2212 34 (p < 0.05) [ Table 1 ]. The final model also produced acceptable predicted checks (Fig. 3) . Thus, a two-compartment model with weight and CrCL as covariate adjustments and allometric scaling was selected as the final PK model. The population parameter values from the final PK model are summarized in Table 2 . Structural model and differential equations that define the population PK are listed in the ESM. The population parameter value covariance matrix can be found in Table 3 . Additionally, weighted residual error plots for the best-fit model (Fig. S1 ) and scatter plots for covariates for the base structural model (Fig. S2) can be found included in the ESM.

When paired with a real-time assay for cefepime, this model allows for precise and accurate predictions of cefepime disposition via adaptive feedback control. In the absence of real-time assays, these cefepime PK parameters facilitate more accurate population-based dosing Table 3 Population parameter value covariance matrix for the best-fit model strategies. Previous work by Rhodes et al. has shown an absolute difference of approximately 20% in survival probability across the continuum of achieving 0-100% fT >MIC in adult patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections, thus understanding the dose and re-dosing interval necessary to achieve optimal PK exposures should greatly improve clinical outcomes for patients treated with cefepime [5] . Individualized dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (e.g., cefepime) are critically important to achieving optimal drug exposure (i.e., optimal fT >MIC as the PK/PD target) and improving clinical outcomes [4, 25, 26] . Precision medicine has been named as a major focus for the National Health Institute with $215 million invested [27] , yet precision medicine has mostly focused on genomic differences [28, 29] . Precision dosing is an important facet of precision medicine, and renewed efforts in precision dosing in the real-world setting are being pursued [30] . Cefepime is a highly relevant example. While rigorous reviews and analyses are conducted during the development phase of an antibiotic, dose optimization is far less ideal for the types of patients who ultimately receive the drug. This is highlighted by the fact that although cefepime-associated neurotoxicity is rare, this serious and potentially life-threatening adverse event has been increasingly reported and few strategies exist for optimizing and delivering precision exposures [31, 32] . Lamoth et al. found that a cefepime trough concentration of \u2265 22 mg/L has a 50% probability of predicting neurotoxicity [33] . Huwyler et al. identified a similar predictive threshold of > 20 mg/dL (five-fold increased risk for neurologic events) [34] . In contrast, Rhodes et al. found the cut-off of 22 mg/L to be suboptimal [35] . Furthermore, Rhodes et al. performed simulations from literature cefepime data and observed a high intercorrelation amongst all PK parameters (i.e., area under the curve at steady state, maximum plasma concentration, and minimum plasma concentration), suggesting that more work is needed to establish the pharmacokinetic/toxicodynamic (PK/TD) profile for cefepime. In addition to complications by these less-than-ideal PK/ TD data, clinicians are left to treat patients with extreme age differences, organ dysfunction, and comorbid conditions affecting antibiotic pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics [26] . Further, a contemporary dose reduction strategy based on estimated renal function (e.g., estimated CrCL using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) is also likely to be confounded in these patients by intrinsic PK variability, such as changes in volume of distribution, and the challenges of accurately estimating the glomerular filtration rate at any point in time, leading to more 'uncertainties' in balancing dose optimization and adverse events [9, 36] . These 'real-world' patients are often under-represented, and thus not well understood, from a PK/PD and PK/TD standpoint during the drug approval process. Bridging to the more typical patients that are clinically treated is important and central to the mission of precision medicine. The findings of this study can be used to guide cefepime dosing in these 'real-world' patients.",

Our simulation findings are similar to those of Shoji et al. that the maximum pediatric cefepime dosing did not adequately achieve optimal exposure to target higher MICs. While the cefepime package labeling recommends maximum dosages of 2 g every 8 h for adult patients with neutropenic fever and 50 mg/kg every 8 h for pediatric patients with pneumonia and/or neutropenic fever, there may be a need to extend these dosing regimens to other populations (in the absence of aforementioned indications) to achieve the best clinical outcomes by optimizing the PK/PD attainment goals [9] .",

Nicasio et al. also conducted a simulation using a PD target of 50% f T>MIC in the critically ill with varying renal function. The maximum recommended dosage (2 g every 8 h) in patients with CrCL between 50 and 120 mL/min achieved a PTA of 78.1% at an MIC of 16 mg/L; however, when the same regimen was infused over 0.5 h, the PTA achieved was significantly lower [37] . Collectively, these findings suggest that cefepime exposure is highly variable and may be clinically suboptimal in a large number of patients commonly treated with cefepime.
