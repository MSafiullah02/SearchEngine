At the same time, during the early days of the pandemic, health systems have also seen a decrease in the number of patients presenting for acute care unrelated to COVID-19 1 . Given public health recommendations to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many patients are not seeking and receiving care for acute conditions which may put them at significant risk for preventable morbidity and mortality in the future. The characteristics of those patients who are and are not presenting to emergency departments as a result of stay at home orders during the early days of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have not yet been substantially examined in the medical literature. We report changes in the characteristics of patients and presentations to the emergency department (ED) of an urban Level-1 Trauma Center before and after the statewide announcement of \"peacetime emergency\" public health measures to respond to the pandemic on March 13, 2020 2 .",

We found significant changes in ED patient demographics. The significant proportional decreases in visits by the overlapping populations of patients over 65 and Medicare recipients are likely a product of the extra prudence of higher risk individuals who are social distancing and staying at home. The significant proportional declines in visits by pediatric, ambulatory, and other patients likely reflect concerns about contracting COVID-19 in health care settings, overburdening the health care system with unrelated complaints, and adhering to public health recommendations. The decrease in number of patients who left prior to evaluation or discharge is likely due at least in part to the substantial operational changes made in response to the pandemic which have further streamlined patient triage, rooming, and evaluation.",

The most alarming finding of this report, however, is simply the overall decline in care-seeking for acute and potentially life-threatening conditions unrelated to COVID-19 1 . Societal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to multiple phenomena, including diminished air pollution, traffic, and infectious disease transmission, which could all potentially contribute to improved population health over the long term 1 . These phenomena may well influence exacerbations of respiratory conditions as well as COVID-19 infections and outcomes over the short term 3 , but most of the conditions seen and managed in the emergency department would not be expected to suddenly decrease in incidence. Variable disease severity could play a role, as patients with less acute conditions might be able to delay or defer seeking care. Though we did not examine low acuity presentations that might also be managed in other outpatient settings, we did find a disproportionate decrease in presentations of back pain and other non-specific pains.",
