The above raises interesting questions about the effect of MRSV\u2010Env on blood\u2010brain barrier integrity.99 In parallel, HERV\u2010W Env impairs remyelination by inhibiting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors to myelin\u2010producing oligodendrocytes, potentially due to nitrosative stress.100 The HERV\u2010W glycoprotein syncytin\u20101 also seems to be implicated in MS via a similar mechanism; it causes an endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor to induce inducible nitric oxygen synthase and, concomitantly, the release of oligodendrocyte cytotoxins by astrocytes (for further details, see101). Also, HERVs can induce EAE in mice, implying a role upstream of other mediators.102 Therefore, HERVs seem to be implicated in both the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease, rendering them promising therapeutic targets.",
