            "text": "There is not enough experimental data available for COVID-19, but it is considered a mutation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome. 14 Therefore, it is expected that it will behave in a similar manner. 15 Corona viruses are not primarily neurotropic virus and their primary target is respiratory epithelium. The target receptor for attachment to cell and subsequent internalization is through the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE 2). After entry into the cell the virus RNA is released in the cytoplasm subsequently translated and replicated, after formation of envelope protein and incorporation of RNA into it the virus is released in the circulation. 16 ACE 2 receptors are also found in glial cells in brain and spinal neurons. Hence it can attach, multiply and damage the neuronal tissue. There is evidence from the animal experiments in mice that coronavirus enters the brain through a retrograde transfer via the olfactory epithelium or through the cribriform bone and reaches the brain in seven days' time. Secondly, during the viremia phase of illness, disruption of blood brain barrier causes the virus to enter the brain directly. Another postulated mechanism is the invasion of peripheral nerve terminals by CoV which then gains entry to the CNS through the synapse connected route. SinceCOVID-19 has similarities with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, therefore it can be presumed that it also follows the same pathways for CNS invasion as discussed above. The detailed discussion of host and virus interaction is beyond the scope of this article, and has been published elsewhere. 15, 16 Neuropathological Mechanism of CNS damage COVID-19 results in neurological damage likely by two mechanisms; hypoxic brain injury and an immune mediated damage to the CNS.",

CT scan chest showed ground glass opacity suggestive of viral pneumonia. CT scan brain revealeda massive bleed within the right hemisphere with intraventricular and subarachnoid extension. This gentleman was neither a known hypertensive nor on any anticoagulants that could have caused this event. The platelets and PT/INR on admission were normal.",

They concluded that it was not clear whether this was due to the direct effect of virus on muscle tissue. The other possible mechanism proposed was the infection-mediated immune response that causing elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum resulting in skeletal muscle damage. However, it is important to note that patients in the severely ill group in addition to raised muscle enzymes , also had elevated liver enzymes and deranged renal functions which could have contributed to the this clinical picture . Moreover, no specific diagnostic workup for confirmation like NCS/EMG or muscle histopathology was performed.

            "text": "al from USA, documented chemosensory dysfunction in 59 COVID-19 positive and 203 COID-19 negative patients from a single center using an internet based cross sectional survey.28 They demonstrated that the smell and taste dysfunction was higher in the COVID-19 positive cases as compared to the negative cases. (smell loss:68% Vs.16 %and taste loss: 71% Vs. 17%). Most of the patients in this study were ambulatory, did not need hospitalization and none required mechanical ventilation. They theorized that probably in ambulatory COVID-19 patients virus spreads via the nasal route as compared to the seriously ill patients in which the spread is most likely pulmonary.Bagheri et al reported results of a large Iranian cohort of 10069 patients by employing an online questionnaire-based survey. 29 Participants were cases with problems in decreased sense of smell recently (within the last 04 weeks of onset of COVID-19 outbreak in Iran).Anosmia and hyposmia was reported by 48.23% of the respondents while 83.38% also had a decreased taste sensation. The onset of anosmia was sudden in76.24%. Other clinical features reported by the participants were flu or cold symptoms before anosmia (75.5%), headaches (48.6%), nasal stiffness (43.7%) and fever (37.3%). In contrast the study by Mao et al. in their cohort of 214 Chinese patients reported impairment of taste in 12 (5.6%) and impairment of smell in 11 (5.1%) patients. Anosmia and taste dysfunction were not reported in the French cohort of COVID-19 patients. Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) So far eight cases of COVID-19 associated GBS have been reported from China, Iran and Italy. Zhao et al reported the first case of GBS in a 61 years old female who had travelled to Wuhan City, China. 30 She presented with acute weakness in both legs and severe fatigue, progressing within 1 day. Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) and Electromyography (EMG) were suggestive of demyelinating polyneuropathy. She was treated with IVIG and later on developed respiratory symptoms. She tested positive for COVID-19.She infected two of her relatives and and eight other people including two neurologist and six nurses who were isolated but were found negative for COVID-19. The author concluded that based on the travel history, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia at the time of admission are consistent with a Para-infectious pattern of GBS due to COVID-19. She made a good motor recovery after isolation and administration of anti-virals.Sedaghat et al reported a 61 -Years old male with diabetes from Iran.31 He had cough, fever and sometimes dyspnea two weeks before presenting with ascending paralysis leading to quadriplegia and bilateral facial paralysis. NCS/EMG was suggestive of acute motor sensoryaxonal neuropathy. He was managed with IVIG. Authors have suggested that GBS should be considered as a neurological complication of COVID-19 since respiratory involvement is common in COVID-19 and can be a risk factor for development of GBS. Virani and colleagues reported GBS in a 54-Years male from USA.32 He presented with rapidly progressing ascending paralysis leading to respiratory difficulty. There was no bladder or bowel dysfunction. Reflexes were absent and MRI spine was normal. He had history of diarrhea preceding the acute attack of weakness.He tested positive for COVID-19. He was managed with IVIG and anti-malarial. He responded well and was weaned off from the ventilator. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy.Toscano et al reported five patients with GBS from Northern Italy.33 Lower-limb weakness and paresthesia were the main presenting features in four patients, followed by facial weakness, ataxia, and paresthesia in one patient. Four had positive PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab on initial visit and fifth one was initially negative but later turned positive. On NCS/EMG 02 patients had features of demyelinating polyneuropathy while three had axonal polyneuropathy. All the patients were treated with IVIG. It was repeated in 02 patients and one patient had plasma exchange. After one week, only one patient was able to ambulate independently and discharged from the hospital. Further large scale studies are required to prove this causal relationship between COVID-19 and GBS.",

Patients in the severely ill group were significantly older (58.2 \u00b1 15 years Vs. 48.9 \u00b1 14.7 years) with more co-morbid conditions especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%],).

However, nervous system symptoms were significantly more common in severe cases as compared with non-severe cases (40 [45.5%] vs. 38 [30.2%],).
