High-capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening, but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries, affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry, and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies, the applications of ACE span from lowaffinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity, e.g., in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies, e.g., for fast processing immunoassay. Also, approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte-ligand interaction for drug, immunoassay, and aptamer development are increasingly important, but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research. In addition, the present overview emphasizes that distinct challenges regarding sensitivity, parallel processing, information-rich detection, interfacing with MS, analyte recovery, and preparative capabilities remain. This will be addressed by future technological improvements that will ensure continuing new applications of ACE in the years to come.",

This was realized already back in the early days of electrophoresis (for historical notes, see, e.g., [1] ). Thus, moving boundary electrophoresis was used to characterize antigen-antibody interactions more than 50 years ago [2] . Modern day electrophoresis also uses affinity interactions to manipulate and optimize selectivity, and the capability of affinity electrophoresis to extract quantitative information about interacting systems is of significant value. Recently, affinity CE (ACE) has even begun to be used as a preparative tool. The chronology of affinity electrophoresis development after the proof-of-principle in the era of moving boundary electrophoresis consists of two phases corresponding to gel-based electrophoresis (see overviews in, e.g., [3, 4] ) and then to the advent of CE [5] [6] [7] .",

Additionally, we include both applications where affinity interactions are used as tools, e.g., to manipulate resolution or for preparative purposes, and applications where electrophoresis is used as a tool for characterizing interacting molecules.

Thus, it is of great interest to characterize antigen-antibody reactions, and electrophoresis may be readily used to separate bound from free immunoreagents. The development of CE for this purpose appears to be following two different trajectories. One is the quest to miniaturize immunoassays (lab-ona-chip) for simple, fast, and sensitive measurements in clinical settings. The other is the application of CE for the in-depth characterization of immunoreagents with respect to reactvity and binding strength, e.g., so that antibodies for specific applications can be tailor-made. An important issue in the miniaturization of immu-noassays is achieving suitable detection limits comparable to the performance of traditional ELISAs. In ELISA subpicomolar detection limits and parallel sample processing are standard [13] .",

Detection was achieved by means of LIF and reached a limit of about 1 ng/mL, corresponding to about 4 nM. In other work, chip-based CE for the analysis of human immunoglobulin using capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection [16] was demonstrated in a model system where also immunochemical reactions were performed. Contactless conductivity detection appears to be relatively sensitive (LODs for purified immonoglobulin M (IgM) were around 15 pM in conventional capillaries and 3.4 nM on chips), but the approach also requires lowconductance running buffers. While the preliminary results showed detection of immunocomplexes and free antigen, it remains to be seen if the method is too restricted with respect to running buffer conditions to be widely applicable for immunoassays. In another report on chip-based immunoassays, a sample throughput capability of 10-12 per hour for the simultaneous analysis of several cytokines directly from cerebrospinal fluid, at 1 pg/mL levels of detection limits, was achieved [17] . Importantly, the quantitation correlated very well with independent ELISA-based measurements. The analysis time was down to about 2 min per sample for the electrophoresis step, while the incubation and labeling steps prior to that totaled about 15 min. Since the bound analytes were here quantitated by electrophoresis after being eluted from the immunocapture port that is integrated into the chip, the approach is, strictly speaking, not an affinity electrophoresis method because no interactions take place during electrophoresis. Similar methods may be used in the process of developing and characterizing antibodies. An application -also based on immobilized antibody-antigen reaction prior to electrophoresis -was recently published by our group (supplemental material in [18] ). Here, the specificity of a mAb for structurally very similar antigens was ascertained by analyzing supernatants of antigen mixtures incubated with immobilized antibody. The high resolution of CE ensured separation of the protein species as well as the consumption of very little precious biological material. The use of immunoaffinity CE approaches for proteomics in general has recently been reviewed [19] . New quantitative binding studies of immunoreagents have confirmed the validity of CE-derived binding constants by comparison with independent techniques such as surface plasmon resonance measurements [20] . In this study a singe-chain variable fragment antibody reacting with fluorescently labeled C4 complement protein was evaluated. It is one of the few CE-based studies of inter-actions between two proteins that are both .25 000 in molecular mass. A K D of 15-30 nM was estimated by both the SPR and CE methods.",

            "text": "The analysis of proteins by CE has always been troubled by adsorption problems, and this is also evident in CEbased binding studies with proteins. Much effort is spent on working out conditions for reproducible protein analysis before embarking on the binding studies themselves. A typical problem is that the best conditions for CE-based protein separations (e.g., acidic pH) are rarely the most suitable conditions for studying physiologically relevant binding interactions. In some cases low-affinity interactions can be utilized to make peptides and proteins analyzable under suitable buffer conditions. The way such buffer additives are used is different from wallshielding dynamic coating additives [21] , where interactions with the analytes are highly undesired. The new types of additives are meant to complex with the analytes and thereby shield them from wall binding. An example of both mechanisms described in one paper [22] is the use of mono-and diquaternized diamines for peptide and protein separations. This approach mainly improved peptide recovery, while the analysis of larger peptides/whole proteins still was questionable. In the case of a specific protein analyte, the glycosaminoglycan-binding plasma protein b 2 -glycoprotein I, the socalled pH-hysteresis effect of uncoated fused-silica capillaries [23, 24] was exploited. In this way reproducible analyte recovery was achieved at neutral pH and binding studies could be carried out [25] . The pH-hysteresis effect refers to the slow deprotonization of silanol groups when brought to neutral pH from the acidic side compared with the faster equilibration when coming from the alkaline side. It is achieved, e.g., simply by flushing the capillary with 0.1 M HCl prior to running the CE analysis. This gives a slower electroendosmotic flow and a decreased tendency for positively charged analytes to stick to the capillary walls under the very same running buffer conditions that are incompatible with analyte recovery when preceding the run with an alkaline flush.",

Using the regular quartet sequence, it was possible to resolve the peptides better than in a bare capillary under otherwise identical conditions. It could be shown that some amino acid combinations in the dipeptides had a higher binding than others. Thus, these amino acid motifs were possibly involved in the separation of proteins achievable by open-tubular CEC using quadruplex DNA as a stationary phase [28] . There is an affinity continuum from these selectivity enhancing oligonucleotide structures that has no affinity for specific proteins to the very specific, highaffinity artificial DNA and RNA sequences called aptamers. Aptamers are defined as DNA/RNA molecules that have been selected from random pools based on their ability to bind ligands. They are combinatorially developed to bind specific targets and often contain G-quartet motifs, as is, e.g., the case for the thrombin-binding aptamer originally described more than 10 years ago [29] . The use of aptamers in ACE is reviewed in more detail in Section 9.",

The lipid binding of apolipoproteins was studied using an ACE approach with negatively charged phospholipid vesicles added to the physiological electrophoresis buffer [45] . Unilamellar vesicles resembling cell membranes were found more suitable for binding studies than multilamellar vesicles and liposomes. A quantitative binding theory taking into account the possibility of many protein molecules binding per vesicle (vesicle surface area may be 1000-fold larger than the surface area of the protein analyte) was worked out. It was shown that the extracted binding constant values and values for the number of protein molecules bound per vesicle correlated quite well with measurements using independent techniques.

Emerging subfields are the characterization of small molecular ion-DNA interactions [51] , and the characterization of drug-DNA/RNA interactions. M-DNA (DNA complexes with divalent metal ions) was characterized by CE in an attempt to understand the poor performance of CE when samples containing DNA and metal ions are analyzed [52] . The chiral characteristics of transition metal complexes were shown to be analyzable by CE, because the enantiomeric affinities toward calf thymus DNA is differential [53] . CE was also used to measure the 10 4 -10 5 /M binding constants of Fe 21 and Fe 31 -ions interacting with duplex DNA [54] . This was performed in conjunction with Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy to evaluate conformational changes. In another study by the same group, DNA interactions with polyamines and cobalt(III)hexamine were characterized. Information on the mechanisms of polyamine-induced DNA condensa-tion and duplex stabilization in vivo including different degree of protection afforded by different types of polyamines was obtained [55] .",

In this study, the method was used to separate point mutated from normal CYP2C9 DNA. SNP analysis is one area where microarray analyses may encounter problems because single-base mismatches do not typically prevent dsDNA formation. This creates a need for CE-based, discriminatory analyses, and the study utilized the ability of the weakly interacting polyacrylamide-based affinity matrix to achieve differential migration without binding any of the target DNA too strongly.

They analyzed the interaction of 13 anionic, neutral, and cationic drugs with HSA at near physiological conditions.

In drug development, FA may require drug concentrations of 10 mM or lower. This approaches the limit of the normal UV detectors. Wan et al. [73] instead utilized MS for detection in drug-HSA/plasma interaction measurements. Where normal CE-FA methods require repetitive analyses of drug standards in order to obtain a calibration curve, the authors combined the standard run with the drug-protein analysis in a single run by first injecting a standard drug immediately followed by the drug-protein mixture. The mass spectrometer gave better sensitivity for protein binding at low drug concentrations, but required volatile buffers in order not to be affected by ionic suppression from usual CE running buffers. Thus, the interfacing CE with MS is still not routine. The authors assumed a one-to-one model with first-order dissociation for quantifying the obtained binding data. They found good agreement with plasma binding measured by UV and MS regardless of drug concentration and buffer type, although the reproducibility of the UV traces were more consistent due to smoother peak plateaus. MS as a sen-sitive detector seems promising in CE-FA analyses although problems with time-dependent losses of lowand medium-binding drugs at low concentrations in the system also need to be addressed.",

A number of examples are included in Table 1 , and recent exhaustive reviews on this subfield including new insights into the separation mechanisms may also be consulted [78] [79] [80] . In Section 12 some new developments in chiral affinity separation theory are reviewed. Regarding applications, an interesting new contribution deals with titrating concentrations of highly charged chiral selectors (sulfated CDs) to a point where two drug enantiomers migrate in opposite directions without the requirement of counter pressure [81] . This, in principle, provides for infinite resolution capabilities and makes the use of ultrashort partial-filling approaches (zone lengths in the order of 5 mm in a 64.5 cm long capillary), and thus CE-MS methods, feasible. In another study, good resolution and impressive detection limit enhancements were achieved by using chiral temperature gradient focusing. Here, temperature-dependent ionic strength buffers were employed to move analytes to zero-velocity points in the separation path exposed to the temperature gradient. By this procedure, analytes were separated and concentrated efficiently. When combined with chiral selectors it was possible to temperature-focus highly concentrated enantiomeric species at different positions in very short separation channels (lengths on the order of mm) albeit at low peak capacity. The approach would seem very well suited for chip-based technologies [82] .",

New work in this field deals with better and more efficient simulations, with the extraction of thermodynamic data, and with situations that do not conform to the standard assumptions in ACE. The latter include experiments involving more than one class of binding interactions, nonequilibrium conditions in dynamic ACE, ligand binding with no analyte mobility shifts, the presence of cooperative binding, and ligand added at a concentration that is not much higher than the analyte concentration. Simulation of ACE may use different methods for modeling the electrophoretic migration, and usually requires the application of a large number of differential equations. However, a recent study [99] showed that by assuming constant local field strength and by considering only the analyte and additive ions in the modeling, the computing time and memory requirements can be reduced significantly. A new algorithm reduced computing time by more than 90% and was able to simulate both equilibrium and nonequilibrium (preincubation) ACE. The method requires prior knowledge of binding and rate constants for simulations, but may be used to predict peak appearance times and peak shapes of real ACE experiments. In further work by the same group [100] , simulation procedures were brought even closer to practical use. An enumeration algorithm that extracts combinations of binding constant and complex mobility from 3-D surfaces into 2-D plots under different experimental conditions was used to estimate accurate binding constants and complex mobilities from as few as two or three sets of ACE experiments. The approach had the added advantage that it works also for other than 1:1 binding stoichiometries.",

The mobility moment (the average mobility of the detected analyte (reflecting the relative amounts of the free and complexed form of the analyte)) is plotted against antigen concentration and yields a binding constant value corresponding well with the outcome of plots of complex peak height against antigen concentration. This type of analysis cancels out contributions from differences in total amount of analyte from the analysis and also is not affected by fluorescence quenching or enhancement upon complexation. Additionally, it does not require assignment of peak species and this means, in cases where detection limits are critical, that large analyte plugs may be injected.

The basic notion is that dissociating complexes from low-stability preequilibrated samples are observed as peak tailing between the complex peak and the peak representing free species. The tailing directly represents the unimolecular exponential decrease of dissociated complex, and the dissociation rate constant can therefore be calculated by analysis of the tailing curve. The approach has been named NECEEM [104] . The main prerequisite for this approach to work is that there is a quick and good separation between complexed and free species. In contrast to almost all other quantitative CEbased binding studies the method only requires a single experiment to yield dissociation rate and equilibrium dissociation binding constants using, e.g., simple Excel programs for the computing. This makes it simple to carry out series of experiments as, e.g., temperature experiments for studying the interplay between binding rates and temperature to extract thermodynamic parameters [58] . Also, the approach has been used as a chemical thermometer that noninvasively documented the temperature inside capillaries during CE in different instruments. It could be demonstrated that passive heat exchange (e.g., air cooling) were less well suited for temperature-sensitive analyses than active heat-dissipation systems [105] .",

This was based on migration time data, amount of protein loaded, and capillary radius. The study emphasized the relative importance of the absolute amounts of selector present in the system over plug length or selector mobility, and the authors recommended the use of low selector concentrations in long plugs [106] . It is theoretically possible to achieve an enantioseparation by CE even when the binding affinity of the selector for both enantiomers is equal. This may be possible if complex mobilities are different because of slight differences in ionization values, shape, size, lipophilicity, polarity, and solubility as summarized and tabulated recently [107] . Rational development and optimization of chiral separation conditions benefit from multivariate/multifactorial analyses as shown in several recent studies [108, 109] .

[110] used FA with LIF detection in a study of the apomyoglobin-complexing fluorophore Coumarin 153 to probe the overall solvation dynamics of the protein in polar solvents. The dissociation constants estimated by this method correlated well with other methods and confirmed a fairly strong binding of the fluorophore to apomyoglobin. CE with LIF detection was also exploited in a study of the interaction of Ca 21 with calcium-binding proteins in complex biological systems [111] . Here the authors studied the binding of Ca 21 to an E. coli expressed construct of green fluorescent protein (GFP) spliced to calmodulin, as well as the ensuing interaction with OsCBK, a high-affinity CaM-binding protein kinase. GFP was found to be a superior probe compared to chemical labels because it is stable and does not alter the Ca 21binding characteristics of CaM or the CaM-OsCBK complex. Also, it works well under physiological pH and ionic strength conditions. An interesting approach for exploiting the higher sensitivity of fluorescence detection is fluorescence ansiotropy/ polarization detection [112] which may also be used for quantitative analysis of noncovalent interactions [113, 114] . The detection principle is based on small fluorescent molecules with low anisotropy added to the electrophoresis buffer to probe for analyte binding. When bound in a complex with larger molecules, the probe molecules tumble less than when they rotate as unbound molecules, and this difference can be detected (as an anisotropy shift) by a polarized fluorescence detector. Thus, the method does not rely on mobility shifts for detection of binding. Whelan et al. [113] used the principle for studies of the binding of G protein isoforms using BODIPY FL GTPgS as the small fluorescent ligand probe. A high sensitivity at low probe concentrations (LOD 3 nM for G ai1 ) was achieved. In applying the approach a balance exists between choosing as low a probe concentration as possible (for achieving high sensitivity) and high probe concentrations that provide a higher dynamic range for detection of binding. In [114] fluorescence anisotropy CE and affinity-probe CE with LIF detection were compared for characterizing the rapid kinetics of the binding of the Src-homology 2 domain of the SH2-Bb protein to a fluorescently labeled phosphorylated peptide (corresponding to the binding site of JAK2). Both approaches achieved relatively good LODs (100 nM (12 amol) and 300 nM (7.5 fmol)), respectively). The separation times were as short as 4 s which was suitable for the very rapid dissociation kinetics in the affinity probe CE experiments that were used to estimate the binding kinetics. Comparing the two methods, the resolution of multiple protein species seemed to be better in the fluorescence anisotropy CE experiments which, however, were used only for qualitative estimates of binding interactions in this study. The advances in contactless conductivity detection must also be considered an important technical development and have been described in Section 3.",

It was concluded that CE-MS is a valuable tool by combining affinity separation with accurate mass determination, but it was found that binding constants could only be reliably calculated in this system based on the CE-UV data. The use of inductively coupled plasma MS as mentioned in Section 10 is a promising approach for metal-specific detection in studies of metal-containing analytes. However, in general CE-MS is still technically challenging and only the invention of practical and simple interfacing technologies will release the significant potential of ACE-MS.",

            "text": "Miniaturization is also a continued focus for technological innovations within ACE (cf. also Section 3 on immunochemistry). The development of a fast analysis, i.e., high-throughput screening together with binding data is attractive but still in the prototype phase. Stettler et al. [118] compared chip-based systems with UV and electrochemical detection with traditional CE-UV using the interaction between the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine and CD in solution as a model application. The affinity microchip-CE system showed proofof-principle ACE in qualitative terms, especially at lower CD concentrations, but was hampered by peak broadening. A number of immobilization strategies that originate from developments in affinity chromatography have been transferred to electrophoretic separation capillaries in preliminary applications. One example is Tsukagoshi et al. [119] who immobilized metal chelate affinity functional groups in silica capillaries. The inner wall was derivatized with polymerized N-(vinylbenzylimino)diacetic acid, and two modified surfaces were prepared: iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and Cu(II)-IDA. The modification did not eliminate the EOF. Immobilized metal ACE (IMACE) in the Cu 21capillary was applied to the analysis of purified HSA and gammaglobulin that were found to interact differentially with the fixed metal groups on the wall. Since these two analytes display very different pIs and thus can easily be separated, future work using more similar analytes, e.g., protein isoforms, is anticipated. More novel developments within the fields of immobilized affinity groups and new coatings are expected to originate from the interplay between the areas of LC, CEC, and CE.",

            "text": "While the applicability of ACE is still challenged by technical limitations, it is now used quite broadly in analytical chemistry and the biological sciences as is apparent from above. The limitations chiefly concern analyte recovery, peak identification, limits in parallel processing, and in understanding the interplay between binding rates and separation parameters. Perhaps the most limiting factor for using the technique outside specialist laboratories is the fact that ACE is not one, but a suite of different techniques united by a capillary electrophoretic separation step. Therefore, its particular embodiment in specific applications depends on the questions and interacting systems to be examined. This is amply illustrated by the numerous modes of ACE used in the publications cited in this review. Despite the obstacles to being a universal systems biology tool, affinity interactions and CE will be increasingly integrated in many functional biology studies. CE will also find continued use as an analytical and preparative tool during development of specific binding reagents including immunoreagents such as mAbs, in vitro affinity-maturated single-chain Fv-fragments, and phage displayed variable regions as well as aptamers and chemical libraries. Also the functional and structural assessment of drugs and novel drug candidates will entail a growing use of ACE. Additionally, the specific area of protein conformational studies, which is important for, e.g., biological drug development and for the understanding of disease, will continue to benefit from CE which is complementary to NMR-and MS-based methods in this field. Finally, technical innovations will continue in the areas outlined above, and to the extent that these are simple and easily accessible, the usefulness of combining affinity interactions with CE analyses will be increasingly obvious.",
