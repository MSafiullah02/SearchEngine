SARS is caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which has a positive-strand RNA genome of approximately 30 kb in length with a 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 poly(A) tail.1, 2 Coronaviruses have been subdivided into three phylogenetic groups. Groups 1 and 2 infect mammals, usually resulting in only a mild respiratory distress. Group 3 infects birds and includes the causative agent of a severe disease that is economically significant for the poultry industry.3, 4 Analysis of the complete genomes of over a dozen SARS-CoV isolates from around the world indicate that SARS-CoV is not a mutant or a recombinant of known coronaviruses, but a novel one that acquired the ability to infect humans.5 Isolation of a nearly identical coronavirus from civet cats, raccoon dogs, and badgers, suggests SARS-CoV jumped species from its natural animal host to humans.6\n",

Indeed, three such proteins have been identified by sequence homology: Nsp14, a putative exonuclease; Nsp15, an endoribonuclease; and Nsp16, a putative RNA methyltransferase.11, 12 Recently, we confirmed the predicted function for SARS-CoV Nsp15, and showed that its activity was enhanced by Mn2+ and that cleavage was specific for uridylate residues.13 Similar results were reported by Ivanov et al.,14 who also demonstrated that the Nsp15 ortholog of human coronavirus was essential for virus replication. RNA endoribonuclease activity is unusual among plus-strand RNA viruses, suggesting that it could be a target for antiviral development. In addition, the high specificity for unpaired uridylate residues suggests that Nsp15 could be used to study RNA structure and function.",

It may also be significant that yields of three of these inactive proteins (H234A, H249A, and K289A) were approximately 1000-fold higher than wild-type protein (data not shown), suggesting that they were less toxic to bacteria. D272A was synthesized at levels equivalent to the histidine and lysine mutants, but was mostly insoluble. Thus, the final yield of D272A was low, but the high level of synthesis suggested that it was also not toxic to cells due to its complete lack of activity. Bacteria harboring these four expression plasmids also grew faster than those with wild-type plasmid or the other substitutions, suggesting that even a low-level expression of active protein was detrimental to the cells.

When analyzed at 0.1 \u03bcM in the absence of Mn2+, wild-type Nsp15 sedimented as two distinct species of 6.3 S and 1.8 S, which are labeled H and M, respectively, in Figure 4(a). The molecular mass was determined by direct fitting with the Lamm equation, and the derived values were within 8% of that expected for monomers (40.8 kDa) and 1% of the predicted hexamer molecular mass (285 kDa). We previously showed that wild-type Nsp15 underwent a large conformational change when titrated with Mn2+, but not Mg2+, by change in intrinsic fluorescence of Nsp15.13 Therefore, we tested the addition of 10 mM Mn2+ to see if oligomerization was responsible for this shift. We found that Mn2+ changed the proportion of hexamers from 63% to 66%, indicating that alterations in oligomerization was probably not responsible for the decreased intrinsic fluorescence observed previously. Gel-filtration chromatography performed in the presence of 5 mM Mn2+ also caused only a slight shift from monomer to hexamer, confirming that Mn2+ has only a minor effect on the oligomerization state (data not shown). When Nsp15 was examined for the ratio of monomers and hexamers at higher protein concentration (1 \u03bcM), however, the relative amount of hexamer increased to 85% (Figure 4(b)). These results indicate that protein concentration strongly affected the equilibrium between the monomeric and hexameric states of the protein, while Mn2+ primarily affected the local conformation within monomer units.",

Mutant K289A was chosen for these studies because it was expressed abundantly and appeared to have a tighter subunit association. The electron micrograph in Figure 6\n(a) shows a homogeneous and monodisperse population of K289A single particles that are well separated. Single-particle analysis revealed a large number of elongated square-shaped projections and a lesser amount of circular projections exhibiting a pronounced central pore (Figure 6(b)). Two thousand particles were selected and grouped into subclasses as representing various views for 3D reconstruction. During the fifth iterative refinement, the data began to converge and after the eighth refinement cycle, no further improvement was achieved (Figure 7\n(c)). Although there was a scarcity of face-on projections, as shown by the asymmetric triangle (Figure 6(d)), there was a large number of different side-on views thus permitting a 3D reconstruction (Figure 6(e)). The validation of the reconstruction is, however, critically dependent on choosing the correct point group symmetry. Analysis of the symmetry of the 2D crystals (Figure 7) aided this process greatly. The symmetry of the lattices formed was determined to be consistent with a p3 plane group. While the projection map (Figure 7(c)) displays six density maxima per unit cell, the overall distribution of the protein mass followed a triangular arrangement. In addition, there was good agreement between the projection map and the 3D reconstruction when viewed face-on (Figure 6(e)). The large number of side-on views also supported the idea that Nsp15 has a two-layered structure. Together with the overall dimensions of Nsp15 (9 nm wide and 11 nm tall), this could explain why the molecules preferentially lie on their sides on the carbon support film. Since the face-on projections display 3-fold rotational symmetry, and that the two-layered side-on projections display 2-fold symmetry, we conclude the point group symmetry is D3, making Nsp15 a hexamer consisting of two trimeric rings on top of each other. These findings are in excellent agreement with the biochemical data showing that one form of Nsp15 is a hexamer.",

One of these domains is involved in providing inter-trimeric contacts. (ii) A third domain that contributes to the pronounced central density (arrow in Figure 7(e)), may serve as a contact point for all six subunits, therefore enhancing the interactions within each trimeric ring as well as between the two trimers.

Importantly, the fact that E3 enzymatic activity was restored at higher protein concentrations argues for the higher-order structure being the enzymatically relevant one. Lastly, the mutant proteins that retained enzymatic activity also retained the ability to form hexamers in the native gel electrophoresis assay. These results argue that the hexamer is the enzymatically active state for the SARS-CoV Nsp15 protein.

However, this is likely due to the harsh treatment of the enzyme with 50% (v/v) acetic acid.16 One other exception is RNase PH, an exonuclease that processes the 3\u2032 end of tRNAs.17 This enzyme also forms a hexameric ring, but it is a trimer of dimers. Similar to our observations of the Nsp15 E3A, mutagenesis of residues essential for hexamer formation decreased the enzymatic activity of RNase PH. E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase and the yeast exosome are trimeric nucleases, where each monomer contains two repeats of an RNase PH-like domain.18, 19 Hexameric rings of these molecules preclude entry of double-stranded RNA into the active site, indicating that specificity is at least partially structure-dependent.17, 18, 19 Nsp15, which cleaves at uridylate residues, has a preference for unpaired residues (K.B. et al., unpublished results), suggesting that structure may be an important determinant for substrate recognition by Nsp15.",

            "text": "Currently, the role of Nsp15 in the coronavirus infection process is unknown. Several possibilities can be imagined. First, Nsp15 could be involved in SARS-CoV sub-genomic RNA synthesis. If SARS-CoV synthesizes sub-genomic RNAs by discontinuous extension of negative strands as proposed by Sawicki & Sawicki,9 an endoribonuclease could help untether the ternary replication complex and facilitate its translocation to the leader sequence. There is precedence for such activities in viruses. An analogous nuclease activity plays a role in retrovirus replication. The RNase H activity that degrades the RNA portion of an RNA/DNA duplex releases the polymerase complex at a strong-stop sequence, after the initial round of synthesis from the tRNA primer.20 Alternatively, if SARS uses the leader-prime mechanism for synthesis of subgenomic RNAs,21 the nascent leader RNA could be processed by Nsp15 for use in sub-genomic synthesis. Second, Nsp15 could be involved in degradation of the minus-strand RNA. Coronavirus minus-strand RNA is highly unstable and Wang & Sawicki22 have speculated that turnover of minus-strands regulates plus-strand RNA synthesis and decreases recognition by cellular surveillance systems that target the dsRNA intermediate. In support of this idea, it has been shown that minus-strand RNA initiates with a polyuridylate stretch,23 a sequence that should readily be cleaved by Nsp15. Instead of, or in addition to, possible roles for Nsp15 in viral nucleic acid synthesis, Nsp15 could digest cellular RNAs, either to disrupt cellular functions or to prevent synthesis of antiviral and proapoptotic proteins. There is precedence for this in a positive-strand RNA virus. The pestiviral structural glycoprotein Erns is also an endoribonuclease that can negatively affect dsRNAs that are inducers of the interferon beta response.24 A final possibility is that Nsp15 has evolved in order to disrupt the function of the cellular homolog, EndoU, which is required for the processing of snoRNAs from their precursor RNAs.25 The Nsp15 mutations analyzed in this study will be valuable as a guide to understanding the roles of Nsp15 in vivo studies. In addition, Nsp15 structural studies should benefit from the availability of mutant proteins that are defective for hexamer formation, such as E3A, and the mutants that can form hexamers, but are inactive for endoribonuclease activity.",
