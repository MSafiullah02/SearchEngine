HFNO and NIPPV both risk aerosolization of upper airway droplets that contain viral particles. Prior SARS experience revealed that more than 90% of patients initially managed with NIPPV failed this approach and required endotracheal intubation.\n7\n Given the high risk of failure of noninvasive respiratory support and the risk of aerosolization of viral particles, we advocate for early intubation in COVID\u201019 patients with respiratory failure. Early intubation should be considered in these patients if any of the following are present: Persistent tachypnea (RR > 25), marginal oxygen saturations (90\u201092%) despite supplemental oxygenation, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, sepsis physiology, or a trajectory of increasing respiratory distress despite medical management.",

This can be accomplished by using a tight\u2010fitting NIPPV mask connected to an in\u2010line HEPA filter and a closed dual\u2010limb ventilator circuit.

Continue positive pressure preoxygenation until the patient is apneic, then suspend the ventilator before removing the mask to prevent aerosolization. Consistent mask fit is important to both increase the quality of preoxygenation and reduce the degree of leak.
