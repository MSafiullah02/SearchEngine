Asthma was diagnosed on the basis of the National Asthma\nEducation and Prevention Program guidelines [8]. All other episodes of acute expiratory wheezing\nwere considered to be recurrent wheezing. Acute expiratory wheezing was\nconsidered to be bronchiolitis when it occurred for the first time in children\naged under 2 years. Laryngotracheobronchitis was associated with inspiratory\ndyspnea and wheezing. Laryngitis was associated with inspiratory dyspnea without\nwheezing. Cases with both focal infiltrates and consolidation in chest X-rays\nwere, in the absence of wheezing, classified as pneumonia.",
