Social (or physical) distancing is achieved by a deliberate increase in the physical space, typically 6 ft or greater, between persons to reduce or eliminate the transmission of coronavirus. 1 Wearing a surgical mask or custom cloth face mask, when social (or physical) distancing cannot occur, also is recommended to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. Specific recommended elements of social (or physical) distancing include working from home instead of at the office, converting educational platforms from residential programs to online classes, and canceling or postponing conferences. Omer et al 1 have commented on the ill effects of long-term social distancing, such as poor mental and physical health and a declining world economy. To these ill effects, I add the negative implications on the educational process in OMS, specifically detrimental educational engagement. Stated differently, social and physical isolationism is intuitively disadvantageous to educational engagement and, therefore, effective education in general.",

            "text": "Engagement in learning environments has been formally defined as a learner's interest and participation in an educational initiative and is directly related to favorable educational outcomes including learning and behavioral change. 2 Nonetheless, engagement is one of the most widely misused, poorly understood, and overgeneralized constructs in learning. The concept of engagement is pontificated about and debated by educators of all disciplines. This notwithstanding, engagement can be experientially described as the recruitment of interest, the sustaining of effort and persistence, and the execution of self-regulation, all in the best interests of active (deep) learning. Stated differently, educational engagement takes place based on a framework of emotion. Emotions engage the brain and body. Emotions dictate what we seek, attend, perceive, and remember in terms of our education. Emotions represent motivating signals whereby a learner proclaims to the brain that something is worth learning and applying. Engagement permits the transfer of information from didactic teaching to lifetime application. Therein, lifelong learning probably represents the quintessential example of educational engagement. Engagement, however, depends on a wholly dichotomous relationship. The teacher must be engaged in teaching, and the student must be simultaneously engaged in learning. One engaged party without the other or, worse, neither party being engaged inevitably produces failure in the learning 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57 process. When properly executed, interactive teaching, specifically the Socratic method of teaching 3 with emotional intelligence, 4 is a prime example of educational engagement. Although Socratic teaching is traditionally performed as part of in-person education, experience shows that it can be accomplished virtually. Under ideal circumstances, learning is accomplished with interpersonal contact to ensure effective engagement. An impersonal review of a PowerPoint presentation (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) by a learner rather than delivery by a lecturer, for example, refutes educational engagement and represents a passive (superficial), rather than active (deep), learning experience.",

Such interpersonal contact permits teachers to perceive and appreciate effective learning by students by recognizing eye contact, head nods, and voice inflection and by students asking teachers thoughtful and insightful questions, thereby establishing and reinforcing engagement in the learning process. Educational engagement, therefore, involves 2 types of thinking, with executive thinking permitting the most effective form of educational engagement ( Table 1) .",

To this end, 7 signs of educational engagement must be assessed objectively. First and foremost, signs of goal setting by the resident must be observed by the faculty member. In doing so, there must be recognition by the faculty member of challenges established as goals by the resident. Second, signs of deeper information must be perceived whereby processing occurs as an investment in future performance. These signs can include note taking and highlighting of text by the resident with thoughtful reflection and retention. Third, the transfer of learned information can be measured as a sign of deliberate practice. Fourth, measuring signs of elaboration such as feedback and interactive discussion must take place. Fifth, signs of help seeking must exist. Interactive residents who seek assistance typically show more favorable educational outcomes than residents who do not seek assistance. Sixth, signs of selfchecking must be assessed. Introspective residents who inquire of themselves as to their active learning are defining elements of educational engagement. Finally, signs of the resident's selfregulation (ongoing inner conversation) are important to ensure an effective educational engagement process.",
