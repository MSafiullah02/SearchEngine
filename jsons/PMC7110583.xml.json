            "text": "Many DNA and RNA viruses depend on the host nuclear proteins for their replication [11]. Several strategies are used by viruses in order to deliver its genome to the host cells [12]. Usually, when cells undergo mitosis, there is a temporary disassembly of the nuclear envelope (NE) which allows some viruses to enter into the nucleus [13]. Entry and integration of murine leukemia virus (MLV) into host nucleus depends on the NE breakdown during mitosis [14]. Various human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-integration complex proteins, such as the matrix [15], Vpr [16], integrase [17], [18] were found to contain nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their genome sequence. This NLS interacts with the nuclear transport receptors, which transports the viral proteins through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Similarly, the influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) present in the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) contains NLS1, NLS2 and NLS3, which helps in its binding to cellular importins resulting in transportation of the vRNP to the nucleus [19], [20], [21].",

            "text": "In another strategy, the capsid of certain viruses gets attached to the cytoplasmic side of the host NPC either directly or with the help of importins. This interaction acts as a signal for capsid disassembly followed by entry of the viral genome along with their proteins through the NPC into the nucleus [12]. Studies on the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection on Vero, BHK-21 and PtK2 cells reported transportation of viral tegument-capsid by dynein to the cytoplasmic side of NPC [22], [23]. The HSV-1 capsid binds to NPC with the help of importin \u03b2 and subsequently releases DNA into the nucleus through the NPC [24]. Similarly, the capsid protein of adenovirus (Ad) on binding with the nuclear transport protein Nup214 attaches to the cytoplasmic side of NPC and releases the genetic material into the nucleus [25]. Some small viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), baculovirus, etc were found to cross the NPC and release their genome at the nuclear side of NPC or within the nucleus [12]. The capsid protein of HBV was reported to interact with NPC via the nuclear receptor Nup153 in Xenopus laevis oocytes [26]. Furthermore, this binding depends on importin \u03b1, \u03b2 and phosphorylated core protein present on its capsid [27]. Upon infection, HBV capsid enters the nucleus through the NPC and subsequently releases its genome into the nucleoplasm [28]. Similarly, capsid proteins of simian virus 40 (SV40) were found to enter the nucleus through NPC [29]. It has been reported that the disruption of the NE and nuclear lamina temporarily aid the nuclear entry of viruses such as parvoviruses [30]. Disruption of NE in Xenopus oocytes and both NE and nuclear lamina in mouse fibroblast cells upon parvovirus infection and minute virus of mice (MVM) was reported using electron microscopy analysis [30], [31]. Presumably, viruses evolved different mechanisms to enter nucleus in order to facilitate their replication cycle and survivability inside the host cells.",

            "text": "After the successful entry into the nucleus, both DNA and RNA viruses exploit various nuclear components such as nucleolus, promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear body (PLN) and/or nuclear proteins in order to facilitate their replication (Fig. 2\n) [11]. Nucleolin, fibrillarin and B23 (nucleophosmin) are examples of nucleolar proteins reported essential for various functions like post transcriptional process, ribosome assembly, etc\n[32]. These multifunctional host nucleolar proteins were reported to be incorporated into the replication and translation complex of many viruses [11]. Many DNA viruses like HSV and Ad were reported to be involved in relocalization or disruption of the host nucleolar proteins [11]. For instance, the transfection of the recombinant UL24 protein of HSV-1, tagged with an N-terminal hemagglutinin in Vero cells resulted in the redistribution of nucleolin and B23 [33], [34]. Another nucleolar protein fibrillarin was also found to be redistributed in spots throughout the nucleus but in an UL24 independent manner [33]. The core protein of Ad was found to be associated with the nucleolus in HeLa cells [35]. Further studies showed that this association results in the relocation of the nucleolin to the cytoplasm of the infected cells [36]. The Ad-induced relocation of nucleolin was proposed to be a strategy used by virus to suppress its activity [36]. Additionally, infection of HeLa cells with Ad resulted in inhibition of synthesis and maturation of rRNA [37].",

            "text": "Nucleolar localization of the viral capsid and RNA binding proteins of many RNA viruses has been reported [11]. For example, the encephalomyocarditis viral (EMCV) proteins 2A and 3BCD and human rhinovirus HRV 3C protease were found to localize to the nucleoli resulting in inhibition of cellular RNA transcription [38], [39]. It has been reported that the expression of Tat and Rev proteins of HIV-1 in COS7 cells resulted in their accumulation in dense fibrillar component in the nucleolus [40]. Moreover, Rev protein was reported to be involved in deforming the nucleolar architecture [40]. Similarly, the viral N protein was found to be localized to the nucleolus in addition to the cytoplasm upon infection of coronavirus resulting in delayed cell cycle to facilitate viral assembly [41]. Poliovirus (PV) or rhinoviruses interact with nucleolin and blocks the nuclear import leading to accumulation of nucleolin in the cytoplasm of the infected cells [42]. The accumulated nucleolin interacts with the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element present in the upstream 5\u2032 end of the viral genome to stimulate its translation [43]. On the other hand, these changes result in the shutdown of cellular transcription leading to the downregulation of the host defence mechanism [42]. Infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) in A549 cells resulted in depletion of nucleolin [44]. Although, both DNA and RNA viruses behave differently towards acquiring the nuclear niche however the goal being to establish control over cellular transcription and favour its genome over the host.",

These proteins are induced by interferons and hence PML NB can act as a target for viruses to escape the antiviral signalling response [45]. Redistribution of the PML NB has been reported upon infection of HSV-1 to BHK-21 cells [46]. Similarly, EBNA LP protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was found to displace Sp100 from PML NBs in Burkitt's lymphoma and Hep2 cells [47]. The viral E4-ORF3 protein induced reorganization of PML NBs into elongated track like structures upon infection of CV1 cells with human Ad5 [48]. Later, it was found that this reorganization was responsible for the downregulation of the host antiviral response [49]. Another example is the infection of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) resulting in the accumulation of pp71 at PML NBs in the infected cells [50]. Further studies showed that pp71 was responsible for the proteasomal degradation of PML-NB protein Daxx, which is important for inducing intrinsic immune response against HCMV infection [50]. Some RNA viruses also result in the redistribution and degradation of host PML NBs in order to neutralize the antiviral response. The RING finger protein Z of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus interacts with PML protein and leads to the redistribution of PML-NBs from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm [51]. The expression of 3C protease of EMCV in CHO cells was reported to target PML-NBs and promote its degradation in proteasome and by SUMO-dependent mechanism [52]. Interestingly, CHO cells infected with rabies virus were reported to contain enlarged PML NBs [53].",

The large malleable surface of the ER aids viruses to form protective compartments to set up their replication machinery. These compartments known as viroplasm not only concentrate viral and host proteins required for viral genome replication but also protect the viral genome from cellular nucleases [58]. In order to construct these compartments, viruses alter host's fatty acid metabolism, induce rearrangement of the membrane constituents and also recruit cellular machinery to produce proteins essential for its replication [59], [60]. Infection of vaccinia virus (VACV) in BS-C-1, HeLa and RK-13 cells leads to the formation of VACV membranes derived from the ER membrane [61]. In case of dengue virus (DENV-2), the genomic RNA was observed to localize over the rough ER in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells [62]. DENV infection in Human hepatoma 7 (Huh7) cells leads to invagination of ER membrane resulting in the formation of spherules or vesicles containing double stranded RNA [63]. HeLa cells and COS-1 cells on infection with PV 1 cause formation of single membrane tubules which later mature into double membrane vesicles (DMVs) [64], [65]. Similarly, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) induced formation of ER derived DMVs upon infection of Vero cells [66], [67]. Zippered appearance of ER was observed upon infection of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) on mammalian, avian and tracheal epithelial cells [68]. Studies with the plant viruses like the potato virus X (PVX) reported TGBp2 protein induced reorganization of the ER and appearance of vesicular structures in tobacco plants [69]. Effect of the viral protein expression on sterol biosynthesis apart from the alterations in ER morphology have also been reported [59], [70].",

            "text": "Several viral proteins need to be glycosylated at their N-terminal to ensure proper folding and for the incorporation into virions [71]. Hence, a common phenomenon observed upon viral infection is interference with the host post translational machinery and competition with the cellular proteins to undergo these modifications [72]. For example, protein pORF2 of hepatitis E virus (HEV) gets glycosylated in the ER upon its expression in COS-1 cells and Huh7 mammalian cells [73], [74]. This increased biosynthetic load is proposed to increase in accumulation of malformed proteins resulting in ER stress (Fig. 2). ER gets relieved from this stress by inducing a pathway called unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway [72]. UPR serves to enhance the cell's degradation ability in order to establish ER homeostasis [72]. Transport of misfolded, misassembled proteins from the ER to the cytosol and clearance by the ubiquitin proteasome system takes place via the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway [72]. However, some viruses use ERAD pathway for their advantage by co-opting ERAD to disassemble and gain access to the cytosol of the host cell [75]. Upon SV40 infection of CV-1, HeLa and 3T6 cells, induction of ERAD factors in turn induce ER membrane reorganization into distinct subdomains called foci and the accumulation of SV40 in these foci was observed [76]. Later, SV40 particles travel across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol [76].

Altering MPTP leads to passive swelling, outer membrane rupture, osmotic water flux, and release of proapoptotic factors leading to cell death [98]. In general, increased MMP induces apoptosis, while decreased MMP prevents apoptosis [86]. Viruses are proposed to decrease MMP to prevent cell death in order to promote their replication. However, in later stages, they may trigger an increase in MMP to release the progeny virions by apoptosis [86]. The M11L protein of myxoma pox virus prevents the loss of MMP in Cos-7 monkey kidney cells, HeLa cells, THP-1 human monocytes and Jurkat T lymphocytes [99].

Some viruses modulate the normal cells to increase aerobic glycolysis and use glucose biosynthetically, which helps especially enveloped viruses to increase their available pool of fatty acids, lipids and nucleotides during their replication [102], [103] The feline leukemia virus infection on lung fibroblasts (FLF-3) resulted in a 30\u201340% increase in glucose uptake and lactic acid production [104]. An increase in the lactic acid production upon infection of the chick embryo cells with Rous sarcoma virus was reported [105]. HCMV upon infection of HFFs, human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE19), human embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC5) and Vero cells enhances glycolytic flux and directs the supply of carbon from glucose to TCA cycle. This helps to facilitate fatty acid biosynthesis while HSV-1 upon infection of same cell lines directs the central carbon metabolism in order to induce the production of pyrimidine nucleotide components [106]. HCV core protein suppresses mitochondrial complex 1 activity and impaired function of electron transport cycle leading to ROS accumulation in hepatoma cells of transgenic mice [107].",

Presence of a peroxisome targeting signal (PTS) in the protein sequence is reported to be essential for targeting proteins into the peroxisomes [109]. However, it was also proposed that viral proteins without PTS may get associated with host peroxisomal proteins in the cytosol which then ferry the viral protein into the peroxisomes in a piggyback fashion [108]. For instance, HCMV encodes a protein called vMIA reported to be localized to peroxisomes in HFFs and HepG2 cells [110]. The vMIA interaction with the host Pex19 protein aids the viral protein localization to the peroxisomes. Fragmentation of peroxisomes upon vMIA expression in HepG2 was also reported [110]. In addition, peroxisomal localization of two cymbidium ring spot viral proteins p33 and p92 was reported in yeast [111]. A role for peroxisomes in the replication of TBSV has also been reported. The viral replication protein p33 interacts with the host peroxisomal protein Pex19 for its targeting to the peroxisomal membrane and subsequent replication [112], [113]. The host hsp70 protein was reported to promote the localization of the viral replication proteins to the peroxisomes in yeast cells [114]. N-terminal protease Npro of pestivirus is another example of a viral protein that is associated with peroxisomes and facilitates its survival and replication [115].",

For example, the infection of cymbidium ring spot virus resulted in the formation of small vesicles at the periphery of the peroxisomes in plant leaf tissues [116]. At the later stage of infection, the entire peroxisomal matrix is occupied by these vesicles [116]. Similarly, the cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) induces the formation of peroxisomal vesicles in which the viral RNA replication occurs in yeast cells [117]. Studies revealed upregulation of peroxisomal biogenesis in endothelial cells upon latent infection of Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus [118]. It was also reported that proteins involved in peroxisomal lipid metabolism were essential for the survival of latently infected human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells [118]. Interestingly, HIV infection reduces the number of peroxisomes in infected cells due to upregulation in the levels of microRNAs that inhibit production of peroxisome biogenesis factors [119].",

Similar phenomenon was also reported upon expression of 3C protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus in Vero cells [128]. Infection of HRV1A on WI-38, 293T, and H1-HeLa cells was reported to induce fragmentation of golgi body, rearrangement of the golgi membranes into vesicles which are utilized as sites of RNA replication [129]. Another incidence of the virus induced golgi body fragmentation was observed upon infection of SARS-CoV that resulted in death of Vero cells [130].",

Another study reported that HCV core 3A protein is involved in downregulating the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) which in turn induces the accumulation of enlarged lipid droplets in human Huh7 and HepG2 cells [144]. In another example, DENV C protein was reported to bind and interact with perilipin 3 a protein present on the surface of the lipid droplets in HepG2 cell lines [145]. A similar localization of DENV C protein was also observed upon infection of DENV2 in BHK-21, HepG2, and C6/36 HT mosquito cells of A. albopictus\n[146].

The X protein of the HBV leads to inhibition of lysosomal acidification leading to loss of functioning [156]. However, the lysosome's ability to fuse with autophagosomes was found to remain unaffected. This virus induced accumulation of immature lysosomes resulting in the suppression of autophagic degradation was followed by development of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma [156]. Deglycosylation of the lysosome-associated membrane proteins by neuraminidase (NA) of H5N1 influenza virus resulted in destruction of lysosomes. This was followed by cell death due to the release of hydrolytic lysosomal enzymes to the cytoplasm [157]. Shubin and colleagues studied the expression of 3C protease of HAV in A549 and human lung epidermoid carcinoma (Calu-1) cell lines and found that HAV 3C protease induces the development of non-acidic cytoplasmic vacuoles which originate from several types of lysosomal/endosomal organelles [158]. Similarly several viruses like HIV, adenovirus, PV have been reported to cause lysosomal rupture [159].",

Similarly selective degradation of NS3 (non-structural protein) of the Zika virus via proteasome mediated pathway was recently reported [183].

            "text": "This review summarizes the modifications that organelles encounter upon viral infection in a cell. Understanding organelle dynamics under various conditions is a fundamental question that has attracted researchers for a long time. The importance of organelle dynamics and function is highlighted by many examples of diseases/disorders where it is affected. Alterations in organelles such as shape, content, dynamics and eventually the function as a result of viral infections is observed. Not only viruses but pathogenic bacteria have also been reported to alter organelles for their survival and infection. As emphasized in this paper, recent studies have shown that many viruses encode proteins that are targeted to various cellular organelles and control their functions. Certainly there exists a close relationship between organelle dynamics and viral infections but thorough characterization will highlight their relevance to pathogenesis. Advanced methods in microscopy and proteomics have enabled such characterization and the molecular details of virus-host interactions and viral replication in host cells is now understood in detail for few viruses. It is important to determine how various organelle proteins are temporally and spatially regulated upon viral infections leading to altered functions. Organelles not as independent entities but a role for inter-organelle communication/inter-organelle cross talk in a cell for optimum functioning is now unequivocally accepted. This is another very interesting aspect to be explored to enhance our understanding of the virus-host interaction mechanisms to enable design of new antiviral strategies. Our understanding on the organelle-virus interaction has been rapidly increasing with the advent of new molecular biology tools and advance imaging techniques. Although we know the basic modus operandi of the viruses, there might be a novel virus that behaves different than the existing dogma with respect to host cellular architecture.",

The figure represents an overview of various cell organelles and the alterations in them as a result of viral infection or viral protein expression as described in the manuscript. Disruption of the nuclear membrane and fragmentation of the nucleus are the two most common morphological alterations of the nucleus observed. Many viruses are also involved in relocalization or depletion of host nucleolar proteins like nucleolin, B23 etc and alterations in the sub-nucleolar PML-NB is also reported. Another major alteration caused due to viral infections is disruption of the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking in the host cell. Several morphological alterations such as formation of single membrane tubules and double membrane vesicles (DMVs), vesicle formation, zippered appearance, etc of the ER are reported upon viral infection. Viruses also interfere with the host post translational machinery resulting in ER stress like UPR and ERAD. Peroxisomes are another set of organelles which have been reported to be a favourable site for the virus in a host cell: Modifications like vesicular structures called \u201cprofoundly modified peroxisomes\u201d or \u201cperoxisome derived multivesicular bodies\u201d are reported in some cell types. Other morphological alterations include fragmentation, degradation and increase in the number of peroxisomes. Reduced levels of peroxisomal membrane protein Pex19 and matrix protein catalase have also been reported in such cells. Various morphological alterations of golgi bodies like disruption and fragmentation, deformation of the membranes into pseudo-circular and pleomorphic structures, amalgamation of golgi apparatus and ER, vesicle formation, etc have been reported as a result of viral infections. Several viral proteins also localize to the golgi body and mature by undergoing post translational modifications. Swelling up and induction of lysosomal rupture is a common alteration caused due to viral protein expression in cells. Formation of a large intracellular vacuole, tubulation of vacuolar membrane and vacuolar acidification as a result of virus infections are reported. Reduced number of lipid droplets and enhanced size of the organelles was reported. Another important alteration in lipid droplets is the decreased level of triglycerides. Viral infection induces morphological alterations of mitochondria like enhanced fission, fusion and mitophagy. Loss of calcium homeostasis in a cell, ROS imbalance, effect on MMP and degradation of mitochondrial DNA are other alterations leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.",
