This virus is cytopathogenic and directly damages the respiratory epithelium in vivo, but also induces host responses that contribute to the development of disease [4], [5]. Synergistically acting co- or super-infections with other respiratory pathogens are common [6], [7], [8]; however, the clinical signs may be severe by infection with BRSV alone [9]. The disease pattern of BRSV in a cattle population varies according to the level of virus circulation and subsequently the herd immunity; in most European countries, clinical disease is highest in calves and is often seen despite the presence of moderate levels of BRSV-specific maternal antibodies [10]. In contrast, high morbidity is observed in animals of all ages in areas where BRSV circulation is low. In these na\u00efve populations, the contagiousness of the virus becomes visible from its rapid spread between herds [11], [12]. Since it is very difficult to control the transmission of BRSV and as seronegative cattle are always at risk for developing severe disease, whether in an endemic situation or not, there is an obvious need for implementation of efficient vaccines.",

This vaccine-induced pathology is characterized by an influx of eosinophils in the lung, which was also previously observed in children vaccinated against human (H)RSV in the 1960s, with a fatal outcome in two infants [17].

A major problem to achieve this goal is that maternally derived antibodies suppress active responses to immunization, even at moderate antibody levels that are not per se protecting the young individual against RSV disease [10] and during the age when infections are common. Vaccination in cattle should preferably be performed at a young age; before commingling of calves into large units where BRSV often circulates, at a time when maternal antibody levels differ between calves [19]. To be efficient at the level of a population it is critical that a new vaccine is effective in the face of maternal immunity.",

On the other hand, inactivated conventional BRSV vaccines have showed varying efficacy in young calves against BRSV in the field [13], [16]. Furthermore, these vaccines are rarely evaluated in models that fully reproduce clinical signs of BRSV disease in the presence of maternal antibodies, and seldom with molecular diagnostic tools.

The aim of the present study is to characterize in more detail the protective immune responses induced by BRSV-ISCOMs in young animals with maternal antibodies against BRSV, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in animals representing the target population for vaccination. On this occasion, the vaccine and challenge virus were homologous, and the time between vaccination and challenge was kept short to approximate the situation of BRSV infection after commingling of young calves. A group of calves immunized with BRSV proteins without adjuvant, qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to those in ISCOMs, was included to further elucidate the adjuvant effect of ISCOM in bovidae.",

Pulmonary function data using the forced oscillation technique showed no changes indicative respiratory function impairment in the BRSV-ISCOM calves.

The IFN\u03b3 mRNA levels were on average 46 times higher than those for IL-4 among animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, which however did not significantly differ from the ratio among controls (average 22, 14 and 18 for BRSV-protein, adjuvant and PBS). Similar patterns were observed in PBMC collected after boost but before challenge. Additionally, within the BRSV-ISCOM group, the individual levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 mRNA correlated perfectly to the degree of virological protection, when not standardized against 28S (data not shown).",

We thus extend the previous finding in 7\u201315-week-old calves [27], to 3\u20138-week old calves, representing a more relevant target population for BRSV vaccination. Supporting earlier data, BRSV-ISCOMs provided clinical protection and a highly significant reduction in virus excretion from the upper respiratory tract of calves, associated with rapid systemic and nasal antibody responses. Additionally, virological protection of the lower respiratory tract was associated with local and systemic humoral responses as well as T cell responses dominated by IFN\u03b3 production. Moreover, we study the safety of this experimental vaccine through clinical and pathological investigations. The absence of clinical signs and the character of pulmonary cellular responses upon succeeding virulent BRSV infection, without excess of neutrophils or eosinophils, indicated good safety of the BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, although this should be further confirmed. By including a group of animals immunized with BRSV proteins alone, we showed that the protective immunological response to these proteins was dependent on ISCOM borne antigen presentation.",

As previously reported after natural and experimental BRSV infection [3], [9], [39], the clinical signs of disease varied within the control groups. Standard deviations were used to illustrate this variation, instead of standard error of the mean that is often misused for this purpose [40]. The variations in clinical signs and pathology might have been due to the short time between challenge and euthanasia and being the result of the variation in the time needed to develop disease, but were most probably influenced by other factors. The three control calves with most severe tachypnea and gross pathology, also had the highest levels of BRSV-specific maternal IgG at challenge and the highest viral loads in nasal secretions, within their groups, and were among the oldest and youngest. This supports the suggestion that maternal antibodies are not fully protective and that T-cell and/or mucosal antibody responses play an important role in protection. Hypothetically, the severe disease in these three control calves could be linked to individual genetic variation in the response to BRSV infection, as has been suggested in the case of HRSV [41] and other animal viral infections [42].",

The ease of virus isolation from controls highlights the virulence of the challenge and it remains to be investigated if the low amounts of virus detected in the BRSV-ISCOM group would transmit to sentinels.

The adverse reactions in the BRSV-ISCOM and adjuvant group upon boosting were of similar extent as can be observed with commercial cattle vaccines. These reactions were probably linked to the Quillaja saponin component that was increased from 5 to 13 times that of the lipids and proteins compared to previously [27]. Besides not causing direct toxicity and acute hypersensitivity reactions, BRSV vaccines must not induce exaggerated inflammatory responses upon natural infection. Indeed, this has been a problem both for vaccines against BRSV in cattle and against the closely related HRSV in man. In the 1960s a formalin inactivated (FI)-HRSV vaccine induced severe pulmonary neutrophilia in children, with the presence of eosinophils in fatal cases [17]. The vaccine induced enhanced disease has been reproduced experimentally in mice and cattle, with reduced IFN\u03b3 production and even more prominent pulmonary eosinophilia [44]. In small animal models FI-HRSV induces Th2-skewed immune responses that may be responsible for bronchoconstriction and inflammation following RSV infection (reviewed by Castilow and Varga and Meyer et al. [45], [46]).",

Notably, even if a BRSV specific T-cell memory can be induced in the presence of maternal antibodies in calves [49], the antibody responses, induced by commercial vaccines in previous studies, were commonly absent [26] and the induced clinical protection was poor in a model reproducing the clinical signs of disease observed in the field [27].",

Similarly, long lasting pulmonary IgA was induced after intranasal BRSV-ISCOM immunization of mice [54]. In contrast, low levels of pulmonary IgG were detected in BAL, probably due to high dilution of samples, which further suggests that the IgA was actively transported into the lung and present in very high amounts. The two calves in the ISCOM group that shed detectable amounts of virus had the lowest levels of pulmonary BRSV-specific IgA within their group.",

Thus, in contrast to calves immunized with BRSV protein alone, the animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs rapidly acquired serum IgG2, an immunoglobulin associated with Th1 cytokines. Furthermore, a similar pattern was seen for the induction of IgG2a in mice (data not shown). Since the IgG1 and IgG2 assays were normalized against different positive control sera, it is not possible to compare the concentrations of these parameters. However, bearing in mind that at four months of age, calves have normally similar levels of total IgG1 as adult cattle, whereas total IgG2 then is only half of adult levels [56], and that IgG2 is complement activating [57], [58]; the presence of this antibody isotype might be linked to protection or associated with a strong T-cell response.",

After stimulation, PBMCs from BRSV-ISCOM immunized animals showed significantly higher levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 mRNA per cell than those from controls, with about 10\u2013160 times higher levels of IFN\u03b3 than IL-4 mRNA. Additionally, significantly higher lymphocyte proliferative responses were induced in animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, indicating that their lymphocytes would both undergo efficient clonal expansion and produce more cytokines per cell, upon BRSV infection. This remains to be verified in vivo. Bovine IL-4 is generally associated with enhanced B-cell survival and IgG1 antibody production in cattle, whereas IFN\u03b3 is normally linked to a Th1 type of response with production of IgG2 and activation of macrophages as well as cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL, reviewed by Estes and Brown [57]). ISCOMs have previously shown an exceptional capacity to induce CTL responses, possibly by enabling B-cell cross-presentation of killed antigens to na\u00efve CD8+ lymphocytes [58], and this will be investigated for BRSV in the future. Supposedly, the marked IFN\u03b3 and the moderate IL-4 mRNA inductions were promoted by ISCOM induction of type I interferons, which in bovine in vitro systems has been shown to induce not only IgG2, but also IgA production [59]. IFN\u03b3 additionally upregulates the production of IgA secretory component and IgA transcytosis by human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro\n[60].",
