            "text": "The family Filoviridae comprises three genera, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus and Cuevavirus. To date, there are five species of ebolaviruses according to the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), Zaire ebolavirus (only member: Ebola virus [EBOV]) Sudan ebolavirus (only member: Sudan virus [SUDV]), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (only member: Bundibugyo virus [BDBV]), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (only member: Ta\u00ef Forest virus [TAFV]), Reston ebolavirus (only member: Reston virus, [RESTV]), one species of marburgvirus, Marburg marburgvirus (two members: Marburg virus [MARV] and Ravn virus [RAVV]) and one species of cuevavirus, Lloviu cuevavirus (only member: Lloviu virus [LLOV]) (Kuhn, 2017). There is compelling evidence that all members of the three genera circulate in bats, which are believed to serve as their natural reservoir, and that zoonotic transmissions of most of these viruses to humans can induce severe disease (Mandl et al., 2018; Olival and Hayman, 2014). Multiple filovirus outbreaks in Africa were recorded during the last 52 years and usually entailed less than 500 cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). In contrast, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in 2013 resulted in an EVD epidemic with more than 10.000 deaths and secondary transmission events in Europe and the US (Lo et al., 2017). Further, a recent outbreak of EVD has started in the Democratic Republic of Congo, causing 543 confirmed cases and 309 deaths (WHO, 2018), and is still ongoing (as of January 2019). These examples show that filovirus infection constitutes a serious health threat that is not limited to African countries in which most filoviruses are endemic. Despite promising results of clinical trials, neither vaccines nor antiviral agents approved by regulatory agencies are currently available to combat filovirus infection. Therefore, the development of antiviral strategies remains a research focus and host cell factors required by diverse filoviruses for spread but dispensable for host cell survival are potential drug targets.",

            "text": "The filovirus glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral entry into target cells. It is a highly N- and O-glycosylated type I transmembrane protein and it is the sole viral protein incorporated into the viral envelope (Martin et al., 2016). Host cell entry of filoviruses is best studied for EBOV and we will therefore focus the subsequent discussion on factors important for EBOV GP-driven entry. To initiate infection, EBOV particles first attach to target cells, which can be facilitated by GP interactions with attachment factors like the C-type lectin DC-SIGN (Alvarez et al., 2002; Simmons et al., 2003). In addition or alternatively, attachment can be facilitated in a GP-independent fashion: Phosphatidylserine residues on the viral envelope can be recognized by TIM (T-Cell Immunoglobulin And Mucin Domain-Containing) proteins (Jemielity et al., 2013; Kondratowicz et al., 2011; Moller-Tank et al., 2013) or, via an adaptor, by tyro 3 kinases, including Axl, which are located on the cell surface (Shimojima et al., 2006). After attachment, virions are taken up into cells by macropinocytosis (Quinn et al., 2009; Saeed et al., 2010) and are trafficked into late endosomes, where GP is processed by the host cell cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB, CatL) (Chandran et al., 2005; Kaletsky et al., 2007; Schornberg et al., 2006), which are known to also process several other viral glycoproteins (Pager et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005). Proteolytically processed GP (also termed primed GP) then interacts with the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) (Carette et al., 2011; Cote et al., 2011) and, upon low pH exposure and a poorly defined additional stimulus (Bale et al., 2011; Brecher et al., 2012; Schornberg et al., 2006) mediates the fusion of viral and late endosomal membranes, thereby allowing the release of the viral genetic information in the host cell cytoplasm. Priming of GP by CatB and to a lesser degree CatL is essential for host cell entry and results frequently obtained with surrogate systems indicate that entry driven by the GPs of all filoviruses might depend on CatB/CatL activity (Gnirss et al., 2012; Maruyama et al., 2014; Misasi et al., 2012). However, the relative dependence varies, with RESTV showing generally modest CatB/CatL dependence and MARV exhibiting pronounced CatL (Misasi et al., 2012) but not CatB dependence (Gnirss et al., 2012; Misasi et al., 2012). Moreover, EBOV entry into dendritic cells was reported to be CatB but not CatL dependent (Martinez et al., 2010). Notably, a study by Marzi and colleagues conducted with authentic viruses suggested that EBOV and BDBV entry into cultured cells is CatB dependent while entry of several other ebolaviruses is not (Marzi et al., 2012). Moreover, the study showed that lack of CatB or CatL expression is compatible with full viral spread and pathogenesis in the rodent host (Marzi et al., 2012). The discrepancies between these results and the CatB/CatL dependence reported by several other studies are incompletely understood. However, one can speculate that particle shape - filoviruses are filamentous while bullet-shaped or spherical particles are frequently used to model filovirus entry - and target cell type may play a role.",

            "text": "We first examined whether retroviral (mainly spherical), rhabdoviral (mainly bullet-shaped) and filoviral (mainly filamentous) particles differ in their CatB/CatL-dependence for host cell entry. For this, we used retro- and rhabdoviral vectors previously used to analyze EBOV-GP-mediated host cell entry (Takada et al., 1997; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998) as well as replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding EBOV-GP (Gonzalez-Hernandez et al., 2018). Moreover, we employed two systems that depend exclusively on filovirus proteins. First, we produced EBOV-like particles harboring luciferase by directed expression of all viral proteins from plasmids, including a VP30 version that is fused to firefly luciferase (Dietzel et al., 2017). Second, we employed the EBOV trVLP system in which a EBOV minigenome is packaged into filoviral particles due to expression of the missing open reading frames (EBOV-NP, -VP30, - VP35 and - L) in trans (Schmidt et al., 2018; Watt et al., 2014). While the VP30-Luc system allows measuring a single delivery of VP30-luciferase into cells, the trVLP system allows studying entry and spread of filovirus-like particles. Finally, we employed the endosomal cysteine protease inhibitors E-64d and MDL28170 to block CatB/CatL activity in target cells. These inhibitors were previously shown to interfere with CatB/CatL activity (Brana et al., 1999; Gewies and Grimm, 2003; Hoffmann et al., 2016; Simmons et al., 2005) and were previously used to inhibit EBOV-GP-driven entry (Gnirss et al., 2012; Kaletsky et al., 2007).",

In contrast, entry driven by the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was not affected by E-64d and MDL28170, as expected. Moreover, analysis of entry of EBOV-GP-bearing rhabdoviral particles into six different cell lines of human (accidental host; 293T, Huh-7, A549 and Calu-3), non-human primate (accidental host; Vero E6) and fruit bat (suspected reservoir host; EpoNi/22.1) origin revealed that entry was sensitive to inhibition by E-64d irrespective of the target cell type, although it should be stated that entry into Calu-3 was very close to background (Fig. 2\n). Collectively, our results show that, under the experimental conditions chosen, EBOV-GP-driven entry was CatB/CatL-dependent irrespective of the surrogate system and target cell line. Moreover, our results identify Calu-3 cells as one of the very few cell lines that are largely resistant to GP-mediated entry.",

In order to answer this question, we investigated whether glycoproteins from viruses of diverse viral families also fail to mediate efficient Calu-3 entry or whether this effect is rather specific for EBOV-GP. We found that glycoproteins of arena- (Lassa virus [LASV], lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV] and Machupo virus [MACV]), paramyxo- (Mumps virus [MuV] and Nipah virus [NiV]) and rhabdoviruses (VSV) mediated entry into Calu-3 cells with high efficiency and to roughly the same levels as measured for Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3\nA). EBOV-GP-driven entry into Vero E6 cells was highly efficient and comparable to that measured for the other glycoproteins tested, while entry into Calu-3 cells was severely attenuated (\u223c200-fold compared to Vero E6 cells) (Fig. 3A). In order to investigate whether Calu-3 cells are largely refractory to entry driven by filovirus GPs in general, we performed the same experiment but tested GPs from viruses of all known filovirus species. All GPs tested mediated efficient entry into control Vero E6 cells, with entry driven by LLOV-GP being slightly less efficient than that observed for the other GPs (Fig. 3B). In contrast, Calu-3 cell entry was severely attenuated for all filovirus GPs with MARV-GP-driven entry being most efficient and ranging \u223c10-fold over background (Fig. 3B). Finally, use of the trVLP system showed that Calu-3 cells were non-susceptible to EBOV-GP-mediated transduction even if GP was presented in the context of EBOV-like particles, although entry into Huh-7 cells was robust, and comparable results were obtained for MARV-GP (Fig. 3C). These results reveal that Calu-3 cells are poorly susceptible to entry driven by filoviral glycoproteins but are readily susceptible to entry driven by arena-, paramyxo- and rhabdoviral glycoproteins.",

In contrast, CatB transcript numbers in Calu-3 cells were comparable or only slightly lower than those in 293T and Huh7 cells (\u223c3- and 13-fold), respectively (Fig. 4A).

In parallel, we examined whether directed expression of other cellular factors known to promote EBOV entry could rescue entry efficiency. To address these questions, we transduced Calu-3 cells with vectors encoding CatB, CatL, Axl, DC-SIGN and NPC1, selected transduced cells via antibiotics and then examined protein expression by immunoblot. These analyses revealed robust expression of CatB, CatL, DC-SIGN, NPC1 and Axl, indicating that transduction and selection were successful (Fig. 4B).",

All particles examined were readily able to transduce Vero E6 control cells with high efficiency, whereas entry into Calu-3 cells was poor (Fig. 3, Fig. 4C). In comparison, directed expression of CatL in Calu-3 cells increased transduction driven by MARV-GP more than 50-fold (Fig. 4C). In contrast, a roughly 2\u20136-fold increase was observed for EBOV-GP-, SUDV-GP-, TAFV-GP- and RESTV-GP-driven entry and only a 1.3-fold enhancement was observed for entry driven by BDBV-GP and LLOV-GP. Moreover, directed expression of DC-SIGN in Calu-3 cells augmented entry driven by EBOV-GP, SUDV-GP and MARV-GP by at least 15-fold. For particles bearing RESTV-GP or TAFV-GP a \u223c2\u20134-fold increase of entry efficiency was observed, whereas the increase of entry driven by BDBV-GP and LLOV-GP was less than 2-fold (Fig. 4C). Finally, expression of the other entry factors did not modulate transduction mediated by any of the filovirus GPs and none of the factors had an impact on transduction mediated by VSV-G, as expected (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that filovirus GP-driven entry into Calu-3 cells is limited at the stage of attachment and priming and that the severity of these limitations varies among the GPs of different filovirus species.",

We selected particles bearing MARV-GP for these experiments, since MARV-GP-driven entry into CatL and DC-SIGN expressing cells was markedly more efficient than entry into Calu-3 control cells. Directed CatL expression in Calu-3 cells increased the efficiency of MARV-GP-driven entry as expected and pre-treatment with MDL28170 abolished this effect (Fig. 4D). Similarly, directed expression of DC-SIGN augmented entry, confirming our results discussed above, and augmentation was partially abrogated by pretreatment of target cells with a monoclonal antibody directed against the ectodomain of DC-SIGN (Fig. 4E). In contrast, entry of control particles bearing VSV-G was not sensitive to DC-SIGN antibody or MDL28170.

Our study shows that EBOV-GP-driven entry into different cell lines depends on CatB/CatL activity and indicates that entry is CatB/CatL dependent irrespective of the surrogate system used to analyze GP. Moreover, we identify Calu-3 cells as largely resistant to entry driven by EBOV-GP and other filovirus GPs and found that entry can be restored by promoting attachment and/or CatL-dependent GP priming.",

Moreover, subsequent analyses performed with surrogate models and/or authentic filoviruses confirmed CatB/CatL dependence of EBOV-GP-driven entry but also provided evidence that CatB/CatL dependence of entry driven by other filoviral GPs was variable (Chandran et al., 2005; Gnirss et al., 2012; Martinez et al., 2010; Misasi et al., 2012; Sanchez, 2007). For instance, directed expression of CatB in CatB/CatL double knockout cells increased EBOV-GP- and TAFV-GP-driven entry while directed expression of CatL had only a moderate effect. Moreover, expression of both proteases only moderately increased SUDV-GP-driven entry. In contrast, directed expression of either CatB or CatL markedly increased RESTV-GP-driven entry and expression of CatL but not CatB efficiently promoted MARV-GP-driven entry (Misasi et al., 2012). The general requirement for CatB and/or CatL activity for entry driven by most ebola- and marburgvirus glycoproteins demonstrated by these studies was contrasted by a report by Marzi and colleagues, who showed that Vero cell infection by EBOV and to some degree BDBV depends on CatB but not CatL activity while entry of TAFV, SUDV and RESTV is independent of CatB/CatL activities (Marzi et al., 2012). Finally, this study demonstrated that knockout of CatB or CatL does not interfere with EBOV spread and pathogenesis in mice (Marzi et al., 2012). The reason for the discrepancy between these results is largely unclear and differences in the particles used to study GP-driven entry and in the target cells might be accountable.",

Thus, 293T cell entry of retroviral particles, rhabdoviral particles and filoviral particles was inhibited by E-64d and MDL28170 in a dose-dependent fashion. In this context, it should be stated that particles produced using the trVLP system should adequately mimic virions produced in EBOV infected cells, since particle production in the trVLP system exclusively depends on viral proteins and all proteins encoded by EBOV are expressed in the particle producing cells (Watt et al., 2014), which can release filamentous particles (Wang et al., 2018). These results suggest that particle shape might not be a major determinant of CatB/CatL dependence of EBOV-GP-driven entry. However, particle production in the surrogate systems studied is likely not uniform and it can at present not be excluded that for instance a fraction of particles produced in the trVLP system is spherical or bullet shaped and that only the cell entry of these particles is CatB/CatL-dependent.",

Similarly, CatB/CatL dependence was not impacted by the donor species, since EBOV-GP-driven entry into human, non-human primate and fruit bat cell lines was CatB/CatL-dependent, confirming a previous study (Hoffmann et al., 2016). However, these experiments revealed that Calu-3 cell entry driven by EBOV-GP and all other filovirus GPs studied was inefficient. This finding was remarkable for two reasons: First, EBOV exhibits a broad cell tropism and EBOV-GP is known to mediate entry into a diverse panel of cell lines, with only lymphoid cells being refractory for incompletely understood reasons (Dube et al., 2010; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998; Yang et al., 1998). Second, Calu-3 cells have previously been shown to express very low levels of endogenous CatL, which were incompatible with CatL-dependent entry of MERS-CoV into these cells (Park et al., 2016). This finding raised the question whether the low endogenous CatL expression might also limit EBOV-GP-driven entry into these cells.",

            "text": "We confirmed low CatL expression in Calu-3 cells and equipped these cells with an expression cassette for CatL in order to unravel whether CatL expression limits EBOV-GP dependent entry. In parallel, we examined whether directed expression of the filovirus entry factors NPC1, Axl and DC-SIGN increased entry efficiency, which would suggest that attachment (DC-SIGN, Axl) or receptor engagement (NPC1) limits entry into Calu-3 cells. Finally, cells were equipped with CatB as control. We found that both directed expression of DC-SIGN and CatL can promote Calu-3 cell entry driven by filoviral GPs. However, the entry promoting effect of these factors was dependent on the viral GP studied. Expression of DC-SIGN, a calcium-dependent lectin that binds to glycans on GP and promotes viral attachment to cells (Alvarez et al., 2002; Simmons et al., 2003), markedly increased entry driven by EBOV-GP, SUDV-GP and MARV-GP. Moreover, DC-SIGN expression moderately augmented entry driven by RESTV-GP and TAFV-GP, suggesting that viral attachment limits Calu-3 cell entry driven by most if not all GPs tested. In comparison, directed expression of CatL markedly increased MARV-GP- and moderately augmented EBOV-GP-, SUDV-GP-, TAFV-GP- and RESTV-GP-driven entry. These findings are largely in keeping with a previous report suggesting a pronounced contribution of CatL to RESTV- and MARV-GP-driven entry (Misasi et al., 2012) and demonstrate that priming can also limit GP-driven entry into Calu-3 cells. Notably, entry driven by LLOV- and BDBV-GP was not appreciably rescued upon CatL or DC-SIGN expression, although previous studies showed that entry driven by these GPs depends on CatL activity (LLOV) and is augmented by DC-SIGN expression (LLOV, BDBV) (Maruyama et al., 2014; Marzi et al., 2006). The reasons for this effect are at present unknown. However, one can speculate that both attachment and priming limit LLOV and BDBV entry into Calu-3 cells, suggesting that coexpression of DC-SIGN and CatL might render the cells susceptible, a possibility that remains to be examined. Finally, it is noteworthy that entry driven by MARV-GP was efficiently and comparably augmented upon directed expression of DC-SIGN or CatL. One explanation could be that attachment and priming are operative at low levels in these cells, in keeping with the low but detectable MARV-GP-driven entry into untreated Calu-3 cells, and that boosting either one of the two processes is sufficient to allow for robust MARV-GP-driven entry. In this context, it is noteworthy that a functional link between lectin-mediated augmentation of viral entry and CatB/L mediated GP priming has previously been suggested (Matsuno et al., 2010). One could thus speculate that binding of MARV-GP to DC-SIGN might reduce CatL-dependence of viral entry, potentially by routing particles into a particular uptake pathway or by stabilizing a GP conformation in which the CatL cleavage site is more exposed.",
