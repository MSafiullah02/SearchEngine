To reduce these risks, most institutions implement strict policies that require testing of biologics for the presence of adventitious infectious agents before their use within the barrier. These tests are typically available through commercial services that use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect the presence of nucleic acid sequences of viruses or mycoplasma (Bauer et al. 2004). Unnecessary testing of samples can waste time and resources, but lack of adherence to strict barrier practices (including the prudent testing of biologics) can leave institutions vulnerable to costly expenditures for remediation of contamination. Thus it is important for investigators and those that manage laboratory animal resources to understand and assess the risks associated with the use of cell lines and biologics.",

The effects of numerous rodent pathogens on biologic systems and on research are described in other articles in this issue (Besselsen et al. 2008; Mahabir et al. 2008; Watson 2008) and elsewhere (Lindsey et al. 1991). Institutions go to great lengths to prevent rodents that may be infected with rodent pathogens from entering their animal facilities, so it is certainly appropriate to accord equal diligence to items that enter the barrier in vials and test tubes. Similar to the importation of live rodents, cell lines and biologics derived from colonies that are stringently monitored for adventitious infectious agents are at lower risk of contamination than those from colonies of unknown status.",

However, unless a detailed and complete history of the cell line is available from the progenitor and subsequent handlers, there may have been opportunities for exposure that would put the cell line at risk for contamination. Potential points for rodent pathogen exposure can come early in a cell line\u2019s development. For example, primary mouse fibroblast cells and some specifically selected cell lines produce undefined factors that are conducive to cell growth and are often necessary to maintain the viability of primary cultures (Lazaro et al. 1998; Orlik and Altaner 1988). Once the primary cells become established, these \u201cfeeder cells\u201d are no longer needed and their previous presence in the culture can be easily forgotten. In some cases conditioned media, in which the feeder cells have been cultured, can substitute for the cells themselves and this substrate may also carry contaminants (Bazin and Lemieux 1989).",

Stem cells are being increasingly studied for potential application as therapeutics in almost every field of biomedical research (Taupin 2007). Risks may increase with stem cells that are derived from rodents and/or that require the presence of rodent-derived feeder cells (stromal cells/fibroblasts) for culture maintenance (Hirashima et al. 1999). Investigations are also under way to define the growth factors and cytokines that control stem cell growth and differentiation in vitro (Kouro et al. 2007). The rederivation of these rodent-derived reagents offers an additional avenue for the introduction of infectious contaminants. As Nicklas and Weiss report (2000), embryonic stem cells from institutes with high health monitoring standards have a lower risk of contamination; the authors were unable to detect viral contaminants in the 46 stem cell lines they analyzed. However, it is important to remain vigilant, as Kyuwa (1997) and Okumura and colleagues (1996) demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus replication can persist in embryonic stem cells.",

The cell lines are the product of the fusion of splenocytes, typically from antigen-stimulated rodents, and myeloma cell lines, also typically derived from mice; infection in either of these cell lines is likely to cause contamination of the resulting hybridoma cell line. The third source of contamination of hybridomas is feeder cells (mouse fibroblasts) or conditioned media added to postfusion cells to increase survival during clonal expansion (Yokoyama et al. 2006). Last, some researchers believe that it is possible to restore high antibody production from failing hybridoma cells by growing them in the peritoneal cavity of mice and returning the cells to culture. This procedure exposes the cells to yet another mouse colony that could be infected and can therefore result in contamination. In addition, MHV and MPV acquired in the mouse can continue to infect and replicate in cells of lymphoid lineage in vitro, making hybridomas more vulnerable to persistent contamination with these organisms (Lamontagne et al. 1989; Previsani et al. 1997).",

If these cell lines are derived from nonrodent sources and maintained in standard culture media there is minimal risk of rodent viral contamination. In some cases, cells from a tumor may not adapt well to the in vitro environment and so are implanted from the human (or other species) directly into immunocompromised mice (Morton and Houghton 2007). Cells that are supported by the mouse\u2019s system will expand and provide a source for repeated trials to optimize conditions for in vitro growth. Cell lines that do not adapt to in vitro conditions may need to be maintained by repeated passage in the mouse (Sobel and Sadar 2005). This repeated and often prolonged exposure to different mice increases the risk of contamination for these cells. Established tumor cell lines may also be taken out of culture and injected in rodents in order to develop metastatic variants; the cells are injected intravenously and reisolated from target organs of interest (lung, brain, liver, bone marrow) (Kitamura et al. 2000; Victor et al. 1999). Multiple cycles of reisolation/injection may be necessary to develop the desired characteristics. The cells are then typically returned to culture and maintained in vitro until they are needed for an in vivo experiment.",

The only viral contaminant they found was lactate dehydrogenase\u2013 elevating virus (LDHV), and it was present only in cell lines that had been propagated in mice (9 of 14); none of the other 82 cell lines maintained in vitro had evidence of viral contamination. In a similar, earlier survey at a German institute, Nicklas and colleagues (1993) reported contamination of 25% of cell lines tested, with LDHV present in 17.8% of the lines tested. As suggested by these studies and a review by Blank and colleagues (2004), the incidence of infectious rodent agents in cell lines has markedly decreased over the last 35 years. Records from our institution covering the last 3 years support this assumption, as none of the 153 cell lines that we have imported from vendors and other institutions have tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics for any of the rodent viruses on the RADILIMPACT II Profile (RADIL; Columbia, MO) (personal communication with Marie-Louise Miller, MedImmune, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, August 2007).",

Endemic infections with M. pulmonis have been relatively rare in the 21st century, and thus the risks associated with contamination of cell cultures derived from, or exposed to, barrier-maintained rodents in the last decade are much lower than before.",

In order to determine if this was a variable within a strict timeline, use of these cell lines in our barrier facility was permitted on the condition that they be demonstrably free of M. pulmonis or M. rodenticum. Although there are no reports of rodentto-rodent transmission of the common laboratory Mycoplasma contaminants, because immunocompromised mice were used, we placed them in a quarantine room and implemented special husbandry and technical procedures to reduce the risk of transmission.",

Mycoplasma is resilient, and periodic post-treatment testing is necessary to differentiate reduction (beyond detection) in viral load from cure. It is also advisable to consider the possibility of phenotypic alterations of the cell line after exposure to antibiotics. Alternatively, an old established method for curing a cell line of Mycoplasma contamination is to introduce the cells into a rodent, allow its immune system to clear the organism, and reharvest the cells for continued culture (Roseto et al. 1984). This procedure is another example of how cell lines can be exposed to rodent viruses as described in the preceding section.",

Although there are many shortcomings to interpreting data gathered this way, the exercise suggests that a significant number of institutions may not monitor for these potential sources of rodent virus contamination.

Early in 2007, our institution received reports from a contract laboratory that some of our tumor studies would be delayed because lactate dehydrogenase\u2013elevating virus (LDHV) contamination was discovered in three lots of BMM. Surveys of other institutions revealed that five lots of BMM showed evidence of LDHV contamination. Although the supplier reported using a contract laboratory that implemented a sentinel health monitoring program, LDHV remained undetected in the colony that housed the mice from which the BMM-producing cells were harvested. The fact that LDHV does not readily spread to sentinels (Lindsey et al. 1991) likely explains, in part, why this organism escaped detection and why it is therefore commonly found in cells and biologics. This incident clearly revealed that although the use of sentinels in health monitoring programs may reduce the risks of viral contamination to animals and biologics, agents such as LDHV require monitoring directly in the sample (mouse or biologic) itself. This organism may adversely affect research involving infected mice; fortunately, because its transmission generally requires direct contact, LDHV contamination in a colony does not require extensive decontamination measures as compared to contamination with mouse hepatitis virus or mouse parvovirus.",

Bacteria and viruses may be passed through rodents in order to increase their virulence and then returned to culture for maintenance (Al-Hello et al. 2005; Mase et al. 2006; Peters and Paterson 2003).

Pooling of serum from mice is a typical means of obtaining the quantities and uniformity needed for experimental purposes. Because this practice potentially widens the distribution of infectious agents, there are increased risks associated with pooled serum samples. Most serum transfer protocols are likely to involve mice in the same facility, and in these instances the risk of introducing new contaminants is negligible. However, there are some current models, such as the K/BxN serum transfer model of rheumatoid arthritis, in which serum production can be contracted off-site, stored, and imported (Kouskoff et al. 1996). In this situation, and others that involve off-site production of biologics for in vivo use, the health status of rodents at the sponsor site may be at risk of exposure to infectious agents from the contracted site. Careful review of the procedures and health surveillance of the contracted institution can help to reduce these risks.",

Antibodies are the most common rodent-derived protein used in biomedical research. When bound to their targets, many of them disrupt specific protein interactions and cellular functions involved in infection, inflammation, or cancer cell growth. Antibodies that show potential as research tools and/or therapeutics are often tested further in mouse models (Harris and Adair 1997). A survey by Nicklas and colleagues (1993) reported LDHV contamination in two monoclonal antibodies (crude ascites), one of which unexpectedly caused an increase in serum interferon levels during an experimental study (Nicklas et al. 1988). Purification procedures are likely to reduce viral load in monoclonal antibody preparations, although studies supporting this hypothesis are lacking. Monoclonal antibodies that are (1) produced strictly by in vitro methods from a hybridoma cell line proven to be negative for rodent viruses and (2) purified over a dedicated column should not require further testing for these agents (although periodic mycoplasma testing of the culture is advisable).",
