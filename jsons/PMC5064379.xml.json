While avian H7N9 viruses invariably have PB2-627E, A/Shanghai/2/2013 (Sh2) (H7N9) virus which was isolated from a patient with severe disease had acquired the mammalian adaptation mutation PB2-E627K, and this is reflected in recombinant rgH7N9 virus used in this study. Tissue tropism and virus replication competence of rgH7N9 virus and its PB2 mutants were compared. Recombinant H7N9 virus with PB2-627K replicated to similar titers with H1N1pdm in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung as we previously described9. We demonstrated that H7N9 possessing PB2-627E failed to infect and replicate in the ex vivo cultures of human bronchus, lung, in vitro cultures of human ATI and PM\u03d5 and in ex vivo cultures of swine trachea and bronchus suggesting that the avian virus is not adapted for replication in the human or swine respiratory tract. The compensatory mammalian adaptation mutations in PB2, Q591K or D701N could partially rescued the virus replication in human and swine cells and tissues though it was not reaching the full competence of the rgH7N9 virus with the PB2-627K. This emphasized the key role of PB2-E627K in contributing to the efficient viral replication of H7N9 in the human respiratory tract. These findings are in agreement with others who have found that lysine in position 627 in PB2 was found to be essential for mammalian adaptation in terms of the enhancement of polymerase activity, viral growth kinetics and virulence in mice when compared with the mutants of Sh2 or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) having PB2-627E1314.",

The profiles of sialic acid distribution in human and swine respiratory tract might play a crucial role as well though the distribution pattern of sialic acid receptors in swine and human respiratory tracts are similar272930, but higher Gal\u03b11-3Gal expression and comparatively rare extended sialylated LacNAc repeats can be observed in swine31.",

Here, we isolated the ex vivo cultures of swine trachea, bronchus and lung from intact respiratory organs of 6-month old pigs (Sus scrofa domestica). These pigs were farm-raised, exposed to field conditions and represent the natural population of animals31. Jones et al., in contrast, used the explant cultures of tracheal and lung explants of one-week-old laboratory piglets to examine the infectivity of H7N9 in swine. They found that three human H7N9 viruses including A/Anhui/1/2013, A/Shanghai/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/2013 replicated efficiently in trachea and lung20. In our case, although no replication and positive staining were found in the swine trachea after virus inoculation, the influenza nucleoprotein antigen positive cells were also found in terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells in the lung. The lectin binding and glycan array profiles of the respiratory tracts of adult domestic pigs are different from infant pigs, the binding of Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA, a lectin binds \u03b1-2,6 glycans) was strong for the upper respiratory tract of both infant and adult pigs but binding to Maackia amurensis agglutinin-I (MAA-I, a lectin binds \u03b1-2,3 N-glycans) and MAA-II (a lectin binds \u03b1-2,3 O-glycans) was only observed infant pigs. There was a strong binding of SNA lectin to the alveoli of infant pigs but weak to that of adult pigs2731. Therefore, it is possible that age of pigs may affect the permissiveness for H7N9 virus replication. This can lead to variations in the determination of virus tropism, infection and transmission.",

Liu et al. infected young domestic pigs in vivo with A/Anhui/1/2013 recombinant viruses32. They found that the wild type and 627E viruses replicated well in the lung and trachea and was found transmissible between direct contact animals32. Our observations suggest that H7N9 with either PB2-627K or E is able to infect and replicate the ex vivo cultures of swine lung and thus providing a virus reservoir for possible transmissions, however, the lack of efficient replication of H7N9 in swine conducting airways, the trachea and bronchus, would imply that transmission could be inefficient. The tropism observations presented in this paper partly addressed the reason why there is not yet a report on the isolation of H7N9 from pigs in the field333435.",

A recent report suggested that an avian H7N9 virus isolated from pooled oropharyngeal swabs of Silkie chickens (A/SCk/HK/1772/2014) with PB2-627E transmitted efficiently among chickens via direct contact. The transmission efficiency of this isolate was comparable to that found in a human H7N9 isolate with PB2-627V/E/K polymorphism (A/HK/3263/2014)36. When a chicken-to-ferret transmission experiment was performed using this Silkie chicken strain, a rapid increase in the proportion of 627K over 627E was observed in the nasal washes of transmitted ferrets. The E627K adaption in PB2 gene was therefore shown to be associated with mammalian adaptation in ferrets53738. Besides, we showed that in contrast to the tropism data found in the tissue and cells of human and swine, rgPB2-K627E could still replicate in the chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells at 37 \u00b0C, albeit less efficiently than rgH7N9 or the mutants rgPB2-K627E + Q591K or rgPB2-K627E + D701N.

Influenza viruses are detected through the recognition of toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expressed in the endosome and on the surface of human respiratory epithelial cells424344 and in the phagosome of macrophages454647. Thus abortive infection may be sufficient to trigger cytokine responses. Infected cells are sensed by TLR3 with the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines dependent on the expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), type I interferon and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)454849. Macrophages are active innate immune cells able to patrol around to detect potential pathogens by amoeboid movement. One of the characteristic differences between macrophages and lung epithelial cells is the function of phagocytosis for the removal of infected or dying cells5051. Although rgPB2-K627E was not replicating in PM\u03d5, it might be possible that PM\u03d5 phagocytoses the influenza virus-infected and apoptotic cells therefore activates the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines since PM\u03d5 is capable of secreting cytokines once they exposed to any inflammatory stimuli505253.",

Thus, PB2-E627K, or the compensatory adaptations such as PB2-Q591K or D701N would be essential to at least partly rescue the replication competence of virus possessing PB2-627E in the mammalian system. The current ex vivo cultures of human and swine lung, and in vitro culture of primary human peripheral blood derived macrophages would be a good risk assessing model for the virus competence in replication and host innate immune response induction. Our experimental findings explain why many H7N9 virus isolates from humans have one or other of these mammalian adaptation mutations in PB2.",
