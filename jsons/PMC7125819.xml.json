The combination of MS detectors with LC-separation techniques is probably the most commonly applied methodology for identifying contaminants in food and environmental samples [3].",

Currently, it is common practice to screen first a large number of samples for possible contamination and then subject suspected samples to further confirmation. Traditional analytical methods require dedicated laboratories, equipment and highly-trained personnel for detection and identification of each type of hazardous agent (e.g., antibiotics, bacteria, and allergens). Screening tools today are therefore based on assays incorporating biological recognition elements (biological binding assays), which offer simpler, more rapid analysis. The most commonly used bioanalytical methods for routine monitoring are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in 96-well plate format [2], [4], [5]. Even though some level of automation has been achieved in the recent years, ELISAs remain laborious, time-consuming and expensive, when multiple targets need to be screened for, so there is a growing need for new multi-analyte screening methods, which will enable rapid, simultaneous detection of contaminants in numerous samples.",

Array sensor optics comprise a patterned glass slide, which is placed on a support and is illuminated by launching 635 nm light from a diode laser into one end, a GRIN lens array, which focus the fluorescent patterns, an emission filter, which rejects unwanted laser light and a Peltier-cooled CCD camera which images the array.",

This approach in combination with fluorescent dyes, which are excited at longer wavelengths (e.g., Cy5 and AlexaFluor 647), significantly reduces interference from the bulk fluid, offering better reproducibility and sensitivity when used for analysis in complex sample matrixes. Optical properties of such fluorophores also allow a small, lightweight source of excitation (e.g., diode laser) and a compact optical detection system (e.g., CCD camera). Multi-analyte detection is achieved through the \u201cbar-code\u201d approach. Biotinylated capture antibodies are immobilized on the avidin-coated waveguide surface in columns, using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) block with several channels. The PDMS block is then oriented perpendicularly and several different samples are passed through the channels. The array biosensor is portable and automated, and thus is very well suited to in-field measurements. Also, its detection principles allow analysis of crude matrixes with minimal sample preparation. Commercial versions of the array biosensor have recently become available [6]. The array biosensor has been used for the detection of small molecules, toxins, proteins, bacteria and viruses in numerous applications in food safety, diagnostics, homeland security and environmental monitoring.",

Conventional microscope glass slides, modified with (3-glycidyl-oxypropyl)trimethoxysilane, were used as a solid-phase support for the microarray.

Free antibody binds to hapten spots and then the secondary antibody, labeled with peroxidase (POD), is introduced. Formation of the immuno-complex is detected by light emission in the presence of a luminol-based POD substrate. The direct immunoassay format was also demonstrated in this system. The microarrays are for multiple uses, and are regenerated between sequential measurement cycles. The analyzed samples do not require enrichment and pretreatment steps, and the target analytes can be detected within 5 min (excluding the regeneration cycle) with sensitivities reaching ng/L concentrations of analyte.

SPR biosensors are based on optical phenomenon which occurs when the evanescent wave, generated by light, interacts with free electrons in a thin metal film. The intensity of the reflected light at a specific angle is thus reduced. The light angle at which this reduction occurs is called the SPR angle, and it varies with the refractive index of the dielectric medium (usually buffer) close to the metal film (usually gold). When molecules are immobilized on and/or bound to the gold surface, the SPR angle changes, allowing label-free and real-time monitoring [11].",

The assay is performed in a 96-well microtiter plate format, allowing simultaneous analysis of several samples within 4 h and with little preparation.

Upon binding of the antigen, PDA liposomes undergo a color change to red, visible to the naked eye, and produce fluorescence (Reproduced in modified form with permission from [17]). (B) The simultaneous detection of two species of pathogens in an assay based on gold-nanorod probes. (Left) Two gold nanorods, with different aspect ratios, coated with antibodies form complexes with the target pathogens in one reaction tube. (Right) The change in the UV/Vis absorbance spectra is dose-dependent on the pathogen concentration in the sample, and the two pathogens are distinguished by maximal absorbance peaks at different wavelengths (Reproduced in modified form with permission from [21]).",
