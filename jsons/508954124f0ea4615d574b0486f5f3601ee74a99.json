Single nucleotide polymorphism WUR10000125 (WUR) is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the causative mutation and can ABSTRACT: A QTL for host response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was identified in a previous study. The SNP WUR10000125 (WUR) is used as a tag SNP for this QTL. The favorable (B) allele at this SNP is in low frequency in commercial populations, possibly because this allele is unfavorably associated with an important trait under nonchallenging conditions and, therefore, may have been selected against. Therefore, objectives of this study were to estimate the effect of WUR on traits under selection in commercial lines under nonchallenging conditions and to estimate the effect of WUR genotype of parents on performance of crossbred progeny in a commercial-like environment. Data were collected on 4 purebred lines: a Landrace dam line (D1), a Large White dam line (D2), a synthetic sire line (S1), and a Pietrain sire line (S2). Traits analyzed included total number born, number stillborn, farrowing survival, lactation survival, litter mortality, daily feed intake (DFI), backfat, average test daily gain (TGR), average lifetime daily gain (LGR), and Topigs Norsvin selection index (TSI) value, indicative of overall economic value. Deregressed EBV were calculated for each trait (except TSI) and",

The favorable allele for host response to PRRS was associated with greater DFI and a tendency for greater TGR in the S2 line, but the opposite direction of effect was detected for the S1 line. Regardless of the effect on individual traits, no significant effect of WUR on TSI was detected for any line. Therefore, selecting for the B allele is expected to result in progeny with increased resistance to PRRS without compromising overall economic value under normal, nonchallenging conditions. be used as a tag SNP for this QTL (Boddicker et al., 2014a,b; Koltes et al., 2015) . Guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5), which plays a role in the innate immune response (Shenoy et al., 2012) , was recently identified as the causative gene for this QTL (Koltes et al., 2015) . The effect of WUR has been validated across breeds and genetic sources (Boddicker et al., 2014b) and following infection with 2 North American PRRS virus (PRRSV) isolates (Hess et al., 2016) , vaccination with a PRRS modified live virus (MLV) vaccine (Abella et al., 2016; Dunkelberger et al., 2017) , and coinfection with PRRSV and porcine circovirus type 2b (PCV2b; Dunkelberger et al., 2017) . The frequency of the favorable (B) allele (\"G\" nucleotide) under PRRS challenge is low in commercial populations (i.e., average frequency across 8 PRRS Host Genetics Consortium trials was 0.14, where each trial comprised pigs sourced from different breeding companies; Boddicker et al., 2014b) . One hypothesis for the low frequency of the B allele is that it is unfavorably associated with an important trait under nonchallenging conditions and, therefore, has been selected against in commercial breeding schemes.",

Results showed no significant effect of WUR on any of the reproduction or finishing traits in the dam lines, except FSL, for which a significant interaction of PRRS_Vacc \u00d7 WUR was detected for the D2 line. For this line, no evidence of a difference in FSL was detected between genotypes within the NonVx group, but AB pigs had significantly greater FSL than AA pigs within the Vx group. Pigs in the latter group originated from farms that vaccinate dams with a PRRS MLV vaccine at d 60 of gestation. The PRRS MLV vaccine is a live virus vaccine, meaning that piglets may have been exposed to PRRSV during gestation. Therefore, this result indicates that of piglets potentially positive for PRRSV at farrowing, AB pigs had a significantly higher chance of surviving farrowing than AA pigs, which is consistent with previously reported results of a protective effect of the B allele following PRRS MLV vaccination (Dunkelberger et al., 2017) . Some significant associations of WUR with index traits were detected for analyses of the sire lines, but the magnitude and direction of this effect differed by trait and by line. For DFI, TGR, and LGR, the direction of the WUR effect was consistent within each line, but the opposite direction of effect was detected across lines. For instance, AB pigs had significantly lower DFI and, consequently, lower TGR and LGR than AA pigs for the S1 line, but the opposite direction of effect was detected for the S2 line. For the S2 line, AB pigs had significantly greater DFI and significantly greater TGR than AA pigs. However, regardless of the magnitude or direction of these effects for the S1 and the S2 lines, effect sizes of WUR for DFI, TGR, and LGR (expressed as a proportion of the genetic SD) were small.

This was evaluated for the S1 line using the WUR genotype effects for the S1 line and the phenotypic means for DFI and TGR for the S1 \u00d7 (D1 \u00d7 D2) individuals. The same G:F (i.e., g of weight gain/d during the test period to g of feed consumed/d during the test period) was observed for AA, AB, and BB pigs (0.38:1). The G:F for S1 \u00d7 (D1 \u00d7 D2) progeny was also 0.38:1 for AA, AB, and BB pigs. However, it is important to note that the SE of the WUR effect for BB pigs was large, due to a low number (n = 73) of BB S1 \u00d7 (D1 \u00d7 D2) individuals. Therefore, although differences in the magnitude of the WUR effect were observed for feed intake and growth for the S1 line, these differences are likely not practically relevant and do not appear to negatively impact G:F of AB S1 or crossbred individuals, which might also explain why WUR had no significant effect on TSI for this line.",

For associations that were detected, the magnitude and direction of effect differed by trait and by line. For the significant associations that were detected, the small effect sizes indicate little practical relevance of WUR genotype on the trait of interest. Results from analyses of each line separately and the across-line analyses indicate failure to identify a significant, negative effect of WUR across lines for any one trait. Results for the TSI analyses showed no significant effect of WUR on overall TSI for analysis of each line separately or analysis of TSI across lines. The results of the TSI analyses are particularly important because they indicate that the combined effect of WUR on all traits included in the selection index (whether favorable or unfavorable for individual traits) did not have a significant effect on the overall economic value of individuals within a line. This finding provides additional support for selection for the B allele to breed pigs for improved host response to PRRS.",

            "text": "Based on the finding that no consistent, negative association of WUR with any one trait was detected across lines, it remains unclear why the B allele is in low frequency in commercial populations. The negative association with growth rate for the S1 line may partially explain the low frequency of this allele in that line. However, the opposite direction of effect on growth rate was observed for the S2 line. This could be because the linkage phase between WUR and the causative mutation are opposite in these 2 lines. However, Koltes et al. (2015) showed that the putative causative mutation was perfectly concordant with WUR genotype for pigs with different haplotypes in the WUR region. Analyzing growth rate at different stages of production as separate traits may also provide some clarity regarding the effect of WUR on growth. Second, we cannot rule out that the low frequency of the B allele may be due to a negative association of WUR with a trait that has been under (natural) selection and that was not analyzed in the current study. However, perhaps the most likely reason for the low frequency of the favorable allele at WUR is that there is no selective advantage of the B allele in the absence of disease and, therefore, this allele has not been selected for because most selection is performed in a clean environment.",

These results conflict with findings from a recent study where AB pigs had significantly slower growth than AA pigs during finishing (Abella et al., 2016) . Possibly, this discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that pigs used for the Abella et al. (2016) study were 6 wk older than those used for the study conducted by Dunkelberger et al. (2017) .

The S1 \u00d7 (D1 \u00d7 D2) pigs that were used for this objective were the progeny of S1 sires and D1 \u00d7 D2 F 1 females. Daily feed intake, BFE, TGR, and LGR were analyzed using phenotypic records collected on S1 \u00d7 (D1 \u00d7 D2) progeny in test stations. Results indicate no significant effect of average parent WUR genotype on performance for any of the traits. Therefore, WUR genotype of the parents did not negatively impact DFI, BFE, TGR, or LGR of their commercial crossbred offspring. Further analysis of WUR genotype of the S1 \u00d7 (D1 \u00d7 D2) individuals themselves also showed no significant effect of their own WUR genotype on DFI, BFE, TGR, or LGR (data not shown). Because the farms where the crossbred pigs were raised were designed to mimic commercial conditions, the finding that neither parent average WUR genotype nor WUR genotype of the individual itself had a significant effect on any of the evaluated traits indicates that WUR genotype did not negatively impact performance of commercial crossbred finishing pigs reared in a commercial setting.",

This approach may be used as a simpler and less time-intensive alternative to including WUR genotype in the selection index. Instead, index value calculation and identification of top-ranking sires can be performed normally followed by selection of sires with the BB genotype. It is expected that progeny of BB sires, which will have at least one copy of the B allele, will have increased resistance to PRRS and no significant difference in TSI from progeny of AA or AB sires. Of the lines analyzed in this study, we recommend to begin sorting S1 sires. Although negative associations with WUR were detected for feed intake and growth rate for this line, no significant effect of WUR was detected on TSI, the frequency of the B allele is highest within the S1 line, and pigs from this line are already noted for increased robustness to disease challenge and environmental stressors in the field.",
