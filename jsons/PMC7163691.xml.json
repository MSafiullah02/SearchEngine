            "text": "Many paradigms have been used to describe and comprehend the complexity associated with ecological communities. From Darwin's tangled bank to a Jenga tower (de Ruiter et al. 2005), all these ideas reinforce the notion that ecological communities are not random assemblages of species that just happen to occur together in space. Rather there is structure within ecological networks of interacting species, and understanding these structural properties is crucial for predicting how communities will respond to disturbance (McCann 2007). One avenue of research has focused on the identification of compartments within networks, here called modules (Guimera et al. 2007). Species within modules interact more closely with other species within the module than between modules of the network and so concentrate energy or the flow of organic material in modules (Krause et al. 2003). The presence of modules is thought to increase the stability of networks as they slow the spread of disturbances throughout the network (May 1972, Krause et al. 2003). For example, Krause et al. (2003) simulated the removal of a fish species due to overfishing and the addition of an invasive zooplankton species in the Chesapeake Bay food web and found in both cases that the impact of this disturbance event was retained in the directly affected module, minimizing impact on other modules of the network. Kondoh (2008) suggests that food webs can be thought of as networks of interacting modules whose arrangement is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. Moreover, subunits within pollination networks have been suggested as a focus for conservation efforts (Corbet 2000, Dicks et al. 2002). However, modules have proved difficult to identify and examine due to a deficiency of resolution and lack of network replication (Raffaelli and Hall 1992). These limitations led early researchers to suggest that modules in networks were not a common phenomenon (Pimm and Lawton 1980), although it was noted that multispecies communities are theoretically more stable if arranged into \u201cblocks\u201d (May 1972).",

            "text": "In many parts of the world, the farming landscape represents a relatively homogeneous patchwork of crops and pasture fields interspersed with small amounts of remnant vegetation in the form of linear strips (e.g., hedgerows) or isolated patches (e.g., woodlands). For some species the whole\u2010farm network may be acting as a small\u2010scale meta\u2010community, with particular habitat types forming different modules linked by dispersal (Leibold et al. 2004), such that dispersal within these habitats is more likely than dispersal between habitats. Structural modules could form in farm food webs as a result of there being more interactions between species within habitats than among habitats. Thus, the heterogeneity of the landscape may be reflected in the modularity of the species interaction network. We suspect that farming practices which explicitly or implicitly alter habitat heterogeneity at the farm scale may lead to alterations in modularity and have subsequent consequences for network persistence and functioning. To examine this in a real\u2010world system, we identify and describe modules in 20 well\u2010resolved and replicated whole\u2010farm networks and classify species into different functional roles, based on their relationship to other species within and between modules. Identifying key species that are structurally important in farm networks could be a critical step in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function in agroecosystems (Christianou and Ebenman 2005). In particular, we highlight \u201chub\u201d species that have a large number of links with other species in the network and whose loss may lead to a large number of secondary extinctions and the collapse of a module. We then examine if there is a relationship between module species composition and the habitat types on the farm.",

            "text": "Previous studies examining network structures have compared empirical datasets collected using a variety of methods, and this variation limits the extent to which they can be used to reach consensus and suggest general patterns. Our study used 20 networks collected using standardized techniques and sampling intensity (Cohen et al. 1993), each containing 143\u2013274 species across three trophic levels (plants, insect herbivores, and parasitoid wasps attacking the herbivores; Macfadyen et al. 2009). The study was designed so that we could incorporate a replicated experimental treatment on our analysis (the comparison of organic vs. conventional farming systems) in order to start to understand how management affects modularity in network structure. We aim to answer four questions. First, are modules present in farm food web networks? Olesen et al. (2007) found significant modularity in plant\u2013pollinator mutualistic networks consisting of >150 species and we predict that similar levels of modularity exist in plant\u2013herbivore\u2013parasitoid food webs. Second, we ask, which species are important for module structure? These species may be important for both the conservation of biodiversity on farms and the long\u2010term stability of networks (Christianou and Ebenman 2005). Third, does farm management (organic vs. conventional) affect module characteristics? Previous work has demonstrated that farming system has an impact not only on species richness but also the topology of whole\u2010farm networks (Gibson et al. 2007, Macfadyen et al. 2009) and we predict here that it may influence network modularity. Finally, we test whether there is an association between the classification of species into modules and major habitat groups on the farms. We discuss the implications of our results in terms of the provision of pest control services by parasitoid species dispersing from non\u2010crop areas to crop areas.",

Organic farms were selected first then paired with a non\u2010adjoining conventional farm of similar size within 5 km (Gibson et al. 2007, Macfadyen et al. 2009). Organic farms had, at the start of the study, an average of 7.3 years (range 3\u201312 years) since organic certification. All farms were mapped and stratified by landscape element (arable fields separated into crop types, pasture fields including grass leys, orchards, vegetable patches, field margins, game cover, rough ground, hedgerows, and woodlands) and each element then randomly sampled. All landscape elements on a farm were sampled per visit in summer 2005 but in 2006 a subset of landscape elements was sampled (arable fields, woodlands, and hedgerows) to obtain more detailed data from these areas. All sampling was carried out during spring and summer. Proportionately more effort went into sampling larger landscape elements, as a large area of a low diversity landscape element may contribute more species than a small area of a high\u2010diversity landscape element. Total sampling effort was equal between pairs (in 2005 the transect area was 150 \u00d7 1 m on six occasions, in 2006 100 \u00d7 1 m on five occasions). All vegetation (below \u223c2.5 m) in transects was recorded and visually inspected, and herbivores collected (leaf\u2010mining Diptera and Lepidoptera, and external\u2010feeding Lepidoptera). Additional herbivores were collected by sweep netting and beating the vegetation. Herbivores were reared individually until an adult herbivore or parasitoid emerged (Lewis et al. 2002). Leaf\u2010mine appearance and architecture, and host plant species, were used to identify herbivores. Dipteran leaf miners and parasitoids, plus a sub\u2010set of lepidopterans, were identified by specialist taxonomists (see Acknowledgments); individuals not identified to genus or morphospecies were excluded from the data set.",

For each farm all unique interactions between each herbivore species feeding on a plant and each parasitoid species attacking an herbivore were collated and equal weighting was given to each unique link. The plant on which an herbivore was found was recorded as the most likely feeding host. We attempted to sample only a single plant species at a time, however, beating sheets and sweep nets sample multiple plant types. In these cases we recorded multiple plant species, then checked the literature to see if only one plant species had been recorded as a feeding host and used only this species in the data set. If the herbivore was recorded as a generalist (e.g., feeding on various woody hedgerow shrubs) we assigned a single plant species randomly from the species that had been recorded. Multiple parasitoids emerging from a single host were represented as a single rearing record and the two hyper\u2010parasitoid species collected were included in the third trophic level.",

            "text": "We used the program SA\u20101 written for one\u2010mode networks rather than two\u2010mode networks following the arguments of Olesen et al. (2007). The program produces a modularity index M, which indicates the degree to which the network is organized into clear modules (Guimera and Amaral 2005a\n, \nb\n, Guimera et al. 2007) such that species have more interactions with other species within their module than expected if links are random. This approach is aimed at maximizing modularity or the partitioning of species in a network into modules with many within\u2010module links. For each farm network we ran SA\u20101 for 100 random networks of the same size to examine if the empirical farm networks were significantly more modular than the random networks. M = 0 when species are partitioned at random into modules or if all species are in the same module. This program does not ask the user to a priori specify the number of modules to assign species into and so gives an objective estimate of modularity in the networks. The program then sorts each species into different roles based on how \u201cwell connected\u201d a particular species is to other species in the module. These roles were used to determine the ecological significance of each species in the network and highlight species important for network function. These roles are defined as: R1, an ultra\u2010peripheral species (all its links are to other species within its module); R2, a peripheral species (most its links are to other species within its module); R3, a non\u2010hub connector species (a species with many links to other modules); R4, a non\u2010hub kinless species (a species with <35% of its links within the module, meaning that it cannot be clearly assigned to a single module); R5, a provincial hub (a species central to its module but with most links within the module); R6, a connector hub (a species central to its module but with many links to most other modules); and R7, kinless species (has fewer than half its links within the module so cannot be clearly assigned to a single module). Modularity (M), the total number of modules per farm, module richness (the mean number of species per module), the average number of links between modules per farm, and the proportion of lone modules (modules without links to other modules of the network) were compared between organic and conventional farms using a paired MANOVA. The program Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 2009) was used to visualize the modules in each network.",

Habitat group 1 species were found most often in arable fields. These were clearly defined fields that were annually sown to a range of crops including cereals, maize, beans, and oilseed rape (Gibson et al. 2007). Habitat group 2 species were found most often in pasture fields (permanent unimproved pastures to grass leys). Habitat group 3 species were found most often in woodlands defined as any area that had three or more trees whose canopies touched when they were in leaf. Habitat group 4 species were found most often in any of the other semi\u2010natural habitats on the farms such as hedgerows, field margins, rough ground, and game cover plots. Habitat group 5 species could not be categorized into one group as they were found equally in multiple habitat areas on the farm. For each farm the number of species in each module classified into each group was tabulated, such that the resulting data matrix consisted of rows 1\u20135 for each landscape element group and columns listing all modules found on the farm (12\u201324 modules per farm). In each cell was the number of species found in each combination of categorical variables. The number of habitat groups in each module was averaged across the farm (mean number of groups). The diversity of habitat groups (group diversity) in each module across the farm was calculated using the Shannon Diversity index (Magurran 2004). The value \u03c0 was calculated as the proportion of species found in each habitat group (1\u20135) per module. The average diversity per farm is calculated from the Shannon index for each module divided by the number of modules per farm.

Any species in group 5 (unclassified species), were removed from this analysis. As each farm matrix was large (between 4 \u00d7 12 to 4 \u00d7 24 cells in size), we used the \u201csimulate.p.value\u201d function in R which computes P values by Monte Carlo simulation (2000 replicates). This analysis was repeated on a reduced data set containing only large modules in each farm (modules with less than six species were removed) resulting in smaller matrices.

Certain plants and insect herbivores were the dominant species involved in network hub roles across all 20 farms (Fig. 2; Appendix). For example, hedgerow plant species (Corylus avellana [hazel], Crataegus monogyna [hawthorn], Prunus spinosa [blackthorn]), common farm weeds (Rubus fruticosus [bramble], Urtica dioica [stinging nettle], and Cirsium arvense [creeping thistle]), herbivorous pests (Plutella xylostella [diamond\u2010back moth]), and a number of dipteran leafminers reared mainly from grass species in pasture and grass ley fields, formed important network hubs. Notably no parasitoid species were categorized as a network hub (Fig. 2, Appendix). Two parasitoid species, Achrysocharoides cilla and Dacnusa areolaris, were non\u2010hub connector species and all other parasitoids were categorized as R1 or R2 (peripheral species). The species that were categorized as R3 (non\u2010hub connector) were unique to each farm and many farms had no species in this role. Only five of the seven universal roles identified in Guimera and Amaral (2005a\n) were present in the farm networks.

            "text": "Our results suggest that trophic interactions between the crop (arable and pasture fields) and non\u2010crop (woodlands, hedgerows, etc.) landscape elements may be minimal, and the provision of ecosystem services such as pest control by parasitoids in non\u2010crop vegetation to the crop components of the landscape is unlikely. This is not to say that parasitoids don't move between the arable and non\u2010arable areas (e.g., Schellhorn et al. 2008) and there may be other non\u2010trophic resources used by parasitoids in the semi\u2010natural areas. Rather, our results suggest that unique trophic interactions between these habitat groups were rare during the course of our study. There are some exceptions. For example, on the conventional farm shown in Fig. 2B wheat (Triticum sp.) is directly linked within its' own module to multiple herbivores and parasitoids coming from different habitat groups, and indirectly to a woodland module through a tortricid herbivore (Cnephasia spp.) that feeds on a common weed (Urtica dioica). In this case herbivores in wheat fields may be controlled directly and indirectly by parasitoids from other habitat groups on the farm. It is important to note that a whole suite of naturally occurring predator species contribute to pest control services on these farms and were not included in these networks. One advantage of focusing on parasitoids was that we were able to unambiguously identify links between parasitoids and their hosts through rearing, however we know that parasitism differs significantly from predation as a trophic strategy. The fact that one predator can attack and kill multiple prey individuals is one obvious difference that may alter food web topology (Lafferty et al. 2008). One difficulty with parasitoids is that hyper\u2010parasitism is relatively common and can result in spurious links between herbivores and parasitoids. The two hyper\u2010parasitoid species collected in this study were included in the third trophic level however ideally these should be placed in a fourth trophic level if their parasitoid host is known.",

            "text": "While we have shown that modules seem to be composed of species from one or a few landscape elements there may also be other factors influencing the modularity patterns we observed, such as divergent selection regimes or phylogenetic relatedness of species (Rezende et al. 2009). Dupont and Olesen (2009) identified modules in communities of plants and their insect flower visitors in heathlands and suggested that these modules reflect coevolutionary units. Bosch et al. (2009) related modularity observed in a plant\u2013pollinator network to phenological patterns in plant flowering times. Future research should focus on determining whether the underlying causes of modularity in ecological networks are dependent on each system or if consistent patterns exist across ecosystems. Understanding how modularity and network structure more broadly influence the provision of ecosystem services is particularly important in agroecosystems. The results presented here are based on a qualitative assessment of species interactions, however quantitative information could be used to further resolve the modularity of these networks, and previous research suggests that quantitative information is important for elucidating functionally critical alterations to species interactions (Tylianakis et al. 2007). This added detail may be important for exploring the importance of modularity as well as other nonrandom patterns in network topology, e.g., nestedness (Bascompte et al. 2003) and their relationship to ecosystems function. Furthermore, some measures we have used to compare between networks in a standardized way (e.g., the average number of links between modules per farm) have not been robustly tested. Whether or not such measures can be used as general indicators of change to network topology that lead to alterations in network functions is yet to be determined. We have described some of the modules here as \u201clone\u201d modules because they did not show any links to other modules in the farm network. However, there are no truly \u201clone\u201d modules in nature (Kondoh 2008), rather this classification is a consequence of the delineation of our landscape into sampling units useful for this study. In reality species within communities interact with each other in a variety of ways from trophic relationships (as we have shown here) to mutualistic (e.g., pollination) and competitive relationships. The underlying architecture of these interactions will affect the functioning of agroecosystems and the relationship between biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services.",
