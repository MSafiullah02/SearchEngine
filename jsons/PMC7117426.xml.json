            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease in swine characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, and watery diarrhea and has high mortality in piglets (Ducatelle et al., 1981). PED is one of the most important causes of economic loss in many swine-raising countries. This is mainly due to its high prevalence compared to the rare incidence of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and the asymptomatic characteristics of the rotavirus (RV) infections (Carvajal et al., 1995). The causative agent of PED is the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the family Coronaviridae and was first reported in 1978 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). PEDV is an enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome approximately 28 kb in size with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail. The genome comprises a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 3\u2032 UTR, and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 4 structural proteins [spike (S, 150\u2013220 kDa), envelope (E, 7 kDa), membrane (M, 20\u201330 kDa), and nucleocapsid (N, 58 kDa)] and three non-structural proteins (replicases 1a, 1b, and ORF3); these are arranged on the genome in the order 5\u2032-replicase (1a/1b)-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3\u2032 (Song and Park, 2012, Kocherhans et al., 2001, Yeo et al., 2003).",

Also, it can be used as the target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection (Song and Park, 2012). It has been suggested that N protein epitopes may be important for induction of cell-mediated immunity (Curtis et al., 2002, Saif, 1993). To date, no data exists on the subcellular localization of PEDV N proteins and its effects on cell growth and cell cycle progression. Porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are the cells targeted by PEDV and the epithelial cells in the gut serve as a physical barrier which restricts the movement of components and passage of potentially harmful microorganisms between the lumen and underlying mucosa (Schierack et al., 2005).",

After treatment with MG132, the level of IL-8 in the supernatants from control cells is significantly decreased. In contrast, there was no such change in supernatants from the GFP-N expressing cells. An investigation of the transcriptional levels of IL-8 using real-time quantitative PCR found that the mRNA levels of IL-8 in the GFP-N expressing cells is also higher than in the GFP transfected and untransfected cells (Fig. 9B). These results suggest that PEDV N up-regulates IL-8 expression in IECs.

Also, the function of this protein is yet to be determined, particularly with regard to its effect on host cell physiological changes. Recently, the N protein function of other coronaviruses also has been studied, especially in the N protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has extensively studied. The N protein of TGEV is an RNA chaperone and a naked plasmid DNA encoding the N protein of TGEV can elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses (Liu et al., 2001, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2007). Previous study suggested a correlation among the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, subcellular localization of N, induction of apoptosis, and the subsequent activation of caspases leading to cleavage of the N protein of SARS-CoV (Diemer et al., 2008). In this study, we constructed a eukaryotic expression vector and generated stably expressing cell lines of PEDV N in fusion with the GFP protein that allowed the analysis of many of these properties. Co-localization studies clearly showed that GFP-N localized in the ER. It has been reported that the N proteins of MHV and IBV localized in the nucleolus of a small number of infected cells (Wurm et al., 2001). TGEV N protein was not observed in the nucleolus of infected ST cell lines (Calvo, 2005). In the case of our study, PEDV N protein was not observed in the nucleolus of the cells by confocal microscopy.",

Recently, it was reported that the SARS-CoV N protein induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase through down-regulation of the S phase gene products expression (Surjit, 2006). One of the most critical phases during cell cycle progression is the S phase, since it can provide a cellular environment that is beneficial for viral replication. In this study, our findings show that the N protein of PEDV is able to inhibit the cell proliferation and prolongs the S-phase cell cycle. Cyclin A is very important in cells from the S phase to G2/M phase. In this study, the results of a western blot analysis show that cyclin A protein levels in PEDV N protein-expressing cell lines are significantly lower than in control cell lines. Furthermore, we also find that PEDV N protein significantly inhibits the transcription of cyclin A. These results show that the PEDV N protein plays an important role, not only in the cyclin A protein expression levels, but also in the transcription of cyclin A.",

We have shown that PEDV N protein localizes in the ER and is able to induce ER stress. This was indicated by the significant up-regulation of the molecule chaperon GRP78, a typical marker of ER stress. Under conditions of ER stress, mammalian cells accelerate the retrograde export of proteins from the ER to the cytosol for ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation (Friedlander et al., 2000, Rao and Bredesen, 2004, Schr\u00f6der and Kaufman, 2005).

Viruses use the ER as an integral part of their replication strategy and must therefore contend with the ER stress response and downstream consequences of ER stress signaling. This includes initiation of an inflammatory response through activation of NF-\u03baB (Todd et al., 2008, Waris et al., 2002, Zhang and Kaufman, 2008). IL-8 as a pro-inflammatory neutrophil chemotactic factor plays an important role in the promotion of cell survival signaling and antagonizes the anti-viral activities of interferon. Our results show that PEDV N is able to up-regulate the expression of IL-8 in IEC cells. PEDV N protein induces ER stress and significantly activates NF-\u03baB, which consequently leads to promotion of IL-8 transcription. Further research suggested that IL-8 production in control cells treated with MG132 was significantly lower than in untreated cells. However, IL-8 production from the GFP-N expressing cells treated with MG132 was not changed significantly compared with the untreated cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that MG132 is capable of inhibiting IL-8 production in control cells and PEDV N protein seems to antagonize the function of MG132.",

Previous study suggests that the expression of Bcl-2 is regulated by the NF-\u03baB (Fahy et al., 2005). In this study, the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 was significantly elevated in PEDV N protein expressing cells.

S-phase prolongation is associated with an increase in cyclin A degradation and a decrease in cyclin A transcription level. The PEDV N protein is able to up-regulate IL-8 expression in IECs. The up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression is ascribed to the ER stress response and activation of NF-\u03baB induced by PEDV N. Thus, the data suggest that PEDV N likely plays an important role in the inflammatory response and in persistent PEDV infection.
