Research about sustainability in computer science aims to offer methods, techniques and tools to lessen the impact of new technologies on the environment, to offer a better world, a smarter life, to the next generations. Information systems must participate in the collective effort to move towards sustainable development, and software and application companies must lead a CSR strategy to achieve this aim. Moreover, beyond an individual company approach, sustainability should be seen as an integral quality of any software (as well as safety, performance or reliability). All of this seem obvious at a time when applications and programs of all kinds are ubiquitous in everyday life. Nevertheless, the challenges of sustainable development have still not been considered in certain key sectors such as the development of information technology. A lot of ecolabels exist for a lot of different products, although not for software sustainability. We propose in this work an ecolabel for software sustainability, based on a set of relevant criteria found in different works.",

As defined for the first time in 1987 in the Brundtland Report, \u00abhumanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs [1] .

In this context, information technologies have an ambivalent role: they reduce the impact on the environment in certain contexts of use, notably through virtualization or business process optimization. However, in other cases they are themselves responsible for negative effects on the environment, such as the very energy-intensive use of data centers [3] . This global dematerialization continues, particularly with the transition to the cloud, making IT responsible for 10% of global electricity consumption in 2017 [4] . Information technology must therefore be fully considered in sustainable development actions and more particularly in companies social and environmental responsibility (CSR) strategies. It is therefore essential to be able to provide models, methods and tools which allow, first, to measure and assess the impact of technologies on the environment, and then, second, to be able to apply tools in the development process of these technologies in order to improve their sustainability.",

The data centers are particularly targeted by the objectives of reducing energy consumption in the IT sector, considering both their importance in the infrastructure of enterprises and their data, and their considerable energy requirements. In 2012, the European Union even took the lead by launching a project called GAMES (Green Active Management of Energy in IT Service centers), which aims to develop a set of tools, methods and techniques for managing the energy performance of next-generation data centers [7] . For both data centers and other information technology infrastructure and services, the source of energy consumption is in the software layer [8] .

The software layer is therefore an important if not crucial lever in reducing ICT energy consumption.",

By engaging in the implementation of digital technology certifications and labels, governments, particularly at European and global levels, would help legitimise software eco-design in the eyes of users. Companies that make the effort to achieve a sustainable strategy in the development of their products also gain credibility compared to their competitors when this approach is formally recognized [16] . A sustainability label for digital software and services such as EcoSoft would therefore serve this objective of bringing more visibility and therefore credibility to ecodesign in the software field.

Reducing the number of backups can also be a possible optimization. By eliminating the problem of constantly backing up the same copy of a file again and again, data de-duplication can decrease backup storage consumption by 10 to 50 times compared to traditional tape-based backup methods. Since less data is sent across the infrastructure, data de-duplication also can reduce the bandwidth consumed by traditional network-based backups by up to 500 times [34].",

EcoSoft is an eco-label that takes into account the involvement of stakeholders (project manager, software architects, developers) in the process of integrating sustainability into the project. The three stages of the software's life cycle, namely the development, usage and end of life, are analyzed to determine the environmental impacts they generate. We focused the analysis on the energy consumption of software components, which is an important aspect for the overall quality of the software, especially for the user experience on the mobile device, but also because digital energy consumption has a high environmental footprint. The field of software and its technologies is constantly evolving, especially in the forms that the software can take. In this sense, the label could evolve by adapting the criteria to the type of software analyzed in order to be able to take into account its specificities (application software, web applications, system software\u2026).",
