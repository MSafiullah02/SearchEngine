Traditionally, the paramedic profession has been educated to respond to life-threatening medical emergencies.1 Paramedics are increasingly expected to respond to behavioral health crises but may not be adequately prepared to do so. 1 There has been limited research regarding paramedics\u2019 experiences, attitudes, and perceptions about responding to behavioral health crises, with a particular dearth of literature on this subject from the USA. 1\u20135 As the first point of contact, paramedics may influence the quality of care individuals experiencing behavioral health emergencies receive, rendering this gap in knowledge concerning. 1,4 Paramedics encounter a range of behavioral health crises, from individuals who have self-harmed, substance use, to older adults experiencing social isolation. 6,7 This study aimed to answer the following questions: Do paramedics feel well prepared to respond to behavioral health crises? How do paramedics describe the challenges and facilitators involved in responding to these situations? What are the skills they use to respond to these situations? The present study examined paramedics\u2019 experiences and perceptions regarding behavioral health emergencies, aiming to address a significant gap in the literature on paramedics\u2019 ability to respond to the needs of individuals experiencing behavioral health crises.",

In a survey of members of the College of Paramedics (UK), 98% of the 623 respondents endorsed the need for increased mental health education and training. 2 Paramedic training curriculums in the UK have evolved to incorporate more of an emphasis on behavioral health, yet whether or not this behavioral health training is effective has not yet been investigated. 1 Several Australian studies investigated paramedic perceptions of their mental health training and decision-making during mental health emergencies.5,8 Paramedic participants reported inadequate mental health training and indicated a need for increased education on mental illness, particularly regarding possible treatment options that are feasible as part of prehospital care.8 Paramedics described relying more on intuition than education when faced with challenging cases.5 In a mixed methods study, Australian paramedics reported the need for more education on how to adequately respond to older adults experiencing complex mental health crises including depression, social isolation, and food insecurity.7",

Early readings of the transcript data allowed the researchers to develop preliminary ideas regarding potential themes.

During this stage, the researchers met frequently to compare and contrast the results of each individual\u2019s analysis, reviewing emerging themes and collaborating to refine themes into a coherent set. To asses inter-rater reliability, two un-read transcripts were reviewed by all team members and coded independently, followed by meetings as a research team to compare coding decisions on each transcript and reconcile any discrepancies. This rigorous process helped to ensure strong inter-rater reliability as we were able to gain consensus in our coding process for all other transcripts. Researchers individually arranged transcript data verbatim into groups of initial themes, and a master document was then created collaboratively, which outlined each finalized theme and included transcript excerpts embodying each theme.",

Once certified, paramedics must undergo periodic recertification, which requires both exams and evidence of continuing education\u2014this could be a key point of intervention for a robust behavioral health training. This data clearly demonstrates that the paramedic profession needs\u2014and endorses the need for\u2014additional behavioral health training: a review of paramedic education and training curriculums across the USA would aid understanding of how to improve upon current behavioral health education for paramedics. The effectiveness of fairly recently implemented behavioral health education for paramedics in the UK has not been investigated1,4\u2014a similar gap appears to exist in the USA. Further research should evaluate existing behavioral health training for paramedics in order to better understand how current practices may be failing to adequately prepare paramedics in this area. Enhanced education and training on this subject has the potential to improve paramedics\u2019 ability to fully respond to the needs of patients in times of behavioral health crises. Although literature specifically focusing on prehospital providers is lacking, research on behavioral health training of emergency department providers indicates that such training has the potential to improve behavioral health care. 18 Training in behavioral health for medical professionals has traditionally been thought of as secondary or less important, in the context of all that one needs to learn to be a competent medical practitioner,1 but as this study illustrates, interactions with patients who are having a behavioral health crisis are common and can be challenging. Improved behavioral health training, either in their time of certification or during times of recertification and continuing education, for paramedics may improve care for individuals experiencing behavioral health emergencies in the community and can be a key point of intervention.",

Again, training would strengthen this referral link as training can increase the paramedic\u2019s capacity to identify behavioral health concerns more effectively, therefore increasing their capacity to refer with greater confidence. Structured and standardized behavioral health training could serve as a key point of intervention, improving job satisfaction for paramedics by enabling them to more confidently manage increasingly complex behavioral health calls, and most importantly, better serving individuals with behavioral health disorders. Improved capacity for care at the prehospital stage of intervention could potentially reduce unnecessary emergency room transfers and/or medical interventions for people experiencing behavioral health emergencies, reducing potential harm and preventing additional distress to the patients served, and ultimately benefitting the health care system as a whole.",
