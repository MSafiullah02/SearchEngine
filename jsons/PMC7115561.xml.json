            "text": "The genetic diversity of swine influenza A virus (SIV) in North America has increased in the last two decades. However, the majority of the SIV infections in pigs are caused by subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 [1]. Emergence of the H3N2 subtype containing a triple reassortment internal gene (TRIG) cassette contributed vastly to the generation of antigenic divergent reassortant viruses [2], [3]. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene in these H3N2 viruses was derived from the different seasonal human influenza viruses. Subtypes containing H1 also exhibited a high rate of divergence and are currently classified into clusters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. The emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (H1N1 pdm09) and its subsequent reassortments with the recent H3N2 variant increased the antigenic variation of SIV [4], [5], [6], [7]. A combination of some of the HA gene alleles and TRIG cassettes might be contributing towards survival and propagation of emerging SIV variants in pigs [8]. Establishment of these antigenic variants in the swine population poses a zoonotic threat as they can be transmitted to humans. Current vaccine approaches are inadequate to counter the antigenic diversity of SIV because the vaccine-derived protective immunity is typically strain-specific [9], [10].",

            "text": "Vaccination against SIV is routinely employed in swine farms. Most of the commercial vaccines are bivalent or trivalent and contain whole inactivated virus. The SIV strains used in these vaccines vary between regions and their protective efficacies depend on the strains prevalent in those areas. Although inactivated vaccines are effective against homologous strains, only limited protection is offered against heterologous strains [11], [12]. Moreover, inactivated SIV vaccines are also associated with development of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) [13], [14]. This happens when the vaccine and challenge strains belong to the same subtype but differ due to antigenic drift. Another weakness of currently employed commercial inactivated vaccines is that these products are administered by an intramuscular route and do not induce adequate mucosal immunity [15]. This is important because cross-protective activity of influenza vaccines is largely correlated to mucosal immunity. Intranasal administration of live attenuated SIV vaccines containing virus with truncated NS1 protein [16] and modified HA protein [17], [18] developed both mucosal and humoral antibodies in different animal species. Similarly, an intranasal inoculation of seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccine provided mucosal immunity in mice [19]. These vaccines provided protection against both homologous and heterologous strains. Intranasal vaccine administration induced a higher secretory IgA production when compared with administration by the parenteral route. The IgA antibodies, which have higher avidity than IgG antibodies, can readily access mucosal viral antigens and are able to provide protection against heterologous strains [20]. Furthermore, use of an effective mucosal adjuvant in conjunction with intranasal vaccine administration could enhance vaccine efficiency. Poly (I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA, has been demonstrated as a potent adjuvant capable of enhancing the host innate immune response. Intranasal administration of a bivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine along with poly (I:C) protected mice from heterologous strains [19].",

CO99 virus was obtained from Dr. J.A. Richt, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS.

After 48 h, the virus-infected cultures were frozen and thawed three times. The cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation and supernatants were inactivated by a UV irradiation using a UV lamp at 254 nm for 40 min (UVS-28 EL series; Entela, Upland, CA). Virus inactivation was confirmed by the inability of these viruses to replicate in MDCK and MK1-OSU cells.

A previous study in mice demonstrated that intranasal administration of Poly I:C adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine induced an increased IgA titer in nasal washings and provided protection from both homologous and heterologous virus challenge [27]. A similar finding was reported recently in humans when Ampligen\u00ae (synthetic poly I:C) was used as an adjuvant along with FluMist\u00ae vaccine [29]. Similarly in our study, the intranasal administration of PAV provided protection against heterologous SIV in pigs and we also observed higher IgA titers in the lungs of PAV vaccinated pigs as compared to CV vaccinated pigs. Therefore, as observed in previous studies in mice and humans [19], [27], [29], higher IgA titers in the lungs of PAV vaccinated pigs may be involved in inducing cross-protective immunity against antigenic variant H1N1 and heterologous H1N2 SIV.",

Previously, VAERD has been reported in pigs vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccines followed by challenge with heterologous virus [14], [36], [37]. Although the mechanisms for VAERD is poorly defined, recent research suggests that one of the contributing factors could be production of cross-reactive IgG against non-neutralizing epitopes [13], [36]. Similar to an inactivated swine influenza vaccine induced VAERD, intranasal administration of UV inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine in mice induced extensive eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs which could enhance the respiratory disease [38]. Also, the immune response was skewed towards Th2 cell activation resulting in production of excessive antibodies. However, administration of a combination of TLR agonists including Poly I:C along with UV inactivated SARS vaccine reduced eosinophilic infiltration, shifted the immune response to Th1 cell mediated immunity, and produced high neutralizing antibody titers [38]. In the present study, we used Poly I:C as an adjuvant to UV-inactivated SIV vaccine and observed significant protection against challenge with antigenic variant and heterologous SIV without the evidence of VAERD. Collectively, our findings and previous findings on the SARS vaccine study suggest that poly I:C has a protective effect against VAERD.",

An efficient vaccine could prevent virus replication in the airways and thus reduce the virus shedding. There is a positive correlation between virus shedding in nasal secretions and the possibility of a previously uninfected pigs getting infected through aerosol. Therefore, it is pertinent that even vaccines yielding partial protection could slow the rate of influenza transmission. The pigs that received PAV shed significantly less virus through nasal discharge on both DPC 3 and 6 when infected with the antigenic variant or the heterologous strain. Additionally, the virus load in the lung at DPC 6 was significantly lower in PAV immunized group compared with NV challenged with MN08 or NC10. These findings suggest that PAV vaccination conferred effective protection against both homologous and heterologous strains.",

In humans, efficacy and safety of Ampligen (synthetic poly I:C) are being tested in clinical experiments. Our preliminary findings suggest that PAV-immunized pigs were protected from influenza challenge and that the use of Poly I:C as an adjuvant with an inactivated vaccine did not cause VAERD in pigs. However, protection was incomplete. Therefore, additional studies are required for optimizing the vaccine and Poly I:C dosing to further enhance the cross-protective efficacy of PAV and its usefulness in field situations.",
