In temperate climates, RSV infections occur as annual community outbreaks, often lasting several months during late fall, winter, and early spring. RSV is spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. RSV is unstable in the environment, surviving only a few hours on environmental surfaces, and it is readily inactivated with soap and water (Ryan and Ray 2010 ; Paddock 2001 , 2008 ) .",

Two surface glycoproteins, G and F, are present in the envelope and mediate attachment and fusion with cells of the respiratory epithelium. The F proteins also mediate coalescence of neighboring cells to form the characteristic syncytial cells for which the virus receives its name (Ryan and Ray 2010 ) . The epidemiologic and biologic signifi cance of the two antigenic variants of RSV is uncertain. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Group A infections tend to be more severe (Domachowske and Rosenberg 1999 ; Ryan and Ray 2010 ) .",

The incubation period is followed by rhinitis and, in quick succession, within 1-3 additional days, by manifestations of bronchiolitis or pneumonitis. Manifestations of both bronchiolitis and pneumonia include fever, cough, and dyspnea. These manifestations are age related and tend to be severe in infants. The overall duration of the illness is up to 14 days. Older infants, children, and adults are also readily infected, but the disease in these age groups tends to be milder. One exception is elderly adult patients, who are prone to experience considerable morbidity. The greater severity of the disease in infants is believed to be related to inherent narrow airways and further narrowing of the tracheobronchial tree brought about by mucosal swelling.",

            "text": "In contrast to other viruses such as infl uenza that affect multiple organs and systems, RSV infections are limited to the respiratory tract. In RSV, the lungs may be heavy and diffusely fi rm and may show areas of atelectasis. Large and small airways can contain necrotic debris and mucus and may show mucosal ulcerations. Within a short time of infection, a striking interstitial mononuclear (chiefl y lymphocytic) pneumonia develops. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells and after maturation buds off from cell membranes, spreading to neighboring cells. The epithelial cells swell, desquamate, and die, mixing with mucoid secretions and forming casts that partially or completely block the lumen of smaller airways (Haselton 1996 ) . Cases with associated diffuse alveolar damage do occur. In addition, organizational changes and secondary bacterial superinfection may supervene (Zaki and Paddock 2001 ) . Giant cell pneumonia with numerous multinucleated giant cells is characteristic but not pathognomonic, as it may occur in other conditions including aspiration pneumonitis and other viral pneumonias (see differential diagnosis below). The multinucleated giant cells contain many somewhat peripherally distributed nuclei. These inclusions may be inconspicuous and may be diffi cult to identify with any degree of certainty. The diagnosis of RSV pneumonia can be made with some assurance when variably sized but generally small, irregular, slightly granular, and weakly eosinophilic inclusions are found in the cytoplasm of alveolar and/or bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig. 11 .1 ) (Sherri's Medical Micro 2010 ; Paddock 2001 , 2008 ) .",

            "text": "Defi nitive diagnosis depends on laboratory confi rmation. The most defi nitive test is isolation of the virus in cell culture media. RSV grows in HEp2 cells, HeLa cells, and cells adapted from type II human alveolar epithelial carcinoma cells, known as A549. Optimal specimens can be obtained by gentle aspiration of nasal or nasopharyngeal secretions or more commonly by nasal swabs. RSV can also be detected in macrophages recovered from BAL fl uids or from epithelial cells of patients with a background of marrow, heart, lung, or renal transplants (Collins and Crowe 2002 ; Haselton 1996 ) . In addition to viral isolation, the diagnosis can be established by direct detection of viral antigen in clinical specimens, using enzyme-linked immunoassay, immunofl uorescence, immunohistochemistry, or detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR or by demonstration of a rise in RSV-specifi c serum antibodies. The virus is extremely labile and does not survive long, and attempts at culture isolation may fail if there is a delay in the submission of the clinical specimen to the laboratory (Zaki and Paddock 2008 ) . Another diagnostic modality is ultrastructural analysis of the virion. An analysis showing pleomorphic features, size within recognized limits (see above), and numerous 12 nm glycoprotein spikes coupled with appropriate clinical and serological data can be regarded as consistent with RSV infection. In our laboratory we screen specimens with a solid-phase EIA, a test that has good specifi city and a rapid (less than 1 h) turnaround time. In the event of a negative EIA result, we proceed with a more sensitive test such as direct immunofl uorescence (DFA), viral culture, or molecular testing. The sensitivity of DFA is comparable to that of viral culture and, if positive, can be regarded as diagnostic.",

These pneumonias include measles, parainfl uenza, and varicella/herpes zoster pneumonias. Human metapneumovirus (MPV) produces changes comparable to RSV and should also be included in the differential diagnosis (Kradin and Mark 2010 ) .
