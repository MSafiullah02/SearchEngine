In clinical practice this difference can be important in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic terms, since interferons with high specific activity can be used at low protein concentrations relative to interferons with low specific activity. However, our data based on the use of IU/mL suggest that even in the case of application of same protein concentrations interferon beta (specific activity 3\u00b72\u00d7107 IU/mg) would be better than interferon alfa (2\u20132\u00b74\u00d7108 IU/mg) in terms of antiviral activity.",

The results (not presented in our research letter) showed higher antiviral potency for interferon beta than for interferon alfa independent of specific activity\u2014ie, interferon beta-1a has a specific activity (2\u00d7108 IU/mg) similar to interferon alfa-2b, but its antiviral activity was about 40 times higher.",

CC50 value higher than 10 000 simply means that antiviral effects in our culture system are not due to non-specific toxic effects. Our initial experiments were undertaken with a range of concentrations that are commonly used in in-vitro investigations. In additional experiments done by us, interferon concentrations up to 106 IU/mL were used without increased toxicity of interferon beta versus interferon alfa in confluent layers of Vero cells.",

Treatment of patients who have SARS with interferon alfa and restricted use of steroids did not improve clinical symptoms and signs.2 This finding could be explained at least partly by our observations, indicating an inability of interferon alfa to inhibit SARS-CoV replication when added to cultured cells after virus infection. Therefore, the selective antiviral activity of interferon beta justifies its clinical testing in patients with SARS.",
