We developed an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure levels of total antireovirus immunoglobulin A, G, and M in serum specimens collected from otherwise healthy infants and children (1 month to 5 years of age) in Nashville, Tennessee. Of the 272 serum specimens evaluated, 64 (23.5%) tested positive for reovirus-specific antibodies. We observed an age-dependent increase in reovirus-specific antibodies in children 1 year of age and older, peaking at 50.0% in children 5-6 years of age. These findings suggest that reovirus infections are common during early childhood.",

A certain small proportion of those infected, however, may develop severe clinical disease, including neonatal extrahepatic biliary atresia or meningitis [4, 5] . Since reoviruses display agedependent virulence in experimental animals [11, 12] , these severe manifestations would be anticipated to occur only in the very young.
