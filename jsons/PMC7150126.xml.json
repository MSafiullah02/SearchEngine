            "text": "The global migration landscape has undergone substantial changes in the past quarter century, and the number of population groups contributing to global mobility is steadily rising. The Human Development Report 2009 by the United Nations Development Program estimates 70 million migrants have moved from developing countries to developed ones and more than 200 million migrants have moved between developing countries.1 Migration is truly a major social phenomenon, with many complex linkages to economic, trade, social, security, and health policies. In the dynamic relationship between migration and health, immigration has long been recognized as having a large impact on disease epidemiology and the use of health services in migrant receiving nations.2, 3 For example, the impact of immigration on disease epidemiology is demonstrated by the global epidemiology of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality; however, rates of TB in most regions of the developing world are many times higher than those in the developed world (the TB prevalence gap) and are decreasing at a much slower rate.4 Many migrant-receiving countries in the developed world have had stable or increased migration of persons from regions with high TB prevalence, while at the same time having successfully decreased TB incidence in their native-borne population, further exacerbating the prevalence gap. Consequently, the majority of TB cases in migrant-receiving countries such as the United States and Canada are now being diagnosed in foreign-born populations from high-prevalence source countries5, 6 (Fig. 127.1\n). This linkage between migration and TB epidemiology becomes more significant when designing solutions for the control and prevention of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and the emerging threat of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB.7, 8, 9, 10\n",

The diseases most frequently tested to determine visa eligibility or admissibility of a migrant are infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, and mental or behavioral conditions. Immigration regulations in some countries do allow for the consideration of medical waivers to inadmissible health conditions. Although many migrant-receiving countries in Europe either do not require prearrival health evaluations or have fewer requirements and only limited grounds for refusal of admission based on health grounds, most have provisions for notification and inspection if a communicable or serious health condition is recognized or suspected.16\n",

In both waves of migration, migrants have brought with them not only skills and cultural traditions that enriched US economic and social fabric, but also diseases and disease exposures that were different from those existing in US-receiving communities. In addition, twenty-first century migrants are more mobile and remain connected to their countries of birth, typically making several back and forth journeys to visit friends and relatives.18 New immigrants and refugees, who cross disease prevalence gaps and frequently travel to visit friends and relatives, constitute potentially high-risk populations for translocating communicable diseases of public health significance.",

The majority of these nonimmigrant migrants admitted are not required to undergo health screening prior to US entry. Given the immense numbers of persons crossing US borders and finite resources for evaluation and surveillance, US migrant health screening policy focuses on migrants planning to establish permanent US residence, since this group has the largest potential long-term impact on both disease epidemiology and health care resources utilization. Currently, the US Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires that medical screening examinations be performed overseas for all US-bound immigrants and refugees, and in the United States for migrants applying to adjust their visa status to permanent residence (i.e. \u201cgreen cards\u201d).20, 21 In 2008, the over 1 million immigrants (adjustment of status and new arrivals) and refugees admitted underwent medical screening examinations prior to their admission. The remainder of this chapter covers US medical screening issues for immigrants and refugees. Similar issues and regulations apply across developed and developing countries worldwide. Disease transmission among refugees crowded into camps in resource-limited countries further accentuates the huge importance of international refugee public health preparedness.",

Trends in the number and regions of origin for US-arriving immigrants and refugees have important public health implications in determining the medical evaluation and treatment of these two groups, both overseas and stateside.19, 22 From 2006 to 2008, over 1.3 million immigrants arrived in the United States; the number of arrivals and regions of origin remained relatively stable over this 3-year period (Fig. 127.2\n). On average, approximately 450 000 immigrants arrived each year, most of these arriving from Asia (majority from China) and the Americas (majority from Mexico), followed by Europe and Africa. From 2006 to 2008, close to 150 000 refugees arrived in the United States; in contrast to immigrants, the number of arrivals and regions of origin have changed markedly over this 3-year period (Fig. 127.3\n). In 2006, the majority of arriving refugees (45%) were from Africa, 25% from Europe, and only 20% of arriving refugees were from Asia. In contrast, in 2008, almost 75% (approximately 45 000 refugees) arrived from Asia. Trends have important implications for medical evaluation and treatment, both overseas and stateside, as refugees from Africa have relatively high rates of certain diseases, including immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, TB, malaria, intestinal helminth infections and other tropical diseases (e.g. schistosomiasis), and likely lack routine vaccinations.23, 24 Similarly, epidemiological information from Southeast Asia, such as reports of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum are valuable in alerting on the need to invest in preventive and health promotion activities.25\n",

The ERHP currently focuses on refugees for a number of reasons: (1) refugees are vulnerable populations, exposed to a variety of harsh environmental conditions and diverse diseases, with limited access to health care; (2) a unique opportunity exists to address refugee health concerns during required overseas health assessments; (3) the language and charge of the US Refugee Act provide more latitude to address conditions of public health concern among refugees (in addition to inadmissible conditions); and (4) lessons learned from a focus on the smaller number of refugees may be potentially applicable to the larger numbers of immigrants or other migrant groups.",

These programs have included components to provide presumptive predeparture treatment for malaria, intestinal parasites, and other tropical diseases, expanded TB diagnosis and treatment, HIV services, appropriate immunizations, dental and mental health assessments, chronic disease evaluations, and postarrival treatment for schistosomiasis and strongyloides infection. These programs have successfully prevented thousands of cases of intestinal parasitosis, malaria, TB, and vaccine-preventable diseases and hundreds of cases of other communicable diseases among US-bound refugees.50, 51, 52 Other integral components of the ERHP initiative have been efforts to provide linkages to US programs in host countries, such as the Global AIDS Program (GAP) and the Global Disease Detection (GDD) Program, which can provide diagnostic, treatment and prevention services to refugees awaiting US resettlement. Such efforts are aimed at assuring refugees access to needed health care services in a prompt manner even while still in asylum countries prior to US resettlement, and to reduce the burden placed on host country resources, since overseas interventions can decrease refugee health utilization once in the United States, reduce treatment cost, and avoid overburdening the domestic health system. Finally, some more recent ERHP programs have included enhanced surveillance and response for emerging infectious diseases, including vector-borne and vaccine-preventable diseases, and most recently, 2009 H1N1 flu and H5N1 avian influenza. As part of the EHRP for Liberian refugees in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, field staff were able to identify O\u2019nyong-nyong fever, an emerging infectious disease in West Africa, and prevent its importation.53\n",
