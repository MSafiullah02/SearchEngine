The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the urgent need for effective public health countermeasures due to the ongoing epidemic, and MERS-CoV is on the WHO list of priority pathogens to highlight the critical need for the development of diagnostic products and prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options [1]. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Systems Biology for Infectious Disease Research Program was established to support research focusing on multi-omics approaches and dataset integration to develop and validate predictive models of infectious disease initiation, progression, and outcomes [2]. Thus, there is great interest and need for improved understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV; however, challenges remain in effective study of this pathogen.",

They also function in host-pathogen interactions and immunomodulation since they act in first-line recognition and host cell signaling during pathogen docking, invasion, and intracellular trafficking [18]. Lipid metabolism and cellular lipids are greatly affected by virus infections by inducing major lipid modifications within host cells through the production of convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles (DMVs) [19\u201322]. Virus-induced production of membrane networks and organelles is a common occurrence among all positive sense RNA viruses [23, 24]. The roles of these virus-induced DMVs are not fully understood; however, evidence suggests some viruses may use them for replication, to conceal viral RNA from host antiviral response, or they may have roles in autophagy as autophagosomes [25].",

The LC gradient starts with a linear increase of solvent B to 10% in 10 min, then a linear increase to 20% B in 15 min, and 30 min to 30% B, 15 min to 35% B, 10 min to 45% B, and another 10 min to 100% solvent B. The flow rate is 0.5 mL/min [35].Without collecting the first 15 min, a total of 96 fractions are collected into a 96-well plate throughout the LC gradient in equal time intervals.At this point the plate can be frozen or dried down in vacuo.After the fractions are dried, each fraction is reconstituted in 100 \u03bcL of 50% MeOH. Concatenate the 96 fractions into 24 samples by combining every other row [35], and concentrate again in vacuo to remove MeOH in the samples.Determine the peptide concentration of each fraction using the BCA protein assay kit and dilute each of them to 0.1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL with H2O.

            "text": "The LC-MS conditions presented in this section represent a typical method for analysis of isobaric labeled peptides (TMT-10plex\u2122 Isobaric Labeling Reagent, Thermo Scientific). Use of this specific labeling reagent requires a MS capable of achieving >30k mass resolution in order to baseline resolve all reporter ions. However, other isobaric labeling reagents are available that do not require this level of resolution for labs not possessing instrumentation with this capability. Isobaric labeling strategies provide several benefits including multiplexing of large cohorts to improve throughput; use of a reference channel for data normalization; and improved quantitation due to elimination of run-to-run variation and reduction in sample processing variability. However, the data also suffer from \u201ccompression,\u201d where signals from co-eluting peptides can affect reporter ion accuracy. There are several ways to mitigate this compression effect and one of the primary means is off-line fractionation of samples to reduce sample complexity. Another method uses the additional specificity of MS3 analysis (e.g., Thermo Scientific\u2019s SPS MS3 workflow) where interference is reduced through a second MS/MS of primary fragment ions from the first MS/MS scan. This MS3 technique does not generally preclude the need for off-line fractionation. Interference can still occur, although it is generally minimized because the product ions selected for MS3 are more likely to be unique to a single peptide. The disadvantage of using MS3 is a significant hit on instrument duty cycle. It simply requires more time to perform the additional MS/MS event on primary fragment ions from every precursor ion. The method presented here uses only MS/MS, favoring an increased peptide identification rate over reduction in compression. For the purpose of this section, parameters for an M-Class nanoAcquity dual pumping UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA) coupled with a Q Exactive HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MSare described.UPLC Setup:Prepare analytical and trapping columns in-house by slurry packing Jupiter 3 \u03bcm and 5 \u03bcm C-18 media into a 70-cm length of 360 \u03bcm o.d. \u00d7 75 \u03bcm i.d., and 4-cm length of 360 \u03bcm o.d. \u00d7 150 \u03bcm i.d. of fused silica, respectively. Use Kasil-based frits for retention of packing material.Install the analytical and trap columns in a configuration such that once the sample has been trapped and washed, it is eluted in the opposite direction onto the analytical column.Prepare mobile phases (MP); MP A: 0.1% formic acid in water and MP B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.Set injection volume to 5 \u03bcL using a 5 \u03bcL sample loop and a 1.2\u00d7 overfill value, resulting in a total of 7 \u03bcL of sample being pulled from the autosampler vial for each injection.Set the trapping flow rate at 5 \u03bcL/min and a total trap time of 8 min.Set the analytical flow rate to 300 nL/min with the following gradient and wash profile (min:%B); 0:1, 8:1, 10:8, 28:12, 83:30, 105:45, 108:95, 118:95, 122:50, 124:95, 126:1, 128:50, 130:50, 132:1, 152:1.Events (min:event); 8:end trapping and start gradient, 28:start data acquisition, 108:end gradient and start column wash, 132:end column wash, 148:end data acquisition, 152:end column re-equilibration.Coupling UPLC to MS:Couple the UPLC with the MS using a Nanospray Flex Ion Source, attaching the standard metal emitter tip that comes with the source to the end of the analytical column.MS Setup:Perform required cleaning and/or calibrations. A full calibration is completed after the instrument has been deep cleaned (all optics cleaned up to and including the selection quadrupole). Otherwise, only mass calibrations are performed as needed (discussed in the QC section to follow).Create a tune file that uses an ion transfer tube temperature of 325 \u00b0C and a spray voltage of 2 kV.Create a data-dependent exclusion method with precursor settings using; mass range m/z 300\u20131800, resolution 60k, AGC target 3e6, max ion time 20 ms, and spectrum data type profile. For MS/MS settings, loop count 12, isolation width 0.7, resolution 30k, AGC target 1e5, max ion time 100 ms, fixed first mass m/z 110, normalized collision energy 30, and spectrum data type centroid. Additional settings include: min AGC target 5 \u00d7 103; intensity threshold 5 \u00d7 104; charge exclusion unassigned and 1; peptide match preferred; exclude isotopes on; dynamic exclusion 30 s; if idle do not pick others. Total acquisition time 120 min. Assume any other parameters listed were left with default settings.Quality Control (QC):Add QC standard runs in a matter consistent with the goals of your research and the expected quality of your samples. If, during the course of method development, the samples are relatively \u201cdirty,\u201d then consider running QC standards daily or where reasonable between batches or blocks.Select a QC standard that is similar to the samples that will be analyzed and assure enough material is on hand to conduct the entire study. For example, a 125 ng injection of RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (whole cell tryptic digest) would serve as a good QC standard for most mammalian cell studies (see\nNote 14).Once a QC baseline has been established, run sample batches and blocks such that they are bracketed by QC standard runs. Only sample runs bracketed by acceptable QC standard runs are to be used (see\nNote 15).Visually inspect each run, looking for shifts in retention time of common peaks and changes in signal stability and intensity.Monitor mass accuracy by calculating the mass error for a commonly observed contaminant (e.g., polysiloxane) that produces a singly charged ion having a mass (m/z) of 445.1200.QC samples should be run at least weekly, between sample batches, or anytime instrument performance is in question.",

The BTLE QC sample is injected and analyzed together with the samples as a means to monitor system performance, such as retention time, peak intensity, peak shape, and mass measurement error using data acquisition software. Furthermore, the BTLE QC sample is injected and analyzed after cleaning and calibration of the instrument, replacing the analytical column or any maintenance performed on the system.Add the following sequence to the beginning and end of the sample queue to monitor carryover and instrument performance: methanol blank, QC, methanol blank.For large sample sets insert the sequence from step 12 throughout the queue as necessary.Total Lipid Extracts (TLEs) are stored in 2:1 chloroform:methanol and evaporated in vacuo, then reconstituted in 5 \u03bcL chloroform and 45 \u03bcL of methanol prior to injecting 10 \u03bcL onto the column.\n",

            "text": "For the proteomics data analysis, there is a variety of commercial and open-source tools currently available. The analysis parameters are also by the preference of the user. In our laboratory, we regularly perform proteomic analysis with a combination of msConvert (for spectrum to peak list conversion) [28], mzRefinery (for mass recalibration) [29], MS-GF+ (for peptide/protein identification) [30], and MASIC (for quantification) [31].Peak list conversion with msConvert parameters:Convert to _DTA.txt format.Convert to centroid peak.Mass recalibration with mzRefinery parameters:Same searching parameters described below.Peptide/protein identification with MS-GF+:Protein sequence database. The database can be downloaded from a variety of sources, such as RefSeq, UniprotKB, and Ensembl. For human cells, we recommend using Swiss-Prot, which is available at www.uniprot.org.Searching parameters:Enzyme: Trypsin.Number of tolerable termini: 1 (partial trypsin digestion).Minimum peptide length: 6.Maximum Peptide Length: 50.Number of matches per spectrum: 1.Variable modifications: methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da).Fixed modifications: cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0215).Parent mass tolerance: 20 ppm.Isotope error: \u22121 and 1.Targeted Decoy Analysis: true.Fragmentation method: automatic detected (as written in the spectrum).Instrument: QExactive.Filter searching results based on MS-GF probability score. Usually, a score \u22641 \u00d7 10\u221210 results in a false-discovery rate \u22641%.Extraction of quantitative information with MASIC. Parameters:Mass tolerance for reporter ions: 0.003 m/z.The identified peptides and reporter ion intensities can be combined using Microsoft Access. Sum the intensities of multiple spectra of the same peptide and multiple peptides of the same protein.Expected results: the number of identified peptides and proteins will vary according to the mass spectrometer and peptide separation strategy. For instance, mammalian cells infected with MERS-CoV prefractionated into 24 fractions and analyzed in a 100-min gradient on a QExactive mass spectrometer should lead to the identification of 8000\u201310,000 proteins.Troubleshooting: If the number of identified proteins is much smaller than expected, check the following items:Contamination: detergents and plasticizers are common contaminants in samples and they have a characteristic profile in LC-MS/MS data by having uniform mass and retention time shifts. The solution to this problem is to eliminate the source of these contaminants by washing the glassware, avoiding detergents during sample preparation steps and checking the compatibility of used plastic tubes with the extraction solvents.Searching parameters: another source of poor coverage can be due to incorrect searching parameters. Check the sequence database (if correct species was used, for instance), enzyme specificity, and peptide modifications.",

Once it is opened, moisture in the air can reduce the reactivity of the reagent. It can cause skin corrosion, serious eye damage, and specific target organ toxicity, and is a flammable liquid and vapor.

A fresh tip must be used each time after chloroform is dispensed.The Sorenson brand tubes have shown to be compatible with chloroform and do not leach polymers that can interfere with downstream analysis.Three sets of Sorenson tubes should be generated for each sample. Samples can be collected and MPLExed in the tubes labeled for protein/ proteomics as the protein remains in the tube following removal of the aqueous (into a tube labeled metabolites) and organic (into a tube labeled lipids) phases (see Fig. 1).Aliquots of samples are removed and tested at this step to ensure all virus has been inactivated.At this point the sample is inactivated and separated into three distinct analytes and each of them can be handled in BSL1 conditions.BCA assay regent is compatible up to 3 M urea, so when the sample is in 8 M urea, appropriate dilution factors should be considered.The TMT Reagents are amine-reactive and modify lysine residues and the peptide N-termini. All amine-containing buffers and additives must be removed before digestion and labeling.Prior to beginning a study, determine acceptable values for a selected set of metrics for the QC standard to be used. This should be performed using a clean instrument and new analytical and trap columns. Example metrics to monitor for performance are number of unique peptides identified, average chromatographic peak width, and mass error. QC procedures for complex proteomics measurements are not always straightforward. Establish a baseline for the QC process before running samples.Always run a blank before and after QC standard runs.In general, an LC capable of delivering a flow rate of 250 \u03bcL/min with a pressure limit of 8000 psi or greater and a mass spectrometer with a mass resolution of 30k or higher is required for this method.The default charge state of 2 is used instead of 1 to ensure we don\u2019t miss the doubly charged lipids (e.g., cardiolipins and gangliosides) and the detection of single charged lipids by setting the default charge state to 2 is unaffected.\n",
