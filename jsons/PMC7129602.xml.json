As a logical target for molecular manipulation, the clotting protein offers hope for the development of newer treatment protocols for hepatitis patients. This research opens the way for initial thoughts of a hepatitis treatment by blocking a clotting protein and, if such inhibitors are generated that work in hepatitis patients, perhaps the same inhibitors have the potential to be used in the treatment of SARS.",
