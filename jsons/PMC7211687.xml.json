The propagation of HAI either occurs through parenteral or airborne transmission, in addition to hand contamination [3]. As such, insufficient disinfection of the medical equipment, lack of asepsis during intrusive interventions and hand contamination by the medical staff significantly increase the risk of HAI within healthcare facilities [3].",

Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is an important chemical disinfectant that is widely used in health care exhibiting a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity [7,8]. The biocidal effect of sodium hypochlorite varies depending on the microorganism. For example, 0.1% (1000 ppm) sodium hypochlorite significantly reduces human coronavirus and human parainfluenza virus infectivity on surfaces within 1 min exposure time while a solution of approximately 5000 ppm hypochlorite applied for 1 min produced a 99.9% reduction in hepatitis A virus. WHO recommends sodium hypochlorite at 0.5% or 5 g/L (equivalent to 5000 ppm) for disinfecting surfaces at health care settings and that a minimum residual chlorine concentration of 0.2 ppm is present in drinking water [1,9]. As such, promoting access to sodium hypochlorite in healthcare facilities can contribute to the improvement of sanitation and hygiene, thereby reducing the prevalence of HAI and generating savings [10].",

The compliance with the eleven essential hospital hygiene practices defined by the Ministry of Health and the regional health authority, which must be applied systematically to guarantee optimal hygiene in health care facilities, was evaluated by a series of questions and visual inspection on site (Appendix 1). Some health centers were evaluated on less than 11 essential practices because they do not perform childbirth and 3 practices are linked to it. Therefore, it is the % of implementation that was taken into account.2.Adaptability. To evaluate if WATA device technology is indeed adapted to the wide diversity of facilities the frequency of use, reliability (amount of production) and storage conditions of the sodium hypochlorite generated were evaluated. Questions like: Do you still need to buy/look for chlorine in the market? How often? Were applied in the supervision grid.3.Quality control of the production. The control of the chlorine concentration of the sodium hypochlorite produced with the electro-chlorinator devices was performed with the WataTest, a reagent that makes it possible to determine the concentration of active chlorine (Cl2, HOCL, OCL-) of any chlorinated solution, in grams per liter, in a range of 1\u20137 g/L (0.1\u20130.7% of active chlorine and 0.32\u20132.23 \u00b0 Cl) with an accuracy of \u00b10.5 g/L. The daily control of the production was performed by the WataTest but for the evaluation carried during supervisions the thiosulphate titration test was chosen to provide better accuracy.4.Cost-effectiveness. Evaluating the savings that can be incurred by using electro-chlorinator devices to produce a sufficient amount of sodium hypochlorite as opposed to purchasing chlorine tablets. WATA devices are guaranteed for 2 years by the manufacturer but have a much longer lifespan when used correctly (4\u20135 years easily). The main goal was, therefore, to evaluate if these devices are profitable before the end of their service life so that they can be replaced, if necessary, with the money saved by their use to obtain an economically sustainable system. The analysis took the production costs entailed by the WATA devices into account, namely energy, salt, water and supervision cost. The time dedicated to training was not included as training is also necessary when using chlorine tablets.\n",
