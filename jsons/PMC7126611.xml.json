            "text": "Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae, which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV). The families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae and Roniviridae make up the order Nidovirales. The arterivirus genome is a polycistronic, single-stranded RNA of positive polarity with a 5\u2032 type I cap (Sagripanti et al., 1986), and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tract (Brinton et al., 1986, Contag et al., 1986, Sagripanti, 1985, van Berlo et al., 1982). Arterivirus genomes range in length from 12.7 to 15.7 kb with SHFV being the longest (accession numbers: EAV, NC002532; LDV, NC002534; PRRSV, NC001961; SHFV, NC003092). The viral non-structural genes are encoded by ORF1a/ORF1b, located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome and are translated from the genomic RNA. The structural genes are encoded at the 3\u2032 end of the genome and are expressed from a nested set of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs that are generated by a discontinuous transcription process (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995, van Marle et al., 1999, Snijder and Meulenberg, 2001). The 5\u2032NCRs of the various arterivirus genomic and subgenomic RNAs range in length from 156 to 212 nts, while the 3\u2032NCRs vary from 62 to 150 nts. The lengths of the SHFV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032NCRs are 209 and 76 nts, respectively.",

For MHV, a bulged secondary structure located within the 3\u2032NCR adjacent to the nucleocapsid (N) gene stop codon was demonstrated to be required for viral replication (Hsue and Masters, 1997, Hsue et al., 2000). The 3\u2032 side of the bottom portion of this structure was subsequently shown to form a pseudoknot with another 3\u2032NCR SL located downstream (Goebel et al., 2004). These two structures were found to be mutually exclusive and could potentially function as a molecular switch during viral replication. In the bovine coronavirus (BCV) genome, a pseudoknot was also reported to form immediately downstream of a SL similar to the one reported in the MHV 3\u2032NCR and this tertiary interaction was required for coronavirus defective genome replication (Williams et al., 1999). For the arterivirus, PRRSV, a SL was predicted near the 5\u2032 end of ORF7 and some evidence suggested that nucleotides within the top loop of this structure formed a tertiary interaction (kissing interaction) with nucleotides in the top loop of a predicted SL in the 3\u2032NCR (Verheije et al., 2002).",

This hypothesis further suggests that the cell proteins involved would be ones that are evolutionarily conserved among different mammalian species. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that the host range of individual arteriviruses is restricted at the level of virus attachment and that a single productive replication cycle occurs after transfection of viral genomic RNA into cells from a non-permissive host (Inada et al., 1993, Meulenberg et al., 1998, Kreutz, 1998). To determine whether other arterivirus 3\u2032(+)NCR RNAs show cell protein binding patterns similar to that of the SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA, UV-induced cross-linking assays were performed with these RNAs. The initial assays were done with either 32P-labeled EAV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA or PRRSV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA and MA104 S100 extracts in the presence of 600 ng of non-specific competitor. Four proteins with similar molecular masses (85, 77, 56 and 42 kDa) were detected by the SHFV, EAV, and PRRSV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNAs (Fig. 1D). While the 85 kDa protein appeared to bind the EAV and PRRSV RNAs more efficiently than the SHFV RNA, the other three proteins appeared to bind all three of the viral 3\u2032RNAs with similar efficiency. When 1 \u03bcg of non-specific competitor was used, the 56 and 42 kDa proteins, but not the 85 and 77 kDa proteins, were detected (data not shown).

The presence or absence of the additional 3\u2032nucleotides did not change the Mfold-predicted secondary structure of the SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA. 3\u2032NCRpl RNA and primer P11, which was complementary to 3\u2032 nts \u221226 to \u221242 (Fig. 3B), were annealed. The 3\u2032NCRpl RNA was first partially digested with one of three single-strand specific ribonucleases and then subjected to reverse transcription. At least three experiments were performed with each RNase and each RNase was used at two or more concentrations. A representative gel for each RNase is shown in Fig. 3A. Undigested 3\u2032NCRpl RNA was sequenced as previously described (Nainan et al., 1991) (Fig. 3A, first four lanes). A summary of the data obtained is shown in Fig. 3B. Only strong intensity cleavage bands that were consistently observed in multiple experiments are indicated. All of these strong RNase cleavages were at nucleotides predicted to be single-stranded with only a couple of exceptions. RNase A cleaved nts U24, and U31. Although these nucleotides were predicted to be base-paired, each was located adjacent to a single stranded region which would increase its accessibility to single-strand specific RNase cleavage, especially during RNA structure \u201cbreathing\u201d. The same was true for nucleotides U15, U24, A29, U31, U41, U49, U53, U59 and G69, which were cleaved by RNase T2, and nts A29, A35 and U59, cleaved by RNase T1. Other exceptions (U8, A17, A30, G34, C42, U45, U55 and U70) were predicted to be double-stranded and were not directly adjacent to a loop or bulge, but were cleaved.

To gain a further understanding of the protein recognition elements in the SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR, a deletion/mutation strategy was used. Mutations were designed based on the structural information obtained so that they caused only local or minimal perturbations of the structure of the 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA. Mfold analyses were done to predict the effect of each mutation on the SL structure (Fig. 4A). In RNA-E, the top loop was mutated (5\u2032UCCCU3\u2032 was replaced by 5\u2032AAA3\u2032). Part of the large 3\u2032 internal loop sequence (nts 20\u201323, 5\u2032AACU3\u2032) was deleted in RNA-F. RNA-G contained a deletion of nts 23\u201326 and nts 44\u201348 (5\u2032ACUA3\u2032 and 5\u2032AUUAA3\u2032, respectively). This deletion was thermodynamically predicted to change the sequence of the top loop from 5\u2032UCCCU3\u2032 to 5\u2032CUA3\u2032, to change the bulge sequence in the top portion of the SL and to stabilize the stem below this bulge by removing the internal loop. UV-induced cross-linking assays indicated that RNA-E bound p56 much less efficiently than the wildtype 3\u2032NCR RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Reduced binding of p56 to RNA-F was also observed (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and p56 binding to RNA-G was further reduced (Fig. 4B, lane 5). p42 binding to the RNA-E and RNA-F but not to RNA-G was detected. These data suggest that both the top loop sequence and the sequence of the internal loop in the upper part of the stem are needed for efficient binding of p56. However, even with both of these sites eliminated, a low amount of residual p56 binding was detected.",

The RNA affinity column was prepared by covalently linking the SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA to an agarose-adipic acid hydrazide matrix (Blyn et al., 1996, Blyn et al., 1997). A mock column, that contained no RNA linked to the matrix, was also prepared. An S100 cytoplasmic extract prepared from MA104 cells was first incubated with a mixture of various non-specific competitor RNAs and then sequentially passed over an RNA affinity column three times. After washing the column, bound proteins were eluted, concentrated and exchanged into storage buffer as described in Section 2. Aliquots of the 0.2 M wash and 3 M eluate fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE and stained with GoldBlot (Fig. 5A). Two protein bands with estimated molecular masses of about 56 kDa and a single protein band of about 42 kDa were consistently detected in samples that also contained bands of the same sizes in UV-induced cross-linking assays (Fig. 5B). The protein purification protocol was repeated several times with similar results. The binding activity of p42 in the 3 M eluate was comparable to that of p56 (Fig. 5B, lane 3) even though the relative amount of p42 in the 3 M eluate was less than that of p56, as indicated by GoldBlot staining (Fig. 5A, lane 2), suggesting that naturally occurring competitors that affect the relative binding activity of p42 to the viral 3\u2032RNA in the unfractionated cell extract may have been eliminated during the purification process. No viral RNA binding activity was detected in the eluate from the mock column (data not shown).",

The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and selected peptides were sequenced by automated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a Thermo-Finnigan LCQ Classic quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Davis and Lee, 1997, Davis and Lee, 1998, Swiderek et al., 1998). Sequences were obtained for eight peptides derived from the top p56 band, for seven peptides from the bottom p56 band, and for eight peptides from p42 (Fig. 5C). The peptide sequences obtained from both of the p56 bands showed 100% identity with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein. Three isoforms of human PTB with predicted molecular masses of 59 kDa (PTB1/hnRNP I) (Gil et al., 1991), 57.2 kDa (PTB2) (Patton et al., 1991) and 42.8 kDa (PTB3) (Ghetti et al., 1992) are produced by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. PTB1 contains 26 additional amino acids and PTB2 contains 19 additional amino acids not present in PTB3. Since none of the peptides analyzed contained sequences that were unique to PTB1 or PTB2, the identity of the isoforms in the p56 doublet could not be confirmed. However, PTB1 and PTB2 are the closest in size to the two proteins that were purified. The sequences obtained from the p42 band showed 100% identity with fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase A. Three isoforms of aldolase (A, B and C) have been previously identified and are expressed from separate genes on three different chromosomes (16, 9 and 17, respectively). The three aldolase isoforms are identical in size and their sequences are highly conserved (70\u201382% identical) (Tolan et al., 1987).",

The RPCs formed were resolved by 10% non-denaturing-PAGE and detected by autoradiography (Fig. 7A and D). In reactions containing higher His-PTB concentrations, multiple RPCs were observed which was likely due to the aggregation of the complexes. Two complexes were observed at all concentrations of aldolase tested and may represent dimers and tetramers of this protein. Partial competition was observed when a 10-fold molar excess of the specific competitor was used with either recombinant His-PTB or aldolase. Complete competition was observed with an 18-fold molar excess of the specific competitor with recombinant His-PTB and with a 56-fold molar excess of the specific competitor with aldolase.

In these assays, a constant amount of 32P-labeled SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA and increasing amounts of either purified recombinant His-PTB (Fig. 7B) or aldolase (Fig. 7E) were used and the amount of RPCs that formed was quantified. The minimum amount of protein needed to observe an RNA mobility shift was determined in preliminary experiments. The lowest concentration of aldolase required was 24.8 nM, while that for His-PTB was 2.5 nM. Because the His-PTB used was not purified to homogeneity, the concentrations for this protein were estimates. The relative amounts of the RPCs and free probe were measured and the values obtained from at least three experiments were averaged. A theoretical saturation binding curve was generated by plotting the percent of bound SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA versus the concentration of either recombinant His-PTB (Fig. 7C) or aldolase (Fig. 7F). The entire free probe region and all of the RPC band regions were included in the calculations. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd) values were calculated as previously described (Lu et al., 1992, Weeks and Crother, 1992) using the equation: log (% bound/% unbound) = \nn {log[PTB or aldolase (nM)]} \u2013 log K\nd. The relative K\nd for the His-PTB-SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA interaction was estimated to be 7 nM, whereas the relative K\nd for the aldolase-viral RNA interaction was estimated to be 69 nM. The slope of the line in the inset graph for recombinant His-PTB was 1.24, indicating that approximately 1 His-PTB homodimer binds to one SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA molecule.

The binding of PTB to both the MHV 5\u2032(+)NCR RNA and 3\u2032(\u2212)NCR RNA were shown to be important for virus replication (Li et al., 1999). PTB binding to the MHV 3\u2032(\u2212)NCR RNA was reported to induce a conformational change in this RNA (Huang and Lai, 1999). Further support for an involvement of PTB in MHV RNA replication was provided by the observation that transcription but not translation of MHV DI RNA was inhibited in cells over-expressing a truncated form of PTB (Choi et al., 2002). Three regions within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome RNA, namely the 5\u2032NCR, a region in the capsid protein coding region, and the X region of the 3\u2032NCR, were reported to bind to PTB (Ali and Siddiqui, 1997, Ito and Lai, 1999, Tsuchinhara et al., 1997). Zhang et al. (2004) showed that HCV replication was down-regulated by expression of siRNA against PTB. RNA interference studies unfortunately do not provide information about the roles that cellular co-factors play in viral replication cycles. Also, silencing of some cell genes can cause secondary effects on the cell that suppress virus replication indirectly.",

Aldolase binds to the SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA with a lower affinity (K\nd\n = 69 nM) than PTB.

The EAV and PRRSV 3\u2032NCRs were shown to bind a 56 and 42 kDa MA104 cell protein in UV-induced cross-linking assays and specific competition was observed when they were used as competitors in a competition gel mobility shift assay with an SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA probe. Although not identical, the predicted secondary structures of other arterivirus 3\u2032NCR RNAs consist of a 3\u2032SL with internal loop or bulge regions along the stem. In each case, pyrimidines are present in the top loop of the 3\u2032SL and on the 3\u2032 side of the stem in an internal loop or bulge located near the top of the stem. RNA structure probing analyses have not yet been reported for any of the other arterivirus 3\u2032NCR RNAs.",

It is not yet known whether a similar tertiary interaction forms between the SL in the 3\u2032NCR and an upstream SL structure in the SHFV genomic RNA. Possible roles of PTB and aldolase binding to the arterivirus 3\u2032NCR RNA during the virus replication cycle are presently not known. The data reported here suggest that these two proteins could compete for an overlapping binding site and this competition may be functionally relevant.",
