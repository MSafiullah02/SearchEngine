Neurosurgery as a specialty has adopted these measures and has emitted 184 recommendations to properly classify and select patients requiring emergent treatment 185 during triage (whether COVID is non-suspected, suspected, denied, or confirmed) 11-15 . Our 186 results demonstrate the dramatic consequences that these measures have provoked in 187 neurosurgical practice, whether in the public or private, reaching rates as high as 80% in 188 most of the countries. This fact proves right the estimates of the ILO 10 , given that 17% of 189 neurosurgeons in public health care system are suffering a degree of unrefunded work (8% 190 partial reduction in salary, and 9% not receiving payment) as early as two elapsed months 191 since the starting of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin Iberoamerica on February 9 th , 192 2020 16 . 193 194 We are most concerned about the sustainability of medical practice in neurosurgery as for 195 that of many other specialties, having lesser percentages of essential-care.
