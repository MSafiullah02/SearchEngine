In influenza virus, hundreds of copies of the haemagglutinin (HA) fusion glycoprotein project from the virus surface. Despite intensive study of HA and its fusion activity, the protein's modus operandi in manipulating viral and target membranes to catalyse their fusion is poorly understood. Here, the three-dimensional architecture of influenza virus-liposome complexes at pH 5.5 was investigated by electron cryo-tomography. Tomographic reconstructions show that early stages of membrane remodeling take place in a target membrane-centric manner, progressing from punctate dimples, to the formation of a pinched liposomal funnel that may impinge on the apparently unperturbed viral envelope. The results suggest that the M1 matrix layer serves as an endoskeleton for the virus and a foundation for HA during membrane fusion. Fluorescence spectroscopy monitoring fusion between liposomes and virions shows that leakage of liposome contents takes place more rapidly than lipid mixing at pH 5.5. The relation of 'leaky' fusion to the observed prefusion structures is discussed.",

Despite intensive study, we have a limited mechanistic understanding of how fusion protein machinery manipulates lipid membranes to induce their fusion. The haemagglutinin (HA) envelope glycoprotein mediates influenza virus membrane fusion and hence has a key function in host cell invasion by this major human pathogen. It is the archetypal class-I fusion protein and shares core architectural elements with fusogens in retroviruses (e.g. HIV), filoviruses (e.g. ebola virus), coronaviruses (e.g. SARS virus), and paramyxoviruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus) (Hughson, 1997; Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007) .",

Activated proteins grab hold of the host membrane, and in concert with an energy-releasing conformational change, are able to draw the host (target) and viral membranes into apposition and induce them to fuse. To date, the organization of lipid and protein in the virus-target membrane complexes during fusion has eluded structural characterization. Numerous models of membrane deformation leading to fusion have been proposed (reviewed, for example, in Kozlov, 2003, 2008; Tamm et al, 2003; Martens and McMahon, 2008) . The majority of models describing HA-mediated membrane fusion focus on the properties of a hemifusion stalk in which the outer leaflets of the two previously distinct lipid bilayers have joined, the inner leaflets remain separate, and aqueous contents have not mixed. The existence of a hemifused state is supported by fluorescence and electrophysiology assays (reviewed in Kozlov, 2003, 2005) . The events leading up to and following the formation of the hemifusion stalk are less understood. It has been suggested that HA induces the formation of highly curved dimples in the target membrane to initiate the fusion process (Kuzmin et al, 2001; Efrat et al, 2007) . Alternatively, some have proposed that the fusion peptides act primarily on the viral membrane, generating local bending and protrusions directed towards the target membrane (Kozlov and Chernomordik, 1998) . Computational simulations have yet to resolve pre-stalk fusion intermediates including dimples. In the absence of structural characterization, our understanding of the mechanisms of membrane fusion is likely to remain nebulous.",

            "text": "Despite significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanics of protein-mediated membrane fusion, much is known about the fusion proteins themselves (Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Eckert and Kim, 2001) . Influenza HA is expressed as a single precursor polypeptide called HA0. Each 225 kDa HA spike is a homotrimer of HA0 subunits. Host proteases cleave the HA0 into two disulfide-bonded subunits, HA1 and HA2 (reviewed in Steinhauer, 1999) . Cleavage is necessary for rendering HA fusion capable and thus for infectivity (Klenk et al, 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) . HA1 contains the sialic acid receptor-binding site as well as the majority of antigenic features for influenza, whereas HA2 carries out membrane fusion. HA is bound to the viral envelope by a transmembrane anchor on the C-terminal tail of HA2; the N-terminus of HA2 generated by proteolysis of HA0 is the fusion peptide itself. Between 300 and 500 trimeric, HA spikes are arrayed on the surface of each virus (Inglis et al, 1976; Ruigrok et al, 1984; Harris et al, 2006) . After attachment to the cell surface, influenza virus enters the cell by endocytosis (Figure 1 ). Endosomal maturation and the resulting decrease in endocytic pH trigger a multi-step,'spring-loaded' conformational change of HA to an extended coiled-coil conformation that grapples the viral and target membranes together and induces them to fuse (Skehel et al, 1982; Carr and Kim, 1993; Gruenke et al, 2002) . X-ray crystal structures of influenza HA have elucidated the protein machinery's detailed structure in the neutral pH and postfusion conformations, and in the precursor HA0 form (Wilson et al, 1981; Bullough et al, 1994; Chen et al, 1998) . Fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes takes place optimally at pH 5 in late endosomes (Maeda and Ohnishi, 1980; Matlin et al, 1981; White et al, 1982; Puri et al, 1990; Krumbiegel et al, 1994; Korte et al, 1999; Lakadamyali et al, 2003) ; however, prefusion intermediates are populated at the pH values between 5.5 and 6.0 found in early and maturing endosomes (Doms et al, 1985; White and Wilson, 1987; Stegmann et al, 1990; Korte et al, 1999) .",

These have provided a glimpse of the virus's detailed construction, the general nature of changes exhibited by the virus in response to fusion activation, and its trafficking into cells. This study is the first, however, to provide a detailed three-dimensional characterization of fusion intermediates in this intensively studied system. Here, electron cryo-tomography (ECT) was used to image the three-dimensional architecture of loci formed between authentic X31 influenza virions and liposomal membranes under fusogenic conditions. Flash freezing of unstained biological specimens enables transient intermediates to be trapped, and the organization of protein and membranes in fusion intermediates to be determined. ECT builds a three-dimensional image of unfixed biological structures preserved in vitreous ice by imaging the specimen over a range of axial angular tilts (Lucic et al, 2005) . Conditions were chosen to recreate the fusogenic interactions between virus and target membrane that are present at the early and maturing endosomal stage of cell invasion (pHB5.5-6.0), with the goal of imaging nascent fusion loci at the earliest stages of membrane remodeling. In parallel with the ECT studies, time-resolved fluorescence measurements at pH 5.5 and 5.0 were performed to validate that the liposomes are a reasonable facsimile of a target membrane and verify that the virions were capable of fusing with the liposomes. Figure 1 Influenza A virus, an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus, enters cells by endocytosis. Endocytic maturation exposes the virus to stages of acidification. Fusion of viral and endosomal membranes occurs most rapidly at pH 5; however, studies have shown that the HA fusion protein becomes active at pH 5.5-6 to begin the process of membrane remodeling that ultimately leads to fusion.",

When the doubly labeled liposomes were mixed with unlabeled virus particles at acidic pH, dequenching of both SRB and DiD fluorescence was observed (Figure 2 ). At pH 5.5 DiD dequenching was a slow process, reaching only 9% after 60 min. Interestingly, SRB fluorescence dequenching took place significantly more rapidly compared with DiD fluorescence changes and reached 30% by 60 min. When the pH of the reaction was 5.0, changes in the two signals were nearly concomitant, and DiD dequenching was also more complete than at pH 5.5 reaching 17% by 60 min post-acidification.",

            "text": "The dequenching observed for SRB fluorescence was significantly larger in magnitude than dequenching of the lipidic dye. A reasonable explanation for this is that though some of the dequenching signal may be due to transfer of some SRB to the viral lumen, additional dye leaks out of the liposomes and diffuses into the entire volume of the cuvette. This appears to precede lipid mixing. By contrast, as lipid mixing takes place between virus and liposome, the two-dimensional surface area coverage of DiD only increases modestly (B50%) as B150 nm virus envelopes fuse with membrane of the 100 nm liposomes, leading to a relatively small dequenching signal. Fluorescence experiments were carried out with an excess of liposomes to disfavour disruption of liposomes by multiple virus particles. As a result, the total extent of dequenching of the dyes did not reach 100% (as determined by complete dequenching in the presence of 0.1% TritonX-100) over the time frame examined. No qualitatively different fluorescence kinetics was observed when the amount of DiD incorporated in the DOPC membrane was varied by a factor of 4. A complementary set of experiments were performed in which the DiD fluorophore was incorporated into the virus membrane, and liposomes contained only encapsulated SRB (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The changes and pH effects closely paralleled the changes observed when the lipophilic DiD dye was in the liposomal bilayer. These data confirm that DOPC liposomes and viruses are capable of merging their membranes, which occurs more efficiently at pH 5.0, and the HA-mediated process is 'leaky'.",

As in a previous ECT study of influenza virus ultrastructure, the HA and neuraminidase surface glycoproteins can often be distinguished (Harris et al, 2006) . In most virions a thick (B8-12 nm) lipoprotein envelope lies beneath the glycoprotein coat and encapsulates the virus's ribonucleoprotein material (the individual segments are unresolved). The envelope's braided appearance results from the compositional mixture of phospholipids, cholesterol, transmembrane protein anchors, M2 ion channels, and associated M1 matrix proteins. Three distinct layers of the envelope can be discerned in volume slices through many of the viruses (Supplementary Figure S2 ). The two outermost layers exhibit B4-6 nm separation, whereas the inner layer, presumably matrix protein, is B4-6 nm further below the central layer. Fujiyoshi et al (1994) have proposed that the inner portion of the envelope reflects a matrix protein-lipid composite, rather than a classical phospholipid bilayer leaflet with associated protein. Further study is required to elucidate the detailed construction and stratification of the envelope; however, for the purpose of this study, virus particles that exhibit thick Density that extends beneath some glycoprotein spikes and bores completely through the virus envelope to the matrix layer may correspond to the glycoproteins' transmembrane anchors ( Figure 3A) . A direct association between glycoprotein anchors and matrix protein is consistent with previous reports that have described the importance of this interaction for virus morphology (Enami and Enami, 1996; Jin et al, 1997; Ali et al, 2000) . The leaflets of the DOPC liposomes tend to be difficult to resolve under the imaging conditions, although in some tomograms, two leaflets with B4 nm spacing are evident (Supplementary Figure S2 ).",

Identification of relative concentrations of virus and liposome that produce significant numbers of discrete pairings of the particle types and also vitreous ice suitable for low-dose ECT has been a challenge. The majority (n4100) of virions in the ECT specimens for this study were not participating in complexes. Of the 53 loci observed between virions and liposomes at pH 5.5, nine exhibited dimple-like features on the target membranes without apparent disruption of the liposomal bilayer density ( Figure 4 ). 23 exhibited a funnel-shaped deformation of the target liposomal membrane with what appears to be a break in the target membrane ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Two instances of intermediates further along the pathway were observed ( Figure 7) , the low count number being consistent with the relatively low efficiency of lipid mixing and fusion at pH 5.5 ( Figure 2 ). The features are described further below. The remainder of contacts involved various types of flat contacts in which the target membrane runs parallel to the outer viral envelope and otherwise does not exhibit any detectable deformation. In some cases, these appear to be mediated by HA ( Figure 4D ), in others, the virus and liposome may simply have been brought into contact because of surface tension effects in the thin water film that spans the 2 mm grid hole. A limited number of putative post-fusion complexes were observed (Supplementary Figure S3 ), again consistent with the relatively low efficiency of lipid mixing and fusion at pH 5.5. These complexes tend to be large, on the order of 200-250 nm in diameter; they exhibit granular contents that are localized on primarily one side of the vesicle near concentrations of glycoprotein spikes; other regions on the vesicle surface are bare, with low density of associated spikes.",

Samples had been acidified at pH 5.5 for 5-8 min. Microscope defocus was set at 3-5 mm; 5.3 nm-thick slices through reconstructed cryo-tomographic density are shown. Scalebars 50 nm. (A) At early stages of docking, the liposomal bilayer is pulled into B5 nm-wide dimples (black arrowheads). (B) Some liposomes make glancing contacts (arrowhead in slice 3) with the viral envelope. (C) Liposomes can form extended planar contacts with virus envelope. (D) The liposome in this complex is engaged by two virions, one above and one to the left hand side. The liposome in this case forms a nearly planar contact with the virus on the left and appears to be coordinated by HA. The boxed HA spike in slices 2 and 3 exhibits density in a 'Y' shape bridging the virus surface and liposome. This resembles features seen at virus membrane junctions in HSV-1 entry studies (Maurer et al, 2008) . The interaction with the upper virus is more localized, with the liposomal membrane being pinched into an acute angle (arrowhead, slice 1). The virus has grabbed hold of a liposome and drawn its membrane towards the viral envelope. A putative opening at the funnel's mouth is indicated by the white arrowheads in slice 1. The viral envelope appears to be intact; 5.3 nm-thick serial sections are shown. Samples have been acidified to pH 5.5 for 5 min; 50 nm scalebar. (B) A cross-sectional density plot (path indicated by black arrowheads in (A), slice 1) maps the B5 nm-wide channel through the lipid funnel. The channel is lined by the liposomal bilayer with 3-4 nm leaflet spacings. (C) A 10 nm-thick volume section shows density that is interpreted to be HA spikes in a 'Y' shaped conformation (white arrowheads) coordinating the liposomal funnel. Density rendered using Chimera. Inset shows a schematic of the key density features. state in which the target membrane has been drawn and pinched towards the viral envelope such that it is in close apposition to the envelope's face (Figures 5 and 6 ; Supplementary Movies 2 and 3). Nearly all such funnelshaped target membrane structures show an apparent lack of density, B5 nm wide, at the point of closest approach to the virus particle, suggesting that the liposome may present an open mouth towards the virus envelope. The proximal virus membrane by comparison does not appear to exhibit similar breaks or deformations. Given the limitations in ECT resolution, partial information because of the missing wedge effect, as well as the potential for weak density to be obscured by contrast transfer function (CTF) artefacts (seen as white Fresnel fringes) around liposomal bilayers, one cannot definitively rule out the possibility that tenuous connectivity with the viral envelope has been established or that membrane in some non-bilayer form may be present in the funnel mouth. The putative membrane breaches are observed not only at higher microscope defocus settings (e.g. 5 mm in Figure 5B ), but also closer to true focus as well (3 mm in Figure 6 ) where fringing is less pronounced and where individual liposomal leaflets (still associated as a bilayer) can be observed lining the channel through the liposome's pinched neck (see Figure 6A slice 1, and Figure 6B ). An open-mouthed funnel would be consistent with observations of significant leakage of liposomal contents before lipid mixing. Once a hemifused state is reached, the joining of target membrane and viral lipids into a continuous barrier would inhibit further leakage of contents from the liposomal lumen.",

In this case, within resolution limitations, the liposomal membrane appears to exhibit density continuity with the viral envelope (particularly evident in slices 4-6), however the lipids may not have mixed extensively. Specifically, the high contrast DOPC liposomal membrane exhibits an abrupt boundary at the base of the neck. Previous studies of HA-mediated fusion have indicated that at early stages of membrane fusion, lipid transfer may be restrained (Zimmerberg et al, 1994; Chernomordik et al, 1998) . The tomogram is not sharp enough to distinguish individual membrane leaflets, thus it is not possible to discern whether the complex exists as hemifused stalk-like structure or possibly as a constrained pore with joined lumens. Future efforts will seek to increase the acuity of the reconstructed density to clarify membrane leaflet continuity by working closer to focus, at higher magnifications, and by applying recently developed liposome marked with 'L' and virus with 'F' in slice 1. A neck with 10-15 nm-wide mouth is seen in slices 4-6. Liposomal membrane and viral envelope density appear continuous, although the strong liposomal density exhibits a pronounced boundary at the base of the neck. Sample acidified for 8 min. Microscope defocus 5 mm. Scalebar 50 nm. (B) In the 10.6 nm-thick section through another complex, an B15 nm-wide neck connects a virion and liposome. Sample acidified for 5 min. Microscope defocus 3 mm. Scalebar 50 nm. (C) A density plot along the channel axis (path indicated by black arrowheads in (B)) indicates that three ridges of density traverse the central section of the neck. The density may be due to an intact matrix layer or liposome and virus membrane leaflets. (D) Low-dose cryo-EM image of influenza X31 virions at pH 5.0 in the absence of liposomes suggests that the viral envelopes are more labile at pH 5.0 and give rise to envelope-derived lipidic vesicles (marked 'V'); no comparable vesicles were observed in identical samples that were kept at pH 7.5. Two virions (marked 'F') seen fusing with a vesicle in the lower left quadrant appear to be undergoing expansive pore dilation; an alternative explanation for this feature is that the virions may be caught in the process of shedding or blebbing their membranes.

This may result from an essential stabilization conferred by the intact matrix layer to the viral membrane. An intact matrix protein layer may also constrain the transition to an open fusion pore and its expansion. The complex shown in Figure 7B shows a liposome-virus complex in which, based on the continuous curvature of the perimeter of the two particles, the membranes appear to have joined to some degree. A neck with a B15 nm-wide inner diameter links the virion and liposome. As in the complex shown in Figure 7A , the high-density liposomal bilayer exhibits an abrupt boundary midway along the neck suggesting that lipid exchange was not complete (white arrowhead). Three peaks of density arranged in roughly parallel striations across the neck are observed ( Figure 7B and C). The density within the neck may be membrane leaflets or viral contents such as the matrix layer, which is intact as evidenced by the thick envelope around the virus's periphery. This type of laterstage fusion complex will be investigated more fully when conditions have been identified that enrich the population of this intermediate.",

Preliminary studies of X31 influenza virions in the absence of liposomes at pH 5.0 have yielded three notable features ( Figure 7D ): (1) the thick viral envelopes are less prevalent, having apparently reverted in large part to a standard bilayer; (2) unilamellar vesicles that are not observed in neutral virus samples from the identical preparation are abundant, possibly reflecting that significant amounts of lipid can be stripped from virions at pH 5.0; (3) a few instances of virions fusing with the virus-derived vesicles are observed and fusion pores are dilated and expansive in contrast to the tight connections observed at pH 5.5 (alternatively, this may reflect a virion in the process of shedding its membrane).",

Matrixless particles present a similar surface density of glycoprotein spikes to matrix-bearing particles, however they tend to be spherical rather than capsular. This suggests that in the absence of matrix, particles adopt the lower energy, isotropic shape. The envelope layer in reconstructed tomograms of these particles at pH 5.5 is similar in simplicity to the DOPC bilayers. In contrast to the robust, matrix-bearing virions, the matrixless virus and liposomes deform symmetrically around the point of contact (Figure 8 ).",

A number of studies have inferred that HA spikes form functional aggregates at the onset of fusion (Ellens et al, 1990; Clague et al, 1991; Blumenthal et al, 1996; Danieli et al, 1996; Mittal et al, 2002) .

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the dominant component of the proximal endosomal membrane leaflet. The distal endosomal leaflet is likely to be enriched in phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine that have different curvature and fusion propensities. Understanding the role that intrinsic curvature of these lipids has in fusion is critical. It is likely, for example, that some of the membrane remodeling observed in this study resulted from the curvature-neutral PC bilayer reorganizing under HA's influence to relieve strain present in the curved, B100 nm liposome. Future studies will examine HA-mediated fusion with target membranes that more closely mimic the complex conditions found in endosomes.",

Such schemes would likely lead to disruption of the protective viral envelope before the formation of a productive fusion pore because of the destabilizing effect of the fusion peptides.

Bonnafous and Stegmann (2000) proposed a model in which the target membrane is punctured before mixing of viral and target membrane lipids. The observation of prefusion loci with apparent membrane breaks at the HA-contact zone is consistent with their proposed model. A 5 nm-wide conduit is also consistent in dimension with hypothesized pore diameters (4 nm) from patch clamp measurements of individual fusion events between HA-expressing fibroblasts and erythrocytes (Spruce et al, 1989) , although in the present case continuity between the viral and liposomal lumens has yet to be established. The narrow phospholipid funnel induced in the target membrane would minimize the area of contact between membranes that ordinarily resist apposition because of electrostatic repulsion and hydration effects (Cowley et al, 1978) . The tight curvature of the funnel neck may also facilitate the next stages of fusion after insertion of this tube into the viral envelope. Several studies have highlighted the importance of highly curved membranes during fusion (Lentz et al, 2000; Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003) . The fine structure of the funnel at its virus-proximal site cannot be resolved in the tomograms given the ECT resolution, however, one possibility envisages a mouth opening ringed by fusion peptides from multiple spikes that are embedded in a micellar cap or similar non-bilayer structure. Interestingly, such a configuration could potentially lead to lipid mixing between the inner and outer leaflets of the target membrane before mixing with lipids in the virus membrane.",

The matrix layer maintains the integrity and shape of the influenza virus, acting in essence like an endoskeleton, while also providing a foundation and anchor point for the HA fusion machinery. As a result, the fusion protein's membrane bending and remodeling actions appear to be concentrated on the target membrane. As a corollary to the buttressing role played by matrix at pH 5.5, it is plausible that dissolution of the matrix layer follows at late endosomal or lysosomal pHo5, loosening the restraints on the viral envelope and enabling it to complete the fusion process. As pH drops, the protonation state of the phosphate head groups and/or matrix protein may change, altering the protein's electrostatic interaction with the inner leaflet and stabilization of the envelope as a whole (Ruigrok et al, 2000) . Indeed, the fluorescence results and preliminary cryo-EM images of X31 virions at pH 5.0 suggest that the viral envelope may be more labile and predisposed to fuse at pH 5.0 than at pH 5.5, possibly because of dissolution or weakening of the M1 matrix layer ( Figure 7D) .",

Interestingly, in the only other case of a viral fusion intermediate imaged by ECT, the envelope of HSV-1 and target cellular membrane appears to exhibit symmetrical deformation during fusion, similar to what is observed for matrixless influenza virions (Maurer et al, 2008) .

These viruses also possess matrix proteins that have a critical role in virion morphogenesis during budding from host cells. Some of the matrix proteins, such as that from HIV, may be homologous to the influenza M1 protein (Harris et al, 1999) . Immature HIV particles exhibit a wellordered albeit partial matrix layer (Wright et al, 2007; Briggs et al, 2009 ); a distinct matrix layer is not readily apparent in electron cryo-tomograms of mature virions, although it is inferred that matrix may connect envelope and capsid (Briggs et al, 2003 (Briggs et al, , 2006 . Interaction of the Env protein's cytoplasmic domain and matrix protein in HIV-1 has been shown (Yu et al, 1992; Cosson, 1996) , thus it is conceivable that matrix may serve as an anchor for the Env protein and support the viral envelope during membrane fusion.

The reaction solution was passed over a PD-10 column equilibrated with 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. A single blue band containing the DiD-labeled virions was collected and stored at 41C.",

The combined solution was then mixed with a pH 5.0 citric acid solution to produce a final pH of 5.5. Samples were incubated at 251C. At 2.5, 5, 6.25, 8, and 15 min after acidification, 3 ml of the acidified mixture was transferred onto plasma-cleaned, C-flat holey carbon grids (Protochips Inc.), manually blotted, and plunge frozen in liquid ethane. The samples that had been acidified for longer periods tended to produce less optimal specimens for low-dose imaging apparently because of aggregation of liposomes and virions.",

            "text": "Cryo-EM and tomography processing EM was conducted at the National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy (NRAMM). Tilt series were gathered using an FEI Company T12 cryo-EM operating at 120 kV. A 2K \u00c2 2K TVIPS F224 CCD camera with 24 mm pixel size was used for imaging. Image magnification was set to \u00c2 26 000, which gave rise to 0.525 nm/pixel sampling. Nominal microscope defocus values of 3 and 5 mm were used; the first node of the microscope's CTF is at 3.1 and 3.9 nm for the two defocus values, respectively. Total electron dose for the entire tilt series was estimated B100 electrons/\u00c5 2 ; under these imaging conditions no bubbling was observed. Tilt series data collection was controlled by the Leginon software package with images gathered at 21 increments from \u00c058 to \u00fe 581 (Suloway et al, 2009 ). Tomograms were reconstructed using the weighted back-projection method implemented in IMOD (Kremer et al, 1996) . The tomograms were then filtered using one iteration of a three-dimensional median filter followed by a realspace Gaussian filter, width 1.5s. This process appears to preserve fine features reasonably well while reducing the amplitude of noise relative to the specimen density. Representative unfiltered and filtered images are shown in Supplementary Figure S5 . Images were visualized either in ImageJ (Abramoff et al, 2004) or Chimera (Pettersen et al, 2004) . Some particle tomograms appear sharper than others largely because of the different defocus settings, but also because of a combination of proximity in the field of view relative to the tilt axis, more stable cryo-stage performance during tilt series collection, more accurate true focus and eucentric height determination, thinner ice, and better alignment during image reconstruction.",
