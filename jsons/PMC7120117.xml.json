Prompt investigation and proper response to major disease outbreaks by a team of field epidemiologists can minimize negative impacts on the health and economies of affected populations. Outbreak investigation is commonly recognized as an important function of field epidemiologists who work in a variety of field settings in different countries. Outbreaks of communicable and non-communicable diseases can occur in various settings ranging from a big city or rural town to a sophisticated healthcare facility (Ungchusak and Iamsirithaworn 2009). During outbreak events, field epidemiologists work closely with health professionals from different disciplines to gather relevant information from patients, family members, close contacts and residents of the affected area. Common challenges to field epidemiologists include working with data sources that are incomplete and using investigation protocols that are not well planned (Goodman and Buehler 2008). The nature of the work of field epidemiologists demands a timely response and travel to the field site which can sometimes require difficult access to remote areas, in order to solve the problem. The extent of the investigation is often limited because of the need for timely intervention as well as situational constraints on study methods.",

The primary function of field epidemiologists is to use findings obtained from an investigation to define the disease etiology, to identify the possible source(s) of an outbreak, and risk factors in order to contain its spread, and to implement prevention and control measures. Key objectives of the investigation generally include creating a case definition, implementing methods for case-finding, and establishing the occurrence of cases by time, place, and attributes of the affected population including, gender and age. The data generated are used to formulate hypotheses regarding etiology, mode of transmission, and other key facets of the disease. An important aspect of the investigation is the collection of samples from patients, the environment, and other sources for diagnostic tests and other laboratory investigations. An investigation of a foodborne Streptococcal suis outbreak attributable to consumption of fresh pig blood is an example of field epidemiologists identifying an implicated food item in this zoonotic disease outbreak (Khadthasrima et al 2008). The associated epidemic curve shows a pattern of common point source outbreak following a funeral banquet in Thailand in 2007 (Fig. 9.1). Roughly 75 % of recently emerging diseases and 60 % of human pathogens are zoonoses, outbreak response required coordinated and field investigations (U.S. CDC 2013). Therefore harmonized, yet adapted approaches for field investigation are essential components of a holistic approach to understand, prevent and control zoonoses in a comprehensive manner.\n",

The program has trained nearly 3,000 professionals in this discipline and assisted other nations to establish a number of field-based training programs.

As a second component of the residency training, physicians pursue a Master\u2019s of Public Health (MPH) degree in universities of their choice. This 1-year graduate degree provides broad knowledge for working in public health.

Trainees learn how to conduct an outbreak investigation starting from verifying its existence, then organizing and traveling to the field to collect, manage and analyze data and interpret the findings in order to provide relevant recommendations. Most FETP curricula are designed for 2-year training though some are shorter (6 months to 1 year) and are referred to as field epidemiology training (FET). Trainees learn basic concepts of epidemiology and biostatistics and how to conduct field surveys and surveillance. In addition they also develop basic skills related to laboratory diagnosis, communication and outbreak management.
