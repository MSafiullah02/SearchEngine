Authors retrospectively analyzed data from 34 patients undergoing elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19, reporting that nearly 45% of patients needed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgery, while mortality rate was 20.5%. Notably, both admission to ICU and mortality rates were significantly higher as compared to previous reports [2] . Authors conclude that surgery may accelerate and worsen COVID-19 disease progression.",

We truly believe that a comparison with comorbid-and age-matched, COVID-19 negative control group might have strengthened the reliability of reported results. Indeed, as it stands, the paper is basically a case series and lacks of any information on which policy was followed and which triage performed to select patients for surgery. Probably no triage at all was done, and obviously such a condition is no more accepted anywhere.",
