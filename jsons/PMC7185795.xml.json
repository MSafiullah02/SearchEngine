The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia [1], [2], [3], [4]. As of 25 February 2020, at least 77 785 cases and 2666 deaths had been identified across China [5] and in other countries; in particular, 977 and 861 cases were identified in South Korea and Japan, respectively. The outbreak has already caused global alarm. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and issued advice in the form of temporary recommendations under the International Health Regulations (IHR).",

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh reported human-infecting member of the family Coronaviridae, which also includes SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. It has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. Both the clinical and the epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality. About 16%\u201321% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill, with a 2%\u20133% mortality rate [1], [4]. However, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to identify effective antiviral agents to combat the disease and explore the clinical effect of antiviral drugs.",

Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon (IFN), Favipiravir (FPV), and Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV), have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial. It has recently been demonstrated that, as a prodrug, FPV (half maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 61.88 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121, half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) > 400 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121, selectivity index (SI) > 6.46) effectively inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) [7]. Furthermore, other reports show that FPV is effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121\n[8]. Therefore, clinical studies are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this antiviral nucleoside for COVID-19 treatment.",

            "text": "The efficacy of the treatment was assessed by the time of viral clearance and the improvement rate of chest computed tomography (CT) scans on Day 14 after treatment. Chest CT scans were conducted on Days 4, 9, and 14 after treatment, with a fluctuate of 2 d. The CT findings were graded and scored using the method described previously [9], [10] by two medical diagnostic radiographers who were blind to grouping. The CT findings were graded on a three-point scale: 1 as normal attenuation, 2 as ground-glass attenuation, and 3 as consolidation. Each lung zone\u2014with a total of six lung zones in each patient\u2014was assigned a score on the following scale, according to the distribution of the affected lung parenchyma, using a method modified from a previously described protocol [10]: 0 as normal, 1 as 25% abnormality, 2 as 25%\u201350% abnormality, 3 as 50%\u201375% abnormality, and 4 as 75% abnormality. The four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above. Points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score, with a value ranging from 0 to 72 (Fig. 1\n). A change of \u201cImprove\u201d in the chest CT was defined as the total cumulative score being lower than before medication; a change of \u201cWorse\u201d was defined as the total cumulative score being higher than before medication; and a change of \u201cConstant\u201d was defined as the total cumulative score being the same as before treatment (Fig. 1).",

Furthermore, in the context of rumors and distrust of hospital isolation, using a randomized design at the outset might have led even more patients to refuse being isolated. Therefore, we chose to conduct a nonrandomized trial, in which patients consecutively admitted to the hospital during two separate periods were included in two groups, respectively.

This finding suggests that improvement of the disease may depend on inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2, and that FPV controls the disease progression of COVID-19 by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2. Until recently, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 had not been well clarified. Since the infection of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to be self-limited and characterized by systemic inflammation reaction, symptomatic and supportive treatment was mainly recommended by the WHO and the National Health Commission of the PRC. This description is similar to MERS-CoV, for which nonspecific therapeutic interventions are often introduced to prevent severe morbidity and mortality [16]. How antivirals would contribute to control of the disease is controversial. Although there have been many registered clinical trials focusing on antiviral drugs for COVID-19, the timing, duration of treatment, and study endpoints have not been unified. In the current study, the time of viral clearance was introduced as a primary endpoint to evaluate the antiviral effect of FPV on the SARS-CoV-2 and successfully identify the priority of FPV. The relationship between the time of viral clearance and the improvement in CT image indicates that viral clearance is an ideal surrogate for the clinical endpoint. A limitation of the present study was that the relationship between the viral titer and the clinical prognosis was not well clarified. Future research could pay more attention to this point.",

The task at hand was to run a well-designed trial to identify effective treatments based on a high level of evidence. However, at the beginning of this study, certain conditions did not allow the randomization of patients to receive either standard care or an experimental drug. In this pilot study of a non-randomized control trial, we found that FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we introduced the time of viral clearance as a primary endpoint for experimental antiviral treatment and demonstrated it to be a surrogate of clinical endpoint; this will be helpful for designing COVID-19 research.",
