In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank. We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25 th , 2019. These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus. Moreover, our study describes the same population genetic dynamic underlying the SARS 2003 epidemic, and suggests the urgent need for the development of effective molecular surveillance strategies of Betacoronavirus among animals and Rhinolophus of the bat family.",

In order to investigate the temporal signal, we regressed root-to-tip genetic distances from this ML tree against sample collection dates using TempEst v 1.5.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk) [10] . The ML phylogeny was used as a starting tree for Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using BEAST 1.10.4 (http://beast. community/index.html) [11] . We employed a stringent model selection analysis using both path-sampling (PS) and stepping stone (SS) procedures to estimate the most appropriate molecular clock model for the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis [12] . We tested a) the strict molecular clock model, which assumes a single rate across all phylogeny branches, and b) the more flexible uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal rate distribution (UCLN) [13] . Both SS and PS estimators indicated the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock (Bayes Factor = 4.3) as the best fitted model to the dataset under analysis. Besides, we have used the he HKY+G4 codon partitioned (CP)1 + 2,3 substitution model and the Bayesian Skyline coalescent model of population size and growth [14] . We computed MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) duplicate runs of 100 million states each, sampling every 10,000 steps. Convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer v.1.7.1 [14] . Proper mixing of the MCMC was checked for ESS values >200 for each estimated parameter using Tracer 1.7. Systematic Biology. 2018;67(5):-901-4). A Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) trees was obtained from the tree posterior distribution using TreeAnnotator (http://beast.community/index.html) after 10% burn-in.",

Molecular clock calibration estimated the evolutionary rate of the 2019-nCoV whole genome sequences at 6.58 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions site per year (95% HPD 5.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 -8.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). Figure  S1 ), which may suggest a relatively extended period of sub-epidemic circulation before the most recent events. The first evidence of 2019-nCoV dissemination appears to be, according to our phylogeographic reconstruction, from Wuhan, China, to Nonthamburi, Thailand, with an spp. of 0.96, followed by the emergence of two distinct lineages, one with further spreading in Nonthamburi, and the second one following a more complex pattern: from Nonthamburi to Zhejiang, Huangzhou (spp = 0.47), as well as from Zhejiang to Kanagawa, Kanto (spp = 0.62) and from Nonthamburi to Guandong, Zhuhai (spp = 0.45). The first reported US cases, in Chicago, Illinois and Seattle, Washington, appeared to be linked to Guandong, Zhuhai isolates, in agreement with reports of patients traveling back from that region of China before being diagnosed. Finally, our analysis identified the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus as the most probable origin of the 2019-nCoV (spp = 0.99).",

The substantial degree of genetic heterogeneity (15%) accumulated among human isolates during the past few months of the ongoing epidemic outbreak is not necessarily surprising for an RNA virus that has been shown to be a measurably evolving population over short time spans [15] . However, our findings underscore the urgent need for further molecular surveillance and the development of appropriate and an in-depth monitoring system capable of investigating viral mutation and transmission capabilities as 2019-nCoV unfortunately keeps spreading at a regional and potential global level. In other words, given the virus's fast evolutionary rate and population dynamic, tracking the emergence of novel transmission routes and/or patterns should be considered a significant priority.",

(https://www.biorxiv.org/) suggesting that a Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequence is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019-nCoV than other Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequences, but very distant from sequences isolated in SARS 202/2003 epidemic and MERS coronavirus. The finding may imply a most recent common ancestor between 2019-nCoV and the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. We also identify, in agreement with epidemiological reports, the city of Wuhan as the most likely origin of the human epidemic, dating back to the end of November 2019. In 2010, a previous article has suggested that the emergence of diverse virus strains within a few decades, in the different Rhinolophus species, may be the result of rapid evolution generating variants with the ability of easily crossing species barriers. The same study has shown that the epizootic transmission of the SARS from bat to human during the 2003 epidemic may have actually occurred up to 8 years earlier than the actual human outbreak [16] . Moreover, the migration map of the Rhinolophus bats in China involves almost the same geographic areas of the 2019-nCoV epidemic (http://www.bio.bris.ac.uk/ research/bats/China%20bats/rhinolophussinicus.htm). Taken together, these results indicate a recurring pattern among the sub-genre of the Betacoronavirus leading to periodical epizootic epidemics.",
