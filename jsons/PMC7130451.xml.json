The \u2018lockdowners\u2019 argue for tighter restrictions, succinctly summarised by New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s instructions to \u201cact like you have COVID-19\u201d [2] or more formally defined as mandatory mass quarantine. The lockdowners\u2019 argument is that reducing the duration of the crisis period will reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and decrease the period of disruption to the economy.",

As Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has highlighted, it is also important to consider the potential adverse effects of lockdown on the well-being of the population, which may include psychological effects and physical effects, e.g. from reduced access to health care and increased domestic violence\u2014the isolation effects [3].",

The simple analysis presented in this editorial could be extended to represent differences in the expected magnitudes of the economic and isolation effects in different scenarios, but the implied policy option of the presented decision analysis seems quite clear. The scenarios tested suggest that a decision to maintain a gradual steps approach implies governments are willing to trade-off increased numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths for reduced economic and isolation effects. More importantly, it implies governments are highly confident that a mandatory lockdown will not be required at a later date AND that a longer but less intense period of social distancing is highly likely to reduce the economic and isolation effects of the crisis AND that a more equitable distribution of the effects of the crisis is not a significant policy objective.",
