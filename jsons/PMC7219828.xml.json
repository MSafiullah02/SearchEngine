Our institution has been selectively using direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) to overcome this problem. Unbeknownst to clinicians, this affected our laboratory\u2019s method for measuring fibrinogen levels, causing them to be vastly underestimated. An example of the magnitude in underestimation is provided in theFigure for illustrative purposes.",

Platelet poor plasma is exposed to a reagent containing supraphysiologic concentrations of thrombin and clot formation is sensed by mechanical or photo-optical means. The time to clot detection is compared against reference plasma to generate a corresponding fibrinogen level. The concentration of thrombin in the Clauss reagent varies by manufacturer and what instrumentation is being used. When present in the patient sample, DTIs inhibit the thrombin in the Clauss reagent, prolonging the time to clot formation, and thus underestimating the fibrinogen concentration. Reagents with lower thrombin concentrations are more susceptible to DTI inference. This problem has been reported on several different commercial platforms with samples containing both bivalirudin and argatroban.4,5",

This involves taking the patient plasma sample and performing a 1:1 dilution with HemosIL Factor Diluent (Instrumentation Laboratories), a nonactive buffer solution. This reduces the effect of the DTI. TheFigure provides an example of how large a difference this can make on the measurement of fibrinogen levels.",

The clottingtimewas appropriately prolonged, indicating thrombin inhibition by the argatroban, while the increased maximum clotfirmnesswas still able to reflect the hyperfibrinogenemia that was present. This discordance between the ROTEM findings and the reported fibrinogen level by the Clauss method prompted the initial investigations into diluting the DTI samples.",
