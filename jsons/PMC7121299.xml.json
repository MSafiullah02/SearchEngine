            "text": "Acute liver failure (ALF) is among the very few dramatically devastating illnesses in medicine. It is a rare disorder characterized by rapid-onset severe hepatocellular injury and dysfunction which can quickly progress to multisystem organ failure and death. It is characterized by signs of severe liver function abnormalities including jaundice, coagulopathy, and/or hepatic encephalopathy within a few weeks of onset of the disease. In adults, ALF is defined as onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of signs of hepatic dysfunction, i.e., jaundice and coagulopathy [1]. This definition of ALF in adults cannot be applied directly to children because it is difficult to accurately assess age-appropriate mental status and exact duration of illness in children. Also, hepatic encephalopathy may not be clinically apparent until terminal stages of liver failure in children [2]. This makes diagnosis of acute liver failure especially challenging in children [3, 4].",

In infants, infections and metabolic diseases are the most common known etiologies for PALF [7, 8]. Herpes simplex virus is the most commonly identified infectious etiology in these children. Galactosemia, tyrosinemia, and fatty acid oxidation defect are the commonly identified metabolic disorders in this age group, while neonatal hemochromatosis was the most common cause of liver failure in the neonatal period [7]. In children older than 7 months of age with ALF, drug toxicity, especially with acetaminophen overdose, and autoimmune hepatitis are the most commonly identified etiologies [7, 8]. In developing countries, infectious etiologies remain the most common identified cause of acute liver failure through all age groups. Hepatitis A viral infection is the most common infectious agent in these countries [8].",

Additional tests to assess for etiology of liver failure should be tailored to the age and presentation of the illness. These should be targeted to evaluate for infectious, metabolic, and autoimmune liver diseases in addition to drug or other toxin exposures (Table 9.1) [9]. A complete abdominal ultrasound with Doppler should be obtained in all patients with PALF, but additional imaging studies like CT, MRI, and/or MRCP should be considered based on the individual case. Liver biopsy should be considered early in the course of PALF to assess for the cause of liver failure and the extent and pattern of hepatocyte injury. Transjugular approach is preferred in the setting of severe coagulopathy with liver failure. The level of necrosis might be underestimated on liver biopsy [10]. Submassive or massive liver necrosis is associated with poor prognosis [11].\n",

Ammonia is a by-product of nitrogen metabolism that is generated from the breakdown of glutamine by glutaminase, an enzyme within the enterocytes of the small intestine and colon, and by urease-producing bacteria that inhabit the gut. This gut-derived ammonia enters the urea cycle to be detoxified into urea and excreted in the urine. Ammonia that bypasses this detoxification is converted to glutamine in hepatocytes, skeletal myocytes, and astrocytes in brain. Astrocytes are the most abundant type of cells in the brain. They are very sensitive to a rapid increase in ammonia, which subsequently leads to cellular edema due to increased influx of water secondary to osmotic gradient created by increased intracellular glutamine. Although hyperammonemia has been implicated to play a pivotal role in development of hepatic encephalopathy, a consistent correlation between the plasma concentration of ammonia and clinical manifestation of HE has not been established [14]. In addition to hyperammonemia, increased proinflammatory circulatory cytokines like IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 can modulate cerebral blood flow and cellular permeability to have direct or permissive effects on development and progression of HE into cerebral edema [15].",

Lactulose is a synthetic nonabsorbable disaccharide which can be used to decrease intraluminal pH in the colon and prevent uptake of ammonia from the gastrointestinal lumen. Given the central role of increased arterial ammonia levels in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, one could assume that ammonia-lowering strategies might be effective in halting the progression of neurological deterioration. While the abovementioned agents have a role in preventing progression of HE associated with cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease, there are no controlled trials to support the use of these medications to treat hepatic encephalopathy in ALF [16\u201318]. In one nonrandomized retrospective series, there was no improvement in outcome with lactulose therapy [19]. Lactulose use should be avoided in PALF as it has the potential to cause intravascular volume depletion, hypernatremia, and bowel distension or megacolon, which can be dangerous during transplant [16, 17]. Neomycin is also not recommended due to increased risk of nephrotoxicity [16]. L-Ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) and L-ornithine phenyl acetate (LOPA) have shown promising results in adult trials [20]. These work by increasing renal excretion of ammonia. Currently, there is no data to support their use in PALF. The benefit of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in reducing serum ammonia and improving 21-day transplant-free survival has been demonstrated in a recent cohort study from US ALF study group registry [21].",

Multiple studies have been done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring in management of ALF, but there has been no demonstrated improvement in survival [23\u201325]. The use of invasive intracranial monitoring in PALF is controversial owing to the lack of sufficient evidence for its routine use and safety.

Mannitol also decreases viscosity of blood causing vasoconstriction, which leads to less cerebral blood volume and decreased ICP. It is used as a first-line agent in management of increased ICP in adults with ALF [16, 17]. The recommended dose for use is 0.25\u20131.0 gm/kg IV bolus that can be repeated once or twice [16, 17]. The majority of information on mannitol in PALF is extrapolated from adult literature. The effect of mannitol is transient, and it is difficult to achieve sustained reduction of ICP to acceptable levels with mannitol alone. The use of mannitol is not recommended in presence of renal failure, hypovolemia, or serum osmolality >320 mOsm/L [16, 17].",

However, clinical assessment of neurological status in pediatric patients can be difficult. Head imaging with computerized tomography (CT) scan is used to exclude intracranial hemorrhage as a cause of sudden decline in neurological status. However, in a recent single-center retrospective pediatric study assessing the role EEG in management of PALF by Hussain et al. [34], CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), even though abnormal in 13% of patients, failed to demonstrate consistent abnormalities to suggest the presence of cerebral edema. There was no association between EEG and CT/MRI findings in this study. However, there was increased mortality in patients with certain EEG abnormalities. These included moderate to severe slowing, epileptiform discharge, and electrographic seizure. EEG seems to be a very sensitive tool to screen not only for subclinical seizures but also declining neurological status in patients progressing to grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy or with unexplained clinical deterioration [34, 35]. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography has been shown to be helpful in measuring dynamic changes in ICP in a small retrospective study in adults with ALF [36].

In the study by Hussain et al. 11% of patients had clinical seizures; however, almost 5% of patients had subclinical nonconvulsive seizures [34]. Continuous EEG should be used in patients with grade 3 or 4 HE or with acute decline in neurological status to rule out subclinical seizures [4, 35]. Aggressive antiepileptic therapy should be implemented to control seizures to prevent further neurological morbidity. Phenytoin can be used for prompt control of epileptiform activity, and short-acting benzodiazepines can be used in phenytoin-refractory cases [17]. Valproic acid should be avoided if mitochondrial disease is suspected as the underlying etiology for ALF. Prophylactic phenytoin has been tried to suppress subclinical epileptiform activity in adults with ALF; however, a subsequent trial demonstrated no benefit of its use in preventing seizures, brain edema, or improving survival [35, 37]. There are no pediatric trials to support the use of prophylactic phenytoin in management of PALF. Prophylactic phenytoin, therefore, cannot be recommended in PALF at this time. Although there are rare reports of drug-induced liver injury with levetiracetam, it can be safely used in management of seizures in PALF.",

            "text": "Pain can arise from multiple diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and procedures in patients with PALF. Psychomotor agitation is known to increase ICP, and this may be especially deleterious in advanced stages of hepatic encephalopathy. Pain management and sedation are important components of critical care management of children with ALF. Sedating non-intubated patients may be necessary, and anxiolytics should be used after carefully weighing the benefit of reducing agitation versus blunting the signs of neurological deterioration and exacerbating encephalopathy [4]. Also, numerous drugs used for sedation and analgesia have hepatic or renal clearance. There is a lack of sufficient data for the use of standard sedative or analgesic agents in PALF. Short-acting agents, with appropriate dose adjustments for liver dysfunction, should be used. Benzodiazepines can have prolonged sedative effect when used in patients with hepatic impairment and should be avoided. Furthermore, benzodiazepines and propofol have the potential to worsen HE by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission [38]. Propofol in limited doses and for short period of time may be used in older children without mitochondrial disease, due to shorter recovery time and neuroprotective effect through decreased cerebral blood flow and decrease in ICP [4, 39]. Opioid agents with short half-life such as fentanyl and remifentanil can be used concurrently to improve cardiovascular stability [16]. Dose adjustments are recommended while using dexmedetomidine for its sedative and analgesic effect in PALF as it is metabolized primarily in the liver [40]. Atracurium and cisatracurium are the preferred agents for neuromuscular blockade in PALF. These undergo ester hydrolysis and Hoffman elimination, and their duration of action in liver failure is similar to the same in normal liver function [41]. Vecuronium and rocuronium should be avoided in ALF as they undergo hepatic metabolism.",

If the patient remains hypotensive after fluid resuscitation, vasopressors should be initiated to maintain mean arterial pressures within the age-appropriate normal range. This is crucial to assure adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. Norepinephrine has been the preferred agent in adults, mainly, because it provides a more consistent and predictable increase in cerebral perfusion while minimizing tachycardia and preserving splanchnic circulation [16]. Despite the lack of adequate pediatric data on choice of vasopressors, norepinephrine does seem to be a reasonable choice to optimize organ perfusion in PALF [4]. Vasopressin and its analogues can be used in volume- and norepinephrine-refractory cases to potentiate its effects; however, these should be used cautiously due to the potential direct cerebral vasodilatory effect that may worsen intracranial hypertension [16, 17]. Echocardiography can be used to assess for systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients not responding to volume and vasoactive support.",

Continuous renal replacement therapy is preferred over intermittent hemodialysis due to lower risk of hemodynamic instability and worsening ICP [17, 55]. In a recent study on a large cohort of patients enrolled in ALFSG, serum ammonia modulation with CRRT improved 21-day transplant-free survival [21].

Caloric requirements in these patients increase by about 20% [59]. There is some data to guide nutrition in children with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis which can be extrapolated to PALF in the absence of studies to guide nutritional support in PALF [59]. Nutrition in PALF should be aimed at providing adequate calories to meet the metabolic needs, enough glucose to maintain euglycemia, and appropriate amounts of protein to overcome negative nitrogen balance without worsening hyperammonemia [60]. In general, enteral feeds should be used when possible. Formula with high caloric density should be preferred to avoid excess free water administration [16]. Parenteral nutrition is safe in PALF and can be used as a second-line option to provide adequate nutrition in patients who cannot tolerate enteral feedings [60]. When using parenteral nutrition, intravenous lipids can be used as a source of nutrition; however, they should be avoided in patients with some disorders such as mitochondrial diseases due to the concern for abnormal fat metabolism [61]. Glucose infusion rates as high as 10\u201315 mg/kg/min may be required to maintain euglycemia in patients with ALF [4]. Children with ALF have dysregulated homeostatic responses to hypoglycemia, and signs of hypoglycemia may be obscured in the patients with HE. Even though tight glycemic control is promoted for critically ill patients in certain ICUs across the nation, a significant risk can be created with such aggressive interventions in children with PALF and should be avoided [4, 16, 17].",

Overall incidence of bleeding was about 10% with spontaneous upper gastrointestinal bleed being the most common location in ALF. Although elevated INR with or without encephalopathy is a universal requirement for diagnosing a patient with ALF, INR is not a good predictor of risk of bleeding. Elevation in INR is due to decrease in both pro- and anticoagulant factors, and it reflects the synthetic dysfunction of the liver more precisely than the risk of bleeding in ALF. In the abovementioned study, a low platelet count, severity of systemic complications, and SIRS were found to be more important risk factors for bleeding than INR [62]. Platelet count as well as some less commonly used coagulation tests like thromboelastography may be better in assessing the severity of bleeding diathesis [63, 64] as well as guiding potential interventions.",

However, plasma transfusion can be used prior to invasive procedures or in the setting of active bleeding [17]. In patients with ALF at risk of volume overload due to renal injury, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) can be used to facilitate invasive procedures; however, these must be used with caution as systemic venous thrombosis has been reported with its use [66, 67]. Platelet transfusions are advised if platelets <10,000 or <50,000 with evidence of overt bleeding or need for invasive procedure.

However, none of these adequately predict outcome or candidacy for transplantation, and the AASLD guidelines for management of acute liver failure recommend against using these for organ allocation [17]. Prognostic scoring systems for PALF are poorly defined and not adequately validated. The KCHC has been extensively used in adult ALF; however, when the PALF study group tried to validate the criteria for use in non-acetaminophen-induced PALF patients, it did not reliably predict chance of survival in PALF, and its sensitivity and positive predictive value were significantly lower than the original study [86]. Serum albumin level, serum bilirubin level, PT-INR, age, and weight have been used in the Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score to predict mortality in children with chronic liver disease [87]. This scoring system has not been validated for use in PALF. The pediatric liver injury unit (LIU) score is an upcoming dynamic scoring system, which incorporates the use of peak values of total bilirubin and PT-INR during hospitalization to stratify patients into low, medium, or high risk of mortality. It may prove to be a beneficial tool for prediction of outcomes in PALF and thus the need for liver transplantation [88, 89]. Currently, we do not have a single universal scoring system to help reliably predict mortality and need for transplantation, thus streamlining the process of listing and organ allocation in PALF.",

This makes PALF one of the most challenging conditions to manage. Intense supportive care, thorough diagnostic evaluation, and early detection with prompt treatment of complications help improve outcomes. Improved availability of organs for transplant, better prognostic system, and effective liver support systems are highly needed to improve survival and decrease the uncertainty associated with this devastating disease.",
