The disease mainly affects those aged between 6 months and 3 years old, with a peak annual incidence in the second year of life of nearly 5%.2 However, croup does occur in babies as young as 3 months old and in adolescents.2 Although rare, adults can also develop croup symptoms.3 Boys are more susceptible than girls to the disorder, with an overall male/female preponderance of 1\u00b74/1.2 In North America, croup season peaks in late autumn (September to December), but cases are recognised throughout the year, even during the summer.2 In odd-numbered years, the number of children admitted with croup during the peak season is about 50% more than during even-numbered years,4 which closely correlates with the prevalence of parainfluenza virus infection in the community (North America).",

Perhaps individual anatomy plays a part, since some children might have an intrinsically narrower subglottic space. Individual immune factors could be important too, with a range of severity of inflammatory response to infection. The peak incidence of croup at the age of 2 years is also somewhat unexplained and could be attributable to increased exposure to viral pathogens combined with the toddler's smaller subglottic space, leaving them at greater risk for airway narrowing.

Hoarseness and barking cough are usually absent. Dysphagia could be present and stridor is noted variably. Children who have stridor secondary to the presence of a foreign body usually present with a clear history of ingestion.20 Peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess could present with dysphagia, drooling, stridor, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, neck stiffness, and unilateral cervical adenopathy, and a lateral neck radiograph can show posterior pharyngeal oedema and retroflexed cervical vertebrae.46 Acute angioneurotic oedema or allergic reaction can present at any age and with rapid onset of dysphagia and stridor and possible cutaneous allergic signs such as urticarial rash. Children might have a history of allergy or previous attack.20 Laryngeal diphtheria has arisen historically in people of all ages, and a record of inadequate immunisation can be seen. Usually, a prodrome of pharyngitis symptoms is noted and onset is gradual over 2\u20133 days.

Both heliox and racemic epinephrine were associated with similar improvements in croup score over time.76 Findings of a second prospective, randomised, double-blind controlled trial in 15 children with mild croup presenting to an emergency department indicated a trend towards greater improvement in a clinical croup score in the heliox group versus the oxygen-enriched air group, although the scores did not differ significantly.77\n",

On the other hand, four other studies in which different doses of oral dexamethasone were compared have been published; a range of croup severity and both inpatient and outpatient settings were included (table 4).96, 97, 98, 99 None of the trials was designed as a non-inferiority study and all had small sample sizes; none of the four studies showed a significant difference in primary outcome measures between corticosteroid dose sizes.

First, children treated with steroids after exposure to varicella virus can have an increased risk of developing complications of varicella, such as disseminated disease or bacterial superinfection. Published case-control studies addressing this issue have yielded conflicting results. Whereas in one study, an increase in risk of complicated varicella in immunocompetent children treated with steroids was noted,106 in another this finding was not seen.107 The US Food and Drug Administration, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology advise caution in the use of steroids in children who have been exposed to varicella virus.108, 109, 110, 111 On a related issue, there is potential concern that corticosteroid use could prolong viral shedding; however, we were unable to find evidence that addresses this issue.",

Using historical comparisons, the administration of epinephrine in children with severe croup has been reported to have reduced the number needing intubation or tracheotomy by a substantial amount.120 Nebulised racemic epinephrine (2\u00b725%), compared with placebo, improved croup scores within 10\u201330 min of initiation of treatment in three randomised controlled trials.117, 118, 119 In a fourth placebo-controlled trial, a clear benefit was not recorded; however, this trial was not well-designed nor well-reported.121 Objective pathophysiological measures of severity have also shown substantial improvement after epinephrine treatment in five prospective cohort studies.57, 58, 59, 72, 122 Clinical effect is sustained for at least 1 h,57, 58, 59, 117, 119, 121, 123 but it is essentially gone within 2 h of administration.119 Reassuringly, as the effect of epinephrine wears off, the patient's symptoms return\u2014on average\u2014to their baseline severity and do not seem to worsen.118, 119 Combined data from five prospective clinical trials in outpatients treated with epinephrine and dexamethasone (or budesonide) who were observed for 2\u20134 h are also reassuring.

The rate of admission in the dexamethasone-treated group was half that of those given placebo. This finding suggests that observation in an emergency deparment for at least 3 h, and ideally up to 10 h after treatment with corticosteroid, would reduce admission rates, presumably as the beneficial effects of corticosteroids become evident with time. In a published report looking at length of stay in the emergency department and admission, a substantial reduction was recorded in admissions after implementation of a clinical pathway mandating 6 h of observation in the emergency department after corticosteroid treatment before a child with croup was admitted to hospital.137 Based on this evidence and combined with expert opinion, the Alberta Medical Association clinical pathway committee has developed and implemented the management algorithm outlined in the figure.48\n",

Although comparatively fewer reports have been published on epinephrine, sufficient data exist to support the drug's role in short-term symptom relief until corticosteroids take effect. Conversely, after more than a century of use, definitive evidence is available to show the ineffectiveness of mist. Apart from heliox, no new therapeutic interventions are on the horizon. Nonetheless, corticosteroids and epinephrine have greatly reduced health-care use and enhanced outcomes in children with croup.",
