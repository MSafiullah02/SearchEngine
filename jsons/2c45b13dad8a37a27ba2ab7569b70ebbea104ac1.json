The enzymes present in MDBK, MDCK, VERO, BHK, and chick embryo cells required lysinearginine or arginine-arginine pairs as cleavage sites, whereas chorioallantoic membrane cells contained, in addition, an activity that could cleave at a single arginine. The effect of peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones on the activation of the fowl plague virus hemagglutinin by the proteases specific for paired basic residues has been investigated. When virions containing uncleaved hemagglutinin were incubated with lysates of uninfected cells, cleavage was completely inhibited by peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones containing paired basic residues at a concentration of 1 mM. In contrast a compound containing a single arginine had no inhibitory activity. When dibasic peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones were added to infected cell cultures, cleavage of hemagglutinin and multiple cycles of virus replication were inhibited at 10 mM. However, a 1 OO-to 200-fold increase of the inhibitory activity in intact cells could be achieved by N-terminal acylation. These studies suggest a potential role of peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones as antiviral agents.

Cleavage is necessary for the expression of the fusion capacity of the hemagglutinin and, thus, for initiation of infection (Klenk et a/., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) . Two host enzymes are involved in cleavage: first a \"ttypsin-like\" endoprotease acts on a distinct arginine-glycine bond. Subsequently, a carboxypeptidase eliminates the basic amino acids at the cleavage site. Proteolytic activation proved to be of high importance for the spread of infection and for pathogenicity. The hemagglutinins of mammalian and of apathogenic avian influenza viruses which cause local infections are cleaved only in a restricted number of cell types. In contrast, the hemagglutinins of pathogenic avian influenza viruses which cause systemic infection are activated in a broad range of different host cells. Important determinants for these differences in proteolytic activation are the structure of the cleavage site on the hemagglutinin and the specificity of the endoproteases present in individual cells. The hemagglutinin of most apathogenic avian and of mammalian influenza viruses have a single arginine residue at the cleavage site which is recognized by enzymes present only in few ceils, whereas ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. the hemagglutinins of the pathogenic avian influenza viruses have a cleavage site consisting of several basic amino acids which can be cleaved by endoproteases present in many cells (for review see Klenk and Rott, 1988) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 298, "text": "(Klenk et a/., 1975;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 299, "end": 328, "text": "Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1361, "text": "'", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1632, "text": "Klenk and Rott, 1988)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Post-translational proteolytic cleavage at multiple basic residues appears to be a general principle by which many hormones, enzymes, and other biologically important peptides or proteins are activated (Docherty et a/., 1982; Herbert and Uhler, 1982) .

We have also reported that the protease is calcium-dependent and acts at neutral pH (Klenk et a/., 1984) . Cleavage of the FPV hemagglutinin is a late event in intracellular transport and is assumed to occur shortly before the glycoprotein arrives at the plasma membrane (Klenk et al., 1981) . The enzyme responsible for activation of the FPV hemagglutinin shows a number of striking similarities in subcellular location and catalytic properties to enzymes believed to process prohormones at pairs of basic residues in endocrine tissues. Proteases cleaving the insulin precursor, that have been isolated from secretory granula of pancreatic p cells, have been found to be under the control of intraorganellar calcium and pH (Davidson et al., 1987 (Davidson et al., , 1988 . A protease has been isolated from secretory vesicles of the bovine pituitary neural lobe that cleaves proteins and peptides at neutral pH (Parish et al., 1986) . The a-factor matrng pheromone, a peptide hormone from yeast, is activated at pairs of basic residues by a membrane-bound serine protease that is strictly calcium-dependent and has a neutral pH optimum (Thomas et a/., 1988) , exactly as has been observed for the activating enzyme of the FPV hemagglutinin. It is therefore reasonable to assume, but remains to be proven, that the enzymes activating viral glycoproteins and peptide hormones belong to the same family of proteinases. Our data show that the enzymes cleave peptidyl-p-nitroanilides with a similar substrate specificity as influenza virus hemagglutinin. Thus, these chromogenes may substitute for the hemagglutinin, when large amounts of substrate are required, as may be the case, for instance, in studies aimed at the characterization of the activating proteinases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 291, "text": "(Klenk et a/., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 458, "end": 478, "text": "(Klenk et al., 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 911, "end": 933, "text": "(Davidson et al., 1987", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 934, "end": 958, "text": "(Davidson et al., , 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1120, "text": "(Parish et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1345, "text": "(Thomas et a/., 1988)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "As has been pointed out above, a large number of viral glycoproteins are cleaved by cellular proteases at arginine-arginine and lysine-arginine sites. It will be interesting to see whether cleavage of these glycoproteins can also be inhibited by the compounds analyzed here. With many of these viruses, e.g., the togaviruses, the coronaviruses, the arenaviruses, the herpes viruses, and most of the retroviruses, the biological significance of the cleavage reaction is not understood. Studies with inhibitors of the type analyzed here should throw light on this problem. In cases, where cleavage of a protein at an arginine-containing site has been suspected, but not definitely proven, the use of peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones might result in the accumulation of polypeptides which so far have not been identified as precursors. The inhibitors might, thus, also help to elucidate new precursor-product relationships. The list of viruses that depend on proteolytic activation of a glycoprotein to spread in the organism in-cludes HIV 1 (McCune et al., 1988 ) and many other important pathogens. The application of peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones as antiviral agents is therefore worth considering. As has already been pointed out above, the available evidence indicates that cleavage activation at arginine residues is a mechanism by which also essential cellular functions are regulated. Peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones are therefore usually considered toxic and their application for therapeutic purposes may not be feasible. However, we have shown here that activation of the FPV hemagglutinin is blocked by FAKR-CMK, but not by FAK-CMK. Thus, our data provide evidence for some sequence-specificity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1035, "end": 1055, "text": "(McCune et al., 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "As has been pointed out above, with most viral and cellular proteins the cleavage site consists not only of a pair but of a whole series of basic residues, which all may contribute to its specificity as a recognition signal for the activating proteinases. Furthermore, among different proteins there is considerable sequence variation in the connecting peptides. It may therefore be desirable to construct chloroalkyl ketones with an extended peptide showing exact homology to a specific cleavage site.
