Four common human coronaviruses that cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses, including 229E (alpha coronavirus), NL63 (alpha coronavirus), OC43 (beta coronavirus), and HKU1 (beta coronavirus), were first recorded in the 1960 s. Two other human coronaviruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which lead to severe lung infections known as severe acute respiratory syndrome \u2013 SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome \u2013 MERS, respectively [1,2]. The SARS-CoV outbreak occurred in 2002, starting in China and spreading to other countries, with a death rate of 11%. The MERS-CoV outbreak occurred in 2012, starting in Saudi Arabia and spreading to other countries, with a death rate of 37%. Now, we are seeing the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, which can affect both upper respiratory and lower respiratory tracts and causes unusual viral pneumonia, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). All of the three coronaviruses that have caused human pandemics are of beta coronaviruses.",

In its initiation stage, the 2019-nCoV would increase plasma concentrations of different cytokines, including IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20101R\u03b1, IL\u20107, IL\u20108, IL\u20109, IL\u201010, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and vascular endothelial growth factor [7]. Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) showed higher levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 compared with those who did not need to be in an ICU [7]. The work of 2019-nCoV seems to be an interplay between different T-helper (Th) cell population subsets, e.g., Th1, Th2, and Treg. There are instances, in both microparasites and macroparasites, which have been correlated with such this orchestration of immune responses.

Thus, there is a promising point that the treatment of symptomatic individuals can be useful. However, it should be mentioned that the reproduction number varies over time depending on the estimation models. The average reproduction number estimated by stochastic methods, mathematical methods, and exponential growth are 2.44, 4.2, and 2.67, respectively [16]. Moreover, simulation methods predict that with continuing efforts Wuhan would achieve a reproduction number of less than one soon [17].

Early interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) induction in viral infections indicates a battle between the innate immunity and the virus. In colder temperature, IFN-\u03b3 production by the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that are essential for the recognition of viral RNA by the innate immunity decreases in airway cells, so well adapted for viral replication [19]. Then, the immune system would commence fever, to allow the expression of the TLR4, and trigger from this a series of anti-viral immune responses characterized by the production of cytokines [20].
