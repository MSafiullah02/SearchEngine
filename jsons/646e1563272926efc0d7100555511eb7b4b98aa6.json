In adults, sputum samples are considered to be a valuable, noninvasive alternative for bacterial detection, but it is often not feasible to obtain a sputum sample from children. Therefore, most pediatric studies are based on samples obtained from the upper respiratory tract (URT) and blood samples. However, the URT is frequently colonized by bacterial pathogens [3, 7] , making it difficult to discriminate commensal organisms and acute pathogens. Moreover, although blood is normally sterile and blood cultures are highly specific, the sensitivity of blood cultures in childhood CAP is low (4%-18%) [6, 7] . Serological tests for the detection of viruses and atypical microorganisms are of limited use in clinical practice because of the need for convalescent-phase serum samples.",

BAL fluid has the advantage of being suitable for multiple detection methods, including microscopy, aerobic culture, viral culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protected brushes cannot pass the pediatric flexible bronchoscope, but the risk of oropharyngeal contamination can be reduced considerably with careful technique [10] . Interpretation of BAL results is more reliable with the use of quantitative bacterial culture [1, 7, 8, 11, 12] . The reliability of FOB plus BAL used with these precautions has been demonstrated, with some authors reporting specificities of 97%-100% for potential pathogens in relation to actual pneumonia [7, 13] .

However, most of these studies involved URT samples, and thus had limited specificity for detecting bacterial pathogens, with few studies involving samples of the LRT or lung aspirates [3, 21, 22] . Among the aerobic bacteria, which were isolated in approximately half of infections, we found a predominance of NTHi in both groups of children; approximately three-quarters were H. influenzae, of which 97.9% were NTHi. To our knowledge, this is the first such reported finding since those of Shann et al [22] and Weinberg et al [23] in the 1980s. Since then, studies involving children with CAP or LRT infection (using serological testing or TNA) have suggested a possible role for NTHi in pediatric pneumonia but have failed to define it as a significant pathogen [24] . For example, in a recent study involving 34 children with CAP, 16 cases were attributed to S. pneumoniae and no case of H. influenzae infection was found using TNA [25] . However, the study included a small number of patients and investigated lobar CAP only. It is also possible that NTHi infection was missed in previous studies of pediatric CAP because the methodology was not appropriate for NTHi detection. NTHi does not easily invade the bloodstream or pleura [22, 26] , and misclassification of NTHi strains as Hib strains using the slide agglutination technique has been reported [27] . Also, in many TNA studies, the culture media used were not appropriate for detecting H. influenzae and, if H. influenzae was found, strains were not serotyped [22] . The reliability of our finding that NTHi is frequently involved as a pathogen in childhood CAP is supported by the sterility of the LRT in healthy subjects and the finding that, in children with unilateral CAP, BAL culture of the contralateral side has negative results [10, 12] , as well as by the established pathogenicity of NTHi in another normally sterile site, the middle ear. NTHi is associated with persistent, nonresponsive acute otitis media (AOM) [28, 29] , possibly attributable to the choice of treatment (amoxicillin is used as first-line treatment), leading to the selection of b-lactamase-positive H. influenzae [29] . This was not the case in our study, because 77% of NTHi isolates were b-lactamase negative. In AOM, NTHi has a clear association with recurrence .1 month after the completion of antibiotic therapy, with an incidence of 32% in third and subsequent episodes [29] . NTHi infection contributes to complications in AOM and is clinically indistinguishable from AOM caused by S. pneumoniae [29] . It is therefore possible Chlamydophila pneumoniae 0/58 tested (0) 3/54 tested (5.6) NS NOTE.

Indeed, it is now increasingly recognized that NTHi is capable of causing invasive disease, particularly neonatal sepsis, and is also a cause of CAP, bacteremia and, to a lesser extent, meningitis [30, 31] . Moreover, we are confident that the risk of contamination in BAL samples was limited considerably, because various technical measures were taken to avoid contamination by URT secretions and a significance cutoff value was used for bacterial BAL culture [1, 8, [10] [11] [12] . Although a significance cutoff of R10 3 colonyforming units (cfu)/mL has been shown to be reliable in adults [7, 32] , we have chosen to use a higher cutoff value of R10 4 cfu/mL, because colonization of the URT is more common in children. The finding that only 2.8% of the Haemophilus strains detected in our study were nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus, whereas previous studies showed that the prevalence of nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus in throat swab samples obtained from healthy children or adults was 16%-21% [16, 33] , also supports the reliability of our results.",

Although the role of each isolated pathogen cannot be defined, previous findings of coinfection and recent insights into interspecies quorum signaling suggest an individual role for each pathogen and/or possible interaction between them [34] . In Belgium, universal childhood vaccination against H. influenzae type b (Hib) was introduced in the 1990s and might explain the absence of any case of infection due to Hib in our study. However, because universal childhood pneumococcal vaccination using PCV7 was only started in 2007, it is very unlikely that it may have influenced our results.",

M. pneumoniae was a predominant pathogen in the NR-CAP group but not in the Rec-CAP group. Most of the patients with NR-CAP had been treated with penicillin or aminopenicillins, the first-line antibiotics for treatment of CAP, and the predominance of M. pneumoniae gives a possible reason for nonresponsiveness. Viruses were found in 30.4% of cases, with RSV, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenzaviruses being detected most frequently. This incidence is relatively low, compared with the findings of other studies [5, 20] , and may have been due to omission of rhinovirus in the PCR assay. Virus detection was slightly more frequent in the NR-CAP group. Viruses were the sole pathogen more than twice as often in the NR-CAP group than in the Rec-CAP group, possibly providing another explanation for nonresponsiveness to initial antibiotic therapy. Viral coinfections, which were found in 6.4% of cases overall, are rarely reported in most studies of CAP, although one study reported an incidence of 14% for all CAP cases and 22% for viral CAP cases [5] . Mixed infections were found in 24.4% of cases, which was comparable to previous findings [19, 20, 40] .",
