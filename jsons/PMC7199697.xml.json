The disease was later named COVID-19 standing for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. Most countries were affected by the disease and Iraqi Kurdistan was not an exempt. The rising cases of COVID-19 in European countries and a neighboring country, Iran had been alarming. Therefore, an action was carried out, especially after the first case was reported in Iran with an increasing trend after February 2020 [2]. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) dispatched health measures for travelers and raised awareness in the general population. Hence, public and private schools and universities were announced to be closed from February 26 until May 2, 2020. Curfew was imposed on March 13 until April 23, 2020. Any traveler arriving from an epidemic area of COVID-19 is quarantined for at least 14 days and tested by molecular assay for the novel virus [3].",

The frequent clinical manifestations are fever, dry cough, shortness of breath (SOB), and pneumonia; whereas less frequent features are headache, diarrhea, productive cough, runny nose, and hemoptysis [5]. Overall, the clinical features of the disease range from mild to severe illnesses. The severe form occurs in patients with risk factors such as old age (\u226565 years), smokers, and comorbid diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension \u2026 etc. [6]. The median incubation period of the disease is 5\u20136 days; however, it can take up to 24 days [7]. Although the transmission may occur early in the course of the disease, the period of infectivity is uncertain [8]. The spread of the virus has great epidemiological concerns; hence preventing the transmission is the primary goal toward controlling the disease. The COVID-19 patients may show varying degrees of laboratory abnormalities e.g. leukopenia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia \u2026 etc [9]. The chest x-ray (CXR) and CT scan findings are usually normal in early stages of the disease; however, it may show bilateral infiltrates and ground glass opacity in late stages and more severe forms [9,10].",

The slightly high frequency (40%) of asymptomatic patients in this study can be partly justified by systematic testing of close contacts of COVID-19 index patients. The most reported symptoms were fever, cough, and SOB, which was in concordance to findings of other literatures [9,18]. Interestingly, 4 patients (26.7%) showed smell and taste disorders. This finding was in correspondence to a study from Italy on COVID-19 patients where 34% reported such disorders [19].

Additionally, as BCG is included in universal vaccination program in Iraq for infants; it might hypothesize its role in reducing the disease's severity. There are manuscripts, not peer reviewed, supporting the role of BCG in reducing morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients [21,22]. In this study, one patient had moderate to severe illness and another one had mild to moderate illness. Both patients were index cases from Europe. These findings are in line with the seventh report about rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 in Europe, which assessed the risk of severe illnesses among general population to be moderate [18]. Fortunately, we did not report any deaths, perhaps as most patients were mild cases, less than 50 years and without underlying comorbid diseases.",
