            "text": "[1] Access to adequate supplies is crucial to preventing transmission of pathogens, especially in resourcelimited settings. [3] Reports across several countries found that healthcare workers are more at risk of catching SARS-CoV2 as well as at higher risk of severe COVID-19, possibly due to exposure to higher viral load. [4] The outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy showed that inadequate access to protective equipment is one of the reasons why healthcare workers, and particularly GPs, experienced high rates of infection. [2] Aside from the direct health effects, absenteeism from illness may also negatively affect the health system's capacity to adequately respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it makes healthcare workers feel unsafe and unprotected, which undermines morale as shown in a report on England's National Health Service health workers experiences. [5] One of the possible (short-term pragmatic) solutions could be the reuse of equipment, and in particular that of respirators. To reuse a mask or respirator, it should be sterilized first. The method applied should: 1) kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus (diminish the viral load); 2) keep the mask's protective properties (largely) intact, in terms of filter and fit. In primary care, the medical autoclave is normally used to sterilize surgical instruments. The process of pressurized moist heat destroys microorganisms by the irreversible coagulation and denaturation of enzymes and structural proteins, and has been shown to be effective in respirators contaminated with other viruses, such as H1N1 influenza virus. [2, 6, 7] However, the question is whether the respirator's protective properties in terms of filter function and fit will remain intact when exposing the respirator to steam. We therefore set out to study whether the process of steam sterilization negatively affects the protective properties of commonly used respirators which are designed to protect the wearer against the inhalation of both droplets and particles suspended in the air.",

For high-risk patients, the center provides GPs with filtering facepiece particles (FFP) type 2 or type 3 for personal protection. For the current study, worn respirators were used for reprocessing using a medical autoclave. After the autoclave procedure the respirators were visually inspected for deformity by two clinical investigators, followed by a seal check. The masks were subsequently marked and sent by courier to the GreenCycl testing laboratory in Utrecht, the Netherlands. At this .

The size as well as the cycle times differ from autoclaves typically used in hospitals, which are larger and have longer cycle times, however with comparable peak times regarding sterilization. The Kronos S18 autoclave holds a capacity of 18L or 4 respirators. The autoclave has specific programs for \"solid made of rubber and delicate solids\", which includes respirators.

            "text": "After sterilization the respirators were checked for visual deformities of the mask as well as the elastic straps. Subsequently, the respirators were put on to evaluate whether breathing felt normal, followed by the performance of a user seal check. A negative pressure user seal check was used for all respirators in which the clinical investigator inhaled sharply while blocking the paths for air to enter the facepiece. A successful check is when the facepiece collapsed slightly under the negative pressure that was created with this maneuver. For respirators without an exhalation valve the investigator also performed a positive pressure check by exhaling gently while blocking the paths for air to exit the facepiece. A successful check is when the facepiece was slightly pressurized before increased pressure causes outward leakage. [9] Particle penetration test At the testing laboratory two independent researchers from the Delft University of Technology tested the masks using a dry particle penetration test setup ( Figure 1A) . [10] The equipment involved a SOLAIR 3100 particle counter (Lighthouse Worldwide Solutions Inc, Fremont, CA). The particles are counted within the machine via a tube that is connected to a particle chamber to which the respirator is secured. The transparent lid presses the mask such that it prevents material buckling and creates an airtight seal that only allows air to pass through the material. Before each measurement, a benchmark test is conducted with 28 Liters of surrounding air that is sucked through the particle chamber into the particle counter. During this measurement no mask is installed. During the test measurement, a mask is installed on the particle chamber. Therefore, the 28 liter of surrounding air is sucked through the filter material of the mask and the remaining particles are counted in the categories of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 microns. The measurements are compared and the filtering capacity derived based on the difference in the readings compared to the benchmark test. A lower number of particles counted after filtering in relation to the benchmark test would indicate better filtering performance. [11] The system setup is more conservative than the NEN-149 standard, which means the resulting filter capacity percentages cannot be translated .

(Figure 1B) The Sensirion pressure sensor was connected with a T-piece between the particle chamber and Lighthouse 3100. An additional valve was used to adjust the input pressure within range of the sensor. A LabJack T7 analogue input device was used to convert the output from the pressure sensor to an output voltage of 0 to 5 Volt. An output value of 5V was representing 500Pa and set as 100% of input pressure. the atmospheric input pressure of 2.42 Volt was defined as 0% output. Measurements were conducted with a constant air speed of 20.7 meter per seconds at the opening of the particle chamber.",

In this study we found that steam sterilization at 121 degrees Celsius may provide a viable option for selected respirators, but it also sheds a light on the variability in the protective properties of the various available respirators and respirators. Of the tested respirators, the filter capacity of the 3M Aura 1862+ respirator fared best with a consistently high filter capacity for the 0.3 \u03bcm particle size category and above after multiple cycles of steam sterilization.

A recent analysis of the Dutch Centers of Disease Control (RIVM) also found that steam sterilization at higher temperatures deformed the masks [12]. To our knowledge there is only one prior study that assessed the impact of steam sterilization on the filter capacity of facepiece respirators, which was a study by Lin and colleagues in 2017. [13] In this study, the authors found that one of the decontamination processes that appeared effective for N95 respirators was the medical autoclave, in which they exposed the respirators to saturated steam at 121 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes. They found that filter quality (\u00b395%) of the masks remained intact using a range of particles. These findings are comparable to those we present in this paper.",
