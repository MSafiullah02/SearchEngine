Nevertheless, there is a concern about whether Newton\u2019s rules guarantee truth. I intend to show that this concern is misguided. However, against the criticism that these rules do not guarantee valid inferences, Newton\u2019s rules are defendable insofar as they satisfy Goodman\u2019s criteria for inductive rules and Newton\u2019s own methodological program of experimental philosophy; provided that cross-checks are used prior to applications of rule 4 and immediately after applications of rule 2 the following activities are pursued: (1) research addressing observations that systematically deviate from theoretical idealizations and (2) applications of theory that safeguard ongoing research from proceeding down a garden path. This paper will not include a defense of Goodman\u2019s criteria, but will argue that if his criteria are accepted, then given my defense of Newton\u2019s rules as satisfying that criteria, Newton\u2019s rules of reasoning are valid.",

Rules 1 and 2 are used in the same way to designate all celestial centripetal acceleration as the gravitational kind.

Another importance of the rule is that the last step in the argument for universal gravity requires a generalization to all particles in the universe that only rule 3 provides. Also, notice that the first use of rule 3 is for an induction from terrestrial bodies to all bodies near the earth while the second use is for an induction from all bodies near the earth to all bodies near any planet.

There are as many orbits of a planet as it has revolutions, as in the motion of the Moon \u2026 But to consider simultaneously all these causes of motion and to define these motions by exact laws admitting of easy calculation exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind.

An appeal to rule 1 does not work since seven fifths, ten sevenths, and three halves are all simple fractions and are all equally supported by the data (since the imprecision in data exceeds these fractions). An appeal to rule 2 or rule 3 is unhelpful since they do not apply. Invoking rule 4 is unhelpful because this rule presupposes that the induction has already been made. Hence, unless Newton is invoking a rule that he has not mentioned, his phenomena are invalidly inferred. Nesting a rule on an invalid induction makes the rule invalid.

Also, the process of developing increasingly better idealizations of the world reduces the amount of adjustments that a theory will need to make in order to explicate the world. In this sense, each successful explication of theory-dependent second-order phenomena with theory developed in part by rule 2 not only increases support for rule 2, but decreases the number of instances in which rule 2 can mislead.

In particular, Newton uses the theory to account for the periodicity of Halley\u2019s comet, which recurs every seventy-five to seventy-seven years. Since the third edition of the Principia was published in 1726, and the last sighting of Halley\u2019s comet before the third edition was in 1682, this particular safeguard could have been substantiated as early as thirty-one years after the Principia\u2019s publication; which could have reduced the length of a garden path involving rule 2 to a matter of three decades.
