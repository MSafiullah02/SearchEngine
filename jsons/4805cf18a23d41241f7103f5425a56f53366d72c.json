As Ashton recounts it, his is indeed \"the first attempt to describe and compare the forests of one whole tropical region as a unity.\"",

Three years later, he returned to Cambridge with \"an impressive knowledge of a hyperdiverse local flora, classified according to the Iban terminology.\" The book is dedicated to these men, and Ashton's is far from the only case of indigenous initiation for an academic ecologist. Tropical forest science has been shaped by rainforest peoples perhaps more than we care to admit. In this, it is no different from modern art, also inspired by indigenous traditions, except, for example, Picasso's African period lasted only 3 years, whereas Ashton's tropical Asia period is entering its 60th year and still going strong.",

Curtis devised a new analytical method, ordination, so that \"after three weeks of 14-hour days on a hand calculator, the coefficients of similarity between plots were ready and patterns gradually emerged.\" Modern ordinations provide a guide to the composition of various forest types in Asia. This perspective is expanded to elevational gradients and augmented with phylogenetic and phylogeographic perspectives. The chapter on the mechanisms maintaining forest diversity goes well beyond the usual dichotomy between neutral and niche theory frameworks in that it discusses the often complicated interplay of historical accident, environmental filters, niche structure, and neutral dynamics in individual forests. Unsurprisingly, the result is not particularly satisfying for ecology students who would prefer to learn a single, all-explaining principle for rainforest biodiversity.",

The book gives an excellent, unsentimental analysis of current pressures on forests that acknowledges significant opportunity costs of rainforest protection, both for indigenous peoples and entire countries. Rainforest value in Asia, following a Kuznets curve, is now, at the height of industrialization, probably around its historical minimum. It should increase again with continuing economic development. Will Asian societies develop fast enough for the forests to become valued again before they are all gone? The race between economic growth and forest destruction is full of suspense.",

Few present-day tropical ecologists start their research careers to the sound of tropical trees crashing to the ground, cleared to make space for their own research station in a remote rainforest, but to a sufficiently determined biologist Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the few places on Earth that still provides this kind of academic freedom.",

The birth of the Sera Field Station in one of the least accessible rainforests of PNG rates among the more adventurous and entertaining reports on doctoral research available in contemporary biological literature. In PNG, rules that are part of tribal oral history guide the present day ownership of forests, forcing Mack to negotiate fieldwork with village landowners. Unfortunately, few western academics have a natural talent for playing tribal politics in an alien culture. Mack vividly describes how these academics inevitably caused misunderstanding and conflict but also forged relationships that ultimately benefitted their research. A lifetime spent in the rainforest makes Papua New Guineans highly efficient field researchers with a formidable knowledge of natural history, although one that is not structured according to the canons of hypothesis-driven Western science (Novotny et al. 2012) . The close encounters between university academics and villagers tend to be in equal measure frustrating and enlightening for both sides.",

Together, they control the fate of the country's forests, making decisions about conservation and exploitation of natural resources. This may sound like good news for conservation to foreigners who subscribe to the myth that rainforest dwellers are all born conservationists. In reality, however, tribal societies prefer to maintain their lifestyle while eagerly seeking, testing, and absorbing novel ideas and items from the outside world. Conservation needs to support such synthesis of tradition and modernity by providing a viable income or be easily defeated by the allure of logging royalties (Novotny 2010). Mack describes often rather desperate efforts to integrate conservation with so-called sustainable business projects that would pay conservation costs, including implausibly located ecotourist lodges and marketing schemes for rainforest products that do not have a market. His experience with international conservation leads to a seemingly common sense, but in the world of practical conservation still radical, epiphany; that is, rainforest conservation in PNG and other tropical countries can never succeed unless driven by local conservationists and overseas experts would be best utilized to train nationals rather than executing conservation plans themselves in places where they lack the necessary social skills and political clout to sustain them.",

            "text": "Tropical conservation is socially complicated because it connects three very different worlds with often conflicting interests: rainforest village societies and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), government agencies, and international conservation NGOs. The villagers, who are theoretically rich because they own a globally important biodiversity estate, although one that often lacks the basic amenities such as electricity and healthcare, often view their partner NGOs, with salaried staff and air-conditioned offices, as living in excessive luxury and being paid with funds that should rightfully be going to the forest owners (West 2006). Mack's sentiments toward the even better appointed headquarters of global conservation organizations mirror those of the villagers towards their local NGOs. His critique of overseas-driven conservation would have benefited from a broader examination of conservation projects in PNG that included NGOs with which he had not been personally involved. Similar comparative analyses are conspicuously lacking in the world of donor-driven conservation, where every project has to be an unqualified success. In a perfect world, training of conservation experts and professional biologists should be spearheaded by local universities rather than conservation projects. However, many developing tropical countries, including PNG, have only teaching universities that lack research facilities and expect their staff to teach full time. As a result, students of such institutions rarely see, let alone experience, research in action. These countries also often lack the mechanisms for awarding funds according to the quality of research that could support the careers of promising young scientists. Tutoring students and junior biologists may be a more efficient long-term strategy for conservation in these countries than seemingly more direct efforts at establishing conservation areas. The main point of Mack's book, that overseas-driven conservation is doomed without a supportive indigenous academic community, is a valid one. It is an important insight, earned after years of hardship, and delivered in the most entertaining manner. These three books deal with a range of important topics that have direct or indirect relevance to conservation biology. Two focus on the emergence and reemergence of pests and diseases, whereas the third examines the politics and differing perspectives prevalent in the field of conservation. In all three books, the authors have used case studies to illustrate key concepts, and in doing so they made the material more accessible to a broader audience than would generally be the case with more specialized textbooks. With the media's coverage of a wide range of scientific topics and the growing availability of pseudoscientific information through the internet, there is a need for academics to make their research, and scientific perspective, more readily available to the public. To be effective, this needs to be done in a readable format using a style to which a broad audience can relate. In considering the value of this approach, academics need to be aware that the more formal scientific literature is rarely accessed by the public and so there is a growing need for researchers and subject experts to share their findings with a wider audience through different formats including popular media.",

One of the chapters that I found most interesting was the author's perspective on the first cases of the prion disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), on a farm in the United Kingdom. This and other examples are reminders to be aware that new diseases can emerge as a result of human interference, including changes in agricultural practice, as well as occurring as a result of pathogen evolution and natural selection pressure. In another chapter, Walters' uses an example from southern Asia to illustrate the potential harm that using tainted fish products in animal feed can have, and he explores a potential link of such practices to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.",

Recently, there have been several candidates for such a virus, including the H5N1 bird flu, which circulated widely across Asia and Europe in 2003 and more recently the emergence of a new strain of influenza in swine with zoonotic potential (H1N1). There is ongoing concern that concurrent emergence of new influenza strains in pigs and poultry and subsequent infection of humans could result in viral strains with enhanced potential to transmit from human to human (Capua & Alexander 2002; Kalthoff et al. 2010; Van Ranst & Lemey 2013) .

I especially enjoyed Monosson's insights into gene expression and how environmental stressors are leaving their mark on plants, animals, and humans, potentially for generations to come. In layman's terms Monosson, a toxicologist, eloquently describes how life is resilient, and she cleverly illustrates her thoughts with contemporary examples that should interest a wide readership. The chapter on bedbugs, in particular, provides a good example of an emerging problem that was previously considered easy to address with readily available insecticides. The emergence of resistant strains of bedbugs as well as current concerns over increasingly resistant strains of head lice should stimulate interest from a wide readership especially given these examples may represent the tip of the iceberg with regard to what society may face in both the developed and developing world (Downs et al. 2002; Zhu et al. 2013) . The evolutionary adaptations of insects, bacteria, and other organisms will not surprise evolutionary biologists, but the public may find the information disturbing.
