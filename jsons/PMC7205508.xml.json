The results of these models are, nonetheless, based on assumptions; in fact, we do not know anything about many aspects of the disease. We do know that there is no effective treatment or vaccine and that none is likely to be developed and widely available in the near future. Nonetheless, the results of such models have led many people including some government officials, to believe that \u201cthe show must go on\u201d and that we have no choice but to let 60% to 70% of the population contract the disease to become naturally immune. This scenario, however, leaves millions of dead bodies in the aftermath, in the most optimistic estimate. Another problem with this belief is that the virus can readily pass through many people and mutate to become another novel virus that reinfects those who think they are immune. If so, the emerging virus might have an even higher mortality! Therefore, letting people acquire natural immunity by catching the infection is primitive and potentially more dangerous; it is clearly not an option.\n",
