The performance of selected microarray antigens for the detection of IgG antibodies against herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, was evaluated using serum sample panels tested with reference assays used in a routine diagnostic laboratory. The microarray sensitivity for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, adenovirus and M. pneumonia ranged from 77% to 100%, and the specificity ranged from 74% to 97%. Very variable sensitivities and specificities were found for borrelial antigens of three different VlsE protein IR(6) peptide variants (IR6p1, IR6p2, IR6p4) and three recombinant decorin binding proteins A (DbpA; DbpAIa, DbpA91, DbpAG40). For single antigens, good specificity was shown for antigens of IR6p4 and DbpAIa (96%), while DbpA91, IR6p1 and IR6p2 were moderately specific (88-92%). The analytical sensitivity of the microarray was dependent on the borrelial IgG concentration of the specimen.

Nucleic acid detection from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually the method of choice for the diagnosis of neuroinvasive virus infections, especially for different herpes viruses. However, virus serology from serum and CSF provides complementary information, and plays an important role particularly in prolonged infections, and in the investigation of long-term sequelae. For neuroinvasive M. pneumoniae infections, both nucleic acid detection and serology are generally used, while serology is most sensitive for neuroborreliosis. However, the serodiagnosis of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is generally complicated by the very variable antibody responses observed between individuals and those at the different stages of the disease. Furthermore, the borrelial antibody response may not reflect an infection, but merely a contact with a tick carrying the pathogen. Due to the complex nature of borreliosis, several different diagnostic methods, e.g. enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and immunoblotting, are often used in parallel to obtain more specific and reliable results for diagnosis Lyme borreliosis. In addition, for the serodiagnosis of borrelial infection, it is generally suggested that two specific antigens should react with patient's serum to establish the diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "EIA is the most commonly used platform for the serodiagnosis of neuroinvasive infections, sometimes complemented by e.g. immunoblot.
