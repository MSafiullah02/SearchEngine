Of significant concern, after the spread of the infection outside China, several countries have experienced an exponential rise in the number of identified cases, with Italy now reporting more than 5 times the number of deaths in China and the U.S having surpassed China as the most affected country with over 400,000 identified cases, almost 35% of them in the state of New York, a major epicenters of the disease. The costs of the COVID-19 pandemic have been significant, with marked economic disruption due to the widespread lockdowns for disease containment, increased jobless claims, high likelihood of a global recession and major changes in ordinary social relationships due to the recommended social distancing measures.",

Overall, the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic upon spinal care seems far more meaningful and noticeable. Such a deleterious impact can be traced to several factors such as the reallocation of hospital resources (such as nursing staff and ICU beds) to the care of patients with the coronavirus as well as cancellation of elective surgeries and office visits in order to reduce the chances of disease spread.",

Another associated concern is the possible discharge of postoperative patients to nursing homes, rehabilitation and other long-term care facilities, especially when considering the tragic experience of a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington state, which witnessed a cluster of 35 COVID-19 related deaths [3] among its 120 residents and 180 staff. Finally, from an educational standpoint, it seems important to highlight that the CDC recommendations against gatherings of more than 10 people has also affected the daily routine of surgical training, with grand rounds and multidisciplinary meetings being either cancelled or held virtually. In addition to a possible detrimental effect upon residents training, the associated drop in operative cases due to OR restrictions may also have real implications for their graduation, especially taking into account that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACMGE) has officially released a statement emphasizing that the minimum caseload requirements for trainees in surgical specialties will not be changed",

Moreover, in the same way previous studies have demonstrated that a breakdown in adequate patient-physician relationship may be associated with increased Emergency Department (ED) visits in the perioperative period [5] , the rela-tive lack of access to healthcare resources which is likely being experienced by a significant number of patients may also lead to increased number of unnecessary ED visits as well as increased opioid use. An additional concern is the possibility (or reality) of losing healthcare insurance due to layoffs. This is all the more meaningful as recent reports have estimated that the unemployment rate in the U.S. may be currently around 13% [6] , the highest level since the Great Depression, with an addition of 8.5 million more people to the list of those requiring unemployment benefit just in the past two weeks.",

As illustrated by a recent report in Science, an observational study in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference [9] , approximately 86% of all COVID-19 infections may be undocumented. This suggests that the total number of infections worldwide may be at least one order of magnitude higher than those in the official reports. Another worrisome report was recently released by the Harvard Global Health Institute [10] . Using data on Covid-19 patients, the model compares the amount of necessary hospital and ICU beds in each hypothetical evolution scenario for the pandemic with the actual numbers of beds available on a state-bystate basis. Assuming a hospitalization rate of 19% for those under 65 years and 28.5% for those over 65 years and an 19% ICU rate for those hospitalized under 65 and 28.5% for those over 65, even in the best case scenario (in which 20% of the population would become infected in 6 months) in most states more than 100% of the hospital beds would need to be emptied to provide care for COVID-19 patients. In the moderate scenario, in which 40% of the population would become infected in 6 months, the number of necessary hospital beds would be a staggering 200-500% of the current capacity ( Figure 1 ).",

To achieve such goals, many spine surgeons have provided contributions to their institutions in establishing alternatives modes of care, including the adoption of telemedicine consults for post-operative evaluations and wound checks as well as triage teams to differentiate between urgent and elective referrals and surgeries. Although the specific details of the policy may vary from hospital to hospital, as a general rule any spinal disorder for which a delay of 6 to 8 weeks is not likely to compromise the standard of care, has been considered non-urgent and, therefore, have been temporarily postponed. This still leaves a substantial subgroup of patients with acute or progressive neurological deficits, spinal tumors, spinal infections as well as spinal instability which require proper triage for urgent of emergent attention.",
