The activation of a number of serine proteases, including GzmA and B, is predominately mediated by cathepsin C (CatC). Deficiencies in CatC-null mice were therefore expected to replicate the defects observed in GzmAB-deficient mice. We have previously determined that GzmABdeficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Here, we have compared the ability of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice to control MCMV infection with that of GzmAB-deficient animals. We found that CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice have organspecific defects in the ability to control MCMV replication, a phenotype that is distinct to that observed in GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Significantly, the cytolytic function of CatC-deficient NK cells and CTLs elicited during infection was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells. Hence, CatC is involved in limiting MCMV replication; however, this effect is independent of its role in promoting effector cytolytic activity. These data provide evidence for a novel and unexpected role of CatC during viral infection.",

            "text": "Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells are critical for protecting higher organisms against intracellular pathogens, including viruses. Following the formation of a stable conjugate, major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8 + T cells secrete granule-bound toxins that induce apoptosis in the infected cell. The pore-forming protein perforin (Pfp) coalesces into transmembrane channels that permit access for a family of serine proteases (granzymes, Gzms) to proapoptotic substrates in the target cell cytosol. 1 Pfp, which is encoded by a single copy gene, is critical for granulemediated cytotoxicity, and its deficiency results in severe susceptibility to many viruses, including the poxvirus ectromelia and the herpesvirus cytomegalovirus (CMV). [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] In contrast, deficiency of more than one Gzm (typically both GzmA and GzmB) is required for significant viral susceptibility to become evident in vivo. 4, 7 Given the potency of granule toxins, cytotoxic lymphocytes have unsurprisingly developed strategies to limit their own susceptibility to Gzm-mediated apoptosis. In particular, Gzms are synthesized as zymogens and become activated by the removal of an N-terminal dipeptide only at the time of packaging into secretory vesicles. Cathepsin C (CatC) (dipeptidylpeptidase 1) is known to be the major mediator of pro-Gzm activation, as mice deficient in this enzyme have reduced Gzm activity. 8 CatC is also critical for activation of additional families of serine proteases, including those expressed in mast cells and neutrophils. 9 Recently, we made the surprising observation that the CTLs and NK cells of CatC-deficient mice still retain potent killing capacity. Both in vitro-activated alloreactive CTLs and interleukin (IL-2) activated NK cells from these mice were able to kill target cells more efficiently than cells isolated from mice with genetic deletion of both the GzmA and GzmB genes. 10 In the absence of CatC, we found that GzmA activity was negligible; however, there was sufficient residual GzmB activity to permit significant Pfp-dependent apoptosis to continue. It is therefore likely that proteases other than CatC are also capable of activating pro-GzmB, although with reduced efficiency.",

            "text": "Mouse models have proved very useful to dissect the roles of specific effector pathways in complex immune responses, such as those elicited during viral infection. In particular, infection of mice with murine CMV (MCMV) is one of the best systems for this type of analysis. NK cells and CD8 + CTLs are the principal cellular mediators of anti-MCMV activities during acute infection, with NK cells having the main antiviral role in the C57BL/6 mouse strain. 11 NK cells and CTLs deliver most of their cytolytic effects through granule exocytosis. We have previously shown that mice lacking GzmAB display increased susceptibility to MCMV, characterized by higher viral titers in several of the target organs during acute infection. 4 As CatC-deficient mice possess reduced Gzm activity, we set out to investigate how CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice respond to MCMV infection. Surprisingly, we found that although CatC-deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to MCMV infection, this was not as overt as that observed in mice lacking GzmAB. Furthermore, the effector function of both NK cells and antiviral CD8 + CTLs from CatC-deficient mice was equivalent to that of wild-type mice. Thus, CatC has an important role in limiting acute MCMV infection, but this is independent of its function as a proactivator of Gzm A and GzmB cytolytic activity. To our knowledge this is the first evidence that effector cells generated in vivo in response to a viral infection exert their cytolytic functions independently of CatC.",

The phenotype of CatC-deficient mice was proposed to mirror that of GzmAB-null mice as lymphocytes isolated from these animals were found to have minimal amounts of GzmB activity and no detectable GzmA activity. 8 However, alloreactive CTLs and IL-2-activated NK cells isolated from CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were shown to induce apoptosis in target cells as efficiently as wild-type CTL, and, unlike GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, CatC-deficient animals were not susceptible to ectromelia virus infection. 10 These data suggest that despite CatC having a role in the generation of active Gzm, immune effectors in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice may be capable of generating sufficient Gzm activity to kill target cells. However, the lytic activity of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 effectors generated during a physiological response in vivo has not been assessed.",

MCMV replication was assessed in the indicated target organs at days 4 and 10 post infection (p.i.).

Pfp-, GzmAB-and CatC-deficient mice (all on a B6 background) were infected with MCMV and splenocytes isolated 3 days p.i., a time when maximal NK-cell cytotoxic activity is expected. Splenocytes were incubated with 51 Cr-labeled YAC-1 target cells and specific lysis was quantified after 4 h. In agreement with previous reports, 13, 14 Pfp \u00c0/\u00c0 NK cells were unable to lyse sensitive targets ( Figure 3 ). In contrast, CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 NK cells were as effective as wild-type or GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 NK cells in killing YAC-1 target cells ( Figure 3 ). Therefore, deletion of CatC does not impair the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Indeed, the fact that deficiency of both GzmA and GzmB produced no reduction in NK-cell killing indicates that, in this model, NK cell-dependent target cell death involves Pfp-mediated pathways that utilize alternative Gzms or effector proteases.",

As a number of Gzms are involved in antigen processing (reviewed in Zavasnik-Bergant and Turk 15 ), the capacity of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 dendritic cells (DCs) to process exogenous antigen was assessed. Antigen processing was assessed using DQ-ovalbumin (DQ-OVA). DQ-OVA is a self-quenched OVA conjugate that fluoresces only after proteolytic processing. Splenocytes were isolated from na\u00efve B6, CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 or GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and incubated with DQ-OVA at either 37 1C or 4 1C. The incubation at 4 1C provides a control for nonenzymatic processing of DQ-OVA. Splenocytes were then stained with antibodies against CD11c and MHCII, and cells analyzed by FACS. The percentage of DCs (CD11c + MHCII + ) in the spleen was equivalent in all the mouse strains tested (Figure 4a ). Furthermore, processing of DQ-OVA by DCs was equivalent in the three mouse strains ( Figure 4b) . Thus, deletion of CatC or GzmAB does not impair the capacity of DCs to process exogenous antigen.",

Indeed the mean fluorescent intensity of CD11c staining of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 DCs was significantly lower than that of wild-type or GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 DCs (Table 1) . b2-integrins consist of a heterodimer between a unique a-subunit associated with the common b2 chain (CD18). The b2 family is composed of four members: LFA-1 (CD11a/ CD18), Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) and adb2 (CD11d/CD18). 16 The b 2 -integrins are leukocyte-specific proteins that are critical for cell-cell interactions during immune responses. 16 Hence, the reduction in CD11c expression observed on CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 DCs could potentially impact on the capacity of DCs to interact with na\u00efve T cells, thereby inhibiting the generation of the subsequent adaptive response to MCMV. Some support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that CatE-deficient macrophages have a reduced capacity for adhesion correlating with decreased expression of CD18. 17 The ability of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice to generate an effective adaptive antiviral immune response was initially examined by evaluating the expression of b2-integrin proteins on CD8 + T cells. Several studies have determined that expression of both CD11b and CD11c is increased on activated CTL. [18] [19] [20] Following MCMV infection of wild-type or GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 , mice expression of CD11b and CD11c was upregulated on a significant proportion of splenic CD8 + T cells ( Figure 5 and Table 1 ). In contrast, fewer CD8 + T cells upregulated expression of either CD11b or CD11c in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice after MCMV infection ( Figure 5 and Table 1 ). Importantly, expression of CD11a on CD8 + T cells was equivalent in wild-type, GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 and CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 5 and Table 1 ). Thus, deletion of CatC prevents the upregulation of CD11b and CD11c, b2-integrins associated with T-cell activation.",

Although the percentage of CD8 + T cells in the spleens of GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 was equivalent to that of wild-type mice, the absolute number was significantly lower (Figure 6b ). This finding reflects a general loss of splenic cellularity associated with the inability to control MCMV replication in the spleen of GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. 4 Despite the potential for a large pool of virally derived peptides to be presented to CD8 + T cells, the immune response to many viruses is often directed against a few immunodominant epitopes. During the adaptive immune response to MCMV infection in B6 mice, an epitope derived from the M45 viral protein is immunodominant. 21 The expansion of CD8 + T cells directed against M45 was monitored by staining splenic T cells with a fluorescently conjugated M45 tetramer. By day 6 post-MCMV infection, a significant expansion of CD8 + T cells directed against M45 had occurred in wild-type mice (Figures 6c  and d) . Importantly, a similar expansion of M45-specific CD8 + T cells occurred in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, suggesting that the loss of CatC does not impair the capacity to generate antigen-specific T-cell responses. A significant, but lower expansion of M45-specific CD8 + T cells was observed in MCMV-infected GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Figures 6c and d) .",

CD8 + T cells were purified from the spleen of wild-type or relevant knockout mice at day 6 p.i. with MCMV. The capacity of lysates prepared from purified CD8 + T cells to cleave a GzmB-specific substrate was then assessed. Significant GzmB activity was detected in lysates from wild-type CD8 + T cells (Figure 7a ). The specificity of the assay is demonstrated by the finding that no significant cleavage of the substrate occurred when lysates prepared from GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 CD8 + T cells were used (Figure 7a) . Importantly, although the GzmB activity of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 CD8 + T cells is below that found in wild-type cells, active GzmB is clearly present in these cells (Figure 7a) . Thus, although CatC has a role in the production of active GzmB in vivo, other means of processing GzmB into its active form clearly exist. These data are the first to establish that CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 cells have the capacity to produce active GzmB in vivo, in response to infection with a viral pathogen. Expansion of M45-antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 occurred to the same extent as in wild-type mice, implying that this response occurs independently of CatC. However, expression of CD11b and CD11c on the total CD8 + T-cell pool in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was lower than that observed in CD8 + T cells from either wild-type or GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 5 and Table 1 ). Expression of integrins is essential for some aspects of T-cell function, such as homing to sites of inflammation. 19 Hence, although expansion of antigen-specific T cells occurs normally in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, it is possible these cells may be functionally impaired. Furthermore, GzmB activity in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 CD8 + T cells is lower than that of wild-type cells (Figure 7a ). We therefore tested the possibility that the function of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 CD8 + T cells may be impaired; this was achieved by measuring the in vivo CTL response of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Wild-type mice, or the relevant knockout mouse strains, were infected with MCMV. On day 6 p.i., a 1:1 mixture of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled M45 peptide-pulsed target cells and nonpulsed targets were injected into mice. Mice were killed 4 h later, a single-cell suspension prepared from the spleen and the specific loss of M45-pulsed targets determined by FACS analysis. Mice deficient in Pfp were unable to kill M45-pulsed target cells (Figure 7b ). In contrast, CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 and GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were as efficient as wild-type mice in clearing M45-peptide-pulsed targets in the spleen (Figure 7b) . Similarly, the clearance of peptide-pulsed targets in the liver of MCMV-infected CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 or GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was equivalent to that of wild-type mice (Figure 7c ). Together these data demonstrate that CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are capable of generating functional antiviral CD8 + T-cell responses in vivo. Figure 5 Upregulation of CD11b and CD11c on CD8 T + cells is impaired in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. B6, B6.CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 and B6.GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were infected with 5\u00c210 3 PFU MCMV-K181-Perth and splenocytes isolated 6 days p.i. Expression of the b2-integrins CD11a, CD11b and CD11c on CD8 + T cells was determined by FACS analysis. The percentages of CD8 + T cells positive for the various b2-integrins are shown. Two independent experiments were performed with three mice per group, representative plots are shown.",

We found that NK cells and CTL from MCMV-infected CatC-deficient mice were as effective as wild-type B6 effectors in killing sensitive targets in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CD8 + T cells isolated from MCMV-infected CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice contain active GzmB.

Indeed, independent studies have reported that cytotoxic effector cells from GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice efficiently lyse various target cells. 13, 17, 24 Thus, there is an apparent discrepancy between the ex vivo killing efficiency of GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 effectors, which is equivalent to that of wild-type cells, and the inability of GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 mice to control MCMV replication in the spleen. Although GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 effectors are capable of killing target cells, the type of cell death induced is distinct from that induced by wild-type effector cells. 13, 14 Hence, it is possible that the killing of MCMV-infected cells in vivo may require a specific form of cell death that GzmAB \u00c0/\u00c0 effectors are incapable of inducing. Alternatively, the Gzms may have a role in inhibiting some aspect of viral replication completely independently of their role as mediators of cell death. For example, the TSP-1 proteinase secreted by CTL is able to inactivate the reverse transcriptase derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus. 25 Similarly, GzmB activity prevents the reactivation of HSV-1 by degrading the ICP4 immediate early protein in neurons without inducing apoptosis, 26 and GzmH inhibits replication of adenovirus by cleaving a virally encoded DNA binding protein. 27 Therefore, there is increasing evidence that Gzms have noncytotoxic activities that may contribute to the control of viral infections. Surprisingly, viral replication in the liver of CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was significantly higher than that observed in wild-type B6 mice, despite the fact that CatC-deficient mice could control MCMV infection in the spleen and the lungs. CatC has a role in the activation of neutrophil serine proteases, including neutrophil elastase. 9, 12 It was, therefore, plausible that the increased viral replication observed in CatC-deficient mice might have been the result of impaired neutrophil function. Our studies however showed that depletion of neutrophils does not lead to an increase in viral titers and does not recapitulate the inability to control viral replication observed in target organs of CatCdeficient mice. These data provide evidence, although indirect, that the phenotype observed in CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice after MCMV infection does not relate to a defect in neutrophil function.",

This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that CatC \u00c0/\u00c0 mice retain residual GzmB activity, but have no GzmA activity. 10 Alternatively, some of the antiviral effects of CatC may be totally independent of its role as a proactivator of Gzms. The Cat family of endosomal proteases has been implicated in the proteolytic processing of several viruses. In the majority of instances described to date the Cats participate in activities that favour viral replication. For example, CatB and CatL are required for the efficient entry of Ebola and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus into host cells. 29, 30 Here, we describe an antiviral role for CatC. Previous studies excluded a role for CatC in controlling infection with ectromelia virus. 10 It is worth noting that ectromelia virus and CMV are viral pathogens with very distinct characteristics. Although ectromelia is a highly cytopathic virus which kills the cells it infects, the primary targets of MCMV infection in vivo, macrophages and DCs are not killed by viral infection. 31 Furthermore, the control of the ectromelia and MCMV in vivo relies on Gzm and Pfp to differing degrees; both Pfp-and GzmAB-deficient mice succumb to infection with ectromelia, 2 whereas only Pfp-deficient, but not GzmAB-deficient mice die after MCMV infection. 4 It is therefore not unexpected that the role of CatC may be different in different viral infections. It is possible that the proteolytic activities of CatC may be utilized to various degrees by the host as a means to impede viral replication by interfering, for example, with appropriate viral assembly. This is an exciting possibility worthy of further investigation.",

Importantly, this role of CatC is independent of its known functions as an activator of Gzm A and GzmB cytolytic activity or neutrophil elastase function. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show in vivo, in a physiological setting of viral infection that the lytic function of NK cells and CTL is not affected by the absence of CatC.",

The in vivo CTL assay quantifies CTL activity by measuring the loss of specific peptidepulsed targets in comparison with targets that have not been pulsed with peptide. Here, target cell lysis was measured using a modification of the previously described in vivo CTL assay. 34 M45 peptide-pulsed (0.02 mg ml \u00c01 ) splenocyte targets were labeled with a low concentration (final (0.025 mM)) of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes), whereas control targets not pulsed with peptide were labeled with a high concentration (final (0.25 mM)) of CFSE. Labeled cells were washed to remove free CFSE and differential labeling confirmed by flow cytometry. CFSE-low M45-pulsed targets and CFSE-high unpulsed control targets were resuspended in PBS, mixed in equal proportions, and a total of 4\u00c210 7 cells per mouse transferred intravenously into syngeneic mice that had been infected with MCMV for various periods of time. Mice were killed 4 h later and single-cell suspensions from spleen analyzed by flow cytometry. Transferred cells serve as targets for peptide-specific CTL. The frequency of unpulsed targets serves as an internal control for trafficking, recovery and nonspecific cell loss. The loss of specific peptide-pulsed targets is a measure of CTL activity against targets pulsed with the M45 viral peptide. Specific lysis was determined using the following formula: Percentage specific lysis of CFSE-labeled target cells in each mouse is calculated as follows: (1\u00c0(r uninfected control mouse/r infected test mouse)) \u00c2 100 where r\u00bcfrequency of unpulsed targets/frequency of peptide\u00c0pulsed targets.
