In Singapore, several agencies coordinated their efforts to quickly bring the outbreak under control. The current breed of health-care information systems (HCIS) was not sufficient to handle new information-sharing needs during the crisis. In this paper, we take a look at the measures taken during the crisis in Singapore through a knowledge integration perspective. This perspective reveals interesting implications for HCIS.",

While cost reduction and quality of health care rightly share a majority of the focus, changes in the world are rapidly exposing us to new potential dangers such as the virus strain that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in many regions in Asia and Canada, which is potentially only the first such danger in this century [4] .",

The management of health-care emergencies is more so, and is a complex process which has to be tackled on various fronts [7] , [8] . To compound the process, the strain was a new virus, leaving people in the dark as to how the virus spreads and what measures may or may not be effective. In Singapore, early measures put in place effective mechanisms to detect suspected cases of SARS, isolate, and treat them to prevent escalation of the crisis. Immediately upon realizing close contact as a cause for transmission of the disease, many initiatives were taken to manage the crisis. Manuscript Contact-tracing of confirmed SARS cases was carried out, suspected cases were quarantined, and social support was provided to those affected, through various grassroots agencies. Various agencies from the Ministry of Health (MOH) to the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) were involved in attempting to contain the spread of the infection. This process meant effective coordination and dissemination of current and useful information to various agencies. Information flow, key to effective management of a crisis [7] , was also a key issue in the SARS outbreak. Hospitals and various health-care institutions were the battlegrounds where management of this crisis had to be effected. Health-care information systems (HCIS) had to share information effectively to help manage this battleground. Though Singapore already utilizes several strategic applications of IT among health-care institutions [9] , the SARS outbreak posed new challenges which needed to be addressed. Since existing HCIS are generally not designed to cater to new needs [1] , when the crisis escalated, Singapore developed and deployed an information system in two weeks to help manage data and various related operations during the crisis. In Toronto, where information flow was also recognized as necessary to manage the SARS outbreak, such rapid development and deployment of information systems could only be hoped for and post-its were used to manage contact-tracing operations [10] .",

Developments in the Internet, enterprise-grade decision support, and mobile technologies underpin many of the advancements in health-care IT [14] . However, the implementation of disease-related groups and disease-management programs to manage health-care costs and medical insurance is leading to greater need for advanced IT in health care.
