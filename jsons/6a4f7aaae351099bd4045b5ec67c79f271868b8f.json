Methods A retrospective study of 100 COVID-19 pneumonia patients without ARDS was performed, and CT scans were reviewed. A COVID-19 pneumonia course diagram was drawn. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the lesion distribution and CT scores, \u03c7 2 test was used to compare the CT findings between different stages. Results A total of 272 CT scans from 100 patients (mean age, 52.3 years \u00b1 13.1) were investigated. Four patients with lung abnormalities on CT first showed negative RT-PCR result and turned positive afterwards. One hundred sixty-nine (62.1%) showed predominantly peripheral distribution. The CT scores of the upper zone (3.4 \u00b1 3.6) were significantly lower than those of the middle (5.0 \u00b1 3.9) and lower (4.8 \u00b1 3.6) zones (p < 0.001). The CT scores of the anterior zones (4.9 \u00b1 4.7) were significantly lower than those of the posterior zones (8.4 \u00b1 6.2) (p < 0.001). In the early rapid progressive stage (1~7 days), ground glass opacity (GGO) plus reticular pattern (58.1%), GGO plus consolidation (43.0%), and GGO (41.9%) were all common. In the advanced stage (8~14 days), GGO plus consolidation (79.8%) and repairing CT signs (subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips) showed a significant increase (p < 0.05). In the absorption stage, GGO plus consolidation (9.1%) sharply decreased (p < 0.05). Conclusion CT imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia showed a predominantly peripheral, middle and lower, and posterior distribution. The early rapid progressive stage is 1~7 days from symptom onset, the advanced stage with peak levels of abnormalities on CT is 8~14 days, and the abnormalities started to improve after 14 days.",

Different from both the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 is a brand new member of enveloped RNA coronaviruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily) infecting humans [2] . Although the majority of cases were reported to be related to the Huanan Seafood Market, the source of the virus is still unclear [3] . The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020 [1] . As of 11 p.m. on February 15, 2020, Chinese authorities have reported 56,563 confirmed cases and 8969 suspected cases, including 1524 deaths in mainland China. Among them, Wuhan City has the largest number of 34,256 confirmed cases with 1123 deaths [4] . In addition, 515 cases have been confirmed in other countries all over the world. There is increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission in hospitals and among family members; the rate of severe cases was reported to have reached 26%, and the mortality rate has reached 4.3% by the latest study [5] . Asymptomatic infectious individuals can also be a source of infection according to the latest version of the guidelines [6] . A previous study [7] indicated CT has a higher sensitivity (97%) than RT-PCR results (30-60%) for COVID-19 pneumonia. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, CT is especially important for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and the judgment of the degree of disease. Although several studies have described the CT imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia [8] [9] [10] , so far, there is still a lack of large-sample CT imaging studies and followup observation. In this study, we collected 100 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients, including 84 cases with CT follow-up scan, to describe the CT imaging features and evolution of this disease.",

Finally, each lung was divided into 6 zones altogether, namely the upper anterior zone, the upper posterior zone, the middle anterior zone, the middle posterior zone, the lower anterior zone, and the lower posterior zone. The involvement scale in each lung zone was scored based on the following criteria: score 0 (no involvement), score 1 (< 25% involvement), score 2 (25% to less than 50% involvement), score 3 (50% to less than 75% involvement), and score 4 (> 75% involvement).

Several previous studies [8, 10, [15] [16] [17] have described the main CT signs of COVID-19, summarized as GGO, crazypaving pattern, and consolidation. We found 13 signs on CT imaging altogether, which were partially similar to the previous study but more comprehensive and detailed, including GGO, consolidation, GGO plus consolidation, GGO plus reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, microvascular dilation, air bronchogram, subpleural transparent line, thickening of the pleura, pleural retraction, pleural effusion, subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips, taking into account the signs inside the lesions (vacuole sign, microvascular dilation, air bronchogram) and the sign of pleural involvement. Also, we found that the lung abnormalities tended to be predominantly distributed in the peripheral zone, middle and lower zone, and posterior zone in bilateral lungs. The peripheral distribution may be due to the fact that the virus is more likely to invade bronchioles and alveoli, causing inflammatory reactions which need the participation of immune cells; the distribution of blood vessels and lymphatics rich in immune cells is more abundant in the peripheral and lower areas, so the lesions tended to distribute in the peripheral and lower area of the lungs.",

As the disease progressed, both the parenchyma and interstitium involvement evolved, manifested as the intensity of the previous abnormalities increasing, GGO turned into GGO plus reticular pattern, and GGO plus reticular pattern turned into consolidation, so the vacuolar sign was the most prominent in this advanced stage; also, pleural effusion developed in a small proportion of the cases. The vacuolar sign may be due to the inhomogeneous involvement and incomplete filling of alveoli, it was characteristic especially during the advanced stage. Meanwhile, some lesions began to absorb. The intensity of the previous abnormalities decreased; GGO plus consolidation, consolidation, and GGO plus reticular pattern all decreased, and the repairing signs continued increasing, including the subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips.

We found the CT findings of these 4 patients were similar to the other cases, indicating that CT scan was more sensitive than RT-PCR results; this finding was consistent with some previous reports [7] . A representative case is shown in Fig. 6 . This phenomenon is also mentioned in a recent case report [18] . This may be related to the viral load of the lower respiratory tract secretion in patients with a different course of disease, or nonstandard sampling operation for pharyngeal swab, or it may be related to the existence of a certain degree of false-negative rate of the RT-PCR test. This suggested that CT may be more sensitive and detect lesions earlier than the present RT-PCR test for COVID-19 nucleic acid. This also suggested that there may be a proportion of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with negative COVID-19 nucleic acid result when lung abnormalities already existed on CT imaging; the establishment of diagnostic criteria should take these patients into account.",
