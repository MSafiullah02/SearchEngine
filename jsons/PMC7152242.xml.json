However, since first being reported in 1957, the virus has been found in other areas of India including the Kutch and Saurashtra parts of Gujarat state, Andaman Islands and West Bengal. It is estimated that close to 500 cases of KFD occur in India every year and, from 2003 to 2012, among 823 confirmed cases, 28 were fatal.",

The disease attack rates reported were 0.15% (14/9072) among persons receiving one dose and 0.047% (10/21,083) among recipients of two doses, respectively, compared to an attack rate of 0.870% (325/37,373) in unvaccinated persons, for vaccine efficacies of 82.4% and 94.8%, respectively.14 The vaccine was subsequently commercialized and is produced by the state Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Hebbal, Bangalore, and has been central to KFD prevention efforts in the state of Karnataka. Annual vaccinations have been done since 1990 in the Shimoga and adjacent districts wherein two doses of the vaccine were administered in individuals 7 to 65 years of age at an interval of 1 month. Periodic boosters were also administered after 6 to 9 months.",

The etiologic agent eluded investigators until 1976, when a novel bunyavirus, HTN virus was isolated from the striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, which proved to be the principal viral reservoir in most areas of Asia. Later, antigenically related SEO virus was isolated from Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus, explaining the occurrence of sporadic HFRS cases and outbreaks in urban areas. Subsequently, Sin Nombre and related hantaviruses were discovered in the Western hemisphere, where rare encounters with infected rodents lead to small numbers of cases that feature prominent pulmonary involvement. A multitude of hantaviruses now have been described globally.",

Nor is there a regional public health presence as in Latin America, where the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) leads regional vaccination programs and also provides central purchasing of certain qualified vaccines. However, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN; includes Brunei-Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) in 1992 initiated efforts for a subregional regulatory harmonization scheme to reduce differences in technical requirements and regulatory procedures for pharmaceuticals.30 A 1999 harmonization initiative, under auspices of a Pharmaceutical Product Working Group, aimed to remove barriers to regional commerce and to eliminate technical barriers to trade without compromising product quality, efficacy, and safety. Eventually, a subregional central or mutual-recognition procedure similar to that of the European Union could be envisioned. Importantly, local clinical trials are not required for registration under abbreviated pathways specified by the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier if the vaccine was approved and licensed by a benchmark regulatory agency, resulting in a certificate of pharmaceutical product. By contrast, the national regulatory authorities of China, India, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have required local clinical trials before or after registration, and in other countries, while data in local populations may not be required for registration, those data are important in deliberations on a vaccine's inclusion in the national schedule. For dengue, a disease of special public health urgency regionally, the global debut of candidate vaccines in the region is being considered, with individual country vaccine registrations ahead of approval by a benchmark agency and provision of a certificate of pharmaceutical product. The initiative is a collaboration among the nongovernmental organizations, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Developing Countries Vaccine Regulatory Network (DCVRN). The WHO through the DCVRN has been actively working toward harmonizing procedures in affiliated countries, including China, India, and Indonesia, to bring those regulators under the WHO prequalification umbrella and to facilitate approval and supply of their products for Gavi and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).31\n",

Studies of antibody responses to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Asia, for example, have found higher prevaccination and postvaccination antibody titers among Philippine and Taiwanese infants compared with European or historical control subjects, and in Korea, a considerably higher proportion of subjects were seropositive to meningococcal serogroup W135 polysaccharide at baseline than in the United States.32, 33, 34 While the basis for these differences may be an earlier exposure in life to cognate or cross-reacting antigens (e.g., because of regional differences in host microbiomes), genetically restricted responses, as have been observed with HepB, measles, vaccinia, rubella, Hib, and other antigens, or, in the case of oral rotavirus vaccine, in genetically determined viral attachment or receptor binding molecules, have been described.35, 36, 37, 38 From the perspective of adverse events following immunization, the example of narcolepsy occurring in some recipients of an adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine illustrates the role of genetic background as a cofactor in risk.",

In China, the introduction of an internationally registered and otherwise widely used product nevertheless necessitates recapitulating the entire clinical development program in China, including Phase I studies, despite an abundance of previously scrutinized evidence. This requirement introduces a delay of a decade or more for registration of internationally developed, as opposed to domestically developed, vaccines. Specifications in national pharmacopeias that deviate from established compendia, for example, exclusion of well-accepted excipients or methods, also have seriously impeded or prevented registration of foreign products or, when imposed with a revision of the pharmacopeia, have led to withdrawal of a previously registered product. Clinical trial processes also have hindered local introduction of established or novel products (e.g., a 2013 Indian Supreme Court ordered suspension of ongoing clinical trials and reexamination of previously approved trials was followed by a wholesale revision of clinical trial guidelines, leading to a temporary cessation of all industry-sponsored clinical trial activity). The potential inclusion of video recording of the informed consent process, newer insurance requirements and further proposed but unclear amendments to the Drug and Cosmetics Act that could impose criminal penalties against trial investigators for poorly defined violations may further limit trial activity.39 China and Indonesia place severe restrictions on the exportation of clinical samples from study subjects, thereby requiring that validated laboratories and procedures are established locally, adding a barrier that has led to delays of or avoidance of clinical studies in those countries. Whether resulting from inexperience, a dearth of trained personnel, trade protection, or other reasons, administrative mechanisms in various countries in the region have had the effect of delaying the registration of proven vaccines that otherwise could have prevented significant morbidity and mortality with more timely introductions.",

A reliable supply of inexpensive diphtheria and tetanus toxoids combined with whole-cell pertussis (DTwP)-Hib-HepB combination vaccines, made possible largely by Indian and Korean manufacturers, has facilitated the introduction of Hib antigen into schedules of economically disadvantaged countries that otherwise would not have adopted the monovalent vaccine. Similarly, provision of measles and measles containing vaccine by Indian manufacturers was key to the elimination of that disease in Latin America and the current state of polio elimination could not have been achieved without supplies from Asian regional manufacturers. The provision of oral cholera vaccine for outbreak control in Haiti, Pakistan and other countries is an important example of the increasing ability of and global dependence on these manufacturers.",

The recommendation process is even lengthier than appearances suggest, as the Immunization Policy and Vaccination Committee does not convene a deliberative vaccine working group until after the product is registered, unlike the parallel activities of the U.S. ACIP and Food and Drug Administration.

For new, often costly vaccines, phased introduction provides a mechanism to accommodate their full EPI coverage costs over time.

As vaccines generally are available free in public clinics, even in affluent countries, families may obtain them in government clinics or hospitals (e.g., in Singapore, \u224860% of families obtain vaccines through the government system of polyclinics and hospitals). However, to avoid long waiting times and rotating staff at public clinics, many families opt to obtain these otherwise free vaccines privately and to pay out-of-pocket at pediatric, general practitioner, or other private clinics. In addition, as newer vaccines may be delayed in their introduction to the national reimbursement scheme, it is common for parents to pay voluntarily for these vaccines (see earlier). As might be expected from the distribution of income, the proportion of children vaccinated in government primary health centers is higher in rural areas. Overall, approximately 90% of children in Thailand and 70% in Malaysia are vaccinated through public channels.

Between 2005 and 2025, the birth cohort of Asia will decrease slightly from 76.1 to 72.2 million, and the population of children 0 to 4 years old will hold nearly constant while the number and proportion of adults from 15 to 64 years will increase dramatically, and the number of people older than 65 years of age will nearly double, from 250.6 to 480.6 million. A demographic crossover point with more adults 60+ years of age than children younger than 15 years of age was reached in Europe in the 1990s, and will occur within another generation in Asia (Fig. 75.2\n).46 With the exception of almost universal EPI programs of tetanus toxoid vaccination of pregnant women, adult vaccination has been viewed mainly in the context of travel, as in group A meningococcal vaccine for the Hajj, and in tropical Asia, influenza vaccine for travelers to temperate locations. However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic H1N1 outbreaks and the regional threat of H5N1 influenza have focused attention on routine seasonal influenza vaccination for the first time in many countries, beginning with elderly populations, and the role of children in influenza transmission is being recognized while it is rediscovered in Japan. As a result of high pediatric vaccination coverage in developed countries in the region, JE has become almost exclusively a disease of adults older than 45 years of age, reflecting the intrinsic biological susceptibility of older adults to neurotropic flaviviruses and suggesting a future need for adult vaccination.47 Hepatitis A, interestingly, is now principally a risk in the cohort of young adults who were raised in an era of economic development and improved sanitation and who therefore lack natural immunity but were born before routine childhood vaccination was implemented.48 A catch-up program to address this epidemiological shift has been recognized by adult vaccination recommendations in some countries (see Table 75.3). In China, adult measles vaccination is under discussion, as more than 100,000 cases have occurred annually in recent years, in equal proportion in adults older than 20 years and in infants who had not received their first vaccine dose. Growing awareness of adult vaccination is reflected in an increasing number of countries with adult vaccination recommendations (see Table 75.3).",

Urban crowding is likely to affect the transmission patterns of certain person-to-person transmitted diseases and even of infections acquired from environmental sources. Dengue, for example, is transmitted by mosquito vectors that are more prevalent in urban environments; the already great need for a dengue vaccine will almost certainly increase with the growth of urban centers.49 While the growing size and number of large cities may increase transmission of certain infections, delivery of vaccine and of healthcare in general is better organized in cities than in rural areas. Specific interventions are needed to ensure that the existing disparity in access to healthcare between urban and rural dwellers does not widen.",

While vaccines are regarded by many as a public good to be provided as a government service, as mentioned, access to the increasing number of new vaccines is likely to be stratified by income level and ability to pay, as governments must choose among increasingly costly vaccines and other health interventions. As shown in Table 75.1, pediatric societies in a number of countries promulgate recommendations emulating those of the U.S. ACIP, and these schedules, aimed at practitioners serving private-paying families, may diverge increasingly from the national EPI schedules benefiting the majority of children in those countries.

Governments and ASEAN have expressed increased interest in providing for national and regional vaccine security. The collaboration of industry sponsors with nongovernmental organizations and government in public private partnerships for new product development has been highlighted by the successful introduction of vaccines and drugs for several neglected diseases, for which the DCVMN view a responsibility. For example, the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Kitasato Daiichi Sankyo provided technical assistance to establish domestic measles-rubella vaccine production in Vietnam's public corporation, Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals, POLYVAC. At the same time, the entry of nongovernmental organizations as actual sponsors of novel vaccine development for certain target diseases introduces competition with DCVMN manufacturers and multinational companies that might also consider similar development programs. Asian academic institutions and companies possess elements of the scientific and technical expertise needed to develop vaccines for current and emergent needs and, seemingly, the will to establish themselves on the global stage and contribute to their development. Regional institutions responded rapidly to threats of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus and Ebola virus with candidate vaccine development even when transmission was geographically remote. Further participation of regional institutions in global responses in the future is likely.",

As important, compliance with international standards will be required of regional manufacturers hoping to license locally developed vaccines more broadly.

Many countries lack the laboratory capacity to test samples for lot release, and because manufacturing and testing technologies change rapidly, keeping up with new procedures and purchasing needed equipment are ongoing challenges. Continuous support also is needed to produce working quantities of reference standards, validation of new assays, staff training, and proficiency testing. As resources are unavailable in many countries to establish and maintain a fully functioning national control laboratory, a regional network has been proposed as an approach to share expertise and to divide workload, while at the same time standardizing methods and criteria. Field surveillance of adverse events following immunization is another area requiring strengthening. Investigations of adjuvanted H1N1 and H5N1 pandemic and prepandemic vaccines administered in Korea and Taiwan, respectively, illustrated the interest in and epidemiological capacity of local investigators but also the limitations of existing systems and databases. Japan is establishing a database of clinical encounters that if linked to immunization records could be used as a future adverse events surveillance system.",
