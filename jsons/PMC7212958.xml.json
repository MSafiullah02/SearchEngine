Given the hospital strain during the pandemic, resource availability for non-emergent procedures was also limited. This included, but was not limited to, decreased operating room availability for cancer surgery, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement, esophageal dilation/stent placement, dental evaluation and extraction, infusion services, physical and occupational therapy, and home care services.

Despite social distancing, use of telehealth, conversion to shorter fractionation schedules, and deferment of some treatments, there are numerous patient touchpoints with the radiation care team. By nature of radiation treatments, patients are physically present within the department and interacting with team members often on a daily basis. Especially as other members of the patient\u2019s multidisciplinary care team reduce in-person interactions, the radiation care team has become the main point of interaction. This proximity should be leveraged to aggressively and preemptively manage patients during treatment.",

Therefore, as a faculty, we decided that a proactive, intensive approach to on-treatment management of at-risk patients was necessary to maintain excellent disease outcomes while avoiding health system strain. We developed these guidelines using our combined experience, knowledge of the literature, and consensus. We have implemented these on-treatment guidelines in our clinics beginning April 13, 2020.",

By establishing a prioritization system to defer some patients, we have counterbalanced the volume of interactions throughout the department on any given day.

In this resource-constrained environment, we must adapt our management of radiation patients to reduce their risk of hospitalization. Our faculty convened to set priorities for patient treatment, and to develop consensus guidelines for intensive on-treatment management of at-risk disease sites, typically those undergoing curative-intent radiation therapy with concomitant chemotherapy.
