A core genome threshold of 1 2 4 0.99, MCL inflation parameter of 1.5, and a modified core diversity cutoff for branch lengths 1 2 5 above 0.001 were used alongside the default parameters. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (6). PROVEAN was used to predict the 1 2 8 functional effects of amino acid substitutions (7). ExPASy and PROSPER were used for motif 1 2 9 scanning and protease site prediction, respectively (8, 9) . The Immune epitope database analysis 1 3 0 resource (IEDB-AR) was used for epitopes prediction using a 0.5 threshold and default settings 1 3 1 (10).
