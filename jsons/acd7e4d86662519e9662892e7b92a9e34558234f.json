Human viral hepatitis has continued to be of major concern to public health authorities because of its relative high rate of incidence throughout the world.' The disease is generally regarded as being at least two entities, Type A (infectious) hepatitis and Type B (serum) hepatitis, caused by separate, as yet not fully characterized, viruses. It is unfortunate that despite the severe public health problem of these diseases, experimental systems that could be used to evaluate potential chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of hepatitis are virtually nonexistent.",

Biochemical studies have indicated that ribavirin may exert its antiviral effect as the 5'-monophosphate by inhibiting enzymes involved in guanosine monophosphate synthesis.a0 The drug is readily converted to the 5'-phosphate in the liver and spleen, presumably by adenosine kinase. Such an active involvement of the liver and spleen in the drug's metabolism suggests its possible utility for therapy of hepatitis, since these organs are of primary importance in the early replication of murine hepatitis viruses.\" Oxford2' has reported evidence for ribavirin's inhibition of structural and nonstructural polypeptides and antigens of influenza virus, which may be an alternative mechanism of action for the drug against MHV as well.",
