On that day, the Ct values on real-time PCR for the N gene and Orf1ab gene were 18.8 and 18.6, respectively, while urine and stool samples remained negative (2) . No one apart from HCWs with full PPE had contact with the infant during the admission. Synthetic fiber flocked swabs with Universal Transport Medium were used to sample the infant's bedding; the cot rail; a table situated 1 meter away from the infant's bed; and the HCW's face shield, N95 mask, and waterproof gown (6 swabs in total) (Figure) . The infant's bedding, the cot rail, and a table situated 1 meter away (all 3 environment samples) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene Ct values for the bedding, cot, and table were 28.7, 33.3, and 29.7, respectively. Similar SARS-CoV-2 E gene Ct trend values were detected from the environment in terms of distance from the infant (Figure) . All 3 samples from the HCW's PPE were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2.",

Although our infant had no respiratory symptoms, the nearby environment could have been contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 through crying or drooling. There was a downward trend of viral load with increasing distance from the infant (from bedding to cot rail). However, the Ct values at the table 1 meter away from the cot indicated higher viral load. For droplet transmission, one would expect the viral load in the environment to fall with increasing distance from the immobile infant. However, baby formula and other items, such as baby wipes, were placed on it. Therefore, it seems more likely that the contamination was due to indirect contact via HCW hands between baby and table. These findings suggests that even generally well infants positive for SARS-COV-2 with no respiratory symptoms can easily contaminate nearby environments. Our data also reaffirm the importance of hand hygiene when caring for infants with COVID-19 and potentially in helping to reduce environmental virus contamination. ",
