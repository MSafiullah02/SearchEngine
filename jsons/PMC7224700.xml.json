These function to coordinate the regulated release of neurotransmitters as well as the cellular machinery that maintains the function and integrity of presynaptic boutons and thus neuronal communication (Rangaraju et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017). The post-mitotic nature of neurons and their long lifetimes likely contributes to their vulnerability to various kinds of stress (Bishop et al., 2010) often culminating in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and neuronal degeneration as clearance systems become exhausted. Recent studies point to the presence of several proteostatic mechanisms within or near synapses that function to remove non-functional and/or damaged proteins. These include the proteasome, the endo-lysosomal system and autophagy (Hoffmann et al., 2019; Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015; Lazarevic et al., 2011; Vijayan and Verstreken, 2017; Wang et al., 2017). Genetic or environmental insults to these clearance systems cannot only disrupt synaptic transmission but also trigger developmental and neurodegenerative disorders (Liang and Sigrist, 2018; Vijayan and Verstreken, 2017; Waites et al., 2013).",

One tagging system involved in protein quality control is the ubiquitination system, which attaches specific ubiquitin chains to a substrate, potentially leading to its degradation through either the proteasome or the lysosome. In addition, recent evidence suggests that ubiquitination plays an essential role in the generation of autophagic structures (Ciechanover and Kwon, 2017; Deng et al., 2017).",

E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which mammalian cells express several hundred (Li et al., 2008), are posited to be responsible for substrate and degradation pathway specificity (Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017). For example, K63-poly-ubiquitinated proteins can be recognized by the autophagy adaptor p62, leading to the engulfment of these proteins into autophagy organelles and their subsequent delivery to the lysosome (Linares et al., 2013). On the other hand, K48-poly-ubiquitinated proteins are generally recruited into the proteasome for degradation (Ji and Kwon, 2017).",

Additionally, the knockdown of two multi-domain scaffold proteins at the active zone (AZ), Piccolo and Bassoon, led to the loss of SVs and overall synapse integrity (Okerlund et al., 2017; Waites et al., 2013). This dramatic effect was caused in part by the activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah1 (Waites et al., 2013). Intriguingly, hippocampal neurons from mice lacking Bassoon alone show a robust increase in autophagosomes throughout axons and within synapses (Okerlund et al., 2017). These findings suggest that Bassoon is a potent regulator of presynaptic proteostasis, to some extent through the scaffolding constituents of the autophagy pathway such as Atg5 (Okerlund et al., 2017).",

            "text": "At present, it is unclear which E3 ligases are critical for enhanced presynaptic autophagy observed in the absence of Bassoon as well as which presynaptic proteins ultimately become degraded when the autophagy system is activated. In this study, we sought to address several questions. Specifically, what is the cargo of autophagy induced by the lack of Bassoon? Is the ubiquitin system involved in the substrate tagging and delivery in Bassoon knockout (Bsn KO) mice? And which E3 ligases are required to drive Bassoon deficiency-triggered autophagy? Regarding the latter, we focused our studies on two ligases, the RING-type E3 ligase Siah1 and the RING-between-RING-type (RBR-type) E3 ligase Parkin, as both are known to ubiquitinate several SV-associated and other presynaptic proteins (Chung et al., 2001; Trempe et al., 2009; Wheeler et al., 2002). Parkin is particularly attractive, given its association with several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson\u2019s disease (Corti et al., 2011; Nixon, 2013). Moreover, Parkin is well known for being involved in mitophagy, the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (Ashrafi et al., 2014; Pickrell and Youle, 2015) and to generate K63-poly-ubiquitinated substrates (Olzmann et al., 2007) that can be degraded by autophagy (Linares et al., 2013). Our analysis reveals that Bassoon deficiency-triggered presynaptic autophagy requires the ubiquitin system, which primarily ubiquitinates SV proteins through the activation of Parkin and to a lesser extent Siah1. Overactivation of this system has a negative impact on SV recycling and pool size, suggesting a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin in SV clearance.",

Our previous study identified the presynaptic active zone proteins Bassoon and Piccolo as key regulators of SV proteostasis as well as synaptic integrity (Okerlund et al., 2017; Waites et al., 2013). We could also show that Bassoon was involved in the local regulation of autophagy within presynaptic boutons in part by scaffolding the autophagy protein Atg5 (Okerlund et al., 2017), and that ROS-mediated damage of SV proteins can trigger their clearance via autophagy (Hoffmann et al., 2019). Conceptually, presynaptic autophagy could be trigged by the generation of ubiquitinated substrates (Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017), or via the activation of signaling systems that e.g. inactivate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Codogno et al., 2012; Hernandez et al., 2012; Klionsky et al., 2012). At present, it is unclear whether Bassoon deficiency-induced autophagy is controlled by either or both. If the latter, one might anticipate that Bassoon loss of function only creates empty phagophore membranes, while the former should also trigger the creation of ubiquitinated substrates. Clearly the identification of such substrates could help to unravel the cellular program regulated by Bassoon, for instance whether it controls the catabolism of SV or other synaptic proteins.",

            "text": "Given that the N-terminal zinc fingers of Bassoon are known to bind and inhibit the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah1 (Waites et al., 2013), we designed a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that Bassoon loss of function promotes autophagy by increasing the production of ubiquitinated substrates via specific E3 ligases. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we explored whether the expression of the two N-terminal zinc fingers (ZnFs) of Bassoon could suppress autophagy in neurons lacking Bassoon. This was accomplished by lentivirally expressing a construct with the first 609 amino acids of the Bassoon protein including ZnF1 and ZnF2 (Bsn609) tagged with eGFP in cultured hippocampal neurons from both WT and Bsn KO mice. As reported previously (Dresbach et al., 2003), Bsn609-eGFP properly localizes to the synapse (Figure 1B, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A). Co-transduction with RFP-LC3 in this and following experiments allowed for the monitoring of autophagy and a staining with antibodies against Synaptophysin1 was used to label synapses. In Bsn KO neurons, the introduction of FU-Bsn609-eGFP reduces the number of RFP-LC3 puncta per axon unit length back to WT levels (Figure 1A,B and C). Strikingly, the number of Synaptophysin1 puncta was significantly increased when FU-Bsn609-eGFP was expressed in Bsn KO neurons (Figure 1A,B and D). These findings are in line with Waites et al., 2013, showing that the expression of the Bassoon ZnFs could increase the intensity of SV2-eGFP at synapses in neurons expressing either shRNAs against both Piccolo and Bassoon or scrambled shRNA controls (Waites et al., 2013).",

Although the endogenous ubiquitin is still present, this manipulation was sufficient to reduce the number of RFP-LC3 puncta (Figure 2A,B and C) and the colocalization of RFP-LC3 with Synaptophysin1 (Figure 2A,B and E) in Bsn KO neurons back to WT levels. Furthermore, we observed that inhibiting the E1 activating enzyme, by treatment of Bsn KO neurons with ziram (Chou et al., 2008; Rinetti and Schweizer, 2010), also reduces presynaptic autophagy levels back to control levels (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C). These findings make a strong case that Bassoon may normally function to negatively regulate synaptic autophagy through its ability to inhibit enzymes involved in ubiquitination and/or poly-ubiquitination such as Siah1 (Waites et al., 2013).",

To test this concept, we quantified the synaptic levels of two SV proteins, SV2b and Vamp2, exhibiting increased ubiquitination in Bsn KO synaptosomes (Figure 3). Indeed, both SV2b and Vamp2 levels were reduced in Bsn KO neurons compared to WT neurons (Figure 4A,D,B and E). This effect was abolished by treating cultures with 1 \u03bcM of the autophagy inhibitor wortmannin (Klionsky et al., 2012; Ravikumar et al., 2010; Figure 4A,D,B and E), indicating that the loss of SV2b and Vamp2 in Bsn-deficient neurons is autophagy-dependent. To further strengthen these results, we performed similar experiments with SAR405, a highly specific Vps34 inhibitor (Ronan et al., 2014), to block autophagy. As expected, the treatment prevented autophagy induction as well as the decrease of SV2b levels in Bsn KO neurons (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1).",

Both concepts could lead to an altered vesicle cycle function. Given that fluorophore-conjugated Synaptotagmin1 antibodies label SVs that underwent an exo-/endocytosis cycle (Hoopmann et al., 2010; Truckenbrodt et al., 2018), the amount of Synaptotagmin1 antibody uptake (Syt1 uptake) can be used as a measure of vesicle cycle efficiency under the assumption that the total amount of Synaptotagmin1 is unchanged. In a control experiment, there were no overt changes in Synaptotagmin1 levels in Bsn KO compared to WT neurons (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A and B) indicating that Syt1 uptake can be used as a measure of SV cycling. Interestingly, in Bsn KO neurons, we observed that the amount of activity-associated Syt1 uptake was significantly reduced. This could be rescued to WT levels by treating cultures with wortmannin, indicating that the reduced recycling of SVs in Bsn KO neurons is associated with increased autophagy (Figure 4C and F). Strikingly, the treatment with wortmannin alone in the WT background leads to a slight increase in Syt1 uptake (Figure 4C and F). This suggests that the acute inhibition of autophagy can increase SV cycles by itself, though the mechanism is unclear.",

Given the presynaptic localization of Bassoon and the ubiquitination of presynaptic proteins (Figure 3), we hypothesized that autophagosomes are being formed locally at the presynaptic terminal to engulf SV-related cargos. To explore this hypothesis, we used cryo-electron microscopy (EM) to quantify the presence of double-membraned autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in WT and Bsn KO boutons, as described previously (Hoffmann et al., 2019). Consistent with our studies using fluorescent microscopy (Okerlund et al., 2017), significantly more AVs per presynaptic bouton were detected in Bsn KO compared to WT neurons (Figure 5A and C). This effect was rescued by the addition of wortmannin (Figure 5A,B and C). Intriguingly, AVs filled with SV-sized vesicles were observed in Bsn KO samples, indicating a possible wholesale removal of SVs (Figure 5A, zoom). In contrast, we could detect only small but not significant differences in the number of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Figure 5A,B and D), a hallmark of the endo-lysosomal pathway (Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). These data provide compelling evidence that Bassoon-regulated ubiquitination of integral presynaptic membrane proteins leads to their clearance through autophagy rather than the endo-lysosomal system.",

Consistent with this concept, we observed that treating neurons with wortmannin to inhibit autophagy prior to EM processing increased the number of SVs per terminal area in Bsn KO and WT neurons (Figure 5A,B and E) further supporting the argument that autophagy plays a role in the maintenance of SVs within presynaptic boutons.",

Previous studies have shown that the induction of autophagy through the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine is able to expand the lifespan of various animal models (Eisenberg et al., 2009). Along these lines, we posited that the increased autophagy in boutons lacking Bassoon would not only increase the rate of SV clearance but also lead to an overall younger pool of SV proteins. Given that SV2 levels are substantially lower in Bsn KO boutons, we explored whether this is related to increased protein turnover and accordingly a shift in the age of SV2 molecules. This was accomplished by creating a fusion protein between SV2 and a recombinant version of GFP that changes its emission from blue to red with time (Subach et al., 2009). For these studies, we chose a medium fluorescent timer (Subach et al., 2009) (mFT-SV2) that changes its fluorescence with a maximum of blue intensity after 21 hr and a maximum of red intensity after 197 hr. Hippocampal neurons from Bsn KO and WT animals, expressing FU-mFT-SV2, show a punctate pattern of both red and blue fluorescence (Figure 6). Quantifying the ratio between old (red) and young (blue) SV2, we were able to detect a significant decrease of the red/blue ratio in Bsn KO compared to WT neurons (Figure 6A and B). This difference is also visible in frequency histograms (Figure 6C). These data indicate that indeed the SV2 pool is shifted towards younger proteins in Bsn-deficient synapses.",

An open question is which E3 ubiquitin ligase might be critical for these Bassoon-dependent phenotypes. Our previous studies of neurons lacking both Bassoon and Piccolo revealed that Siah1 was an important E3 ligase controlling SV pool size, but perhaps not elevated autophagy in these cells (Okerlund et al., 2017). In revisiting this problem, we initially sought to confirm these results in hippocampal neurons from Bsn KO mice. This was accomplished by first verifying in immunoblot analyses that the previously reported shRNAs against Siah1 (shSiah1) efficiently knocked down Siah1 (Okerlund et al., 2017; Waites et al., 2013). In these new experiments, we observed that when ~ 80% of hippocampal neurons were infected with FU-shSiah1, Siah1 levels decreased to ~50% (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A and C), indicating that the shRNA is indeed functional. To ensure that any change in autophagy is cell-autonomous and associated with the down regulation of Siah1, Bsn KO neurons were either singly or double infected with lentiviruses expressing RFP-LC3, a reporter for autophagy, and FU-shSiah1. Using the soluble eGFP in FU-shSiah1 to identify shSiah1-expressing axons, we observed that reducing Siah1 levels by ~50% was not sufficient to reduce the number of RFP-LC3 puncta present along the axons of neurons lacking Bassoon (Figure 7A,B and C). Intriguingly, it slightly reduces the percentage of RFP-LC3 puncta that colocalized with Synaptophysin1 (Figure 7A,B and E) indicating that Siah1 does play a role in Bassoon deficiency-triggered autophagy within presynaptic boutons.",

In western blots, our Parkin shRNA (shParkin) was able to reduce Parkin protein levels in infected neurons by ~70% (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B and D). It also dramatically reduced the number of RFP-LC3 puncta per 10 \u03bcm axon (Figure 8A,B and C) as well as the colocalization of RFP-LC3 and Synaptophysin1 puncta (Figure 8A,B and E, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E) to WT levels.

In this study, we investigate mechanisms regulating the turnover of SV proteins using the loss of the AZ protein Bassoon as a driver of local autophagy (Okerlund et al., 2017). Specifically, our data suggest that Bassoon negatively regulates ubiquitination of a number of SV proteins and that the enhanced ubiquitination of presynaptic proteins is a potent driver of presynaptic autophagy in Bsn-deficient neurons, leading to smaller pools of SVs with apparently younger proteins. Our findings also suggest that two E3 ligases, Siah1 and Parkin, become overactive in boutons lacking Bassoon and contribute to the enhanced clearance of SV proteins via the autophagy degradative system, implying that they normally operate to remove non-functional proteins, a feature compromised in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

These include data showing that blocking poly-ubiquitination by the over-expression of UbK0 (Figure 2; Okerlund et al., 2017; Waites et al., 2013) or the addition of the E1 inhibitor ziram (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1; Chou et al., 2008; Rinetti and Schweizer, 2010) suppresses autophagy in boutons lacking Bassoon (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). Moreover, over-expressing the amino-terminal ZnFs of Bassoon, known to bind and inhibit the activity of the E3 ligase Siah1 (Waites et al., 2013) not only suppressed autophagy in Bsn KO neurons, but restored the number of Synaptophysin1 puncta (Figure 1). Furthermore, knocking down either Siah1 or Parkin, two E3 ubiquitin ligases known to ubiquitinate SV-associated and other presynaptic proteins (Chung et al., 2001; Huynh et al., 2003; Kabayama et al., 2017; Martinez et al., 2017; Sassone et al., 2017; Trempe et al., 2009; Wheeler et al., 2002), also impaired the induction of autophagy in Bsn KO neurons (Figures 7 and 8). Intriguingly, while the loss of Bassoon function leads to the selective activation of autophagy and reduction in SV pool size, synapse integrity is not compromised (Figure 5). This is in stark contrasts to the situation in neurons, in which the expression of both Bassoon and Piccolo are reduced. Here, not only SV pools are drastically reduced, but also synaptic integrity is disrupted (Okerlund et al., 2017; Waites et al., 2013). This later situation also involves enhanced poly-ubiquitination of presynaptic proteins and the overactivation of the E3 ligase Siah1 (Okerlund et al., 2017; Waites et al., 2013). This additional effect seems to be attributable to loss of Piccolo function, which was recently shown to regulate the maintenance of SV pools through Rab5 and Rab7, components of the endo-lysosomal system (Ackermann et al., 2019).",

These data revealed a remarkable 2- to 4-fold increase in ubiquitination levels of several SV proteins when Bassoon is depleted (Figure 3). Levels of ubiquitinated postsynaptic proteins such as SynGAP were not changed in these mice, supporting earlier conclusions that Bassoon is regulating autophagy and/or ubiquitination on a local presynaptic level (Okerlund et al., 2017). One limitation of our mass spectrometry findings is that we cannot distinguish between mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination, nor can we identify which lysine residues in the ubiquitin poly-peptide are used to create longer ubiquitin chains. Given the high variety of how poly-ubiquitin molecules can be attached to any given substrate (Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017), we cannot discriminate whether mainly changes in K63- or K48-poly-ubiquitination do occur. For instance, while Synaptagmin1 is highly ubiquitinated in Bsn KO neurons, this modification did not lead to a significant loss of protein (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B), making it particularly important to study more synaptic proteins and their unique ubiquitination patterns in future studies.",

Given the cytoplasmic location of the ubiquitin machinery (Hoffmann et al., 2019), one can anticipate that loss of Bassoon function increases the poly-ubiquitination on cytoplasmic sites of various SV proteins. Consistently, we found that the ubiquitinated residues on each analyzed peptide occurred on the cytoplasmic site of the corresponding protein (Figure 3). For example, the ubiquitination sites on SV2a and SV2b (SV2a143 and SV2b333) were located on their cytoplasmic tails (Bartholome et al., 2017), further strengthening our hypothesis that the observed ubiquitination of SV proteins tags them for degradation. Additionally, we could detect ubiquitinated peptides from E2N, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, known to be involved in K63-poly-ubiquitination (David et al., 2010). This suggests that the absence of Bassoon selectively activates E2N, which then transfers ubiquitin to substrates in the context of specific E3 ligases, a concept that supports our hypothesis that the autophagy phenotype in Bsn KO neurons is attributable to increased K63-ubiquitination.",

Thus, a fundamental question raised by our study is whether increasing autophagy through Bassoon loss of function also leads to the clearance of SV proteins. Light level quantification of SV2b and Vamp2 revealed a significant decrease of both proteins (Figure 4) in Bsn KO neurons in an autophagy-dependent manner. Similarly, the appearance of autophagic vacuoles containing ~50 nm vesicles as assessed by cryo-EM and loss of SVs in Bsn KO boutons (Figure 5) makes a strong argument that SV proteins or even whole SVs can enter the autophagic pathway for their clearance. The latter observation is not surprising, as the knockdown of Bassoon in a Piccolo KO mouse model drives the loss of SVs in boutons of cortical cultures as well (Mukherjee et al., 2010). These findings are consistent with previous data showing a severe reduction of eGFP-SV2 intensities in the boutons lacking Bassoon and Piccolo (Okerlund et al., 2017; Waites et al., 2013) and further indicate that (ubiquitinated) SV proteins could become cargo of Bassoon deficiency-triggered autophagy.",

            "text": "Another important question raised by our study is which degradative system is preferentially turned on in our model system? Given that inhibition of the proteasome induces autophagy to compensate for the reduced clearance of soluble proteins (Ding et al., 2007) and that autophagosomes can fuse with endosomes (Klionsky et al., 2014), it becomes clear that these three degradative pathways are strongly co-regulated to ensure synaptic health (Lamark and Johansen, 2010; Lilienbaum, 2013; Vijayan and Verstreken, 2017). This interdependence makes it difficult to distinguish the contribution of any one of them. To meet this challenge, we quantified the presence of both AVs as a measure of autophagy (Ericsson, 1969; Klionsky et al., 2012) and MVBs as a measure of the endo-lysosomal machinery (Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009) per presynaptic terminal in WT and Bsn KO neurons. Here, we could detect an increase of AVs in Bsn KO neurons, with no profound changes in the number of MVBs (Figure 5). This suggests that Bassoon deficiency regulates the clearance of synaptic proteins primarily through the autophagy rather than the endo-lysosomal system. At present, we cannot rule out potential roles for Bassoon in other degradative pathways such as the proteasomal or the endo-lysosomal system; an interesting topic for future studies.",

A follow-up study revealed that the loss of both active zone proteins also triggered the induction of autophagy, but found no strong evidence that this required Siah1 (Okerlund et al., 2017), perhaps because this condition activated multiple E3 ligases generating ubiquitinated substrates that promote autophagy independent of Siah1. The subsequent finding that Bassoon, rather than Piccolo, was a local active zone regulator of autophagy, allowed us in the present study to revisit the question of whether substrates generated by Siah1 promote presynaptic autophagy in the absence of Bassoon. Here, we found a significant reduction in presynaptic autophagosomes, identified with RFP-LC3 colocalizing with Synaptophysin1, in neurons with a 50% reduction in the expression of Siah1. But, this manipulation did not significantly affect the total pool of autophagosomes that appeared in axons (Figure 7), suggesting either that the 50% reduction of Siah1 is not sufficient to block its activity or that other ubiquitin ligases may contribute to this phenotype. The data also indicate that Siah1-mediated ubiquitination of SV proteins, such as Synaptophysin (Wheeler et al., 2002), may contribute to the elimination of SV proteins through other degradative systems.",

            "text": "Importantly, our studies show that the RBR-type E3 ligase Parkin is required for elevated autophagy levels in Bsn KO mice (Figure 8). Parkin not only plays an important role in mitophagy (Ashrafi et al., 2014; Pickrell and Youle, 2015) but it can also generate K63-poly-ubiquitinated substrates in general (Olzmann et al., 2007). Another study showed that, in Drosophila neurons, Parkin strongly mediates K6- and K63-poly-ubiquitination (Martinez et al., 2017). Increased K6-ubiquitination through Parkin could be explained by the fact that Parkin auto-ubiquitinates itself via K6-ubiquitin for stability regulation (Durcan et al., 2014). Besides being involved in mitophagy, there have been reports that Parkin ubiquitinates several substrates that are abundant at the synapse, such as Synphilin-1 (Chung et al., 2001), Synaptotagmin11 (Huynh et al., 2003), Synaptotagmin4 (Kabayama et al., 2017), CDCrel-1 (Zhang et al., 2000), Syntaxin5 (Martinez et al., 2017) and Endophilin-A (Murdoch et al., 2016; Trempe et al., 2009). Intriguingly, our mass spectrometry analysis revealed a strong increase in the ubiquitinated Parkin substrate Synaptotagmin11 (Figure 3). We further identified increased ubiquitination in other SV proteins (SV2, Vamp2, Synaptotagmin1) as well as components of the SNARE SV fusion complex (SNAP25 and Syntaxin1b), raising the possibility that they are also substrates for Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. Future studies will help resolve these possibilities. Recently, it has also been shown that Parkin can be activated independently of the mitophagy-related PINK1 protein (Balasubramaniam et al., 2019). The significant rescue of synaptic autophagy with shParkin and the observation that Parkin is involved in ubiquitination of several synaptic proteins strongly suggest that Parkin is involved in autophagy induced by the absence of Bassoon.",

Given that total Synaptotagmin1 levels are not changed, the reduction in the Synaptotagmin1 antibody uptake driven by endogenous network activity observed in Bsn KO neurons can be either caused by the decrease of total SV number (Figure 5), by the contribution of Bassoon to SV release (Altrock et al., 2003) or reloading into release sites (Hallermann et al., 2010), or its role in the recruitment of voltage-dependent CaV2.1 channels to the presynaptic membrane (Davydova et al., 2014). Alternatively, exocytosis could be impaired by the removal of the highly ubiquitinated SNARE proteins, SNAP25 and Syntaxin1b (Figure 3). Together these data provide strong evidence that Parkin is one of the major E3 ligases that are required for Bassoon deficiency-triggered SV autophagy. An open question is how Bassoon influences Parkin activity. As for Siah1 (Waites et al., 2013), we have performed various biochemical studies to assess whether Bassoon directly interacts with Parkin. However, such an interaction was not detectable in immunoprecipitation experiments performed with either full-length recombinant Bassoon or various of its subdomains (data not shown). Nonetheless, both proteins could be part of a larger assembly, in which Bassoon regulates Parkin activity. Alternatively, the absence of Bassoon could trigger indirectly pathways that enhance Parkin activity. Future experiments will have to address these issues.",

Clearly, the overactivation of this system by the loss of Bassoon can have adverse effects on the function of presynaptic boutons, arguing that a balanced regulation is necessary to maintain the functional integrity of SV and other presynaptic proteins. Future studies investigating Parkin\u2019s role in SV degradation would be worthwhile given its strong involvement in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (Nixon, 2013; Pickrell and Youle, 2015).",

            "text": "Importantly, the data presented here raise several fundamental questions regarding the contribution of other degradative systems, such as the proteasome and the endo-lysosomal system, to the maintenance of presynaptic proteostasis. Previous studies have shown that the proteasome can utilize specific E3 ligase such as SCRAPPER or Fbxo45 to mediate the removal of specific AZ proteins such as RIM1 and Munc13, sculpting the efficiency of synaptic transmission (Jiang et al., 2010; Speese et al., 2003; Tada et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2007; Yi and Ehlers, 2005). Evidence has also emerged that homeostatic activity-dependent changes in synaptic function engage the endo-lysosomal system for the removal of subsets of SV proteins (Jin et al., 2018; Sheehan et al., 2016). It has also been found that nutrient starvation can trigger the degradation of a broad range of neuronal as well as synaptic proteins to reduce metabolic demand for cells during periods of stress (Catanese et al., 2018). This suggests that these degradative systems function in synchrony to modulate the composition of synaptic proteins to a broad range of physiological conditions. Less clear is whether there is functional redundancy within these systems that can compensate for the loss of one, during for example neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that regulate each will be critical to sorting this out. Based on our observations concerning Parkin, we can anticipate that though there are approximately 600 different E3 ligases, each can likely operate in unique ways and on different substrates depending on the microenvironment.",

Afterwards, cell suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min after which the supernatant was transferred into a new tube. Subsequently, the protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Synaptosomes were prepared as described previously (Smalla et al., 2013). In brief, brains were homogenized in homogenization buffer (5 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 320 mM sucrose and protease inhibitor cOmplete Tablets 1x), centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min and the pellet re-homogenized before an additional 10 min at 1,000 g. The supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. Subsequently, the pellet was re-homogenized in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min resulting in the membrane fraction P2. Afterwards, the P2 fraction in 5 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.1 containing 320 mM sucrose was loaded on a sucrose density step gradient (0.85M, 1.0M, 1.2M). Subcellular fractionation was achieved by centrifugation at 85,000 g for 2 hr. Synaptosomes were harvested from the 1.0/1.2M interface. Next, protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Sigma-Aldrich), sucrose was removed by two centrifugation steps at 100,000 g for 30 min each and the resulting pellet was solubilized in an appropriate volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer.",
