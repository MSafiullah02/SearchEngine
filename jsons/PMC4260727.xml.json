Levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation were substantial, but lower than that in the cells treated with arsenite, an inducer of UPR/ISR used as a positive control. As eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation usually leads to an increased translation of ATF4 mRNA, the data suggest that the ISR/ATF4 pathway may contribute to the response induced by the dysfunctional ETC complex III.",

The expression of the above ATF4 target genes (except ASNS) either returned to control levels (CHOP) or even dropped further below (CHAC1, SLC7A11, TRIB3). After 17 h of myxothiazol treatment, the upregulated ASNS mRNA levels also decreased from 3.6-fold at 5 h to 1.5-fold. Apparently, the changes observed following ETC inhibition could not be explained simply by the UPR/ISR gene expression program. To clarify this point, the effect of complex III inhibition on ATF4 mRNA levels at different time points was examined by RT-qPCR analysis. We observed a time-dependent change in ATF4 mRNA level in HCT116 (Figure 2a), RKO (Supplementary Figure S1a) and HeLa (Supplementary Figure S2a) cell lines. Following myxothiazol treatment, the levels of ATF4 mRNA were increased at an early time point (4 h) and then dropped below the control level (16 h). A similar time dependence (but sometimes shifted toward later time points) was obtained for the selected ATF4 transcriptional targets DDIT3/CHOP, TRIB3, SLC7A11 and CHAC1 (Figures 2 b\u2013d, f; Supplementary Figure S1 b\u2013d, f; Supplementary Figure S2 b\u2013d). Therefore, the RT-qPCR analysis has confirmed the mRNA- seq results and has shown that the suppression of ATF4 in response to a sustained ETC complex III inhibition was not cell-line specific. Besides, western analysis has shown that following myxothiazol treatment, the ATF4 protein levels were also increased at early time points (3\u20135 h) and then dropped to (16 h) or below (24 h) the control levels (Supplementary Figure S1h).",

As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, we were able to decrease the myxothiazol-induced expression of ATF4 mRNA by >80% using two separate shRNA targeting its different regions of ATF4 mRNA, compared with a scrambled shRNA control. Next, we examined the expression of ATF4-regulated genes in RKO cells treated with myxothiazol for 4 h. There was a significant suppression of the myxothiazol-induced expression of TRIB3, ASNS and SLC7A11 (but not DDIT3/CHOP) in the ATF4 knockdown sublines (Supplementary Figure S3). These data indicate that the induction of TRIB3, ASNS and SLC7A11 expression in response to a short exposure to myxothiazol depends strongly on ATF4.

            "text": "As the induction of p53 coincided with the downregulation of ATF4, we checked whether a prevention of the p53 activation could restore the elevated ATF4 expression. As the inhibition of complex III induces activation of p53 because of the impairment of pyrimidine biosynthesis,8 we tested whether a replenishment of pyrimidine nucleotide pools abrogates the myxothiazol-induced inhibition of ATF4 expression. The mRNA-seq and RT-qPCR analyses were performed after treatment of HCT116 cells with myxothiazol in the presence of uridine, which is a precursor of uridylic and cytidylic nucleotides. Indeed, the co-supplementation of HCT116 cells with uridine completely abolished the myxothiazol-induced accumulation of p53 (Figure 4a) and the elevated expression of the p53 target gene TP53INP1 (Figure 4b). The functional clustering among the upregulated genes after treatment with myxothiazol plus uridine for 13 h has shown an enrichment with transcripts encoding proteins involved in translation (FDR 0.0025) and the ribosome pathway (FDR 0.05), as it was observed after myxothiazol treatment for 5 h. Also, in the presence of uridine, there was no enrichment with transcripts involved in the p53 signaling pathway. The mRNA-Seq (Table 1) and RT-qPCR data (Figure 4c, Supplementary Figure S4c) indicate that the supplementation of HCT116 or RKO cells with uridine largely reversed the ATF4 mRNA downregulation after prolonged exposure to myxothiazol. When the cells were treated with myxothiazol in the presence of uridine, there was also an upregulation of the ATF4 target genes TRIB3, SLC7A11 and ASNS (Figure 4d and f,Supplementary Figure S4 d\u2013f). Besides, the uridine supplementation without myxothiazol did not affect mRNA levels for ATF4 and its downstream targets (Figure 4). Collectively, the results indicate that although uridine itself does not stimulate the expression of ATF4, it blocks the activation of p53 and prevents the ATF4 mRNA downregulation in response to a sustained inhibition of complex III.",

Nutlin-3 is known to stabilize p53 and activate transcription of p53 target genes.11 Indeed, we observed a substantial accumulation of p53 in response to Nutlin-3, an induction of TP53INP1 transcripts (Figures 5a and b) and a twofold decrease in ATF4 mRNA levels (Figure 5c). Although after a short treatment with myxothiazol (before p53 activation) the expression of ATF4 and its target genes ASNS, TRIB3 and SLC7A11 was increased, it was either reduced (ATF4, ASNS) or unchanged (TRIB3, SLC7A11) if the cells were pre-treated with Nutlin-3 (Figures 5c and d, Supplementary Figure S5 a\u2013e). The difference seems to be due to p53-activation, because in the p53 knockout HCT116 cells treated with myxothiazol, the expression of ATF4 and its target genes was increased independent of the Nutlin-3 pretreatment (Figure 5e, Supplementary Figure S5 a\u2013e). We conclude that p53 activation prevents the induction of ATF4 by ETC complex III inhibition.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that the switch from upregulation to downregulation of ATF4-dependent transcription after a sustained inhibition of complex III can be prevented by a supplementation with uridine that abolishes the induction of p53. We decided to identify the set of genes with a similar regulation mode based on the mRNA-seq data. We selected 131 genes (Supplementary Table S1) that show upregulation after the treatment with myxothiazol for 5 h, or with myxothiazol plus uridine for 13 h (when p53 is not activated), but do not increase after the treatment with myxothiazol alone for 13 h (when p53 is induced), and performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis. We included to the list 34 additional genes whose expression was upregulated in all treated samples, but reliably decreased after the treatment for 13 h with myxothiazol with no uridine supplementation, in comparison to the expression of the same genes after treatment for 13 h with myxothiazol plus uridine (Supplementary Table S2). The functional clustering among the combined gene list has revealed enrichment with transcripts encoding proteins involved in the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (FDR 0.0789) and in the transmembrane amino acid transporter activity (FDR 0.0299) as well as the genes involved in regulation of biosynthetic processes. As it was shown recently by analysis of the ChIP-Seq data, the biological functions of the most significantly enriched ATF4 target genes involve protein biosynthesis (including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases), amino acid transport and amino acid biosynthesis.10 By comparing the list of ATF4 target genes based on the published ChIP-seq analysis10 with the list of genes obtained in this work (165 genes, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), we found that all six aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and six of seven transmembrane amino acid transporters from our gene list correspond to the known ATF4 target genes. Altogether, besides the above-described 5 ATF4 target genes tested by RT-qPCR in our study, 30 additional previously identified ATF4 target genes were found to be upregulated by myxothiazol in the absence of p53 activation (Table 2). The results strongly argue for the repressor activity of p53 against the ATF4-dependent gene expression and provide the list of genes for a search of potential new ATF4 transcription targets.",

The cells were treated with myxothiazol for 24 h in the absence and in the presence of uridine, and the activity of effector caspases was measured in cell lysates. Treatment with myxothiazol did not induce ATF4 transcripts in these cells (Figure 6a). In agreement with our previous results,8, 12 the treatment induced apoptosis and led to approximately threefold increase in caspase-3/7 activity (Figure 6b). We used this value as a positive control. As expected,12 uridine completely prevented the activation of caspases-3/7 in the cells with normal ATF4 levels, but a substantial activity of caspase-3/7 (73\u201376% of the positive control) was observed in the cells with ATF4 knockdown (Figure 6b).

First, the downregulation of ATF4 coincides with the p53 activation. Second, the abolishment of p53 activation by uridine supplementation prevents the inhibition of ATF4 mRNA expression at later time points of complex III inhibition. Third, pre-activation of p53 with Nutlin-3 results in the downregulation of ATF4 mRNA and prevents the induction of ATF4 mRNA in response to a short-term inhibition of complex III.

It suggests that this kind of mitochondrial dysfunction may be associated with amino acid deficiency. Mitochondrial ETC inhibition results in a shortage of energy (ATP), activation of glycolysis and glucose deficiency. Cancer cells may use amino acids as an alternative energy source under glucose deprivation.21 The reduced amino acid pools were shown to lead to protein kinase GCN2 activation, eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 induction to compensate the amino acid deficiency. The activation of GCN2-ATF4-ASNS pathway promotes the survival of cancer cells under nutrient deprivation.21 We suggest that the GCN2-eIF2\u03b1\u2212ATF4 pathway may be also activated in response to complex III inhibition. The assumption is consistent with the report showing that the GCN2-ATF4 pathway is induced by the ATP-synthase (complex V) inhibitor oligomycin.22 However, signals engaged in the upregulation of ATF4 mRNA in response to ETC inhibition are yet to be identified.",

Besides the known pro-apoptotic activities of p53, the mechanism includes the shutdown of ATF4 transcription. This switch of gene expression programs can be prevented by uridine supplementation that abolishes the induction of p53, restores the ATF4-mediated gene expression and enforces the ATF4-dependent long-term cell survival (Figure 6). Therefore, the cross-talk between ATF4 and p53 plays an important role in deciding cell fate in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. Apparently, energy deficiency per se that occurs following an inhibition of respiratory chain is not recognized as a grave hazard. To help the cell to recover from the stress, the ATF4 survival mechanisms are being induced. However, a specific inhibition of complex III that is directly involved in de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines represents a real hazard for genetic stability. Therefore, upon depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides pools, the p53 tumor suppressor jumps in and induces suicidal programs that involve not only different branches of the p53-dependent pro-apoptotic programs but also the shut-off of pro-survival activities of ATF4.",
