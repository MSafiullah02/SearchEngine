This very efficient process of posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), which involves numerous cellular proteins besides the RNA, is strongly conserved in eukaryotes and presumably serves as a protection against viruses and genetic instability arising from mobile genetic elements such as transposons. It was originally observed in plants, [1] but correctly described for the first time in the late 1990s for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

In a first step, the endonuclease Dicer processes the long dsRNA into small or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which are around 21 nucleotides long, of which 19 nucleotides form a helix and 2 nucleotides on each of the 3' ends are unpaired (Figure 1 A) . The actual effector of the RNAi is the ribonucleoprotein complex RISC (RNAinduced silencing complex), which is guided by the siRNA to the complementary target RNA. As a result, the target RNA is cleaved at a specific site in the center of the duplex, 10 nucleotides from the 5' end of the siRNA strand. [6] The catalytic component that cleaves the target RNA (slicer activity), has been identified as the protein designated Argonaut 2 (Ago2). [7] An analysis of its crystal structure showed that Ago2 contains a domain which resembles RNase H, [8] a long-known protein that cleaves the RNA component of a DNA/RNA duplex. After cleavage, the target RNA lacks those elements which are typically responsible for stabilizing mRNAs, namely the 5' end cap and the poly-A tail at the 3' end, so that the cleaved mRNA is rapidly degraded by RNases and the coded protein can no longer be synthesized.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 181, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 813, "end": 816, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 953, "end": 956, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1057, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 495, "end": 507, "text": "(Figure 1 A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ".

The dsRNA is interpreted by these cells as a pathogen, and protein kinase R is activated, which terminates protein synthesis in the affected cells. [13] Furthermore, enzymes are induced which produce 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates and thereby cause an RNase l-dependent unspecific degradation of single-stranded RNA. [14] Since the INF response is only triggered by dsRNAs which are longer than 30 nucleotides, [15] the realization that RNAi is induced by RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides [6, 16] provided a solution to the problem: With their groundbreaking work that chemically synthesized 21-mer siRNAs trigger RNAi in mammalian cells, Tuschl and co-workers opened the way to use RNAi for experiments in mammalian cells. [17] This created new opportunities, not only for research, but also for therapeutic treatments.

Antisense oligo-nucleotides have been employed for the last 30 years to inhibit the expression of genes at the mRNA level. Antisense and RNAi strategies have many things in common, such as the necessity to identify suitable binding sequences on the target RNA, the stabilization of the oligonucleotide by chemical modification, or the transport of the negatively charged polymer across the cell membrane. Experience in the antisense field allowed for very rapid progress to be made with the new RNAi strategy. [19] There are, however, important differences between the two technologies: Antisense oligonucleotides are single-stranded (modified) DNA molecules, which primarily induce the cleavage of the target RNA in the cell nucleus by activation of RNase H. In contrast, RNAi is triggered by double-stranded RNA, which functions primarily in the cytoplasm. Ago2, the most important component of the RISC, is localized in the p bodies. [20] As a result, the central steps of RNAi appear to take place in these discrete structures of the cytoplasm. In the case of RNAi, an endogenous cellular pathway is followed, which could explain the high efficiency with which siRNAs are able to inhibit the expression of their target genes. They can be up to 1000 times as efficient as traditional antisense oligonucleotides against the same target molecule. [21, 22] While no particularly important region could be determined for the normally 15-20 nucleotide long antisense oligonucleotides, the seed region (positions 2-8 of the antisense strand, Figure 1 A) is of great importance for siRNAs, since it is presumably here that the interaction with the target RNA begins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 607, "end": 611, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1038, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1449, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1453, "text": "22]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1636, "end": 1644, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "siRNAs for Targeted Inhibition of Gene Expression"}, {"text": "The effects of siRNAs are transient.

[25] The duration of action of an siRNA presumably depends on numerous factors, such as the target organ, the target gene, and the species.

Similar to siRNAs, they also form a ribonucleoprotein complex with Argonaut proteins and bind to their target RNAs. However miRNAs preferentially recognize target sequences in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNAs, and binding often takes place with an incomplete homology, although a perfect base pairing in the previously mentioned seed region (positions 2-8 of the miRNA) forms the core of the interaction.

As a result, the initiation complex cannot be formed. Alternatively, translation could be slowed after initiation or the ribosomes could dissociate prematurely.

The original assumption, that it is not necessary to search for suitable target sequences in the target RNA, [35] proved to be too optimistic. In practice, the efficiency of different siRNAs against the same target RNA varies drastically. [36] Apparently factors intrinsic to the siRNA itself and the characteristics of the target RNA both play a role in silencing. [37] The probability of identifying a very efficient siRNA was significantly increased after it was discovered that both strands of an siRNA or miRNA are not equally likely to be incorporated into a RISC. Instead, the strand with a lower thermodynamic stability (namely, a higher A/T content) at its 5' end is preferred. [38, 39] Thereafter, the molecular basis for this strand asymmetry could be determined. [40] In D. melanogaster, RISC is loaded by a heterodimer of Dicer-2 and the dsRNA-binding protein R2D2. Here, R2D2 binds to the more thermodynamically stable end of the double-stranded RNA and thus determines which strand associates with the RISC as the guide strand. In a detailed study with 180 siRNAs against two different RNA targets, besides the relative stability of the two ends, additional criteria (preference for special bases in certain positions) were identified which are common among the functional siRNAs. [41] In these experiments, however, the significance of each parameter was determined independently of one another. To also take into account synergistic influences of multiple linked parameters, an artificial neuronal network was trained with a dataset of over 2000 siRNAs against 34 different mRNAs (BIOPREDsi-algorithm). [42] An extensive survey of the activity of published siRNAs has shown, however, that there are a number of very active siRNAs which do not correspond to the proposed criteria, while numerous other carefully designed siRNAs are inactive. Recently, even the hypothesis that the relative stability of the two ends has an influence on their efficiency has been called into question. [43] Neither in an experimentally investigated set of different siRNAs nor in a comprehensive analysis of published siRNAs or siRNAs posted to databanks could a correlation between the terminal stability of the siRNA and its silencing activity be found. Other characteristics of the siRNA also possibly play a role. For example, it has been shown that siRNAs whose antisense strands form stable helices at their ends only show a low level of activity.

On the other hand, there was a clear correlation between the local free energy of the siRNA binding region and silencing. We therefore proposed a two-step model to describe the inhibitory efficiency of siRNAs ( Figure 3 ): Initially the thermodynamic characteristics of the siRNA, that is, the relative stability of the two ends, determine the asymmetric incorporation of the two strands into the RISC.

Modifications can often lengthen the half-life of the siRNA in plasma and improve its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Furthermore, new functionalities can be introduced, fluorescent markers or lipophilic groups, for example, which improve cellular uptake. The rapid successful incorporation of chemically modified components can be attributed to the experience gained in the field of antisense technologies. A multitude of modified nucleotides have been employed in the past years for siRNAs, of which several selected examples will be explained here. Further details have been explained extensively in comprehensive review articles.

In this context it is important to remember that the two strands of the siRNA have different functions: while the guide strand is assembled into the RISC and leads the complex to the target RNA, the passenger strand is discarded in loading the RISC.

In this way it is possible to follow the localization of an siRNA with a fluorophore on the 5' end of the passenger strand without having a grave influence on its silencing activity. [59] Furthermore, the cellular penetration of the siRNA can be improved with a lipophilic component such as 12-hydroxylauryl acid or cholesterol (see also Section 5.1.1). [60] The most common modification for the stabilization of antisense oligonucleotides is phosphorothioate DNA, in which an unlinked oxygen atom is substituted by a sulfur atom. Phosphorothioates are very stable with respect to nucleases and are comparatively simple to manufacture. RNA variants of the phosphorothioates ( Figure 4 ) have therefore also been built into siRNAs. These modifications are fundamentally tolerated by the RNAi machinery; however, toxic side effects have been observed when the phosphorothioate content is high.

Blunt-ended siRNAs proved to be suitable when the RNA units and 2'-O-methyl nucleotides alternate in both strands, so that a modified nucleotide is opposite an unmodified one.

A complete modification of an siRNA with LNAs is therefore impossible, but a few LNA monomers can be built into the siRNA without loss of its silencing ability. [62] In a systematic study, the positions of the antisense strand were identified which tolerate the substitution of the RNA nucleotides by an LNA component without loss of activity. [69] The incorporation of LNAs into siRNAs not only increases the nuclease stability, it can also reduce the off-target effects of an siRNA (see Section 4) by inactivating the sense strand and increase the efficiency of siRNAs by improved loading of the RISC.

Usually a vector-expressed shRNA works significantly longer than chemically synthesized siRNA. Plasmids equipped with a resistance gene can be used to select transfected cell lines in which the target gene can be down-regulated for several months. [75] In addition, transgenic animals can be generated in which the gene of interest is permanently inhibited by using shRNA expression vectors. For example, the shRNA expression cassette can be incorporated into embryonic mouse stem cells by electroporation [76] or lentiviral transfer [77] (see Section 5.2.1). A problem of this method is that integration of the transgene is random, so the silencing efficiency can vary considerably depending on the integration site. Furthermore, important cellular genes can be destroyed. For this reason a locus was sought that guaranteed a strong and predictable shRNA expression. The Rosa 26 locus fulfils these requirements and is used to integrate the transgene homologously by recombinase-mediate cassette exchange (RMCE). The knockdown was 80-95 % when there was a single copy of the shRNA-expression cassette in most analyzed organs. [78] An advantage of this procedure relative to conventional knockout techniques is the immense saving in time: The shRNA-expressing animals are available for investigation in around three to four months, while with knockout animals back-crosses that can take up to several years are often necessary before the gene can be deleted from both chromosomes in a genetically defined background. Surprisingly, we have recently observed phenotypic differences between knockout and shRNA-expressing animals. [79] In this study, the function of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1, which plays an important role in pain perception, was investigated in detail. While the reaction of the shRNAexpressing animals was in accordance with published data from TRPV1-knockout animals in most tests, such as capsaicin-induced hypothermia and colitis, and their reaction to a heat stimulus, they showed pronounced differences in the perception of neuropathic pain. While the knockout of TRPV1 had no impact on the perception of neuropathic pain, the mechanical hypersensitivity and allodynia in the shRNA-expressing animals was significantly reduced in comparison to wild-type animals. This finding agrees with results from small molecule receptor antagonists. [80] The cause for the differences in the behavior of knockout and shRNAexpressing animals is not yet fully understood; however, a complete knockout and a partial knockdown appear to lead to differences in compensation mechanisms.

In goat foetuses and bovine blastocysts, RNAi shut off the prion protein (PrP), which aggregates in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).

In this way, a reporter such as GFP or a relevant functional protein can be expressed with the shRNA at the same time. Secondly, polycistronic expression becomes possible, that is, more than one microRNA-type shRNA can be expressed at the same time from a single transcript.

This often results in undesirable side effects when the substance also binds to other structurally similar proteins. Since RNAi applications are based on Watson-Crick base pairing between an oligonucleotide and an RNA, there was hope that undesired side effects played no role when a target sequence that only appears once in the genome was used. In practice, a single mismatch can lead to a complete loss of silencing. [75, 92] More extensive microarray analyses, with which global profiles of gene expression can be created, showed, however, that siRNAs are not completely specific. While initial studies suggested that the so-called off-target effects of siRNAs are dose-dependent and can be avoided by the use of lower concentrations of siRNA, [93] other studies showed that the unspecific effects have a similar dose response to the intended knockdown of the target gene. [94] The identity of as few as eleven nucleotides between the antisense strand of the siRNA and an mRNA can result in the down-regulation of an mRNA which is not the intended target. These off-target effects can have effects on the phenotype, for example, the viability of cells. [95] More recent investigations have shown that it is not the overall identity of an mRNA with the siRNA, but rather the perfect correspondence between parts of the 3'-UTR and the seed region (positions 2-7 or 2-8) of the antisense strand of the siRNA which determines whether gene expression is influenced ( Figure 5 ). [96] In a systematic study the frequency of all 4096 possible hexamers in the 3'-UTR of the transcriptome was investigated. [97] It was shown that some hexamers are rare while others are considerably more common. It became clear in a microarray analysis that siRNAs with common seed regions trigger stronger offtarget effects than those for which there are only a few complementary sequences. This means that off-target effects can be reduced by clever design of the siRNA. Furthermore, the specificity of siRNAs can be reduced through the incorporation of modified nucleotides. It is comparatively easy to completely inactivate the sense strand by modifications so that the danger of off-target regulation can be reduced to a minimum. Changes to the antisense strand are, on the other hand, more challenging since the inhibitory effects on the expression of the target gene must not be influenced. A single 2'-O-methyl substitution on the ribose of the second nucleotide was shown to be enough to significantly reduce off-target effects while maintaining silencing activity ( Figure 5 ).

A complete analysis of the INF-stimulated genes revealed, however, that siRNAs can also activate the interferon system, presumably mediated by protein kinase R. [99] This effect is not specific for siRNAs, but has also been observed for vector-expressed shRNAs. [100] Presumably the Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the helicases RIG-1 and Mda5, in addition to protein kinase R, also play an important role in the recognition of siRNAs by the immune system. Three members of the TLR family recognize RNA and can trigger an immune response through a complex signaling pathway ( Figure 6 ). It could be shown for plasmacytoid dendritic cells that siRNAs induce INF-a via TLR7. [101] The activating effects of the siRNAs on endosomal TLRs is dependent on the sequence of the siRNA. [102] As a result, motifs could be identified which led to a strong induction of the immune response. This means that immunostimulation can be circumvented by avoiding the use of these motives in an siRNA. For special applications, such as the treatment of viral infections or cancer, strongly immunomodulatory siRNAs which have two functions, knockdown of the target gene and induction of interferons, could be used deliberately.

The investigation of the anti-angiogenetic effects of siRNAs, which are used, for example, in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (see Section 6.3.1), showed in an animal model that unspecific siRNAs without homologous sequences in the mammalian genome were just as efficient as siRNA against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or its receptor. [105] These effects were not dependent on a sequence-specific silencing of the target, nor were offtarget RNAi nor INF-a/b activated.

For both the polio virus [158] and HIV, [159] cases have been described in which viral replication can at the beginning be blocked efficiently, but after a while the virus titer increases again, because of the selection of mutants which can overcome the inhibition. Nonessential genes-for example, the nef gene of HIV-1-can be deleted. [160] Usually, however, viruses overcome RNAi-mediated silencing with point mutations in the target sequence. A comprehensive analysis of 500 HIV-1 mutants showed that certain positions are preferentially mutated. [161] To avoid viral escape, siRNAs should be directed against strongly conserved regions of the virus. Nonstructural proteins will be more severely affected by mutations than capsid proteins. It has, however, been reported that substitutions often result in silent mutations which do not affect protein function. [162] This escape route of the virus can be hindered by selecting conserved regions with a structural function which is destroyed by the mutations. In this way, the coxsackie virus could be inhibited over a long period by an siRNA against the conserved cis-acting replication element (CRE), while an siRNA targeted against structurally unimportant regions led to viral escape. [163] Even with the careful selection of target sequences, however, RNAi approaches will require the development of combination therapy, similar to those already employed in the conventional treatment of viral infections. In analogy to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in which several small-molecule active drugs are used against HIV-1, several siRNAs or shRNAs could be used against the virus. The combination of four shRNA expression cassettes in a lentiviral vector led to the viral escape of HIV-1 observed for a single shRNA being avoided. [164] The alternative to the use of siRNAs against the virus is to down-regulate cellular factors which the virus requires to enter the cell and to replicate. The chance of viral escape by mutation is drastically reduced with cellular genes. The critical factor, however, is that the corresponding protein is not essential for the cell. This is, for example, the case for the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5. Mutations in the ccr5 gene have no consequences for the health of the individual but protect the person from infection with HIV-1. Hematopoietic stem cells were protected against HIV-1 by the RNAi-mediated knockdown of CCR5. [165] This approach is not, however, restricted to HIV-1-silencing of the coxsackie virus adenovirus receptor led to a significant reduction in the replication of CVB-3. [166] [167] [168] A recently begun clinical trial for the treatment of HIV-1infected patients combined several targets and RNA-based strategies to get the best protection against escape mutants: A single lentiviral vector expresses an shRNA against the HIV-1 genes rev and tat, a hammerhead ribozyme against CCR5, and a decoy oligonucleotide against the transactivation response (TAR) element. [169, 170] The gene transfer occurs in this case ex vivo, that is, haematopoetic stem cells are removed from the patient, transduced in tissue culture with the vector, and then re-infused.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 475, "end": 480, "text": "[155]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 685, "end": 690, "text": "[156]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1173, "text": "[157]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1295, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1310, "text": "[159]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1606, "text": "[160]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1820, "text": "[161]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2134, "text": "[162]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2506, "end": 2511, "text": "[163]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3065, "end": 3070, "text": "[164]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3690, "end": 3695, "text": "[165]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3860, "end": 3865, "text": "[166]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3866, "end": 3871, "text": "[167]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3872, "end": 3877, "text": "[168]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4254, "end": 4259, "text": "[169,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4260, "end": 4264, "text": "170]", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Infections"}, {"text": "In a therapeutic program for the treatment of HBV infections, the company Nucleonics Inc. is developing a vector with four shRNAs against different segments of the viral genome.

In addition, targets may be chosen which are responsible for metastasis, since in most cases primary tumors can be surgically removed and the metastases represent the real problem. Finally, RNAi can be employed to resensitize resistant tumor cells to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy. The most important way in which tumor cells become resistant to chemotherapeutic agents is through the expression of the multidrug resistance (mdr) gene. If MDR expression is suppressed by siRNAs, the cells again become vulnerable to chemotherapeutics. [173] There are many published studies which show that tumor growth could be slowed in animal models by RNAi.

While the Tuschl II patent, which refers to the typical 19-21 base pair long siRNAs with 3' overhangs, has already been granted, the decision regarding the Tuschl I patent remains open. The Kreutzer-Limmer I patent has been granted in Europe (but not yet in the US), however its precise extent is not yet decided. [153] A strong patent position is held by the US Biotech Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Besides the named core patents on RNAi, they also hold patents on the chemical modification and delivery of the siRNAs. As a result, Alnylam has made several major deals, for example, an extensive research cooperation with Novartis in 2005. In July 2007, Roche AG received from Alnylam a non-exclusive licence for $331 million for the therapeutic use of siRNAs under Alnylam IP and their European research unit. Much attention was generated by the take over of Sirna Therapeutics by Merck & Co., USA, for $1.1 billion at the end of 2006. These transactions show that the major pharmaceutical companies have recognized the potential of RNAi and are prepared to invest a great deal in this new technology. Further details regarding the patent situation as well as related business in the RNAi field have been brought together in a recent review. [153] 7. Summary and Outlook RNA interference has developed into one of the most important technologies of biomedical research within just a few years. The simple and efficient possibility to inhibit the expression of a specific gene makes possible the elucidation of the functions of proteins which are so far unknown. However, RNAi has not only become a standard method of molecular biology-it has already made its way into the clinic. Around a dozen clinical studies based on RNAi are already running, and the first results are promising. Basically, knockdown technologies can be used against any disease in which a deleterious gene is over-expressed (for example, cancer, viral infections, inflammation). Two major obstacles must, however, be overcome before it can become a broadly applicable standard therapy: The question of their specificity and efficient delivery to the target cells. As already explained, siRNAs can cause unspecific side effects and activate the immune system. These undesired effects can be minimized by the clever selection of the sequence and the use of modified nucleotides.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 591, "end": 596, "text": "[153]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1522, "text": "[153]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Commercial Aspects of RNAi"}, {"text": "Immense efforts have been undertaken to develop carrier systems with which siRNAs can be delivered to their target cells.
