The virus was subsequently renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it causes was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Having spread to the entire globe with deaths accounting in thousands, on January 31st 2020, WHO announced the outbreak of COVID-19 as the Public Health Emergency of International Concern [PHIEC] [2] .",

Since September 2012, there were 2494 laboratoryconfirmed cases of infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with 858 deaths reported [3, 4] . Although WHO noted in 2003 that no cases of SARS-CoV have been reported due to transfusion of blood products, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through blood transfusion. Additionally, with more asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19, blood safety is worthy of consideration. The current recommendations are based largely on the new guidelines released by AABB, and a precautionary approach includes vigilant blood donor surveillance which is the desirable need of the hour [5].",
