It answers whether wages of lower-wage workers decreased more than others', and to what extent. We find that the COVID-19 outbreak exacerbates existing inequalities. Workers at the bottom quintile in mid-March were three times more likely to be laid off by mid-April compared to higher-wage workers. Weekly wages of workers at the bottom quintile decreased by 6% on average between mid-February and mid-March and by 26% between mid-March and mid-April. The average decrease for higher quintiles was less than 1% between mid-February and mid-March and about 10% between mid-March and mid-April. We also find that workers aged 16-24 were hit much harder than older workers. Hispanic workers were also hurt more than other racial groups. Their wages decreased by 2-3 percentage points more than other workers' between mid-March and mid-April.",

Millions of US workers have filed initial unemployment claims, bringing the unemployment rate in the US to 15.7% (Department of Labor, 2020). The labor market impact of the lockdown is expected to be worst for jobs that cannot be performed remotely and are not considered essential. Such jobs are also generally lower-paid (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020) . Early evidence of the impact on unemployment suggests that it rises faster for women, Black men and Hispanics (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Kalev, 2020) . Mongey, Pilossoph and Weinberg (2020) find \"that workers in low-work-from-home or high-physical proximity jobs are more economically vulnerable.\"",

Yet, it can be used to produce anonymous GICs for the periods January 2020 -February 2020, February 2020 -March 2020, and March 2020 -April 2020 for hourly wages, while excluding workers that were laid off.",

In January 2020 -February 2020 and February 2020 -March 2020 the GICs are nearly flat, indicating that the changes in hourly wages were rather homogeneous across the wage distribution. The March 2020 -April 2020 the picture is different. First, average hourly wages increased substantially for all quintiles, apart from the top quintile. Second, the increase in hourly wages generally decreases with the wage rank. Similar to Fig. 1 , this reaffirms that lower-paid workers were more likely to be laid off, which mechanically leads to an increase in hourly wages, even if workers' wages have not changed. ",

This is similar to how income growth is typically measured. A major advantage of using this measure is that it does not require information on how wages are distributed within a certain group. Only averages are needed. Another common way to quantify the change in wages is by averaging over individual relative changes in wages. For each individual in a certain group a growth rate is estimated, and then the change in wages of that group is defined as the average across all individual growth rates. The advantage of this approach is that it gives the same weight to each individual in the group, rather than to each dollar earned by a member of the group, like the previous approach.",

This is a limitation since wages differ dramatically within sectors. High-rank employees in some companies, whose wages are among the highest in the entire labor force, might be grouped together with employees that are earning the minimum wage. Nevertheless, since we are interested in average changes in wages, and not in the shape of the wage distribution, this limitation may not have a big impact on the estimated NAGICs, and the sector-average wages may still be indicative of the wages of most workers in the sector.",

Within each sector we assume the wage distribution is lognormal, a rather standard modeling assumption, 5 and assume the same degree of inequality within each sector. We simulate the distribution within each sector independently in each month, so we can no longer consider the synthetic panel -the correlation between wages at the two months will no longer represent the realistic correlation, which is close to 1 (Kopczuk, Saez and Song, 2010) . Thus, we use anonymous GICs, in which the panel component does not play a role. We compare the GICs produced using sector-average wages and the GICs produced when simulating a realistic wage distribution. Since each randomly-generated simulation yields a slightly different GIC, we consider the average of 1000 simulations, noting that in all cases described below the variation between GICs in different realizations was small. Figure 8 presents the comparison considering weekly wages using the same data used for Fig. 2 . It shows that for the period January-February the sector-average and the simulated anonymous GICs are indistinguishable. The differences for the period February-March are noticeable, but very small.",

The average decrease in weekly wages in quintiles 2-5 was about 10% by mid-April, and about 26% in the bottom quintile. The total number of employees decreased between mid-March and mid-April by about 15%. Yet, the reduction in employment was even more substantial for the bottom quintile. 30% of the workers at the bottom quintile in mid-March were laid off by mid-April. Thus, workers at the bottom quintile were about three times more likely to be laid off compared to higher-wage workers.",

            "text": "The NAGICs presented above rely on a division of workers into sectors. At this early stage the BLS seasonally adjusted establishment data for April are only available at a rather coarse resolution, and are based on 14 industry sectors: Mining and logging, Construction, Durable goods, Nondurable goods, Wholesale trade, Retail trade, Transportation and warehousing, Utilities, Information, Financial activities, Professional and business services, Education and health services, Leisure and hospitality, and Other services. The non-seasonally adjusted data are available at a slightly finer resolution, with some of the 14 sectors broken down into sub-sectors. The finer resolution allows dividing all workers into 32 sectors. For the periods January-February and February-March it is possible to use an even finer resolution of 185 sectors.Clearly, the finer the division into sectors, the more accurate the resulting NAGICs are, since we rely on the sector-average wage as being representative of the wages of workers in each sector.Since the seasonally adjusted data provide more relevant information for the interpretation of the NAGICs, we use the division to 14 sectors as the baseline NAGICs (see above). To demonstrate that this rather coarse division does not create a large impact on the resulting NAGICs, we compare the non-seasonally adjusted NAGICs based on a division to 14 sectors to a similar analysis in which workers are divided into 32 sectors and into 185 sectors. These results are presented in Fig. 4 and in Fig. 5 . Indeed the differences between the NAGICs for the three resolutions (14, 32, and 185 sectors) are small and do not change qualitatively any of the main results discussed above.",
