            "text": "Over the last decade, major advances have been made in stem cell-based therapy for ischemic stroke, which is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Various stem cells from bone marrow, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), have shown therapeutic potential for stroke. Concomitant with these exciting findings are some fundamental bottlenecks that must be overcome in order to accelerate their clinical translation, including the low survival and engraftment caused by the harsh microenvironment after transplantation. In this chapter, strategies such as gene modification, hypoxia/growth factor preconditioning, and biomaterial-based methods to improve cell survival and homing are summarized, and the potential strategies for their future application are also discussed. 202 Recently, growing evidence suggests that stem cells, including MSCs, neural stem cells (NSCs), EPCs, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), are beneficial for cerebral ischemia [77, 112] . Among these, bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) have the most promising therapeutic potential, because a large quantity can be harvested autologously without ethical or immunological issues [120] . However, a number of problems remain unresolved and need specific attention prior to general clinical translation. For example, it is still challenging that stem cell survival, homing, and engraftment rates are low after transplantation in the pathological environment subjected to multiple insults, including ischemia/hypoxia, inflammatory response, and so on, which hamper the benefits and applications of cell-based therapy.",

Approximately 8,000,000 people suffer a stroke, and more than 140,000 people die each year. Ischemic stroke accounts for over 80 % of total stroke patients [126] . Though extensive neuroprotection and regenerative studies have been performed, only tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been proven to be effective. However, due to its narrow therapeutic time window (less than 4.5 h) and hemorrhagic complication, fewer than 5 % of stroke patients are able to benefit from tPA, and even among those, only 10 % return to independent living [82] . 204 EPC medium could also promote angiogenesis [144] , or differentiate into endothelial cells to replace/repair injured ECs and integrate into endogenous blood vessels, which is detected by histological studies [26] . These results support that EPCs have great therapeutic potential for stroke, most possibly through both directly integrating into blood vessels and secreting trophic factors.",

The number of circulating VSELs in PB increases in mice after experimental stroke [55] and in stroke patients [89] , suggesting that VSELs residing in adult tissues or mobilized into PB are a potent source of adult tissue-derived stem cells that can be used for regenerative medicine, particularly for neural repair after stroke. Ratajczak et al. observed increased gene expression of both pluripotent and NSC markers in PB-borne nucleated cells in stroke patients, resembling what they previously noted in murine stroke model. Further analyses using computer tomography imaging revealed differences in VSEL mobilization between patients with posterior circulation infarcts and patients with partial anterior circulation infarcts [55] . In addition, the observation that murine VSELs are capable of differentiating into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia further encourages us to use these cells as donor grafts for regeneration of a damaged CNS. However, a limitation for clinical application is the small number of VSELs that could be harvested, requiring ex vivo expansion strategy, especially to generate enough supply of VSELs for stroke therapy in clinical setting.",

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that less than 10 % of transplanted stem cells could survive in the lesion site after transplantation as they are exposed in hostile environment, and cell death is initiated via multiple mechanisms [48] . It's reported that more cells survive when they are transplanted into sham animals (no brain injury) compared to injured animals [3] , indicating that factors in the lesion Y. Tang 205 site induce death of the transplanted cells. These factors include but not limited to time after injury [47] , distance from the transplantation site to the lesion site [86] , state of the cells transplanted (differentiated or undifferentiated) [59] , aging of the cells transplanted [108] , host immune response [35] , and phagocytic response of host [2] . Subsequent evidence shows that delivery time is the major determinant of the survival of transplanted stem cells. It is reported that NPC survival was significantly reduced following delayed cell delivery [20] , which was mediated by the inflammatory milieu.",

Inhibition of cell adhesioninduced cell death was first reported in 1994 by Frisch and Francis. They found that when epithelial cells were seeded in medium with the addition of soluble peptide-GRGDSP, which prevented cell attachment by blocking integrins, it resulted in increased apoptosis [28] . This kind of cell death is termed anoikis, which can be rescued by culturing cells on ECM-coated surfaces to promote cell adhesion. For example, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells cultured on glass coverslips coated with fibronectin or laminin showed greater viability compared to those cultured on noncoated surfaces [37] . In vitro study demonstrated that addition of laminin to neural progenitor cells increased the number of neurospheres and reduced cell death in comparison to control groups, while blocking the beta 1 integrin inhibited the effect of laminin, suggesting this is beta 1 integrin mediated [32] . One proposed explanation for detachment-induced cell death is that Bmf released from actin in terms of cytoskeleton stabilization is reduced after cell detachment. Bmf binds to Bcl-2 in mitochondria and neutralizes its antiapoptotic effect, which activates caspase-8, further releasing Bcl-2 from the mitochondria to induce cell death [29] .",

Liu et al. found that intravenously administered hMSCs overexpressing PIGF could accumulate in the ischemic lesions, further reduced lesion volume, enhanced angiogenesis, and elicited functional improvement [74] . FGF-2-modified MSCs with HSV-1 greatly reduced infarct volume and improved functional recovery at 14 days after stroke [40] . When surviving, a new apoptosis-inhibiting protein was overexpressed in MSCs and promoted MSCs' survival by 1.3-fold at 4 days and 3.4-fold higher at 14 days posttransplantation, which results in reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function [76] .",

Pharmacological agents, including diazoxide [84] , can induce protective miRs expression. Besides miRs, a recent investigation elucidated that preconditioning of MSCs with specific cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) increased cell survival via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) [54] . This evidence highlights the possibility that miRs and cfDNAs may be potential new targets to promote stem cell survival after transplantation. Collectively, these exciting results suggest that gene modification is a promising strategy to increase cell survival after transplantation, and these enhanced cell survivals could contribute to reduced infarcts and improved behavioral recovery through neuronal differentiation and promoted trophic factor secretion.",

Sublethal hypoxia preconditioning applied to stem cells have shown to activate protective signals including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), growth factors, Akt, and ERK signals to further enhance their resistance to apoptosis/necrosis cues by increasing survival signals [30] . Dr. Wei's group has performed extensive studies related to hypoxia preconditioning. In these studies they demonstrated that transplantation of hypoxia preconditioning MSCs improves infarcted heart function [38] and ischemic brain function [124] recovery via enhanced survival of implanted cells and angiogenesis. Also they found hypoxic precondition reduced ES-NPCs apoptosis by 40-50 % in serum-free medium via upregulation of erythropoietin (EPO), Bcl-2, and HIF-1alpha [114] .",

            "text": "Migration and homing of administered cells to the ischemic regions are clinically relevant and very critical to their therapeutic efficacy. A detailed analysis of the biological responses to brain injury would not only give us insight into the mechanism of stem cell homing but also give us important clues about how we can improve their homing capacity. Now it is clear that following brain injury, homing molecular cues, including chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules, originating from the inflammatory zone in the injured brain, are activated and upregulated to cause BMSC homing. Chemokines such as G-CSF and SDF-1 have been demonstrated to be an important stem cell homing mediator that mobilizes stem cells from bone marrow into the PB. G-CSF treatment enhances tissue regeneration and improves recovery after stroke by mobilizing BMSCs from bone marrow into peripheral blood [91] . Previous studies showed that subcutaneous injection of G-CSF for 5 days after cerebral ischemia promotes BMSC migration to the lesion area, reduces infarcts, and enhances functional recovery in stroke rats [101] . G-CSF treatment is also demonstrated to facilitate neurogenesis in SVZ by increasing the infiltration of BMSC into the brain [99] . BMSCs exert their benefits on cerebral ischemic injuries through promoting neuronal repair and recovery of brain function, which provides a basis for the development of a noninvasive autologous therapy for cerebral ischemia. Some pilot clinical trials demonstrated that G-CSF could mobilize BMSCs in patients after acute stroke safely and provide better neurological outcome compared to conventional treatment [101] . SDF-1 is another important homing factor, which is secreted primarily by bone marrow fibroblasts and is required for BMSC homing/retention in the bone marrow microenvironment. SDF-1 and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 were found upregulated after early focal cerebral ischemia [121] and showed beneficial for the adhesion and migration of BMSCs both to bone marrow and to ischemic tissue through activation of specific integrin molecules. Given that CXCR4 and CXCR7 are present on bone marrow stem cells [14] , upregulation of SDF-1 in the local ischemic damage after injury may be related to stem cell homing and engraftment toward the injured tissue. During cerebral ischemia, SDF-1 was found primarily co-localized with endothelial cells and closely interacted with infiltrated BMSCs from bone marrow in the ischemic penumbra region, suggesting that SDF-1 may mediate trafficking of transplanted BMSCs to ischemically damaged tissue. Indeed, overexpression of SDF-1 in ischemic tissues has recently been found to augment EPC-induced vasculogenesis in hind-limb ischemic mice, as well as enhanced recovery of blood perfusion, increased capillary density, and induced partial incorporation of EPCs Y. Tang into the microvessels [129] . Our previous studies have highlighted biphasic function of SDF-1 in stroke mice in a time-dependent manner. One study demonstrated that injection of CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 into ischemic mice during acute phase significantly suppressed inflammatory response and reduced blood-brain barrier disruption via inhibiting leukocyte migration and infiltration [39] ; however, another study showed that overexpression of SDF-1 in mice brain during post-acute phase promoted neurovascular recovery, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis through enhancing migration of neural progenitor cells and endothelial cells, while AMD3100 reversed protective effects of SDF-1 [66] .",

Intracerebral injection delivers and had the highest cell retention in a desired location compared to other methods [111] , but it also induces adverse effects involving seizures and transient motor function impairment given its invasive procedure. Intraventricular transplantation is less invasive but achieves less therapeutic efficacy as intraventricularly injected human NSCs into ischemic rat brain did not show improvement [102] . Intravenous delivery is safer and more feasible, but only few cells could localize to the infarct region [111] . Intraarterial administration contributes to more cells retaining in the brain than intravenous delivery and is beneficial for behavioral recovery [63] .

            "text": "In order to determine stem cell migration and in vivo distribution, noninvasive and real-time imaging modalities are developed in recent years. Several multifunctional nanoprobes with high MR sensitivity are developed by our group to label stem cells and allow us to longitudinally track them after injection by MRI in terms of its high spatial resolution. In one study we labeled MSCs [122] and NSCs [142] with high MR sensitivity fluorescent-magnetite-nanocluster (FMNC) and tracked them by MRI and fluorescent imaging after injection into the contralateral hemisphere of the ischemic mice brain. MSCs were detected to migrate toward the perifocal region of the ipsilateral hemisphere through the corpus callosum. We further developed a trifunctional nanoprobe by adding iodine-125 to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, which allows us to quantitatively track MSCs injected into the brain by micro-SPECT/CT and MRI. Using this method we found 30 % of intracerebrally grafted MSCs migrated from the injection hemisphere to the lesion area, and intravenously injection induced more than 90 % of MSCs migrated and accumulated in the lung, while no cells were found in the brain ( Fig. 9.1 ) [111] . However, one major limitation of SPIO-based imaging strategy is that survival and dead cells cannot be distinguished. Signals from survival and dead cells are all captured by MRI and micro-SPECT. To resolve this problem, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is developed and widely used to track the migration and survival of transplanted cells which are modified with a firefly or Renilla luciferase (Luc) enzyme [143] . However, the spatial resolution and the penetration depth of BLI are limited, which hinder its clinical application at current stage.",

By transducing MSCs with CXCR4 by lentivirus and injecting them via the femoral vein following MCAO, they found that CXCR4 overexpression promoted MSCs' migration to the infarct region and enhanced neuroprotection via increased angiogenesis [137] .

For instance, uncontrolled expression of introducing genes raises the safety issue, and the risk of tumorigenicity such as leukemia also limits its application. Recently, upregulation of homing genes in MSCs under stress conditions including hypoxia has been confirmed, which may be mediated by HIF-1 alpha [24] . It is reported that hypoxia induces CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression in BMSCs via upregulated HIF-1\u03b1 [75] , and hypoxia preconditioning enhances migration of MSCs via increased expression of cMet [93] , which hints at the possibility that hypoxia preconditioning could enhance mobilization of stem cells to lesion sites in ischemic brain. In addition to hypoxia preconditioning, H2O2 preconditioning could increase the migration of MSCs through upregulation of CXCR4 and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [65] , and pretreatment of HSCs with SDF-1 or dextran sulfate enhances their homing to bone marrow, which is involved in several genes including CXCR4 and MMP-9 [33] .",

In particular, pretreatment with eNOS enhancers significantly increased the homing of the intravenously infused EPCs or BMCs and led to increased exercise capacity in a hind-limb ischemia model [95] .

In past two decades, many protein-based, polysaccharide-based, polymer-based, peptide-based, and ceramicbased scaffolds that have been proven to promote the viability, differentiation, and migration of stem cells are well designed [125] . Both natural and synthetic biomaterials have been developed and combined with stem cell-based therapy to promote cell survival and migration posttransplantation (Table 9 .6). Fibrin gel is ranked as the first biomaterial to prevent bleeding and promote wound healing in terms of the abundance of fibrinogen, ease fabrication, controllable gelation time, and tunable mechanical property. Fibrin gel is able to exclusively enhance the migration of the transplanted cells toward the lesion boundary zone, even it disappears completely 4 weeks after transplantation [133] . In one study performed by Lee and coworkers, they designed a VEGF-releasing gel that could attract NSC migration [171] . It is also reported that PEGylated fibrin patch controlled the release of SDF-1\u03b1 at the infarct site and increased the rate of c-kit+ stem [204] Cortical injury Fibrin matrix enhanced the retention of the transplanted cells within the lesion, migration toward the lesion boundary zone, and differentiation into the neurons and perivascular cells C17.2 cell line [171] Myocardial ischemia",

In particular, an interesting study fabricated and optimized a shape-controlled 3D type-I collagen-based microgel platform to modulate SDF-1 expression of hMSCs, and hMSCs embedded in the microgels were shown to induce vascular repair and functional improvement in hind-limb ischemic mouse [116] . Currently, HA is gaining its popularity as a biomaterial for tissue regeneration [62] . By chemically modifying HA with hydroxyethyl methacrylate, controlled release of SDF-1 was achieved after its encapsulation into HA, and enhanced endothelial progenitor cell chemotaxis was identified [79] . It is also reported that loading SDF-1 and angiogenic peptides (Ac-SDKP) to HA-based hydrogel promoted regeneration of cardiac function through increasing stem cell homing and angiogenesis [103] .",

PLGA has been extensively designed for controlled release of small molecule drugs, proteins, and other macromolecules in commercial use and in research. Double-emulsion solvent extraction/evaporation is a routine technique to load proteins to biodegradable PLGA microspheres. Using this strategy, Cross et al. loaded SDF-l\u03b1 into PLGA microspheres for releasing SDF-1\u03b1 over 50 days without affecting its bioactivity, and significant migration of MSCs throughout the duration of release from the microspheres was observed [19] . Thevenot and colleagues fabricated PLGA saltleached scaffolds to carry SDF-1 and implanted in the subcutaneous cavity of Balb/c mice. They found this strategy enhanced host-derived stem cell engraftment by threefold compared to conventional mini-osmotic pump delivery for up to 2 weeks with limited inflammatory response [115] .",

In another study, He et al. synthesized SDF-1-loaded PLEOF hydrogel with poly(llactide) (PLA) fractions. A pronounced burst release followed by a period of sustained release was achieved, and MSCs showed migration to SDF-1 in a dose-dependent manner [34] . Recently, Kim et al. synthesized a dual pH-sensitive copolymer-poly (urethane amino sulfamethazine) (PUASM)-based random copolymer for controlled release of SDF-1 in stroke. This copolymer showed high protein encapsulation efficiency at pH 7.4, and at pH 5.5, it could release protein rapidly. Systemic administration of SDF-1\u03b1-loaded copolymer into ischemic rat resulted in enhanced angiogenesis and neurogenesis [51] .",

On the other hand, many experimental studies make us recognize many fundamental questions related to the cell survival, homing, and engraftment that contribute to the limited efficacy of BM-derived stem cell transplantation in the clinic. We and other groups have proposed many strategies such as gene modification, preconditioning treatment, and biomaterial-based method to overcome these limitations. Strategies to improve cell survival and homing would enhance their therapeutic efficacy and strengthen the application potential of stem cell therapy. In summary, stem cell-based therapy for ischemic stroke in humans is still in its infancy. Further basic and translational studies are required before it becomes a scientifically proven strategy in clinical setting.",
