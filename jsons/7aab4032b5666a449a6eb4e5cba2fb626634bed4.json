            "text": "This chapter is an attempt to integrate recent studies concerning the role of chemokine receptors in the initiation, development, and maintenance of allergic lung diseases collectively referred to as asthma. The pathogenesis of asthma involves the coordinated traffi cking of infl ammatory cells to the lungs and draining lymph nodes, as well as the activation of these infl ammatory cells. Chemokine receptors and their ligands play a prominent role in directing the infl ammation associated with allergic lung disease. T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses can be broadly categorized as being type 1 or type 2, based on the cell types present and the associated cytokines produced. Allergic lung disease is a predominately type 2-mediated disease. The chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR6, and CCR8 serve to promote the recruitment of type 2 T (T helper 2; Th2) cells, whereas CXCR3 antagonizes type 2 and promotes type 1 T (T helper 1; Th1) cells. The pathophysiologic manifestations of asthma, including excessive mucus production, eosinophilia, and airway hyperreactivity, are dependent upon the traffi cking and activation of eosinophils, mast cells, and goblet cells. Roles for chemokine receptors, including CCR4, CCR2, and CXCR4, in the traffi cking and activation of these cell types during allergic lung disease are discussed. Finally, the incidence of allergic lung disease is increasing, and the costs associated with it are substantial. Chemokine receptor expression and use by infl ammatory cells during allergic lung disease makes chemokine receptors an attractive therapeutic target. Implications for drug development are discussed in the context of experimental results.",

Allergic asthma is variable but is characterized by the following: altered lung function, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), chronic infl ammation, excessive mucus production, goblet cell hyperplasia, and increased IgE production. In chronic disease, signifi cant remodeling of the airways occurs including smooth muscle hypertrophy and peribronchial fi brosis. These responses have been examined extensively in animal models.",

Initial exposure results in the priming and expansion of allergen-specifi c T cells, as well as expansion of B cells and allergen-specifi c antibody production. Repeated exposure in susceptible individuals results in the expansion and traffi cking of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, mast cells, and eosinophils to the lungs (Fig. 1 ). Cytokine production, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, promotes the production of allergen-specifi c IgE by B cells, airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus production, and infl ammation. Binding of specifi c antigen by IgE bound to mast cells triggers acute allergic events. Each of these events is dependent upon the coordinated production and expression of chemokine receptor/ligand systems. Chemokine receptors and ligands play essential roles in the traffi cking, activation, and effector functions of infl ammatory and structural cells (Table 1 ).",

Thus, under Th1-promoting conditions, CXCR3 ligands including 10 kDa interferon-gamma-induced protein (IP-10)/CXCL9, gamma interferoninduced monokine (MIG)/CXCL10, and interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC)/CXCL11 preferentially attract Th1 T cells.

Pulmonary CCR4 + CD4 + cells and levels of CCL17 and CCL22 were signifi cantly increased in asthmatic children versus children with nonasthmatic chronic cough or without airway disease. In asthmatic children, CCR4 + CD4 + cells correlated positively with levels of CCL17, CCL22, serum IgE levels, and negatively with FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in the fi rst second of exhalation, a measure of lung function). Conversely, CXCR3 + CD8 + cells and levels of CXCL11 were significantly increased in children with nonatopic chronic cough compared with the other groups (2). These results have been recapitulated in segmental allergen challenge studies. In asthmatics, a majority of T cells in post-allergen challenge biopsies expressed CCR4 (3, 4) . Expression of the CCR4 ligands CCL22 and CCL17 was also upregulated on airway epithelial cells upon allergen challenge (3). CCR4 expression was not found on T cells from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which instead expressed CXCR3 (4). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate an increase in CCR4-expressing T cells in allergic airways and increased production of CCL17 and CCL22. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the increase in CCR4 expression by T cells in allergic lungs may serve to differentiate allergic from nonallergic infl ammation.",

Increased expression of CCL17 and CCL22 mRNA has been demonstrated in asthmatic bronchial epithelium and submucosa (8) . CCL17 and/or CCL22 were elevated in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of asthmatics relative to controls (9, 10) . Additionally, bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients produced more CCL17 (11, 12) . Thus, the production of CCR4 ligands is increased in asthmatic patients. In BAL of allergic asthmatic patients given serial antigen, CCL22 and CCL17 were highly increased compared with saline-challenged areas (13, 14) . The increased levels of CCL17 and CCL22 correlated with lymphocyte numbers and the levels of IL-5 and IL-13 (14) . Thus, within individual lungs, production of CCL17 and CCL22 correlate with areas of allergic infl ammation.",

Similar to the results obtained in the ovalbumin models, in a live Aspergillus model of allergic lung disease, CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice had attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness and attenuated eosinophilia at later time points after fungal challenge (19) . Interestingly, CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice had increased airway neutrophils and macrophages early day3 (d3) after fungal challenge, which was accompanied by an increase in IL-4 and IL-5 (19) . Follow-up studies have demonstrated that both CCL17 and CCL22 impair the innate antifungal immune response, thereby promoting the maintenance of acquired Th2-mediated asthmatic disease (20, 21) . These results may be explained in part by the expression of CCR4 by other cell types including dendritic cells, platelets, T regulatory cells, and mast cells (22) (23) (24) (25) . Thus, even though expression data in human disease suggest that CCR4 and its ligands may be good targets for therapy, data from murine models of disease indicate that a diverse number of mechanisms may be controlled by CCR4.",

Primary human bronchoepithelial cells stimulated with type 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) or particulate matter produced macrophage infl ammatory protein 3-\u03b1 (MIP-3\u03b1)/CCL20, and this may be one mechanism for dendritic cell traffi cking to the lung (32). The role of CCR6/CCL20 has been investigated by our laboratory using a cockroach antigen-induced allergic airway disease. CCL20 is induced within hours of allergen challenge (33). CCR6 \u2212/\u2212 mice were equivalently immunized, as assessed by T-cell cytokine production, but had attenuated airway hyperreactivity, fewer eosinophils, lower IL-5, and lower IgE levels than wild-type mice (33). CCL20 was not directly chemotactic for eosinophils at doses comparable with those used for CCL11-mediated chemotaxis (33), thus the effect on eosinophils was likely related to the lower IL-5. Type 2 cytokine and eosinophilia were reconstituted in CCR6 \u2212/\u2212 mice by adoptive transfer of T cells from sensitized wild-type mice, however airway hyperreactivity was unaffected. Thus, CCR6 plays a role in promoting allergic lung disease, in part due to its expression on T cells, but also likely in part due to T cell-independent effects (34). Although the effects in CCR6 \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated striking reductions in allergen sensitized and challenged mice, additional research is needed to identify the exact mechanism of the altered phenotype, which may include recruitment of dendritic cell (DC) subsets to the lung.",

            "text": "A primary chemokine receptor associated with Th2-type responses is CCR8, which is also upregulated on Th2 cells derived in vitro. CCR8 is expressed by thymocytes, monocytes, as well as Th2 cells, and serves as the receptor for I-309/TCA-3/CCL1. In humans, expression of CCR8 was found on T cells in endobronchial biopsies of asthmatic patients taken 24 hours after allergen challenge (35). Additionally, increased expression of the CCR8 ligand CCL1 has been reported during allergic lung disease (35). One study found impaired Th2 responses in CCR8 \u2212/\u2212 mice in ovalbumin (OVA)-and cockroach antigeninduced models of allergic lung disease, as well as Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA)-induced Th2 granuloma model. In each of these models, decreases in both Th2-type cytokines and eosinophils were present (36). Also using the OVA-induced model of allergic lung disease, two groups reported that CCR8 \u2212/\u2212 mice developed similar eosinophilia, lung infl ammation, and Th2 cytokine levels compared with wild-type mice (35,37). The reason for discordance in these fi ndings is unclear, but recent studies point to a role for CCR8 on other cell types including CD4 + CD25 + T cells and dendritic cells (38, 39) . Thus, the role of CCR8 in development of allergic responses may be due in part to regulation of Th1-type responses by the production of IL-10. Further analyses will likely examine the potential mechanism of T regulatory (Treg) cell development and CCR8 expression.",

CXCR3 ligands CXCL9-11 were all originally identifi ed as IFN-\u03b3-inducible chemokines, so it comes as no surprise that CXCR3 ligands predominate under Th1 conditions. CXCR3-expressing cells predominate under type 1 conditions such as pulmonary sarcoidosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (3). The Th1/Th2 dogma would predict that the CXCR3 axis may serve to antagonize Th2 development, but in established allergic lung disease, the expression of CXCR3 and its ligands would be minimal. For the most part, published data support this view. For example, neutralization of CXCL9 in the airways at time of allergen challenge increased AHR, eosinophilia, and IL-4. Conversely, exogenous addition of CXCL9 reduced AHR and eosinophilia and increased IL-12 (40) . Similarly, neutralization of CXCL10 resulted in exaggerated AHR and eosinophilia associated with decreased numbers of CXCR3 + CD4 + T cells (41) . Interestingly, exogenous administration of CXCL10 to the airways attenuated early AHR but increased eosinophilia and later AHR (41) . Thus, modulation of CXCR3 ligands has both expected and unexpected effects on allergic lung disease. This is likely due to the ability to recruit both Th1-type cells and eosinophils to the airways during allergen challenge.",

Additionally, CXCR3 was the most highly expressed chemokine receptor on lung mast cells (46) , and specifi cally mast cells in airway smooth muscle (47) . Smooth muscle cell-driven chemotaxis of mast cells was predominately CXCR3-mediated, and CXCL10 production by smooth muscle was increased in asthmatics relative to controls (47) . Together, these results suggest a role for CXCR3 and its ligands in promoting allergic airway disease independent of CXCR3 expression by T cells. It is noteworthy that genetic studies have identifi ed a polymorphism in CXCR3, which is associated with the risk of asthma development (48) . The polymorphism is a G\u2192A substitution, but the functional consequences of this polymorphism are not yet clear (48) .

Mechanisms of action of chemokines on eosinophils include chemotaxis, as well as direct activation and prosurvival signals. Eosinophils are thought to be signifi cant producers of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, as well as proteolytic enzymes that result in damage and remodeling of airways (49) . The chemokine receptor that is predominately expressed on eosinophils is CCR3, which appears to mediate the most potent activating and recruitment responses. However, CCR3 is not only expressed by eosinophils but also by basophils, mast cells, and Th2 cells. Ligands for CCR3 include CCL 11, 24, 26 (eotaxin-1, -2, -3), as well as CCL 5, 7, 8, and 13. CCL11 induces chemotaxis and degranulation of eosinophils through the activation of extracellular signalregulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (50, 51) . Interestingly, CXCR3 ligands CXCL 9-11 can behave as natural antagonists for CCR3 (5), providing evidence for competitive binding between chemokines that may regulate migration. The role of CCR3/CCL11 in the chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils during allergic lung disease has fi gured prominently in the literature and has been the focus of many drug discovery programs.",

More recently, functional CCR3 has been described on airway epithelial cells (69) , as well as on primary bronchial epithelial cells from patients with infl ammatory lung diseases including asthma (69) . Additionally, mast cells express CCR3 intracellularly, which can be mobilized to the surface upon activation via Fc\u03b5R. The combination of Fc\u03b5R plus eotaxin (and possibly other CCR3 ligands) led to enhanced IL-13 production (70), thereby providing an additional source of proallergic and profi brotic mediators. Another recent study demonstrated the expression of CCR3 on asthmatic airway smooth muscle (71); CCR3 was functional on these cells as evidenced by calcium fl ux, and eotaxin was chemotactic for airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells in vitro (71) . Therefore, although CCR3 blockade may be useful for antagonizing the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs during allergic lung disease, CCR3 antagonists are likely to have numerous effects on other cell types as well. These may offer additional benefi cial effects for the treatment of asthma not provided by the previous studies using anti-IL-5, which targeted only eosinophils.",

CCR1 is expressed on several cell types including mast cells, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils and binds CCL3, CCL5, and CCL7, as well as a number of other chemokines. In a model of chronic fungal allergic lung disease, CCR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited an enhanced type 1 response relative to wild-type mice and were protected from airway remodeling but had similar airway hyperresponsiveness (74) . In the same model, a CCR1 antagonist attenuated airway infl ammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling (75) . Recent data from our laboratory have pointed to a critical role for CD8 + T cells expressing CCR1 in a model of virus-induced exacerbation of allergic lung disease (76) (77) (78) (79) . Thus, CCR1 appears to be most relevant during pathogen-associated disease that promotes exacerbated airway responses. Additionally, there is evidence that CCR1 expression by eosinophils and mast cells may play a role in allergic lung disease. Mast cells migrate to CCL5 in vitro (80) , and CCR1 + mast cells were found in the lungs of asthmatic patients, with comparatively few found in normal controls (25). Met-RANTES, a modifi ed chemokine protein, inhibited eosinophil effector function, which was mediated at least in part via its effects on CCR1 blockade (81, 82) . A number of other antibody-based and small-molecule antagonists have been developed for CCR1 as well (64, 68, 83) . Although CCR1 antagonists have not performed well in clinical trials of autoimmune diseases, they have yet to be applied to asthmatic disease. Because many asthmatic exacerbations are caused by infectious agents, CCR1 antagonists may provide signifi cant therapeutic effects.",

Using a fungal allergeninduced model of allergic lung disease, mice defi cient in either MCP-1 or CCR2 developed eosinophilic airway infl ammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, airway hyperreactivity, elevations in serum IgE, and airway fi brosis similar to those seen in wild-type mice (91) . In the ovalbumin model of allergic lung disease, one group reported exaggerated allergic responses in CCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (92), whereas another reported that CCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had indistinguishable responses from wild-type mice (93) . In models of allergen-induced disease, animals treated with anti-CCL2 had signifi cantly reduced airway parameters related to mast cell activation and lymphocyte recruitment. Interestingly, CCL2 appears to be able to direct the immune response toward a Th2 phenotype through downregulation of IL-12 and direct skewing of T cells for increased IL-4 production (94) . Thus, the role of CCR2 in allergic lung disease remains controversial and may depend upon a number of factors, including the experimental model (OVA; live Aspergillus; Aspergillus antigen) used to induce airway disease, as well as susceptibility of background strains of mice. CCR2 likely plays a role in modulating the innate immune response to viable organisms, as well as recruitment of mononuclear cells to the lungs. In the case of static antigens, such as Aspergillus antigen or ovalbumin, CCR2 seems to play a less prominent role. Comparatively few studies in humans have been published that either confi rm or deny a role for CCR2 or its ligands in allergic lung disease, but those that do exist have not implicated CCR2 prominently (4).",

One study reported that CXCR4 is increased on BAL eosinophils from patients with eosinophilic lung disease relative to eosinophils in peripheral blood (95) . However, another study suggested increases in CCR4, CCR9, and CXCR3, without increased CXCR4 on BAL eosinophils (44) . In animal models, antibody-mediated neutralization of CXCR4 or CXCL12 resulted in attenuated eosinophilia and reduced airway hyperresponsiveness in the OVA-induced allergic disease model (96) . Conversely, overexpression of CXCL12 exacerbated infl ammation. More recently, a number of studies have demonstrated, using a specifi c CXCR4 antagonist (97) , attenuated allergic responses in allergic lung disease, as well as other infl ammatory disease models (98) (99) (100) . In the cockroach antigen model of allergic lung disease, this was accompanied by decreases in eosinophilia and T cells in the lungs and a shift in balance of lung cytokines from type 2 to type 1 (98) . Therefore, in addition to its role in hematopoietic homeostasis, CXCR4 can play an important role in regulating allergic lung disease. It is likely that as CXCR4 can be found on multiple leukocyte populations, both innate and acquired immune cells, the targeting of this receptor may have an overall anti-infl ammatory effect.",

Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in CXCR1 have been identifi ed that were present at increased frequency in children with asthma (103) . Although CXCR1 and CXCR2 ligands are thought to be produced primarily by epithelial cells, eosinophils can make CXCL5/epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating protein 78 (ENA-78) and CXCL1/growthregulated protein alpha precursor (GRO-\u03b1), implicating a potential role for these chemokine systems in chronic allergic disease (104, 105) .

In the mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, CXCR2 neutralization resulted in attenuated airway hyperreactivity and ablation of mucus production in response to viral infection in the lungs (107) . Viral clearance and neutrophil infl ux were similar between the two groups (107) , demonstrating that CXCR2 promotes the development of lung disease in response to viral or fungal infection, but this role does not appear to occur via neutrophil recruitment. Neutralization of CXCL1 and CXCL8 in a cockroach antigen model of allergic lung disease resulted in attenuated neutrophils and lymphocytes in the airways and a decrease in serum IgE (108) . Thus, CXCR2 may contribute to allergic lung disease via promoting both neutrophil dependent and/or neutrophil-independent mechanisms. Whether blocking CXCR2 has an effect on long-term disease or on specifi c aspects, such as mucus overproduction, may depend upon the nature of the exacerbating stimulus.",

CX3CR1/CX3CL1 has been studied extensively in atherosclerosis and kidney disease, but it may play a role in allergic disease as well. Serum CX3CL1 and expression of CX3CR1 by T cells were increased in asthmatic patients (111) . Additionally, soluble CX3CL1 was upregulated in BAL after allergen challenge, as was membrane-bound CX3CL1 on endothelial and epithelial cells (111) . Thus, CX3CL1 may provide a signifi cant bound molecule allowing a \"solid phase\" chemokine gradient to be readily established. It has also been reported that fractalkine is produced by airway smooth muscle cells and may contribute to mast cell recruitment in asthma (112) .

As would be predicted, T cells from the lungs of mice infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (a Th2mediated response) migrated better to the CCR4 ligand CCL17 than T cells from the lungs of infl uenza-infected mice (114) . However, T cells from the spleens of N. brasiliensis-infected mice migrated better to CCL17 than lung T cells (114) . These fi ndings are an example of the dynamic nature of chemotaxis, in that a combination of receptors and ligands are likely responsible for traffi cking to, and even within, tissues.

Although pattern recognition receptors (including Toll-like receptors, mannose receptor, etc.) have received considerable attention in host defense, their roles in allergic lung disease will likely be addressed more in the near future. Viral infection presents a likely situation for cross talk between innate immunity and allergic lung disease. Individuals with severe acute viral infection can present with signs and symptoms similar to allergic lung disease including infl ammation, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that viral infections can play a role in the exacerbation of allergic lung disease (76) (77) (78) . Respiratory viral infections, including adenovirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, contribute to the exacerbation of existing disease.
