In 1908, Danish scientists Vilhelm Ellerman and Oluf Bang discovered an infectious pathogen that could be transmitted from one chicken to another, a non-cellular pathogen capable of causing cancer. The agent was able to pass through filters designed for cells and bacteria, leading them to the observation that a non-cellular pathogen was inducing cancer (Ellerman and Bang, 1908). A few years later, in 1911, Peyton Rous from Rockefeller University made a related observation by identifying a similar pathogen, naming it the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Peyton Rous was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery, the first identifiable retrovirus (Rous, 1911).",

The viruses were named after either the species that were their hosts or the tumor types that they caused. It became apparent, even before the mechanisms were understood, that these viruses were highly specific to the target hosts that they are able to infect. This newfound study of cancer-causing viruses brought about an understanding of this universal phenomenon that could be observed in mammalian and avian organisms. The concept that cancer was caused by an infectious agent was a natural thought process that followed the discoveries of multiple external agents responsible for disease throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including the vaccination work against smallpox by Edward Jenner in 1796. The concept of cancer being caused by an infectious agent had the unwanted consequence of sending researchers on the wrong track, since we now know that most human cancers are not caused by viruses but rather from \u201cwithin\u201d (see below).",

This central dogma was widely accepted to be invariant in every organism and implied that something that changed a cell\u2019s phenotype (such as a virus) would necessarily require that its genetic information be stored in the form of DNA (Watson and Crick, 1953). However, in 1959, Howard Temin found the first exception to this rule while doing research for his PhD thesis on RSV and other viruses that would soon be compiled into a family known as Retroviridae. His viral stocks were absent of DNA and appeared to use RNA as their genome, implying that retroviruses did not replicate themselves in the set pattern described in the Central Dogma. As a graduate student, Temin had managed to prove that there were viruses that could replicate through a process he called reverse transcription. The reason it was called as such was due to the fact that replication seemed to occur in reverse, using a single strand of RNA to form double-stranded DNA (Temin and Rubin, 1958). Furthermore, before Temin\u2019s work, it was unclear whether a virus was a quantal unit or a solution with transforming potential. He proved that viruses were actually particles capable of transforming the phenotype of an infected cell and all of its progeny. Temin also proved the existence of the enzyme that was responsible for reverse transcription, which he called reverse transcriptase. This enzyme was isolated by David Baltimore, who shared the Nobel Prize with Howard Temin for this work (Temin, 1964).",

In the 1970s, Harold Varmus, Mike Bishop, and colleagues identified the general structure of retroviral genomes as having two repeated sequences on the ends and three viral genes, gag, pol, and env. However, in the case of the tumor-forming viruses, there was another gene downstream of env that turned out to be responsible for the induction of the transformed phenotype. In the case of RSV, the gene was called Src and referred to as an oncogene because it caused cancer (Stehelin et al., 1976). Further experiments showed that this fourth gene was different from virus to virus, and unlike the other viral genes, the oncogene was closely related to a cellular gene found in the cells of the host animal that the virus previously infected. These oncogenes appeared to be stolen from the host genome and then expressed either in the wrong cell type or in an unregulated manner by the virus leading to the formation of cancer (Kurth, 1983). The realization that our own genes caused cancer and that cancer was a product formed from within us changed the way we think about this disease and led to Varmus and Bishop being awarded the Nobel Prize for their work (Bishop, 1983).",

These cellular proto-oncogenes were found to encode the components of signal transduction pathways involved in both the proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. These gene products cover the entire spectrum from overexpression of ligands such as PDGF (v-SIS) to mutant active receptors such as EGFR (v-erbB), to constitutively active downstream components such as Ras and Akt, and transcription factors such as Myc, Jun, and Fos (Pech et al., 1989). Because of their natural ability to function as tumor-inducing agents, retroviruses became prime candidates for the creation of genetically engineered tumorigenic vectors that could be designed to transfer any gene and test its ability to induce tumor formation. In the 1990s, RSV was turned into a viral vector by Steve Hughes. The Src gene was replaced by any gene of interest that was less than 2.5 kb (due to packaging constraints) and became known as the replication-competent ALV splice acceptor, or RCAS in short (Petropoulos and Hughes, 1991).",

The cell surface receptor that permits ALV-A subgroup infection of host cells is limited to birds (Coffin et al., 1997). The genetic locus that encodes the receptor for subgroup A viruses is referred to as tv-a, or tumor virus-a. This gene was cloned from quail cells by Bates, Young, and Varmus using expression cloning from quail DNA into mouse cells and identified by its ability to confer susceptibility to RCAS infection (Bates et al., 1993). When expressed in mammalian cells, this gene product, tv-a, allows the infection by RCAS vectors and subsequent expression of whatever gene is inserted downstream of the env gene. Furthermore, due to splicing differences between avian and mammalian cells, the mRNAs that encode the viral gene products gag, pol, and env are unstable and produce essentially no protein. The overall result is receptor-mediated gene targeting to mammalian cells engineered to express tv-a. Federspiel and Hughes were the first to demonstrate the specificity of this system in transgenic mice. They showed that RCAS vectors expressing the marker gene alkaline phosphatase would specifically infect myocytes of mice transgenic for expression of tv-a from a muscle-specific promoter (Federspiel et al., 1994).",

Genetically engineered retroviruses are called \u201cecotropic\u201d when they can only infect host cells of the same species as the natural hosts of the wild-type virus and \u201cxenotropic\u201d when they can only infect cells from species that differ from its natural host. \u201cAmphotropic\u201d viruses are capable of infecting both host cells and cells of other species (Katen et al., 2001). It is largely due to the polytropic characteristics of amphotropic viruses that diseases can transfer from one species to another. Two examples of cross-species disease transfer are seen in the HIV virus (monkey to human) and the virus that causes SARS (avian to human) (Marx et al., 2001). Retroviruses have two identical copies of single-stranded RNA, called a capsid and an outer envelope comprised of glycoproteins used in the docking of the virus to the host cell. The envelope glycoproteins interact in a highly specific manner, allowing them to dock only to a corresponding receptor protein on the membrane of the cell. For example, avian sarcoma and leucosis viruses and mouse mammary tumor virus infect in a species-specific manner (DeLarco and Todaro, 1976).\n\n",

As noted above, the tv-a expression in mammals does not occur, so infection with RCAS vectors will only happen if the mammal is transgenically modified to express tv-a in order for susceptibility to RCAS to occur. Usually, there is no obvious phenotype expressed by tv-a expression, because its only effect is to force susceptibility to RCAS (Fisher et al., 1999). Several transgenic mice have been generated that express tv-a from a variety of tissue-specific promoters, including those from the GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and nestin genes which direct expression of tv-a in brain tissue (Holland and Varmus, 1998, Holland et al., 1998) (Figure 2.2 and Color Plate 5).\n\n",

For example, the first tv-a transgenic mice used for brain tumor modeling drove the tv-a gene from the GFAP promoter. The second line drove tv-a from the nestin promoter (Holland et al., 1998). Comparison between the two demonstrated that properties of the two cell populations in vivo controlled their ability to form tumors from one oncogenic stimulus or another. Generally speaking, less differentiated cells are more capable of serving as the cell of origin for gliomas in an otherwise wild-type background. Loss of tumor suppressor genes changes the spectrum of tumors that form and enables some cell types to form tumors that were otherwise not able to do so (see Section 2.5.2).",

Gliomas probably form from stem cells or progenitors and are driven by the signaling pathways that drive normal development in the CNS such as PDGF and downstream effectors such as RAS and Akt. The most potent oncogene in the formation of gliomas is the PDGFB ligand (Dai et al., 2001). Several systems including RCAS/tv-a have shown that the histology of glial tumors induced by PDGF is that of a diffuse glioma with oligodendroglioma characteristics, including oval-shaped cells with the \u201cfried egg\u201d white halo appearance and the full secondary structures of Scherer. There appears to be a correlation with the amount of PDGF expression and the grade of the tumors, ranging from either low-grade gliomas to those having anaplastic features such as pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation (Shih et al., 2004). The bulk of the cells in these tumors shows low Akt activity and GFAP expression consistent with their counterparts in humans. The activation of Akt by infection with constitutively active Akt leads to the formation of cells with more astrocytic histology with irregular nuclei, cytoplasm staining for GFAP, and astrocytic morphology (Uhrbom et al., 2002).",

In this case, conditional knockout of the locus can be achieved with RCAS gene transfer. This process uses cre\u2013lox recombination with the site-specific gene recombinase cre that catalyzes recombination between two specific and identical sites in the DNA, called the lox p sites. The core sequence flanked by the lox sites (or floxed) is then deleted when the two lox sites are recombined. The PTEN gene was floxed by knocking in a floxed version of PTEN to the endogenous locus resulting in a functional PTEN allele that could be deleted by cre expression. The RCAS vector has also been engineered to carry the cre recombinase, and cells from mice with the floxed PTEN allele that are infected with RCAS-cre subsequently delete PTEN (Hu et al., 2005).

The most commonly used source of light production for BLI is the firefly luciferase gene that can be expressed from a tissue-specific promoter or a promoter that responds to a signaling pathway that is critical to the biology of the tumor. The mice are then injected with the substrate for luciferase, luciferin, and the enzyme cleaves luciferin in an ATP-dependent manner.
