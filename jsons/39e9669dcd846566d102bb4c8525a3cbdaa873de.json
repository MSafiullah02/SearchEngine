Therefore, we repeated the fit procedure with N as a free fit parameter to find that the form of X(t) is not altered substantially for different values of N. I(t) can vary more strongly, reflected by a larger variation in I 0 . This result suggests that the estimation of the number of infecteds is associated with a larger uncertainty. The general shape of I(t), however, remains stable such that the inference of the peak time of unidentified infecteds is sound. Furthermore, the model favors larger values of the containment rate \uf8ff 0 for larger population sizes in order to reproduce empirical data. This is reasonable because the number of available transmission pathways grows quadratically with the population size, making it easier for the disease to spread faster. In order to still observe sub-exponential growth, a large part of the susceptible population has to be removed quickly. Consistently, we find that a decay of susceptibles is necessary to obtain the observed growth behavior (i.e. \uf8ff 0 > 0). In contrast, one may assume that the containment rate is \uf8ff 0 = 0 if one concurrently assumes that implementation of containment measures was very fast, such that only a very small effective population N e \u2327 N was at risk to obtain the infection, as desrcibend in the Supplementary Text.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Materials and Methods"}, {"text": "Concerning variation in the fixed epidemiological parameters, values in the range of 3 \uf8ff R 0,free \uf8ff 12 yield results similar to the ones described above when adjusting the infectious period T I to smaller values for smaller reproduction numbers and larger values for larger reproduction numbers, suggesting that a certain range of transmission rates around \u21b5 = 0.6/d to \u21b5 = 0.8/d has to be assumed to reproduce the observed growth consistently.

As expected, we find that the case numbers grow exponentially initially for the population sizes given in table S2. In order to obtain reasonable fits from this limiting case of the original model, we have to assume that the implementation of containment strategies was so effective that only a limited effective population N e \u2327 N takes part in the transmission process, which we assume to be an additional fit parameter here.
