IVIg has been found to be very effective if given within the fi rst 10 days of onset of illness. In case, however, the child presents late and the acute phase reactants are still elevated or if there are CAAs on echocardiography, IVIg should still be administered. The response to IVIg is often dramatic, and the irritability, so characteristic of KD, often disappears within a few hours of initiation of the infusion. Fever defervescence usually occurs within 12-18 h. Administration of IVIg can, on occasions, be associated with signifi cant adverse effects like headache and vomiting. These are thought to be secondary to a mild aseptic meningitis which is known to be associated with administration of IVIg. These can usually be managed quite easily with symptomatic treatment.

There is no gold standard for diagnosis of KD, it is to be considered in a child with prolonged pyrexia, irritability and sequential appearance of clinical signs of KD. 4. The management is with IVIg and aspirin. The latter is used initially in antiinfl ammatory doses initially and then reduced to antiplatelet dose. The duration of treatment depends on the coronary artery involvement. 5. There are no clear guidelines for resistant KD, most centres would use a second dose of IVIg, and other choices are steroids and infl iximab.",
