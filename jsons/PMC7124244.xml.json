The final diagnoses of febrile non-SARS cases with infiltration on chest radiography were bronchopneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, and 1 newly diagnosed AIDS patient with pneumocystis carinii infection.

Although these later symptoms may be helpful in making the diagnosis of SARS, they may not be useful in making early diagnosis. Third, the study was conducted in a single medical center in northern Taiwan, so the findings may not be extrapolated to other patients across the island. However, because the institution was the leading SARS hospital during the outbreak, reporting in total about 24% of the probable SARS cases in Taiwan, the samples should be considered representative.",

Second, because cough is a nonspecific symptom, describing the presence of cough only fails to be the benchmark used to discriminate SARS from a variety of other respiratory tract infections. Third, in the early stage, febrile patients may have acquired the SARS coronavirus without developing respiratory symptoms. Excluding the diagnosis of SARS in this patient group according to the absence of cough exposes the community to the risk of further disease spread.",
