            "text": "Currently, inventory is considered to be one of the more costly operating expenses of business. In some industries, inventory management has emerged as a critical factor in profitability and productivity optimization. A supply chain is a system that involves all the facilities or entities that are required to transform raw materials into final products. It consists of stages, like suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers, etc. In practice, supply chains are highly uncertain. Supplier reliability, uncertainty and poor performance in one stage can affect the whole supply chain. These disruptions can occur on the supplier and retailer sides. To anticipate the disruption situations similar to real world scenarios, we considered two states (ON and OFF) to define the status of both the supplier and retailer. ON state indicates that the supplier is available for placing a new order & OFF state means supplier is currently unavailable for that purpose. Disruptions that are beyond human control cannot be undone, but if proper measures are taken, reordering points, order quantities and optimum supplier reliability can be set in such a way so as to maximize the total gains of a replenishment cycle. A highly reliable supplier leads to a high-quality product which, in turn, reduces inspection and rejection costs, at the same time increasing purchasing cost. Therefore, supplier reliability should be set at a certain limit. To make the inventory model closer to a \u201creal life\u201d scenario, we included supplier reliability in our inventory model. Since inventory cost has become a key concern for organizations and managers, these groups are interested in reducing this cost most of the time. Hence, the objective of a company is to maximize their profit by considering some inventory cost parameters, so that this cost is the lowest possible at any particular period.",

            "text": "Operations research, computer science, production inventory systems and management have emerged as the most crucial research interests for many researchers and academics. In previous studies, many researchers concentrated on developing inventory models for ideal situations. For example, Parlar and Berkin (1991) established an inventory model where supply disruption was considered. Their main assumption was that the supplier\u2019s state is known to the decision maker, and they are in either an ON or OFF state. They also presumed that the decision maker follows a ZIO (Zero Inventory Ordering) standard where an order is placed when inventory levels reach zero. Parlar and Perry (1995) established another inventory model where the state of the supplier was unknown to the decision maker, like in their previous work. Again, ZIO policy was not followed. Rather there was a reorder point. Gupta (1996) assumed that customer demand follows a Poisson process and that lost sales are generally caused by shortages. He also considered a non-zero (but deterministic) lead time. Parlar (1997) focused on a review-type inventory problem which is continuous and stochastic in nature, considering random demand and random lead times, where the availability of the supplier was modelled as a semi-Markov process. In this case, the standard (q, r) policy was followed when the supplier was available (ON). Heydari and Norouzinasab (2016) developed a two-stage supply chain involving a single manufacturer and single retailer, where they proposed an incentive policy to fix pricing strategies, lead time and ordering. They assumed that stochastic demand is dependent on price and lead time. Yao and Minner (2017) presented an inventory model that includes different supply options (multiple-sourcing, transhipment, supplier selection methods) and summarized their influence from managerial perspective. C\u00e1rdenas-Barr\u00f3n et al. (2018) proposed an inventory model by assuming that ending inventory level can be negative. Their work formulated an economic order quantity model to maximize the retailer\u2019s total profit per unit time under nonlinear holding cost and demand. L\u00fccker et al. (2019) focused on managing disruption considering reserve capacity for inventory decisions and stochastic demand simultaneously. Moreover, they assumed zero lead time to neglect the effects of safetly stock in their mathematical model. Dem et al. (2019) worked on an inventory model where defective and non-defective items can be produced. In their study, they thought that demand depends on defective and non-defective factors. An objective of the study was to find the optimal production policy to maximize profit where the reliability of the system was considered exponentially decreasing as a function of time.",

Dada et al. (2007) solved a newsvendor related problem with multiple suppliers, where any given supplier was characterized as either perfectly reliable (a supplier delivering an identically equal quantity to the desired quantity) or unreliable (a supplier, with some probability, delivering a quantity strictly less than the quantity expected). Sting and Huchzermeier (2012) analysed dual sourcing decisions considering supply and demand uncertainty which are stochastically dependent on each other. Results were extended to the rather wide range classes of endogenous supply uncertainty formed by Dada et al. (2007). Hishamuddin et al. (2013) developed a recovery model for a two-stage supply chain system considering disruption that can happen due to transportation. In their model, the authors tried to optimize ordering and production quantities during the disruption recovery window with a cost minimization objective. Li et al. (2017) considered a single stage supply chain where demand is deterministic and disruptions can lead to production delay. Their paper developed a cost minimization model by comparing proactive and reactive strategies in case of disruption management. Schmitt et al (2017) used a dynamic ordering approach and found considerable performance improvement compared to adaptive approach to mitigate supply disruptions. In their model they did not consider randomness in disruption duration which can be one important aspect for real world supply chain. Giri and Sarker (2019) worked on a three-echelon supply chain model where they considered a raw material supplier, one manufacturer and one retailer. They considered the way both the raw material supplier and manufacturer can have issues of disruption in their production. The objective of the study was to determine the optimal lot size for both the supplier and manufacturer and to maximize total profit.",

(2014a, b, c, 2015a, b, 2019a, b). Mohebbi and Hao (2008) inferred that in a stochastic inventory system, an unreliable supplier with a single item varies randomly between two feasible states (i.e., availability and unavailability), following a dual state continuous time-homogeneous Markov chain. Bag et al. (2009) developed an inventory model with three types of cost: holding cost, set up cost and production cost, where flexibility, demand and reliability are considered as fuzzy random variables. Sana (2010) established a mathematical model that optimizes the production rate and product reliability to determine the maximum cumulated profit for an imperfect manufacturing process. Qi (2013) worked on an inventory model for a retailer with a single product and constant demand. This model was a continuous review inventory model where replenishment decisions were made based on reliability, and costs were presented by two different suppliers. Paul et al (2013) developed a production inventory system that considered disruption in the production process. Silbermayr and Minner (2014) developed a supply chain with one buyer where demand follows the Poisson process. The buyer can order from a set of suppliers with unreliable supply performance. Torkul et al. (2016) worked on a model to arrange the reorder point in a time based manner to eliminate safety stock. Huang et al. (2018) developed a two-level supply chain model considering an unreliable supplier\u2019s production system and a price-sensitive retailer\u2019s demand. In this model, it was considered that production lines may shift between \u201cin control\u201d to \u201cout of control\u201d states randomly. Rohaninejad et al. (2018) focused on a multi-echelon supply chain where the reliability of the facilities can be improved by investing. One major assumption of their model was that the integrated optimization approach among stages are more effective than individual optimization. However, in their model other significant relations were absent such as the cost of supplying demand from one stage which can be dependent on the planned level of reliability to other echelon of the network. Yan et al. (2019) established an inventory model to define the order strategies of a two-stage supply chain system. They considered both of the suppliers unreliable and might cause random disruptions. Optimal ordering policy, order quantity and expected profit were derived from this model. To make the model more realistic, their single period disruption model can be extended to address multiple period disruption situations.",

This meant that when an order was placed, a shipment was received instantly, or after a random or fixed lead time. Yet, researchers have assumed a supplier is always available when needed. However, as the examples provided have shown, this is not always the case. The supplier may be in a state of disruption for many reasons. They can be unavailable for a random time at random times. Another assumption has been that the retailer is always available. The main function of a retailer is to store inventory to satisfy demand. When events like a natural disaster or political strikes occur, there is a possibility that retailing is disrupted. For example, an end product may be destroyed and not reach the hands of the consumer. Such events may hamper the production of the manufacturer. If the manufacturer cannot deliver its product to the retailer, then it may not go into further production. The disruption at the supplier will impede supply reaching the manufacturer. The disruption at the retailer hampers the production of the manufacturer, the end product that will be consumed by the consumer, and also the inventory level of the retailer. Finally, in most of the cases reported above, the reliability of the supplier was not considered. Highly reliable suppliers give high-quality products, which reduces inspection and rejection costs. To summarize, the aims of the study are:i.To formulate a three stage inventory model for a manufacturer facing random demand at random times;ii.To develop a mathematical framework considering a single supplier and single retailer with random capacity and demand;iii.To incorporate reliability of the supplier;iv.To model and optimize the final profit function for the manufacturer; andv.To understand the relationship among different decision variables through a numerical example.",

Here, disruptions at both the retailer and supplier are considered to take the inventory model one step closer to a real-world scenario. Also, supplier reliability is related to the inventory model. So, to make the inventory model closer to a real-world model of practice, we include supplier reliability in our inventory model. The main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows:i.Establishment of an updated efficient heuristic for generating a revised production plan after disruption.ii.Development of a mathematical model for a manufacturer facing random demand considering that the supplier can face disruptions and random capacity.iii.Extension of the heuristic considering various disruptions on a real-time basis. The revised plans may or may not be affected by any new disruptions after previous ones, where their situation may be viewed as dependent and independent and these scenarios can be handled by the new extended heuristic.iv.Consideration that the reliability of the supplier in model development and both the supplier and retailer can be disrupted at random times.v.Optimization of the resulting final objective equation of the formulated model using a suitable nonlinear optimization technique to get the value of the decision variables, which are mainly state respective order quantities, reorder point and reliability.",

            "text": "In this paper, we consider that the supplier can be disrupted at random times and can remain off for a random length of time. The retailer can also be disrupted at random times and can remain off for a random length of time. A manufacturer has one supplier from whom they get a supply of raw materials, parts or sub-assemblies, and one retailer who is involved in keeping stock of the products manufactured by the manufacturer and keeping direct contact with the consumers by selling those. The supplier can be in an ON/OFF state and so too, the retailer. Moreover, the supplier has a random capacity. They cannot always supply the exact amount of supply needed when they get an order. The manufacturer wants to consider all these facts and wants to develop an inventory model and an ordering policy which will minimize their average cost. The manufacturer could backorder if they are not capable of meeting current demand. The assumptions made about the situation are given below.i.Defective and non-defective items will be identified and separated through 100% inspection.ii.There is a pricing policy for defective and non-defective items where defective items are sold at a lower price.iii.Selling price of non-defective items is a function of markup (m1) of production cost (P). Such as S1 = m1P; m1 > 1.iv.Selling price of defective items is a function of markup (m2) and production cost (P) such that S2 = m2P; where, 0 < m2 < 1v.Holding cost is a function of process reliability.vi.The supplier and the retailer can be available and unavailable at random times and the manufacturer does not know the availability of them beforehand.vii.Demand generates according to the Poisson process where the supplier and retailer\u2019s length of ON and OFF periods are exponential random variables.viii.To place an order, the supplier and retailer both need to be in ON state.ix.Supplier\u2019s capacity follows an exponential distribution.x.Average length of supply disruption is much higher than order delivery lead time. For this reason, the lead time for order delivery is considered zero.",

However, the model presented here is an improved version of their model and some new parameters have been introduced. A manufacturer maintains a supplier and their capacity is exponentially distributed considering a parameter (\u03b8) that has a value of 0.025. The manufacturer uses a retailer to sell products, where the retailer can get disrupted. Moreover, the availability or unavailability of the retailer and the supplier is unknown to the manufacturer. Due to these factors, the manager often finds it difficult to meet the demands of the customers in time. As a result, in recent years, they have tried to sort out this problem and develop a special ordering strategy to recover from their current status. Sometimes, a fraction of the produced items are defective. However, the amount of the fraction depends on the operating conditions. Generally, the reliability and fraction of defects have an inverse relationship. This means the higher the reliability, the lower the percentage of defects which, in turn, leads to higher operating costs. Additionally, the defective units can be sold at a low price. So, it is of crucial importance to determine the level of reliability that will maximize total profit for the organization.",

Here, profitability was a function of the order quantity, reorder point and reliability. In a manufacturing system, imperfect production can result in defective items. To improve product quality and thus reduce defective items, process reliability needs to be increased. On the other hand, increasing reliability causes increase in the operating cost and thus decreases profit. Therefore, to maximize profit, an optimum level of reliability needs to be ensured. As we developed our model considering reliability and uncertainty of the process, we can apply this model in imperfect production systems to have a better understanding of a realistic production inventory model.",

Sometimes, communication gap and lack of information sharing between purchase and planning department results in an imbalanced production plan. To produce a single product, hundreds of different components are required. By not having a rigorous inventory policy, sometimes it is very common in apparel industry to not start the production due to delay in some trims even though having most of the components inhoused on time. This kind of scheduling problem can be avoided by addressing the reliability of the suppliers. Additionally, strikes, natural disasters, port congestion, heavy traffic can dirupt the chain in a large extent. For example, in most of the manufacturing industries, China is the biggest supplier of raw materials to the production facilities throughout the world. Every year, due to Chinese New Year (CNY) celebration, all the industries in China get closed for around 10-14 days. These types of supply disruption impact the manufacturing industries heavily if not prepared beforehand with proper inventory policies and contingency plan. Similarly, recent Coronavirus has taken the global manufacturing industries to a standstill situation due to production, supply and demand uncertainty. All these types of disruption and uncertainty issues need to be addressed in every manufacturing industry through some rigorous inventory policies to maximize the total supply chain gain. Through this model, we can address those random supplier\u2019s unavailability and disruption issues.",

In our model we found that demand rate is a the most sensitive parameter and has the highest influence on the final profit function. Thus, it can be summarized that the methodology developed in this paper is a step towards better understanding the situation around us through joint consideration of disruption at both the retailer and the supplier, with consideration of their random capacity and reliability.",

In future studies, the profit function model may be updated considering reliability as a variable having probabilistic characteristics. Additionally, the probability of imperfect products and customer demands can be altered as probabilistic factors for further studies. In this research, it was assumed that the manufacturer had only one supplier. So, the work can be extended with a view to developing an inventory model for multiple suppliers. It has been assumed in this model that an order can only be given at the time when both the supplier and retailer are available. But the manufacturer can order at a time when the supplier is available, but the retailer is unavailable. This factor should be considered to make the model even more robust. In this model, four states CTMC were used to find transition state probability. But a semi-Markov chain can also be applied to get a better result. The model can be further extended to consider production disruption, lead time and shortage as fuzzy random variables. Again, the model developed an objective function which was minimized by using only one computational optimizing procedure, Genetic Algorithm. More algorithms can be used to check whether the model gives the same result every time.",
