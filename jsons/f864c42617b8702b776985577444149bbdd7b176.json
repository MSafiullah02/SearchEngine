Chest CT imaging of the patient (a, c) Chest CT scans obtained at admission show patchy high-density shadows on the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (green boxes in a and c). (b, d) Image obtained 4 days after admission show large ground glass-like high-density shadows on the dorsal segment of the right lung, and patchy cloud-like high-density shadows and consolidation shadows on the left lung (red boxes in b and d). 2019-nCoV). As of today (February 14, 2020), 63,935 cases have been confirmed in China. Currently, clinicians have found some atypical cases with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV. The timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment of these patients will help control the further spread of 2019-nCoV.",

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased at 23 mm/h (normal range, 0-20 mm/h). A swab test and chest CT scanning were performed. Chest CT images illustrated multiple patchy, cloud-like high-density shadows in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe ( Fig. 1 a and c) . Three real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of the oropharyngeal swab specimens were negative for the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. A repeat chest CT performed 4 days after admission displayed that the range of patchy turbidity high-density shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung was significantly enlarged, and turbidity high-density shadows also appeared in the outer zone of the left lower lobe (Figure b & d) . Finally, the fourth RT-PCR 2019-nCoV nucleic acid assay was positive.",

Although this patient's multiple specimen tests were negative, repeat chest CT showed a great progression of cloud-like highdensity shadows in both lungs compared to the previous chest CT. The imaging characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia may be bifocal extra-zonal distribution, bilateral, multifocal 2-3 . With typical clinical presentation and a clear epidemiological history, 2019-nCoV infection may be strongly suspected when chest CT has the characteristics of viral pneumonia despite negative RT-PCR results. In these cases, repeat oropharyngeal swab testing and patient isolation should be carefully considered.",
