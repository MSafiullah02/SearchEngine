It has been shown that patients with severe illness have higher concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, indicating that the severity of the illness could be determined by cytokine storm.2 Patients infected by COVID-19 with cardiac injury have noticeably higher plasma concentrations of IL-6,3, 4 N-terminal fraction of pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and cardiac troponins (cTnI/T). Because cytokine storm is also the main pathophysiologic mechanism in fulminant myocarditis, it is reasonable to consider heart damage due to COVID-19.",

Chest X-ray indicated mild signs of vascular redistribution, with no infiltrations (figure 1B). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viruses in the nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and negative for adenovirus and influenza A and B viruses, with a positive epidemiologic environment (family members with fever and respiratory symptoms in previous days). Laboratory work revealed elevated troponins (TnT, 220-1100 ng/dL) and NT-proBNP (4421 ng/L), mild leukocytosis (14.17 \u00d7 109/L), lymphocytes (2.59 \u00d7 109/L), CRP 10 mg/L, and D-dimer at 24 hours (23 242 ng/mL). Echocardiography disclosed moderate concentric hypertrophy, diminished intraventricular volumes with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction without segmental abnormalities, and moderate pericardial effusion with no clear signs of hemodynamic deterioration. Due to a clinical picture indicative of myocarditis (diffuse concave ST-segment elevation, fever, pericardial effusion, and myocardial thickening) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction without segmental abnormalities, coronary angiography was not performed due to a low clinical suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. In the Coronary Unit, during implantation of a Swan-Ganz catheter, the patient experienced rapid hemodynamic deterioration, exhibiting electrical activity with no pulse and requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emergent pericardiocentesis (drainage of serous fluid), and high-dose vasopressors for hemodynamic recovery.",
