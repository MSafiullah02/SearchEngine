Data visualisation and visual analytics has been identified as a key tool in big data analysis because they draw on the human visual and cognitive capabilities to analyse data quickly, intuitively and interactively. However, current visualisation tools and visual analytical systems fall short of providing a seamless user experience and several improvements could be made to current commercially available visualisation tools. By conducting a systematic literature review, requirements of visualisation tools were identified and categorised into six groups: dimensionality reduction, data reduction, scalability and readability, interactivity, fast retrieval of results, and user assistance. The most common themes found in the literature were dimensionality reduction and interactive data exploration.",

With an estimated 3.7 billion internet users globally (Marr 2018 ) the internet is a significant factor in the generation of data. Google, the most popular search engine, receives at least 5.5 billion search queries per day (Sullivan 2016) and processes 24 petabytes of data per day (Ali et al. 2016) . User generated social media data is another significant contributor to big data, with Facebook reporting 2.32 billion active monthly users (Noyes 2019a) and Twitter reporting 321 million active monthly users with 500 million tweets posted daily (Noyes 2019b) Big data is defined as large, complex, high velocity data sets (Seokyeon et al. 2015) . Big data is characterised by volume, velocity, value, variety, variability, and complexity (Katal et al. 2013) . Due to the nature of these large, heterogeneous data sets, interpretation and comprehension of the data is often difficult, and current data storage and analysis technologies are no longer able to effectively store and analyse such large datasets (Genender-Feltheimer 2018) . However, using big data brings new opportunities for research and new insights across a wide variety of fields (Resnyansky 2019 ) and by visually exploring and analysing the data, unexpected discoveries can be found.",

Image parsing is an efficient means of comprehending large datasets because grouping or clustering of data points, as well as outliers, become apparent. Further, the inclusion of interactive technology and visual analytics allows users to gain more information about specific data points and areas of interest through visual exploration, which facilitates the formation, testing and validation of hypotheses (Elmqvist and Fekete 2010) .",

Dimensionality reduction is a key requirement of big data visualisation (Zou et al. 2016 ) because many of the large datasets that exist today contain multiple dimensions, however, humans can only perceive three dimensions, giving rise to the need for algorithms that can reduce datasets to two or three dimensions which can be visualised. There are a number of statistical algorithms which can achieve this including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) and diffusion maps (Agrawal et al. 2015; Fernandez et al. 2015; Genender-Feltheimer 2018; Gisbrecht and Hammer 2015; Shirota et al. 2017) . Mapping multidimensional datasets into clusters that are represented in two or three dimensions is also common and allows the partitioning of data into similar groups (Keck et al. 2017) . It is useful to maintain the original structures of the data (Fernandez et al. 2015) so that further analysis can be carried out after identifying certain clusters or patterns of interest during the two-or three-dimensional exploration of the data (Keck et al. 2017; Xie et al. 2016) . Advantages of dimensional reduction include easily understood visualisations, reduced data quality challenges, and improved computational efficiency (Genender-Feltheimer 2018).",

Supervised algorithms require a 'training' data set to 'learn' from, and subsequently the model is applied to a second 'scoring' data set. Unsupervised algorithms do not require a training dataset, but rather, are able to detect patterns in the data (Mwangi et al. 2014 ). other deep learning methods.

The ability for a user to interact with a visualisation makes visual exploration of the dataset possible and this has the major advantage of combining both human and machine intelligence (Chen et al. 2019) to uncover unexpected and interesting phenomena within the dataset (Cho et al. 2014 ). The benefits of visual analytics are \"visual perception, interactive exploration, improved understanding, informed steering and intuitive interpretation\" (Liu 2019 ). This has the potential to uncover patterns in the data using a bottom-up approach (Ruan and Zhang 2017) or to test theories and search for evidence within the data using a top-down approach (Genender-Feltheimer 2018; Mwangi et al. 2014) . Visualisation tools should enable the user to drill down into areas of interest within the data (Zhao et al. 2017) to aid in the visual analysis. Several authors write about the need to keep the user informed at each step of the visual analytics process. This gives the user situational awareness and keeps the user informed about the underlying processes being run in order to render the data or return results (Zhao et al. 2017) . Currently, many visualisation tools are a \"Black Box\" and do not give enough feedback to the user. Results are produced without a description of how the results were calculated, and in some visualisation systems, the user is not given the option to select a statistical method of their choice (Seokyeon et al. 2015) .",

Visualisation tools are required to \"squeeze a billion records into a million pixels\" (Bikakis 2018) emphasizing the need for summarisation of data, particularly when creating visualisations. If the dataset is not sufficiently summarised, or if every data point is plotted, this may result in 'over plotting' which is inefficient and it can be difficult to discern the patterns and trends within the data (Li et al. 2016 ). The number of pixels is even lower on mobile device screens, thus the scalability of visualisations for mobile devices are even more important (Li et al. 2016; Molina-Solana et al. 2017) . Furthermore, attempting to plot all data points overloads the users' cognitive capabilities, thus it is important to ensure readability and scalability across all screen sizes and in all contexts (Eldawy et al. 2015) . In order to achieve this, visualisation tools should include zooming; overview and detail; and brushing of the visualisation (Li et al. 2016 ). The visualisation tools should also use the approach of providing a high level overview of the data initially, and subsequently load more detailed data as the user queries and drills down into areas of interest (Agrawal et al. 2015) .",

When the query has finished processing, which may take up to ten minutes, the user is informed and the discrepancies between the original estimate and the final results are displayed to the user (Moritz et al. 2017) . Generally, it is more important to get a broad overview of the data, rather than exact figures, and in this regard, the approximate processing approach works well. Displaying the confidence interval of the estimate during the initial load of the data gives further benefit to this method, as the user is given an estimate and an indication of how accurate the estimate is. This is particularly useful when the results of simple queries are needed urgently (Masiane 2019; Zhao et al. 2017) .",

A possible solution is to make use of data reduction techniques to utilise the \"screen real estate\" efficiently (Yang et al. 2015) . There are a number of ways to reduce the data, including filtering, clustering, and sampling techniques (Masiane 2019) . Examples of sampling techniques that could be used to reduce the dataset include stratified random sampling, systematic random sampling, and quota sampling. Probability sampling techniques select the data in such a way that each data point has an equal probability of being selected. In contrast, non-probability sampling techniques are useful in some cases for the purposes of including at least one data point within each group or category that may be present in the data, meaning that data points which fall into a smaller group or category have a higher chance of being selected than data points which fall into larger categories or groups. This ensures each group is represented in the sample by the inclusion of at least one data point from each group or category (Genender-Feltheimer 2018) .",

Examples of methods to provide the user with assistance include recommending which visualisation techniques are most suitable, given a particular dataset as input (Seokyeon et al. 2015) . Behrisch et al. (2019) recommend calculating statistics as soon as the input data is loaded and displaying the results to the user immediately.

Similarly, the use of colours is a simple way to highlight similarities or differences in the data (Elaiza et al. 2014) . As mentioned in Sect. 4.2, visualisation tools must keep the user informed at each stage of the analysis to give the user situational awareness, inform the user of the progress of the query, and to give the user more control over the analysis (Behrisch et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2017) . Zhao et al. (2017) argue that most visual analytic systems are designed too specifically, thus they are only suitable for a limited range of situations as they restrict data types and data structures. A potential solution to make visualisation systems more dynamic and flexible is through customisation and the use of plug-ins and dynamically linked libraries (Liu 2019) .",
