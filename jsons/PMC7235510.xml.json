Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity play an important role in progression and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010CoV infection with the virus retaining its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and relative humidity (RH) of 40% to 50%. Higher temperatures and higher RH (38\u00b0C, and >95% RH) have been found to reduce virus viability.4, 5\n",

It is noteworthy that the new epicenters of virus showed similar temperature and latitude and were all along the 30\u00b0 to 0\u00b0N\u2033 zone. The diseases then spread to higher temperature areas like India, Thailand, and Middle East, which can be attributed to the global traveling. Weather patterns in COVID\u201019 (5\u00b0C\u201011\u00b0C and 47%\u201070% RH) are similar to those of SARS\u2010CoV mentioned above and known laboratory conditions that favor CoV survival (4\u00b0C, 20%\u201080% RH).\n5\n Nevertheless, the dynamics of viral transmission depend on many other factors like physical property of the virus, outdoor and indoor environments, population densities, hygiene, space, and genetic predispositions, which may be the reason for its spread in relatively warmer areas.6, 7 The presence of central air\u2010conditioning, which tends to maintain a lower ambient room temperature, may play a role in virus spread in closed spaces irrespective of the outside temperature. Lack of hygiene, close contact as seen in high density population areas, poor living conditions with lack of ventilation may be predisposing factors for viral transmission in warmer areas.6, 7\n",
