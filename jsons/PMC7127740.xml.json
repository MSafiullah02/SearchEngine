The DNA genomes of cellular organisms and the majority of DNA viruses are replicated by DNA-dependent DNA polymerases (DdDp). RNA genomes, currently found only in viruses, comprise four types: positive and negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+ and ssRNA\u2212, respectively) viruses, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and RNA viruses that use reverse transcriptase for genome replication. RNA-dependent polymerase is the only enzyme universally conserved in all of the thousands of known non-satellite RNA viruses. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is used to replicate the genomes of viruses with no DNA stage, and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp; reverse transcriptase) is used by viruses with a DNA stage in the life cycle.1\n",

            "text": "Despite the diversity of genomes that they replicate, the TDPPs have remarkable structural conservation. All the RNA-dependent polymerases, and many DNA-dependent polymerases, employ a fold whose organization has been likened to the shape of a cupped right hand with three subdomains, termed fingers, palm and thumb.2 Only the palm subdomain, composed of a four-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with two \u03b1-helices packed beneath, is well conserved among all of these enzymes.3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9. The palm subdomain comprises several ordered sequence motifs, with motifs A, B and C10 being the most prominent. Motifs A and C are conserved in the TDPPs of all cellular organisms and viruses.5., 11., 12., 13. In RdRps, motif A (DX4\u20135D, where X is a non-conserved residue) contains two Asp residues separated by four or five residues, while motif C (GDD) contains an Asp-Asp dipeptide, which is often preceded by a Gly.10 In TDPPs other than RdRps, only the N-terminal Asp residues in motifs A and C are conserved14 at the end of a \u03b2-strand of motif A and in the turn of the \u03b2^\u03b2 hairpin of motif C. These Asp residues are spatially juxtaposed, bind divalent cations, Mg2+ and/or Mn2+, and are crucial for catalysis. Motif B forms a long \u03b1-helix and is conserved in RNA-dependent polymerases, and, at the secondary structure level, in other polymerases.4., 6. Motif B contains a residue (Asn in RdRp) that contributes to the discrimination between dNTPs and NTPs and thus determines whether RNA or DNA is synthesized.6., 15. Hence, all three motifs are indispensable for proper functioning of polymerases. This structural and functional conservation implies that palm subdomains of all TDPPs may have evolved from a common and ancient ancestor. RdRps also share the palm motif D (\u03b1^\u03b2 structure), and motif E (\u03b2^\u03b2 structure), which is located at the palm\u2013thumb interface; these motifs may not be readily recognized in sequences of every RNA virus.",

Counterparts of motifs A, B, and C of the palm subdomain and motif E,10 were tentatively identified in the birnavirus RdRps through comparison with homologs encoded by ssRNA+ viruses.27., 28. However, the highly conserved Asp-Asp dipeptide, which is critical for enzymatic activity, was not evident in motif C of the IPNV RdRp.28 This is in striking contradiction to the replicative competence of birnaviruses.29., 30.\n",

Surprisingly, this conservation was not evident in sensitive profile versus profile dot-plots (Figure 2\n, and data not shown). This is opposed to the conservation between replicases of distantly related insect tetraviruses (HaSV and N\u03b2V) and mammalian viruses of another family (hepatitis E viruses) (Figure 1, Figure 2). Furthermore, when our analysis was extended to database searches, the only statistically significant hit (psi-Blast, Blosum62, no filter, E=0.004) was recorded between the N-terminal \u223c330 aa regions of the putative replicase of TaV and the previously identified RdRp domain of the 845 aa replicase of a dsRNA birnavirus, IPNV.28 This hit was expanded through iterative searches and converted into an alignment between the replicases of TaV and EeV and two birnaviruses, IPNV and IBDV, that contained conserved regions of 530\u2013580 aa residues adjacent to the N terminus of the proteins (Figure 3(a) and (b)\nand data not shown). Using profile HMMER2.1-mediated searches,33 this region in the four viruses was shown to be similar to RdRps of ssRNA+ viruses of the Picornavirus-like supergroup18 and Nidovirales\n34 whose sequence affinity was already documented35 (all top hits in the Genpeptides database with scores better than E=100 were (putative) RdRps) (Figure 4).

In the RHDV RdRp, the G motif occupies a part of the finger subdomain and is flanked by two Lys residues (Lys114 and Lys134) that were predicted to interact with the phosphodiester backbone of the primer in the primer-template duplex.9 One or two conserved basic residues can also be found in the vicinity of the G motif of other viruses listed in Figure 4 (data not shown).

To verify this permutation, we have applied a specially designed computer-assisted protocol that utilizes capabilities of sensitive HMMER and rps-BLAST programs for analyzing artificially permuted sequences. Using this protocol, it was shown that the relocation of the motif C? into the canonical position specifically and selectively converts non-canonical RdRps of the TaV/EeV and IPNV/IBDV lineages into the quasi-canonical RdRps (Figure 4; for details see Materials and Methods and Figure 8, Figure 9).

To address this question, the connectivity of the tertiary structure of the PV RdRp,6 a typical palm-based polymerase belonging to the PF00608 family, was modified to model the permuted C\u2013A\u2013B motif sequence arrangement. To relocate motif C upstream of motif A, the PV structure had to be cut in three loops between the following pairs of elements: \u03b1D and \u03b21, \u03b1H and \u03b22, \u03b23 and \u03b1I. For the permuted structure, three new connections between the following pairs: \u03b1D and \u03b22, \u03b23 and \u03b21, and \u03b1H and \u03b1I, respectively, had to be formed (Figure 5(a) and (b)). All connections affected by this permutation are confined to a restricted loop area opposite the active site where the conserved catalytic aspartate residues (D233 and D328) are positioned (Figure 5(b)). Three new connections could be modeled without major steric clashes, and the C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 distances between the termini of the major secondary structural elements in the actual and artificially permuted structures, 9.58\u201314.27 \u00c5 and 4.26\u201310.40 \u00c5, respectively, are in similar ranges (Figure 5(b) and (c)). Thus, the permuted backbone connectivity is compatible with the spatial organization of the major secondary structure elements of the palm fold and could maintain structural integrity of the subdomain, as was observed for circularly permuted proteins.36., 38.\n",

It was found that the quasi-canonical RdRps comprise a separate, deeply rooted lineage supported by 953 out of 1000 and 78 out of 100 bootstrap trials in the neighbor-joining and parsimonious analyses, respectively (Figure 6\nand data not shown). The RdRps of TaV/EeV and birnaviruses form a distinct cluster because of the sequence conservation over a long region rather than the presence of the unique motif C permutation that was reversed before the phylogenetic analysis. This conservation was originally uncovered in the course of the database searches (see above) and is evident in the alignment shown in Figure 3(b). The actual distance between RdRps of TaV/EeV/birnaviruses and those of other viruses must be even greater than that depicted in this tree, given that the motif C relocation in these quasi-canonical RdRps (Figure 4) has artificially increased the genuine similarity between enzymes of TaV/EeV/birnaviruses and those of other viruses.

Due to a large evolutionary distance between the permuted and canonical RdRps, the three positions that delimit two adjacent permuted subsequences in each replicase have been identified with small margins which are expected to decrease when more related replicases could be analyzed.

Contrary to the current capsid-based classification of TaV,23 and the closely related EeV, within the Tetraviridae family, the replicases of TaV and EeV proved to be significantly different in the domain organization and overall similarity from those of the known tetraviruses HaSV and N\u03b2V (Figure 1, Figure 2). These two groups of viruses therefore employ very different replicative machineries that have diverged relatively early in evolution. With their shared capsid architecture and divergent replicases, TaV/EeV and the well-established tetraviruses enjoy a mosaic relationship (Figure 1) resembling that between Picornavirus-like potyviruses and Alphavirus-like potexviruses.43 On the basis of this parallel and the phylogeny of RdRps (Figure 6), we suggest to re-examine the taxonomic position of TaV and EeV with regard to the Tetraviridae. These viruses may be prototypes for a new family distinct from tetraviruses and not belonging to any existing virus supergroup. A formal proposal to make these changes is to be submitted to the International Virus Taxonomy Committee (T.N.H., K.H.J.G. et al., unpublished results).",

Cluster phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm of Saitou & Nei69 with the Kimura correction70 and were evaluated with 1000 bootstrap trials, as implemented in the ClustalX1.81 program.

The identification of a genuine sequence permutation is straightforward, provided an analyzed sequence returns non-linear, permuted matches with other, canonical homologs upon scanning a sequence database using Blast or other search engine.42 None of these conditions were apparent upon analysis of replicases of TaV, EeV and birnaviruses that differ from the canonical homologs through a permutation of a short internal sub-sequence and profound divergence elsewhere. To meet the challenge of identifying permutations of this complexity, we decided to analyze large spaces of the computer-generated replicase permutants using HMMER2.0133 and rps-BLAST-mediated67 database searches. We made use of an observation that alignment with a highest score between permuted and canonical homologs is produced when permutation is reversed.40., 42., 74. In other words, if two protein families have diverged through permutation of a sub-sequence in the ancestor of one of two families, then back-permutation in the proteins of the affected family produces sequences that outscore the parental sequences upon comparison with the other protein family. It is reasonable to assume further that this back-permutation must also outscore any other possible permutations as they, at the best, can only approach the similarity between the back-permutant and the other protein family.",

To denote a particular permutation, three cut-points (I, J, and L) need to be chosen, where each index represents the position before the residue. For example, if I=5, the first cut-point lies between residues 4 and 5. If I and J represent the beginning and end of the region being moved and L represents the position where this region is inserted (so residues I through J\u22121 are placed between residues L\u22121 and L), and if:1\u2264I<J<L\u2264N+1where N is length of a parental sequence, then relocating the I\u2013J region to L is identical to relocating J\u2013L to I. Values of three indexes vary in the following ranges: for I from 1 to N\u22121, for J from I+1 to N, and for L from J+1 to N+1, for each index with a stride of S. Three indexes can be ordered by 3!=6 ways to yield the same permutation. This means that the number of all possible permuted sequences (permutants) derived from the parental sequence (S=1) is equal to (N+1)N(N\u22121)/6=(N\n3\u2212N)/6. Since the replicases of IPNVJ/IBDV and TaV/EeV contain from 845 aa to 1257 aa, the number of permutants that can be generated is on the order of 108. This number is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the number of sequences in the current version of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein database. To routinely manage the databases of this scale, extensive computational resources would be required (see also below).",

This reduces the number of permuted sequences that are generated by a factor of approximately S\n3. The stride length, S, should be odd so that unique sequences could be easily generated in the second step (see below), and, in practice, a stride length of 9 aa that is significantly smaller than sizes of expected permutations was used.

Though many permutations resulted in the same E\ns value, a plot of the average value of E\no/E\ns over the best K permutations (ordinate) versus\nK values (abscissa) had the general appearance of a decaying exponential (not shown). Using a central difference method, the place where the slope of this curve stayed below 0.1 for 100 contiguous K-values (say K\no) was located. All sequences that ranked higher than K\no were considered top-scoring permutants and were selected for subsequent analysis.",
