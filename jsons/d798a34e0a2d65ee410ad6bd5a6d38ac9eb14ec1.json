Records of children and adolescents treated at our hospital during 1987-2006 with a documented rhinovirus infection were reviewed and compared with patients with other respiratory virus infections. Prospective study included all children !1 month of age admitted to pediatric infectious disease ward during an autumn period. Rhinoviruses were detected by reverse transcription-PCR and/or culture, and sequence analysis was used for virus typing. In the retrospective study, the median age of 580 children with rhinovirus infection was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 1.0-4.3 years), and 27% had an underlying medical condition. Eighty-four children (16% of in-patients) were treated at pediatric intensive care unit. Twenty-one children (4%) had a hospital-acquired rhinovirus infection. In the prospective study, rhinoviruses were detected in 28% of 163 hospital episodes. Acute wheezing illness was diagnosed in 61% of children with rhinovirus and in 31% of children with respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, or no study virus (P < 0.001). One-half of sequence-analyzed rhinovirus strains belonged to the newly identified C group. In conclusion, rhinovirus infections are a frequent cause of pediatric hospitalizations, and they are common also at the intensive care unit. Acute wheezing is the most frequent manifestation in hospital setting, but the range of clinical presentations is wide. Group C rhinoviruses may account for a large part of rhinovirus hospitalizations.",

A major improvement has been the development of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, that enables rapid and sensitive detection of rhinoviruses from respiratory specimens [Hyypi\u20ac a et al., 1998] . Although vaccines or antiviral drugs against rhinoviruses are currently not available, specific diagnosis of rhinovirus infection may be helpful for estimation of prognosis, choosing adequate supportive care, and in prevention of hospital infections. Regarding prognosis, rhinovirus-induced wheezing in early childhood is a major risk factor for subsequent recurrent wheezing or persistent asthma [Kotaniemi-Syrj\u20ac anen et al., 2003; Lemanske et al., 2005; Lehtinen et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2008] .",

Rhinovirus infections occurred most frequently in young children: one-half of all cases were in those younger than 2 years of age. Clinical findings in children with different respiratory viruses overlapped substantially, but certain manifestations were typical for specific viral etiology. Wheezy bronchitis and pneumonia were common discharge diagnoses in children with rhinovirus infection, which is in accordance with other studies [Juv en et al., 2000; Tsolia et al., 2004; Calvo et al., 2007; Cheuk et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2007] . Documented co-infections with other microbes were relatively uncommon, suggesting that rhinovirus infection was the primary cause of hospitalization in most cases. It should be noted, however, that more recently identified respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus were not studied. This dataset is of sufficient size to reveal associations of rhinovirus infections with rare and severe disease manifestations, it involves a long study period to level off epidemiologic variations, and sampling for rhinovirus detection was not limited by any predetermined criteria. Moreover, efficient methods were used for the identification of the study viruses. Potential bias in patient selection is a limitation of the dataset, because samples for virus detection were not taken systematically from all patients. Furthermore, the dataset includes viral findings from previous clinical studies of children with pneumonia [Juv en et al., 2000] , wheezing illness [Jartti et al., 2004] , and leukemia [Koskenvuo et al., 2008] . These data were included in the present study in spite of the fact that they potentially bias the dataset towards these diseases, because their exclusion would have caused an opposite effect. Comparison dataset of children with other respiratory viruses was partly from different time period than that for rhinoviruses, but we do not consider that as a substantial cause of bias in comparisons of clinical picture.",

In the present study, rhinoviruses were common in children at pediatric intensive care unit, and 19 rhinovirus-positive children needed ventilator therapy. Six cases were documented at neonatal intensive care unit. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures and chest X-rays were done in a large proportion of children with rhinovirus infection. WBCs and serum CRP levels were increased often, which is not the case in children with influenza or RSV [Peltola et al., 2003 [Peltola et al., , 2006a . These findings suggest that rhinovirus infections may be severe or they associate with severe bacterial infections. Invasive bacterial infections were, however, rarely confirmed by blood or cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Looking the other way around, previously healthy children with invasive pneumococcal infection during autumn, and children with leukemia and documented bacterial sepsis, may be often positive for rhinoviruses or other respiratory viruses [Peltola et al., 2006b; Koskenvuo et al., 2007] .",

Similarly, in other studies rhinoviruses have been detected by RT-PCR in 15-30% and by culture in 0-5% of individuals with no respiratory symptoms [Jartti et al., 2008a] . Nevertheless, 85% of rhinoviruspositive children in the present study had respiratory symptoms, and other than respiratory infections were recorded as discharge diagnosis rarely. Viral copy numbers were lower in asymptomatic than symptomatic children. These findings suggest that in most rhinovirus positive cases with respiratory symptoms, rhinovirus infection was the likely cause of hospitalization. Asymptomatic rhinovirus findings were from older children, and viral loads were highest in the youngest children. This is in accordance with our previous study of rhinoviruses in families, where asymptomatic infections occurred in school-aged children and adults as a result of transmission from symptomatic young children [Peltola et al., 2008] . Studies with repetitive sampling show that PCR-positivity for specific rhinovirus types is of relatively brief duration [Peltola et al., 2008; Jartti et al., 2008b] .",

In our study, half of the strains belonged to the C group according to sequence analysis of the 5 0 noncoding region. Notably, analysis of this region allows grouping of strains by the species level, but not determination of virus types, which would have needed sequencing of the capsid regions. Number of study children was too low for comparison of clinical manifestations between rhinovirus groups. There is limited earlier evidence that clinical associations, such as the frequency of pneumonia, may differ between the newly identified rhinoviruses and the previously identified ones [Renwick et al., 2007] , but further study would be needed to determine the clinical impact of group C rhinoviruses.",
