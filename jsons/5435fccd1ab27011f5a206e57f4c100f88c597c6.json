Alongside investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the fundamental physiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and rational design of effective therapies. Here, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the immune system and the subsequent contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression. From nascent reports describing SARS-CoV-2, we make inferences on the basis of the parallel pathophysiological and immunological features of the other human coronaviruses targeting the lower respiratory tract -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Finally , we highlight the implications of these approaches for potential therapeutic interventions that target viral infection and/or immunoregulation.",

            "text": "The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) likely occurred from a zoonotic transmission in China in December 2019, linked to a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals. The causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is capable of human-to-human transmission and spread rapidly to other parts of China and then to other locations. By 24 March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had infected more than 381,000 people across 195 countries/regions and killed more than 16,000: a pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization 1 . Daily reports of sharp rises in the number of new cases continue to emerge from many countries/regions, but efforts to overcome the virus are hampered by a lack of knowledge of several important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from pathogen biology to host response and treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the host-pathogen biology of COVID-19 as this will offer important insights into treatment and management of the disease, including identification of new therapies. Here, we review the literature on SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, its interaction with target cells and the immune response to the virus, including the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression. Specifically, we highlight the implications of specific features of the infection for promising therapeutic interventions that could target the virus or the dysfunctional immune response. Moreover, we discuss how studies focused on the adaptive immune response will be crucial in informing the development of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.",

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus. Its closest relative among human coronaviruses is SARS-CoV, with 79% genetic similarity 3 . However, among all known coronavirus sequences, SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13, with 98% similarity 4 , and coronavirus sequences in the pangolin (a scaly anteater) also share high similarity 5 .",

On infection, the median incubation period is approximately 4-5 days before symptom onset [6] [7] [8] [9] , with 97.5% of symptomatic patients developing symptoms within 11.5 days 8 . At the point of hospital admission, patients with COVID-19 typically exhibit a fever and dry cough; less commonly, patients also experience difficulty in breathing, muscle and/or joint pain, headache/dizziness, diarrhoea, nausea and the coughing up of blood 6, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Within 5-6 days of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 viral load reaches its peak -significantly earlier than that of the related SARS-CoV, where viral load peaks at about 10 days after symptom onset [16] [17] [18] [19] . Severe COVID-19 cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), on average around 8-9 days after symptom onset 11, 20 . The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection closely resembles that of SARS-CoV infection, with aggressive inflammatory responses strongly implicated in the resulting damage to the airways 21 . Therefore, disease severity in patients is due to not only the viral infection but also the host response. The pattern of increasing severity with age is also broadly consistent with the epidemiology of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 6, 11, 14 .",

Earlier work on SARS-CoV demonstrated that this virus principally targets airway epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages in the lung, all of which express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host target receptor used by SARS-CoV [24] [25] [26] (Fig. 2) . As SARS-CoV-2 uses the same entry receptor, these cell subsets are likely targeted by this virus 4, 27, 28 . SARS-CoV infection reduces ACE2 expression in lung cells. Because loss of pulmonary ACE2 function is associated with acute lung injury, virus-induced ACE2 downregulation may be important for disease pathology [29] [30] [31] [32] . ACE2 has been shown to regulate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 32 . Therefore, a reduction in ACE2 function after viral infection could result in a dysfunction of the RAS, which influences blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte balance, and enhance inflammation and vascular permeability in the airways.",

The spike (S) protein is expressed on the surface of the virus particles, giving the characteristic 'crown' appearance. The S protein comprises two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 subunit consists of an amino-terminal domain and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which in SARS-CoV spans from amino acid residue 318 to amino acid residue 510 (reFs [35] [36] [37] ). The RBD binds to ACE2 as its host cell target receptor, which starts the infection process 4 . RBD binding to ACE2 triggers endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and exposes it to endosomal proteases 38 . The S2 subunit consists of a fusion peptide (FP) region and two heptad repeat regions: HR1 and HR2 (reFs 39, 40 ). Within the endosome, the S1 subunit is cleaved away, exposing the fusion peptide, which inserts into the host membrane. The S2 region then folds in on itself to bring the HR1 and HR2 regions together. This leads to membrane fusion and releases the viral package into the host cytoplasm.",

            "text": "One pathway for the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 is to block the host target ACE2 receptor or TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3) . Currently, there are compounds that target these molecules that have been clinically approved for other indications. For example, machine learning algorithms predicted that baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, could inhibit ACE2-mediated endocytosis 45 . Another JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, will be tested in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 later this year 46 . An alternative strategy is to deliver high concentrations of a soluble form of ACE2 that could potentially reduce virus entry into target host cells. This principle is being tested with APN01, a recombinant form of ACE2 developed by APEIRON that is currently in clinical trials 47 . Monoclonal antibodies targeting the When severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells expressing the surface receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2, the active replication and release of the virus cause the host cell to undergo pyroptosis and release damageassociated molecular patterns, including ATP, nucleic acids and ASC oligomers. These are recognized by neighbouring epithelial cells, endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages, triggering the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, IP-10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP1\u03b1), MIP1\u03b2 and MCP1). These proteins attract monocytes, macrophages and T cells to the site of infection, promoting further inflammation (with the addition of IFN\u03b3 produced by T cells) and establishing a pro-inflammatory feedback loop. In a defective immune response (left side) this may lead to further accumulation of immune cells in the lungs, causing overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which eventually damages the lung infrastructure. The resulting cytokine storm circulates to other organs, leading to multi-organ damage. In addition, non-neutralizing antibodies produced by B cells may enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), further exacerbating organ damage. Alternatively , in a healthy immune response (right side), the initial inflammation attracts virus-specific T cells to the site of infection, where they can eliminate the infected cells before the virus spreads. Neutralizing antibodies in these individuals can block viral infection, and alveolar macrophages recognize neutralized viruses and apoptotic cells and clear them by phagocytosis. Altogether, these processes lead to clearance of the virus and minimal lung damage, resulting in recovery. G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor. \u25c0 Nature reviews | Immunology S protein may also inhibit virus entry or fusion and are further discussed in the section entitled B cell immunity. Nafamostat mesylate 48, 49 and camostat mesylate 44 are known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and are currently approved in several countries/regions to treat other conditions. While there are no clinical trials specifically testing these drugs against COVID-19 at the time of writing, when camostat mesylate was tested on SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a patient, it prevented entry of the virus into lung cells 44, 50 . If this approach is validated, rapid repurposing of these drugs will be effective and timely in the fight against COVID-19.",

IL-6 levels in these patients continue to increase over time and are relatively more elevated in non-survivors than survivors 60 . Notably, there exists a highly inflammatory monocyte-derived FCN1 + macrophage population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe but not mild COVID-19 (reF. 61 ). Also, patients with severe disease show a significantly higher percentage of CD14 + CD16 + inflammatory monocytes in peripheral blood than patients with mild disease 62 . These cells secrete inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the cytokine storm, including MCP1, IP-10 and MIP1\u03b1 (Fig. 1) .",

Antagonism occurs at various stages of the interferon signalling pathway, including by preventing PRR recognition of viral RNA 63-65 , by preventing PRR signalling through TBK1/inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB kinase subunit-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), TRAF3 and IRF3 (reFs 63,66 ), by preventing downstream interferon signalling through STAT1 (reF. 67 ) and by promoting host mRNA degradation and inhibiting host protein translation 68 . It is very likely that at least some of these pathways are conserved in SARS-CoV-2. Antagonism of the interferon response aids viral replication, resulting in increased release of pyroptosis products that can further induce aberrant inflammatory responses.",

These may result in myocardial damage and circulatory failure observed in some patients 69 . Older people (those aged over 60 years) and people with co-morbidities are more likely to develop such a dysfunctional immune response that causes pathology and also fails to successfully eradicate the pathogen. The exact reasons for this are unclear, although one reason may be an ageing lung microenvironment causing altered dendritic cell maturation and migration to the lymphoid organs 70 , and thereby defective T cell activation. In contrast, children tend not to develop severe disease despite being capable of experiencing high viral titres 71 . Across all age groups younger than 18 years, more than 50% of children experienced mild symptoms or were asymptomatic, with less than 6% of children developing severe symptoms 72 . Thus, while the aforementioned studies represent important inroads, a full picture of the critical host immune factors that underlie the development of severer inflammatory responses in some patients remains poorly defined.",

            "text": "It remains controversial whether virus persistence is necessary to drive the ongoing damage. The peak of viral titres in respiratory tract samples might occur even before symptom onset of pneumonia in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections 17, 19 . However, a large retrospective cohort study showed that viral RNA was detectable in non-survivors up until the point of death, suggesting a correlation between virus persistence and poor disease outcome 60 . As viral RNA may linger even after active infection, and is not representative of the infectivity of the virus, whether the poor disease outcome is directly due to large amounts of infectious particles is speculative at this moment. Furthermore, earlier studies of SARS-CoV found that the virus may infect other targets besides lung cells. Notably, virus was found in T lymphocytes 73 , macrophages [74] [75] [76] and monocyte-derived dendritic cells 77 can be passed through customized columns that are specially designed to trap pro-inflammatory cytokines, before the purified blood is passed back into patients. 79, 80 . A clinical trial of the IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab is also under way to test its efficacy 81 , and sarilumab is also being explored 82 . Other clinical trials are also testing the effects of targeting granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), including the use of gimsilumab 83 , lenzilumab 84 and namilumab 85 . Another novel adjunctive therapy is cytosorb 86 , which acts by absorbing a broad spectrum of cytokines, DAMPs and PAMPs in order to reduce their circulating levels and ameliorate immunopathology. Thalidomide, an agent with immunomodulatory properties, has also been successfully administered to a single patient with COVID-19 (reF. 87 ). As a result, two clinical trials have now been initiated to test its potential to reduce lung injury 88,89 . TNF antagonism was suggested but not tested in the context of SARS-CoV infection, and it has not yet been tested in patients with COVID-19 (reF. 90 ). A small open-label, non-randomized study suggested that a combination of hydroxychloroquine (a known antimalarial agent) and azithromycin (a common antibiotic) may be beneficial for treating patients with severe COVID-19 (reF. 91 ). Although hydroxychloroquine's effect on direct inhibition of the virus 92 and its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities are known 93 , whether these mechanisms play a role against COVID-19 remains to be determined 94 .

CD4 + T cells are also responsible for cytokine production to drive immune cell recruitment.

Within 4-8 days after symptom onset, antibody responses to S protein are found 111, 112 . Neutralizing antibody responses, likely to the S protein, begin to develop by week 2, and most patients develop neutralizing antibodies by week 3 (reFs 113, 114 ). Given that viral titres peak earlier for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV [16] [17] [18] [19] , antibody responses may also arise earlier. It seems that a subset of patients may not develop longlasting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (reF. 115 ). It remains unknown whether these patients are susceptible to reinfection, of which there are sporadic reports 116, 117 .

Efforts are under way to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, using approaches including phage library display, traditional mouse immunization and hybridoma isolation, and cloning of B cell sequences from convalescent human patients [129] [130] [131] [132] . SARS-CoV does not appear to have strong mechanisms to escape or prevent antibody neutralization, such as glycan shielding of the receptor-binding site against antibody binding 133 . This is further corroborated by the fact that patients with SARS-CoV infection were generally capable of developing neutralizing antibodies. A recombinant S protein fragment that included the RBD of SARS-CoV showed the highest immunogenicity relative to other recombinant S protein fragments tested, suggesting that the immune system is capable of targeting neutralizing epitopes effectively 134 . Thus, if SARS-CoV-2 behaves like SARS-CoV in this respect, it is likely that these efforts will be successful in developing neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.",

For example, pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses may exacerbate SARS-CoV infections through antibody-dependent enhancement [138] [139] [140] . Also, previous studies in animal models showed that in SARS-CoV infection, neutralizing antibodies Fig. 4 | Sequence alignment and structural comparison of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. a | Sequence alignment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, with conserved amino acid residues shown in black and non-conserved residues shown in colours. b | The 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 (Protein Data Bank ID 6VSB 42 , peach ribbon) is superimposed on the SARS-CoV receptor-binding motif (RBM) complex with the neutralizing antibody (nAb; red ribbon) interfacing with the RBM (Protein Data Bank 2DD8 (reF. 151 ), purple ribbon).

In addition, a correlation has been observed where development of ARDS coincides with antiviral IgG seroconversion in 80% of patients 19 . Patients who developed neutralizing antibodies to S protein earlier in infection had a higher rate of disease; it took an average of only 14.7 days for patients who died of infection to reach their peak levels of neutralizing antibody activity, as opposed to 20 days for patients who went on to recover 142 . Similarly, for MERS, patients with severer disease appear to have higher antibody titres than those with mild disease 143, 144 , although one study argues that it is a delay in the development of antibody responses that is associated with disease 145 . The binding of antibody-virus immune complexes to activating Fc receptors on alveolar macrophages could induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-8 and MCP1, which add to the immunostimulatory milieu 146 . Such complexes may also activate the complement system and lead to further unwanted inflammation 141 . As a result, it is important to consider engineering therapeutic antibodies with little or no pro-inflammatory activity but that retain their virus-neutralizing capacity 147 . For instance, alterations could be made to the Fc region and/or its glycosylation to change its binding affinity for activating Fc receptors 146, 148 .",

(2) Protease inhibitors against the serine protease TMPRSS2 can prevent spike protein cleavage, which is necessary for viral fusion into the host cell. Blocking either ACE2 interaction or viral fusion could prevent the virus from infecting the host cell.
