A variant PEDV strain that differs from strain CV777 causes prevalent PEDV infections which commercial vaccines based on CV777 cannot provide complete protection. In this study, we designed a new vaccine based on the epidemic PEDV strain AH2012/12, adjuvanted with flagellin, a mucosal adjuvant that induces mucosal and systemic production of IgA. Three groups of pregnant sows were immunized twice, with a 14-day interval, with PEDV adjuvanted with flagellin, PEDV alone, or PBS before farrowing, and newborn piglets from each group were selected and challenged with PEDV. Immunization with this vaccine elicited high levels of IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies in the serum and colostrum of sows, and newborn piglets were protected against PEDV while suckling. This study should guide the prevention and control strategies for PEDV infection, thereby reducing the losses associated with this virus.",

At the end of 2010, a major increase in PED outbreaks occurred in the pig-producing provinces of China, despite continued use of the available vaccines based on the CV777 strain of PEDV. Inactivated or attenuated vaccines for PEDV (strain CV777, subgroup GI-a) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were approved in China in 1995 and 1998, respectively. In 2015, a trivalent vaccine consisting of attenuated PEDV (strain CV777, subgroup GI-a), TGEV, and porcine rubulavirus (PoRV) and a dual attenuated vaccine combining TGEV and PEDV (strain ZJ08, subgroup GI-b) were officially launched on the market [28] . Recent epidemics may be attributable to variants of PEDV [13, 22] . In a previous study, an epidemic PEDV field strain, AH2012/12 (accession no. KU646831), from a pig farm in Anhui Province reporting severe diarrhea was isolated in our laboratory and serially propagated in cell culture for over 50 passages [12] . This strain is most closely related to emergent PEDV strains in America [12] and is reported to be highly pathogenic in newborn piglets [12] . Therefore, we prepared an inactivated PEDV vaccine based on strain AH2012/12 to develop an effective preventive and control measure against PEDV.",

Flagellin is a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) ligand, suggesting its potential utility as an adjuvant [20] . Unlike many TLR agonists, flagellin tends to produce mixed Th1 and Th2 cell responses rather than a strongly polarized Th1 response [16] . It has been reported that the mucosal administration of flagellin increases the levels of mucosal and systemic immunoglobulin (IgA) [14, 18] .",

At 5 days post-farrowing, five piglets (1.35-1.55 kg) were randomly selected from each sow in a treatment group. Numbered piglets were housed in isolation rooms and artificially fed with milk. Then, the piglets were orally challenged with 100 median lethal doses (LD 50 ) of PEDV AH2012/12 (passage 10, 10 7 TCID 50 , 2 ml). Prior to challenge, sera were collected from the piglets for the detection of PEDV-Nprotein-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. The challenged piglets were monitored at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h post-challenge for clinical signs of diarrhea or death.",

Four-to 13-day-old piglets are predominantly protected from PEDV infection by specific IgG and IgA antibodies in the colostrum and milk of immune sows, and the duration of immunity depends on the antibody titers of the mother [25] .

Considering the high degree of amino acid sequence similarity of the N proteins among different PEDV strains and the high immunogenicity of this protein, and its ability to induce both T cell and B cell immune responses, PEDV-N-proteinspecific antibody titers were evaluated in our study to assess the immune responses of immunized animals.",

In this study, we used PEDV and FliC separately rather than as a fusion protein of the target antigen and FliC [20, 21] . This method was used to enable separate modification of PEDV while preserving the antigenicity of the virus. In this study, we only evaluated the efficacy of the vaccines through the intranasal route and not the intramuscular route. Because FliC is a mucosal adjuvant, we hypothesized that nasal immunization could efficiently induce a mucosal immune response, which could provide better mucosal immunity against PEDV infection.

However, the significant differences in antibody titers between the viral immunization group and the control group indicated the success of the experiment. Meanwhile, the significantly higher levels of PEDV-specific IgA antibodies in the colostrum partially explains the enhanced levels of PEDV-specific IgA antibodies in serum of piglets delivered from Vac201-FliC-immunized sows. Sows immunized with Vac201-FliC showed not only enhanced humoral immune responses but also improved cellular immunity compared with those in the groups immunized with PBS or Vac201. The significantly more potent immune responses induced by Vac201-FliC resulted in a mortality rate as low as 13.33% after challenge with PEDV strain AH2012/12.
