Among these structural proteins, the S protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 (ACE2) present on the surface of human cells, especially the alveolar type II cells that highly express this receptor, and then the virus enters the host lung cells [5], [6]. Effective immune responses against viral infections depend on IFN-I production from innate immune cells and subsequently cell mediated immunity through T helper 1 and cytotoxic T cells [5]. So, as the virus enters the cell, its genome is recognized by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3), TLR7-9, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), Melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), then signaling pathways are initiated. Following these incidences, large amounts of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines are secreted [7], [8], [9], [10]. Following these inflammatory conditions in the lungs, which also increase with the proliferation of the virus, a sharp increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF\u03b1 have been reported in patients with COVID, known as the cytokine storm [11]. This cytokine storm is similar to that seen in SARS and MERS and is caused by the lack of proper regulation of inflammatory immune responses [12], [13].",

Pathogenic T cells produce inflammatory cytokines after activation and subsequently inflammatory monocytes and other leukocytes migrate to the lung [15]. Increased neutrophil counts have been reported as a symptom in a number of patients [2]. These activated immune cells may cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in complications such as pneumonia, loss of lung function, ARDS, and even death (Fig. 1\nA) [5], [12], [13], [14]. Since ARDS is recognized as one of the leading causes of mortality in patients and appears to be caused by cytokine storm, so, suppression of this inflammation may cause decrease inflammatory cytokine production and consequently reduce inflammation and lung injury. As has been shown, the use of Anti-IL6 in patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia can be useful and has been approved in China [16]. Currently, there is no approved treatment for SARS-CoV-2, and usually supportive treatments such as the use of ventilators and muscle relaxants were used for these patients [6], [16], [17]. Numerous therapeutic interventions have been performed to treat ARDS, but since the mechanisms of damage in ARDS are complex and diverse, it seems that therapeutic strategies that target a single pathway or mediator cannot be useful in achieving therapeutic outcome [17]. Therefore, interventions that target several aspects of immunopathogenesis and associated injuries, can be helpful to find the appropriate treatment strategy.",

One of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy that previous studies have shown satisfactory results for this [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. MSCs are the multipotent cells that can be obtained from different tissues such as, adipose tissue and bone marrow. These cells have the self-renewing capacity and can be differentiated into chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic lineages [25]. Several features of these cells have made them an appealing candidate for the treatment of many diseases, including ARDS.\u2022Immunomodulatory properties: MSCs able to alter the function of the immune cells and modulate the immune response [17]. For example, In LPS-induced ARDS animal models, it has been shown that, MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce inflammation-induced lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. These cells affect the macrophages by releasing prostaglandin E2 (PG-E2), and reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and increase IL-10 production. IL-10 reduced neutrophils recruitment to the lungs and attenuated inflammatory cytokine production [20], [22], [24]. MSCs can also increase regulatory T cells and alter the phenotype of macrophages to M2 macrophages [17].\u2022Tissue repair characteristic: MSCs also have the potential to repair tissue and can prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them, especially type II alveolar cells by producing growth factors such as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This characteristic is important because people with ARDS develop pulmonary fibrosis even after surviving the acute phase of the disease [19], [21], [26]. MSCs can restore epithelial protein permeability by secretion of angiopoietin-1. These cells can increase phagocytosis capacity of the macrophages by transferring the microvesicles [17].\u2022Some studies shown that MSCs could imply antiviral activity. It was shown that gammaherpesvirus infected MSCs could limit the replication of the virus after sensing its DNA by cGAS and initiation of the STING-TBK1 signaling pathway. This pathway that is resulted in IFN-\u03b3 production along with IFN-\u03b3 independent manner could be responsible for the anti-viral response of the MSCs [27]. In addition, some studies shown that IDO, which expressed by MSCs, could responsible for anti-viral activity of the MSCs [28], [29], [30]. IDO-positive MSCs triggered by inflammatory cytokines demonstrated antimicrobial effector function against pathogens such as viruses [28]. In a study performed in 2011, it was shown that IFN-\u03b3 stimulated the expression of the IDO in MSCs and the replication of the CMV and HSV-1 were decreased [29].\n",

            "text": "But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because it has been shown that MSC-derived exosomes apply the same effects of MSCs [31]. Khatri et al. performed an in vitro study and demonstrated that MSC derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) transferred the mRNAs and miRNAs into the lung epithelial cells and reduced the apoptosis of these cells and inhibited influenza virus replication in them. For the confirmation of the results they used a pig model of the influenza virus. It was shown that after MSC-EVs administration, the replication of the virus in the lung, pro-inflammatory cytokines production and virus-induced lung lesion were significantly decreased [32]. In a study performed in 2018, intravenous injection of MSC-exosomes reduced the TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 in the lung. Another study mentioned that these exosomes could decrease endothelial cell apoptosis and IL-6 production. An increase in IL-10 production was also observed [33]. In addition to this, due to the specific structure of the exosomes, miRNAs as well as various drugs can be inserted into them. Then, after administration of these exosomes, they can be trapped in the lung tissue and reached to the target cells. These miRNAs or drugs can target the specific molecules inside the infected cells and diminish local inflammation or prevent apoptosis of the lung cells [34]. In a Song et al. study, it was showed that pretreatment of the MSCs with IL-1\u03b2 augmented their immunomodulatory effects. Because their exosomes transfer of miR-146a to the target cells [35]. Other advantages of the exosomes include ease of access, lack of problems associated to cell maintenance and injections, proper size, and finally the nature of their phospholipid membranes, which enable them to fuse with the target cell membrane and transfer the cargo into the cytoplasm. Additionally, this special structure protects the contents of the exosomes from degradation [36].",

In addition, the immunophenotype of MSCs will be confirmed by measurement of CD73, CD90, CD105, CD14, CD45, CD34, and HLA-DR cell surface marker using flowcytometry. After the adaptation of the cells with serum-free medium the supernatants of them can be collected. Then, a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade method should be used for the isolation of the exosomes from the supernatants, as a medicinal product [37]. The next step is to characterize the exosomes. For this purpose, the size distribution of isolated exosomes will be evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and NanoSight, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The morphology of these vesicles will be determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. In addition, the expression of exosome membrane specific markers including CD9, CD63 and CD81 will be assessed using western blot or flowcytometry.",

            "text": "Since COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has not been developed for it [6], so, numerous research studies are needed to find potential therapies to control the virus as soon as possible. Because SARS-CoV-2 has high transmission potential and spreads rapidly throughout the world and causes many deaths. Since the pathogenesis of this disease was identified partially in previous studies and there are similarities between its pathogenesis with that of other viruses in this family and some bacterial infections and can cause lung injury with ARDS [1], [5], [14], so, investigation of the therapeutic approaches that can suppress inflammation, cytokine storm and ARDS can be helpful in finding a novel therapeutic approach for this disease. Therefore, the use of MSCs as one of the immunomodulating and tissue regenerating cells that have previously shown satisfactory effects on ARDS and cytokine storms [19], [21], [22], [23], [24], [39] could be considered. Since these cells exert their effects in a variety of ways, such as exosomes secretion, the use of their exosomes can be considered as a cell-free therapy [31]. Because these exosomes can have anti-inflammatory effects on lung tissue by transferring mRNAs, miRNAs, and various proteins from its secretory cell to the target cell [40]. As previously shown, these exosomes can reduce inflammatory cytokines, increase regulatory cytokines and suppress inflammation [34]. Monsel et al. also showed that MSC-exosomes could increase survival of alveolar type II cells by increasing intracellular ATP levels [41]. So we introduced this hypothesis in order to further study in the future and hope to see satisfactory results.",

(A) SARS-CoV-2 infected type II alveolar epithelial cells or other target cells, which express ACE2. The influx of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells induced by secretion of the chemokines. Accumulation of the inflammatory cells resulted in production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that knowns as cytokine storm. Cytokine storm is the main cause of ARDS in COVID-19. These inflammatory response may cause apoptosis of the alveolar cells, lung fibrosis, edema, and organ failure. (B) MSCs and their exosomes suppress inflammation and reduce inflammation-induced lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. These cells affect the macrophages and alter the phenotype of macrophages to M2 macrophages by releasing PG-E2. MSCs also reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and increase IL-10 production. IL-10 reduced neutrophils recruitment to the lungs. MSCs also have the potential to repair tissue by producing KGF, VEGF, and HGF. These cells involved in pathogen clearance through releasing LL-37.",
