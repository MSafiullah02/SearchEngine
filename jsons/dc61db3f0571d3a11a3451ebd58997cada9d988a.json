            "text": "A highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) appeared in China and spread rapidly to neighbor countries, which have led to great economic losses to the pig industry. In the present study, we isolated a PEDV using Vero cells and serially propagated 100 passages. PEDV SDSX16 was characterized in vitro and in vivo. The viral titers increased to 10 7.6 TCID 50 /mL (100th) by serial passages. The spike (S) gene and the whole gene of the SDSX16 virus was fully sequenced to assess the genetic stability and relatedness to previously identified PEDV. Along with successive passage in vitro, there were 18 nucleotides (nt) deletion occurred in the spike (S) gene resulting in a deletion of six amino acids when the SDSX16 strain was passaged to the 64th generation, and this deletion was stable until the P100. However, the ORF1a/b, M, N, E, and ORF3 genes had only a few point mutations in amino acids and no deletions. According to growth kinetics experiments, the SDSX16 deletion strain significantly enhanced its replication in Vero cells since it was passaged to the 64th generation. The animal studies showed that PEDV SDSX16-P10 caused more severe diarrhea and vomiting, fecal shedding, and acute atrophic enteritis than SDSX16-P75, indicating that SDSX16-P10 is enteropathogenic in the natural host, and the pathogenicity of SDSX16 decreased with successive passage in vitro. However, SDSX16-P10 was found to cause lower levels of cytokine expression than SDSX16-P75 using real-time PCR and flow cytometry, such as IL1\u03b2, IL6, IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, indicating that SDSX16-P10 might inhibit the expression of cytokines. Our data indicated that successive passage in vitro resulted in virulent attenuation in vivo of the PEDV variant strain SDSX16.",

One PEDV isolate designated as SDSX16 was successfully isolated from the feces of a naturally infected piglet. This sample was originated from a commercial swine farm located in Shandong Province and was obtained on September 16, 2016. This SDSX16 virus and it could produce distinct CPEs from passages 5 (P5), typical of PEDV infection, such as cell fusion, syncytia formation, and detachment in infected Vero cells. We then investigated whether the isolate could be efficiently cultivated and maintained in cultured cells. To do this, the isolated PEDV strain SDSX16 was serially passaged in Vero cells for a total of 100 passages (P1 to P100). The time for the onset of CPE was typically 24 h and prominent CPE was observed within 48 h post-inoculation. The development of CPE was faster in later passages. The visible CPE appeared at 18 h and became predominant by 36 h. Virus propagation was confirmed by detecting PEDV antigens by IFA using an anti-PEDV spike-specific monoclonal antibody. The distinct staining pattern for typical syncytia formation was distributed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, neither CPE nor spike-specific monoclonal antibody staining was detected in mock-inoculated cells. Examples of CPE, and corresponding IFA images in cells inoculated with passages SDSX16-P10 and -P64, are shown in Figure 1 . The titer of the SDSX16 was measured every ten generations. The virus titers ranged from 10 4.15 to 10 4.50 TCID 50 /mL up to SDSX16-P5, and the peak viral titer reached 10 7.6 TCID 50 /mL after passage 100. The titer of SDSX16-P70 (7.44 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) was approximately 10-fold higher than that of SDSX16-P60 (6.22 log 10 TCID 50 /mL). By retrospective testing, we found that the titer of SDSX16-P64 (7.22 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) was significantly higher than that of SDSX16-P63 (Figure 2A ). The growth kinetics study further showed that SDSX16 replicated rapidly and efficiently in Vero cells, reaching a maximum titer >10 7.0 TCID 50 /mL by 48 h of inoculation, and the titer of SDSX16-P64 began to be significantly higher than the titer of SDSX16-P63 by 18 h of inoculation ( Figure 2B ).

The phylogenetic tree ( Figure 4A ) revealed that these PEDV strains could be divided into Subgroup I and Subgroup II. Amino acid analysis indicated that the SDSX16 isolate shared 93.5%~94.9%, 97.5%~98.4%, and 98.5%~99% identity to Subgroup I, Subgroup IIa, and Subgroup IIb, respectively. The major variable region of the S gene was the S1 domain. Compared with Subgroup I (CV777 and DR13) and Subgroup IIb (SDSX16, SD2014, and PC22A-P10 et al.) [14, 18, 19, 33] isolates exhibited an insertion of five amino acids at 59-62 position, 140 position, as well as the deletion of two amino acid at 163-164 position ( Figure 4B ). The same insertions and deletions have been found in other variant strains isolated, indicating that epidemics are caused by variant strains in many countries. Moreover, in comparison with the CV777 strain, some amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing region of the core of epitope (COE) (499-638aa) were observed [34, 35] and the regions of the aligned sequences, corresponding to these regions were COE (514-642aa, Figure 4C ). The sequence analysis revealed that the other variant strains had the same COE mutations. The S gene of SDSX16 at different passage levels (SDSX16 P10-P100 GenBank number: MN241452-MN241464) were analyzed. The results showed that the spike gene had an 18 nt deletion resulting in the deletion of 6 amino acids when the SDSX16 was passaged to the P64, and this deletion was stable until the P100 ( Figure 4D Supplementary Table S1 . Interestingly, the amino acid sequence analysis results of SDSX16-P63, -P64, -P75 showed no mutations in ORF1a/b, M, N, E, and ORF3 genes. Also, the S gene of SDSX16-P64 mainly lost six amino acids than the -P63 S gene and the S gene of -P75 had no amino acid deletion or addition compared to the S gene of -P64. These results suggest that the biggest difference in the genomes of SDSX16-P64 and -P63 is the 6 amino acid deletion in -P64.",

We found that piglets (group A) orally challenged with of SDSX16-P10 (10 6 TCID 50 /piglet), developed diarrhea at 18 h, furthermore, the infected piglets presented with anorexia and depression, and the piglets began to exhibit watery diarrhea at 2 days post-challenge ( Figure 5A ). Two piglets died at 2 days post-challenge and all piglets died at 5 days post-challenge in group A ( Figure 5B) . Whereas, the piglets (group B) started to vomit 24 h after orally inoculated with the -P30 and showed diarrhea at 30 h and some animal's clinical signs of vomiting after suckling. However, there was no significant difference in the clinical examination between groups C and D, infected by -P63, and -P64, respectively, and piglets were found to have slight diarrhea at 48 h. The piglets' group E challenged with P75 virus was not showing any significant diarrhea symptom. No, any clinical signs were observed in group F. In this animal experiment study, there was a significant decrease in weight post-challenge in the P10, P30 infected group, whereas the uninfected piglets gained weight ( Figure 5C ). No obvious temperature changes were observed between these groups. Immunohistochemistry of PEDV confirmed the presence of the virus in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells on atrophic villi in some segments of the small intestine ( Figure 6A-E) . PEDV antigen was detected in some cells of ileum, jejunum, duodenum, and cecum of piglets infected by SDSX16-P10, P30, P64, P65 or P75. SDSX16-P10 and -P30 caused severe villous atrophy in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes in most jejunum and ileum. P64 and P65 caused moderate villous atrophy in some jejunum and ileum. P75 caused mild villous atrophy in a few jejunum or ileum. PEDV IHC antigen was not detected in the intestines of mock piglets ( Figure 6F ). The piglets infected with SDSX16-10 developed severe acute enteritis typical of PEDV throughout the study, demonstrating that the isolate was virulent and enteropathogenic in neonatal piglets. The piglets were infected by the higher passage of SDSX16, which had slighter diarrhea, vomiting and fecal shedding. The results indicated that the mutations in the S gene, caused by the serial passages of SDSX16, might be related to the attenuation of virulence in vivo. ",

We evaluated the changes in gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1\u03b2, IL6, and TNF-\u03b1) and type I interferon (IFN-\u03b2) in porcine intestinal epithelial cells infected with different SDSX16 strains. The mRNA levels of IL1\u03b2, IL6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in porcine intestinal epithelial cells infected with SDSX16-P10 strain were much lower than SDSX16-P75 at 18 h post-infection (hpi). However, there was no significant difference in the examination of cytokine expression between porcine intestinal epithelial cells infected by P63 and P64 respectively (Figure 7 ). Next, we used flow cytometry to detect IL6 and TNF-\u03b1 protein levels in cells infected with SDSX16-P10 or -P75. The results showed that SDSX16-P10 strain-stimulated IL6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression of the protein was markedly lower than SDSX16-P75 at 18 hpi ( Figure 8 ). Collectively, these data suggest that there was no significant difference in cytokines expression between cells infected with SDSX16-P63 and -P64, and SDSX16-P10 had a stronger ability to inhibit cytokines expression than SDSX16-P75.

At present, piglet diarrhea, caused by PEDV infection, leads to huge losses in many pig farms [38] . We collected clinical samples from pig breeding farms in Shandong Province where severe acute diarrhea was associated with high mortality in suckling piglets. Isolation of variant strains is important for effective control of piglet PEDV infection and vaccine development. In this study, we successfully isolated a strain of PEDV from the intestinal tissues of a PED-infected piglet. The PEDV SDSX16 isolate showed obvious CPE (syncytium formation) in Vero cells from after passage 5, the viral titers started from roughly 10 4.15 TCID 50 /mL and increased after serial passages to 10 7.6 TCID 50 /mL. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene sequences showed the SDSX16 isolate belonged to subgroup II. More recently, it has been reported that PEDV G2 strain-based inactivated vaccine candidates are candidates for developing an effective vaccine against the virulent pandemic PEDV strains [39] . These results suggest the SDSX16 strain could be a candidate strain for vaccine development against PEDV variant strains.",

Considering that S protein plays a crucial role in mediating virus-cell fusion and inducing neutralizing antibodies, we focus on analyzing to vary the S gene during the successive passage. The result found the S gene had greater diversity, while other genes (ORF1a/b, M, N, E, and ORF3) occurred acid point mutants. We further determined the serial passage of SDX16 in Vero cells resulted in the viral growth adaptation and promoting its replication in vitro by growth kinetics and virus titration assay. The serial passage of PEDV and other coronaviruses often results in the attenuation of virus virulence [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . To study whether the serial passages of SDSX16 have influenced the viral pathogenicity, PEDV-seronegative, three-day-old pigs were inoculated orally with SDSX16 different viruses. The results suggested that successive passage resulted in attenuation of the SDSX16 strain, and deleting six amino acids in the S gene might affect the pathogenicity of the virus. Although data indicating pivotal roles of S protein in determining phenotypes of coronaviruses have been accumulated, it remains to be determined whether the mutations in the S gene of SDSX16 contribute to the viral attenuation and virus virulence. Therefore, we will need to apply PEDV reverse genetics systems to further studies to define the genetic mechanisms that underlie the attenuation of PEDV.",

TNF-\u03b1 has an antiviral function, and IL6 is associated with improving humoral and mucosal immune response [21, 46] . Variant PEDV (genogroup G2) exhibits higher resistance to the interferon than the existing PEDV and avoids the neutralizing antibody against PEDV [47] [48] [49] . In order to understand whether there were differences in the cytokine levels between the SDSX16-P10 and -P75 strain. We compared SDSX16-P10 with -P75 and found that IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels could be up-regulated in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. However, the mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in cells induced by SDSX16-P75, were much higher than SDSX16-P10. Additionally, it has been reported that highly pathogenic PEDV strain suppressed the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production through the down-regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [25, 26, [50] [51] [52] . SDSX16-P75 induces higher levels of cytokine production indicating that the pathogenicity of the SDSX16 strain is weakened by the successive passage in vitro, which is consistent with the results of animal experiments. Our study demonstrated that the ability of PEDV to induce type I IFNs is strain-specific. Thus, Type I IFNs may play an important role in PEDV replication and pathogenesis.",
