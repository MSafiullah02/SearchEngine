The efficient physical barrier formed by these cells is complemented by the mucociliary escalator, which also contributes significantly to defense of the airways against potentially harmful inhaled physical, chemical and biological agents [2]. After infecting the airway epithelium, human rhinovirus and influenza A virus trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses that are crucial for efficient antiviral control [[3], [4], [5]]. Airway epithelial cells also have an important role in the local regulation of the inflammatory response to viruses by releasing a variety of pleiotropic cytokines and chemokines. The cytokines (such as IL-1 and IL-6) exert a number of actions in the airways, whereas the chemokines (such as CCL5, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL8, and CXCL10) contribute to the recruitment and activation of selected inflammatory cell populations (including neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, lymphocytes and natural killer cells) [6,7].",

Fucoidans constitute the main class of polysaccharide found in brown algae. They contain high levels of l-fucose and sulfate ester groups, and exert a variety of antiviral [15,16], anti-inflammatory [17] and immunomodulatory effects [18,19]. In particular, fucoidans are known to be ligands for class A scavenger receptors (SR-A), which also belong to the pattern recognition receptor family. It is known that SR-A is a cell surface receptor for dsRNA, and so may also be involved in antiviral immune responses [20]. To the best of our knowledge, the fucoidans' effects on the release of inflammatory mediators induced by TLR3 activation have not previously been characterized. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of a marine-sourced fucoidan solution (MFS) from Ascophyllum nodosum on the mRNA expression and protein production of cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by human primary bronchial epithelial cells following TLR3 activation by Poly(I:C) (a synthetic analog of dsRNA) [21,22].",

Lung tissue samples were obtained from 17 patients (10 males and 7 females; 6 smokers, 10 former smokers, 1 non-smoker; mean \u00b1 standard error (SD) age: 65.5 \u00b1 7.2 years; FEV1: 74.4 \u00b1 23.7%; pack-years: 36 \u00b1 13; 7 had COPD) undergoing surgical resection for lung carcinoma and who had not received prior chemotherapy. None of the subjects had been treated with immunosuppressants or corticosteroids before surgery. Proximal segmental bronchi collected from sites distant from the tumor were placed in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, HEPES, antibiotics, and antifungal drugs (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, vancomycin, amphotericin, ceftazidim and MycoZap\u2122), and were stored at +4 \u00b0C (for bacterial decontamination) for at least 3 days. The bronchial mucus was removed, and the bronchus was cut lengthwise before the addition of protease (10 mg\u00b7mL\u22121) overnight at +4 \u00b0C. On the following day, the luminal surface of each bronchus sample was gently scratched in order to detach epithelial cells into the culture medium. After centrifugation of the cell suspension, the cell pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of supplemented high-glucose DMEM and placed in a culture flask for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The supernatant was recovered and placed in a BioCoat collagen-coated flask. On the following day and then every other day, the culture medium was replaced with 15 mL of antibiotic-free high-glucose DMEM and 15 mL of BEGM (referred to hereafter as BEGM-DMEM). When the cells reached confluence (usually after 7 days of culture), they were detached from the plate with trypsin, centrifuged, and resuspended in BEGM-DMEM in a 24-well plate (1 mL per well) for 24 h prior to exposure to pharmacological agents.",

Over the last few decades, fucoidans purified from different species of brown alga have been extensively studied because of their broad spectrum of desirable biological activities, including anticoagulant, antithrombotic, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects [30]. In a recent in vitro study of RAW 264.7 macrophages, fucoidans purified from the marine brown alga Chnoospora minima were found to inhibit (i) the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of nitrous oxide and PGE2 via the downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and COX-2 expression, and (ii) the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2, and IL-6 [31]. Furthermore, sulfated polysaccharides extracted from other brown seaweeds (Sargassum hemiphyllum and Sargassum horneri) were shown to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1), NO production, and the expression of IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, and COX-2 and NF-\u03baB (p65) in LPS-stimulated RAW 246.7 macrophages [32,33]. In macrophages, the mechanisms underlying the fucoidans' anti-inflammatory actions have yet to be elucidated. However, it has been reported that fucoidans regulated signaling pathways involving MAP kinases and NF-\u03baB [34]. Since the MFS did not influence epithelial cell viability, its inhibitory effect was not due to non-specific toxicity.",

Indeed, activation of the SR-A-fucoidan complex is dependent on endocytosis [42], and endosomal internalization of cell-surface TLR3 is critical for the epithelial cells' response to Poly(I:C) [14]. In the present study, the SR-A-fucoidan complex may have been endocytosed (along with TLR3) during the one-hour exposure to MFS, and thus would no longer have been present on the cell surface when Poly(I:C) was added - thus blocking the response to this TLR agonist.

            "text": "The airway epithelium is continuously exposed to a multitude of noxious challenges in inhaled air, and has an important role in regulating the local inflammatory response to viral infections of the upper and lower airways. Earlier research has shown that human bronchial epithelial cell cultures accurately recapitulate the functional characteristics of human nasal epithelial cells, and so could therefore serve as a surrogate for the latter. Indeed, the two cell types have morphologic, histologic and functional similarities. Their respective ciliary activities react to various agonists and antagonists in a similar manner [43]. In experiments on nasal and bronchial epithelial cells harvested from children with cystic fibrosis (with a wide variety of CFTR mutations), the cell types' stimulated and inhibited levels of CFTR were similar [44]. In other studies of human bronchial and nasal epithelial cells, levels of cytokine and chemokine release in vitro were similar for both non-stimulated cells and cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-13 or even rhinovirus infection [[45], [46], [47]]. Indeed, nasal epithelial cells showed much the same cytokine responses as bronchial epithelial cells when exposed to rhinovirus under air-liquid interface culture or submerged culture conditions; this observation is of particularly relevance to the present study [47]. Taken as a whole, these findings strongly suggest that (i) nasal and bronchial airway epithelial cells can be used interchangeably, and thus (ii) our observation of MFS's anti-inflammatory effects on bronchial epithelial cells can be legitimately transposed to nasal epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Most common colds are caused by respiratory viruses whose number, diversity and antigenic variability limit the development of an effective vaccine. Although the infection is usually self-limiting, it affects people of all age groups and still causes significant morbidity. At present, the standard therapy for the common cold is general care and the treatment of symptoms. Over-the-counter antihistamines are commonly used to relieve symptoms but have a short-term beneficial effect and do not appear to be effective in children [48]. Over-the-counter nasal decongestants are also used, although their effectiveness and safety in children and the clinical relevance of their small symptomatic effect in adults have yet to be demonstrated [49]. Furthermore, the available evidence does not support the use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold [50]. It was recently shown that iota-carrageenan (a sulfated polysaccharide found in some species of red seaweed) exerts potent activity against respiratory viruses by directly binding to the infectious particles; however, carrageenan does not enter the host cell and is not expected to exert pharmacologic or immune activities [51]. Although iota-carrageenan was found to be effective as nasal spray in three clinical trials [1,51,52], it failed to achieve statistically significant outcomes for the primary and secondary endpoints in the most recent study [53]. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for acute upper respiratory tract infections - particularly in children - and might relieve the symptoms to some extent [54]. The MFS assessed here is a ready-to-use, topically applied solution that combines nasal saline irrigation and the topical delivery of fucoidans.",
