            "text": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) invented by Kary Mullis and honoured with the noble prize is still the most relevant nucleic acid amplification technolo gy (NAT) and has comprehensively revolutionized di\u00adagnostics in many areas [1]. Compared to alternative NATs, for example transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), PCR could easier be established in-house in many laboratories worldwide with little effort and reasonable costs. With the invention of the real-time PCR, this technology became amenable to automation and it significantly reduced its inherent drawbacks [2]. Contamination of equipment and laboratories with amplification products (amplicons) could be minimized or even eliminated. Internal controls could easily be included and discriminated from the target sequences by labelling with different fluorophores. By multiplexing of PCRs several different viruses could be detected in parallel with one test and discriminated from each other by different labels. This readily available technology fuelled many applications requiring the highest sensitivity and specificity in conjunction with the highest throughput and reasonable cost. These technical advances paved the way during the past 2 decades to an unprecedented high level of blood safety.",

In the mid-1990s, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) pushed HCV NAT for manufacturing plasma pool testing in order to identify virus-contaminated batches of source material for the manufacture of blood products which were distributed worldwide. \u201cFrom the 1st of July 1999 only batches derived from plasma pools tested and found non-reactive for HCV RNA by NAT \u2026 should be batch released by marketing authorisation holder\u201d [19].

Pretesting of mini pools was encouraged in order to prevent the contamination of production pools with thousands of litres of plasma [19].",

Blood establishments selling plasma for fractionation had to provide separate plasma samples for pooling and testing. This complicated logistics and increased costs for both sides. To reduce expenditure, manufacturers offered higher rates for plasma pretested by NAT. Blood centres selling plasma for fractionation were therefore interested in establishing their own in-house NAT pretesting of mini pools which could also be adopted for labile components. In contrast to fractionation plasma, platelets have a shelf life of days and results should be available before pooled platelets are manufactured. Thus, the time to result had to be condensed to less than 1 working day. Consequently, the pool size had to be reduced and pool resolution accelerated. Smaller pools of up 96 samples caused increased throughput, workload, and costs, but reduced the number of donations on hold if a pool tested positive. This improved the blood supply and simplified platelet production. More importantly, the reduction of the pool size increased sensitivity and product safety.",

Some countries have already introduced HEV NAT screening of blood donations, including the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands [44], and recently Switzerland. In Germany, the PEI intends to mandate HEV NAT screening in October 2019 according to a phased plan [42]. This underlines the importance of NAT testing, which is the only countermeasure to reduce the transmission risk [43, 44].",

In particular, our knowledge on how viruses replicate and on the respective diagnostic window has expanded. Analysing seroconversion panels obtained from frequent source plasma donors by quantitative and qualitative NAT revealed a very long pre-seroconversion window of 59 days on average, and a high replication rate of HCV with a doubling time of 10.8 h [46, 47]. Similar studies were performed with panels from HBV and HIV-1 infected donors revealing doubling times of 3.9 and 0.9 days, respectively [48]. These data allow estimating by back calculation the reduction of the pre-seroconversion window by NAT assays and the residual window of the NAT test itself dependent on the sensitivity of the respective test. Blood donation NAT has also triggered studies on the minimal infectious dose of the different viruses which has a direct impact on blood safety through the required LOD of NAT tests to reach zero risk. The infectious dose for HIV-1 was calculated by reverse probit analysis of the viral load of transmitting and non-transmitting donations, resulting in a 50% minimal infectious dose of about 400 virions [49]. However, considerably lower concentrations were found to be infectious [34, 50].",

The AIDS and HCV epidemic triggered worldwide measures to increase blood safety and made concerns about the cost-benefit ratio secondary. Plasma fractionators were the first to introduce NAT testing of their production pools to make, in conjunction with pathogen inactivation, blood products as safe as possible. To achieve a similar safety standard, blood donation centres adopted the technology for the testing of labile components. Since no commercial assays were available they invested high amounts of money and established in-house NAT tests for screening of their donations. It took years until the industry developed commercial test kits that were suitable for blood screening and that covered a sufficiently broad range of transfusion-relevant viruses. Increasing automation and significant price reductions made the technology amenable to an increasing number of countries. The yield of serologically negative NAT-only positive donations was convincing and facilitated its acceptance. Virus transmission risk could be reduced to almost zero. Upon the introduction of universal pathogen reduction in conjunction with NAT testing, the ultimate goal of zero risk could be achieved and serological testing would be dispensable.",
