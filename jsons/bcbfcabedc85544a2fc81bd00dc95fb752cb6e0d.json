Methods: We performed surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on 89 sera collected from 28 SARS patients, 72 sera from 51 control patients with various viral or bacterial infections, and 10 sera from apparently healthy individuals. Results: Nine significantly increased and three significantly decreased serum biomarkers were discovered in the SARS patients compared with the controls. Among these biomarkers, one (11 695 Da) was identified to be serum amyloid A (SAA) protein by peptide mapping and tandem mass spectrometric analysis. When we monitored the SAA concentrations longitudinally in 45 sera from four SARS patients, we found a good correlation of SAA concentration with the extent of pneumonia as assessed by a serial chest x-ray opacity score. Increased SAA occurred in three of four patients at the time of extensive pneumonia as indicated by high x-ray scores. Over the course of gradual recovery in two patients, as assessed clinically and radiologically, SAA concentrations gradually decreased. In the third patient, the concentrations were initially increased, but were further increased with superimposed multiple bacterial infections.

Most SARS patients develop pulmonary infiltrates within 48 h of onset of disease (19 ) , usually in the form of focal and unilateral consolidation in the peripheral regions of the lung (20 ) . The consolidation usually clears quickly, but a small proportion of patients progress to bilateral consolidation with extensive pneumonic involvement and protracted clinical course (7 ) . Serial chest radiographs are helpful in the diagnosis and monitoring of the clinical course (6, 7 ) , but their interpretation can be confounded by a lack of available experienced radiologists, by interobserver variability, and by the frequently suboptimal quality of portable films taken in isolation wards to avoid the spread of infections to other patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 131, "text": "(18 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "3 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 357, "end": 362, "text": "(19 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 461, "end": 466, "text": "(20 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 650, "end": 654, "text": "(7 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 749, "end": 756, "text": "(6, 7 )", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "SARS-CoV antibody is usually increased at a later stage of disease (21 ) and is therefore not a good marker for monitoring the extent of disease.

Using this profiling technology, we found at least 12 serum biomarkers that were differentially increased or decreased in SARS patients. Among them, an acute-phase protein, SAA, was substantially increased in 44 sera from 24 SARS patients, in contrast to 72 sera from 51 control patients with different viral or bacterial infec- tions. Using a clinically useful chest radiographic score, we found that the SAA concentration correlated well with the extent of pneumonia in four patients for whom serial serum samples were available. In the first two patients, this protein was increased, similar to the increase in radiographic score in the active phase of the disease within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset. The slightly earlier peaks in SAA concentrations compared with the radiographic scores could perhaps indicate that SAA might be an earlier marker in disease activity, although this requires further validation.

Hence, it is not surprising that the fourth patient demonstrated an increase in SAA concentration in the near-terminal part of her illness when there were superimposed bacterial infections, followed by a slight decrease after antibiotics were initiated. This increase was probably additional to the persistent SARS-CoV infection, as demonstrated by the persistently positive RT-PCR results for samples from various sources and her continuous severe radiologic abnormalities. Such an increase in SAA was, however, in contrast to the low concentrations of this protein in the tested control viral and bacterial infections (Figs. 2 and 3) and probably was a result of the severity of multiple superimposed infections and septicemia in this patient.

Knowing that IL-1 and IL-6 can rapidly induce 1000-fold increases in SAA in a synergistic manner (42 ) , it thus perhaps explains the possible rapid induction of this acute-phase reactant at the time of SARS CoV infection.
