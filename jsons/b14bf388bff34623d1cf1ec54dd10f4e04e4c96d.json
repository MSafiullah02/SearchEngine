            "text": "The human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) pandemic (pandemic) was a major crisis at the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century. Such a defining moment in the history of healthrelated infections led to transformations in its proponents, as well as their medical practice. This research article aims to offer insights into the lived trajectories/experiences (journeys) of six Canadian gay physicians while they attempted to treat, care for, and cure/heal (treat) gay HIV/AIDS patients from 1981 to 2009. According to Valdiserri (2011) , in June 1981, a major event, referred to as a tempest, crisis, lethal threat, or new outbreak (among other terms), shocked the world and baffled the medical establishment (Bayer & Oppenheimer, 2000; Finkelstein, 2018 ; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS, 2002; L\u00e9vy & Qu\u00e9villon, 2014 -2015 Piot & Quinn, 2013; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018 ). An unknown virus, disease, or infection was reported for the first time by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (U.S Department of Health and Human Services, 2018) . It was first called gay cancer or gay plague by the media, and gay-related immune deficiency (GRID) by the CDC (Altman, 1982; Chibbaro, 1982; Cichocki, 2009; Kher, 1982) . In 1982, the CDC renamed the infection AIDS. 1 It was not until 1986 that HIV was termed (Aldrich & Wotherspoon, 2001) . The infection soon grew into an epidemic, as it was prevalent within a larger community, mostly gay (Bayer & Oppenheimer, 2000; Ungvarski, 2001) . As cases appeared in other parts of the world, besides North America, such as Europe and Africa, it was eventually recognized as a pandemic (Altman, 2011; Smith, 2001) .",

They speak of \"courage, cowardice, hope, despair, compassion, and bigotry\" (Ungvarski, 2001, p. 26) . They describe the fear of the unknown, the spread of the disease, death, sexuality, and alternative lifestyles, such as bisexuality, homosexuality, transgender, and drug use (Witt Sherman, 2000; Witt Sherman & Ouellette, 2000) . Because of the attitudes, beliefs, interpretations, opinions, perceptions, and values that individuals held about HIV/AIDS, many social problems arose, such as stigmatization, discrimination, and prejudice (De Oliveira Almeida, Vandenplas-Holper, & De Ketele, 1992; Witt Sherman, 2000; Witt Sherman & Ouellette, 2000) . Moreover, because of the convergence of the myriad of uncertainties regarding HIV prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, and opportunistic infections, many HIV-infected patients developed comorbidities with the above-mentioned issues or fears. Furthermore, some health professionals \"succumb[ed] to hysteria and abandon [ed] their objectivity and compassion in the care of patients with HIV/AIDS\" (Dunkel & Harfield, 1986, p. 114; Witt Sherman, 2000; Witt Sherman & Ouellette, 2000) .",

Many gay health professionals, and gay physicians in particular, embraced the same view. They responded to the call to action because they had friends or family members who were HIV-infected, or as a personal response to the abandonment and rejection of their patients who were either gay, or HIV-infected, or both simultaneously (Pascreta & Jacobsen, 1989) . By heeding the call to action, these physicians modified their public image and, at the same time, transformed their personal identity. They came out of their professional sexual neutrality and became \"openly\" gay physicians, profoundly implicated in the political, social, and medical causes of their patients, friends, and community (Jacob, 2012) .",

However, those who survived this period appear to be ready to speak about it again. There is a new generation of activists, archivists, artists, historians, and researchers, among others, who were born during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, who now need to make sense of this grim period (Finkelstein, 2018) . Moreover, there is a growing number of archival projects, books, documentaries, and gallery exhibitions that are now devoted to the topic, with more underway.",

They mainly sought out physicians who could and were willing to provide information by virtue of their expertise and competence in sexually and blood-transmitted infections and in the HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment field. They looked for those who were involved and had experience, since the beginning of the pandemic, in the treatment of patients, and who had the reputation of having been confronted by the devastating effects of the pandemic throughout its trajectory by the HIV/AIDS research community. Moreover, they sought out physicians with the same sexual preference as theirs and identified as being gay, as well as individuals who possessed a militancy background, that is to say, mobilized and advocated for their patients and their community. Finally, patients migrated toward locations where these specific physicians had established their practice in large Canadian urban centers, mainly in private and public health clinics specialized in the treatment of patients with sexually and blood-transmitted infections, and in the HIV/ AIDS prevention and treatment field.",

Six physicians responded to the invitation, thus forming the six cases. Their median age was 48 years old and their experience in the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients spanned an average of 19 years, with their medical practice consisting of 200 HIV/AIDS patients, in mean terms. Finally, the six physicians practiced medicine in large Canadian urban centers: four in private health clinics and two in public health clinics specialized in the prevention, treatment, and care of patients with sexually and blood-transmitted infections (e.g., HIV).",

After the standard procedures for qualitative studies, that is, explanation of the study, interview procedure, and consent form, the second phase of study began, that is, data collection through interviews. Interviews were conducted either at the physician's workplace (e.g., office) or in a room on the university campus. They were to last roughly 1 hr. However, the physicians' generosity would not be dampened by a time constraint! The interviews were conducted using an interview grid, that is, closed-ended questions for quantitative information gathering (e.g., age, number of years of experience, number of HIV/AIDS patients, and work environment) and open-ended questions for qualitative information gathering about the physicians' lived journeys. Besides being audio-taped, a researcher journal was maintained to capture the researcher's impressions and perceptions following each interview. The study used the period that included the start of the epidemic (around 1981) through to the said infection chronicity (around 1998), as well as up to the interview period, 2008-2009. Data were produced using the complete audio-taped transcription of each interview assisted by \"word processing software.\" To allow for a preliminary analysis, the complete transcription of the audio tape for each interview was performed within 24 hr following the interview.",

As there was no mention of God or spirituality-like in Jacob's study-in either \"causing the epidemic, or alleviating the suffering\" (p. 284), physicians seem to have chosen this path of life based on \"conscious choices,\" and to be dedicated to their field for \"humanistic values\" (p. 284). However, such a life choice and dedication did not prevent them from burning out, experiencing depression, or marital conflicts.

There was discrimination, stigmatization, and prejudice toward AIDS victims but, as Waddell points out, there were also poignant reunions with past lovers and friends because of the disease.

They modified their relationship to their networks, namely, community organizations, other colleagues, pharmacists, and the pharmaceutical industry, by increasing their personal and professional involvement in gay community organizations against HIV/AIDS, building a network of professionals able and willing to care for their patients, and becoming physician researchers practitioners.",
