An absence of CPE in the Vero E6 cells indicated a loss of infectivity and was evidence of inactivation of the SARS-CoV samples. As the first dilution of viral sample inoculated onto the Vero cells was a 1-in-10 dilution, the limit of viral detection for this assay was 1 log TCID 50 per mL.

Although the virus in 10 percent BSA appeared to be inactivated in 15 minutes, there was a small, yet detectable amount of virus present in one of the triplicate 25-minute samples (Fig. 1B) . This outlier may have arisen due to experimental error or the virus may have aggregated thus making it more resistant to inactivation. By 30 minutes, SARS-CoV was inactivated in the 10 percent BSA solution and was no longer detectable for the duration of the experiment (120 min). Fifteen minutes at 60\u00b0C significantly decreased, to near the limit of detection of the assay, the titer of SARS-CoV in the 25 percent BSA protein solution (Fig. 1B) . Unfortunately, at 20 minutes, the 25 percent BSA solutions were denatured and rendered them inappropriate for virus titer testing.

UVC and UVB light causes pyrimidine dimers, 10 whereas UVA may cause RNA and DNA strand breaks. 11 The effect of UV irradiation on SARS-CoV infectivity was examined by spiking solutions of BSA or DMEM with SARS-CoV in 24-well tissue culture plates on ice. The samples were exposed to UV light for varying lengths of time and tested for infectivity. As expected from our previous results, 6 UVC treatment significantly decreased the virus titer after 20 minutes and inactivated SARS-CoV in PBS to the limit of detection by 40 minutes (Fig. 2A) . UVC treatment, however, did not inactivate the virus in BSA protein solutions, and the virus was still infectious even after 60 minutes of treatment ( Fig. 2A) . Additionally, lower concentrations of protein resulted in some inactivation after exposure to UVC. We determined that some inactivation of SARS-CoV occurred in 2 and 5 percent BSA protein solutions but to a lesser extent than when no protein was present (data not shown). This suggests that there is a concentration-dependent protective effect of BSA not present in PBS alone. UVA treatment to inactivate viruses in platelet (PLT) concentrates is combined with psoralen compounds to increase the effectiveness of the method. 12 We determined that UVA treatment of SARS-CoV in DMEM decreased the infectivity by 100-fold after 30 minutes, whereas the addition of psoralen inactivated the virus to the limit of detection after only 15 minutes (Fig. 2B) . Although UVA treatment of SARS-CoV in 10 percent BSA resulted in no inactivation after 30 minutes, the addition of psoralen brought about a 100-fold decrease in infectivity during the same amount of time, yet did not result in complete inactivation of the virus (Fig. 2B) . These data suggest that the addition of psoralen increases the effectiveness of UVA treatment regardless of the presence of BSA protein, and the presence of BSA protein limits the effectiveness of UVA inactivation of SARS-CoV.",

Octanoic acid had no apparent effect on the infectivity of SARS-CoV (Fig. 3A) .

With an immunofluorescent antibody assay, Hsueh and associates 18 have detected immunoglobulin (Ig)G seroconversion by Day 10 and IgM and IgA seroconversion on Day 11. Wang and coworkers 19 determined that SARS-CoV RNA was detectable by quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay as early as 2 days after onset of SARS symptoms in 50 percent of the patient plasma samples they examined. In 75 percent of SARS patients they found peak C viral RNA titers detected at 5 to 7 days after symptom onset. These data do not exclude the possibility that (in the event of an outbreak) SARS may be present in the blood of asymptomatic but infected individuals at undetectable levels. Owing to the possibility for SARS-CoV transmission via plasma-derived components, current viral inactivation methods need to be evaluated for effectiveness against SARS-CoV. Pasteurization at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours is used to inactivate potential viruses in plasma-derived products. 20 An advantage of this technique is that it is effective against both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. 20 Stabilizers to protect the protein product, however, may also protect or mask the virus. Neoantigens may be formed from partial denaturation of human serum components that may appear foreign to the immune system. 20 This could be deleterious, because it may result in the onset of autoimmune disease. We determined that SARS-CoV was inactivated by pasteurization at 60\u00b0C in less than 1 hour; however, protein concentration affected the time required for inactivation. Previously we examined the ability of heat to inactivate SARS-CoV when in DMEM instead of human serum or BSA solutions. We found that 90 minutes at either 56 or 65\u00b0C was necessary to inactivate the virus. 6 Yunoki and associates 21 examined the sensitivity of SARS-CoV to 60\u00b0C heat and found that the different protein compositions of the samples tested affected the time necessary, yet all samples were inactivated to the limit of detection by 1 hour. Additionally, Rabenau and coworkers 22 tested heat inactivation of SARS-CoV at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and determined that the presence of 20 percent fetal calf serum protected the virus. We observed that incubation at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes, however, was sufficient for complete inactivation to the limit of detection. Given that pasteurization of plasma-derived products is usually performed at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours, 20 any SARS-CoV present in such products, regardless of protein concentrations and in the presence of stabilizers, should be efficiently inactivated.",

We determined that SARS-CoV was resistant to inactivation by octanoic acid treatment, even under the conditions of acidic pH (4.5), elevated temperature (30\u00b0C), a higher concentration (40 mmol/L) of octanoate, and a longer treatment time (24 hr). Based on the work of Lundblad and Seng, 25 we exposed both RSV and HSV-1 to octanoate as a control. Octanoic acid treatment decreased the titer of RSV, suggesting that our conditions were correct for inactivation. In contrast, Lundblad and Seng 25 effectively inactivated HSV-1 with octanoic acid at similar conditions, but the octanoic acid was removed with an ion-exchange column, and this may account for differences in the end result.

            "text": "S/D methods are not used for inactivation of viruses in cellular blood components because S/D treatment damages cell membranes. 27 The S/D method causes a disruption of the structural integrity of lipid-enveloped viruses. 20 The S/D treatment has the advantage of being highly efficient at inactivating enveloped viruses, while being nondenaturing on proteins, and yielding a high recovery of protein activity. 20 The disadvantages include requiring an extra manufacturing step to remove the S/D agents and the inability to inactivate nonenveloped viruses. 20 In our experiments, both Triton X-100 and Tween 80 inactivated SARS-CoV in BSA solutions. Sodium cholate was ineffective in high protein concentrations even after 24 hours of treatment. There may be a protective effect by some of the proteins in the BSA solutions, as the SARS-CoV in the higher concentrations of BSA was not inactivated as quickly by Tween 80 or sodium cholate as it was with Triton X-100. Horowitz and associates 28 have shown that the S/D method can very effectively inactivate cytomegalovirus, Sindbis virus, and other pathogenic viruses. The Tween 80 and Triton X-100 methods should be sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV in plasma for the manufacture of plasma-derived products.",
