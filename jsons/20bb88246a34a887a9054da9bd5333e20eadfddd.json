In Argentina up to date, 843 cases have been confirmed and 34 have died due to COVID-19. At this point, the challenge is how to adapt the international measures to the local epidemiologic situation, which is dynamic. The recommendations issued by the Ministry of Health are the first reference to be considered. In Argentina, under the present epidemiologic situation, patients are categorized as suspicious of COVID-19 and nonsuspicious of COVID-19 according to their symptoms and epidemiologic links. The National Ministry of Health has determined that asymptomatic persons with an epidemiologic link are banned from circulating and from receiving routine care with the exception of urgent circumstances.
