The global water crisis is clear, one only needs to quote the statistics on the billions of people without access to safe water, sanitation and the global estimates of the burden of waterborne disease. The greatest sources of biological contaminants associated with this disease burden in water remains human and animal feces. There is a critical need to develop a science-based program to address both water quantity and quality of water, water uses and discharges. Recommendations to achieve better access to scientific information for decision making include: 1) develop watershed approaches for determining the source and the behaviour of water-borne biological contaminants which can be used within Water Safety Plans, 2) utilize new tools and technologies for measuring the hazards and the exposure goals for biological contaminant loading for achieving safe water.",

Displacement of people, disruption of services with the destruction or lack of infrastructure, inadequate water treatment, flooding (storms) and thus widespread fecal contamination, all resulting in the fear of massive waterborne disease particularly impacting those individuals who are most susceptible, the children and those with weakened systems due to stress, poor nutrition, (other diseases such as AIDS) and lack of medical care. The assurance of safe water and adequate control of fecal contamination of water continues to be a common struggle for millions and these same issues which have been extolled for the tsunami victims are those that the global health and water science and technology community must address to meet the Millennium Development Goals for water and sanitation (UN, 2000; . Yet unfortunately, water quality problems and massive fecal contamination remain invisible, with little water quality data available for those who need to know and make decisions and thus it takes a massive and dramatic crisis, before even minimal attention is given to those dealing with these challenges on a daily basis. The World Health Organization has estimated that 40% of the world's people lack sanitation (2.4 billion people) and 1.1 billion people lack access to safe water (WHO, 2000) . Up to 2.2 million children will die from diarrhea annually. Significant issues will need to be addressed regarding the biological agents found in water and the infectious diseases associated with these agents in order to make progress without slipping further and further behind in achieving the MDG. Fecal contamination and the loading of pathogens to water need to be determined and then strategies and goals for reducing this burden can be implemented. New tools can be used to build a global water quality data base on fecal contamination of waters, identifying biological agents in a risk-based scientific framework and thus will enhance the implementation of Water Safety Plans providing a true basis for measuring and achieving safe water (WHO, 2004).",

            "text": "Viruses, due to their small size and structure, their environmental stability and low infectivity, remain biological contaminants which elicit a high probability of infection via ingestion of contaminated water (Haas et al., 1999) . Viruses cause a wide-range of significant diseases many which may have chronic outcomes including polyomelitis, meningitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis. Viral agents have been implicated in endemic diarrheal disease due to contaminated groundwater in rural areas in Wisconsin likely associated with septic tanks. Children were shown to be at particularly high risk of illness (Borchardt et al. 2003) . The coliform indicator bacteria did not prove to be a sufficient measure of risk. Therefore viral contamination of groundwater needs to be particularly assessed as children are very susceptible to severe disease; bacterial indicators are not indicative of viruses and groundwater is often used without disinfection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enteric RNA virus isolated from humans and causes jaundice and clinical signs similar to hepatitis A virus. HEV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and has caused devastating waterborne disease outbreaks particularly in tropical and subtropical countries with inadequate sanitation (Aggarwal and Naik 1997; Balayan 1997) . In Kanpur, India in 1991, there were 79,000 cases of HEV due to sewage contamination of the drinking water. The earliest confirmed outbreaks occurred in the 1950s in India (Bradley 1992) . Children are often asymptomatic and the mortality rate is between 0.1 and 4% (Grabow et al. 1994) . In pregnant women in their third trimester, the mortality rate can exceed 20% (Hurst et al. 1996) . There has been speculation that HEV is endemic in various parts of the world and subclinical cases may be contributing to the spread of the disease. HEV is also found in wild and domestic animals. Studies using genetic sequencing have found that human and pig HEV are genetically similar and belong to the same genotype and swine HEV is widespread in U.S. swine herds (Huang et al. 2002; Smith 2001) . Thus zoonotic transmission seems quite likely and at least one strain can infect across species barriers (Smith 2001) . Recent studies in the U.S. have shown that swine veterinarians are at in increased potential risk of zoonotic HEV infections . The fecal contamination of water from pigs continues to challenge the human population with potential risks associated with the transmission of these agents. The survival and resistance of HEV to water treatment has not been well studied but is presumed to be very similar to Hepatitis A Virus. As enteric viruses, they are stable in the water environment particularly at lower temperatures. In addition, during water disinfection, the viruses are more resistant to chlorination than bacteria although good inactivation can be achieved with free chlorine. Chlorine disinfection does not inactivate viruses in wastewater as effectively as it does in drinking water because of interference by dissolved organics and suspended particulates; the resulting disinfectant is combined chlorine, which inactivates viruses less effectively than free chlorine does (Mahin and Pancorbo, 1999) .",

Several studies have suggested that adenoviruses outnumbered other enteric viruses in sewage-contaminated waters and may survive longer than other viruses in water (Enriquez et al. 1995; Pina et al. 1998) . Adenovirus 40 and 41 are enteric based and are the second most important etiologic agents of childhood gastroenteritis after rotavirus. The number of waterborne outbreaks caused by adenoviruses might have been underestimated because they are not being routinely screened for in outbreak samples. These viruses are commonly detected in coastal systems likely influencing recreational risks and indicative of the sewage discharges to the coast (Griffin et al., 2003) and both respiratory and enteric adenoviruses have been detected in treated drinking water when disinfectant contact times and concentrations were too low for virus inactivation (Lee and Kim, 2002) .",

Noroviruses are extremely stable in the environment, they are stable in less than 10 parts per million (ppm) chlorine and can withstand freezing and heating to 60 \u00b0C (Nwachcuku and Gerba 2004) . Substantial strain diversity leads to short-lived host immunity to infection permit re-infection and make the development of a vaccine that offers lifelong protection impossible (Glass et al. 2001) . The estimated total number of cases of norovirus infection per year is 23,000,000 in the United States alone (Mead 1999 ). There has been a world-wide occurrence of norovirus outbreaks in the last few years, causing problems with cruise ships, hotels, drinking water, recreational water and in nursing homes where mortality has been reported. Just in the US. the number of drinking waterrelated norovirus outbreaks has increased from three during 1999-2000 to five during 2001 (Prevention 2004 . Norovirus outbreaks constituted for 9% of waterborne-disease outbreaks of gastroenteritis associated with recreational water during 1993-2002 and 16.7% waterborne-disease outbreaks of gastroenteritis associated with recreational water during 2001-2002. There are disturbing new reports regarding the potential for waterborne transmission of the cancer-causing viruses, the polyomaviruses (Bofill-Mas et al., 2001) . The polyomaviruses include the JC and BK viruses, which cause brain, colorectal cancers and urinary tract disease. Polyoma viruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with diameter between 38 to 43 nm. JC virus, a polyoma virus, is etiologically linked to progressive mulfocal leukoencephalopathy, a fatal demyelinating disease (Nwachcuku and Gerba 2004) . Polyoma viruses can be excreted in urine of infected persons and have been detected in sewage worldwide (Bofill-Mas and Girones 2003). They have been detected at concentrations of 10 1 to 10 3 viral particles per ml in sewage in studies in the US, Europe and Africa. The viruses have been shown to be stable with T-90 (time for 90% decrease in numbers) from 26 days for JCV to 53 days for BKV at 20 o C. However, very little is known in regard to transport and exposure of these viruses as emerging waterborne agents.",

While it is acknowledged that exposure to animal fecal wastes represent a human health risk often it is human feces, septic effluent and septage, cess pool discharges, and sewage that would signal a greater risk for the presence of human pathogens, particularly human viruses. Different types of methods have been examined and they can be classified into two separate groups, library-based methods rely on the building of a watershed specific database most often for E.coli or Enterococci from fecal sources (eg. Birds, cows, humans etc) and comparing that to water isolates and includes ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, repetitive element PCR and multiple antibiotic resistance (Simpson et al. 2002) . Round robin studies have shown that library based methods have limited accuracy and lead to high false-positive rates (Griffith et al., 2003) . library-independent methods rely on the identification of host-specific markers in Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides fragilis bacteriophages, F + -specific RNA coliphage and Enterococci (Griffith et al., 2003, Scott Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are predominant in human feces and as such have the potential to be excellent indicators of human fecal pollution and a method has been recently developed that can be used with current water sampling approaches to evaluate the presence of human fecal contamination (Scott et al., 2004) . The enterococcal surface protein (esp) found in E. faecium was the target of the host-associated molecular marker used to develop the human fecal maker. Currently the method is the most robust and sensitive (60 CFU) of all the host-specific approaches and after examination of 65 wastewater and septic samples and 102 animal samples, no false positives were examined and the presence of human fecal material was detected accurately in 97% of the samples, exclusively indicates the presence of human wastes without the need to build a library.",

In this conceptual model, the environmental risk assessment process is initiated by what has been termed \"hazard assessment\" which can be thought of as identification of an agent capable of causing an adverse health effect. The actual risk that a biological agent poses results from a combination of exposure and infectivity and pathogenicity. The integrity of the risk assessment process thus depends primarily on the base of scientific information related to exposure and disease potential. Both can be exceedingly complex, and rarely is a complete understanding available on how an agent is released, how an agent is transported and transformed in the environment (and also in engineered systems), how exposure occurs, and how exposure relates to disease based at both the individual and population levels.",

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines acceptable risk of potable water to be 1:10000, i.e., 1 case of the disease in 10,000 exposed persons (Szewzyk et al. 2000) . These types of guidelines can be used to conduct mathematical modelling of the risk to public health due to the concentrations of various agents in water. However to conduct this risk assessment, key pieces of information are required to be known, or at least predictable, based on databases and applied models. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) procedures which address hazard identification, dose-response, exposure assessment and characterization have been defined (Haas et al. 1999 ), yet this system needs to incorporate both indicator data and treatment strategies.",

The United Nations World Water Assessment Programme was set up to address comprehensive water quality monitoring data bases yet, the UN Global Environment Monitoring System for Water (GEMS/Water) created in 1978, has only 104 governments participating and while there are physical and chemical water quality data there are minimal microbial data focused on fecal coliform bacterial levels with poor resolution and no ability to readily compare the data (eg. via mapping).

The WHO global Laboratory Network is centred around infectious diseases important to the country. In the US, CDC has established the Global Health Initiatives, more recently to focus on the AIDS issue. While laboratory infrastructure is being assessed, methods and supplies to address the diagnostics are moving forward, there is no reason why the testing of water can not be incorporated into these plans. The building and rebuilding of laboratory capacity is ongoing.

This approach underscores the need to enhance and refine the detection of contaminants in water, monitoring of changes in observable water quality, assessment of exposure and the potential public health impacts and improvements made with the investment in public works.",
