The chronic infl ammation of asthma is characterized by airway hyperreactivity and variable reversibility. Past classifi cation systems relied on assessment of daily impairment and the distinction between intrinsic (nonallergic) and extrinsic (allergic). With more precise asthma phenotypes, association studies likely will have greater signifi cance. In addition, patients at higher risk for severe disease can be more effectively managed, and treatments can be directed to responders. In this review, we look at eight identifi ed phenotypes: atopic and nonatopic status, pre-asthma wheezing, infl ammatory mediator predominance, aspirin-sensitive, exercise-induced, severe, and fl areprone asthma. Although signifi cant overlap exists among the distinctions, any future phenotype classifi cation system will need to incorporate these eight clinical asthmatic populations.",

The most recent summary of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel succinctly describes asthma as \"a complex disorder characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airfl ow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and an underlying infl ammation\" [1] . Yet asthma has proven to be a complex interplay of genetic predisposition and temporally specifi c environmental exposures. One recent study suggests a link between the 17q21 locus and asthma that may be most pronounced for children younger than 4 years of age with smoke exposure [2] . Our challenge is to fi nd clear distinctions within this diverse population grouped under the umbrella of asthma.",

Using cluster analysis, one study examined mildly affected patients managed by primary care and more refractory asthma patients seen in specialty clinics [7] . For the patients with milder asthma, three phenotypes were appreciated: earlyonset atopic, obese noneosinophilic, and benign. The refractory group had those initial clusters plus signifi cant early onset; symptom predominant; noneosinophilic; and late-onset, eosinophilic, minimal-symptom clusters. Comparing these clusters to a cohort that was managed by sputum-guided therapy, the authors suggest that by classifying phenotype, symptom-or sputum-based guidance can improve asthma control.",

Multiple studies have attempted to estimate the attributable risk of atopy for asthma, with a surprisingly low population-attributable risk of 33% to 56.3% [8] . Attempts to distinguish nonatopic and atopic asthma by immune response and pathology also have been equivocal [9, 10] .",

Atypical bacteria, including Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, are more prevalent in asthma patients, especially during acute fl ares, with evidence of prolonged presence (by polymerase chain reaction) up to 200 days after initial infection [24, 32] . The obligate intracellular nature of Chlamydia may contribute to its chronic low-virulence nature. Multiple studies have examined treatment of asthma patients with antibiotics, with varying results on lung function and asthma symptoms [26, 33] . In a study of severe, nonatopic adult asthma patients, Chlamydia was found in two thirds of patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and associated with a fourfold greater rate of decline in lung function [34] . Thus, a persistent, mild infection by atypical bacteria may cause a proinfl ammatory state that leads to airway remodeling and increased sensitivity to atopy. Indeed, in one murine model, mild inoculation of Chlamydia increased sensitization to allergen, whereas high doses of bacteria did not increase sensitization [35] .",

Thus, the classification of eosinophilic severe asthma is still controversial and may identify a population that can be controlled with appropriate aggressive treatment. Other common characteristics found in severe asthma patient cohorts include ASA sensitivity, gastroesophageal refl ux disease, psychological dysfunctioning, and sinopulmonary disease [22\u2022\u2022,44] . Treatment possibilities include multiple immunomodulators, with some success seen with anti-IgE and anti-IL-5 recently, although a trial of anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 did not show clinical improvement [5, 6] .",

Although severe asthma patients with diffi cult-to-control disease account for many of these visits, it is clear that asthma patients of all baseline severity can have fl ares that cause signifi cant and persistent damage [45] . Indeed, in the most recent National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines, the concept of risk is added to the traditional daily impairment classifi cation of asthma. Although a patient may have complete control between fl ares, repeated emergency department visits or hospitalizations indicate inadequate control and therefore raise the patient's severity classifi cation [1] . The importance of preventing fl ares was emphasized by a recent study that estimated a 30.2-mL greater annual decline in FEV 1 [46] . Because asthma patients of all severity levels can have frequent fl ares, attempts have been made to describe this population of \"fl are-prone\" patients. Whereas multiple studies have examined risk factors for exacerbations, only a few have attempted to characterize the population of frequent-fl aring asthma patients. Risk factors include female sex, previous fl are, recurrent infections, and allergen exposure.",

One constant risk factor for frequent fl ares is previous exacerbation, which can have an OR as high as 6.33 [47, 48] . Other risk factors for fl ares include lower baseline FEV 1 , severe nasal sinus disease, and psychological dysfunction [46, 47, 49] . Most fl ares are caused by infections, with a pathogen found in as many as 80% of acutely fl aring asthma patients [50] . Rhinovirus has been found in about two thirds of infection-triggered patients, and infection severity seems to correlate with fl are severity [50] . Given that asthma patients seem to have a higher susceptibility to infection, possibly caused by defects in innate immunity and interferon-\u03b3 cytokine production, fl are-prone asthma patients may have a more signifi cant defect that leads to frequent infections and thus exacerbations [50] . Finally, one recent study estimated that exposure of an asthma patient to an infection and an allergen trigger can increase the OR of fl are to 19.4 (95% CI, 3.1-101.5) [51] . Further elucidating the phenotype that is more likely to have severe fl ares regardless of baseline symptoms may signifi cantly increase future FEV 1 and the burden of asthma [16] .",
