These findings have potentially serious implications for the health system during an outbreak and in peace time as this factor likely applies to all disease and conditions. When patients are prepared to anticipate an untoward situation, they are more likely to cope effectively (11) . If persons do not present for treatment, their risk of a poor outcome increases. If they are likely to shun those who are ill, the likelihood of spread would be greater since infection control measures would not be maintained. A knowledge attitude and practices survey undertaken in Liberia (12) found that more than 90% of responders were fearful of EVD patients and of those who live with EVD patients. Choosing to attend traditional healers will lead to further spread as these practitioners would not usually have personal protective equipment and the appropriate training in their usage.",

The health workforce density in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia which were the three most affected countries is less than 1.5 per 10 000 population, 2.2 per 10 000 population and less than 3.7 per 10 000 population, respectively (13) . In comparison, in TT there are 8 physicians per 10000 people; there are 26 per 10 000 in the USA (14) . According to WHO at least 23 physicians, nurses and midwives per 10 000 population are needed for wellfunctioning primary healthcare interventions (15). The workforce should be well-qualified, capable, responsive and efficient. Lack of a skilled workforce was found to be a major factor in controlling the outbreaks. Lack of knowledge about basic infection prevention and control measures among health care workers was a critical factor in the outbreak response. Lack of PPE and knowing who to report to affected the outcome of the outbreaks (7). Training and rehearsing are critical to a smooth response (16, 17, 18) . However it should be noted that in several studies health workers indicated a reluctance to present to work under emergency conditions because of competing priorities such as family responsibility.",
