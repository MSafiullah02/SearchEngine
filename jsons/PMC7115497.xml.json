A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified to be the causative agent of SARS [1], [2], [3] and its genome sequence was published in 2003 [4], [5], [6]. The outbreak in 2002\u20132003 caused approximately 8000 SARS-related cases with a mortality rate of about 10%. This relatively high death rate coupled with the apparent ease of transmission of SARS-CoV, posed a serious public health threat and prompted considerable efforts to develop a safe and effective prophylactic vaccine for use in the event of a re-appearance of the disease.",

An inactivated whole SARS virus which was sequentially inactivated by formaldehyde treatment and UV irradiation, was shown to stimulate neutralizing and protective antibody responses in mice immunized subcutaneously [7]. Another whole virus vaccine comprising formaldehyde-inactivated, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated SARS virus given intranasally to mice, was reported to induce virus-specific lung IgA and serum IgG [8]. However, most SARS vaccine development has focused on subunit vaccines using the SARS spike glycoprotein (S-protein) which has been shown to contain the virus\u2019 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) as well as neutralizing epitopes, or fragments of the S-protein containing either the RBD or neutralizing epitopes [9]. For example, a recombinant baculovirus-expressed S-protein was shown to be capable of inducing high titers of neutralizing antibody when given intramuscularly to mice with or without Alum [10], and a recombinant S-protein fragment containing the RBD induced high titers of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV when used as a booster in mice which had been primed with DNA vaccines [11].",

            "text": "Infection with SARS virus is thought to be mediated by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a surface protein found on lung alveolar epithelial cells and on vascular endothelium [12]. Thus, it would be highly desirable for an effective vaccine to induce immunity in both the respiratory tract as well as in serum, i.e. mucosal and systemic immunity. This laboratory's approach has been to attempt the induction of both by mucosal immunization of mice with a subunit vaccine formulated with the proprietary adjuvant Protollin\u2014Shigella flexneri LPS non-covalently associated with major outer membrane proteins from Neisseria meningitidis (Proteosomes). In many pre-clinical studies, intranasal administration of vaccines comprising antigens formulated with Protollin have been shown to elicit potent mucosal as well as systemic immunity [13], [14], [15], [16], while clinical trials of Protollin alone (as an intranasal vaccine against Shigella disease) showed that it was safe and well-tolerated in human volunteers [17]. Thus, provided it was successful in eliciting appropriate immune responses in pre-clinical studies, a Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine would have the potential to be tested in clinical trials as a human SARS vaccine. This report documents pre-clinical feasibility studies in mice with intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein and compares the responses elicited and their phenotype with those elicited by an intramuscular Alum-adsorbed S-protein vaccine.",

Equal volumes of heat-treated sera at dilutions of 1:50 or 1:100 were incubated with 200 TCID50 of virus at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Surviving virus in the mixtures was titered by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Serial dilutions were plated in quadruplicate and the assay was performed in triplicate on the same plate for each serum. For the CPE assay, 0.1 mL of a neutralization sample was added directly to the cell culture plate containing cells at the appropriate cell density (1 \u00d7 104 Vero 76 cells/well) plated the previous day in 96-well plates. An additional 0.1 mL of cell growth medium containing 4% fetal bovine serum was then added to each well, gently mixed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 6 days which had been previously determined to be the optimal time required to achieve full cytopathic effect in the non-treated infectivity controls when using virus at 200 TCID50 units. The wells in the plate were then scored by visual observation for CPE or cytotoxicity using light microscopy. CPE was graded on a scale of 0\u20134, 0 indicating no cytopathic effect and 4 indicating complete cytopathic effect. Titers were then calculated using the Reed\u2013Muench equation [21]. The inverse of the last dilution of serum which completely protected cells from CPE was considered the virus neutralization titer for the serum. Results were expressed as geometric mean titers calculated from the replicate results for all mice within a treatment group.",
