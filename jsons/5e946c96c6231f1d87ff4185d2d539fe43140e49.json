The sudden appearance and the spread of HIV alerted the general public to the evils of pathogenic viruses and caught the attention of the media throughout the world. Since then, we have monitored the HIV outbreak and seen it growing and have been confronted with the threat of a SARS epidemic and, more recently, tried to prepare for a potential pandemic of H5N1 avian influenza variants. It is clear that there is an urgent need for more effective antiviral drugs, directed not only against what now can be termed the \"classical\" targets like polymerase and protease, but also against novel targets and with novel mechanisms of action. Such new approaches to antiviral therapy mainly targeting viral enzymes will be discussed in the following paragraphs.",

            "text": "Combination anti-HIV chemotherapy, commonly referred to as highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected patients (Lee et al. 2001 ). Thus far, over 20 anti-HIV drugs have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Despite the availability of these approved anti-retroviral drugs, there is still a need for new antiretrovirals to improve convenience, reduce toxicity and, of particular and growing importance, to provide activity against drug-resistant HIV strains (Pauwels 2004) , which not only emerge in infected individuals but are also being transmitted at increasing incidence. The first lead compounds for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTI) were discovered about 15 years ago (Pauwels et al. 1990; Merluzzi et al. 1990; Goldman et al. 1991; De Clercq 1993; R\u00fcbsamen-Waigmann et al. 1997) . Since then they have become an important ingredient of the drug combination schemes that are currently used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections. Starting from the HEPT and TIBO derivatives, numerous classes of compounds have been described as NNRTIs. Four compounds (nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz and etravirine) have so far been approved for clinical use and several others are the subject of clinical trials (Balzarini 2004; Stellbrink 2007) .",

Phase 3 clinical studies with rilpivirine are being initiated in 2008 and the results are eagerly awaited. The unmet medical need for NNRTIs with a higher barrier to resistance has led to increased interest in other next generation NNRTIs, which has in turn led to several more drugs currently in clinical development. Three drugs are currently in phase 2 (UK-453.061 from Pfizer, IDX 12899 from Idenix and RDEA-806 from Ardea Biosciences) and there are two more reported phase 1 activities (RDEA-427 from Ardea and MK-4965 from Merck).

Initially, integrase recognizes the long-terminal repeat (LTR) of the retro-transcribed viral DNA and performs endonucleolytic Fig. 1 Integration of HIV DNA into the host genome processing (3 -processing) of the 3 ends of both strands via recognition of an absolutely conserved CA dinucleotide and specific cleavage of the terminal GT dinucleotide downstream, thereby generating two recessed CA-3 -hydroxyl DNA ends that serve as nucleophiles in the following strand transfer step. During and after 3 -processing, a multimeric pre-integration complex (PIC) is formed, which comprises the integrase still bound to the viral cDNA as well as viral (reverse transcriptase, matrix, nucleocapsid and Vpr) and cellular factors (e.g. lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75), barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) and HMGA1) (for review see Turlure et al. 2004 ).

Ongoing clinical studies and experimental studies in animal models may shed more light on this question. The thus far unsurpassed potency of short-term viral load decay in raltegravir-containing regimens may also be of importance for the long-term performance of patients on HAART, since the time to suppression of viremia has been identified as an important prognostic indicator (Louie et al. 2003; Polis et al. 2001) .",

Elvitegravir, which needs to be boosted with ritonavir, was recently shown to be as effective as a boosted protease inhibitor regimen at cutting viral load in heavily pre-treated HIV-positive patients, according to phase II results. The drug-drug interaction studies are already completed and showed no interactions. Among the observed IN mutations, T66I and E92Q substitutions mainly contributed to elvitegravir resistance. Some resistance mutations conferred reduced in vitro-susceptibility to other IN inhibitors, including raltegravir, suggesting that a common mechanism is involved in resistance and potential cross-resistance. Based on the currently still limited data set, resistance to INSTI appears to develop faster than with protease inhibitors, but not quite as fast as with some of the NNRTIs. Furthermore, elvitegravir has to be boosted with ritonavir in contrast to raltegravir, and raltegravir has to be given twice daily. Without doubt, integrase inhibitors will add an important new weapon to the anti-HIV armamentarium. Currently, they are primarily used in salvage therapy regimens in multi-drug resistant patients, but may soon replace other drug classes in first-line HAART.",

An indication of the significance of this family of enzymes is seen in the so-called Werner syndrome, where the helicase function required in the suppression of inappropriate recombination events is defective and causes genomic instability and cancer (for a review see Cobb and Bjergbaek 2006) .",

From an evolutionary point of view, helicases can also be grouped into three superfamilies (Gorbalenya and Koonin 1993) : non-ring helicases are usually in SF1 or SF2 and ring helicases are in SF3. Helicases exhibit domains that are similar to a domain first identified in the RecA protein of E. coli. This domain has been identified as the motor of the helicase that is powered by the hydrolysis of NTP and drives the protein along the nucleic acid molecule. An NTP-binding site is usually found in the vicinity of the RecA-like domain. The herpes simplex virus genome expresses two helicases during its replication cycle, encoded by the viral genes UL5 and UL9. The former is found in a protein complex that also contains the primase protein (coded by UL52). As reported in 2002 (Crute et al. 2002; Kleymann et al. 2002) , both Boehringer/Biomega and Bayer developed highly specific inhibitors of the helicase-primase complex, and it is hoped that clinical trials will reflect the excellent in vitro activity and the in vivo efficacy already observed in several animal models of herpesvirus disease. More recently, Phase 2 studies with ASP2151, an inhibitor of the Herpes Virus helicase-primase that is under development by Astellas Pharma, have been initiated in patients with herpes zoster and genital herpes, in Japan and the USA (see info@astellas.com).",

Enzyme activity is usually assayed by measuring NTPase activity in the presence of an appropriate nucleic acid co-substrate although, more recently, novel fluorimetric and luminescence principles have been applied to the measurement of strand unwinding and/or translocation of the protein along the nucleic acid (Frick 2003 (Frick , 2006 .",

(2003) described a tetrabromobenzotriazole that inhibited the unwinding activity of HCV helicase, albeit at quite high \u03bcM concentrations, but did not inhibit its NTPase activity. Whether this compound also competes for the nucleic acid substrate is not clear, but this molecule and compound QU663 reported by Maga et al.

While the large subunit mediates sequence-specific DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis, pUL89 is required only for duplex nicking (Hwang and Bogner 2002; Scheffczik et al. 2002; Scholz et al. 2003) . The hydrolysis of ATP has multiple functions during the packaging process. It is also involved in the formation of the packaging complex. The large subunit pUL56 is stably associated with the capsid, represents a structural component and forms a dimer with C-2 symmetry (Beard et al. 2004; Catalano 2000; Sheaffer et al. 2001; Yu and Weller 1998; Savva et al. 2004 ).

The translocation of concatenated viral DNA into procapsids and its cleavage at packaging sites is not understood. Recent studies with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) mutants defective in UL6, UL15, UL25, UL28, UL32 or UL33 suggest that these genes are essentially involved in viral DNA cleavage and packaging, since cells infected with these mutants produce only B capsids lacking DNA (Al-Kobaisi et al. 1991; Baines et al. 1997; Weller 1996, 1998; McNab et al. 1998; Patel et al. 1996; Tengelsen et al. 1993; Yu et al. 1997) . The respective homologues of these genes in HCMV are UL104, UL89, UL77, UL56, UL52 and UL51 (Chee et al. 1990 ). By analogy to gp17, a known ATP-dependent endonuclease from bacteriophage T4, the HCMV UL89 gene may encode an endonucleolytic subunit of a putative HCMV terminase Rao 1993, 1994) . Studies by Bogner et al. (1998) suggest that the gene product of HCMV open reading frame (ORF) UL56 has specific nuclease activity, as well as specific binding affinity to packaging elements.",

During treatment with BAY 38-4766, viral protein synthesis continues, but due to the lack of monomeric genomic length DNA, only empty particles (dense bodies) can be formed. It is conceivable that these non-infectious viral particles could aid the establishment of an antiviral immune response, leading to better control of the virus by the host. This mechanism appears possible in all cases where an immuno-incompetent host (re)gains immune competence (newborns, transplant recipients). However, proof of this theoretical benefit will have to await clinical studies.",

The principal compound described in that paper, BAY 41-4109, is a non-nucleosidic, heteroaryl dihydropyrimidine (or HAP) inhibitor that appeared to block the replication of HBV by preventing the formation of high molecular weight viral core particles that are the site of DNA replication and are aggregates assembled from HBV core protein subunits (Fig. 4) . The authors concluded that the compound inhibited particle assembly and that there was an increased degradation of core protein that involved proteasome-related mechanisms. In HBV transgenic mice, this class of compound caused a dose-dependent reduction in viral DNA in the liver and blood plasma after oral application. Furthermore, it reduced the amount of core protein in the liver in contrast to the anti-HBV compound lamivudine (Weber et al. 2002) .",

Sticht and colleagues reported a 12-mer peptide that binds to the capsid protein altering the dimer interface and prevents self-assembly in this way (Sticht et al. 2005) .

By blocking this cleavage site, bevirimat blocks viral maturation and infectivity in tissue culture. It was granted fast-track development status by the US FDA in 2005 and has since completed a Phase 2b clinical study of five treatment-experienced patient cohorts. Unfortunately, Gag polymorphisms and pharmacokinetic factors appear to affect the response to bevirimat. However, when effective blood levels were achieved and the target virus lacked Gag polymorphisms, more than 90% of the patients responded to bevirimat, with a mean reduction in viral load of 1.26 log units (Panacos Pharmaceutical Inc., press release).",
