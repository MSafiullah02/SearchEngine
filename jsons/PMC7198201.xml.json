There have been appropriate but significant restrictions on routine medical care to comply with public health guidance on physical distancing, and to help preserve or redirect limited resources. Most invasive cardiovascular (CV) procedures and diagnostic tests have been deferred with North American cardiovascular societies advocating for intensified triage and management of patients on waiting lists4. Unfortunately, patients with untreated cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of adverse outcomes5. Delays in the treatment of patients with confirmed cardiovascular disease will be detrimental. Similarly, reduced access to diagnostic testing will lead to a high burden of undiagnosed cardiovascular disease that will further delay time to treatment. Although there will be a myriad of competing demands from multiple disciplines, this risk warrants the prioritization of cardiovascular patients as healthcare systems return to normal capacity4. While COVID-19 has had a global impact, there are regional differences in the burden of the pandemic. Some regions have not experienced a significant surge of cases variably related to social and health care adaptation measures, or the surge has passed and was less substantial than predicted. In these areas, there are available health sector resources that can be redeployed quickly. As regions move along the journey of managing the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an opportunity to reintroduce regular cardiovascular care in a progressive manner with appropriate safeguards.",

Regions must have the necessary critical care capacity, PPE, and trained staff available before the recommendations summarized in Table 1\ncan be implemented. Importantly, a transparent plan for testing and re-testing potential patients and HCWs for COVID-19 must be operationalized before elective procedures and tests are resumed. Additional considerations include:\n1) Physical distancing: Consider strategies to minimize patient contact with HCWs performing invasive cardiovascular procedures and diagnostic tests. These may include virtual pre-procedural clinics, virtual consenting for procedures and diagnostic tests, and minimizing the number of HCWs in physical contact with any given patient. Restrictions should be implemented on the number of people that can accompany a patient or visit a patient after a procedure or test. Whenever possible, multiple tests or procedures should be consolidated into a single comprehensive visit.\n2) COVID-19 Screening: Encourage routine screening of all patients prior to any cardiovascular procedure or test to ensure the safety of HCWs. This testing may include nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva or rapid antibody tests and should be guided by local institutional infectious disease experts and closely coordinated with regional public health officials. Key considerations include the availability and accuracy of the above tests as well as the frequency and timing of COVID-19 testing and re-testing. Appropriate PPE is required to protect HCWs even if patients are asymptomatic, as the sensitivity of available tests are low in this setting. A significant benefit of testing is the opportunity of defer COVID-19 positive patients if they remain clinically stable.\n",
