In April 2003, the complete human genome was announced and the project succeeded after spending $3-billion with a high-quality human reference genome (Schmutz et al., 2004). Although the assembly of such a huge genome is still a very challenging task, nowadays the sequencing can be done in just a few days and for only some thousands of dollars (Goodwin et al., 2016) by utilizing the still emerging NGS technologies.",

            "text": "In recent years, DNA sequencing (DNA-Seq) based on novel NGS technologies (Table 2\n) became the most sophisticated method for the sequencing of full genomes. A general DNA-Seq workflow starts with the library preparation including the fragmentation (chemically, physically) of the DNA molecules. After amplification and sequencing millions of short subsequences, so-called reads, are produced. In general, methods like Illumina and Ion Torrent produce reads with a length between 50 and 500 bp, depending on the setup and machine used (Goodwin et al., 2016). Next to that short read producing NGS technologies more and more long read NGS approaches are emerging. Very popular is the single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) introduced by Pacific Biosciences (Rhoads and Au, 2015) (PacBio) producing reads with an average length of 15,000 bp and a maximum of >40,000 bases. However, PacBio produces only \u223c50,000 reads per SMRT cell, whereas Illumina yields \u223c180 million reads on one HiSeq2500 lane (Goodwin et al., 2016). It is clearly important to produce longer reads to improve the results of various analyzes like the de novo assembly of highly repetitive, large or fast mutating genomes.",

            "text": "Nanopore sequencing is another recent incumbent in the SMRT area: the way nanopore-based sequencing works is by pulling a nucleotide strand (DNA or RNA) through a kind of molecular channel isolated from a bacterium. While passing through the pore, the nucleotide sequence produces a small change in the applied voltage, which can be reinterpreted as the familiar sequence of the bases A, C, T/U, and G, including also modifications such as methylation (Jain et al., 2016). Because each pore produces its own signal, this technology can be highly parallelized. For example, with the current USB-sized MinION sequencer, 2048 pores are situated on a membrane of the size of a finger nail. The sequencer itself costs a fraction of the aforementioned ones. Furthermore, each pore's signal can be detected in real time (Gardy et al., 2015), allowing unprecedented speed and mobility in sequence-based diagnostics, as exemplary demonstrated in field trials during the 2014 Ebola outbreak (Quick et al., 2016). Furthermore, nanopore sequencing is currently the only technique that does (in theory) not technologically limit the potential read length, which means an entire viral genome can be sequenced in one part at an intact pore. No additional assembly step would be required. The current read length maximum is >900 Kbp (personal communication with N. Loman). The MinION's throughput has been shown to provide up to 15 Gb in 48 h with a protocol-dependent error rate of 5%\u201315%.",

This \u201cclassification\u201d can be used to infer the viral population structure of each individual species in the sample, thereby increasing the resolution of the diversity estimate. (Intrahost) viral populations consist of many related virions, generated by mutation, recombination, and selection. The resulting diversity is especially large for RNA viruses (Holmes, 2009). Even low-frequency variants can be of great interest, for example, because they may harbor drug resistance mutations (Barzon et al., 2011), facilitate immune escape (Luciani et al., 2012), or affect virulence (T\u00f6pfer et al., 2013). Estimating intrahost viral genetic diversity and reconstructing the individual haplotype sequences relies on both error correction and read assembly (Pulido-Tamayo et al., 2015). It can be performed on different spatial scales, including single sites of the genome (single-nucleotide-variant calling), small sliding windows (local reconstruction), or complete genomes (global reconstruction). Viral haplotype reconstruction tools can quantify viral diversity from NGS data (e.g., Beerenwinkel et al., 2012). It was shown that haplotypes differ enough, current NGS reads are not too short and the coverage is high enough to assemble accurate viral haplotype genomes (Zagordi et al., 2012). A common prerequisite for these tools is a high-quality alignment of the reads (e.g., T\u00f6pfer et al., 2014). However, tools exist that allow haplotype calling without a reference genome as presented in Gregor et al. (2016). Nevertheless, the short-read-based discovery of viral sequences in mixed samples remains challenging (Marschall et al., 2016) because most analysis steps are not easily automated and various technical or biological limitations exist (Fricke et al., 2017). There is a need for an integrated workflow combining the different processing steps in viral diversity studies to discover the underlying virus populations that can be used on a daily basis by clinicians and virologists. The advent of SMRT sequencing provides new opportunities. One of the main limitations of the past was the limited length of the sequenced nucleotide fragments. Currently, it is not possible to write cDNA longer than a few thousand of nucleotides (e.g., \u223c2000 nucleotides for the wheat stripe rust pathogen (Ling et al., 2007)). However, even if the cDNA transcription would be no limiting factor, current short-read sequencing technologies such as Illumina are only able to sequence small fragments of several hundred nucleotides. Nanopore sequencing lifts these two constraints: it is now possible to sequence much longer fragments (as described above) and to sequence the RNA directly, without the need of a cDNA intermediate, advancing the detection of viral quasispecies.",

The generation of the library may involve steps like the fragmentation of longer RNA molecules, followed by the reverse transcription of the RNA to cDNA, ligation of adapters to the 5\u2032- and/or 3\u2032-ends of the cDNA fragments and PCR amplification to enrich the library for correctly ligated cDNA fragments (Corney, 2013). The resulting reads from an RNA-Seq experiment can be used to estimate the abundances of certain transcripts within each sequenced sample. If different conditions are sequenced, the obtained transcript abundances can be further used to identify differential expressed genes. Before RNA-Seq came up, gene expression studies were performed with hybridization-based microarrays. Contrasting the microarray technology, RNA-Seq allows for the identification of novel transcripts and does not necessarily need a sequenced reference genome. Furthermore, RNA-Seq allows for the genome-wide analysis of transcripts at a single-nucleotide resolution and therefore includes the identification of single-nucleotide variants, gene fusions, allele-specific expression, and alternative splicing events (Corney, 2013).",

The bat RNA was further pooled and additionally sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system. Initial quality control and trimming of the raw data were conducted with FastQC (Andrews, 2010) and PRINSEQ (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011). (2) For bat RNA, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed by combining MiSeq and HiSeq data using Velvet/Oases\nSchulz et al., 2012, Zerbino and Birney, 2008, ABySS/Trans-ABySS\nBirol et al., 2009, Simpson et al., 2009, SOAPdenovo-Trans (Luo et al., 2012), Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011), and Mira (Chevreux et al., 2004) with default parameters and multiple k-mer values, if possible. (3) The mapping of the RNA-Seq short-reads was performed for Mock-, EBOV-, and MARV-treated cells onto human/bat genomes and the bat transcriptome with Segemehl (Hoffmann et al., 2014) and TopHat (Kim et al., 2013). (4) A differential gene expression analysis was performed by counting uniquely mapped reads with HTSeq-count (Anders et al., 2015) and applying a DESeq (Love et al., 2014) analysis in R. The results were further used for clustering and scatter/group plot analyzes. (5) A homology search in bats was performed for all significantly differential expressed genes from (4) and for the genes assumed to be involved in the response to infection based on an enriched pathway analysis and the literature. The Rousettus aegyptiacus genome and coding sequences from Pteropus vampyrus, a closely related bat species, were used to validate but also to detect homologous sequences in the bat transcriptome. Detected homologs were employed for the differential gene expression analysis. (6) One huge advantage of this comprehensive study was the manual inspection of \u223c7.5 % of the human genes. Each candidate gene was manually investigated in the IGV (Thorvaldsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013) and UCSC (Dreszer et al., 2012) browsers for the human and bat samples from all time points. Single-nucleotide modifications (differential SNPs, posttranscriptional modifications), intronic transcripts and regulators, alternative splicing and isoforms, as well as upstream and downstream transcript characteristics were described.",

It is important that the phylogenetic methods can include the sampling dates of the sequences for analyzing short-term evolution as implemented in TipDate (Rambaut, 2000). Furthermore, spatial dispersal processes play an essential role, for example, the spatial distribution of a virus within the host's body (Bloomquist et al., 2010). Moreover, the evolutionary substitution rates of viruses can differ even for short-term evolutionary scenarios. One reason is that substitution rates reflect a complex product of mutation rate, generation time, effective population size, and fitness Jenkins et al., 2002, Sanjuan et al., 2010. Particularly in viruses, substitutions might be an artifact generated by polymerase errors and nucleotide modifications (Domingo and Holland, 1997). Thus, the classical assumption of a time-homogeneous substitution process used by different phylogeographic statistical inference methods does not hold and new approaches that can include varying evolutionary rates have been already introduced (e.g., Bielejec et al., 2014).",

A divergence of the host can also lead to a divergence of the virus (codivergence) and thus to a (local) congruence of both phylogenies. A match of the virus phylogeny with host evolutionary events at known dates can be used to adjust the virus phylogeny or corresponding molecular clocks (Sharp and Simmonds, 2011). The ability of viruses to switch their hosts can enable viruses to replicate and spread more efficiently. This process is commonly known as an epidemic and is observed in pathogenic viruses (Weiss, 2003). Owing to the advantages conferred by the conquest of new host territory, several researchers presume host switching as an elementary component of virus evolution that might initiate viral speciation (Kitchen et al., 2011). Attributed to the fact that virologists are highly interested in the reconstruction of the common history of viruses and their hosts, several bioinformatic tools have been developed for this purpose (de Vienne et al., 2013).",
