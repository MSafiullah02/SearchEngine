In this article, we argue against a blanket interpretation that being labeled \"essential personnel\" means that all in-person ABA services for all clients should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this argument holds even if ABA providers are not in a jurisdiction currently under an active shelter-at-home or related order. First, we provide a brief description of risks associated with continued in-person ABA service delivery, as well as risks associated with the temporary suspension of services or the transition to remote ABA service delivery. For many clients, continued in-person service delivery carries a significant risk of severe harm to the client, family and caregivers, staff, and a currently overburdened health care system. In these situations, ABA providers should temporarily suspend services or transition to telehealth or other forms of remote service delivery until information from federal, state, and local health care experts deems in-person contact safe. In rare cases, temporary suspension of services or a transition to remote service delivery may place the client or others at risk of significant harm. In these situations, in-person services should likely continue, and ongoing assessment and risk mitigation are essential.",

For example, Michigan (State of Michigan, 2020) and Ohio (State of Ohio, 2020) were among many states where ABA services for individuals with ASD were interpreted as essential. A major challenge in this designation is that inperson ABA service delivery likely involves physical contact or proximity between two or more people. This close contact places ABA providers 1 and ABA consumers, 2 and the community within which both groups travel, at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. This is a serious concern that should not be overlooked and raises an important question: Are ABA providers essential personnel?",

A recent analysis from China indicates that approximately 80% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . 3 ABA providers who continue to conduct in-person services are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 themselves because of their frequent contact with others, are likely to be unaware they have it, and will be unaware they are spreading the disease to others, including clients and their families. Ultimately, continuing to provide in-person ABA services increases the risk that more people will become ill than if in-person ABA services stop.",

            "text": "Participating in the spread of COVID-19 is ethically consequential for several reasons. As of writing this article on March 28, 2020, research from China estimates 14% of people who contract COVID-19 will require hospitalization and 2.3% of people who contract COVID-19 will die (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . This is ethically consequential for the health and life of ABA consumers and providers. Individuals with ASD are more likely to have allergies and autoimmune diseases than the general population (Chen et al., 2013) , placing them at greater risk of requiring hospitalization because of COVID-19. Under ideal conditions, many hospitals are not prepared to support the communication and behavioral needs of individuals with ASD (Vaz, 2010) . To compound the previous points, the states of Arizona and Washington have issued policies that people with disabilities have a lower priority to receive critical and lifesaving medical care (Silverman, 2020) , although these policies are out of compliance with the Office of Civil Rights (2020) bulletin issued on March 28, 2020. Even so, confusion around this issue could further limit access to lifesaving care for people with disabilities, including individuals with ASD. Efforts to keep clients out of the hospital must, therefore, be a top priority for ABA providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The BACB Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts (2014; hereafter referred to as the BACB Code) obligates Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) to operate in the best interests of their clients (Section 2.0) and to put their clients' care first (Section 2.04d). 4 In some situations, maximizing the best interest of a client and placing his or her care first might mean stopping in-person ABA services to reduce the likelihood that ABA consumers or providers (especially behavior technicians) contract COVID-19.",

There are currently not enough health care resources for everyone who contracts COVID-19. Because of the lack of health care resources, health care providers must make decisions that balance maximizing benefits and minimizing harms for each patient versus maximizing benefits and minimizing harms for an entire community.

However, we suspect it is a minority of consumers and that clients with these extremely severe behavioral topographies are an exception, not the norm. Nevertheless, in-person ABA services may be necessary to protect or sustain the life of a client in some situations, despite the risk of contracting COVID-19.

Some clients may have a history of, or currently display, challenging behavior that carries some probability of risk of harm to themselves and others.

The probability of harm from challenging behavior has to be balanced against the probability of contracting COVID-19 through continued in-person services. To compound this calculation, hospitalization also carries an increased probability of an unaffected patient contracting the virus while hospitalized because hospitals carry increased risk of hospital-acquired infection and disease (e.g., Chowdhury, Miller, Lewis, Niesley, & Patel, 2016; Gestal, 1987; Haverstick et al., 2017) .

As with many ethical dilemmas, this is a living, breathing decision-making context. Unlike many ethical dilemmas, the facts, probabilities, and risks of harm from contracting COVID-19 are dynamically changing. ABA providers will need to regularly reevaluate their decisions to provide or withhold treatment according to dynamically changing client needs.

ABA providers in leadership roles should not force unnecessary risk on ABA consumers (e.g., clients and their families), behavior technicians or their families, or the larger geographical community. If the client or the client's legal guardians have not requested for services to continue, then services should stop until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. If services are requested to continue, then ABA providers must decide whether they can pivot to telehealth or other remote service delivery method (e.g., phone). If they can pivot to telehealth, issues of training, scope of competence, and using the decision-making process of evidence-based practice need to be addressed. If ABA providers cannot pivot to telehealth, then the barriers and issues surrounding the effective and safe delivery of ABA treatment need to be addressed (BACB, 2014). If barriers are technological, the risks of serious illness or death from COVID-19 seem to outweigh the risks of withholding in-person services, and ABA services should be temporarily suspended while the infrastructure for remote service delivery is put in place. If the barriers are behavioral (i.e., severe risk of harm or regression), then standard practices of informed consent that include the potential risks associated with in-person delivery should follow. Of particular emphasis, we believe the consent of all ABA providers involved in conducting in-person services, including behavior technicians, must also be obtained. Next, we discuss each major point in turn.",

This recommendation holds even if ABA providers are not in a jurisdiction currently under a shelter-at-home order. Fortunately, an alternative behavior exists that is reimbursable and executable using readily available resources. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has mandated that the telehealth delivery of ABA services can be reimbursed through health insurance companies (HHS, 2020) . For those who lacked the infrastructure to provide telehealth services before the pandemic, the HHS has also stated that regulatory noncompliance law will be relaxed to allow health care providers to build out and learn to use telehealth modalities (HHS, 2020) . Given the widely available and accessible nature of audio (e.g., phone) and video (e.g., FaceTime, Zoom) technology, most ABA providers should be able to manage some degree of contact with clients while adhering to socialdistancing recommendations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). It is worth noting that some insurance funders strictly require HIPAA-compliant platforms in their documents approving the use of telehealth services, so best practice would be to exhaust compliant options first. In the event a noncompliant platform is used, this should be clearly stated as a risk to confidentiality in informed-consent documents presented before the provision of telehealth services.",

Within this conversation, it is important to note that some ABA providers may have preexisting conditions themselves that place them in a highrisk subgroup if they contract COVID-19. It is illegal for an employer to ask about the health status of an employee. To protect all ABA providers during the pandemic, agency leaders must respect any request for reassignment without penalizing the person who makes the request. Requiring behavior technicians, for example, to continue providing inperson services under threat of losing their jobs would be unethical and, in the long run, bad business for agency directors and owners.
