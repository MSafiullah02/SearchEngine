The genome is sufficiently unique to be proposed as belonging to a separate group designated as Group IV Marra et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003, but this view is not consensual and it has been noted that SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003). Nevertheless, the structural proteins S, M, N, and E have been clearly identified in virus grown in infected cells Marra et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003. The spike, or S-protein, protrudes from the outer surface and is a strong candidate for facilitating viral entry into host cells.",

(2003) have reported that the SARS-CoV S-protein efficiently binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 of SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells, suggesting that this binding is a key step in SARS-CoV infectivity. Interaction between the S-protein of a corona virus and specific mammalian receptors can determine species sensitivity. For example, when the S-protein ectodomain of mouse corona hepatitis virus was replaced with that of the feline infectious peritonitis virus, the viral particles were no longer infective for mouse cells, but became infective for feline cells (Kuo et al., 2000). SARS-CoV has been reported to infect domestic cats and ferrets (Martina et al., 2003) so these relationships may have relevance to this broader species susceptibility. A further example of interaction between the S-protein and mammalian receptors involves CD13 or aminopeptidase N. It is the main mammalian receptor for the S-protein of many coronaviruses. Substitution on human cells of the human CD13 N-glycosylation site with the porcine N-glycosylation site resulted in a failure to bind human corona virus-229E (Wentworth and Holmes, 2001).",

One possibility is to use a combination of peptides, such as those listed in Table 2, as a polyvalent antigen. Peptide-based vaccines have heretofore had only limited success but this can be attributed to a lack of knowledge as to which peptides to use. Such uncertainty is reduced by analyzing the antibody pattern in sera from cases that have successfully resolved the infection. Peptides making up the antigen can be screened in advance for homologies to mammalian proteins, reducing the possibility of self-attack. They can also be easily modified to cope with viral mutations that could escape traditional vaccines. Significant mutations have already been identified in SARS-CoV Ruan et al., 2003, Martina et al., 2003, indicating the necessity of developing adaptable vaccines.",

The software used for designing the arrays was from DIGEN, Jerini Biotools GmbH, Berlin, Germany. Membranes derivatized with a polyethylene (PEG) linker and a free amino terminal, as well as 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (fmoc) amino acids were obtained from Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments. The fmoc amino acids (0.25 M) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma, Oakville, Ont. Canada) and then activated with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT, Sigma) and N,N\u2032-disopropylcarbodiimide (DIPC, Sigma) for at least 15 min. They were then delivered to the membrane in 60-nl aliquots per spot by the robotic synthesizer. Fifteen minutes after completion of each cycle, the membranes were removed from the apparatus and treated with 2% acetic anhydride in DMF to acetylate any free remaining amino groups. They were then washed and further treated with 20% piperidine in DMF to remove the fmoc protecting group. This was followed by washing with DMF and methanol, and finally by air drying. The membrane was then precisely repositioned on the robotic apparatus to initiate the next coupling cycle. After the final cycle, the side chain protecting groups were removed by treatment with a solution of the following composition: 5 ml of 50% trifluoracetic acid; 5 ml dichloromethane (DCM); 300 \u03bcl triisopropyl silane (Sigma); and 200 \u03bcl water. Membranes were then washed twice with DCM, twice with DMF, and twice with methanol. After air drying, membranes were stored in a sealed bag at 4 \u00b0C until used.",

After washing, membranes were treated with 1/5000 dilutions (0.2 \u03bcg/ml) of goat antihuman IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). After washing in TBS-T, membranes were developed with an ECL chemiluminescence kit provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, England). Four milliliters of the two ECL Western blotting detection reagents were mixed before being applied on the membranes. The membranes were scanned using a Bio-Rad Fluorescent Imager (Hercules, CA) and saved for later analysis. The membranes were regenerated by incubation in 8 M urea/1% SDS overnight followed by 60 min in 50% ethanol/10% acetic acid.
