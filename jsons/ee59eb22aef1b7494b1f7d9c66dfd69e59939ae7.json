In almost two-thirds of RTIs in children, viruses are convicted as the principal cause. The most common respiratory viruses involved in are: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs). Recently, the importance of other viruses like metapneumovirus (MPV) and coronavirus (CoV) becomes evident [Mackie, 2003] .

The included subjects were neonates, infants and young children less than 5 years of both sexes. All patients presented at least two signs of acute respiratory tract infection including: cough, fever, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, sore throat, myalgia, wheezing, and respiratory distress [Bierbaum et al., 2014] . The exclusion criteria for this study were patients with immunosuppression, malignancy and autoimmune disease, and those receiving antiviral chemotherapy. Pertinent demographic and clinical information such as age, gender, ethnicity, onset and types of symptoms, underlying disorders, and vaccination history were obtained from the hospital records (Table I) . The study protocols conformed to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethical Committee of King Saud University. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected from hospitalized patients by a qualified nursing staff after getting informed consents from their legal guardians [Heikkinen et al., 2002] .

Monoplex gel-based RT-PCR assays were performed for the detection and typing of RSV, influenza and parainfluenza viruses using one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table SI. The reaction mixture was made up of 10 ml of RNA, 1\u00c2 Qiagen one-step RT-PCR buffer, 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 0.6 mM of sense and antisense primers, and 1 ml of Qiagen one-step RT-PCR enzyme mix. Amplification was accomplished in GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following reaction setup: cDNA synthesis at 50\u02daC for 30 min; initial PCR activation at 95\u02daC for 15 min; 35-40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u02daC for 30 sec, annealing at 50\u02daC (PIVs and influenza viruses) or 52\u02daC (RSV) for 30 sec, and polymerization at 72\u02daC for 1-2 min; and final extension at 72\u02daC for 10 min. RT-PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gel and were visualized using IMAGO imaging system (B&L systems, Netherlands). Genesig standard onestep real-time RT-PCR kits (PrimerDesign, Southampton, UK) were used to detect HMPV and human coronaviruses of group 1b (NL63 and E229) and group 2a (OC43 and HKU1). The assays were carried out separately according to the manufacturer's protocol on ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Samples with C T values higher than or equal to 40 were considered negative, while those higher than 35 and less than 40 were re-tested for confirmation. Data were entered into spreadsheet databases using Microsoft 1 Excel and cleaned from abnormal figures. Values were expressed as percentages and frequencies for discrete/categorical variables. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics like mean, median and standard deviation (SD) were utilized. Chi-squared test was used for identification of statistical significant values (P-values <0.05).",

RSV was the most common virus identified in patients younger than 6 months accounting for 43.2% of positive cases (P \u00bc 0.018). In the other age groups, the incidence of RSV infection decreased steadily and represents 30.6% and 20.8% of the cases respectively. PIVs and CoVs have the same age distribution of RSV with less significance (P \u00bc 0.529 and 0.109, respectively), whereas MPV appears to dominate in children aging from 6 to 24 months (P \u00bc 0.004). The prevalence of influenza A virus in the first two age groups was moderate, while it constitutes 50% in patients older than 2 years (Tables I and II ).",

The rate of detection of respiratory viruses was insignificant relevant to the periods of hospitalization (P \u00bc 0.84) with two obvious peaks at March 2008 and January 2009.

PIVs did not show any temporal peaks and were evenly distributed throughout the study course (Fig. 1) . Recognition of the spectrum and diversity of respiratory viruses in Saudi population is critical not only for determining appropriate disease control measures in Saudi Arabia, but it also provides an early alarming system for emerging viruses worldwide. In the current study, the respiratory viruses were detected in 60.34% of a cohort of hospitalized children at KKUH in Riyadh. According to the best of our knowledge, this rate of detection is the highest of all studies conducted in Saudi Arabia [Al-Shehri et al., 2005; Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013; Al-Ayed et al., 2014] . The relative increase in the detection level is possibly a result of using highly sensitive molecular techniques, the inclusion of more viruses in the diagnostic array, and/or the retrieval of samples only from hospitalized symptomatic patients.",

It is well-documented that RSV contributes in the majority of acute RTIs that requires hospitalization in children of pre-school age [Collins and Crowe, 2007] . The worldwide prevalence of RSV infection in this age group varies widely depending on geographical and chronological factors but mostly ranges from 14.1% [Kwofie et al., 2012] to 50% [Meqdam et al., 1997] . In Saudi Arabia, the diversity in occurrence is much profound with limits that extend from 24.4% [Al-Ayed et al., 2014] to 95.5% [Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013] in positive samples, which may reflect bias in sample collection. Not only the prevalence of RSV in this study matches the national and international figures, but it also reflects the dominance of type A viruses in most communities and seasonal outbreaks [Zhang et al., 2007] . For the prevalence of other respiratory viruses in the study group, it seems that all of them lie in the upper worldwide expected range. It is notable that no previous records in Saudi Arabia have shown a prevalence of MPV and CoVs in positive samples exceeding 9.6% and 2.96% respectively [Al-Ayed et al., 2014] [compare with 18.1% and 13.3% in this study].",
