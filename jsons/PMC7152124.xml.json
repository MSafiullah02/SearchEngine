Respiratory failure requiring hospitalization and intensive care has been seen in most of the 1140 recognized cases, and mortality is as high as 50%.",

Direct fluorescent antibody tests are available for influenza and require approximately 2 h. They will detect animal subtypes such as H5N1. Rapid bedside tests to detect influenza A have been used as screening tools for avian influenza in some settings. Throat swabs tested by reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been the most sensitive for confirming H5N1 infection to date, but nasopharyngeal swabs, washes, and aspirates; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid; lung and other tissues; and stool have yielded positive results by RT-PCR and viral culture with varying sensitivity. Convalescent-phase serum can be tested by microneutralization for antibodies to H5 antigen in a small number of international reference laboratories. Specimens from suspected cases of H5N1 infection should be sent to public health laboratories with appropriate biocontainment facilities; the case should be discussed with health department officials to arrange the transfer of specimens and to initiate an epidemiologic evaluation. Recommendations for such testing will evolve on the basis of the features of the pandemic, and guidance should be sought from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) Web sites (http://www.cdc.gov and http://www.who.int).",

Most H5N1 isolates since 2004 have been susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir and resistant to the adamantines (amantadine and rimantadine). Patients with suspected H5N1 infection should be treated with oseltamivir and antibacterial agents targeting S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, the most common causes of secondary bacterial pneumonia in patients with influenza. The current recommendation is for a 5-day course of treatment at the standard dosage of 75 mg two times daily. Treatment recommendations may vary considerably with changes in the pandemic situation. More specific guidance can be found on the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), American Thoracic Society (ATS), CDC, and WHO Web sites. In addition, droplet precautions should be used for patients with suspected H5N1 influenza, and they should be placed in respiratory isolation until that etiology is ruled out. Health care personnel should wear N-95 (or higher) respirators during medical procedures that have a high likelihood of generating infectious respiratory aerosols.",
