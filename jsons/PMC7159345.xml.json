Waterborne diseases are frequently caused by enteric pathogens, which belong to the group of organisms transmitted by the faecal\u2013oral route 3. The World Health Organisation (WHO), states that there are \u223c2.2 million deaths related with hazardous water conditions, sanitation and hygiene, and millions more suffer numerous incidents of non\u2010fatal diarrhoea every year 4. Water quality concerns have increased in recent years, in part due to recurrent contamination of surface water resources by waterborne bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens 5.",

The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention 8 projected that viral infection may be responsible for almost half of all acute gastrointestinal diseases, and therefore, viral contamination of recreational coastal water is of paramount importance and is a rising public health concern 9. Enteric viruses have a relatively low infectious dose and can be responsible for a large range of human illnesses such as paralysis, meningitis, respiratory diseases, myocarditis, congenital abnormalities, epidemic vomiting, diarrhoea and hepatitis 10, 11. Nevertheless, it is now accepted that viral contamination should be definitely taken into account in the microbiological analysis of water and food 12.",

Routine viral monitoring is not required for drinking or recreational waters and neither is it required for wastewater that is discharged into the environment. This lack of a monitoring effort is due largely to the lack of methods that can rapidly and sensitively detect infectious viruses in environmental samples 14. Phages share many properties with human viruses, particularly composition, morphology and structure 15, 16. Phages, especially somatic coliphages and F\u2010RNA coliphages, have been recommended as alternate microbial indicators as they behave more like the human enteric viruses which pose a health risk to water consumers if water has been contaminated with human faeces 17, 18.",

It is well recognised that monitoring the presence of enteric viruses could be challenging due to the relatively low level of infectious viral particles towards the respective host species and small viral particle size existing in environmental waters, thus making it essential to start with a large water sample volume and concentrate it to several orders of magnitude 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. However, this limitation can be overcome by the use of improved methods for aquatic sample concentration, viral infectivity and more sensitive viral detection techniques 32. Tangential\u2010flow and hollow\u2010fibre ultrafiltration (UF) have been used to investigate microbial contamination of drinking water 33, 34.

Three known viruses: human adenovirus, group A rotavirus and coxsackie B virus were used as positive controls. Amongst the cell lines used for human virus investigations in water were, the A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell), Hela (human cervical cancer cell), HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell), PLC/PRF/5 (human primary liver carcinoma cell) and Vero (African green monkey kidney cell). Cells were grown in 10% Dulbecco's modified essential medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (GIBCO) containing a penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone mix (1:1:1) by volume, to confluent monolayers in 24 well tissue culture plates (Corning, USA). Approximately 200 \u00b5L of viral concentrate was overlaid onto the monolayers of appropriate cell lines and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5\u20137 days. The development of cytopathic effect (CPE) that is indicative of a viral infection in the cell cultures was monitored for up to 7 days. Presence or absence of CPE (loss of cell to cell contact and detachment) was confirmed as described in US EPA 43. After three freeze\u2013thaw cycles, CPE positive and negative samples were filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filters and were inoculated in new A549, HEK293, Hela, HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells for another seven days. The CPE of cell culture was inspected under an Olympus microscope at 400\u00d7 magnification. Samples that showed CPE at the end of the confirmation step were reported as positive for infectivity. The MTT (3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay was performed using the cell lines mentioned above 44.

After 6\u20137 days, the medium was removed and MTT solution was added to the wells, and further incubated at 30\u00b0C for 4 h. Thereafter the MTT solution was removed and DMSO was added to the wells. The cell viability (%) was determined by the optical density of cells at 570 nm using a Mindray 96A microplate reader (Vacutec, South Africa) according to the method of Heldt et al. 44. The CPE was calculated as the percentage of cell death due to the viral infection comparing to the control.",

Members of morphotypes A1 (Myoviridae) were detected in 25% of the samples, and C1 (Podoviridae) was present in substantial (20%) numbers. The phages tagged as A1/B1 were not conclusive in morphological appearance and could not be classified. Table 2 illustrates the size range of the bacteriophages that could be observed during all four seasons. Phage head diameters ranged from 48\u201359 nm (winter) to 42\u201379 nm (summer), with the general mean value of phage heads being 57 nm. The tail length of the phage populations varied throughout all seasons from 69 nm in autumn to 352 nm in summer. Interesting to note was that the total length of phages varied extensively, ranging from 150 nm (autumn), 181 nm (winter), 290 nm (spring) to 218 nm (summer).",

Although the occurrence of human enteric viruses has been demonstrated in surface water bodies as well as in drinking water supplies throughout the world and several outbreaks of enteric viral diseases (attributed to either contamination of drinking water or vegetables and seafood grown in such waters) have been recorded 56, 57. Routine examination of water samples for the presence of enteric viruses is not largely performed in both developed and developing countries 57. In this study, the populations of somatic and F\u2010RNA coliphages as well as various enteric viruses were monitored using traditional techniques such as electron microscopy and tissue culture.",

All sampling points throughout all seasons tested positive for the presence of somatic coliphages which ranged from 10 pfu/mL (U5\u2013autumn) to 659 pfu/mL (U1\u2013summer) especially in the lower reaches of the river and during summer. F\u2010RNA coliphage counts were significantly lower compared to those of somatic coliphage counts. F\u2010RNA coliphages, from 0 pfu/mL (U5\u2013autumn) to 550 pfu/mL (U2\u2013summer), were also detected more frequently in the lower reaches of the river. Mean concentrations of somatic coliphages and F\u2010RNA coliphages were comparable between autumn and spring and correlation analysis resulted in a strong Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.977 (p < 0.01). Bacteriophages are not a stable part of water micro\u2010flora and their presence is usually associated with wastewater inflow rich in animal and human excrement 58. Their survivability depends upon physico\u2010chemical environmental conditions 59. Somatic coliphages have been found to outnumber F\u2010RNA phages in waste water and raw water sources by a factor of about 5, and cytopathogenic human viruses by about 500 60, 61, thus making them valuable indicators for assessing the behaviour of and the possible presence of enteric viruses in water environments. Male\u2010specific (F\u2010RNA) coliphages are highly specific for sewage pollution and cannot be replicated in water environments, but detection methods are more complicated 62.",

Umgeni River points U1, U2 and U3 were more contaminated with phage and virus\u2010like populations than points U4 and U5. Increasing in the phage and VLP populations from upstream to the river mouth were observed in all seasons. This was probably because the river flows through the more urbanised areas of Durban and is subject to higher surface runoff 63. It can be speculated that increased human activity as well as informal settlements and trading activities in the storm water drain catchment areas contributed to the high levels of phage populations downstream the river at points U1, U2 and U3. The thicket and bushland that enclosed both the Krantzkloof Nature Reserve (U4) and Inanda Dam (U5) can serve as vegetated pervious buffers as passive treatment systems allowing agricultural and storm water runoff to reach the river and dam in a less impaired state 35. Mallin et al. 64 found that human development along the land\u2013seawater interface is considered to have significant environmental consequences resulting in a difference in abundance and distribution of the enteric pathogen indicator microbes and can often pose an increased human health risk.",

The two\u2010step filtration procedure used in our laboratory involved fluid flowing parallel to the 0.22 \u00b5m TFF filter surface. Particles with molecular weights (M\nw) smaller than the exclusion size (0.22 \u00b5m) of the filter passed through and collected (filtrate) in a reservoir which was further concentrated through a 100 kDa spiral wound TFF unit. Particles with larger molecular weights were retained and recycled to the original reservoir (retentate). Thus, as the filtration continued, the retentate volume decreased until the desired volume was attained. The TEM study demonstrated that the two\u2010step TFF procedure coupled with ultracentrifugation produced a viral concentrate devoid of bacteria, with most viruses being intact. The phage/VLPs concentrations in every sample were high enough to view on formvar coated electron microscopic grids without enrichment. All water samples in this study contained a mixture of morphologically different tailed phage viruses, which were regarded as bacteriophages. It was possible to observe viral particles with long tails (B1\u2010Siphoviridae), short tails (A1\u2010Myoviridae and C1\u2010Podoviridae), and without tails. The phages particles observed without tails may belong to a wide range of hosts, including eukaryotes 66. Most of the phages from the Umgeni River were intact, with discrete structures such as tail fibres, base plates, and other appendages which are pertinent for the recognition of and interaction with the host cell. These accessories may be an indication that a significant proportion of the phages are suspended in the water environment as potentially infective particles. The main purposes of phage classification are generalisation and simplification, which facilitates comparisons and understanding of viruses 67. The high morphological diversity of phage communities corresponds well with the great variability and dynamics of bacterial populations obtained in this current study. Electron microscopy provides a direct insight into the morphological variability of phage present in the water environment, without being dependent on the isolation of suitable host strains. This is important, as bacteria which are not cultivable under laboratory conditions usually dominate aquatic environments and may be important phage hosts 68.",

Most of the viruses were detected downstream of the river towards the river mouth area during the spring and summer seasons. The viral contamination of these widely used areas could be attributed to storm water discharge, surface runoff, sewage discharge and overflows, recreational exposure and other anthropogenic activities 63. The detection of viruses by TEM in the sampling points upstream of the Umgeni River was relatively low or non\u2010existent, probably due to the stagnant waters and limited recreational exposure. Several presumptive virus types including Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae (norovirus), Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae (influenza virus), Picornaviridae (enterovirus), Poxviridae and Reoviridae (rotavirus) were found in the Umgeni River during all seasons based on the morphologies under TEM. Human viruses seen in negative stains fall into one of two major morphological categories: enveloped or naked 64. Enveloped viruses have a nucleocapsid (the nucleic acid held together by some structural proteins) inside, whilst naked viruses are icosahedral, their protein coat or capsid is more rigid and withstands the drying process well to maintain their spherical structure in negative stains 50. Naked human viruses are of three size ranges: (i) 22\u201335 nm (e.g. parvoviruses, enteroviruses and caliciviruses), (ii) 40\u201355 nm (polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses) and (iii) 70 \u00d7 90 nm (reoviruses, rotaviruses and adenoviruses) 69. As a general pattern, the virus population was dominated by small forms (<40 nm), and tails were rarely seen, which is in agreement with the results reported by several authors 66, 70, 71, 72. The negative staining technique for TEM allowed for the examination of particulate material including determination of structure and size of particles and has proved important in virological studies 50. All water samples analysed were environmental in nature, thus natural degradation may have altered the morphological features of the viruses substantially 50.",

However, it has provided no information on viral viability and infectivity in a specific environment. The tissue culture assay is the only US EPA approved method for virus infectivity monitoring in aquatic samples 73. Virology laboratories have traditionally used tissue culture cell lines to amplify the amount of virus present in a water sample, express the viral antigens and in many cases monitor the cell death as a consequence of the viral infection producing characteristic CPEs in the cell monolayer. The tissue culture technique has been used extensively for virus replication and infectivity studies and plaque assays 74. It has been established that for the recovery of a maximum number of infectious viruses, it is often necessary to inoculate each sample type into several different cell culture lines because no single cell culture is available with susceptibility to all enteric virus types 74. In the present study six cell lines (the A549, HEK293, Hela, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5 and Vero) were used to determine CPE of the VLPs from the Umgeni River during four seasons. All VLP samples from all sites and seasons produced substantial CPEs on the Vero, HEK293, Hela and A549 cell lines. This effect was tested against positive controls of three known viruses (voxsackievirus, rotaviruses and adenovirus) in the same cell lines. Vero cells are sensitive to infection with many different viruses 74. Human embryonic kidney cell line 293A and human lung carcinoma cell line A549 were the most penetrating to viral infection, especially to enteric adenovirus 40 and 41 75. Grabow et al. 76 reported the propagation of both enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41 in the primary liver carcinoma (PLC/PRF/5) cell line. Hep\u2010G2 cell lines are often used to study Hepatitis B, C and other viruses 74. CPE of the VLPs was examined by microscopy every day for the first week of growth to maximise the detection of viral progression. Certain viruses take one day to three weeks to yield a CPE dependent on the initial concentration and virus type. CPE can be swelling, shrinking, rounding of cells to grouping or whole destruction of the monolayer 77. All the VLPs isolated from water samples were capable of inducing the CPEs on six tissue cell lines. The ability of these viruses to infect susceptible host cells and to replicate their DNA/RNA, confirms that they are viable and infectious and therefore constitute a health risk which is due to be investigated 18, 78.",

A setup for the concentration of viruses from large (20 L) volume water samples using a two\u2010step TFF process was successfully established. Electron microscopy illustrated the presence of VLPs in concentrated water samples at all sites sampled, and their infectivity was established based on their CPE on various cell lines. The results produced suggest the infectious potentials of the VLPs in the Umgeni River water samples, especially river water from the lower catchment areas, to infect the human hosts throughout the year. These observations have serious health care implications if raw untreated water is used for human consumption. However, it should also be considered that not all viral particles detected in this study correspond to infectious viral particles and a high percentage of non\u2010infectious viral particles may be present in the environment 76. The present study thus highlights the importance of routine environmental surveillance of human enteric viruses for a better understanding of the actual burden of these viral infections on those who might be using the water directly without treatment.",
