Grazing affects the plant community directly through disturbances such as defoliation and trampling and indirectly by selective grazing and litter removal, which can result in a change in species composition, and warmer and drier soils. Heavy grazing pressure has, therefore, led to grassland degradation.",

It is an important component of the semi\u2010arid grassland ecosystem, where it ameliorates the soil temperature and interacts with the hydrological cycle, thereby affecting available soil water for plant growth. Litter can improve soil water by trapping snow (Willms & Chanasyk 2006), enhancing water infiltration and reducing evaporation by acting as an insulating layer on the soil surface (Willms et al. 1993; Dormaar & Carefoot 1996). However, litter also intercepts precipitation and prevents a portion of it from reaching the soil surface (Naeth et al. 1991; Pierson et al. 2002). The semi\u2010arid grasslands are water\u2010limited and any effect on soil water will impact other ecosystem processes, including plant growth and competitive interactions.",

Litter may also produce warmer soil temperatures in autumn, thereby extending the growing season; conversely, it may impede soil warming in spring (Knapp & Seastedt 1986; Facelli & Pickett 1991). The net effect will depend on the presence of other constraints on the plants' ability to grow.",

Litter mass was positively associated with above\u2010ground production (ANPP) in semi\u2010arid grasslands (Willms et al. 1993; Deutsch et al. 2010) through its effect on enhancing available soil water to the plant. However, its effectiveness depends on the climatic conditions within a year (Willms et al. 1993) and the characteristics of the plant community. The effectiveness of litter mass among communities is inversely correlated with soil water; therefore, it is most effective where water deficits are greatest and least effective where available soil water is high. However, this relationship is likely not linear because too much litter will impede production in the more mesic tallgrass prairie (Knapp & Seastedt 1986). Thus, the effectiveness of litter on ANPP reaches a threshold after which it declines with increasing litter mass.",

However, litter may not be as effective on the typical steppe as it is on the Northern Great Plains because of differences in precipitation distribution. In Inner Mongolia, about 70% of annual precipitation occurs in June, July and August, with only about 4% occurring from December to March. This compares with summer and winter precipitation, for the same months, of 38% and 20%, respectively, of total annual precipitation at two widely separated sites in the mixed prairie in Canada (W.D. Willms, pers. observ.). Therefore, snow capture and retention is relatively less important on the typical steppe than in the mixed prairie, while the coincidence of the majority of precipitation with the growing season ensures that the plant is able to use it with maximum efficiency. These dynamics may contribute to forage production, which is about twice as high on the typical steppe as on the mixed prairie, despite receiving about 18% less precipitation, while ANPP in the mixed prairie may increase by up to 60% along a gradient of increasing litter mass (Willms et al. 1993). Similar observations of litter mass and ANPP are not available for the typical steppe.",

The effects of overgrazing are direct, caused by the disruption of plant energy relations, and indirect through modifying the plant environment, which is affected largely by litter reduction. The two factors can produce similar effects in species shifts and productivity thereby making the causes difficult to separate.",

The average altitude is 1400 m above sea level. This area belongs to the continental middle temperate semi\u2010arid zone (Chen 1988). The winters are cold and dry while the summers are warm and wet. The long\u2010term (1970\u20132007) mean annual temperature at the study area is 0.4 \u00b0C, with mean monthly temperatures ranging from \u221221.4 \u00b0C in January to 19.0 \u00b0C in July. Mean annual precipitation is 337 mm. About 80% of annual precipitation occurs between May and August, which coincides with the highest temperatures. The soils are classified as Chestnut sandy loam, while the dominant plant species were Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel and Stipa grandis P. A. Smirn. Heavy grazing pressure reduced the concentration of soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen by about 33% compared to an ungrazed control in a nearby (100 km) typical steppe grassland (Q.B.

The apparent link of litter to moisture effectiveness was also noted by Willms et al.

Precipitation in 2005 was almost 50% of the long\u2010term average, which may have produced unusual stress on the species and a more distinct response to litter removal.

We expect that the greatest response would occur during the first year after treatments, but an additive response is likely with repeated applications of either litter removal or addition. Litter management provides a means for optimizing forage for livestock production and a strategy for adapting to an expected warmer and drier climate (Wang et al. 2003; IPCC 2007). Litter accumulation on a mixed prairie site following 70 years of protection from grazing resulted in an accumulation of almost 3000 kg of litter ha\u20101, which was associated with 29% more ANPP than on contiguous grazed sites where litter mass was about 950 kg ha\u20101 (Willms et al. 2002). The residual mass of litter after grazing provides an index of grazing pressure and has a direct and indirect effect not only on ANPP but also on the quality of habitat for wildlife and watershed characteristics. Therefore, litter biomass provides crucial support for the production of ecosystem goods and services in this grassland and should be incorporated into an index of health for grazed semi\u2010arid grasslands, as has been done by Adams et al.
