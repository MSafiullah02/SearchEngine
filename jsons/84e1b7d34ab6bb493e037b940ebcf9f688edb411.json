Within this context, successful results have been achieved based on the distributional hypothesis and/or the paradigmatic assumption. However, both strategies solely rely on the input words to predict the lexical semantic relation. In this paper, we make the hypothesis that the decision process should not only rely on the input words but also on their K closest neighbors in some semantic space. For that purpose, we present different binary and multi-task classification strategies that include two distinct attention mechanisms based on PageRank. Evaluation results over four gold-standard datasets show that average improvements of 10.6% for binary and 8% for multitask classification can be achieved over baseline approaches in terms of F1. The code and the datasets are available upon demand.",

In this paper, we make the assumption that finding the lexical semantic relation that holds between two words does not solely rely on the pair itself, but also on the semantically related neighboring words. Our hypothesis relies on two different ideas. First, studies about the mental lexicon [13, 23] theorize that words are highly interconnected within a mental semantic network, such that conceptual information is encoded in one's mind rather than single words alone. Second, studies in image segmentation show that dividing up an image into a patch work of regions, each of which being homogeneous, leads to successful results [18, 20] . Analogously, we propose to define a word patch as a source word augmented by its semantically close related neighbors, and expect that performance gains can be achieved by grounding the decision process on finding representation regularities between word patches.",

On the one hand, pattern-based methods rely on lexico-syntactic patterns, which connect a pair of words [12, 17, 25, 29, 32, 33] . On the other hand, the distributional approach consists in characterizing the semantic relation between two words based on their distributional representations, thus following Harris distributional hypothesis [11] . In this case, a word pair can be represented by the concatenation of the context vectors of the individual words [2, 28, 32, 39] or by their difference [7, 37, 39] . The main drawback of the distributional hypothesis is that it conflates different semantic relations between words. Therefore, different solutions have been proposed to overcome this issue. First, specialized similarity measures can be defined to distinguish different relations [29] . Another solution is to specialize word embeddings for particular relations using external knowledge [9, 36] . However, these methods are one-relation specific and cannot differentiate between multiple semantic relations at a time. So, multi-task learning strategies have been proposed [1] , which concurrently learn different semantic relations with the assumption that the learning process of a given semantic relation may be improved by jointly learning another semantic relation.",

A similar idea is proposed by [14] , who presented a set cardinality-based method, which exploits WordNet [24] to compute related neighboring words. In particular, they show that the features extracted from set cardinalities produce competitive results compared to word embedding approaches for a large set of word similarity tasks. However, their methodology relies on the pre-existence of a knowledge base, which is not available for a vast majority of languages. Moreover, their hypothesis builds on discrete representations of words, which cannot account for word continuous similarities and thus highly relies on representative 1 set intersections. Also, only word similarity tasks are tested and it is difficult to access to what extent their methodology can adapt to lexical semantic relation identification. Furthermore, in their proposal, all neighboring words receive the same importance for the decision process, although by extending the semantic scope of each individual word, semantic shifts may occur as well as concept centrality may be lost.",

They clearly evidence the superiority of the sequential architecture, which produces best results in 6 learning situations out of 8 in terms of F 1 score 4 . In particular, for RUMEN, it outperforms the second best strategy by 2% for synonymy. For ROOT9, improvements of 0.9% are obtained for hypernymy. For WEEDS, increases of 2.8% for co-hyponymy and 8.1% for hypernymy are obtained. For BLESS, enhancements of 0.2% and 2.4% are respectively achieved for meronymy and hypernymy over the second best approach. Interestingly, the parallel architecture is not capable of taking advantage of the second attention mechanism (i.e. centrality between patches) as it is the case for the sequential model. The inability of the parallel architecture to combine both attention mechanisms can be explained by two factors. First, in the parallel architecture, individual word embeddings can receive different PageRank weights depending on the attention mechanism. But, as these weights are not explicitly combined, the neural network may not be able to compute regularities between different weights for the same input. The other reason can be explained by the tree structure of human knowledge [38] , that theorizes that the cognitive process of human acquisition is agglomerative. Results also evidence clear superiority of attention-based strategies compared to attentionunaware patch-based models i.e., Patches, Concat + SP and Patches + SP. On average overall all datasets and all classification tasks, an increase of 3.5% is achieved by the best attention-based model compared to the best attention-unaware configuration containing neighbor information. Moreover, if we compare the sequential architecture to the current non-patch baseline i.e. Concat + cos, the difference in performance is much more important. In particular, an average improvement of 10.6% can be attained, with a minimum increase of 1.7% for RUMEN (hypernymy) and a maximum gain of 30.1% for BLESS (hypernymy). Results also show that the simple introduction of neighbors, i.e. without attention mechanisms, cannot account systematically for increase in performance. Indeed, if we compare Concat + cos and its direct counterpart Patches + SP that includes the neighbor information both in terms of semantic content and similarity, best results are obtained for the second strategy in 6 cases out of 8. This means that in two situations, the introduction of more information does not lead to improvements. By looking in more details and comparing Concat to Patches, we can see that better results can be obtained in only half of the cases by the introduction of neighbor embeddings.",

            "text": "In fact, going further in the analysis and looking at the results of Concat + SP, we clearly understand that the improvement in results comes from the SP matrix and not from the concatenation of the embeddings. Indeed, the Concat + SP strategy shows improved results in 6 cases out of 8 over the more complete Patches + SP configuration, with an average increase of 3.6%. This situation can be explained by the inability of the neural network to focus on the meaningful word embeddings. Indeed, by just concatenating all neighbor embeddings, all words become equal for the decision process, although this should not be the case. As such, attention mechanisms allow to overcome this situation. Finally, we can observe that different values of K are obtained for all tested situations. First, if we compare the best attention-based model with the best attention-unaware configuration 5 for all the classification tasks, it is clear that smaller values of K are needed for models with attention. On average, attentionaware models find optimal results for K = 5.4, while configurations without attention attain maximum performance for K = 7.4. This situation can easily be explained as the best attention-unaware model is Concat + SP, which does not include the embeddings of the neighbors. As such, the only information from the neighbors is given by the SP matrix, which must give trace of all the information alone between patches. As a consequence, only large matrices can account for the extra information included in the patches. Results also show that different values of K can be obtained for the same semantic relation depending on the dataset, although some regularities seem to exist. For instance, for hypernymy, best results are obtained for K = 9 for WEEDS, but the best results for RUMEN, BLESS and ROOT9 are obtained for K = 2. Furthermore, by comparing symmetric (synonymy, co-hyponymy) and asymmetric (hypernymy, meronymy) relations, results show that best results are obtained for K = 7.4 on average in the first case, and for K = 6 on average in the second case, thus suggesting the need for less extra-knowledge for asymmetric semantic relations. This can be explained by the semantic shift phenomenon [4] . When dealing with asymmetric relations, it is likely that one of the words within the pair is a general word. As a consequence, when expanding the general word with its neighbors, it is likely that a semantic shift occurs. As a consequence, it is conceivable that smaller values of K are preferred for asymmetric relations.",

            "text": "Multi-task Classification: Results for multi-task classification are given in Table 2 . They clearly evidence the increase in performance from the sequential architecture compared to all other strategies. Indeed, best results are achieved by this configuration in almost all cases. In particular, average improvements of 15.4% and 8.1% are attained when compared to the recent work of [1] i.e. FS Concat and its extended version including the cosine similarity measure, i.e. FS Concat + cos. Results also show that similar behaviors to binary classification can be observed. First, the introduction of the cosine similarity measure greatly boosts performance. Second, most of the information gain obtained by strategies without attention mechanisms comes from the SP matrix and not from the concatenation of the embeddings of the neighbors present in a given patch. Note that in this case, that Concat + SP is the best attention-unaware strategy, which achieves better results in terms of F 1 than Patches + SP + att 1 in 2 cases out of 8. Third, if we compare the sequential architecture to the current multi-task non-patch baseline, i.e. FS Concat + cos, similar differences in performance are obtained compared to the binary situation. In particular, an average improvement of 8% can be attained, with a minimum increase of 1.7% for RUMEN (hypernymy) and a maximum gain of 21.1% for BLESS (hypernymy). Finally, likewise the binary situation, the parallel architecture can not compete with the sequential counterpart and does not outperform the configuration with only within patch attention, i.e. Patches + SP + att 1 . When compared to the sequential binary classification model, the multi-task sequential counterpart based on the fully-shared architecture evidences best results in 5 cases out of 8. Nevertheless, overall improvements are small with an average increase in performance of 0.7%. Similarly, in the 3 other cases where the binary strategy offers best results, average gains of 0.4% are obtained. This can easily be explained by the small difference in architectures as already evidenced in [1] . Interestingly, the multi-task model evidences steady improvements in terms of Recall, with best values than the binary counterpart in 7 cases out of 8. In parallel, Precision shows worst results in 6 cases out of 8. This can also be explained by the fullyshared architecture that produces its decision based on a single shared layer, i.e. features that could be specific to one single task maybe lost. As a consequence, Precision may be affected while Recall boosted. In order to better understand the impact of K on the results, we show performance results for the binary and multi-task sequential architectures for K = 1..10 in Fig. 2 . Note that results in Table 2 are given for the best K on average and cannot account for differences in K between two semantic relations. Overall, we can notice different behaviors depending on the dataset. For RUMEN, performance values vary minimally with respect to K, independently of the semantic relation. For ROOT9 and BLESS, similar situations can be observed. Indeed, for both datasets, performance highly degrades with higher values of K for hypernymy, while the impact of K on co-hyponymy is more limited. For WEEDS, the situation is the opposite for hypernymy and co-hyponymy, as higher performance values are obtained for higher values of K. As a consequence, no clear conclusion can be drawn as results drastically change depending on the dataset. It is clear that further efforts are needed to propose better evaluation standards. Nevertheless, some regularities emerge. Indeed, over all values of K, the multi-task architecture evidences steady improvements over the binary counterpart for all datasets, except for ROOT9 where best results are obtained by the binary classification for both semantic relations. Also, in 2 cases out of 8, the best value of K is the same for the binary and the multi-task situations. In 3 cases, the difference in K value is one, and in the remaining 3 cases, the difference of K equals to 3, with 2 cases in which the multi-task architecture needs less neighbors than the binary version. This confirms the fact that small differences in terms of K values are evidenced on average between both strategies, although there seems to be a slight tendency to use less neighbors in the multi-task strategy.",
