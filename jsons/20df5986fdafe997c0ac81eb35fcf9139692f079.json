There are several investigations regarding the effects of nutrition supplementation on immune cells and inflammation in obesity condition (Chinchu, Mohan, & Prakash Kumar, 2020; Mousavi, Saboori, & Asbaghi, 2020; Tavvafian et al., 2020) . Previous studies have shown that physical activity can improve immune health via an increase in immune cells (Nieman & Wentz, 2019) . Therefore, it is suggested that the immune function should be increased by appropriate physical activity before the disease, which will boost the body against the virus. It is very useful in the present condition that there is no certain effective pharmaceutical agent against this virus (Fisher & Heymann, 2020) . Physical activities with different intensity have different effects on the immune system (Nieman & Wentz, 2019; Romeo, Warnberg, Pozo, & Marcos, 2010) . The present study reviews the studies about the effect of exercise intensity on inflammatory factors and immune cells in obesity condition (as indirect evidence against viruses).",

            "text": "Different physical activities in terms of intensity and type have different effects on immune system and inflammation (Nieman & Wentz, 2019; Romeo et al., 2010) . Several studies have shown that high intensity exercise has positive effect on inflammatory factors in obesity conditions (Khaleghzadeh, Afzalpour, Ahmadi, Nematy, & Sardar, 2020;  TaheriChadorneshin, Cheragh-Birjandi, Goodarzy, & Ahmadabadi, 2019). For example, Khaleghzadeh et al. showed that eight weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) led to a significant decrease in plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in male obese Wistar rats with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Khaleghzadeh et al., 2020) . Some studies compared the effects of high intensity and moderate intensity exercise on inflammatory factors. de Souza et al. showed that a single high intensity interval session is able to decrease interferon gamma-/interleukin-4 (IFN-\u03b3/IL-4) ratio (indicating an anti-inflammatory response), without alterations in the function of the mucosal immune system and lipoperoxidation. On the other hand, a session of moderateintensity continuous exercise induced changes in the pattern of cytokines associated with increased cellular immune function (de Souza et al., 2018) . Gerosa-Neto et al. showed that long-term HIIT (90% maximum heart rate, 3 times a week) increased TNF-\u03b1, while moderate-intensity continuous training (70% maximum heart rate, 5 times a week) decreased TNF-\u03b1 in overweight/obese adults (Gerosa-Neto et al., 2016) . In healthy young men, it was shown that moderate-intensity continuous training but not HIIT improved immune function biomarkers (Khammassi et al., 2020) . Another study showed that HIIT induced inflammatory response and suppressed immune functions (Zwetsloot, John, Lawrence, Battista, & Shanely, 2014) . The results of one review article showed that intense long exercise can lead to higher levels of inflammatory mediators, and consequently might increase the risk of injury and chronic inflammation, while moderate or vigorous exercise with appropriate resting periods can achieve maximum benefit (Cerqueira, Marinho, Neiva, & Louren\u00e7o, 2020) .",

The 'open window' theory is characterized by suppression of the immune system following high intensity exercise (Kakanis et al., 2010) . This window of opportunity may allow for an increase in susceptibility to upper respiratory illness (Kakanis et al., 2010) . 'J curve' concept explains that individuals that regularly perform moderate intensity exercise improve their immune system, excessive bouts of prolonged training can impair immune function ( Figure 2 ) (Campbell & Turner, 2018) . High intensity exercise due to the production of oxidants and suppression of immune system may be dangerous (especially, in obesity condition). The lipid peroxidation in obesity is higher than non-obesity condition (Marseglia et al., 2014) . These are some indirect evidence that make a conservative approach regarding the use of high intensity exercise in COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, COVID-19 disease may be asymptomatic in several days and hence, severe high-intensity exercise may be more dangerous.",
