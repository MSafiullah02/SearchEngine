Although it was thought that plant lectins were confined to seeds, evidence indicates that they are found all over the plant body, mainly in storage organs, such as tubers, rhizomes, bulbs, and roots. They are detected in minor amounts in other vegetal tissues (leaves, flowers, fruits, and phloem), however, they are not necessarily identical, in structure or carbohydrate binding specificity, to the lectins present in the storage organs (Ingale & Hivrale, 2013; Kennedy, Palva, Corella, Cavalcanti, & Coelho, 1995; Rudiger, 1998; Van Damme, 2008; Vasconcelos & Oliveira, 2004).",

Except for some enzymes, such as chitinase, glucanase, and glycosidase, lectins are unique plant proteins capable of recognizing and binding glycoconjugates on the outer surface of microorganisms and on the membranes of gastrointestinal insect and herbivore mammal cells, in order to protect plants against phytopathogens, phytophagous insects, and herbivores (Michiels, Van Damme, & Smagghe, 2010; Peumans & Van Damme, 1995a, 1995b; Peumans & Van Damme, 1996; Van Damme, 2008). Some plant lectin characteristics contribute to their insecticidal property, such as resistance to proteolysis and stability in a wide range of pH, enough to guarantee their passage through the gastrointestinal tract without degradation. Hence, these proteins would be free to bind glycoconjugates on the outer surface of epithelial cells from the gastrointestinal system, causing changes in cellular morphology, leading to impairment of stomach and intestinal metabolism and absorption process (Vasconcelos & Oliveira, 2004). The consumption of raw or partially cooked Phaseolus vulgaris by humans can cause foodborne illness, due to its high lectin content, which is inactivated by adequate cooking (Carlini & Grossi\u2010de\u2010Sa, 2002; Ohno, Naganuma, Ogawa, & Muramoto, 2006; Varki, 1993).",

Over the last century, studies revealed a very heterogeneous group of proteins with diverse specificities, primary sequences and structural features.

Taro originated from Asia, but was distributed in humid tropics and subtropics, where it can grow even in climate and soil conditions considered unfavorable to traditional agriculture (Heredia Z\u00e1rate, Vieira, & Silva, 1996; Lim, 2015; Mesquita, 2002). Currently, taro crops are widespread through Oceania, Central, and South America, Asia and Africa, the latter being the major producer (Alcantara, Hurtada, & Dizon, 2013). In Brazil, taro crops are more pronounced in the Central\u2010South region, with Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Esp\u00edrito Santo states leading the production (Mesquita, 2002). Genetic characterization and relationship studies among taro cultivars in Brazil have focused on the sequence analysis of exons of the plastid genes rbcL and matK loci and the pbsA\u2010trnH intergenic sequence used alone or in combination (Nunes, Del Aguila, Paschoalin, & da Silva, 2014). Polymorphisms among taro cultivars have been evaluated by using SSR (Simple sequence repeats) polymorphisms analysis in 7 loci (Xuqtem55, Xuqtem73, Xuqtem84, Xuqtem88, Xuqtem91, Xuqtem97, and Xuqtem110) (Nunes et al., 2012). Both microsatellite markers and matK locus and the noncoding sequence pbsA\u2010trnH contributed to establish the genetic diversity among taro cultivars grown in Brazil. The taro cultivar mostly consumed in Rio de Janeiro is the Chinese (Chin\u00eas or Chinezinho) variety (Nunes et al., 2012). A voucher specimen was deposited at the RFA Herbarium belonging to the Federal Univ. of Rio de Janeiro [Univ. Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)], Centro de Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade, Departamento de Bot\u00e2nica (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) under the designation RFA\u201039.962 (Pereira, Silva, Ver\u00edcimo, Paschoalin, & Teixeira, 2015).",

Poi can be allowed to reach a sour stage, where lactic acid and acetic acid accumulate, after the utilization of simple sugars by the microbial consortium. The nutritional composition of poi is quite similar to that of taro corms, but carbohydrate decreases and secondary metabolites comprise a probiotic food that could be used in medical nutrition therapy. During the early 1950s, poi was used in Hawaiian hospitals to successfully ameliorate infant food allergies and failure\u2010to\u2010thrive (Brown & Valiere, 2004). Studies on poi are scarce, but 1 study analyzed the effect of poi extracts in an in vitro assay concerning the proliferation of rat YYT colorectal cancer cells (Brown, Reitzenstein, Liu, & Jadus, 2005). Poi partially inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner, reaching maximum inhibition at 25%. Further studies revealed that poi extract induced cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and was also able to stimulate hematopoietic cells from normal mouse spleen, especially T cells.",

The aqueous extracts prepared from taro corms are mainly composed of four major proteins, classified as albumins (A1 and A2) and globulins (G1 and G2) (Carneiro et al., 1990; Hirai, Nakamura, Imai, & Sato, 1993; Monte\u2010Neshich et al., 1995). Globulins (G1 and G2) are the most abundant, accounting for 80% of total soluble proteins, and are well\u2010characterized in C. esculenta corms (Monte\u2010Neshich et al., 1995). On the other hand, little information is available about the identification of albumins or their biological properties. A1 Albumin is not always found in the aqueous extract, perhaps due to cultivar differences, extraction procedures or corm maturation stage (de Castro et al., 1992). The aqueous extract prepared by our research group did not show the presence of the A1 albumin in any of the two extraction procedures applied (Figure 1A and B) (Pereira et al., 2014, 2015). The A1 albumin has been purified and characterized, revealing that it accounts for 11% of total soluble proteins and that its expression decreases along corm development (Carneiro et al., 1990). This protein, termed colocasin, is composed of six 8.3 kDa homogeneous monomers, which are held together to form a 50 kDa hexamer with an isoelectric point (pI) ranging from 5.3 to 6.1. A2 albumin exhibits an apparent molecular mass of about 55 to 60 kDa,with pI varying from 5.5 to 6.0. This albumin accumulates in the first two stages of corm development, decreasing in the last 3 stages (de Castro et al., 1992).",

In the former group, one protomer generates 1 monomer with exclusive specificity towards mannose, while each two\u2010domain protomer releases two monomers with complex glycan specificity. Each monomer originally possesses up to 3 functional binding sites (subdomains I, II, and III), characterized by the consensus sequence QxDxNxVxY, which exclusively binds mannose/oligomannose, in single\u2010domain lectins, and more complex glycans, including high\u2010mannose and complex N\u2010glycans, in two\u2010domain lectins. The amino acid composition within carbohydrate binding sites for mannose/oligomannosides in single\u2010domain lectins is highly conserved. On the other hand, two\u2010domain lectins exhibit a less conserved amino acid composition in the subdomain regions. This group evolved from their single\u2010domain counterparts by inter\u2010domain sequence divergence, generating nonidentical subdomains with a wider and dual specificity towards more complex and longer glycan chains (Van Damme et al., 2007).",

            "text": "As a typical GNA\u2010related lectin, tarin monomers A and B assume the \u03b2\u2010prism II fold of three antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheets formed by 4 \u03b2\u2010strands each. Both monomers exhibit a hydrophobic core and a disulfide bond contributing to the \u03b2\u2010prism stability. Monomers A (11.9 kDa) and B (12.6 kDa) are held together as a heterodimer by a C\u2010terminal exchange. At the C\u2010terminal region, the fourth \u03b2\u2010strand in monomer A molds the \u03b2\u2010sheet in monomer B and vice\u2010versa, characterizing the C\u2010terminal exchanges and stabilizing the heterodimer 2 [A+B]. Four monomers (2 heterodimers or 2 [A+B]) oligomerize, giving rise to the tarin native structure, a stable 47 kDa heterotetramer capable of recovering or maintaining its functionality after being exposed to a wide range of pH, from 1 to 11, and high temperatures (Pereira et al., 2015, 2017; Vajravijayan, Pletnev, Pletnev, Nandhagopal, & Gunasekaran, 2016). Tarin exhibits one functional binding site per monomer and, consequently, a total of four binding sites in each tetramer. Since both binding sites (A and B) are not identical, tarin can bind a wide variety of ligands, including high\u2010mannose and complex N\u2010glycans, which are commonly found in animals. A closer analysis of tarin binding sites able to complexed to trimannose [Man\u03b1(1,3)Man\u03b1(1,6)Man] revealed that tarin can exhibit different affinities to the same ligand (Pereira et al., 2017). Moreover, the interaction with the ligand is not restricted to the conserved domain QxDxNxVxY shared by GNA lectins (Figure 4). Very close to the consensus sequence, comes a sequence of three (NGN) and five (GGKYG) amino acids in monomers A and B, respectively, which forms a loop that connects the \u03b2\u2010strands three and four of two \u03b2\u2010sheets (Figure 4). The loop sequence takes part in the trimannose interaction, particularly 1,6\u2010terminal mannose, creating an extended binding site area, allowing the protein to accommodate more complex and longer glycan chains (Pereira et al., 2017). In fact, tarin binds preferentially complex N\u2010glycans over high mannoses (Pereira et al., 2017). With a longer loop, monomer B allows a closer binding with the ligand, establishing a superior number of interactions with the trimannose compared to monomer A. A careful comparison of the loop sequence in tarin with the 10 \u03b2\u2010prism II lectins showed that these amino acids are limited by a conserved tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan (W), preserved in all the 11 lectins. The number and amino acid composition in the region between Y and W is highly variable, ranging from three to six amino acids, suggesting an important role of these residues on lectins\u2010fine specificity. The loop conformation also contributes to tarin specificity, since it assumes a flat conformation expanding the surface area contact, which is two amino acids longer in the monomer B. In classical mannose\u2010binding lectins like concanavalin A and the GNA family, the loop does not assume a flat conformation but it folds like a pocket, sandwiching the ligand and limiting their binding to less complex glycans with short chains, such as trimannose (Pereira et al., 2017).",

Tarin crystallized as a unique octamer due to the dimerization of monomers A from two tetramers, forming a circle of eight monomers into the asymmetric unit. Four hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges were found in the interface, which we believe to be a crystallographic artifact. Similarly, tarin structure bound to trimannose also oligomerizes as an octamer, but now, two octamers were found into the asymmetric unit. Although not relevant to the biological activity of tarin, the octamer formation contributes to trimannose binding to monomer A, sandwiching the ligand with the participation of amino acids from the adjacent monomer A and giving rise to a highly stable octamer organization (unpublished data).",

Tarin, when included in insect diets, can affect insect pupation and emergence and, when in high concentrations, can be lethal to several agricultural pests (Table 1).

Studies on tarin\u2010treated B. cucurbitae larvae have demonstrated that lectin was able to induce the insect detoxification system, by increasing esterase and phosphatase activities, as well as the anti\u2010oxidant defense system by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione\u2010S\u2010transferase (GST) activities(Thakur et al., 2013).",

The putative binding partners have been identified: ATP synthase, which is directly involved in the insect growth, loss of fecundity, development and midgut morphology. Another target for tarin was the cytochrome P450, involved in the detoxification of insecticide molecules causing failure in the insecticide resistance mechanism and making insects vulnerable when its activity decreases in the presence of lectin. Additional findings came from studies with Bemisia tabaci and Liphaphis erysimi where some specific tarin binding partners were confirmed and others were revealed in each species (Roy et al., 2014). In B. tabaci, tarin binds to ATP synthase and sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum type Ca2+ ATPase while in L. erysimi, tarin partners are the previously mentioned ATP synthase, but heat shock protein 70 and clathrin heavy chain assemble protein were also included, explaining insect growth and reproduction impairment and mortality enhancement.",

            "text": "Kundu et al. (2012) described the isolation of a protein, later identified as tarin, which was suggested to be the antimetastatic active principle of taro corm extracts. A murine cell breast cancer lineage 66.1, highly metastatic and easily able to colonize lung and heart tissue was used in that study. According to the aforementioned study, tarin exhibited a modest antiproliferative effect, being able to reduce up to 35% of the 66.1 cell lineage proliferation in vitro. On the other hand, when syngeneic BALB/cByJ mice were treated with tarin prior to and after the injection of 66.1 cells, lung colonization was significantly reduced and no heart colonization was observed. Studies on taro corm extract mechanisms indicated that the antimetastatic activity could be induced by the down\u2010regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)\u20101 and \u20102 and subsequent inhibition of prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) synthesis, which are associated to tumor aggressiveness (Kundu et al., 2012). COX inhibitors, especially COX\u20102 is highly expressed in certain pathological conditions and has been extensively used in clinical trials to treat breast, lung, prostate and colon cancer cells, since it is strongly associated to decreases in tumor proliferation, growth and migration and blockage of the inhibition of antitumoral responses as a result of the suppression of dendritic cells, natural killer cells and T cells by PGE2 (Liu, Qu, & Yan, 2015).",

Tarin specifically binds the high mannose N\u2010glycan 49 [Man\u03b11\u20103(Man\u03b11\u20106)Man\u03b21\u20104GlcNAc\u03b21\u20104GlcNAc\u03b2], which is commonly found in human cancer tissue but not in healthy ones (Zipser, Bello\u2010DeOcampo, Diestel, Tai, & Schmitz, 2012). Additionally, the complex N\u2010glycan 465 exhibits the terminal equivalent to the LeY antigen (Lewis Y/CD174 \u2010Fuc\u03b11\u20102Gal\u03b21\u20104[Fuc\u03b11\u20103]GlcNAc\u03b21\u2010), a cell marker specifically associated to cancer. The LeY antigen is up\u2010regulated in a variety of cancer cells derived from colon, stomach, ovary, breast, pancreas, prostate, and lung (Dube & Bertozzi, 2005). Although it was not proved to be an effect caused exclusively by tarin, taro corm extract exhibits partial antiproliferative activity against rat YYT colon cancer cells, breast cancer cells (MCF\u20107, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231, T47D, and MDA\u2010MB\u2010435) and prostate cancer cells (DU145, LNCaP, and PC3) (Brown et al., 2005; Kundu et al., 2012). Moreover, tarin is able to bind H2 antigen (CD173 \u2010 Fuc\u03b11\u20102Gal\u03b21\u20104GlcNAc\u03b21\u2010), present at the glycan 358 expressed in the leukemia cells lineages KG1 and KG1a (pro\u2010myeloid cells) and TF1 (pre\u2010erithroblastoid cells) (Cao et al., 2001). The CA\u2010125 antigen, which characterizes ovary cancer cells, is also a target for tarin binding (Wong et al., 2003). Taken together, these data are indicative of the possible broad spectrum of action of tarin anticancer effects. The aqueous extract from taro corms and the active principle, tarin, have been patented as a natural product for controlling cancer metastasis, to be administered in combination with chemotherapy (Fulton & Kundu, 2014).",

            "text": "Based on the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of tarin, we suggest a molecular model that unites its possible prophylactic and therapeutic actions on hematopoietic or cancer cells, which could boost murine responses (Figure 5). When administered to mice, tarin may act directly on hematopoietic progenitor cells (possibly CD34+) in the bone marrow, protecting them against immunosuppressant cytotoxicity. This protection could allow tarin\u2010treated immunosuppressed mice to maintain a higher pool of progenitor cells, which could aid mice in recovering faster from immunosuppression. The effects of tarin on the bone marrow may be reflected by increases in the number and activation of total peripheral leukocytes, especially neutrophils (Gr1+). Additionally, tarin inoculation in mice enhances the number of total B lymphocytes (B220+ cells) in the spleen, concomitantly with the decrease in the number of both mature (B220+IgM+) and immature (B220+IgM\u2212) B lymphocytes in the bone marrow. In this case, we suggest that the number of total B cells may be enhanced in the spleen as a result of direct tarin action on splenocytes, activating and stimulating their proliferation. Another alternative would be the migration of mature and immature B cells from the bone marrow to the spleen. Cytokine release (IL\u20102, IL1\u2010\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and INF\u2010\u03b3), which could stimulate innate or adaptive responses, may also be triggered by tarin inoculation in mice through leukocyte activation. All the effects observed in the bone marrow, peripheral cells and spleen, could be explained by the tarin ability to specifically bind to carbohydrates found on hematopoietic cell surfaces, including glycans 465 and 358. Cytokine release was reported only in vitro, while mature and immature B lymphocyte effects were reported in vivo following taro corm extract administration. Further studies are required to confirm in vivo cytokine release, to attribute the effects on B lymphocytes to tarin and to study the benefits they could bring to mice responses (Figure 5, left\u2010hand panel).",

Highly pure (>90%) and stable tarin samples (200 to 300 mg) can be obtained from 100 g of taro corms through a simple, low\u2010cost and single\u2010step purification procedure. Many of the traditional uses of taro as a medicinal plant have been scientifically corroborated. Tarin applications for pest management using plant engineering techniques, as well as a functional additive in food should be considered. Similar to the members of the GNA\u2010related family, tarin is a noteworthy molecule due to its promising antiviral, antitumoral and insecticidal activities and potential as an immunomodulator molecule. Natural or manufactured food fortified by tarin could contribute to health maintenance and human well\u2010being. Tarin activity can be explored as a putative immunomodulatory by bringing new evidence regarding potential boosting of the immunological system in order to partially reverse immunosuppressive effects. Immunosupressive states may take advantage of tarin effects on hematopoietic and progenitor cells. Tarin may also be part of future cancer therapeutics, since it may interact directly with cancer cells to inhibit tumor proliferation and the migration of malignant cells. Tarin, in its purified form described herein, could be a promising adjuvant in chemotherapeutic treatment if animal and clinical trials support its effectiveness with no serious side effects to human cells associated with the protein preparation.",
