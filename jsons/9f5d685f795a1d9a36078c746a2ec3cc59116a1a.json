Or it is possible that these three elements were combined to create a synergistic effect.",

The first thing you can think of is destroying the body of the virus. However, destroying the virus itself is a concept of disinfection and is too dangerous for humans to apply. As a therapeutic agent, there are drugs that inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by inhibiting the replication of viruses (e.g., remdesivir), or drugs that inhibit protease (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir). 1,13 Another target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a gatekeeper and receptor for viruses to enter human cells. By raising the intracellular pH, glycosylation of ACE2 can be prevented to block the entry of the virus (e.g., chloroquine), 13,14 or it can be prevented from binding to ACE2 in advance by sticking to the spike protein of the virus. 15, 16 The latter, not the former, is the antibody.",

Blocking a virus with antibodies is not enough to win the battle. We must also suppress the replication of the virus, and prepare for a cytokine storm that occurs during treatment. 17 In conclusion, it makes no sense as to which of these treatment methods was a decisive factor in the successful treatment. Rather, it is necessary to combine all of these to engage in treatment.",
