Chronic pulmonary complications, such as bronchiectasia, have been frequently reported in children with AV disease of lower airways (3,4). Acute otitis media (AOM) is also frequently associated with AV infection (1, 2, 5).

CRP, which has been used as an unspecific means to differentiate viral and bacterial infections (6, 7) , was equally often elevated regardless of the presence of bacterial coinfection or an infection focus, AOM or pneumonia. CRP values over 40 mg/l, a screening limit considered to indicate bacterial infection, have been frequently found in AV infections in which the presence of concomitant bacterial involvement has not been studied (7) . H . influenzue was the organism most often associated with AV infection (20), in contrast to the findings in our earlier studies which have shown that PNC is the most common bacterial finding in RSV and PV infections (14, 15). Two-thirds of the patients with H. influenzae involvement had pneumonia, and a half had AOM. PNC involvement was only seen in association with pneumonia. Both pneumonia and AOM were also seen without serological evidence of bacterial infection, which argues for the less than ideal sensitivity of the serological methods used.",

Bacterial coinfection therefore seems to be common in AV infection of the lower airways, just as in similar infections caused by RSV or PV (14,  15) . Bacterial coinfection may be partly responsible for the later pulmonary complications associated with AV infection of the lower airways (3,4) . The data,presented show that the establishment of a viral aetiology does not exclude bacterial involvement. We conclude that bacterial infection should be actively looked for and antibiotic treatment considered in children with AV infection affecting the lower airways.",
