This study, to our knowledge is the largest case series to date of confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Besides, this is the first study focus on the 2019-nCoV outside Wuhan. We found that the majority of patients were middle-aged men. This result is consistent with the research of Zhong NS in Wuhan [6] . They found that the median age of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 47.0 years, and 58.1% were males. We also consistent with the study of Huang C. who also concluded that the majority of infected patients were men (73%) [7] . We further divided patients with NCP into With Wuhan exposure group and without Wuhan exposure group. We founded that patients without Wuhan explore history were older than those with Wuhan explore history, and the difference was statistically significant. This may be due to the fact that most of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection in Shaanxi are imported cases, and most of them are migrant workers in Hubei and returned hometown during the Spring Festival. In addition, older people are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV. Furthermore, the day from onset to diagnosis for patients with Wuhan exposure history is longer than that without Wuhan. This is easy to understand, because most of the patients without Wuhan exposure are infected by imported patients. Wuhan exposure group was further divided into long-term exposure group and short-term exposure group. The conclusion were that the male Ma.X. made substantial contribution to analysis and interpretation of the work;",

            "text": ",2019, a new coronavirus named 2019-nCoV causing severe acute respiratory disease has emerged in the region of Wuhan, China[1,2]. The National Health Commission of People's Republic of China named pneumonia infected with 2019-nCoV as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP).Evidence have pointing to the person-to-person transmission[3-5]. As of February 8, 2020, China has reported 34,673 confirmed and more than 27,657 suspected cases of NCP across 34 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 106 fatalities. Most of the studies focused on the epidemic situation in Wuhan, but few on provinces outside Wuhan. Shaanxi is located in the northwest of Hubei Province and adjacent to it, with a population of 38.64 million. Since the first case of NCP was confirmed in Shannxi by on January 23,2020, 195 cases have been confirmed, but there is no relevant epidemiological study. In order to better understand the epidemic law of new coronavirus in Shaanxi Province, and provide the basis for the future development of control measures.This article aims to report the epidemiological outcomes of 195 confirmed case infected with 2019-nCoV in Shaanxi, and to compare the clinical features between patients with or without a history of exposure in Wuhan. We reviewed the epidemiological characteristics and outcome date of 195 laboratory confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection reported by the Health Commission of Shaanxi Province.
