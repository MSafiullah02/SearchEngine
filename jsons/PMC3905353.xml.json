HSV-1 initially replicates in mucoepithelial cells, causes disease at the site of infection, and then establishes latent infection of the innervating neurons. The most common infections of the virus include gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis.[1] Following latency establishment, HSV-1 causes recurrent infections, most commonly herpetic labialis. Herpetic keratitis leads to permanent scaring, corneal damage, and blindness. HSV-1 also causes encephalitis leading to destruction of the temporal lobe, seizure, and focal neurologic abnormalities.[2]",

In addition, the emergence of virus strains resistant to commonly used anti-herpes virus drugs is of importance, particularly in immunocompromised patients.[5] Thus, new antiviral agents exhibiting different mechanisms of action are urgently needed.[6] Medicinal plants have been used for many years for the treatment of human diseases and a number of herbal medicines have been developed into therapeutic agents. In Iran, there are a large number of different medicinal plants, such as Quercus persica with antimicrobial activities.[7]",
