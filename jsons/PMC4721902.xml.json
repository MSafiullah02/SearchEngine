Asymptomatic adults attending outpatient primary care clinics for routine health maintenance were enrolled at Vanderbilt University (Nashville). Eligibility requirements for controls included (1) absence of fever, cough, sore throat, wheeze, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, ear pain, and vomiting for the past 14 days; and (2) residence in a geographic catchment area surrounding each enrolling center. Children undergoing otolaryngologic surgery were excluded. To avoid inclusion of controls in the incubation period of an existing infection, we excluded patients in whom respiratory symptoms developed within 14 days after enrollment, as determined by a follow-up telephone call [16]. Asymptomatic controls were enrolled during the following time periods: children in Salt Lake City, February 2011 through June 2012; children in Nashville, March 2011 through June 2012; and adults in Nashville, November 2011 through June 2012.",

Ct values were also used to construct nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to discriminate between asymptomatic controls and patients with CAP. The area under the curve for each ROC curve was calculated. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated at Ct value cut points that maximized combined sensitivity and specificity [32].

Combined, these findings of rare hRV detection in upper respiratory specimens of asymptomatic adults and detection of hRV in lower respiratory specimens of intubated adults with CAP suggest that when hRV is detected from upper respiratory swab samples in adults with CAP, it may have an etiologic role. A higher prevalence of asymptomatic hRV detection in children makes it more difficult to interpret a positive rRT-PCR test for hRV from an upper respiratory specimen in children than adults.

Age stratification and multivariable regression adjustment were used to account for potential confounders. Furthermore, results were presented as AFs, which helps with clinical interpretation. Limitations include pediatric enrollment during only 1 full respiratory season and adult enrollment at only 1 site and for 8 months owing to resource constraints. Inclusion of only 1 respiratory season prevented exploration of how seasonal variation in viral circulation may have affected AFs from year to year. Small numbers of viral detections in adult controls prevented further age stratification. In addition, asymptomatic controls were enrolled as a convenience sample and were not matched with case patients. Although some studies have reported persistent viral detections weeks after acute exacerbations of certain comorbid conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma [41], matching controls to patients with CAP according to the presence of comorbid medical conditions and timing of related exacerbations was found to be impractical and would have severely hampered our enrollment efforts. Although 13% of enrolled subjects were excluded because we could not contact them to ascertain whether they developed respiratory symptoms after enrollment, those excluded were similar to subjects with completed follow-up (Supplementary Table 1). Enrollment of community controls who did not present to a healthcare facility would have provided another comparison group [16] but was not logistically feasible.",

Therefore, it is essential to consider background rates of asymptomatic viral detection when assessing the etiologic contribution of viruses to CAP, especially in children, who had more asymptomatic detections than adults. In our study, influenza, RSV, and hMPV were very rarely detected in asymptomatic persons of all ages compared with patients with CAP, suggesting that when they are detected in patients with CAP, these viruses were associated with disease. Additional research, including evaluation of lower respiratory tract specimens, is needed to further delineate the contribution to CAP of other respiratory viruses, including hRV, AdV, PIV, and CoV.",
