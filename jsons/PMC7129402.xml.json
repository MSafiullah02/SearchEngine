The ethical basis of RCTs relies on the principle of clinical equipoise (ie, no genuine evidence exists that an experimental treatment is better than the standard of care) and individual uncertainty (ie, clinical investigators and enrolled patients are substantially uncertain about the merits of the experimental treatment). By providing a virtually unbiased comparator, RCTs guarantee, at best, robustness of results about both the efficacy and safety of investigational drugs. Thus, since the inception of RCTs, researchers have acknowledged that until an intervention has been proven beneficial, randomisation is the most ethical approach and provides the best answer soonest.7, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 The idea that RCTs are ethically unjustified in the present Ebola outbreak might be based on several widespread misconceptions.",

However, if effectiveness is only slight, external comparators (both concurrent or historical) in observational series or non-comparative studies could be severely biased because of high and undocumented patient heterogeneity and will probably differ systematically between patients who received treatment and patients who did not. By contrast, interim analyses in RCTs can, at best, inform clinical investigators on whether to proceed with the same randomised allocation, either shifting all patients to an intervention group with an effective treatment or stopping the treatment with a potentially unsafe drug.7 The focus of an interim analysis is to respond rapidly to high quality data emerging from an RCT, rather than in an RCT without an interim analysis wherein researchers blindly treat and hope for a positive outcome.",

Moreover clinical centres should be able to implement infection control measures in advance to prevent health-care associated transmission of infection. The sponsors of such studies should provide the clinical facilities and adequate resources to ensure that the standard supportive care meets minimum requirements of good clinical practice. The rigorous implementation and monitoring of interventions that are agreed by consensus as being practicable in the context of local care, would help to set minimum ethically acceptable practices for treatment and infection control. By contrast, the deregulated scenario, where any new drugs with unproven efficacy can be used, provides no such guarantee.

With such an extraordinary efficacy no RCT will go beyond the second interim analysis (see figure 2B). Moreover, if a priori hypotheses are confirmed the chance that a significant effect will be reported at the second interim analysis is still about 50% (see figure 2B). As the likelihood of the study cessation is positively associated with the mortality in the control group, very few patients (in absolute terms) who did not receive such an extraordinary intervention will actually die. In view of the availability of a reliable comparator, interim analyses in RCTs are much stronger than analyses in non-comparative studies to inform investigators about any unexpected toxic effects of the investigational drug.",

At present JIKI is the most ambitious trial in progress and since the start of enrolment, on Dec 17, 2014, the investigators have enrolled 80 participants after just 36 days. The main results presented were that mortality was positively associated with Ebola viral load; that favipiravir was generally well tolerated; and that a non-significant trend for reduced mortality was reported in those with the lowest Ebola viral load who received the drug by comparison with historical controls, whereas an opposite trend was reported in those with the highest Ebola viral load who received the drug.",

These results leave ethical uncertainty for the researchers about whether to continue the study as it is, change the enrolment according to baseline viral load, or to interrupt the study and divert resources for tests of new experimental drugs. Should the JIKI trial have been designed within an adaptive framework, the maximum sample size would have been reduced (210 vs 225) and, having gone through an adaptation iteration, the researchers would have been able to discuss truly comparative evidence for this kind of treatment by the time 80 patients had been assessed.",

This restricted suitability implies that adaptive RCTs might be unable to assess long-term outcomes. Third, results of interim analyses might influence decisions of the data and safety monitoring boards, researchers, and study participants. Finally, adaptive designs usually include multiple interim analyses, which often leads to an inflated type-I error; as such the adaptive framework should be kept as simple as possible.35 However, a prudent adaptive design including a small number of clinical centres, a restricted number of interim analyses, and a well understood and validated adaptive framework could easily address all these issues.37, 38\n",
