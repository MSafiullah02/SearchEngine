Therefore, the first step in management of a HSCT patient with acute hypoxia and/or hypercarbia is to perform a thorough workup to confirm or rule out infectious etiologies (Table 11.1). These children are at high risk of death if their infection is not identified early and treated and their immune dysregulation appropriately addressed. Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections are all considerations in posttransplant patients given their immunosuppression and presence of indwelling catheters and invasive lines. Identification of specific organism can help clinicians target antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately, broad-spectrum empiric treatment is often prolonged due to delays in turnaround times and insensitivity of microbiological testing.",

However, it is prudent to consider the risk-benefit ratio and optimal timing of the BAL due to the potential for worsening lung mechanics. Triebwasser et al. in 2018 in a retrospective chart review of 593 patients of different age groups that underwent a BAL reported identification of pathogens in 30% of cases [15]. They reported that the BAL led to changes in patient management in 55% of cases, including alteration in antibiotics (37%) and immunosuppression (25%). BAL complications included hypoxemia (1%), hemorrhage (2%), and respiratory failure (1%) in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation prior to the BAL. This would suggest that an early BAL would be safe and may alter the treatment plan in more than half of cases. Prophylaxis and preemptive screening for invasive fungal and CMV infections have resulted in a decrease in their incidence posttransplant [3]. Improved molecular diagnostic techniques will likely result in improved testing yield and decreased need for\nprolonged empiric therapy.",

            "text": "Once infection is ruled out, children with lung injury are then categorized as either acute idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), engraftment syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or other lung injury syndromes. In 1993 a National Institutes of Health workshop defined IPS as widespread alveolar injury in the absence of active lower respiratory infection, cardiogenic causes, renal failure, or iatrogenic fluid overload after HSCT [3, 16]. This definition was further classified based on anatomy as interstitial, vascular, airway tissue, or unclassifiable [3, 14]. T-cell-mediated injury is supported as the primary pathophysiology by murine models. TNF-\u03b1 levels have been shown to be increased in the BAL fluid of mice with IPS. This is supported by the clinical observation that patients who receive T-cell-depleted grafts have a lower incidence of pulmonary complications [13]. However other TNF- \u03b1-independent pathways may also contribute to the pathophysiology of IPS [3]. Given the TNF-\u03b1 pathway-mediated injury, the soluble TNF-\u03b1-binding protein, etanercept, has been tested in a trial for treatment of IPS [17]. Early recognition of the disorder, ruling out other infectious etiologies, and initiation of corticosteroids along with other anti-inflammatory targeted therapies may improve outcomes after IPS [3].",

High-dose corticosteroids were reported to not alter the outcomes in these patients in a prospective cohort study of 103 adult HSCT patients [3, 20].

Wanko et al. reported a decrease in 100-day mortality (44% versus 83%) in a small group of eight adult patients with DAH, treated with concomitant aminocaproic acid and steroids [22].

Both BOS and COP are related to T-cell-mediated injury to lung epithelial cells, and Initial therapy is usually high-dose corticosteroids burst with a prolonged taper over months [3, 13]. Other therapies such as azithromycin, cyclosporine, and etanercept have been described and need further evaluation [3, 13]. A recent trial of inhaled fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast in patients with new-onset bronchiolitis obliterans showed that the combination therapy had improvement in ability to stabilize disease progression when compared to historical controls [35].",

These modalities can assist in oxygenation and ventilation in patients with respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure while potentially avoiding the complications of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) [37]. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) maintains positive pressure and prevents airway and alveolar collapse in patients who are spontaneously breathing [38]. BiPAP is triggered by the patient\u2019s breath and an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) is provided while preventing airway and alveolar collapse with expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) [36\u201338]. A respiratory rate is also set on BiPAP, which can sometimes lead to dysynchrony between the mandatory breaths and the patient\u2019s innate respiratory efforts.",

Literature reports a NIV success rate in immunocompromised pediatric patients of 54.5% with diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and up to 74.2% with diagnosis of respiratory failure [37, 47]. Among all patients with acute respiratory failure who received NIV, FiO2 > 80% 1 h after initiation predicted failure of NIV [48]. Within pediatric immunocompromised patients, those who failed NIV were more likely to have severe sepsis and septic shock than those in the success group [47]. Patients in the NIV success group had early and sustained improvement compared to those who failed; therefore, lack of early improvement is discussed with the threshold of improvement being between 1 h and 2\u20134 h [47\u201350]. Munoz-Bonet et al. determined that an improvement in respiratory rate and pCO2 2\u20134 h after NIV was associated with NIV success. Patients who had improvement of their PaO2/FiO2 ratio within the first hour of NIV initiation also were more likely to be in the NIV success group [49]. Therefore, a lack of improvement in physiologic parameters, such as weaning FiO2 or decreasing respiratory rate, within 2\u20134 h of NIV initiation should be considered an indication for endotracheal intubation (Fig. 11.1) [36]. Additionally, it appears prudent to consider patients with escalating hemodynamic support to have failed NIV trial.",

The reason for intubation such as elective for a procedure or emergent due to lung failure and the degree of lung injury is important to consider. Given the high mortality, it is important to urgently rediscuss goals of care and code status for patients with irreversible underlying disease and a few months or less to live, where it may prolong suffering. In a multicenter retrospective cohort study between 2009 and 2014 of 242 HSCT patients, the PICU mortality was noted to be 60.4%. Patients ventilated longer than 15 days had 2.4 times higher odds of death, and 40% of patients were placed on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) with a higher mortality of 76.5%. Transition to HFOV within 2 days of start of invasive mechanical ventilation resulted in a 76% decrease in the odds of death compared to those who were transitioned later [52]. The study suggests that early and aggressive lung protective ventilation strategies may result in improved outcomes in these patients.",

Permissive hypercapnia and hypoxia while ensuring adequate end-organ oxygen delivery would help achieve these goals in these patients. Severity of lung injury in intubated patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure can be estimated using OI and OSI [10]. OI has shown to also be a predictor of mortality [54\u201356].

Thereby, if one is not able to achieve lung recruitment without utilization of high ventilation strategies, one should consider escalation to other nonconventional modalities that are considered lung protective [10]. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is another modality that has been used by some centers. Rowan et al. in a retrospective multicenter database study reported on 85 pediatric HSCT patients with severe PARDS managed with HFOV. The study suggested that in that cohort, early use of HFOV was associated with improved survival compared to late implementation of HFOV, and the subjects had outcomes similar to those treated only with conventional mechanical ventilation [57]. There continues to be a need for more outcome data with HFOV and APRV use in pediatric patients with respiratory failure. Yehya et al. in a cohort of pediatric patients, refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation requiring transition to HFOV or APRV, demonstrated that HFOV was associated with more frequent neuromuscular blockade with no difference in mortality [56]. Perhaps more important is to observe the improvement in OI at 6\u201324 h after transition to HFOV and APRV which has been associated with survival, likely reflecting severity of lung disease and/or the ability to re-recruit the lungs [54, 56, 58]. In conclusion, lung protective ventilation should be implemented early in this cohort of children given the high risk of mortality and morbidity.",

Establishing set criteria for ECMO cannulation in this population is challenging given their immunocompromised status, thrombocytopenia, unique/varying range of pathologies, and multi-organ dysfunction. Gow et al. in 2006 reported a 21% survival rate to decannulation in a small cohort of 19 pediatric HSCT patients [60].

Tight fluid management is imperative along with initiation of diuretics in many patients. Clinical orders to limit total fluids at maintenance, to concentrate all medications and infusions, and to evaluate the need for medications that have a high volume of fluid should be done early to avoid worsening fluid overload. Acute renal failure is not an uncommon complication in posttransplant patients, and it makes fluid management extremely challenging. Fluid overload associated with acute renal failure leads to worsening respiratory function, prolonged ventilation, increased ICU stay, and mortality [61\u201366]. Early consultation of renal specialists and intervention with diuretics and advanced therapies for fluid removal is imperative. In a retrospective chart review of 113 critically ill pediatric patients receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, median fluid overload percentage was significantly lower in survivors versus non-survivors (7.8% vs. 15.1%) [65]. Michael et al. reviewed 26 HSCT patients with acute renal failure and noted a fluid overload of <10% was associated with improved survival [66]. Ellbahlawan et al. demonstrated a significant improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in HSCT patients after initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy, which significantly correlated, with reduction of fluid balance [67]. Initiation of CRRT for treatment of fluid overload may improve oxygenation and survival [3].",

Evaluation of a HSCT patient with acute hypoxia and/or hypercarbia requires a workup to confirm or rule out infectious etiologies prior to treatment for potential noninfectious causes. Utilization of NIV requires constant monitoring of the patient to ensure improvement. The lack of physiological improvement on NIV should be considered an indication for endotracheal intubation. Early and aggressive lung protective ventilation strategies upon intubation with close monitoring for fluid overload may result in improved outcomes in these patients. Further research is required to look at other modifiable clinical factors/management techniques and to assess outcomes after the use of NIV, IMV, and ECMO in this unique population.",
