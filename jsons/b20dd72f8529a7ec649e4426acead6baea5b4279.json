Edible vaccines are subunit vaccines where the selected genes are introduced into the plants and the transgenic plant is then induced to manufacture the encoded protein. Foods under such application include potato, banana, lettuce, corn, soybean, rice, and legumes. They are easy to administer, easy to store and readily acceptable delivery system for different age group patients yet cost effective. Edible vaccines present exciting possibilities for significantly reducing various diseases such as measles, hepatitis B, cholera, diarrhea, etc., mainly in developing countries. However, various technical and regulatory challenges need to overcome in the path of this emerging vaccine technology to make edible vaccine more efficient and applicable.

Dead or attenuated organisms or purified products derived from them are generally used to produce various vaccines. Over the past decade, scientific advances in genetics, molecular biology, and plant biotechnology have improved the understanding of many infectious diseases and led to the development of vaccination programs. The most common method of administering vaccines is by injection but some are given by mouth or nasal spray. Though immunization is the safest method to combat the diseases worldwide but there are many constraints regarding its mode of production, distribution, delivery, cost, and lack of enough research. Hence it is desirable to look for an effectual and powerful yet cost effective, easy for storage and distribution yet safe method of immunization. It should also be readily acceptable to all sociocultural groups around the globe. Research underway is dedicated to solving these problems by finding ways to produce edible vaccines in the form of transgenic plants which have been investigated as an alternative means to produce and deliver vaccine.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Edible vaccines are called by several alternative names such as food vaccines, oral vaccines, subunit vaccines, and green vaccines.

The concept of edible vaccines lies in converting the edible food into potential vaccines to prevent infectious diseases. It involves introduction of selected desired genes into plants and then inducing these altered plants to manufacture the encoded proteins. It has also found application in prevention of autoimmune diseases, birth control, cancer therapy, etc. Edible vaccines are currently being developed for a number of human and animal diseases.

It was these needs which inspired Hiatt et al. (1989) who attempted to produce antibodies in plants which could serve the purpose of passive immunization. The first report of edible vaccine (a surface protein from Streptococcus) in tobacco, at 0.02 % of total leaf protein level, appeared in 1990 in the form of a patent application published under the international patent cooperation treaty. By conceiving the idea of edible vaccine Dr. Charles Arntzen tried to realize it (Arntzen 1997) . In 1992, Arntzen and coworkers introduced the concept of transgenic plants as a production and delivery system for subunit vaccines in which edible tissues of transgenic crop plants were used (Mor et al. 1998) . They found that this concept could overcome the limitations of traditional vaccines, thereby triggering the research on edible vaccine. In 1990s, Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen A was expressed for the first time in tobacco. The same group also pioneered the field with work on hepatitis B and heatlabile toxin, B subunit in tobacco plants and potato tubers. In the same year, the successful expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in tobacco plants was also achieved (Mason et al. 1992) .

Transgenic tobacco is successfully engineered for the production of edible vaccines against hepatitis B antigen using 's' gene of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The optimum level of recombinant protein was obtained in leaves and seeds. Since acute watery diarrhea is caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli and Vibrio cholerae that colonize the small intestine and produce one or more enterotoxin, an attempt was made toward the production of edible vaccine by expressing heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-B) in tobacco. Besides, antibodies against dental caries, expressed in tobacco, are already in preclinical human trials.

Like, one could develop immunotolerance to the vaccine peptide or protein, though a little research has been done on it. One of the key goals of the edible-vaccine pioneers was to reduce immunization costs but later many limitations were reported as given below: 1. Consistency of dosage from fruit to fruit, plant to plant, lot to lot, and generation to generation is not similar. 2. Stability of vaccine in fruit is not known. 3. Evaluation of dosage requirement is tedious. 4. Selection of best plant is difficult. 5. Certain foods like potatoes are generally not eaten raw and cooking the food might weaken the medicine present in it. 6. Not convenient for infants as they might spit it, eat a part or eat it all, and throw it up later. Concentrating the vaccine into a teaspoon of baby food may be more practical than administering it in a whole fruit. 7. There is always possibility of sideeffects due to the interaction between the vaccine and the vehicle. 8. People could ingest too much of the vaccine, which could be toxic, or too little, which could lead to disease outbreaks among populations believed to be immune. 9. A concern with oral vaccines is the degradation of protein components in the stomach due to low pH and gastric enzymes. However, the degradation can be compensated by repeating the exposure of the antigen until immunological tolerance is accomplished (Mason et al. 2002) . 10. Potential risk of spreading the disease by edible vaccine delivery is a concern of many. Potential contamination of the oral delivery system is a possible danger. Foreign proteins in plants accumulate in low amounts (0.01-2 % of total protein) and are less immunogenic, therefore the oral dose far exceeds the intranasal/parenteral dose. For example oral hepatitis B dose is 10-100 times the parenteral dose and 100 g potato expressing B subunit of labile toxin of ETEC (LT-B) is required in three different doses to be immunogenic.

The stable expression strategy provides an opportunity to introduce more than one gene for possible multicomponent vaccine production. Furthermore, the choice of genetic regulatory elements allows organ and tissue-specific expression of foreign antigens. Stable transformation causes the desired gene to be incorporated either in nucleus or chloroplast. Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer is used for transforming the plants in which the gene is integrated in nucleus. Besides, direct delivery of DNA into the tissue can also be applied, biolistic being the most popular method. However, chloroplast engineering has also got impetus in last decade due to its various advantages over nuclear engineering. gram-negative soil bacterium, which infects the wound sites in dicot plants causing the formation of the crown gall tumor. This bacterium is capable of transferring a particular DNA segment (T-DNA) of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid into the nucleus of infected cells where it is subsequently integrated into the host genome and transcribed. The T-DNA usually contains cancer-causing oncogenic genes and genes that synthesize opines which are excreted by infected crown gall cells and are a food source for bacterium. During the genetic manipulation, the Ti plasmid is engineered to carry the desired gene for vaccine and the virulent genes that cause tumor growth in plants are deleted. The transgene is integrated, expressed, and inherited in mendelian fashion. The whole plant can be then regenerated from individual transformed plant cell. It has been studied that genes are successfully expressed in experimental model plants and when given orally to animals, the extract of transgenic plant containing the antigen induced serum antibodies, thus can be used to produce the edible vaccine.

The antigens thus released are taken up by M cells in the intestinal lining that are present over the Peyer's patches (PP) in the ileum and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. PP are an enriched source of IgA producing plasma cells and populate mucosal tissue and serves as mucosal immune effectors sites. The breakdown of edible vaccine occurs near PP, consisting of 30-40 lymphoid nodules on the outer surface of the intestine and contain follicles from which germinal center develops upon antigenic stimulation. These follicles act as the sites from which antigen penetrates the intestinal epithelium, thereby accumulating antigen within organized lymphoid structure. The antigens then come in contact with M cells which in turn express class II MHC molecules. Antigens transported across the mucous membrane by M cells can activate B-cells within these lymphoid follicles. The activated B-cells leave the lymphoid follicles and migrate to diffuse mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) where they differentiate into plasma cells that secrete the IgA class of antibodies. These IgA antibodies are transported across the epithelial cells into secretions of the lumen where they can interact with antigens present in the lumen and immediately neutralize the infectious agent.
