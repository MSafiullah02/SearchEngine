            "text": "The gram positive bacillus bacteria, Nocardia asteroides causing nocardiosis targeting to immunocompromised patients in direct state (Wilson 2012). A total of 225 species have been estimated till now under the genera of Nocardia (Bennett et al. 2014). It is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for several diseases in human as well as other vertebrate animal (Moylett et al. 2003). Practically these bacteria serve as predominant causing factors for pulmonary infection. Consequently it shows acute necrotizing pneumonia that also reflects in the inflammation of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. While the brain is recognized as most favored site for secondary infection in 25% patients amongst all victims (Ellis and Beaman 2002; Quinones-Hinojosa 2012). Subsequently N. asteroides is the prime cause of serious cerebral abscess as reported by researcher (Fleetwood et al. 2000). Nocardiosis is distributed worldwide but it is most prevalence through the United States (Patil et al. 2012; Saubolle and Sussland 2003). Infection of nocardiasis is influences by the sex and age of the patient. As noted the male female patient ratio 3:1 reflects that men are prone to nocardiasis rather than the female. Recently, around 0.375 nocardia infection for every 100 000 individuals have been reported throughout the world (Palmieri et al. 2014). Exclusively 500-1000 individuals are affected in United States every year in a random mode (Sethy et al. 2016). Numerous endeavors are taken to overcome the fatal disease but till now the disease is prevalence as research data reported. The Nocardiosis disease is predominant to the alcoholic, diabetic, cancer, AIDS and organ transplanted patient so, its need immediate control and monitoring supports. In present scenario records of these patients are quiet in frequent numbers. Therefore, this disease already occupied great concern and requires immediate remedy by promising, cost effective ways. Vaccination against the disease will be the finest and reliable option for controlling the disease outbreak (Nichol et al. 2003). A vaccine would have more effective if it can elicit both B and T-cell dependent immune responses. Vaccine designing against any disease can be performed using two specific approaches, conventional approach and reverse vaccinological approach. Within the present research plan the reverse vaccinological approach has been applied to design epitopic vaccine against N. asteroides as the conventional technique has some limitations. The conventional technique requires much time and also very expensive to formulate. Furthermore, the technique applied to killed, attenuated or indolent pathogens for vaccine development which will prove deadly if the pathogen alters to its pathogenic appearance (Khan et al. 2015). Besides from such conventional approach, the reverse vaccinology harnesses the immunoinformatics for developing vaccine against pathogenic diseases (Vivona et al. 2008). The advance approach involves several web portals and computational tools to predict the potential vaccine candidate. The fundamentality of reverse vaccinology showing it targets of protein derived epitopic sequence for novel vaccine generation. The reverse vaccinology provides easy and reliable techniques to find out the accurate B and T-cell epitopes (Srivastava et al. 2019). While the exomembrane and secreted protein of pathogens are the ideal for vaccine generation as these can easily interact with immune system (Gourlay et al. 2013). Considering the bacterial proteins are foreign to host body, it will be further recognized as antigenic determinants. Expression of both B and T-cell epitopes will enhance the immunogenicity driven by B and T-cell proliferation. The virulence factor of Mce family protein found to be responsible for the virulency of N. asteroides and pathogenicity expression. The current research focuses on the computational analysis and identification of potential epitopes present within the bacterial Mce family protein candidate. Therefore, identified epitopes will be served as ideal component for future vaccine development against the infection of N. asteroides. In order to execute the subsequent research performance the supreme computational aided techniques has been employed. Consequently the targeted protein sequence has been crucially analyzed through several authentic web prediction portals focus to extract the functional epitopes leading to narrative vaccine generation against Nocardiosis disease.",

            "text": "Rational identification, authentication and in sillico analysis of epitopic components facilitates the successful generation of novel vaccines. As noted the vaccine element performs a key role not only recovering from the infections but also controlling the future disease outbreak. Hence, the nocardiosis has carried a dreadful influence over the immunocompromised patient as they manifest high level of disease susceptibility. Particularly the organ transplant patients encounter the greater chances of nocardiosis. The casualty of organ recipient patients for nocardia infection often reflects in higher degree (Husain et al. 2002). Consequently, the causing pathogen also highly resistance to several well known, market available antibiotics (Husain et al. 2002). Greater survivability, infections and antibiotic resistance nature of the bacterial pathogen is one of the greatest apprehensions for medical biotechnologist. Present advanced, computational analysis assisted research emphasizes much on the discovery of effective vaccine against to N. asteroides. The virulence factor Mce family protein of N. asteroides is responsible for the pathogenesis of the bacteria to other organism. Hence this protein served as the supreme component for designing epitopic vaccine against nocardiosis. The virulence factor Mce family protein is processed through several bioinformatic tools to execute the suitable epitopes having antigenicity. The transmembrane localization of the protein permits it to intermingle with exact immune system. The transmembrane helix prediction server TMHMM server (ver. 2.0) attests the exomembrane localization of the protein component. Both the B and T-cell epitopes are considerate for obtaining the maximum immune response through humoral and cell mediated immunity. The epitopes were identified through sequence based prediction method using the several web prediction servers. After retrieving the protein sequence of virulence factor Mce  family protein (GenBank: SFL64340.1) from NCBI database, it is processed through the ABCpred server for B-cell epitope motif. The 20 numbers of B-cell epitopes having considering threshold value are again submitted to ProPred and ProPred-I servers simultaneously for MHC-II and MHC-I binding allele (Barh et al. 2010). The common epitopes are shortened to only 9mers because of ProPred prediction module provides only 9meric epitopes. The epitopes VLGSSVQTA, VNIELKPEF and VVPSNLFAV were selected for vaccine designing after accurate validation against antigenic property through Vaxijen server. These are highly antigenic (VLGSSVQTA = 1.1110, VNIELKPEF = 2.4569 and VVPSNLFAV = 1.0810) being laid over the customized threshold antigenic score. This research design reveled that, three epitopes are the finest vaccine components as identified by B-cell and MHC molecules. The motif of the particular epitopes was mapped out through DISTILL 2.0 for conformational uniqueness and molecular docking. Intend to proper binding of epitopes with the T cell receptor delta chain reflects through the significantly lower ACE values. The structural profile of virulence factor Mce family protein also been mapped out via Phyre2 server that will be fundamental for therapeutics to design the vaccine. The epitopes VLGSSVQTA, VNIELKPEF and VVPSNLFAV will be much more effectual for perfect designing of epitopic vaccine against N. asteroides limiting nocardiosis and subsequent casualties linked with it.",

Existing research will be surely valuable in modern therapeutics purposes, to resist the nocardiosis outbreak. Particular manifestation of antigenicity by the common B and T-cell epitopes (VLGSSVQTA, VNIELKPEF and VVPSNLFAV) substantiates the critical aptitude to generate humoral and cell mediated immunity. Consequently, the targeted epitopes assist for easy interaction with the immune receptors favor to transmembrane localization of protein element. Literal structural signature of considerable protein along with its epitopes served as decisive factor for novel vaccine development. However, the epitopes requires substantial in vivo and in vitro justification for accurate refinement to generate finest vaccine component restricting the nocardia infection. Such computer aided research techniques are also highly influential and efficient for designing of desired epitopic vaccine against several associated diseases in light of immunoinformatics.",
