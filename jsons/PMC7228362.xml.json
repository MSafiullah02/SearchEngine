Once inside the cell, however, a virus hijacks the cellular machinery forcing it to produce more viruses.\n10\n Outside the host cell, a virus packs itself into individual infectious particles called virions. The chemical composition of a virion varies from virus to virus and is an important distinguishing character used in classification of viruses.\n11\n A virion typically contains a genome made up of one or several segments of single or double stranded DNA or RNA. A coat of structural viral proteins called the capsid surrounds this genome. In some viruses, the capsid itself is surrounded by a host cell\u2010membrane derived envelope.\n10\n, \n11\n\n",

In general, a virus is able to cause an epidemic if R\n0 > 1. An outbreak ends when R0 falls below one.\n22\n, \n23\n\n",

As a result, the viral genome enters the cytoplasm.\n14\n In the following stage, direct translation of the positive\u2010sense viral RNA genome leads to de novo synthesis of viral structural and NSPs. The NSPs, coded by the viral replicase gene, are responsible for the replication of the viral genome. This is followed by the \"assembly\" or \u201cmaturation\u201d stage where newly synthesized viral structural proteins, viz. E, M and S are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum\u2010trans Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Viral genomes coated with the N protein then enter the ERGIC via budding to form mature virions. Mature virions then travel to the cell surface inside vesicles and exit the cells by exocytosis.\n14\n A novel furin\u2010like cleavage site has recently been discovered in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.
