            "text": "Breathing frequency (breaths/min) differs among individuals and levels of physical activity. Particles enter respirators through two principle penetration pathways: faceseal leakage and filter penetration. However, it is unknown how breathing frequency affects the overall performance of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and surgical masks (SMs) against viral particles, as well as other health-relevant submicrometer particles. A FFR and SM were tested on a breathing manikin at four mean inspiratory flows (MIFs) (15, 30, 55, and 85 L/min) and five breathing frequencies (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 breaths/min). Filter penetration (P filter ) and total inward leakage (TIL) were determined for the tested respiratory protection devices against sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol particles in the size range of 20 to 500 nm. \"Faceseal leakage-to-filter\" (FLTF) penetration ratios were calculated. Both MIF and breathing frequency showed significant effects (p < 0.05) on P filter and TIL. Increasing breathing frequency increased TIL for the N95 FFR whereas no clear trends were observed for the SM. Increasing MIF increased P filter and decreased TIL resulting in decreasing FLTF ratio. Most of FLTF ratios were >1, suggesting that the faceseal leakage was the primary particle penetration pathway at various breathing frequencies.",

            "text": "T he National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are widely used in various occupational environments to reduce workers' exposure to hazardous aerosols. In healthcare environments, N95 FFRs and surgical masks (SMs) are the most commonly used devices to prevent transmission of infectious diseases. (1, 2) N95 FFRs are certified by NIOSH in accordance with Title 42 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. (3) The letter \"N\" stands for non-oil-resistance, and the number \"95\" denotes the filter efficiency of at least 95% when the filter is challenged with NaCl aerosols having a mass median aerodynamic particle diameter of 300 nm (the most penetrating particle size, MPPS, for mechanical filters) at a constant flow of 85 L/min. (4) Presently, the vast majority of FFRs are manufactured utilizing electrostatic fibers, which feature much smaller MPPS: 30 to 100 nm. (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) The latter range includes many viral species. SMs are not subject to NIOSH filter certification approval; instead they are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Previous studies have shown that the filter efficiency for SMs is much lower than that for N95 FFRs. (5, (13) (14) (15) Besides filter penetration, faceseal leakage can have a significant impact on the performance of N95 FFRs and SMs. One study showed that the efficiency of N95 FFRs was high when sealed to a manikin headform but decreased significantly due to faceseal leakage when the same respirators were tested on human subjects. (16) NIOSH has proposed total inward leakage (TIL) testing to assess respirator performance since it takes into account both penetration pathways. (17) Grinshpun and colleagues quantified the relative contributions of the two pathways for a N95 FFR and a SM by determining the filter penetration (P filter ) and faceseal leakage penetration (P leakage ) using manikin-based and human subject-based experimental protocols. (13) The \"faceseal leakage-to-filter\" ratio (FLTF = P leakage /P filter ) was > 1, indicating a greater number of particles penetrated through faceseal leaks than the filter media. (13) While the quoted study addressed a wide range of particle sizes (30 -1000 nm), it did not examine breathing frequency.",

(18, 19) Viral airborne particles (known as virions) are generally much smaller than airborne bacteria. Most naked viruses referenced in the literature are between 20 and 300 nm in diameter. (20) For instance, coronavirus, the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a primary physical size ranging from 80 to 140 nm; the avian influenza virus (H5N1 and H1N1) is between 80 to 120 nm. (21, 22) The size range of aerosol particles containing viruses (often referred to as \"carriers\") found in an occupational setting is substantially larger as they may consist of respiratory secretions, dead cells, mucous, and so on, in addition to single viruses or virus aggregates. (23) (24) (25) However, particles < 500 nm are capable of penetrating deeper in the respiratory tract during inhalation; this range also includes particles featuring the highest penetration through most of respiratory protection devices and filters. In addition, the differences in filtration performance between surgical masks and FFRs are less noticeable for the particles of around 1 \u03bcm or larger. (5, 13, 14) Therefore, this study was focused on particle sizes of < 500 nm.",

            "text": "The Institute of Medicine estimates that during an influenza pandemic, more than 13 million healthcare workers and patients, and their family members and friends may need respiratory protection devices to protect them from contracting or spreading infectious illness. (26) Among population groups (e.g., young vs. old, small vs. large, healthy vs. sick), breathing frequency (breaths/min) differs and will differ significantly with level of physical activity (e.g., at rest vs. active). (27, 28) In addition, studies examining the physiological impact of respirators on healthcare workers reported that wearing a FFR did not impose any important physiological burden during one hour of use at realistic clinical work rates (16 -27 breaths/min at low to moderate work rates). The use of a surgical mask over the same period at a low-to-moderate work rate was not associated with clinically significant physiological impact or significant subjective perceptions of exertion or heat. (29) (30) (31) Human breathing has a cyclic flow pattern, which is primarily determined by mean inspiratory flow (MIF, L/min) and breathing frequency (breaths/min). Unlike the constant flow regime with a fixed flow rate, the cyclic regime features a constantly changing flow that depends on the level of the breathing frequency. Various studies have addressed the effect of flow rate on filter efficiency and faceseal leakage. (32) (33) (34) (35) However, with the exception of our recent study in which an elastomeric half-mask respirator was tested, (36) no published study has evaluated the effect of breathing frequency on the performance of N95 FFRs and SMs when both filter and faceseal leakage penetration pathways are present.",

(5, 7, 16) This suggests that inert aerosol surrogates such as NaCl particles may generally be appropriate for predicting penetration of similarly sized virions. The present manikinbased study addresses the effects of breathing frequency and flow rate on the filter efficiency and faceseal leakage of a N95 FFR and a SM challenged with NaCl particles (20 -500 nm), which represent many viral species, as well as other healthrelevant particles (e.g., combustion-generated or engineered nanoparticles). The tested N95 FFR/SM was sealed to a plastic manikin headform to investigate filter performance. It was also donned without sealing to a different advanced manikin headform to quantify TIL. The advanced manikin utilized in this study was recently developed to mimic the properties of the human face. (37, 38) Faceseal leakage represents the difference between TIL and filter penetration. The hypothesis of this study was that the P filter as well as the TIL of FFRs and SMs are generally affected by MIF and breathing frequency.",

This result can be explained by the differences in linear air velocities. Penetration of very small particles, which deposit on filter fibers primarily due to diffusion, increases with a decreasing residence time (also known as removal time). Thus, small particles are more likely to penetrate the filter at higher breathing flows. At the higher flows (MIF = 55 and 85 L/min), the P filter curves are not flat, in contrast to those at the 15 and 30 L/min, suggesting that the effects of lower breathing frequencies are more pronounced at higher MIFs.",

The breathing frequency comparisons show that 10 and 15 breaths/min produced higher values of P filter (0.39% and 0.38%, Tukey grouping I) than those observed at 20, 25, and 30 breaths/min (0.25%, 0.23%, and 0.26%, respectively, Tukey grouping II). Figure 1B presents the results obtained from the TIL measurements for the tested N95 FFR. It is seen that the MIF of 15 L/min produced the highest TILs. Interestingly, the TIL increased with increasing the breathing frequency, especially at MIF = 15 L/min. The exhaled particle-free air dilutes the aerosol in the respirator cavity. At a higher breathing frequency (given the same MIF), the dilution air volume per breathing cycle is lower, which results in a less efficient dilution and consequently increases the aerosol concentration inside the respirator. This explains why a higher breathing frequency produced a higher TIL.",

            "text": "B reathing frequency was found to be another factor (in addition to MIF) that can significantly affect the performance of N95 FFRs and SMs. However, the filter mechanism causing P filter to change as a function of breathing frequency is complex and not fully understood at this time. For the tested N95 FFR, the increase of breathing frequency caused an increase in TIL. No consistent trend of increase or decrease of TIL with either MIF or breathing frequency was observed for the tested SM. To potentially extend these findings beyond the manikin/breathing system used, future studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism causing the breathing frequency effect on the performance of FFRs and SMs on human subjects. The FLTF ratios obtained for the N95 FFR were generally higher than those for the SM for all tested breathing frequencies and MIFs, primarily because of the higher efficiency of the N95 filter. Increasing MIF was also generally associated with decreasing FLTF ratio for the tested FFR/SM. Except for MIF = 85 L/min, all the calculated FLTF ratios were > 1, suggesting that the faceseal leakage was the primary particle penetration pathway for the tested FFR/SM at various breathing frequencies.",
