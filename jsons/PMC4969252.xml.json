Involved in proinflammatory cytokine response, it is discussed to be responsible for immunopathology in several inflammatory or autoimmune diseases [16]. It controls nonlymphoid tissue DC homeostasis [18] and was currently reported to modulate the development of inflammatory macrophages and monocytes [19]. In the lung, GM-CSF was shown not only to play a role in allergic airway disease [20, 21] but also to be crucial for antimicrobial pulmonary host defense function [22\u201324]. Additionally, it is essential for surfactant homeostasis. GM-CSF-deficient mice develop a similar pathology to human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [25]. An exceeded accumulation of surfactant phospholipids and proteins in the alveolar lining fluid impairs gas exchange and patients show increased susceptibility for microbial infections [22]. PAP is found to be associated with GM-CSF or GM-CSF receptor auto-antibodies or dysfunction [26].",

            "text": "It is well established that AEC-released GM-CSF improves innate immune responses of myeloid cells, in particular alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages of GM-CSF-deficient mice show abnormalities in morphology, maturation, and function, depending on transcription factor PU.1 [22, 26]. Sever-Chroneos et al. [30] found a decreased resistance to IV in GM-CSF-deficient mice due to impaired pathogen clearance by macrophages. This is stressed by findings from Berclaz et al. who demonstrated that the Fc\u0263 receptor (Fc\u0263R)-mediated opsonophagocytosis of invaded pathogens by alveolar macrophages is highly dependent on GM-CSF signaling via PU.1 [31]. T cell-produced interferon \u0263 (IFN \u0263) during course of infection also effected augmented Fc\u0263R levels on alveolar macrophages which in turn stimulated IFN \u0263 production by secretion of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-18, IL-12), linking innate and adaptive immunity in a positive feedback loop. Elevated alveolar GM-CSF level in transgenic mice increased numbers and resistance of alveolar macrophages and provided protection against lethal IV infections [32]. Subramaniam et al. [33] observed a GM-CSF-dependent protection through stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by macrophages not only against IV pneumonia itself but also against secondary bacterial pneumonia, a major cause of morbidity and mortality after IV infection. However, GM-CSF-dependent activation of pulmonary innate immunity does not explain the beneficial effects of AEC GM-CSF in IV infection in total. Lung CD103+ DCs were found to be key players for the GM-CSF-dependent lung protective effect by our group [28]. After IV infection, pulmonary CD103+ DCs are expanded and activated and their migration and antigen (Ag) presentation to the draining mediastinal lymph nodes is mediated by GM-CSF. This is associated with a better viral clearance and Ag-specific T cell recruitment, suggesting improved resident lung DC host defense capacities during IV infection by AEC GM-CSF. Min et al. [34] identified GM-CSF to be a major licensing factor of CD8+ T lymphocytes to activate DCs during priming in lymphoid tissue, providing a positive feedback loop in the stimulation of CD8+ T cell proliferation. Accordingly, Greter et al. [18] revealed GM-CSF to be indispensable for the induction of specific CD8+ T cell immunity. Chen et al. [35] also found GM-CSF to promote T cell, B cell, and DC maturation in order to enable the production of IV specific antibodies.",

In a bleomycin rat model, it was shown that defects in AEC II GM-CSF secretion are crucial for pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis [38]. Sturrock et al. displayed certain microRNAs (miRNAs) (133a and 133b) to suppress protective AEC GM-CSF secretion by inhibition of GM-CSF messenger RNA (mRNA) translation in oxidative stress [39]. This effect seemed to be AEC specific as the same miRNAs did not suppress T cell GM-CSF expression during hyperoxia.",

Another trial in adult patients with acute lung injury (ALI) failed to improve survival and ventilation parameters by intravenous GM-CSF application [45]. Regarding the mouse model, a high local concentration of GM-CSF in the alveolar lining fluid seems to be more promising than systemic application and also prevents systemic side effects. Alveolar GM-CSF is required in a distinct local quantity to balance pathogen clearance and immunopathology. This is why GM-CSF treatment should preferentially be investigated via the inhaled route in contrast to systemic application. Inflammation itself leads to compromised lung barrier integrity, causing systemic loss of locally delivered GM-CSF. Current strategies in the mouse model focus on GM-CSF conjugation to enhance bioavailability, prolong half-life, and reduce systemic side-effects of administered GM-CSF [46].",

With regard to pneumonia-associated ARDS an off-label treatment with inhaled GM-CSF revealed an improvement in oxygenation and morbidity [49]. GM-CSF treatment increased activation of alveolar macrophages, important for host defense function. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of inhaled GM-CSF in adult patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS (GI-HOPE) was recently started within the nationwide German Center for Lung Research (NCT02595060). Similarly, an interventional safety/efficacy study for inhaled GM-CSF treatment in children with respiratory virus-associated ARDS has been implemented (iGRASP, NCT02601365), highlighting the strong potential of this drug in both adults and children suffering from severe viral pneumonia and related ARDS.",

The clinical trials mentioned above investigate GM-CSF treatment not exclusively in IV pneumonia but in (viral) pneumonia-associated ARDS in general. While in the mouse model, specific conditions can be studied in detail, clinical conditions are different. In the clinical setting, the underlying germ of infection is not always clearly defined when patients present with pneumonia/ARDS and therapy needs to be initiated. Furthermore, bacterial superinfection of primary viral pneumonia is a common complication. GM-CSF-mediated protective effects are not limited to IV infection as they result in improvement of host defense capacities and epithelial repair in general, both critical processes in ARDS patients. GM-CSF might be working similarly in other respiratory viral infections as well. It was reported to prevent RSV-exacerbated airway hyperresponsiveness by alveolar macrophage maturation [50], for example. Protective effects of GM-CSF were also shown for bacterial pneumonia [23, 51, 52]. For these reasons, clinical studies focus on GM-CSF treatment on patients, who present with pneumonia-associated ARDS rather than exclusively IV pneumonia.",

Innate and adaptive immunity are activated, resulting in accelerated viral clearance. Via PU.1, GM-CSF improves AM resistance, maturation, ROS production, and phagocytosis capacity, e.g., by the Fc\u03b3R-mediated opsonophagocytosis. GM-CSF also stimulates activation and proliferation of DCs, especially CD103+ DCs, and T cells and enhances Ag priming and IV-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment.
