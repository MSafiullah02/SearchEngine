Especially elderly persons are more frequently and severely affected by infectious diseases and they display distinct features with respect to clinical presentation and treatment. Although vaccinations are considered a vital medical procedure for preventing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases, the protective effect ofvaccinations is abrogated in elderly persons. This is due to a decline in the functions of the immune system referred to as immunosenescence. The first part of this chapter will therefore summarize the status quo ofthe efficacy ofvaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality caused by typical infectious diseases in the elderly, such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis. The second part willthen elucidate the underlying age-related mechanisms which may contribute to the decreased efficacy ofvaccines. Based on the complex mechanisms involved in immunosenescence, strategies willbe outlined which may be successful in enhancingprotective immune responses following vaccination in elderly persons.",

For instance, the annual costs ofmedical care for treating infectious diseases in the United States alone is about $120 billion and for treating antimicrobial-resistant infections it may be as high as $5 billion. ' A great success story was the implementation oflarge-scale vaccination strategies that led to the eradication of smallpox in 1980 4 and to a drastic reduction ofpoliomyelitis, tetanus, diphtheria, measles, pertussis and meningitis. Presently, vaccinations are still considered the most cost-effective medical procedure for preventingmorbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. 26 different infectious diseases can be prevented by vaccinations and 61 vaccines are being developed according to a 2004 survey by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers ofAmerica,\" The new candidate vaccines are intended to provide protection against diseases caused by rotavirus, herpes zoster and papilloma virus and will be available from 2007 onwards ( Table 1) . But also improved vaccines against influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis are currently being tested in clinical trials ( Table 1 ).

Split-virus vaccines are used since the 1980s, are cheap and offer a good protection for children above 6 months of age and adults. Recently, subunit vaccines with new adjuvants have been developed (FluadO, Addigrip') that show an increased immunogcnicity, a favorable safety profile and may be more suitable for the vaccination of elderly persons.'! Additionally, invariant antigens, such as M 1 and NP, may also play an important role in protection and could be used in vaccines to induce long-lasting immunity to a variety of different influenza strains. Another strategy to enhance immunogenicity may the use ofvirosomes that are nontoxic , biodegradable lipid-basedantigen-presentation systems.\" Virosomal influenzavaccines, such asInflexalV', InfIuvac Plus'and Invivac'have been on the market in several European countries for a number of years.

Importantly, before administration of live-attenuated vaccines to elderly or immunocompromised persons, an acceptable safety profile has to be demonstrated.

Recently, a vaccine that may prevent herpes zoster virus reactivation has been submitted for registration. This live-attenuated VZV vaccine has been developed to prevent reactivation of herpes zoster in the elderly.3s.36This is of particular importance, because the elderly population has not been vaccinated against but may have been frequently infected by Vzv.

The CMVis transmitted via person-to-person contacts but immunocompetent subjects mostly do not recognize infection as it causes no or few unspecific symptoms. However, a CMV infection represents a severe health problem in immunocompromised persons (e.g.,due to immunosuppressive disease, chemotherapy or transplantation) or in a fetus as a result of congenital infection. Research results over the past decade suggest that CMV favors an accelerated aging of the immune system as CMV infection is chronic and the organism is forced to continuously prevent virus reactivation.F'\" Despite the high frequency of CMV-specific CD8+ Tscells, the virus usually can not be eliminated by the immune system. This is because the virus has evolved several mechanisms to escape the host's immune defense.\" For instance, CMV encodes for a type ofproteins called immunoevasins that modulate the presentation ofviral peptides or directly suppress cellular immune responses. Hence, the accumulation of CMV-specific T-cells substantially constricts the diversity of the T-cell repertoire\" and leads to the production ofproinflammatory cytokines, such as gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha.'? This imbalance in the cytokine production profile may not only promote the pathogenesis of age-related diseasesf but leads to a decreased production of antibodies following influenza vaccination in elderly persons.fA few antiviral substances including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir are available to prevent CMV infection in immunocompromised patients. But antiviral therapy is limited by its severe adverse reactions, such as neutropenia, nephrotoxicity, hypocalcemia and seizures. Another strategy is the adoptive transfer ofdonor-derived CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that may restore the host's immunity against CMV. 44 Despite the need ofa safe and potent vaccine that prevents CMV disease, no vaccine candidate has yet entered the market. A few vaccines against CMV are currently in phase IIII clinical trials (Table 1) . Active immunization against CMV could reduce the incidence ofneonatal infections as well as complications in immunocompromised persons and may prevent CMV-associated premature aging ofthe immune system when applied early in life.",

Although most infants are being immunized against pertussis in industrialized countries, immunity usually fades during adolescence.

            "text": "Hepatitis A is an acute disease ofthe liver caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAY), a nonenveloped virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. Each year, an estimated 1.5 million cases ofhepatitis A occur worldwide. HAY infection induces life-long immunity and is usually asymptomatic in young children, whereas adults frequently experience symptomatic disease. HAY is acquired directly from infected persons by close contact or by the consumption ofcontaminated drinking water, vegetables, fruits or shells. HAY vaccination is recommended when traveling to tropic and subtropic countries that have an increased risk of infection. For instance, the risk ofhepatitis A infection ofpersons traveling to developing countries was estimated to be 3 to 20 cases per 1000 persons per month ofstay,varying with destination, living conditions and age.\" Improved sanitary standards in developed countries have reduced the opportunity for environmental exposure to HAY and have lowered the overall incidence ofinfection. Paradoxically, susceptibility to the virus increased because of the decrease in natural immunity. Consequently, less than 20% ofpersons born after 1945 have a natural immunity against HAy'54 In contrast to hepatitis B and C that may lead to the manifestation of a chronic infection, clinical illness after hepatitis A infection is usually mild in young individuals. But increasing age represents an enhanced risk ofsevere infection and mortality rates are about 2% for persons over 40 and 4% for those over 60 years ofage.\" Several vaccines against hepatitis A are available (Table 2 ) and a study of773 adults showed that immunogenicity and safety profiles between 'Iwinrix' and Havrix' are comparable.56 But there is some evidence oflower antibody titers with advanced age. For instance, the seroconversion rates 8 months after two doses ofHavrix' were found to be 85% and 60% for adults < 35 years and >35 years, respectively.57After the recommended immunization schedule with Twinrix'.seroprotection was 92% and 63% for adults <40 years and >60 years, respectively.58 Therefore, it may be useful to measure HAY antibodies in elderly persons, as in the case ofvaccination failure, boosters have shown to be effective.\" It is further recommended that the vaccine is given at least 3 to 4 weeks before travel due to a slower onset ofthe antibody response in elderly individuals. 59 Another travel vaccine is directed against yellow fever (YF), which is endemic in tropic regions ofAfrica and South America. YF is transmitted by the bite ofinfective Aedes aegypti and other mosquitoes that bite during daylight hours in regions below 2500 meters ofaltitude. Most infections lead to an acute illness characterized by fever, muscular pain, headache, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, often with bradycardia. After a few days, about 15% ofpatients progress to a second phase, with resurgence offever,development ofjaundice, abdominal pain and haemorrhagic manifestations. Halfofthese persons die 10-14days after the onset ofillness. The WHO estimates that a total of200,000 cases ofYF occur each year, with about 30,000 deaths. 6oYF also represents a significant risk to more than 3 million travelers that visit YF-endemic areas each year. Neonates and elderly individuals demonstrate the highest mortality when infected by the YF virus. As there is no specific antiviral treatment against YF available yet, vaccination is the only way to protect persons from YF disease. The currently available vaccine contains a live-attenuated 17D strain virus ( Table 2 ) and has been shown to be safe and highly potent.\" However, due to the increased use in international travelers, it has become evident that advanced age might be a risk factor for serious adverse effects and even deam. 62 Compared with persons aged 25-44 years, individuals aged <75 had an 18-fold greater risk to experience serious adverse events after vaccination. The rate for systemic illness requiring hospitalization or leading to death after YF vaccination was reported to be 3.5 per 100,000 among people 65 to 75 years of age and 9.1 per 100,000 for people more than 75 years. Furthermore, there are no studies available that demonstrated the efficacy of the YF vaccine in elderly persons. Accordingly, recommendations and manufacturing standards have been modified to increase vaccine safety in elderly persons. Although the benefit-risk ratio still favors the vaccination ofpeople at high risk for infection and outlines the vaccine's fundamental role in disease prevention and control, efforts to improve safety and to ensure vaccine efficacy in elderly persons are ofurgent need.",

            "text": "The term immunosenescence refers to a complex remodeling ofthe immune system in old age and may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Thymic involution, telomere shortening, T-cell signal transduction changes, alterations in the interaction of the innate and adaptive immune response, impaired DNA repair and antioxidant mechanisms as well as persistent antigenic stress may all be factors contributing to immunosenescence. Although perturbations ofinnate immune system components have been described, much ofthe decrease in immunoresponsiveness seen in elderly people is associated with changes in T-cell responses. This is due to the continuous loss offunctional thymic tissue with increasing age. 63.64The thymus, the central lymphoid organ, is responsible for the maturation and selection ofso-called naive T-cells that regenerate the peripheral Tcell pool and retain the capability ofthe immune system to respond to a variety ofdifferent pathogens. In old age, the number ofnaive T-celIs decreases while the number ofantigen-experienced 'Tcells increases. 65 .66 These antigen-experienced T-celIs include a substantial proportion of senescent memory-effector T-cells that accumulate in elderly persons. Senescent memory-effector TcelIs display phenotypic (loss ofcostimulatory molecules such as CD28 and CD40L) as well as functional changes (altered cytokine production profile, decreased proliferative response, shortened telomeres, increased resistance to programmed cell-death and restricted T-cell diversity).67.68Ofparticular importance, the senescent CD8+CD28-memory-effector T-cell population predominantly produces the pro-inflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (IFNy), but does not produce interleukin 2 (IL-2) and the anti-inflammatory, B-cell stimulating cytokine IL-4. 43 Recent data also support the hypothesis that chronic infection with the cytomegalovirus, \u00e3 -herpesvirus, may lead to a decrease in the size ofthe naive and early memory CD8+ T-cell pool, but to an increase in the number of dysfunctional, IFNy-producing CD8+CD28-memory-effector Tvcells (Fig. 2) , 37 One clinical consequence of the accumulation of CD8+CD28-T-cells is an impaired generation of protective antibody levels after vaccination. 43.69 Furthermore, the age-dependent increase in the level ofpro-inflammatory cyrokines may lead to ubiquitous chronic inflammatory responses in old age 42 and may therefore support the development of age-related chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis,\" rheumatoid arthritis\" and Alzheimer's disease. 72, 73 Although individuals maintain a relatively constant total number ofperipheral B-celIs during aging, each B-cell subset comprises severeperturbations in size,dynamics and repertoire. The alterations affecting the Bvcell subsets are due to a decreased generation ofB-cell precursors, such asearly lymphoid precursors and pro-Bvcells, Cell-intrinsic as well as micro-environmental disturbances are both likely to contribute to the decreased output ofpro-Bscells. Furthermore, alterations in environmental factors also impair overall V(D)J recombinase activity among pro-Bvcellst'whlch accounts for the limited B-cell repertoire frequendy detected in elderly persons.\" Although no decrease in overall serum immunoglobulin levels have been observed during aging, the antibodies generated in old age are oflower affinity due to a shift in antibody isotypes from IgG to IgM,76 Of particular importance, B-celIs from elderly individuals are stimulated 70% less efficiendy by follicular dendritic cells than Bvcells from young subjects,\" suggesting loss ofB-cell function, in part due to the decreased expression ofcostimulatory molecules, such as CD40 or CD27,78 Impaired T-cell-mediated immunity as well as defects in antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells ",

Research of the last decade has provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms ofthe immune response in old age, which can now be used for th e development of potent vaccines. In the past, vaccines were primarily designed to elicit a strong humoral immune response . However, vaccines in elderly persons may be more effective ifthe stimulate innate immune components and the generation of long-lived memory T-cells. Currently,severalstrategies are being pursued to increase immunogeniclry, to minimize adverse side effects and to increase vaccine acceptance by introducing needle-free injection devices. Proven and promisingvaccine technologies are used to design conjugate, subunit, live vector, DNA and live-attenuated vaccines (Table 3) .80 While live-attenuated vaccines (e.g.\u2022 against varicella, measles or yellow fever) stimulate numerous immune components and display enhanced immunogenicity, conjugate and subunit vaccines (e.g., against influenza) are often supplemented with adjuvants\" to ensure their protective effect. Generally, adjuvants can be divided into antigen delivery systems (cationic microparticles, proteasomes and virus-like particles) and immune potentiators (e.g.\u2022 cytokines). These adjuvants may overcome the proposed age-related functional decline ofinnate immune responses by targeting pattern-recognition receptors, such as the recently identified toll-like receptors or nucleotide-bindingoligomerization domain proteins.\" The enhanced activation ofthe innate immune system may also improve antigen processing and presentation leading to more potent T and B-cell responses and to sustained immunological memory. Vaccines supplemented with the DNA of cytokines (e.g., IL-2 , IL-? IL-I2, IL-IS or IL-21 ), chemokines or costirnulatory molecules may magnify immune responses by generating more and long-lived memory T_ceIIs83-85and may overcome immunodominance.'\"",

Increased public awareness of regular booster vaccinations in adults should be enforced, as these immunization regimes may be essential to maintain the ability to respond to recall antigens in old age. Recent result s also indicate that long-lasting protection but also a good booster effect can be expected even a long time after the last vaccination, when a live-attenuated vaccine (e.g., polio vaccine) is used for primary immunization in early life.

Thus, decreased numbers of CD28+ and CD40L+T -cells and a lack of cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4, are both likely to endanger normal Tvcell/Bccell communication, B-cell growth, differentiation and antibody production in the elderly.",
