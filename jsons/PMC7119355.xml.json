These conditions require emergency care.\u2022The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises the use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIAs) in adults and NSAIAs in children for the treatment of pain. There are several studies that show that NSAIAs relieve pharyngitis pain better than acetaminophen.\u2022Penicillin remains the antibiotic of choice of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis.

There were more than 15 million outpatient visits for pharyngitis in 2007 in the United States.1 Overtreatment of non\u2013group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infections is one of the major causes of inappropriate use of antibiotics. Patient\u2019s expectations are not for antibiotics, but for pain relief, reassurance, and information. When questioned, those who hoped for an antibiotic did so with the belief that an antibiotic would give pain relief. Therefore, it behooves the medical provider to have a rational, practical, and evidence-based approach to the treatment of pharyngitis.",

            "text": "In most European guidelines, treatment of GAS is with symptomatic treatment alone.16 It is considered a self-limiting disease and antibiotics are not commonly recommended because they provide only moderate clinical benefits in a disease with low complication rates. Antibiotics are only prescribed for severe cases. There is a growing body of evidence that treating all patients with GAS pharyngitis to prevent a rare case of RF is not clinically prudent.8 Penicillin anaphylaxis occurs in approximately 0.015% of patients, with a fatality rate from shock of 0.002%. Overall morbidity from 10 days of antibiotics may be as high as 10%.",
