This hypothesis is supported by the finding that overlaps, thought for a long time to be restricted to viruses, also occur in the large genomes of prokaryotic (Delaye et al., 2008; Fellner et al., 2015) and eukaryotic organisms (Szklarczyk et al., 2007; Bergeron et al., 2013; Vanderperre et al., 2013).",

Normalization was the square root of the ratio between the chi-square value and the overall length of the two proteins encoded by the overlap (e.g. the highest chi-square value, 113.83, was converted into the highest normalized chi-square value, 0.42).",

In particular, the first two stringent criteria (an equal length of the homolog and an alignment with a minimal number of indels) led to exclusion, for some overlaps, of highly divergent homologs. An example is given by the overlap P3N-PIPO/polyprotein of Turnip mosaic virus, in which the length of the P3N-PIPO protein is quite variable among the different potyvirus species, ranging from 60 to 115 amino acids (Hillung et al., 2013). Thus, the dataset used in this study likely underestimates the sequence diversity of overlapping genes, as it was created mainly to ensure a high quality in the homologous relationship.",

This peculiar arrangement is similar to that of the overlap p19/p22 from Tomato bushy stunt virus, in which the de novo p19 protein shows a previously unknown structural fold an a previously unknown mechanism of binding to small interfering RNAs (Vargason et al., 2003; Baulcombe and Moln\u00e1r, 2004; Scholthof, 2006).
