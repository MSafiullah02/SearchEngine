Site directed mutagenesis was used to create the consensus cleavage sites corresponding to that of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and some coronaviruses within the full length SARS-CoV S glycoprotein gene in pCDNA3. The QuickChange Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) was used and the protocol suggested by manufacturer was followed. For expression of various N-terminal S fragments, the corresponding gene fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pSecTag2 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad).

However, we and others have previously localized the SARS-CoV RBD downstream from the extreme N-terminus [5], [7], [9]. To address the possibility for oligomerization of RBD-containing fragments and their function in mediating membrane fusion we used our previously described fragments [5] including the one from the extreme N-terminus (residues 17 through 276 denoted as S276) which does not bind the receptor ACE2 and several (S756, S537, and S272\u2013537) which bind it as well as another one from residue 317 through 517 denoted as S317\u2013517 that still retains receptor binding activity. These fragments were also selected because they fold independently and are secreted in the cell culture supernatant although the efficiency of their expression varied significantly (Fig. 1A\n, left) and their concentration was decreased when coexpressed with S756 (Fig. 1A, right).",

Two elution peaks were observed: one due to species of molecular weight of about 230 kDa and the other one\u2014of about 110 kDa (Fig. 2A\n, upper panel) corresponding presumably to a dimer and a monomer.

Both mutants did not exhibit any fusion activity compared to the wild type full-length S glycoprotein which did (Fig. 1A). To test whether differential level of expression could account for lack of observable fusogenic activity we measured the surface and overall levels of expression by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The data from both assays suggested that the level of expression of the two deletion mutants is undistinguishable from that of the wild type (Figs. 3B and C\n).

Because the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was recently found to be class I fusion protein it appears likely that the S2 subunit would confer a trimeric state to the whole S glycoprotein. However, a dimeric state of S1 with a trimeric S2 could theoretically lead to higher order oligomers in dependence on the availability of the dimerization binding site in the context of the native S glycoprotein. To test such a possibility we measured approximately the size of the soluble S ectodomains (Se) where the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail were deleted [5] by gel filtration. The data shown in Fig. 5\ndemonstrate the existence of a trimeric state of Se (Mw 512 kDa) and lack of higher order oligomers. These results not only suggest that the Se and perhaps the full-length membrane-associated S are trimers in their native unbound state but also indicate that the dimerization site in S1 is not readily available for inter-trimer interactions.",

What is the role of S1 dimerization for mediation of membrane fusion however remains unclear. It is now generally accepted that soluble ectodomains (gp140) of the HIV-1 and SIV envelope glycoproteins (Env) form trimers [18] although dimers and tetramers can be observed [19]. Similarly, it appears that at least a possible fusion intermediate quaternary structure of coronaviruses including the SARS-CoV of S2 is trimeric [12], [13]. However, remarkably it was reported that the MHV S2 protein is monomeric after dissociation from S1 [16]. Dimer-to-trimer transitions play a critical role in the mechanism of fusion mediated by class II fusion proteins. Thus, it has been proposed that changes in the quaternary structure of some coronaviruses may play a role in the fusion mechanism [16]. One should note that both the HIV-1 Env and the MHV S glycoprotein are cleaved and the SU can dissociate from the TM subunit although such dissociation may not be important for fusion. In contrast, the SARS-CoV S is not cleaved when expressed in membrane associated or soluble form and cleavage may not be required for fusion. Thus, although the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein, the lack of cleavage is an exception from the rule that the Envs of class I fusion proteins are cleaved presumably to confer a metastable high-energy state that could drive the fusion reaction.",

Even if in the trimer two of the monomers form a dimer, then the third one could be free to interact with a \u201cfree\u201d monomer from another trimer and form a dimer of trimers. In another possible scenario the orientation of each of the monomers in the trimer may not allow formation of dimers in the trimer but leave \u201cfree\u201d binding sites for dimerization with monomers from other trimers. In this case one might expect the formation of a network of trimers. Finally, the three-dimensional structure of the trimer may not allow any interactions of the monomer dimerization sites with other monomers in the same or different trimer. We have not observed higher order oligomers under our gel filtration conditions indicating that under those conditions either intratrimer dimerization occurs but the third monomer conformation does not allow interactions with monomers from other trimers or such interactions are too weak to be detected, or the trimer three-dimensional structure is such that it does not allow dimerization interactions.",

Such networks, if any, could increase the avidity of interaction with receptor molecules and perhaps facilitate the formation of the fusion pore structure by providing a preassembled network of Env molecules or even provide energy to drive the fusion reaction in the absence of S cleavage that generates a high-energy metastable state. Further experiments are needed to test the validity of such a hypothesis, which in the absence of data directly supporting it remains highly speculative.",
