Each assay has a number of advantages and disadvantages. CPE assay and plaque assay are widely used and are cost-effective, but relatively time-consuming and have low throughput. Although qPCR assay is a highly specific method, it is expensive and requires preparation of RNA and specific primers for viral factors. ELISA is also a highly specific method, but it requires multiple washing and incubation steps due to the heterogeneous assay conditions. Therefore, a simple, rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput assay is required for basic research and screening of new antiviral agents.",

Moreover, we determined whether the dsRNA-HTRF assay could detect the concentration- and time-dependent signals. Increasing the concentration of poly(I:C) resulted in a significant increase in HTRF signal (Delta F%) (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Furthermore, these signals increased in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 1C). In addition, these signals were abolished by dsRNA-specific nuclease RNase III (Supplementary Fig. 1D), indicating that these HTRF signals were specifically detected for dsRNA. Accordingly, in further experiments, the reaction conditions of 4 \u00b0C for 24 h were used, and serial dilution of poly(I:C) was used as a standard curve to determine the HTRF signal.",

Therefore, to evaluate whether the dsRNA-HTRF assay can detect (+) ssRNA viruses, we focused on infection by picornaviruses represented by HRV. When H1-HeLa cells were infected with HRV-B14, HTRF signals were clearly detected in a MOI-dependent manner (Fig. 2\nA). Furthermore, these potentiated signals were also detected in a time-dependent manner, while non-infected cells hardly showed detectable HTRF signals (Fig. 2B). Cells infected with HRV-B14 at MOI of 1 for 24 h and MOI of 0.1 for 32 h showed cytotoxicity and cell detachment. The Z\u2032 factor for this HTRF assay was 0.72, and the signal-to-background (S/B) ratio was 68, on comparison of mean values between MOI of 0 (non-infection) and MOI of 0.1 at 24 h post infection. In addition, we examined whether the dsRNA-HTRF assay could detect a single cycle of viral replication. Single-cycle growth of HRV is considered to take about 7 h [8]. H1-HeLa cells were infected with HRV-B14 at MOI of 10 to achieve single-cycle growth, and viral dsRNA was detected at 6 h post-infection using the dsRNA-HTRF assay (Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating that this assay could evaluate the single-cycle growth of HRV-B14. Cytotoxicity was observed at 24 h post-infection at MOI of 10. Moreover, significant amounts of dsRNA were detected for enterovirus (EV)-A71, coxsackievirus (CV)-A21, EV-D68, and CV-B3, which belong to the picornaviruses, in a manner dependent on the MOI by the dsRNA-HTRF assay (Supplementary Fig. 3A \u2013 D). The amounts of murine norovirus (MNV)-S7 dsRNA, which belongs to the genus Norovirus, were also measured by the dsRNA-HTRF assay (Supplementary Fig. 3E). No cytotoxicity was observed under these conditions. The RNase III abolished the infection-induced potentiated signals (Supplementary Fig. 4A \u2013 C). These results indicated that the dsRNA-HTRF assay can be used to evaluate the proliferation of (+) ssRNA viruses.",

Several anti-dsRNA antibodies are commercially available, which detect multiple (+) ssRNA viruses, e.g., picornaviruses [14], caliciviruses [15], coronaviruses [16], togaviruses [17], and flaviviruses [18,19] using immunofluorescence analysis and/or ELISA. In the present study, we showed that the dsRNA-HTRF assay could detect the proliferation of HRV, CV, EV, and MNV. As most positive-strand RNA viruses produce dsRNA during the replication stage, this assay may be applicable for broad-spectrum detection of other RNA viruses.

In the present study, we showed that the dsRNA-HTRF assay had a Z\u2032 factor of 0.71 \u00b1 0.087 in inhibitor experiments. This assay had a good S/B ratio. Moreover, HTRF technology is simple, rapid, highly robust, and suitable for high-throughput analyses. Therefore, the dsRNA-HTRF assay may provide a new HTS-compatible strategy for the discovery of novel antiviral agents. Further experiments are needed to determine whether this assay can be optimized and miniaturized to meet HTS requirements for screening compound libraries.",

After cell lysis, dsRNA is detected in sandwich HTRF assay using anti-dsRNA antibody labeled with Eu cryptate (donor) and an anti-dsRNA antibody labeled with d2 (acceptor). When both antibodies simultaneously recognize dsRNA, induced proximity between the donor and acceptor units results in FRET under excitation at 317 nm and then leads to acceptor emission (665 nm).",
