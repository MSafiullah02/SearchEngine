Once inhaled, the organisms adhere to the respiratory cilia by way of adhesion molecules (fimbrial adhesions, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and lipopolysaccharides).6 The organisms can evade the host defenses using virulence factors, such as the outer capsule, or the O antigen, which protects the bacteria from phagocytosis and complement mediated attacks.25 Other virulence factors have also been described, including type III secretion systems that allow for bacterial colonization,26, 27, 28 adenylate cyclase toxin with anti-inflammatory and immune evasion properties,29\n,\n30 and exotoxins that cause necrosis of epithelial cells.31 Once colonization has been established, altered respiratory epithelial cell function leads to excessive mucus secretion and further impairment of the local innate immune defenses, predisposing the host to infection by opportunistic secondary pathogens. The incubation period of B bronchiseptica ranges from 2 to 10 days. Clinical signs can vary dramatically. Mild upper-respiratory tract disease can lead to mucopurulent nasal discharge, sneezing, and a cough. In more severe disease cases that involve the lower-respiratory tract, signs of systemic illness can be present, including lethargy, decreased appetite, fever, and a productive cough. The organism can be shed for at least 1 month, and in some cases, for several months.32\n,\n33\n",

Over-the-counter antitussive medications might be somewhat effective in dogs with mild clinical signs. Narcotic antitussives, such as hydrocodone, are more effective at reducing clinical signs; however, administration is contraindicated in animals with productive cough because there can be diminished clearance of bacteria when they are administered, predisposing to secondary infections.79 There are currently no labeled antiviral therapies for dogs with CIRDC and no published recommendations for administration of commercially available influenza antivirals used in human medicine; therefore, antiviral therapy is not recommended.",

The route of vaccine delivery for these pathogens and its impact on the immune response have been debated in the literature. Intranasal or intraoral vaccination has been recommended to improve mucosal immune responses and permit rapid onset of protection in overcrowded environments, such as shelters. However, mucosal vaccination can sometimes result in vaccine-induced disease, and it can be difficult to know whether disease in a shelter environment is secondary to the vaccine or natural infection. Concern has also been raised that intranasal vaccine strains of B bronchiseptica might be capable of causing human disease in the immunosuppressed, although molecular evidence of this is lacking. Vaccination with intranasal vaccines is followed by the development of low titers of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), whereas serum IgG responses are higher after parenteral vaccination.80 A recent study suggested that intranasal vaccination may provide greater clinical protection against challenge than oral vaccination.81 Additional studies are warranted to further assess the optimal vaccine type for dogs. Parenteral vaccines are available for reduction of clinical signs owing to CIVs, including individual H3N8 or H3N2 vaccines and combination (bivalent) vaccines.82\n,\n83 No commercially available vaccines are available for reduction of clinical signs caused by CRCoV and CHV.",
