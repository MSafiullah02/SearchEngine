Achieving early and adequate intake of high-quality colostrum is widely recognized as the single most important management factor in determining the health and survival of neonatal calves.2, 3, 4 The absorption of maternal Ig across the small intestine during the first 24 hours after birth, termed passive transfer, helps to protect the calf against common disease organisms until its own immature immune system becomes functional. In addition to reduced risk for preweaning morbidity and mortality, additional long-term benefits associated with successful passive transfer include reduced mortality in the postweaning period, improved rate of gain, reduced age at first calving, improved first and second lactation milk production, and reduced tendency for culling during the first lactation.5, 6, 7, 8 Benefits from colostrum may be attributed to protective Ig as well as high levels of nutrients and bioactive compounds that stimulate postnatal growth and development.9\n",

The rate of decay of colostral antibodies can be influenced by multiple factors, including active viral infections or vaccination.20, 21, 22\n",

Blood mononuclear cells from 1-day-old calves fed colostrum containing maternal leukocytes were significantly more responsive to bovine viral diarrhea virus, compared with day-old calves that received frozen colostrum or leukocyte-free colostrum.28 In contrast, there was no difference between treatment groups in the response to a mycobacterial antigen that the calves\u2019 dams had not encountered, suggesting that antigen-specific responses measured in a calf following ingestion of maternal colostral leukocytes are related to specific immune memory in the dam. In support of this, cell-mediated immune responses in piglets that nursed maternal colostrum containing leukocytes were significantly higher if their dams had been vaccinated against the tested antigen than if their dams had not been vaccinated.32 Although research has not evaluated the degree of difference in responses induced by colostral leukocytes from a calf\u2019s own dam versus colostral leukocytes from another cow, cross-fostering experiments in piglets suggest that effects of colostral leukocytes on neonatal cell-mediated immunity are greatest when the colostrum contains leukocytes from the neonate\u2019s dam.33\n",

Colostral leukocytes fed alone are not sufficient to protect calves from fatal disease in the neonatal period,34 and recent studies comparing proportions of calves affected by naturally occurring diarrhea or respiratory disease after calves consume fresh maternal colostrum containing leukocytes, or frozen colostrum from their own dam31 or other cows,35 have shown small or variable differences in disease between the groups. Regarding the effect of colostral leukocytes on vaccine responses, Meganck and colleagues36 evaluated humoral and cell-mediated responses to tetanus toxoid vaccination at 2, 5, or 10 days of age in calves fed pooled colostral whey with maternal leukocytes added, or calves fed only pooled colostral whey; this work suggested that colostral leukocytes influenced both tetanus toxoid\u2013specific cell-mediated and humoral responses in calves, but the number of calves tested was small, and the effects measured varied substantially for calves vaccinated at 2, 5, or 10 days of age. Langel and colleagues37 evaluated total (ie, not antigen-specific) monocyte and lymphocyte responses by measuring relative numbers and activation state of calf blood mononuclear cell subsets after routine calfhood vaccination; these investigators found significant differences between groups at certain time points over the months following vaccination. However, the clinical relevance of these differences for immunity against specific pathogens, or resistance to disease, was not defined. In summary, colostral leukocytes modify calf immune responses, and these effects may affect cow health and immunity months or years later. However, to date, effects of colostral leukocytes on practically important health outcomes have not been unequivocally identified, which may in part because it is logistically challenging and expensive to conduct research to measure effects of colostral leukocytes on calf immunity and health, so trials to date may not have included enough calves to provide adequate statistical power to identify small but important health differences.",

Much of the increase in colostrum solids content is attributed to a more than 4-fold increase in protein content of colostrum versus milk, this being caused by significant increases in both Ig and casein content.2 The crude fat content of first milking Holstein colostrum (6.7%) is also significantly higher than for milk (3.6%).15 Energy from fat and lactose in colostrum is critical for thermogenesis and body temperature regulation.

In order to achieve the more ambitious goals for excellent passive transfer, presented later in this article, the authors estimate that producers need to deliver greater than or equal to 300 g of IgG shortly after birth. The 2 major factors affecting the mass of Ig consumed are the quality and volume of colostrum fed. Factors affecting the absorption of Ig molecules into circulation include the quickness with which the first colostrum feeding is provided after birth, bacterial contamination of colostrum, and metabolic status of the calf. This article next discusses these key factors, strategies for minimizing bacterial contamination of colostrum, the use of colostrum supplements (CSs) and replacers, benefits of multiple feedings, and benefits of extended colostrum or transition milk feeding after intestinal closure.",

Although some studies have reported that exposure to high ambient temperatures during late pregnancy is associated with poorer colostrum composition, including lower mean concentrations of colostral IgG and IgA,49, 58 others have reported the opposite.46 It has been suggested that any negative effects of heat stress on colostrum quality might be associated with reduced dry matter intake or reduced mammary blood flow resulting in impaired transfer of IgG and nutrients to the udder.58 Season may also have an impact on colostrum yield, although this is less well described. In a year-long study of a 2500-cow Jersey dairy in Texas, colostrum yield was highest in June but declined during the fall and winter months.59 A low-temperature humidity index and a shortened photoperiod 1 month before and at calving were both highly correlated with reduced colostrum yield. The investigators hypothesized that shortened photoperiod may reduce colostrum production because of its impact on melatonin and prolactin, hormones known to be involved with colostrogenesis. However, a study that experimentally manipulated photoperiod reported no effect of photoperiod during the dry period on colostrum quality or yield.60 Producers should adopt heat-abatement strategies for prepartum cows and heifers and are advised to bank frozen colostrum to meet needs during low colostrum production months.59\n",

However, factors such as content of fat and colostrum temperature affect the hydrometer reading.73 More recently, several studies have validated use of the Brix refractometer, an instrument that measures percentage solids in a solution, to indirectly estimate IgG level in colostrum. The Brix refractometer is less affected by temperature and more durable than the glass colostrometer. Studies have reported that a value between 18% and 23% Brix is an appropriate cut point for determining good-quality colostrum (IgG >50 g/L).74, 75, 76, 77 An achievable herd-level goal is to harvest high-quality colostrum (IgG \u226550 g/L or Brix \u226522%) in greater than or equal to 90% of samples tested.",

In one study, mean serum IgG level at 24 hours was significantly higher for calves fed 4 L of colostrum at 0 hours and a further 2 L at 12 hours (serum IgG = 31.1 g/L) compared with calves fed only 2 L of high-quality colostrum at 0 hours and a further 2 L at 12 hours (serum IgG = 23.5 g/L).78 Another study reported that Brown Swiss calves fed 3.8 L (vs 1.9 L) of colostrum at first feeding experienced significantly higher rates of average daily gain and greater levels of milk production in both the first and second lactations.8 The method of delivering colostrum deserves consideration. Suckling the dam is the least preferred approach, because delays in suckling and failure to control quality and volume ingested can result in higher rates of FPT.79 When colostrum is delivered with an esophageal tube feeder, the esophageal groove reflex is not triggered, resulting in fluid being deposited into the forestomachs. However, this is not a significant limitation because outflow of colostrum from the forestomachs to the abomasum and small intestine occurs for the most part within 3 hours.80 As such, equal and acceptable levels of passive transfer are achieved when colostrum is delivered by nipple bottle or esophageal tube feeder, provided that a sufficient volume of colostrum is delivered.81, 82 One study reported that calves drinking from a nipple bottle consumed an average of only 2.2 L (range, 1\u20134 L).83 As such, producers feeding colostrum by nipple bottle should be prepared to deliver any remaining colostrum using a tube feeder, or provide a second bottle feeding within 6 hours, for those calves that do not voluntarily consume their whole allotment. Veterinarians should train staff on how to safely administer colostrum using tube feeders. Equipment sanitation and maintenance are important for both bottles and tube feeders.",

There is no added benefit of feeding CS if already feeding 3 to 4 L of high-quality maternal colostrum.116 By comparison, CR products are designed to completely replace maternal colostrum. They should provide a minimum of 100 g of IgG per pack and should also provide sufficient levels of nutrients to the calf to support metabolic needs in the first day of life. In Canada and the United States, CS and CR products may be licensed through the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Canadian Center for Veterinary Biologics (Ottawa, ON), or through the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB; Ames, IA), respectively. In addition to other requirements, licensed products must originate from bovine colostrum; must be processed using accepted protocols to guarantee efficacy, safety, purity, and potency (minimum IgG content); and every serial made for sale and distribution must be tested for purity and potency.117, 118 Many products that are not CVB-licensed are produced in the United States, using a variety of manufacturing techniques, and with Ig sources including spray-dried bovine colostrum, milk, whey, bovine serum, or plasma. Nonlicensed products are not legally able to claim to supply IgG or to purport to be used for the prevention of FPT, although their use for this purpose is widespread in the United States.",

Many products provide only 100 to 150 g of IgG per pack, although some products provide label directions that suggest feeding increased masses of IgG, at the discretion of the producer. Although not true of all products, studies have shown that several commercially available CR products, when administered at a high enough IgG mass (150\u2013200 g of IgG) within a few hours after birth, can provide acceptable serum IgG concentrations when using a conventional goal for APT (eg, \u226590% of calves with serum IgG \u226510 g/L).119, 120, 121, 122 However, if producers hope to achieve the more ambitious goals for passive transfer that are proposed in relation to monitoring, the authors suggest that they may need to deliver at least 300 g of IgG in a CR product. Research is required to investigate this hypothesis. Apart from dose, there can also be differences among CR products in Ig absorption, with studies generally reporting greater AEA percentage for lacteal-derived CR compared with serum-derived or plasma-derived CR.123, 124 Because of variable performance among products, veterinarians should review results of peer-reviewed controlled trials when recommending CR products to producers.",

Other analytes, such as serum total protein (STP), have been extensively validated, are easily measured at the farm level, and are more economical than measuring IgG directly.125, 126 STP levels in healthy calves should be evaluated from blood samples collected from 24 hours after the first colostrum feeding to 10 days of age.127 The earlier in this sampling window that samples are collected, the more accurately the results reflect true IgG absorption and the less likely it is for results to be influenced by IgG distribution/decay or dehydration. The use of a standard optical refractometer to measure STP or an optical or digital Brix refractometer, both of which are field friendly, is becoming more common.

From a study by Calloway and colleagues,128 Tyler proposed (Personal Communication, 2002) that a successful passive transfer program was one in which 90% of sampled calves test 5.0 to 5.2 g/dL or higher.132 However, one concern with this approach to setting goals includes the notion that \u201cfailure\u201d should be used to describe calves with no measurable IgG, whereas \u201cadequate\u201d does not convey whether an optimal amount of IgG has been absorbed by the calf. In addition, a single cutoff that expresses failure versus adequate passive transfer is too simplistic, because it fails to recognize that increasing concentrations of IgG or STP are associated with reducing morbidity risk and improved calf performance. Studies by Furman-Fratczak and colleagues13 and Windeyer and colleagues12 showed that dairy calves with serum IgG levels greater than or equal to 15 g/L and STP greater than or equal to 5.7 g/dL, respectively, experienced lower rates of respiratory disease. In beef calves, Dewell and colleagues133 reported lower morbidity rates when serum IgG level was greater than or equal to 24 g/L. Based on these and other studies, including the USDA National Animal Health Monitoring System\u2019s Dairy 2014 study,4, 46 a reevaluation of the FPT individual and herd-based cut points was conducted. A group of calf experts from the United States and Canada convened in 2018 to review and propose revised individual and herd-based evaluation standards. The proposed consensus standard is based on the association of lower morbidity and higher values of serum IgG, because mortality risk is associated with serum IgG values less than 10 g/L. The proposed standard includes 4 categories: excellent, good, fair, and poor. These categories can be applied to individual calves and to the operation for herd-based evaluation based on the percentage of calves that should be represented in each category (Table 2\n). Because serum IgG level is not commonly measured, equivalent STP and Brix levels are provided for the 4 categories. The proposed consensus standard is meant to set higher goals for calf health in the US dairy industry.",

As such, the STP and Brix cut points suggested for monitoring passive transfer in calves fed maternal colostrum are frequently inaccurate for calves fed CR. Veterinarians are encouraged to use STP or serum Brix measures to monitor the effectiveness of a CR feeding program only if independently conducted studies are available describing the relationship between STP or serum Brix measures and serum IgG for the specific commercial CR product in use on the farm. If this information is not available for specific CR products, veterinarians are advised to periodically submit frozen serum samples for laboratory analysis of IgG using direct methods such as RID.",

Although good progress has been made in the past 20 years, there remains a considerable opportunity for many dairy producers to improve their colostrum management practices, resulting in improved short-term and long-term health and performance of the animals. Producers should provide calves with a sufficient volume of clean, high-quality colostrum within the first few hours of life. Additional benefits may be captured by providing multiple feedings and by extended feeding of colostrum or transition milk after gut closure. Colostrum replacers are useful tools if clean, high-quality maternal colostrum is not available. Ongoing monitoring helps producers to more quickly identify and correct problems within the colostrum management program.",
