Since then, numerous studies have evaluated this relationship, although the different methodologies employed made it difficult to draw conclusions that definitively proved this association. However, more recently, several prospective studies, now considered seminal,23, 24, 25, 26, 27 showed that a history of bronchiolitis caused by RSV is an independent risk factor for the development of recurrent wheezing and medically-diagnosed asthma. Of these authors, Sigurs et al.27 performed the longest follow-up to date, with subjects reaching the age of 18 years in the last follow-up time point. The initial cohort consisted of 47 infants aged <1 year hospitalized with severe RSV bronchiolitis and 93 age- and gender-matched controls. Children who had been admitted for bronchiolitis had a higher prevalence of asthma/recurrent wheezing and allergic sensitizations at the ages of 3, 7 and 13 years, compared to the control group. At the age of 18, the bronchiolitis group maintained a significantly higher prevalence of asthma (39% vs 9%), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (43% vs 17%), and perennial allergen sensitization (41% vs 14%). Moreover, at the age of 18, the bronchiolitis group had poorer lung function (FEV1, FEV1/FVC) than the control group, irrespective of whether they had concomitant asthma or not. They also had more prevalent bronchial hyperresponsiveness and bronchodilator response. Finally, the authors reported that the only 2 risk factors independently related with the diagnosis of asthma at 18 years of age were a history of severe RSV bronchiolitis and presence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. These results show that severe RSV bronchiolitis in the early months of life is associated with the development of asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and allergic sensitization, and suggest that this association continues until adulthood.",

Investigators measured lung function and response to methacholine of infants at 1 month of life, before any respiratory symptom had been observed. They found at this time point that children who subsequently developed severe bronchiolitis already had bronchial hyperresponsiveness as a precursor to bronchiolitis.46 These results are supported by the recent COAST study, which identified allergic sensitization in the first year of life as a significant risk factor for virus-associated wheezing, while wheezing associated with respiratory infection does not increase the risk of developing allergic sensitization.47\n",
