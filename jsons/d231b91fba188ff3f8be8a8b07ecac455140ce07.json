The agent is an enveloped RNA virus with a non-segmented single-stranded negative-sense genome. The viral genome encodes 8 structural and 2 non-structural proteins. Important structural proteins include the fusion (F) protein and the attachment (G) protein which are essential for viral penetration and attachment to the host cells. Both proteins are important in development of immune responses. The virus is estimated to cause 3000 to 4000 deaths annually. Primary infections are as a rule symptomatic. The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild upper tract illness, infection in middle ear which progresses to acute otitis media, croup, to apnoea in premature infants, pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Premature babies born at 30\u221235 weeks of gestation, infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease, HIV-infected subjects, and patients on intensive immunosuppressive therapy especially after bone marrow transplant are considered to be at risk for increased mortality and morbidity during RSV infection. The virus does not normally replicate outside of the bronchopulmonary tree and the infection is exquisitely restricted to the respiratory mucosa. However, development of extrapulmonary disease has been observed in certain T and B cell immunodeficiency states. The association of RSV with asthma and reversible reactive airway disease in early childhood has attracted significant attention. Recurrent wheezing for up to 5 to 7 years of age and established airway disease has been observed in a significant number of children with a strong family history of allergy, after primary infection or reinfection with RSV. Immune response to primary infection is relatively small but on reinfection, a significant booster effect with sustained immunologic reactivity is observed in serum and respiratory mucosa. Both CD 4 -and CD 8 -specific as well as Th 1 -and Th 2 -cell specific immune responses have been observed during human infection. In addition, proinflammatory as well as immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the respiratory tract after natural and induced (in vitro) infection. Significant progress has been made in understanding the role of Th 1 vs. Th 2 , IgE, viral induced cytokines and chemokines in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the disease, development of wheezing and in the prevention and treatment of the infection and its sequelae. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the commonest human viral infections, and virtually every child is infected by the third birthday. Because of its restricted mucosal immunopathology, and frequent association with bronchial hyperreactivity and development of wheezing, RSV has served as an important model to investigate mechanisms of mucosal immune responses and development of mucosal disease following infection. The importance of RSV in bronchopulmonary disease and development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been the focus of several recent symposia [Kimpen JL, Simoes EAF. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001; 163:S1\u2212S6]. This brief report will only summarise, based on selected references, the historical landmarks of its discovery and current understanding of the mechanisms of immunity, and their possible role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "S120 P.L. OGRA", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "RSV was discovered in 1956, when a group of chimpanzees in a colony outside of Washington, DC (USA) were noted to have developed cold-like illness. Morris and colleagues recovered a cytopathic agent from one of these chimpanzees, who had an upper respiratory tract illness with coryza, runny nose, and malaise. They named this agent \"chimpanzee coryza agent\"(CCA). 2 These investigators examined the entire colony, and nearly 100% of the chimpanzees were found to be infected. An interesting observation was that the human contacts working with the chimpanzees were also infected and exhibited mild upper respiratory tract illness and coryza, somewhat less severe than observed in the chimpanzees. Subsequent studies identified two major isolates of the virus recovered from other patients with upper respiratory tract illnesses. The Long strain, commonly used in laboratory studies, was recovered from the bronchopulmonary washings of a child with bronchopneumonia, and the Schneider strain was recovered from a patient with croup. 3, 4 On the basis of the cytopathology of this agent in tissue culture with formation of syncytia, and the similarities between the isolates recovered from the monkeys and the Long and the Schneider strains recovered in humans, Chanock and colleagues coined the term \"respiratory syncytial virus\" to incorporate all available isolates, and provided a classic description of the disease in children. 3, 4 Shortly thereafter, Beem and colleagues described in detail the epidemiology of RSV infection during community outbreaks. 5 The agent is a pleomorphic, enveloped, cytoplasmic virus containing single-stranded, negativesense RNA. The RNA is associated with viral proteins, consisting of a nucleocapsid core that is packaged within a lipid envelope. RSV is classified in the genus Pneumovirus, which belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae. The Paramyxoviridae family also includes two other genera, Paramyxovirus (containing, e.g., parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 and mumps virus) and Morbillivirus. The genera are differentiated by the diameter of the helix, the number of genes, and the nature of their surface glycoproteins. The surface G glycoprotein of the virus lacks neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. Complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning has identified ten different viral genes, each coding for a single protein. The sequences of each gene have been described. The characteristics of these genes differentiate RSV from the other members of Paramyxoviridae as reviewed previously. 6 Eight of the ten RSV proteins are present in infected cells and in the virions, and therefore are structural proteins. The disulfide-bonded glycoprotein (F, fusion protein) and the large glycoprotein (G, attachment protein) are surface proteins and are the major antigenic determinants of the virus. These proteins induce protective antibodies. The G protein mediates viral attachment. The F protein mediates viral penetration and syncytium formation. The small hydrophobic protein (SH), the matrix protein (M), and the M2 protein are envelope-associated proteins. The nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), and the large nucleoprotein (L) are present in the RSV nucleocapsid. NS1 and NS2 are non-structural proteins; they are found only in infected cells but not in virions. 6 RSV displays minimal antigenic heterogeneity. However, two major groups A and B, with antigenic differences on the G, F, N, and P proteins, have now been identified. The G protein is the most variable protein, with only 53% homology in the amino-acid sequences between the proteins of the A and B groups. In contrast, the F and N proteins have a high degree of genetic and antigenic homology between the two groups. Both F and G proteins have several distinct antigenic sites. 6 Recent data have shown considerable genetic diversity among groups A and B. The G-protein sequences may differ 20% in different group-A lineages and 9% in different group-B lineages.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 365, "end": 366, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1035, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1037, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1434, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1436, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1560, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2521, "end": 2522, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3303, "end": 3304, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3782, "end": 3783, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE VIRUS"}, {"text": "The replication of the virus includes the following specific events.

Consequently, these patients need longer hospitalisation. 10 Some studies suggest that intubation increases the risk for fatal illness. RSV infection is a major reason for re-hospitalisation of children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In these patients, a large number of siblings, parental smoking and recent need for home oxygen therapy are major risk factors. 6 Clinicians have long been aware that RSV infection may be particularly severe, long lasting, and sometimes fatal in children with congenital immunodeficiency diseases, especially those with both T-and B-cell defects. Animal studies have suggested that T-cell mediated cellular immunity is responsible for terminating RSV infection. No reports are available of possible increased severity of RSV disease in children with isolated hypogammaglobulinemia. Increased morbidity and mortality have, however, been documented in children undergoing chemotherapy. Severe RSV infection has been reported in children who underwent liver transplantation. The risk factors appeared to be acquisition of infection soon after transplantation and pre-existing lung disease. 10 Recently, RSV infection has been studied in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children who experienced pneumonia and prolonged viral carriage. Up to 25% of such children may develop fatal illness. 10, 11 Congenital heart disease is another well-established risk factor for severe RSV infection.

These include anatomic restrictions of the neonatal bronchial tree, and tissue damage produced by the infection itself as a result of direct cytopathology of the mucosa. During the course of acute infection, there is sloughing of the respiratory epithelium with exposure and activation of irritant receptors, which induce neurogenic stimulation of bronchial smooth muscle and development of bronchial spasm. There is loss of inhibitory mediators and cholinergic neural activity as observed during parainfluenza and influenza virus infections. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that RSV significantly augments the proinflammatory effects of substance P by upregulating the expression and density of its specific receptor NK1 on target cells. Substance P is a neuropeptide which has been shown to exhibit significant bronchoconstrictor effects in experimental animal studies. 17 Because of the anatomy of airway in the neonate, these neurogenic factors may be more important in the induction of bronchial hyperreactivity in early infancy and childhood than later in life. 17 There is good evidence from both clinical studies and experimental models with RSV, that early respiratory infections may contribute to early systemic sensitisation to other antigens or allergens in a genetically prone or atopic child (Table 2) . Such children may start building up homocytotropic immune responses to environmental allergens very early on in life. 18, 19 Antibody-mediated immune responses are to a large extent protective. IgG, IgA and IgM do not seem to contribute to the development of disease. In fact, they seem to be important in protection. High levels of maternal antibody are indeed protective against disease. However, the magnitude of such immune response in the early years is low. It has been observed that the primary immune responses against RSV are relatively ineffective, S124 P.L.

Such IgE activity is predominantly cell-bound to the mucosal epithelial of the respiratory tract. 20 In general, there is not much free IgE detectable in respiratory excretions, unless children are wheezing or they have bronchiolitis or pneumonia. It seems that most children produce IgE to RSV early in life, but it is the amount, the persistence and the duration of this response which is critical in determining which patients are going to develop bronchiolitis and wheezing. It has been observed that persistent virus-specific IgE response in respiratory mucosa is an important element in the development of immunopathology for both RSV and parainfluenza viruses. 20 In the last decade there has been considerable interest in examining the role of cell-mediated immune responses in the mechanism of immunopathology in the respiratory tract. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cells and Th 1 and Th 2 types of CD4+ cells have been implicated in the development of disease especially during RSV, rhinovirus and influenza virus infections. 1, 18, 19 In addition to IgE antibodies and their interaction with mast cells and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators, the interaction between RSV and the respiratory epithelium also results in the release of several other mediators. These proteins are very important in mobilising other cells to the site of disease. Studies conducted by our group during the past decade have demonstrated the release of leukotrienes, eosinophil degranulation byproducts and epithelial cell-derived cytokines and chemokines during the course of RSV infection in in vitro and/or in vivo settings. 20\u221223 There is a wide spectrum of cytokines, chemokines and arachidonic acid metabolites, which are generated during the course of RSV infection. Many of these products are critical in recruiting cells to the site of disease. Furthermore, during the course of infection, there is induction of several cell-adhesion molecules and homing ligands (CD11B, ICAM-1, E-selectin) necessary for inflammatory and immune cells to be mobilised to the site of disease, to rollover, bind, and stick to the virus-infected tissues. They also induce expression of antigen-presenting molecules like HLA class I and II. Thus, there is a complex array of events set in motion by RSV infection of respiratory epithelium, which mobilise inflammatory and possibly immunoregulatory cells to the site of disease in the mucosal epithelium. 24 Considering the large number of mechanisms proposed as explanations for the disease caused by the virus it is important to attempt to separate the primary cause and the subsequent effects of specific cell-virus interactions in mucosal tissues. Is RSV disease a true consequence of all these different pathogenic mechanisms proposed, or are they set in motion as a result of the activation of different immunoregulatory pathways during the replication of the virus in the mucosa? Studies to date have identified a number of other viral-or host-induced events during RSV-associated clinical disease. Clearly, all these events cannot be the cause of the disease seen after infection with RSV. In order to provide a unifying base to the multiplicity of phenomena observed, it has been proposed that RSV infection may trigger the activation of a \"master switch\" of genetic control, regulating the expression of one or more cellular functions identified above.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 163, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 422, "end": 424, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 992, "end": 994, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1351, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1355, "text": "18,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1358, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2758, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Children"}, {"text": "Previous studies in molecular biology have described in detail the role of transcription factors in activating certain genes or groups of genes. There are a number of nuclear factors, which mobilise gene activation processes and activate many cellular functions. RSV has been shown to induce activation of several such transcription factors. Recently Garafalo et al. and others have shown that RSV activates the gene promoters for NF-IL-6 and NF-\u00faB. Such transcription factors regulate the synthesis of a variety of cytokines and chemokines and other important immunomodulating proteins. These include TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, GM-CSF, and G-CSF; adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VICAM-1 and E-selectin; and chemokines, IL-8, MIP-1a, MCP-1, and eotaxin. These molecules are important in initiating the inflammatory cascade and in mobilising cells to the site of disease. 24, 25 It appears that RSV, during the course of replication at the level of the cell, initiates activation of certain transcription processes which may have a profound effect on expression of many mediators of immunoregulation and inflammation. Other viruses such as influenza, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses have been shown to induce a similar activity. Recent studies suggest that the ultimate expression of allergy involves a multiplicity of genetic and environmental factors. Failure to switch off expected Th2 phenotype may be a key factor in eventual development of allergic sensitisation. A number of other environmental factors in early infancy and childhood may also determine the outcome of allergic sensitisation by shifting cellular immune response towards immunologic hyperactivity (Table 3).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 865, "end": 868, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 869, "end": 871, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Children"}, {"text": "It is thus proposed that a balance between the expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the development of Th 1 vs Th 2 or CD 4 vs CD 8 cellular response following RSV infection may ultimately determine the degree of pathology or the level of protection against bronchopulmonary disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Children"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Respiratory syncytial virus and reactive airway disease", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Kimpen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Eaf", "middle": [], "last": "Simoes", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2001, "venue": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "volume": "163", "issn": "", "pages": "1--6", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Recovery of cytopathogenic agent from chimpanzees with coryza", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Morris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Blount", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Savage", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1956, "venue": "Proc Soc Exp Biol Med", "volume": "92", "issn": "", "pages": "544--549", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Recovery from infants with respiratory illness of virus related to chimpanzee coryza agent (CCA): I.
