The novel coronavirus is now referred to as severe and critical acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted through respiratory tract and could induce pneumonia (Chen, et al. 2020; Chu, et al. 2020). By 6 April, WHO has reported of 1, 210, 956 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 67,594 deaths worldwide (WHO, 2020). The current outbreaks of coronavirus infection remind us that CoVs are still a severe and critical threats to global public health.",

Thus, the best way to deal with severe and critical infections of SARS-CoV-2 is to control the source of infection, early diagnosis, quarantine and supportive treatments. It is difficult for physicians to distinguish causative agents without a laboratory diagnosis due to the similar clinical presentations of different pathogens. Therefore, the fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are particularly important for patients. However, most studies only focused on SARS-CoV-2, while the co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been somewhat neglected. Co-infection with certain pathogens may also hinder accurate disease diagnosis. Wang et al. presented the latest status of the SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in China and added details on combined bacterial and fungal infections (Wang, et al. 2020). However, the types of co-infected pathogens and the proportion of co-infection in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients are unclear. In this study, the clinical features of COVID-19 patients were analyzed, then 39 respiratory pathogens in their throat swab were detected by specific real-time RT-PCR. This study will provide a reference for epidemic prevention and clinical treatment in Wuhan and other areas combating this epidemic.",

In our study, 94.2 % of COVID-19 patients could be co-infected with one or more other pathogens, including 9 viruses, 11 bacteria and 4 fungi. There was no death of all the cases. Only 3 patients were admitted to the ICU. The proportions of the co-infection had no statistical significant difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. The results suggested that there was no specific relationship between co-infection and ICU admission, as well as the occurrence of death. The prognosis of patients with co-infection needs to be further studied.",

            "text": "Bacterial co-infection in the setting of viral pneumonia is known as major cause of mortality (Guo, et al. 2019). Our results showed that bacterial co-infection were dominant in all COVID-19 patients. S.pneumoniae, KP, and Hi were the most common bacterial co-infection in our study. Although some of them are co-colonization, they are conditional pathogen. They might also pathogenic when the immune function of COVID-19 patients were decreased. It suggested that pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines would offer an effective approach to preventing the most common co-infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to bacteria, fungi was also a major factor of co-infection secondary to viral infections such as seen in influenza infection in which A. baumannii, Aspergillus, Candida and KP were discovered as common secondary infections (Gao, et al. 2013; Guo, et al. 2019). In this study, the highest rates of co-infection with bacteria and fungi were found among severe and critical category. Some of pathogens are known antibiotic resistance which may make the treatment of COVID-19 patients more difficult. Wang et al. studied 104 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that 3 (2.88 %) patients were co-infected with other coronavirus, 2 (1.94 %) were co-infected with influenza A (Wang, et al. 2020). In this study, we also found a few of influenza A, influenza B co-infections, but no coronavirus was detected. These results indicated that the co-infections with influenza A, influenza B or coronavirus were not common in COVID-19 patients, though the seasonal influenza is now prevalent. However, influenza A, influenza B co-infections may increase the risks of COVID-19 patients. Influenza vaccination is still recommended. It was notable that the positive rates of HAdV and HRV were higher than that of influenza viruses. HAdV and HRV are associated with lower mortality, but significant higher morbidity, causing a huge economic burden (Fendrick, et al. 2003). EBV and HSV were the common pathogens carried by adults. The effects of their roles in the process of COVID-19 need to be explored. CMV, HBoV, and HMPV were important pathogens of respiratory tract infection in children. However, only a few of them were found co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The virus co-infection could cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and demonstrate overlapped clinical presentations. Thus, other viruses should also be considered while diagnosing and treating SARS-CoV-2.",

We also found that the rates of influenza, HRV, and HAdV co-infection were higher among cases of 15\u201364 years old which was different from the previous studies in which the pathogens were found mainly affecting the young and aged people. It may be due to the decreased immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The highest Co-infection rate and the most pathogen species were detected in cases of 1\u20134 days after onset. Along with the course of disease, both the rates and pathogen species of co-infection among COVID-19 patients were decreased significantly, which may due to the treatment the patients received. We noticed that a high co-infection rate and pathogen species in patients of -4\u20130 days after onset, which indicated asymptomatic category also have high co-infection opportunity although the pathogen species was the lowest, and early treatment should be taken for them.
