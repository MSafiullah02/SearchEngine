But the clinical manifestations in this couple were not exactly the same. On admission, beside fever, the male was predominately manifested by dyspnea and only had mild abnormality in routine urine and stool test results, while the female had obvious gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. These suggest this virus may be present in urine and stools, but we did not run pathogen isolation and detection, and it is only presumption. As for why the male had only abnormality in urine and stools rather than gastrointestinal symptoms, while the female had no abnormality in urine or stools but had gastrointestinal symptoms on the contrary, we have no definite explanation. Before the onset, the couple went to a restaurant one stop away from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market to eat frozen seafood. Maybe they get sick after being exposed to the same pathogen. The male developed symptoms first and had more severe clinical symptoms, which may be related to his immunity was better than the female. After the first exposure to the virus, patients with better immunity have stronger body reactions. Innate immune cells play a vital role in effective host responses to various pathogens. Neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages are the major innate immune cells that coordinate innate immunity against viral lung infections. Respiratory viruses can inhibit the innate immune response, and consequently obtain effective opportunities for virus replication and infection. The affected innate immune response also affects subsequent adaptive immune responses; so, viral innate immune evasion often disrupts the complete protective immunity (Kikkert 2020 ). Therefore, initially, of the two patients, the female had normal neutrophilic granulocytes initially, and both had normal monocytes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1926, "end": 1939, "text": "(Kikkert 2020", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16 ? 56 cells were all decreased in both patients.

On January 5, 2020, the female' conditions were improved, but the CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells declined further. Perhaps the female patient recalled more immune cells to participate in the antiviral process in her body.
