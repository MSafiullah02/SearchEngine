            "text": "It is well known that factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates have revolutionized the treatment of patients with haemophilia, with considerable improvements in patients\u2019 quality of life [1, 2]. The transmissions of hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), non\u2010A\u2013non\u2010B hepatitis [3, 4] and HIV [5, 6] were significant setbacks. Many preventive measures were implemented to reduce the risk of viral transmission by transfusion and plasma products, including donor screening, virucidal procedures [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and virus eradication steps in manufacturing. For example, in 1985, Bio Products Laboratory (BPL) introduced an intermediate\u2010purity FVIII/von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrate (8Y) manufactured using a dry heat\u2010treatment at 80\u00b0C for 72 h [10, 11, 12], which is known to have broad antiviral effect [10, 13]. Over the last 20 years, 8Y has been well tolerated in the treatment of haemophilia A and von Willebrand disease (VWD), without any transmission of hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C or HIV, and with a low incidence of inhibitors [14, 15, 16].",

In addition, the specific and well\u2010established solvent\u2013detergent step is included, to minimize transmission of enveloped viruses, including West Nile [17, 18]. The dry heating (80\u00b0C for 72 h) process, used in 8Y, and known to inactivate SARS virus [19], has been retained. The two specific virucidal steps taken in the manufacture of Optivate\u00ae are considered effective against enveloped and non\u2010enveloped viruses (e.g. HAV and parvovirus B19). The normal pharmacokinetics of Optivate\u00ae have been reported elsewhere in patients with haemophilia A [20] and in patients with VWD [21].",

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, two outbreaks of inhibitors amongst previously treated patients (PTPs) treated with new concentrates showed that changes in manufacturing processes could result in the formation of neoantigens leading to inhibitor formation [22, 23, 24, 25]. Since then, it has been essential to evaluate all new FVIII concentrates in PTPs to establish whether they are unusually antigenic.",

As the formation of inhibitors currently represents a major obstacle to successful treatment in some patients with haemophilia A, the absence of inhibitors in these trials with Optivate\u00ae further supports its use in clinical practice, although all patients were PTPs.
