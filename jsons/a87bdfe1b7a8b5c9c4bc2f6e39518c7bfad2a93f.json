Clinical examination confirmed anterior uveitis and immature cataract in the right eye and chorioretinitis in the left eye. Ocular ultrasound showed a retinal detachment in the right eye. Diagnostic testing revealed elevated serum titers for Toxoplasma gondii . Anterior uveitis in the right eye and chorioretinitis in the left eye progressed, resulting in blindness despite a 21-day course of clindamycin and aggressive topical medical management of uveitis. The right eye was enucleated and histopathologic evaluation of the globe revealed panuveitis and multiple organisms morphologically consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum . Systemic treatment with itraconazole was initiated. Vision returned after 3 months of treatment and complete resolution of the retinal hemorrhages with formation of a flat chorioretinal scar was noted after 6 months of therapy. Itraconazole was discontinued 7 months after starting therapy, at which time the funduscopic appearance of the chorioretinal scar had remained static for 1 month. The cat has remained visual without evidence of disease progression for 6 months following discontinuation of itraconazole.",

Dazzle reflex was present OU. Direct and indirect pupillary light reflexes were normal OS, but reduced OD. Abnormalities noted on slit-lamp biomicroscopy included moderate diffuse corneal edema, keratic precipitates, 2/4 aqueous flare 1 with anterior chamber cell, rubeosis iridis, and an immature anterior cortical cataract with pigmented cells adherent to the anterior lens capsule OD. Biomicroscopic examination results were normal OS. Schirmer I tear test values were within the reference range OU (11 mm/min OD and 10 mm/min OS). [2] [3] [4] Applanation tonometry (Tonopen-XL \u00ae , Mentor O & O Inc., Norwell, MA, USA) with topical anesthesia revealed hypotony OD (4 mmHg) and normal intraocular pressure OS (13 mmHg). [5] [6] [7] Neither cornea retained fluorescein stain. Indirect ophthalmoscopy, following mydriasis OU (1% tropicamide, Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals, Tampa, FL, USA) identified a focal, raised, mottled, brown, hyporeflective chorioretinal lesion within the lateral midperipheral tapetal fundus OS measuring 4 optic disk diameters (DD) horizontally, and 4.5 DD vertically (Fig. 1) . Multifocal white, strand-like vitreal opacities ranging from 0.25 to 1 DD in size were closely associated with the chorioretinal lesion. Funduscopic examination OD was impossible because of extensive corneal opacities and cataract. Marked anterior uveitis, immature cataract and blindness OD, and chorioretinitis with associated vitritis OS were diagnosed based upon ophthalmic examination findings and history.",

Based on history, clinical signs, serum antibody titers, and failure to demonstrate other etiologies, this cat's uveitis initially was attributed to toxoplasmosis. The presence of positive serum antibody titers to T. gondii and correlation between titer and uveitis are controversial in cats without systemic signs of infection. However, seroprevalence of T. gondii is higher in cats with anterior uveitis than in those without anterior uveitis. 28 In this case, detection of decreasing serum T. gondii IgM antibody titer after administration of clindamycin suggested the presence of active toxoplasmosis at the initial presentation. Although this patient had an IgM/IgG C-value of < 1, which is inconsistent with ocular toxoplasmosis, this was calculated using samples collected following administration of prednisolone. Therefore, this test result cannot be accurately interpreted because glucocorticoid administration can significantly decrease intraocular T. gondii -specific antibody production. 21 Also, the effect on C-value of surgical manipulation of the globe, in this case prior to collection of aqueous humor, is unknown. Failure to amplify T.-gondii DNA from the subretinal fluid of the patient could be interpreted to mean that T. gondii was not involved with the ocular disease. 29 However, PCR results using aqueous humor are commonly negative in cats with experimentally induced T.-gondii infection and validation of this assay for subretinal fluid has not been performed. In addition, it is possible that this cat was infected with both T. gondii and fungus and that, while clindamycin administration led to the negative T.-gondii PCR result, ocular inflammation persisted because of the fungal infection. Unfortunately, ocular tissue was not later available for determination of the presence of T.-gondii DNA.",

Although H.-capsulatum antibody production was not observed in this case, false-negative serologic tests have been reported in feline histoplasmosis. 24 An antigen test also was negative. The H.-capsulatum antigen detection test is most sensitive in human patients with disseminated or acute pulmonary histoplasmosis 30 and false negatives are common in experimental subjects with a low fungal burden. 31 Although this case did not appear to have disseminated fungal disease or a large fungal load, the diagnosis of ocular histoplasmosis could not be excluded on the basis of this negative result. The negative PCR result for H.-capsulatum DNA on the fixed enucleated eye of this cat was an interesting finding. As PCR methods for identifying H.-capsulatum DNA are not currently validated or accepted as accurate in human or veterinary patients, clinical interpretation of this result was difficult. 31 Molecular diagnostic methods such as PCR are thought to be the most sensitive tests for identification of many infectious organisms. However, in mice affected with histoplasmosis, PCR evaluation for H. capsulatum was not significantly more sensitive than silver stains for identification of the organism. 32 Also, fixation of the tissue may have caused DNA denaturation and crosslinking, resulting in the absence or significant reduction of extracted DNA. The possibility that an unknown fungal organism morphologically similar to H. capsulatum caused ocular disease in this patient also exists. Diagnosis by isolation of the organism from cultures provides the strongest evidence for infection with H. capsulatum in humans and animals. 31 Unfortunately, fungal culture was not performed in this case because fixation of tissue made culture impossible following histopathologic identification of fungal organisms.",

This presentation was unusual because of limited evidence of disseminated disease and lack of evidence of respiratory disease. In reported cases of feline ocular histoplasmosis, respiratory disease is usually concurrent. 25,37-39 A retrospective study of deep mycotic infections in cats indicated that patients with limited focal disease (cutaneous or ocular) at presentation often had disseminated infections at necropsy. 35 Three different forms of ocular disease due to H. capsulatum have been reported in humans. 40 The most common form is called presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome and consists of choroidal scarring, peripapillary atrophy, and choroidal neovascularization with absence of systemic symptoms. 41 The other two forms are usually seen in immunocompromised individuals and manifest as solitary chorioretinal granuloma or endophthalmitis with diffuse uveal and retinal involvement from disseminated histoplasmosis. 40 Ocular disease in this cat was similar to the endophthalmitis form OD and solitary granuloma form OS. Immunosuppressive factors are thought to have a minor role in predisposing cats to H.-capsulatum infection, but concurrent infection with FeLV, FIV, or FIP has been reported. 25, 35 In immunocompromised humans, opportunistic infections with H. capsulatum and T. gondii can occur in the heart, lungs, and ocular tissues.
