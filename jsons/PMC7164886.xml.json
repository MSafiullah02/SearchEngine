            "text": "In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern [1]. In response, WHO called for the implementation of risk communication and community engagement to help support efforts to combat the epidemic [1]. In the wake of the emergence of this novel virus, 80% of deaths reported in the U.S. have been in adults aged 65 years and older [2]. In addition, individuals who have serious underlying medical conditions, such as patients with cancer and particularly those receiving cancer treatment, may also be at higher risk of complications from COVID-19 [3,4]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus is thought to spread mainly through person-to-person contact from respiratory droplets [5]. To minimize infections in highly susceptible populations, such as older adults with cancer, the CDC recommends that individuals remain at home and self-isolate, wash their hands often, and avoid all non-essential travel [2]. Thus, healthcare systems have been encouraged to minimize in-person office visits for older adults, as appointments in hospitals and clinics may increase potential for exposure and infection. In an effort to abide by these guidelines while continuing to provide the essential care to those in need, telehealth has emerged as a crucial care-delivery mechanism. Implementation of telehealth care has already shown to be transformative and feasible in other areas of healthcare [6,7]. Specifically, it has been adopted to bring specialty-palliative care into the homes of seriously ill patients [8]. Similarly, many hospice agencies are offering social work support through telehealth [8].",

The UR SOCARE clinic includes a multidisciplinary team including a geriatric oncologist, advanced practice providers, resident and fellow trainees, nurse navigator (NN), physical therapist, occupational therapist (with training in cognitive assessment and interventions), pharmacist, social worker, clinical nurse, dietician, and a clinic coordinator. Typically, patients referred to the SOCARE clinic are mailed a packet ahead of the visit and are asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire prior to their appointment and bring the completed packet to the visit.

If patients agreed, the NN continued by asking an abbreviated series of questions from the GA. Selected questions were asked verbally by phone and covered all GA domains except cognition, which was assessed during the telehealth encounter (Table 1, Column 3). GA assessment measures were selected based upon brevity to minimize length of pre-visit evaluation (e.g. PHQ-2 [10] was substituted for Geriatric Depression Screen [GDS] [11]) and the reliability for use via telephone (where data were available). Questions also included all elements necessary to calculate the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) Toxicity score [12]. The NN then documented the pre-visit evaluation in the electronic medical record (EMR), including a detailed record of patients' answers to the adapted GA questions. The telephone-based pre-visit evaluation allowed for an in-depth conversation between NN and patients, and allowed for identification of areas of vulnerabilities where further attention was needed during the telehealth encounter and potential opportunities for GA-based interventions. Use of a screening tool was also considered, but the majority of patients referred to the SOCARE clinic are considered vulnerable or frail already, and the addition of a frailty screener was unlikely to provide additional information. Overall, the phone-based pre-visit evaluation took approximately 20 to 30 min.",

We elected to use a telephone-based encounter for our visits to minimize the complexity and technology needed for the encounters initially. The NN instructed patients on how to access the telemedicine encounter through a telephone dial-in process. The NN asked patients if there were any family members or caretakers who would like to call in during the appointments. If so, the NN contacted those individuals and provided the teleconference information as well. Following the pre-visit evaluation, the NN contacted the SOCARE pharmacist with the current medication list for review; any de-prescribing or pharmacy- based recommendations were then provided to the geriatric oncologist via EMR documentation to discuss further during the visit.",

Our SOCARE team wanted to continue to offer GA consultations to help with decision-making for older adults with cancer, particularly at a time when GA may provide valuable information about the potential harms and benefits of various treatment options during a pandemic. Therefore, it was imperative that our team make quick and efficient efforts to minimize older patients' trips to the hospital to lessen their exposure to COVID-19, but also to offer our consultative service for patients and the oncology community. In response to this need, the UR SOCARE team developed and implemented an adapted telehealth GA as described here.

As telehealth care becomes more widely used, it provides an important opportunity to expand telehealth care to rural patients who live a greater distance from our tertiary medical center, or to those who may have transportation or mobility limitations. We hope that sharing our experience in modifying and implementing this tool may be useful for other geriatric oncology teams and healthcare systems that are faced with similar challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
