In addition, more than one billion of the present global population of 6.8 billion is under-nourished (Mustafa, 2010). It is envisaged that global food production will have to increase by at least 40% over the next 2 decades to meet the ever increasing food demand (FAO, 2006). The way to feed the global population equitably and sustainably is in fact a great challenge in the near future (Hill and Mustafa, 2011).",

The WWF's \u2018Living Planet Report\u2019 states that global consumption of resources is 50% above Earth's sustainable ability (WWF, 2010). Furthermore, major pressures are exerted on the environment, due to continued consumerism in developed countries and growing affluence in a number of emerging economies. These led to an even higher demand of natural resources (Rockstr\u00f6m and Karlberg, 2010). Therefore, it is rather difficult to ensure sufficient food and water for all to sustain livelihoods for present and future generations (Hill and Mustafa, 2011).",

For example, the impacts of global warming on harmful algal blooms may affect the quality and safety of the aquatic products (Hallegraeff, 2014). Besides, extreme changes in climates are observed more frequently in recent years worldwide and aquaculture and agriculture are seriously affected by these extreme weathers, such as severe storms, tornados, salinity intrusions, droughts and floods (Sutradhar et al., 2015). Rising sea level can affect aquaculture in coastal areas and cause salinity intrusion into deltas which can also affect freshwater aquaculture (Edwards, 2015, Sun et al., 2015). Although efforts (such as alternative to the burning of fossil fuels, targets and agreement on reducing the carbon dioxide) have been made by developing technologies to assist sustainable development, the rate of development is insufficient to ease the immediate threats of climate change (Hill and Mustafa, 2011; Woolhouse et al., 2015).",

Exposure of PTS to the local residents was associated with a higher risk of local residents' health, such as breast cancer (odds ratio: 1.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.21\u201330.06), stomach cancer (odds ratio: 1.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.26\u201313.41), dermatitis (odds ratio: 1.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.05\u20132.80), gastroenteritis (odds ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 0.94\u20132.68), and pneumonia (odds ratio: 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.58\u20131.89).",

On the other hand the natural enemies of pests are also susceptible to pesticides, which in turn, leading to more usage of pesticides. Nutrient loss through runoff is also a problem, and it has been reported that non-point source pollution from agriculture accounts for 60\u201380% of the nutrient loading to rivers and lakes (Min and Jiao, 2002), and high nitrate concentrations in drinking water has been associated with methemoglobinemia and consequential cyanosis in infants (Fan and Steinberg, 1996). The pesticides used for reducing pests and weeds in conventional farms, together with the surplus of chemical fertilizer have led to negative impacts, causing biodiversity loss and eutrophication (Chau et al., 2015, Hortle and Bush, 2003, Richter et al., 2015), and even threats to human health (Hu et al., 2015, Jones et al., 2015, Lebov et al., 2015, Rauh et al., 119%).

Higher economic benefits have been achieved through ecological approaches via integrating with appropriate animals in these modified flooded fields. Rice-duck (Wang et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2004, Zhen et al., 2007), rice-fish (Cruz et al., 1992, Suloma and Ogata, 2006), rice-crab (Yan et al., 2014), and rice-prawn (Nair et al., 2013) farming commonly practiced in Asian countries are recognized as sustainable systems using less fertilizer and pesticide. The paddy fields or cane shoot fields provide shades, shelters and organic matters for the animals, which in turn oxygenate the soil and water, consume pests and favor nutrient recycling. These animals, especially the fish and duck are also viewed as a tool within an integrated pest management (IPM) system to make the agricultural activities more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Berg (2001) reported that approximately 65% of pesticides was decreased by the benefit of IPM on rice-fish farms during 3 years, whereas non-IPM farms had increased the amount of pesticides used by 40%. These farming patterns help the farmers to increase the revenue by limited fields. It is reported that net revenue increased from the rice\u2013fish system over the rice monoculture ranged 5%\u201311% in West Africa (Ofori et al., 2005), 47%\u201366% in Indonesia (Dwiyana and Mendoza, 2006).",

(2013) indicated that fish yield can be increased in traditional rice-fish farming system without increasing nitrogen (N) pollution and without decreasing N use efficiency, and rice yields. This could be achieved by managing the ratio of feed-N to fertilizer-N that quantities N input (with a constant input rate of 120 kg/ha). A balance will be reached with 37% fertilizer-N and 63% feed-N, while N not used by rice can be used by phytoplankton or other primary producers in the field that are subsequently consumed by the fish.",

Mulberry trees are cultivated on the pond dikes, with leaves fed to silkworms. Excreta and pupae of silkworms are added into fishponds serving as fertilizer and fish feeds respectively, and the fertile pond mud consisting of fish excreta, organic matter, and chemical elements is brought up regularly from bottom and applied as fertilizer for the mulberry trees (Zhong, 1982; Ruddle and Zhong, 1988; Wong et al., 2004).

The build-up layers of vegetation are raised 50 cm above the water level, making the Chinampas like sponges of organic earth that achieved the effective use of water surround them (Ruiz et al., 2014). Waste materials dredged from canals and surrounding cities were used to irrigate the plants. Flood tolerant trees are often planted at the corners to secure the Chinampas (Turcios and Papenbrock, 2014). Fish are raised in the canals forming islands in proximity, and the sedimentary waste from fish is collected to fertilize the crops planted on the islands. These Chinampas produce very high crop yields with four or up to seven harvests a year (Tuerenhout, 2005, Turcios and Papenbrock, 2014).",

Besides water purification, it is also used as habitat for birds and fish for ecological restoration and protection, and for developing agriculture in water for food production (Li et al., 2007, Sang and Li, 2007). Previous studies showed both terrestrial plants and aquatic plants can be cultured on floating islands as green food or safe feedstuff. These included paddy (Oryza sativa, oryza glaberrima), celery (Oenanthe javanica), goose grass (Eleusine indica), canna (Canna indica), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgali), water spinach (Nasturtium officinale), vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides), reed (Phragmites australis); the yields are generally higher than those cultured on land (Li et al., 2007). It was demonstrated that levels of heavy metals and nitrite contained in crops cultured in an eutrophic lake (Shahu Lake, Wuchang, China) by floating islands were safe for consumption. However, biological concentration of heavy metals and PTS would be a public health concern and the quality of products should be strictly controlled.",

            "text": "In general, there is a lack of effective and feasible governance tools to solve various pressing problems facing food production, especially the environmental pressures. This is especially true for environmental problems due to different PTS, threating not only food production, but also human health. Large predatory fish such as tuna, swordfish and shark containing rather high levels of mercury, hazardous to human health (especially fetus, infants and pregnant mothers), is a typical example (Ko et al., 2012). Changes have to be made concerning the patterns of living and production. Inevitably, sustainable development is highly dependent on usages of clean/green energy which is pollution-free and renewable, and operations of clean/green industries which are non-polluting without waste generation; in addition to clean/green community and individual life styles which are with high concerns and feasible governance on the ecosystem preservation and individual development (Hill and Mustafa, 2011). This can only be achieved by proper and effective management of all input and output, including wastes of individual subsystems such as urban centers, industries and food production fields. Therefore, sustainable management of food production is linked to both sustainable agriculture and sustainable aquaculture (Hill and Mustafa, 2011). Listed below are four principles involved in achieving sustainable food production, focusing on minimal environmental disturbance and safe food production management (Fig. 2).(1)Minimize input of hazardous substances. In view of bioaccumulation and biomagnification of various PTS (such as Hg, PBDEs, and DDTs) into the food production systems; the AMR problem caused by the directional selection of antibiotic; and other problems caused by the residues of pesticides and hormones, that have been threatening the human and ecosystem health, a better control of these inputs to the food production systems is highly essential. Integrated farms using strategies such as polyculture and co-culture are more efficient in using resources, with a higher total commercial income than monocultures (Nair et al., 2013, Ofori et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2003, Xi and Qin, 2009). However, serious problems are encountered, if PTS are entered into the production systems, and their concentrations are magnified due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification along the aquatic food chains (Scholz-Starke et al., 2013, Windham-Myers et al., 2014, Zald\u00edvar et al., 2011). Catastrophic loss of crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) was reported in an integrated rice-crawfish facility due to the usage of pesticides for the control of rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus) (Avault, 2001). Thus, strict management is needed to control the inputs of PTS during food production processes. The use of safe feeds (with low and acceptable levels of PTS), and bio-degradable pesticides without persistent toxic effects is also recommended.(2)Minimize negative impacts on the ecosystem. This is important to maintain a healthy environment adjacent to food production systems, by enhancing the capability of pollutant treatment, especially the wastewater pathway which is the main pathway affecting the adjacent ecosystem. This could be achieved by effective waste treatment, e.g. taking advantages of wetland and biogas techniques, by improving the structure and function of the food production systems, enhancing their capability of water purification and waste management. For instance, inclusion of the components of hydroponic, constructed treatment wetland or floating islands into aquaculture could eliminate potential eutrophication problems (Dai et al., 2006, Graber and Junge, 2009, Shutes, 2001, Yeh et al., 2015).(3)Recycle waste as resources. There is a need to recycle all wastes (e.g., sediment enriched in nutrients could be used as fertilizer) and byproducts (e.g. food processing byproducts such as bone and head of fish could be used as fish meal) generated as resources in food production systems, as much as possible. Minimizing inputs of hazardous substances would therefore ensure safer use of these wastes and byproducts. A good management of waste recycling not only minimizes pollution discharges, but also maximizes nutrient utilization, resulting in enhanced yields and economic benefits. For instance, the mud derived from aquaculture is regarded as a good \u201cslow-release\u201d fertilizer in agriculture with high concentrations of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus, which has been used to fertilize the dike and cultured mushrooms in the integrated dike-pond system (Bergheim et al., 1993, Westerman et al., 1993).(4)Select high quality production sites. The selection of high quality food production site is absolutely vital to ensure safety of food products. Currently, many sites for food production, and also water sources for food production are polluted, especially in developing countries, where factories are built in the vicinity of food production farms. Thus, insulating food production sites from polluted sites would ensure higher quality production of food items, without entry of different toxic chemicals. For instance, 8000 t of red tilapia was killed in the Chao Phraya River (Thailand) in 2007, due to the clandestine and illegal release of untreated factory effluents (Pongpao and Wipatayotin, 2007).\u201d\n",

In this regard, farming indoor would require fewer pesticides and fertilizers, which could reduce human health risks associated with high exposure to agrochemicals, comparing to open conventional farming (Graff, 2009). In fact, isolating the production sites from the pollution sources, such as air emission and waste effluent from various industries is absolutely necessary to ensure safe and quality products. For ground-based urban farming, a minimum distance is recommended between production fields and main roads to reduce the contamination of crops by lead and cadmium (S\u00e4umel et al., 2012). Suitable buffer zones should be considered as one of the components in these production systems in order to minimize potential harmful effects.",

However, when compared to the past history, the outbreak of virulent strains has become more frequent. These included H5N1 avian flu, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS), Swine influenza virus (SIV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This is likely caused by the differences in terms of food production patterns between the past and present. Rearing livestock in pens, especially under intensive farming, restricts the activity of livestock. Continual application of medications and disinfectants to maintain low pathogenic environments may have reduced the immunity of livestock and enhanced the tolerance and infectivity of pathogenic organisms. In addition, a large proportion of human population is having from many types of unhealthy habits (such as eat unhealthily, lack of exercise, irregular schedule of work and rest, live with oversized pressure), resulting a sub-health condition with low resistance, rendering themselves to become more susceptible. There were evidences of correlation between agriculture intensification and biodiversity loss and possible influences on disease emergency (Morand et al., 2014, Thongsripong et al., 2013). Thus, researches should put more focus on the therapeutic thought of increasing the resistance first, instead of extensive application of antibiotics and disinfectors.",

Another hand, how to keep our lives sustainable is becoming a big topic, as our environment has been polluted, the normal functions of our ecosystem have been disturbed, and some of the production resources are depleting, such as the non-renewable phosphate rock may be depleted in 50\u2013100 years (Cordell et al., 2009). Thus, how to produce safety food via environmentally friendly patterns would be more vital in the coming future.",

In a properly integrated food production system, nutrients and energy are continuously recycled and utilized within the system, which is also effective, in reducing pollution emissions to the adjacent environment. Integrated wetland techniques (such as hydroponic, constructed treatment wetland or floating island) with food production processes, coupled with polyculture of different fish species or other organisms (such as ducks, crabs, shrimps, and etc.), are able to promote ecosystem health, and achieve sustainability, mainly via its wastewater purification and nutrient recycling capability.",

Small-scale integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems are still widespread and of considerable importance for rural farming in some countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam (Edwards, 2015). Nevertheless, some of these existing integrated agro-ecosystems are not completely in conformity with safe food production management, or considered as environmentally friendly. Some may lack of control on waste and effluent or without proper waste and wastewater treatment, resulting in eutrophication of receiving waters. Some may lack of quality control on the additional inputs, such as using feeds contaminated with DDT and Hg. Moreover, some may lack of suitable management to isolate the production systems from the pollution sources, such as using raw and improperly treated wastewater for irrigation, uptake of pesticide residues, heavy metals and other PTS derived from contaminated soils, water, and air. Hence, smarter plans for operating the holistic production system would be important and meaningful in order to achieve sustainable living and industrial production patterns.",
