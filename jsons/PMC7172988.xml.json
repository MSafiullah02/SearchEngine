There are several explanations. Globalisation with its correspondingly increased transport of persons, products and animals can rapidly spread new infectious diseases around the world. Furthermore, the condensing of populations with world-wide urbanization and encroachment of humans into new habitats, facilitating close contact with wild animals creates new hazards for transmission of zoonotic infectious agents from animals to man and possibly in the reverse direction, transmitting human pathogens to animals [1], [2]. It has been suggested that more than 50% (868/1461) of all new human pathogens in the last century originated from an animal reservoir [3].",

The recent experience with emergence of Chikungunya virus in Italy 2007 underlines these issues. The spread of Chikungunya exemplifies how easily a well-known virus from a subtropical region in Africa is able to shift vector from one mosquito vector (Aedes aegypti) to another (Aedes albopictus), disseminate to other climatic zones \u2013 including Europe \u2013 and cause disease in a susceptible population [5]. The adaptation to a new vector can probably be ascribed to a point mutation in the virus, whereas international travel served as the means of introduction of the virus to the competent vector. A. albopictus have recently become prominent around the Mediterranean basin from Greece to Spain and other arboviral diseases including Dengue and West Nile virus may use the same vector\u2014possibly causing the next outbreak in Europe. Climate change may boost this development further by expanding the range of vectors and their capacity to spread disease, together with other activities that transfer potential vectors to new areas. A. albopictus has extended its distribution to Europe and the Americas as its larvae can be transported in used automobile tyres [6].",

The SARS epidemic was estimated to have a direct cost of 80 billion US$ in Asia, and the international community was on the verge of a true disaster of even larger dimensions. This blow could have disrupted health care services, and affected societies and economies for years. It was a fortunate coincidence that SARS was not transmissible before the onset of the patient's signs and symptoms of disease. Hence, the epidemic was contained by traditional measures of disease control such as early case finding, isolation and quarantine. If this had not been the case, the rapid development and use of an emergency vaccine might have been the only feasible measure to prevent further spread.",

These trials proved safety and efficacy, leading to licensing of the vaccine shortly after [7]. The fruit of basic immunology and vaccinology research led to the success of the vaccine and can be condensed into four major discoveries. Firstly, characterization of the poliovirus and the definition of three serotypes leading to a trivalent vaccine [8]. Secondly, pathogenicity: the discovery that poliovirus causes paralysis [9]. Thirdly, proof of principle: confirmation that neutralizing antibodies protect against disease [10] and finally, that virus could be grown in cell cultures for mass vaccine production [11]. The vaccine campaign was a huge success, and was accepted very well by the population, leading to a steep decrease in polio cases in the years immediately following the vaccine's deployment in Europe and USA. Today, polio is eradicated in most parts of the world and remains present only in a few of the poorest countries.",

One solution might be public support to public\u2013private research and development of vaccine candidates in their early preclinical/clinical phases or advance assurances of confirmed purchases of certain volumes of vaccines if they make it to licensure. The European Union has promoted the concept of public\u2013private partnerships, but this concept has not resulted in important changes so far [14]. It is important to find new ways to achieve these aims: it will be too late by the time we suddenly need new vaccines against an emerging epidemic. Public\u2013private partnerships in particular are necessary to secure vaccine production from laboratory bench through pilot plant to mass scale industrial production.

In theory, it may be possible to produce basic safety data even before a complete product is available by testing \u201cmock-up vaccines\u201d in which a placeholder antigen or antigens are used [16]. This would provide information on the safety of the delivery system including adjuvant, which is generally the most reactogenic part of a vaccine. Safety testing of a specific product would still be required, but the reactogenicity of the generic components would already be defined and be one less variable to consider in designing the vaccine. However, efficacy studies require animal models of the infection or the disease and this is both time- and money-intensive. In the absence of a defined animal model, the obvious choice is non-human primates, as the closest match to humans, but even if this is possible (i.e. the pathogen will infect primates and produce disease) it may not be practical. Both primate and non-primate animal research facilities are in short supply. Support of animal facilities is likely to pay dividends when a need arises for rapid assessment of new vaccines. This should be relatively easily put into place, by making it an explicit goal, since it is really only an expansion of existing activities by research supporting agencies. Certainly, in the United States, the biodefense initiative has led to a significant expansion in capacity. But it cannot be put into place on an ad hoc basis, nor is it likely that the private sector will become involved\u2014the return on investment in possible emerging diseases is highly uncertain.

And while phase III studies are large, they still occasionally fail to uncover rare risks, which only emerge after hundreds of thousands of people have been vaccinated, for example, intussusception of the bowel after administration of Rotashield, a vaccine to prevent diarrhoea caused by rotavirus infection [17]. Such events are only uncovered during post-licensure pharmacovigilance.",

            "text": "While it will ultimately be up to governments with WHO guidance under International Health Regulations to decide what constitutes an \u201cemergency\u201d in which it could be invoked, the bare bones of a \u201cfast-track approval\u201d system for new treatments already exists (influenza mock-up vaccines EMEA)[18], and this procedure could be expanded to accelerate vaccine-testing in clinical trials during a public health emergency. In most cases, the greatest amount of time in a clinical trial is devoted to paperwork, to ensure that the trial complies with regulations designed to minimize risk to participants, ensure transparency and provide a paper trail as a shield against future litigation, should things go awry. In diseases with a poor survival chance \u2013 aggressive cancers, for example, or anti-retroviral therapy in the early days of the HIV epidemic \u2013 regulatory agencies tended to be more forgiving. In such a situation, while safety remains a major issue (particularly for preventive vaccines administered to healthy individuals), testing for efficacy assumes greater importance.The demands for faster processing of vaccines can be addressed by the following steps:1.An already-defined regulatory framework within which fast-track clinical trials can be conducted. This should contain rules for priority review and approval, some (limited) protection against liability to open the process to commercial entities (as they are best equipped for large scale production and distribution) and rules for invoking such a process. They may not (perhaps should not) lead to open-ended approval of a product, being instead intended to allow limited release.2.Rapid access for vaccine developers to the appropriate regulatory authorities within the EMEA and authorization for regulators to draw on necessary expertise (perhaps in the form of expert panels) to enable assessments to be made quickly. Regulations on relaxing approval (perhaps in the form of approval for a limited time) for import of vaccines not currently approved for use in Europe.3.A process whereby approval can be granted under the understanding that the complete necessary paperwork can be submitted retrospectively\u2014enabling a rapid progress of efficacy trials, as soon as initial data suggests a vaccine is safe, without waiting for collation, submission and approval before progressing to the paperwork for the next step.4.A broader acceptance of surrogate data, e.g., correlates of protection and safety, in the early steps. If (for example) animal toxicity studies raise no concerns, it may be possible to proceed directly to combine phase I/II studies. This would provide human safety data, but at the cost of placing slightly more participants at risk. The payoff would be earlier access to data indicating whether the vaccine is immunogenic and stimulates the desired type of immune response, plus a more rapid assessment of vaccine safety. Acceptance of immunogenicity data as a surrogate for efficacy, based on animal models (and it is here that expert panels will be crucial) might allow rapid release of a product from phase III trials, subject to the study continuing to collect efficacy data. Such an approach could shorten vaccine-testing time by months to years.5.Finally, while it is possible to enter phase I trials with an experimental product, phase II has stricter requirements and the product tested needs to be closer to, if not identical with, that which will be taken into phase III trials\u2014which itself will be the final product. Some flexibility on vaccine composition would allow a more rapid progress to phase III.\n",

That means that without reliable surrogate markers, efficacy studies can only be done in endemic countries or selected high-risk populations. It can be expected that even in countries where the disease is endemic, people will be reluctant to accept testing of a vaccine for which safety data and approval has been fast-tracked: some form of compensation mechanism is almost certain to be required to encourage manufacturers and the public to participate in a clinical trial. This passes out of the remit of organizations such as EMEA and into that of international cooperation, which needs to be arranged at the governmental level.",

To avoid bias, such large studies are normally blinded and results assessed at the end of the study. However, in a situation where large numbers of people are being vaccinated with a \u201cfast-tracked\u201d vaccine safety concerns will be higher than normal. By putting enhanced surveillance into place and assessing data from cohorts within the main phase III study, data on adverse events possibly associated with vaccination and efficacy of the vaccine could be collected much faster. Objectivity could be maintained by maintaining blinding with regard to the study monitors. This approach essentially expands the role of the Data Safety Management Board, whose role is normally to oversee the safety of the study and who do review results on an ongoing basis, to cover decision-making on vaccine efficacy. In such a case, they would need to involve the study designers, which may raise issues of conflict of interest. This can be addressed by again involving expert review panels, but that will almost certainly face resistance from commercial developers who would face exposure of their operating procedures. But where there is an overwhelming public interest in rapid assessment of vaccine efficacy, the conventional rules may need to be relaxed and increased transparency is the safest counter to decreased regulatory oversight.",
