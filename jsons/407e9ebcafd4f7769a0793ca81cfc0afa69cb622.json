Practice guidelines for procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic are continually 122 evolving as information emerges. NAFTNet will closely monitor emerging evidence and 123 will update our guidelines accordingly (https://www.naftnet.org). 124 14. All interventional research protocols should be suspended during the pandemic. No 125 clinical benefit for the fetus or newborn is lost, because the experimental outcomes are 126 unknown. However, we encourage recruitment of pregnant women and neonates with 127 COVID-19 infection into registries which may clarify the risk of vertical transmission 128 (Table 1) . 129 15. Fetal therapy centers must carefully consider whether they can still offer certain, highly 130 resource intensive, fetal procedures, if their staffing becomes depleted, either due to 131 illness or deployment to other intensive care areas. In regions with multiple fetal therapy programs, this may be a time for collaboration, volume reduction, and/or referral of certain cases. 134 16. Patients traveling between states, provinces or countries should be counselled that, by 135 such travel, they may expose themselves to a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. They 136 may also become obliged to remain at their destined center for an unpredictable period of 137 time. After some procedures, patients may return earlier than usual to their referring 138",

These procedures should therefore not be defined as \"elective\" 60 and their provision should be guided by local institutional policies and practices in the context Due to the life-threatening, morbidity-related, and/or time-sensitive nature of conditions 67 requiring intervention, most fetal procedures are not \"elective\". These include, laser surgery or selective reduction.72 c. Shunting procedures for conditions with significant fetal compromise, such as 73 hydropic hydrothoraces or cystic lung lesions. 74 d. Open fetal surgical procedures, that are not experimental or under research 75 protocols, such as, but not limited to, open maternal-fetal surgery for fetal 76 myelomeningocele repair and ex-utero intra-partum therapy (EXIT) for 77 anticipated neonatal airway compromise. 78 2. The above recommendations should apply regardless of a patient's COVID-19 status. 79 The decision to intervene may be influenced by the maternal condition. Maternal health 80 always takes priority over fetal status. 81 3. The limited evidence to date regarding the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 82 through fetal intervention should be included in the informed consent discussion prior to 83 such procedures. 84 4. Fetal therapists always strive to avoid trans-placental passage of our needle or 85 (particularly) fetoscope or shunt trocar, which becomes particularly pertinent when there 86 is a potential risk of maternal-fetal viral transmission. An exception might be fetal transfusion into an anterior placental cord insertion, if the fetal intra-hepatic vein was 88 inaccessible. Open fetal surgical procedures may carry a higher risk of such transmission. 89 5. General anesthesia is a high-risk procedure for viral transmission. The anesthetic risks, 90 and that of horizontal transmission of COVID-19 to HCPs, should be discussed between 91 the patient and her HCPs 5 . Procedures that violate the aero-digestive mucosa and/or 92 result in body fluid aerosolization are associated with COVID-19 transmission 5 . Most 93 fetal procedures can be performed under conscious sedation and local anesthesia, which 94 reduces maternal risk and COVID-19 exposure risk to HCPs. 95 6. Appropriate PPE must be worn for all encounters with COVID-19 positive or PUI 96 (Person Under Investigation) patients. This applies for any potentially aerosolizing 97 procedures, including endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia or Equipment, including ultrasound machines, must be cleansed thoroughly between 100 patients, especially if COVID-19 positive, following stringent cleansing protocols 6 . 101 8. Only essential HCPs should participate in procedures on COVID-19 positive or PUI 102 patients. 103 9. All non-essential personnel should limit direct patient contact. Whenever possible, patient 104 encounters, e.g. sub-specialty consultation or result follow-up, should be conducted 105 virtually 3 . Dedicated fetal therapy nursing and care co-ordination remain critical 106 components of the fetal care team. 107 10. The potential exacerbation of known or unrecognized maternal COVID-19 infection, 108 which could result in increased fetal or maternal morbidity or mortality with any should be entertained. 111 11. Decisions should be made based on local medical, operational and organizational 112 considerations, influenced by local COVID-19 burden.
