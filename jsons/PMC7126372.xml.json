Avian influenza viruses, which are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, cause serious illness and death in domestic poultry. Outbreaks of HPAI have led to human infections, some of which resulted in deaths (Chan, 2002, Yuan et al., 2013). Influenza A viruses can be subdivided into several subtypes based on the antigenic nature of the surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Hinshaw et al., 1982). Human infections with influenza A virus subtypes H5, H7 and H9 cause severe respiratory disease (Chan, 2002, Koopmans et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2000). For example, H5 subtype causes infection and mortality rates of up to 60% (Guzelian et al., 1996, Xiong et al., 2013), whereas the H9 subtype (mainly the H9N2 subtype) has been reported in domestic fowl and wild birds in various regions and is considered to be one of the most likely candidates to cause a new influenza pandemic in humans (Yuan et al., 2013).",

Therefore, the epidemiology of this virus needs to be studied, and potential sources of exposure to the pathogen need to be identified. To date, different types of methods have been used to detect influenza A viruses. These methods are categorized based on the type of detection target: nucleic acid-based detection, virus isolation and identification, antigen detection, antibody detection, etc. (Alberini et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008; Ho et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2010; Payungporn et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2008) The most commonly used detection methods are nucleic acid-based detection, such as reverse-transcription PCR, Real-time PCR, RT-LAMP, antibody detection and antigen detection (Antarasena et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2011; He et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2010; Khurana et al., 2011; Shahsavandi et al., 2011; Yea et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). However, most of these methods require specialized equipment and highly trained operators, and these detection processes are time consuming, thereby making them impractical for point-of-care (POCT) detection (Yager et al. 2008). Thus, a sensitive, portable and rapid technology needs to be developed for influenza A virus (including different subtypes) surveillance and prevention.",

Once the influenza A virus subtype H5 or H9 was added to the sample, the QD-labeled antibodies specifically bound the H5 or H9 subtype viruses and were then captured by the coating antibodies at test line 1 or 2 to form a sandwich complex; QD-labeled antibodies that were not bound to the H5 or H9 subtype virus were captured by the goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies at the control line. In the absence of influenza A virus subtype H5 or H9 in the sample, the QD-labeled antibodies were not captured by the coating antibodies at test line 1 or 2 but were only captured by the goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies at the control line. When only virus and antibodies were added onto the strip, the coating antibodies capture the complex well, but neither the test line nor the control line will show fluorescence signal. The captured QDs produced a bright fluorescent band in response to 365 nm ultraviolet excitation. The fluorescence signals from the captured QDs were scanned by a fluorescence test strip scanner. The fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the amount of QD particles and virus complex on the test line of the strip, whereas the lowest fluorescence signal intensity closely correlates with the detection limit of the QD-LFIAS. The detection time was tested by adding H5 and H9 antigens at 16 hemagglutinating units (HAUs) onto the sample pad of the QD-LFIAS strip, which was scanned once per minute from 3 to 50 min by the fluorescence test strip scanner. Fifty negative samples were detected by QDs-LFIAS; the average signal value was calculated, and double this value was defined as the cutoff value. Specifically, the cutoff value for the H5 and H9 test lines were 205 a.u. and 170 a.u., respectively. Fluorescence intensities above and below these values were classified as positive and negative, respectively, for the respective tests. The limit of detection (LOD) of this system was identified by detecting samples containing various amounts of the H5 and H9 antigens. Briefly, high-concentration solutions of H5 and H9 antigens (128 HAU) were two-fold diluted with 20 mM PBS (64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64 and 1/128 HAU) and individually added onto the QD-LFIAS; 20 mM PBS was added as a negative control. The signals were detected by fluorescence test strip scanner. The LOD was then calculated accordingly. The LOD was defined as the minimal concentration that produced the lowest signal exceeding the cutoff value. The reproducibility of this QDs-LFIAS was tested by detecting 20 replicates of the H5 and H9 antigens at different concentrations (32, 4 and 1/2 HAU). The relative standard deviations were then calculated accordingly. The specificity of the QD-LFIAS was examined using influenza A subtype viruses (H1, H3, H5N1 re-4/6, H7N9, H9N2 re-2, and H9 SD696) and other respiratory tract viruses (IBV H52, IBDV Gt, and NDV La Sota) HI test antigens. Each type of the antigen was diluted to 64 HAU with PBS. Sixty microliters of antigen solution of each type was then added individually added onto the QD-LFIAS, followed by fluorescence test strip scanner detection.",

The dynamic light scattering analysis in Fig. 2B shows that the hydrodynamic size of PMAH-QDs before conjugation is 46.7 nm, and this size increased to 145 nm after conjugation with antibodies, which indicates the successful conjugation of antibodies. We also inspected the fluorescence properties of the QDs, and the results showed that absorption was maximized at 365 nm, whereas emission was maximized at ~620 nm; these peaks were approximately symmetric (Fig. 2C).

Fifteen minutes after the addition of the samples, the signals were scanned using a fluorescence test strip scanner. As demonstrated in\nFig. 4A, the virus concentration directly correlated with the fluorescence intensity on the test lines. The fluorescence from test line of H5 at 0.125 (1/8) HAU remained visible with the naked eye, whereas the lowest concentration of H9 detected with the naked eye was 0.5 (1/2) HAU; however, the handheld device was able to detect low titers of both the H5 and H9 virus subtypes. As show in Fig. 4B, the QD-LFIAS was able to detect influenza A virus subtype H5 at a concentration of 1/64 HAU or higher because the resultant fluorescence intensities were higher than the cutoff value (205), implying that the LOD of this method for H5 was 1/64 HAU. For the detection of influenza A virus subtype H9, the QD-LFIAS was able to detect a minimum concentration of 1/4 HAU because the resultant fluorescence intensity was higher than the cutoff value (170), implying that the LOD of this method for H9 was 1/4 HAU. Most importantly, the signals did not interfere with each other when simultaneously analyzing H5 and H9 on a same strip. Thus, this assay was able to simultaneously detect two subtypes of type A influenza virus on one strip with high sensitivity. In order to measure non-specific adsorption, 20 mM PBS was striped onto the nitrocellulose membrane as the test line 1 and line 2, 1 mg/mL goat anti-mouse IgG was striped as the control line, then assemble them into strips. H5 and H9 antigens at different concentrations were tested with those strips, The results showed very low fluorescence intensity was detected at the test line 1 and line 2 (data not show here). This proved that the fluorescence intensity variation was due to the interaction between the immobilized antibodies and the virus.",

The concentrations of all of these HI test antigens were maintained at a relatively high level (64 HAU).\nFig. 5 shows that at the same virus titer, the fluorescent signal from the H5 and H9 QD-LFIAS tests reached ultrahigh levels (20,000\u201325,000 for H5 subtypes and 28,000\u201332,000 for H9 subtypes), whereas those of the other viruses were below the cutoff value.

Furthermore, this assay is easy to conduct and rapidly produces results, making it a promising candidate for preliminary screening. The assay consists of only one step: adding the sample and the QDs\u2013Ab mixtures onto the QDs-LFIAS strip and checking the result presented by the equipment in 15 min, which eliminates the need for professional laboratory technicians and expensive equipment and permits high-throughput screening. Alternatively, nucleic acid-based detection methods were proved to be highly efficient, specific and accurate detection methods for viruses (Deng et al., 2011; Grabowska et al., 2014; Lai et al., 2012; Payungporn et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2010). However, nucleic acid isolation requires a clean environment and professional technicians and usually requires multiple steps. Virus isolation and identification, the golden standard of virus detection, requires special serum and complex procedures. Traditional POCT methods, such as colloidal gold immune chromatography strips, relies on color depth and is consequently associated with subjective judgment error. Furthermore, the complexity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) may affect the detection accuracy. Conversely, the objectivity of the QD-LFIAS avoids the subjectivity associated with detecting color depth with the human eye and can detect an unobservable signal in just one simple step. Because the fluorescence immunoassay was more sensitive than ELISA, its use is promising in POCT diagnosis (Li et al., 2012).",

The LODs of QD-LFIAS for the detection of influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H9 were 0.016 HAU and 0.25 HAU, respectively. Moreover, these two virus subtypes can be simultaneously detected on only one LFIAS strip without interferences. The specificity and reproducibility were both good, and the accuracy was as high as that of real-time PCR. By changing the conjugation and capturing antibody pairs, this system can be conveniently extended to detect other types of pathogens.
