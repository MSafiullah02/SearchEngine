Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVD), and bovine herpes virus 1, have been found to be the most important viruses associated with respiratory disease in calves and young stock (Autio et al., 2007). In a study of Norwegian dairy calves, Hyllseth et al. (1987) found that the overall seroprevalence was highest for PIV3, whereas antibodies against BRSV were less common. Norway has been declared free from BVD and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, which is caused by bovine herpes virus 1 (Kampen et al., 2007a; 2007b). The major bacterial pathogens involved in respiratory disease, such as Mannheimia hemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, and Histophilus somni, may all be present as commensals in clinically healthy cattle, but secondary infections with one or more of these worsen the clinical outcome. Bovine mycoplasmas have been reported to be of increasing importance as a primary cause of calf pneumonia (Kusiluka et al., 2000), and are often isolated from pneumonic lungs in combination with other pathogens (Booker et al., 2008).",

The frailty effect equals the strength of association between 2 individuals within the same herd, as measured by Kendall's \u03c4 (1 - \u03b8), and was considered significant at P\n < 0.05. The end of the observation period in a calf was defined as 180 d of age if there was no event of respiratory disease. Data were censored when the animal left the herd because of sale or slaughter. Only the first case of respiratory disease from birth until 180 d of age was considered an event. The significance of the different variables was initially evaluated by univariate analysis. If the P-value was less than 0.1, the variable was included in a final multivariable model. Nonsignificant variables were removed one by one by backward stepwise elimination, with the inclusion criterion of P\n < 0.05. Possible interactions between significant fixed effects were tested.",

The present study shows that important respiratory pathogens are common in the Norwegian dairy cattle population, as in other cattle-producing countries (H\u00e4rtel et al., 2004; H\u00e4gglund et al., 2006). Bovine respiratory syncytial virus, PIV3, and BCoV seem to be ubiquitous, because more than 70% of the herds were positive (Table 2). Antibodies against M. bovis were not found, and respiratory disease caused by this agent has apparently not been reported in Norway. A recent Finnish study also reported similar results for M. bovis (Autio et al., 2007). These results are in contrast to the situation reported in other countries, where M. bovis is considered an important cause of respiratory infections in cattle (Radaelli et al., 2008). The present results and the fact that Norway is recognized as free from important infectious diseases such as BVD and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (Kampen et al., 2007a,b) indicate that a restrictive import policy is probably beneficial because it limits the introduction of new infectious agents. Routine screening at high-risk settings, such as bull-testing facilities, may be an option for detecting the introduction of infectious respiratory diseases, and molecular characterization of isolated viruses from such a setting may be a useful tool for monitoring those strains that are actively circulating in the cattle population.",

The number of animals susceptible to infections in large herds is higher than in small herds, which could contribute to maintaining infections circling within a herd over extended periods. The degree of human traffic and spreading of infectious agents between herds would also be greater in larger herds; therefore, the importance of establishing biosafety routines should be considered higher in larger herds than in smaller ones. Calves in larger herds tend to be more densely housed, resulting in closer animal-to-animal contact, which could promote the spread of infections. Svensson and Liberg (2006) found that calves housed in group pens of more than 12 calves had an increased risk of respiratory disease. Nonsupervised calvings have also been associated with an increased risk of respiratory disease (Svensson et al., 2003), and as herd size increases, the daily inspection of individual animals might be reduced.",

Both factors were found to have a significant effect on the occurrence of respiratory infection when cluster effects at the herd level were not included. Although the presence of the dam and suckling might increase the amount of IgG absorbed (Quigley et al., 1995), calves left to suckle their dams have often been found to have insufficient IgG intake (Trotz-Williams et al., 2008) and the risk of disease in these calves is higher (Svensson et al., 2003). Additional colostrum, fed manually by bottle, seems beneficial if the calf and dam are left together.",

Depending on animal density, the load of infectious agents in a stall housing both calves and cows is likely to be considerably higher than in a stall housing only calves, thereby increasing the risk of infections. However, young cattle should be regarded as the primary reservoir and as important contributors for most infectious calf pathogens (E. Jor, National Veterinary Institute, Oslo, personal communication). Svensson et al. (2003) found an increased risk of respiratory disease in calves of 1 to 12 wk of age housed in group pens of 6 to 30 animals compared with calves housed in smaller groups. Minimizing the age difference between calves housed in the same group pen is favorable because older calves are often the source of infection for younger calves (Maddox-Hyttel et al., 2006).",
