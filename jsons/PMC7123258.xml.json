Human coronavirus 229E, pseudorabies virus, and rotavirus are most stable at intermediate RH. The first two are enveloped, while mature rotaviruses are usually nonenveloped.

A similar occurrence has also been reported for a hotel restaurant (Marks et al., 2003). A retrospective cohort study conducted after a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 suggested that airborne spread may have played an important role in the transmission of the disease. The same mode of transmission was also hypothesized in other studies of SARS (Li et al., 2005, Yu et al., 2005). Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a virus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most MERS patients developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. About 3 to 4 out of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died. The disease was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. Later retrospective studies identified that the first known cases of MERS occurred in Jordan in April 2012. So far, all cases of MERS have been linked through travel to, or residence in, countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. The outbreak was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, is thought to spread from an infected person\u2019s respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, the precise ways the virus spreads are not currently well understood (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/, (2017)).",

All of them enable qualified quantitative analysis of viable micro(myco)flora present. The dilution method may be employed to characterize the fungi associated with settled dust. And swabs or adhesive tapes are used to sample microbes from the surfaces. These samples first undergo the direct microscopic observation, followed by cultivation evaluation. The modern state-of-art in sampling methods has been broaden by modifications of PCR (microarrays), showing the presence of e. g. stachybotrys directly in the affected material, incl. the air. There are also laboratory setups with propagules\u2019 optical size counters coupled to computing of the aerodynamic size of the germs and their depository potential (Sivasubramani et al., 2004).",

To use this sampler, open agar plates are placed between each metal section, resting on three studs. When fully assembled with an open agar plate between each unit an electric motor sucks air from the bottom of the unit, causing spore-laden air to enter at the top and to pass down through the cylinder. The path taken by this air is shown in Fig. 11.3 (http://archive.bio.ed.ac.uk).\n",

During normal breathing, the airflow in the nose and trachea is about 100 cm per second \u2013 sufficient for pollen grains and larger fungal spores, esp. macrospores (Alternaria sp. etc.) to be retained on the mucous, where they can cause typical hay fever symptoms like (allergic) rhinitis and asthma.

So all the particles of 5 \u03bcm or less are carried deep into the lungs. There they can settle out by sedimentation in the brief periods when the air is calm between successive breaths. Particles of 2\u20134 \u03bcm are optimal for alveolar deposition, and this range includes the spores of many Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. This is how some of the serious fungal infections of humans are initiated \u2013 aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis etc.Even smaller particles, such as the spores of actinomycetes along with hyphal fragments (about 1 \u03bcm) are less efficient at being deposited in the alveoli, but repeated exposure to aerosol clouds can lead to sensitisation and extrinsic allergic alveolitis (farmer\u2019s lungs etc.).\nVery small particles, less than about 0.5 \u03bcm, do not impact but are moved by diffusion (Brownian motion) which brings them randomly into contact with surfaces in the lungs, and are able to cross other barriers in human body, e.g. meninges.
