            "text": "Respiratory pathology is one of the commonest consequences of preterm birth1 manifesting early as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a product of structurally immature lungs and pulmonary surfactant deficiency. These preterm infants often require invasive and non-invasive respiratory support, supplementary oxygen and surfactant replacement therapy. A proportion of these infants will go on to develop chronic lung disease of prematurity2, with abnormal respiratory function and increased respiratory morbidity persisting through childhood3\u20135 and into adult life6. Approximately 11% of all infants are born preterm, with this figure rising in many countries internationally7. Therefore, as this cohort of patients grows in number, and overall survival improves, optimal early management of these infants is likely to confer lifelong health benefits.",

However, there are two areas which appear to have deteriorated: stabilising infants in the delivery room with an FiO2 21\u201330% and use of CPAP pressures of \u2265 6cmH2O. Both of these practices showed some variation depending on the unit level and GA, with the tertiary units being more likely to use higher CPAP pressures, but less mature infants being more likely to be stabilised with a higher inspired oxygen fraction. Owing to the data collection methodology, this could be secondary to documentation; however, it is important to emphasise the importance of not exposing premature infants to unnecessarily high FiO2 during stabilisation.",

This may be due to the experience of those in attendance and general confidence within unit culture in managing more vulnerable infants with non-invasive ventilation. Extremely preterm infants born in level two units may need intubation before transfer to a tertiary unit for further care. However, no variation in intubation was observed based on unit of delivery, although only a small proportion of these infants were delivered in level two units. Further evidence on LISA in extreme preterm infants16 may improve the success of non-invasive respiratory support in this population. In addition, several local quality improvement projects are ongoing in many of the neonatal units in Wales, and we hope to see improved practice in the next round of data collection.",

Retrospective audits have found variable use of prophylactic surfactant with less use in more mature infants18, and good adherence on early management in a cohort of twenty infants <28 weeks\u2019 gestation19.

The effect of incomplete participation of level-two units was partly mitigated as the majority of preterm infants were delivered in tertiary units. However, some Welsh preterm infants born in non-participating units did not have their management audited, and there may be more variation in practice than appreciated. It was difficult to determine the number of eligible infants (denominator) for some interventions through the data collection process, although the majority of these were based on grade B and C evidence. We also did not collect data on other relevant clinical indicators like admission temperature, which may have an effect on the severity of RDS; this will be added in future rounds of data collection. Finally, since our study examined practice against an established guideline, data on the outcome of these infants were not collected; this remains an objective in future rounds of data-collection.",

Additionally, it also recommended delayed cord clamping of at least sixty-seconds is practised where possible. Our data demonstrates that intubation rates at delivery have remained unchanged despite introduction of the Wales guideline, and the number of infants receiving delayed cord clamping remains low. There are quality improvement and training initiatives targeting these practices currently underway in Welsh neonatal units, and this will form a major focus in the next cycle of data collection in this quality improvement project.",

Interestingly, our data suggests relatively limited variation between level two and three units. Some important areas of practice have shown substantial improvement, but there remain areas of practice that are not in keeping with current best evidence, most importantly the low rates of extremely preterm infants being stabilised on non-invasive respiratory support. Unified, national guidelines are a potentially powerful tool to effect change and reduce variation in practice. They are feasible to implement and can be established in other neonatal networks and nations of the UK. Moving forward, an update to the European Consensus Guideline has recently been published13 and, following review, the Wales Neonatal Network guideline will be updated to reflect any substantial changes, followed by dissemination of the evidence and education of staff. Re- evaluations of RDS management in Wales are planned to continue on a three-yearly cycle, with the next being undertaken in 2021. We aim to monitor progress and highlight areas requiring further education, cross-departmental working and training to optimise our RDS management.",
