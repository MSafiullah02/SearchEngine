In the context of a pandemic, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, should be promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission 32 . Telemedicine has been shown to improve access to specialized care for patients with epilepsy in difficult circumstances (e.g., living in rural areas) in previous studies 33 . However, many countries do not have a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including during outbreaks 32 . For countries without integrated telemedicine in their national healthcare system, the COVID-19 pandemic is a call to adopt the required regulatory frameworks for supporting wide adoption of telemedicine 32 .",

One should be prepared to treat seizures appropriately, if they happen in a patient who is already in a critical medical condition. Detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients (particularly those with a change in mental status), and attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from CSF may clarify the roles played by this virus in causing seizures.",
