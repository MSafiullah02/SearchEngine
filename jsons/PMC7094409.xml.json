After washing away the detached DNA strand, hybridization with 2 lanthanide probes (Europium for rhinoviruses, Samarium for enteroviruses, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland), was allowed to take place at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes in Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 40 mmol/L supplemented with 10 mmol/L ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid in NaCl 1.5 mol/L. Quantification of lanthanide fluorescence was done in a time-resolved manner. Previous work with prototype strains of human rhinoviruses and human enteroviruses11 revealed that although use of these 2 probes provides optimal capture of the vast number of serotypes in both genera of viruses, it is not always possible to permit unequivocal separation of the 2 groups. Therefore, in the following text, positive hybridization result with both probes is referred to as the presence of rhinovirus.",
