            "text": "We report here a 5596 nt sequence comprising the 3 -end of the (+) ssRNA genome of gill-associated virus (GAV), an invertebrate nidovirus of Penaeus monodon prawns. The sequence extends from a subgenomic RNA start site 35 nt upstream of the 4923 nt ORF3 gene to a 3 -poly(A) tail of the 26235 nt genome of GAV. The putative 1640 amino acid (aa) ORF3 protein (MW = 182049 Da, pI = 6.62) contains 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, 15 potential O-linked glycosylation sites and six highly hydrophobic regions predicted to represent transmembrane (TM) domains. Three of the predicted TM domains occur in the amino-terminal 228 aa, two in the central portion, and one near the carboxy-terminus of ORF3. Only one short (83 aa) open reading frame (ORF4) was identified between ORF3 and the 3 -poly(A) tail. Completion of the genome sequence of GAV has revealed a gene organisation unique among nidoviruses in there is no discrete membrane protein gene and that the putative ORF3 spike glycoprotein gene resides downstream of a gene (ORF2) encoding a structural protein associated with nucleocapsids. * Gill-associated virus (GAV) of Penaeus monodon prawns has been proposed as a type member of a new genus, Okavirus, within the Nidovirales [9] . Chronic GAV infection is highly prevalent in wild and farmed P. monodon in eastern Australia [8, 39, 43] and the virus has been associated with mortalities in farmed * The sequence described in this paper has been deposited in GenBank (Acc: AY039647).",

            "text": "prawns [40] . GAV is morphologically identical to yellow head virus (YHV), which has caused significant losses of P. monodon farmed throughout Asia [25] . GAV and YHV nucleocapsids appear as helical tubular structures (\u223c16 nm dia.) and their rod-shaped, enveloped virions (\u223c34 nm \u00d7 192 nm) possess diffuse surface projections of \u223c8 nm [4, 6, 39, 40, 44] . YHV contains a >22 kb ssRNA genome [27, 45] with suggested positive polarity [41] . The GAV genome 5 -end contains a \u223c20 kb replicase gene encoding overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b polyproteins [9] . Translation of the ORF1a-1b polyprotein is facilitated by a AAAUUUU-1 ribosomal frameshift site and a predicted non-'H-type' RNA pseudoknot. Sequence similarity in the 3C-like protease domain of ORF1a and the 'SDD' polymerase, helicase and other domains of ORF1b indicate a distant evolutionary relationship to vertebrate viruses of the Nidovirales [9] . Conserved sequences in the GAV intergenic regions function as transcription start sites for two 3coterminal subgenomic (sg)RNAs that, in contrast to the sgRNAs of coronaviruses and arteriviruses, are not fused to 5 -genomic leader sequences [10] . Moreover, the ORF2 gene immediately downstream of ORF1a-1b encodes the 144 amino acid protein similar in size and charge to torovirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins [14, 34] and which immuno-electron microscopy indicates is associated with GAV nucleocapsids [JA Cowley et al. unpubl.] , suggesting it is likely to represent the nucleocapsid protein.",

Briefly, cDNA was reverse transcribed from the purified \u223c22 kb dsRNA using the anchored primer Uni-dT 16 -C/A/G ( 5 GCCGGAGCTCT GCAGAATTC(T) 16 -C/A/G 3 ). Second strand cDNA was synthesised using Klenow DNA polymerase and primer Uni-dN 6 ( 5 GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGAATT C(N) 6 3 ). Primer was removed following each reaction using a Sephadex 400 HR column (Pharmacia) and cDNA was amplified by PCR using Uni-primer ( 5 GCCG GAGCTCTGCAGAATTC 3 ) and Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) [9] . PCR products of variable size were purified using a QIAquick column (QIAGEN) and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) using standard procedures [31] . (b) A cDNA clone was generated similarly using lymphoid organ total RNA from P. monodon experimentally-infected with GAV and cDNA synthesised using primer Uni-dT 16 -C/A/G followed by PCR amplification using Uni-primer and the GAV sense primer GAV69 ( 5 TCATATTACATCGCTGGTGATCCAGG 3 ) designed to a sequence in clone p18/20. A predominant 2.7 kb product was excised from an agarose gel, purified using a QIAquick column and cloned into pGEM-T. (c) cDNA clones of the GAV genome 3 -end were also obtained from a Uni-ZAP \u00ae XR (Stratagene) \u03bb bacteriophage library kindly provided by Dr. Sigrid Lehnert, CSIRO Livestock Industries. Briefly, oligo-dT 18 -primed cDNA was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA purified from a whole head homogenate of a P. monodon naturally-infected with GAV, ligated into the Uni-ZAP XR vector and packaged according to the ZAP-cDNA \u00ae Gigapack \u00ae III Gold cloning kit (Stratagene) instructions. The \u03bb phage library in SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO 4 , 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.01% gelatin) was diluted 1:10 in water, heated at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min and microcentrifuged for 5 min. An aliquot (1 \u00b5l) was amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase (Promega), an extended T7 primer ( 5 GTAATACGACTCACTATGGGC 3 ) and the GAV sense primer GAV86 ( 5 GCTCCACACAGGCACTACCG 3 ) using 40 cycles of 95 \u2022 C/45 sec, 60 \u2022 C/45 sec, 72 \u2022 C/1 min. PCR products derived from GAV-specific poly(A)+ RNA were cloned into pGEM-T. Plasmid inserts were sequenced using FS-Big Dye reagent (ABI), T7, SP6 or GAV-specific primers and ABI Model-377 sequencing apparatus at the Australian Genome Research Facility, Brisbane. Sequences were edited using SeqEd 3.0.1 (ABI) and analysed using MacVector 7 (Oxford Molecular).",

The complete GAV genome sequence is deposited in GenBank Acc no: AF227196 and AY039647 and the ORF2 gene sequence will be described elsewhere. The 3 -terminal sequence contains a 4923 nt ORF3 gene encoding a putative 1640 amino acid (aa) protein with a deduced molecular weight of 182049 Da and pI of 6.62. No polypeptides with significant similarity to the putative ORF3 protein were identified in BLAST 2.0 [1] searches of GenBank. ORF3 contains 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and the NetOGly 2.0 program [18] predicted 15 potential O-linked glycosylation sites predominantly located in the N-terminal half of ORF3. Six highly hydrophobic regions (G 27 -F 50 , S 138 -T 156 , F 210 -A 228 , A 996 -L 1018 , F 1081 -A 1103 and Y 1605 -I 1627 ), probably representing transmembrane (TM) domains, were predicted using TMpred [20] (Figs. 2 and 3) . Prediction of membrane topology using TMHMM [38] identified three likely ORF3 ectodomains (Fig. 3) . The putative ectodomains, ORF3a (4 Cys), ORF3b (24 Cys) and ORF3c (22 Cys) following TM domains 1, 3 and 5 contained even numbers of Cys residues reflecting the likelihood that they are involved in intra-domain disulphidebond formation. No heptad-repeat patterns indicative of the coiled-coil structures common to the structural glycoproteins of coronaviruses [11] and toroviruses [35] were predicted in ORF3 using the COILS program [26] . The absence of The novel structure predicted for the putative GAV ORF3 glycoprotein suggests that it may be processed and function differently to the S glycoproteins of coronaviruses and toroviruses. At 1640 aa, ORF3 is the largest glycoprotein yet identified for any virus in the Nidovirales. The S glycoprotein gene of coronaviruses encodes polypeptides that range in size from 1160 aa for Infectious bronchitis virus [3] to 1452 aa for Feline infectious peritoneal virus [11] , while the cognate genes of the toroviruses Berne virus and Breda virus [14, 35] encode polypeptides (1581-1583 aa) approaching the size of GAV ORF3. Moreover, while the S glycoproteins of these viruses contain hydrophobic regions representing a signal peptide and a single TM anchor, six hydrophobic TM domains are predicted in GAV ORF3 (Fig. 3) . Although a cluster of basic amino acids (KHLKVHARHHK 1069 ) occurs in the central ORF3 region between TM domains \u1b64 Fig. 2 . Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frames (ORF3 and ORF4) in the 5596 nt region of GAV from the 5 -sgRNA start site in the intergenic region upstream of ORF3 to the 3 -poly(A) tail. The six hydrophobic ORF3 regions predicted to represent transmembrane domains are underlined, the 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites are boxed and the cluster of basic amino acids between hydrophobic regions 4 and 5 are shaded. Potential cleavage sites predicted using SignalP [28] are indicated ( ) Fig. 3 . a Hydropathy plot of the 1640 amino acid GAV ORF3 generated using the method of Kyte and Doolittle [22] using a window size of 19. b Schematic diagram of the membrane orientation predicted using TMHMM [38] showing the relative positions of the six predicted transmembrane domains, the 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (\u2022) and the two cleavage sites (arrows) predicted using SignalP [28] with potential to generate ORF3a, ORF3b and ORF3c proteins 4 and 5, it is unlike the Arg-rich 'RR(F/S/H)RR'-type proteolytic cleavage motifs involved in generating the S1 and S2 glycoprotein components of the virion spikes of coronaviruses and toroviruses [5, 35] . Furthermore, the predicted internal membrane orientation would preclude enzymatic cleavage in this region of GAV ORF3. The GAV genome contains conspicuously few genes (ORF2, ORF3 and possibly ORF4) other than the ORF1a-1b replicase gene and immuno-electron microscopy using antibodies to the \u223c20 kDa ORF2 protein indicates that it forms a component of nucleocapsids [JA Cowley et al. unpubl.] , suggesting it is likely to be the structural nucleocapsid protein. Purified virions of YHV, which is genetically closely related to GAV [7] , contain only three major structural proteins (M r 110-135, 62-67 and 20-22 kDa), the largest of which is glycosylated [27, 44] . As the GAV ORF2 protein is comparable in size to the 20-22 kDa YHV protein, it can be deduced that ORF3 must encode the virus spike glycoprotein and that post-translational processing would be required to generate polypeptides of a size estimated for the two larger YHV proteins. The GAV ORF3 sequence gives few clues to mechanisms by which such proteins might be generated. Possible cleavage at sites (TFA 228 -KE and ASA 1101 -LA) predicted after the third and fifth TM domains using SignalP [28] would generate three TM-anchored proteins, ORF3a (228 aa = 25.2 kDa), ORF3b (873 aa = 98.1 kDa) and ORF3c (539 aa = 58.7 kDa). The theoretical GAV ORF3b and ORF3c proteins approach the size and, assuming that glycosylation could account for some additional mass, are plausibly equivalent to the two largest (i.e. 110-135 and 62-67 kDa) YHV structural proteins [27, 44] . However, this would require the use of these predicted TM domains as internal signal sequences as has been proposed for processing of the multiple membrane-spanning structural glycoproteins of alphaviruses [16, 19, 29] and phleboviruses [21, 30] . Identification of the terminal sequences of the processed GAV spike glycoproteins and experimental investigation of the six hydrophobic domains in ORF3 is required to determine their role in processing, transport and membrane anchoring of the GAV structural glycoproteins.",

Identification of the 3 -terminus using cDNA primed from the \u223c22 kb dsRNA purified from GAV-infected prawn tissue confirmed that this dsRNA represents a genomic replicative intermediate and that the 3 -end of the (+) sense strand is polyadenylated. Equivalent sequences identified in clones generated using cDNA primed similarly from either total or poly(A)-selected RNA also supported previous data that the (+) sense genomic and sgRNAs are 3 -polyadenylated. It should be noted, however, that 5 clones derived from a phage library produced using poly(A)+ RNA from the whole head of a GAV-infected P. monodon all possessed one to two point mutations (i.e. in lower case 5 ..TGATA(T/g)GA(A/c)(A/g)A n -3 ) within \u22121 to +3 nt of the poly(A) junction shown in Fig. 2 . However, these clones were generated using a non-anchored oligo-dT primer and significance of the point mutations is not yet clear. Each of the five clones also possessed upstream point mutations (5 to 8/306 nt) and two possessed single point deletions (C 5537 and A 5545 ) \u223c50 nt from the poly(A) junction. While RNA from P. monodon experimentally-infected with the prototype GAV isolate [40] was used to derive the sequence shown in Fig. 2 , the more variable sequences occurred in clones derived from a prawn naturally infected with GAV. Thus, it is likely that the point mutations/deletions are attributable to RNA quasispecies and/or virus strain differences. The genomic (+) RNA 3 -untranslated regions of coronaviruses and arteriviruses contain promoter sequences for transcription of negative-sense genomic and sgRNAs [13, 17, 23, 24, 37] . Cell lines in which GAV will replicate and/or reverse genetics systems will be required to gain an understanding of the 3 -terminal sequences that are important to the genomic replication process in this crustacean nidovirus.",

            "text": "The data reported here demonstrates that the (+) ssRNA genome of GAV is 3polyadenylated similarly to genomes of all viruses of the Nidovirales. However, due to the apparent absence of discrete membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein genes downstream of the GAV ORF3 glycoprotein gene, independent approaches were employed to be confident that we had identified the true genomic 3 -end. Completion of the genome sequence of GAV has revealed a gene organisation that is unique among the nidoviruses currently described. Significantly, GAV contains no discrete gene encoding an integral M protein and the gene (ORF2) most likely to encode the viral N protein resides upstream of a gene (ORF3) predicted to encode a large complex glycoprotein(s). Only two subgenomic (sg)RNAs are transcribed in abundance in GAV-infected cells [10] compared to five to nine sgRNAs in vertebrate nidoviruses. Moreover, similarly to toroviruses [36] , there is no evidence of the complex leader-primed discontinuous transcription mechanism employed by coronaviruses [32] and arteriviruses [42] . These characteristics, taken together with the fact that the 26235 nt GAV genome comprises relatively few genes, suggests that this crustacean nidovirus is evolutionary more primitive than its vertebrate counterparts. In this regard, it may be relevant to note that the natural penaeid host of GAV has changed little from ancestral crustaceans that date back at least to the Cambrian period >500 million years ago [33] .",
