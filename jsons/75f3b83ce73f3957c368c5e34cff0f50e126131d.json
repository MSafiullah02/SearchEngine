While a blanket policy to restrict non-essential surgery is appropriate for acute outbreak conditions, this may need to be modified if the pandemic continues for a prolonged duration, as a long wait for elective surgery could begin to result in harm for some patients. Therefore, it is essential to begin to gain a more nuanced understanding of the basic epidemiology of elective surgery in the US, as well as the burden of these surgeries on acute healthcare utilization in the US. These data are vital to make evidence-based decisions to match supply and demand during prolonged pandemic conditions.",

            "text": "While we agree that all available medical and logistical information at an organizational level should be used, we also believe that downstream healthcare utilization from certain operations predictably impair COVID-19 surge capacity. Examining 2018 data from the Premier healthcare database during the relevant time period of the current COVID-19 pandemic (April-June), it is apparent that joint replacement, bariatric surgery, and spine surgery represent some of the most common inpatient elective procedures (Figure 1 ). To gain a more nuanced understanding of the burden of elective surgeries on downstream acute care utilization, we provide an example using the joint replacement surgery population. First, examining 379,829 patients hospitalized for surgery across 667 facilities within the Premier Perspective database 6 from April-June of 2018, we found that 61,889 (16%) were admitted for joint replacements, making this a very common operation. Second, considerable downstream hospital bed-days become available with a temporary moratorium on joint replacements. For example, the average length of stay following a joint replacement was almost 2 days; thus, suspending joint replacements for the 3-month period of Apr-June 2018 would translate to 123,778 hospital bed-days available for hospital surge capacity in the Premier alliance alone. Lastly, with over 75% of patients over 60 yr of age, admission to hospitals for joint replacement surgery puts such patients at risk for hospitalacquired COVID-19. Using this simple example, we can extend this logic to examine other common elective surgeries, as well as other markers of acute care utilization (intensive care unit admission, ventilator days, blood transfusion, and vasopressor utilization) to identify elective surgical procedures that may be need to be delayed to fulfill health system needs at a given time (such as ICU beds). When these data are combined with robust local outbreak modeling data, data-driven decisions on elective surgery delays can be made to match supply and demand in the setting of a prolonged pandemic.",

Given the availability of ventilators, monitoring equipment, and critical care drugs, ORs can serve as a physical location for the provision of critical care. According to 2020 data from the American Hospital Association, there are currently only 69,785 adult intensive care beds (comprised of medical, surgical, cardiac, burn, and other) in US non-federal hospitals 7 .

First, appropriate staffing models need to be employed for care of critically ill patients within ORs; given delays in elective surgery, the workforce of perioperative clinicians will likely be available. Thankfully, the daily tasks of anaesthesiologists and nurse anaesthetists include ventilator management, sedation, and haemodynamic management, all of which are essential for the management of critically ill patients. Given the debate surrounding shortages in intensivists 8 and concerns about a further loss of providers through illness, anaesthesia professionals can be used to build surge capacity. Second, appropriate organizational principles to manage this \"critical care extension\" and educational outreach will need to occur as soon as possible. To accomplish this goal, existing models, including a model endorsed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), could be implemented rapidly 9 . In the SCCM model, a board certified intensivist will always be available for consultation (either in person or virtually) to on-the-ground healthcare providers.",

Critical illness as a result of COVID-19 has the potential to directly affect available critical care space for other common critical illnesses (such as severe sepsis, pneumonia, decompensated heart failure, surgical critical illness, and trauma). The latter conditions are likely to either stay the same in terms of incidence, or increase given disruptions in the supply of caregivers, medications, and equipment. Care for these patients within the perioperative infrastructure may be needed if traditional critical care units (given their availability of negative pressure rooms and specialized staff) are needed to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

Important considerations include: 1) What types of critically ill patients will be cared for in perioperative spaces? 2) How will education be provided to prepare perioperative providers to care for critically ill patients? and 3) What organizational infrastructure (including intensivist consultation and regionalization of care) will work best in the local environment?
