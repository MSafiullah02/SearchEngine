VCPs are found in many enveloped and naked human viruses as well as in plant viruses.20, 21, 22 Generally they are about 100 amino acids in length, with the exception of 3a from SARS\u2010CoV, which is found to be made of 274 amino acids. In many cases, the role of the VCPs in the infectivity cycle of the virus is not univocally established. Up to now, structural investigations of individual VCPs reveal, that they adopt a helical motif to span the bilayer, which is also supported by secondary structure prediction programs. On the basis of the latter, 8a has been simulated using a helical motif for its transmembrane domain (TMD).16 Furthermore, it has been suggested, that a pentameric assembly forms the most plausible bundle model. Bilayer recording studies reveal weak cation selectivity of the protein.",
