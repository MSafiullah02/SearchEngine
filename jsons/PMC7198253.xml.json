Due to the fact that this model is focused on the problematic area of prepress processes (printing), some of its fragments will be described in terms of the MARCP model. SIE-model is presented in the form of several different levels, corresponding to the imitation, expert and situational presentation of information [13]. The first level of the model is intended to describe the structure of the system. For this, a block is associated with each object (subject). Blocks are interconnected by interaction channels. Each block processes a transaction for a certain time and delays it for a time determined by the intensity. We formulate the following conclusions:The SIE-model can serve as the basis for creating a multi-agent BP model.The SIE-model has the following advantages: apparatus/ mechanism for diagnosing situations; a combination of simulation, expert and situational approaches.The SIE model does not satisfy the requirements of the BP model: the presence of a DM (agent) model; problem orientation to business processes.\n",
