            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The mortality rate has increased significantly over the past 10 years not only in Taiwan but also in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region [1], [2], [3]. The key causative pathogens of CAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and atypical pathogens [1], [2], [3]. According to the antimicrobial treatment guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of Taiwan [1], [2], [3], the drugs of choice for CAP in outpatients are penicillin-related agents if urine cultures are positive for pneumococcal antigen, and macrolide- or tetracycline-related agents if urine cultures are negative for pathogens. However, the rate of penicillin, macrolide and tetracycline resistance amongst S. pneumoniae isolates is high in Taiwan [4]. The antibiotic options for inpatients with CAP are \u03b2-lactams or respiratory fluoroquinolones (RFQs) (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin). In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic combined with a macrolide or with a fluoroquinolone (FQ) is appropriate [1], [2], [3]. However, the increasing resistance of key pathogens to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics poses great challenges to physicians in Taiwan. RFQs can be used in the treatment of CAP in outpatients [5], inpatients and patients in the ICU. RFQs have been shown to have excellent activity against key causative pathogens of CAP as well as atypical pathogens; however, use of RFQs for empirical treatment of CAP might mask the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), leading to delayed treatment and FQ resistance amongst subsequently isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.",

            "text": "In Taiwan, patients with CAP who were previously healthy and have not used antibiotics in the 3 months prior to disease onset are normally given a macrolide or doxycycline as outpatient treatment [3]. However, the rates of non-susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin amongst clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae have increased markedly in recent years [4]. Therefore, caution should be exercised before administering macrolides for CAP unless atypical pathogens are highly suspected. For patients with co-morbidities, a RFQ or a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic plus macrolide is suggested [3]. For inpatients with co-morbidities, especially in the ICU, a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic plus either azithromycin or a FQ is suggested [1], [2], [3]. For atypical pathogens, FQs are as effective as macrolides. The length of stay in hospital and the time to clinical stability favour the use of FQs [15]. Drago et al. showed that the combination of levofloxacin with ceftriaxone produced the highest rate of synergy (54%), mainly against macrolide-resistant isolates, whereas clarithromycin combined with AMC was shown to be antagonistic in 22% of isolates [16]. No antagonism was noted between FQ and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [16]. The prevalence of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae increased markedly during the period 2001\u20132007 in Hong Kong, especially amongst the elderly [17]. The most common aetiology of levofloxacin resistance was suboptimal use of a FQ in which small doses (100\u2013200 mg) of ofloxacin and levofloxacin were administered two or three times daily. Accordingly, appropriate doses of a RFQ (levofloxacin, 750 mg/day; moxifloxacin, 400 mg/day; and gemifloxacin, 320 mg/day) are recommended [1], [2], [3].",

            "text": "Dooley et al. was the first to point out the possibility that empirical treatment with a FQ might delay the diagnosis of TB [27]. Amongst patients who received empirical FQ treatment, the median time between symptom onset and receipt of anti-TB medication was 21 days compared with a median time of 5 days amongst those who did not receive FQs [27], [28]. However, the sample size in their study was small. Of the 17 patients who did not receive FQs, 7 received anti-TB therapy and 3 patients did not receive antibiotic treatment. The initial acid-fast bacillus smear was positive in 8 of those patients. TB was suspected in at least one-half of the patients who did not receive FQs, so antibiotics were not prescribed and anti-TB treatment was given directly. Interestingly, of those patients who received FQ monotherapy, 83% experienced improvement in the symptoms of TB, and clinical improvement occurred an average of 3 days after the initiation of therapy. Other studies have also reported that the delay in initiation of anti-TB medication was longer amongst patients who received FQs than amongst patients who did not receive FQ-based antibiotics (43.1 \u00b1 40.0 days vs. 18.7 \u00b1 16.9 days; P\n = 0.04) [28], [29], [30]. Median healthcare delay for patients who received antibiotics for non-TB diagnoses/indications prior to TB diagnosis was 39 days versus 15 days (P\n < 0.01) for patients who had initially received TB therapy [26]. Not only did administration of a FQ result in a delayed diagnosis of TB (median 29 days), but administration of other antibiotics (such as \u03b2-lactams, macrolides or carbapenems) had a similar effect (median 31 days). In the study by Golub et al., only 57% of patients initially diagnosed as having pneumonia had a chest radiograph [31]. Interestingly, 34% of the chest radiographs suggested a diagnosis of TB; however, the patients were still subsequently prescribed empirical antibiotics. More importantly, both antibiotic use and not having a chest radiograph taken during the first healthcare visit were independently related to longer healthcare delays in the overall cohort. Mathur et al. showed that ca. 44\u201355% of active TB patients were given an incorrect diagnosis at the initial presentation, mainly because of atypical radiographic manifestations [32]. A study from Malaysia clearly demonstrated that a duration of symptoms of >2 weeks before hospital admission [odds ratio (OR) = 25.1; P\n < 0.001), history of night sweats (P\n = 0.038), a chest radiograph showing upper lobe involvement (P\n = 0.012) or cavitary infiltrates (P\n = 0.002), a total white blood cell count of \u226412 \u00d7 109/L on admission (P\n = 0.029) and lymphopenia (P\n = 0.040)] was significantly associated with culture-positive pulmonary TB (Fig. 5\n) [19]. In addition, lower lung field TB (LLFTB) is difficult to differentiate from pneumonia and is often misdiagnosed because of atypical findings on chest radiographs [33], [34]. In Taiwan, ca. 20% of pulmonary TB patients have LLFTB [33]. Multivariate analysis conducted by Lin et al. showed that prolonged duration of symptoms \u22657 days (OR = 4.57; P\n = 0.038), lack of fever >38 \u00b0C (OR = 9.04; P\n = 0.001) and the absence of air bronchograms (OR = 12.08; P\n = 0.007) were significant predictors of LLFTB in patients with LLF pneumonia [35]. A calculated probability of >0.36 suggests LLFTB with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 86.1% [35].",

Lai et al. found that approximately two-thirds of ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates were MDR and, surprisingly, the rates of FQ resistance were highest amongst adults aged 34\u201344 years [25]. Only 22.2% of FQ-resistant TB isolates (8/36) were susceptible to all first-line anti-TB agents. Their results were similar to those reported by van den Boogaard et al., who showed that the rate of FQ-resistant TB was low in TB patients and was not related to previous brief FQ exposure [36]. Park et al. evaluated the impact of short-term exposure to FQ on ofloxacin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients with TB and found that the rate of ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis was low and that most cases of ofloxacin resistance were associated with MDR-TB [37]. They also found that the frequency of ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis was low amongst patients who were exposed to FQs for a short period of time [37]. These findings favour the application of FQs in the regimen for CAP or TB in patients with shorter disease durations.",
