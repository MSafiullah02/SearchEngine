I combine survey and behavioral data to examine partisans' vaccination rates during the Bush and Obama administrations. I find that presidential co-partisans are more likely to believe that vaccines are safe and more likely to vaccinate themselves and their children than presidential out-partisans. Depending on the vaccine, presidential co-partisans are 4-10 percentage points more likely to vaccinate than presidential out-partisans. Using causal mediation analysis, I find that this effect is the result of partisans' differing levels of trust in government. This finding sheds light on the far-reaching role of partisanship in Americans' interactions with the federal government.",

Most studies that show a partisan effect on non-political behaviors focus on interpersonal behaviors, such as perceptions of attractiveness (Nicholson et al. 2016) , mate choice (Iyengar et al. 2017; Huber and Malhotra 2012) , and employment (Gift and Gift 2015) .

Distrust of the government was an especially salient reason for working class Britons to resist smallpox vaccination (Durbach 2004) , illustrating how prior societal divisions which lead to differences in government trust can also lead to differential acceptance of government intervention.

However, there is significant debate on the extent of selective exposure.

Vaccination surveys, such as the National Immunization Survey (NIS), are used to craft public health policy in the US. In addition to directly surveying parents about their children's vaccination status, the NIS uses health provider vaccination records to validate parental responses. This methodology shows that parental survey responses and vaccination records have relatively high agreement. 1 Other studies also show that adult survey respondents tend to accurately report their own vaccination status (For examples, see Mac Donald et al.

Economic performance is a traditional marker of a president's performance, and as a result partisans are likely to answer those questions strategically.

Additionally, when tested separately, leaners behaved very similarly to partisans of the party they lean towards. This is not too surprising, as leaners often mirror weak partisans in their political behavior. 3 Partisanship is often correlated with factors such as gender and race that significantly influence risk perception.

In the case of the smallpox vaccine, Republicans were more likely to believe that the vaccine was safe, while in the cases of H1N1 and measles, the opposite was true. This finding supports the hypothesis that partisans are more likely to believe that vaccines are safe when their party holds the presidency. In two of the three cases, Independents were also significantly less likely to believe that the vaccine was safe, a finding that cannot be attributed to partisan cues.

(Ordered Logits). Government trust is a significant mediator of the partisan vaccination gap in perceptions of vaccine safety. In the case of MMR, the direct effect of partisanship is no longer significant 9 In the appendix, I also run two other models, one with a binomial probit as the mediator and a linear outcome, and the other with a linear mediator and binomial probit outcome, as well as the sensitivity analyses for these models. The binomial is coded as 0 for \"Not at all\" or \"not very\" confident, and 1 for \"somewhat\" or \"very\" confident. All three models (the only models for which sensitivity analysis is currently supported) provide very similar results in the size, significance, and sensitivity of the mediation effect. variables as linear variables rather than ordered factors, with \"Not confident at all\" coded as 1 and \"Very confident\" coded as 4. Figure 4 plots the mediation effect of government trust on the partisan gap in vaccine safety perceptions using the ordered logit models. In both cases, government trust significantly mediates the effect of partisanship on perceptions of safety.In the case of H1N1, government trust mediates approximately 34% of the total partisan effect. In the case of measles, government trust mediates approximately 58% of the total partisan effect. Figure 5 plots the same mediation effect using the linear models. As in the ordered logit models, government trust significantly mediates the partisan vaccination gap. Using this specification, government trust mediates approximately 34% of the total partisan effect on H1N1 vaccine safety, and 76% of the total partisan effect on MMR vaccine safety. A sensitivity analysis performed on these results using the methodology described by Imai et al. (2010) shows a of 0.3 for the H1N1 vaccine and a of 0.15 for the measles vaccine, suggesting a modest degree of sensitivity to unobserved pre-treatment covariates. 10 This section shows that government trust plays a powerful role in explaining partisan vaccination gaps. This provides additional support for my theory that partisanship shapes citizens' perceptions of their government's competence and trustworthiness, changing their willingness to comply with its recommendations. The next section looks at partisans' differential vaccination rates. 11 Partisan Willingness to Vaccinate. In all three cases, presidential co-partisans were more likely to vaccinate their children than presidential out-partisans. In the cases of smallpox and H1N1, the differences were large (over 10 % points), while in the case of MMR, the raw partisan difference was much more modest (about 1 percentage point) Figure 6 presents the raw percentage of partisans who would vaccinate themselves or their kids in the cases of smallpox, H1N1, and measles. In all three cases, presidential out-partisans (Dems for smallpox, Reps for H1N1 and measles) were less likely to report willingness to vaccinate than presidential co-partisans. Table 2 presents the binomial logit coefficient estimates on partisanship, confirming that the effect of partisanship on vaccination is statistically significant. I calculated predicted effect size similarly to the previous section. In the cases of smallpox and H1N1, presidential co-partisans were about 10 % points more likely to vaccinate than presidential out-partisans. For the measles vaccine, the effect size was closer to 3 % points. The difference in effect size may be the result of a number of factors, including the familiarity of the MMR vaccine, its' administration to children, or the question wording. 12 Now, while presidential co-partisans said they were more willing to vaccinate themselves and their children, was this an instance of cheap talk, or an indicator of genuine behavior? To test this question I relied on actual kindergarten vaccination and personal belief exemption data from the state of California over the course of the Bush and Obama administrations (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . Figure 7 shows the raw change in PBE rates for each school district in California from the Bush to the Obama administrations. While the most Democratic school In all three cases, presidential co-partisans were significantly more likely to vaccinate than presidential out-partisans. All three columns represent the results of a binomial logit regression. Full tables are in the appendix (regressions contain the following covariates: age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education) \u2020 p<0.1; * p < 0.05; * * p < 0.01 districts did not experience any increase in PBEs from the Bush to the Obama administration, the most Republican districts experienced an increase of about 3%. An effect of this magnitude represents a potentially serious public health problem, as it represents thousands of kindergartners missing out on vaccines. Some diseases, such as pertussis or measles, require 94% of a population to be vaccinated in order to achieve population immunity and prevent the spread of disease-a 3% (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) Presidential out-partisans became less likely to vaccinate after Obama was elected president. Both columns represent the coefficients of a binomial logit regression with random effects, with each child who received a PBE (1) or was vaccinated (2) as a 1, and otherwise a 0. Full tables are in the appendix (regressions contain the following school district level covariates: race/ethnicity, income, education) \u2020 p < 0.1; * p < 0.05; * * p < 0.01 increase in PBEs could easily put population immunity at risk. Table 3 confirms that after Obama's election, the increase in PBE rates was much larger in Republican school districts than in Democratic ones, as was the decline in vaccination rates. 13 Using both survey and behavioral data, this section has demonstrated that presidential co-partisans are significantly more likely to vaccinate themselves and their children than presidential out-partisans. Next, I will test three alternative non-partisan hypotheses to highlight the stability of the partisan effect on vaccination.",

It is reasonable to expect that areas with fewer vaccinated children will have more disease outbreaks. This, in turn, should motivate school officials to more strictly enforce vaccination regulations. Perhaps the most Democratic school districts were on the front end of the anti-vaccine trend, then faced increasing rates of vaccine-preventable disease, which caused their vaccination rates to rise? If the increase in disease (and subsequent stricter enforcement of vaccine regulations) occurred around 2008, the outcome would be observationally equivalent to a partisan effect.",

            "text": "In order to test this alternative hypothesis, I relied on county-level disease data from the California Health and Human Services Department. 14 To get the lagged vaccine preventable disease rate, I summed up the number of cases of Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Hepatitis B, and Varicella Hospitalizations for the prior year, and then divided by the total county population. As the dependent variable, I aggregated the school district vaccination and PBE rates to the county level, and used county-level demographic covariates. Otherwise, the regression specification was identical to the specification in the prior section (Table 3) . If partisan change in vaccination rates during the Obama administration is the effect of stricter vaccine enforcement in counties with high disease rates, including this variable in the regression should remove the significance on the Dem vote x Obama admin term. Table 4 shows the results of the binomial logit regression. Including the lagged disease rate variable does not substantively change the results -Republicans still became less likely to vaccinate and more likely to claim PBEs during the Obama administration. This result is also robust to model specification. Removing the interaction between Obama admin and lagged disease does not change the results, nor does lagging the disease rate at 0, 2, or 3 years instead of 1. Similarly, the Dem Vote x Obama Admin interaction is still significant if the lagged disease variable is completely removed. As such, it is unlikely that the partisan effect measured is the result of stricter vaccine enforcement in high-disease areas.",

            "text": "The second test concerns a potential \"catch up\" effect among under-vaccinated school districts. It is possible that given the rising concern around low vaccination rates, school district officials in districts with low rates began enforcing vaccination regulations more strictly even if they did not see an increase in disease outbreaks. 15 To test this hypothesis, I added a lagged vaccination rate/ PBE rate covariate to the regression presented in Table 3 , as well as an interaction between lagged vaccination \u00d7 Obama admin (in case the \"catch up\" period corresponded with the Obama administration). If the observed partisan effect is the result of under-vaccinated school districts \"catching up\", the interaction between Dem vote x Obama Admin should lose significance. Table 5 shows that for both vaccination rates and PBEs, including a lagged variable does not change the partisan effect. Changing the lag to 2 or 3 years does not change this result, nor does removing the interaction between Obama admin and the lagged variable. This means that it is unlikely that the partisan effect is the result of a \"catch up\" effect. Finally, as my third robustness test, I look at the relationship between income and vaccination rates. It is possible that anti-vaccine sentiment may have first been popular among richer households, and then spread to poorer ones (or vice versa). If the time period in which anti-vaccine sentiment became popular among different economic strata corresponded to the Obama administration, then the partisan effect I observe may be the result of wealth, not partisanship. To test this effect, I added an interaction term between Obama admin x median household income to the equation from Table 3 . If wealth is the true driver of the observed effect, the significance on the Obama x Dem vote coefficient should disappear. Table 6 shows that the Obama administration effect for presidential co-partisans still holds even when I allow for the possibility of a wealth effect. This means that it is unlikely that the observed partisan effect is the result of income effects.",

            "text": "Are presidential out-partisans less likely to comply with government recommendations? In the case of vaccination, the answer appears to be yes. Presidential out-partisans were significantly less likely to believe that vaccines were safe, and less likely to vaccinate their children than were presidential co-partisans. During the Bush administration, Democrats were both significantly more skeptical of the smallpox vaccine, and less likely to comply with mandatory school vaccination policies. During the Obama administration, the vaccination gap flipped and Republicans became more hostile to vaccines. These partisan differences in vaccine compliance were not the result of differential levels of worry about vaccine-preventable diseases, nor were they the result of stricter enforcement in under-vaccinated school districts. Instead, they could be largely attributed to partisan differences in perceptions of vaccine safety. Partisan differences in government trust significantly mediated partisan differences in perceptions of vaccine safety, These findings carry important implications for public health campaigns in the era of polarization. First, messaging around government vaccination recommendations is important. A bipartisan message encouraging the uptake of vaccines in response to a public health crisis will be more effective for increasing vaccination than a message disseminated only by officials of the current presidential administration. For example, the MMR vaccine demonstrated smaller partisan gaps than did either the smallpox or the H1N1 vaccine, likely due in part to its' consistent recommendation by both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations. Second, presidential messages have the potential to hurt vaccination rates, and administrations should carefully weigh whether the president's increased visibility outweighs the potential backlash from members of the opposing party if the president announces a public health crisis or explicitly recommends a vaccine. Finally, this finding suggests that, to whatever degree possible, government agencies such as the FDA and the CDC should emphasize their independence from partisan politics. If Americans begin to view these agencies through an explicitly partisan lens, this could have serious repercussions for vaccination initiatives in the US.",
