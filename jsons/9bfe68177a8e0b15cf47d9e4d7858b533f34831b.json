Spirometry performed by mobile device apps can also 211 be transmitted to physicians prior to telemedicine appointments. Trainees can learn how One of the more challenging aspects of supervising a telemedicine visit is to promote 298 clinical reasoning, elicit a differential diagnosis, and discuss the care plan while in front 299 of the patient. In a conventional encounter, the trainee would conduct the history and 300 physical, then leave the room to discuss the case with their attending. Some 301 telemedicine platforms allow providers to place their patients in waiting rooms, which 302 can be done while the case is discussed with the trainee. Alternatively, the encounter 303 can be closed, and the patient can be called back once the plan is formulated. A 304 preferred method which would enhance the learning process is to permit the trainee to 305 summarize and formulate their plan with the patient still in the visit. The attending can 306 either agree or explain why an alternative plan might be more appropriate. Faculty can 307 use this opportunity to detail their clinical reasoning to the patient to enhance 308 understanding of the treatment plan. Faculty consistently report evaluation fatigue; 309 however, telemedicine is appropriate for direct \"bedside rounds\" and performance Adequate supervision can easily be maintained as trainees are directly observed while 337 conducting their telemedicine visits. It is the duty of the supervising attending to provide 338 feedback to the trainee so that they can learn from each encounter. Trainees should 339 become proficient in telemedicine core competencies as detailed in Table 3 . Training in telemedicine can confer a significant educational benefit to Allergy-389 Immunology fellows. Prior to their initial telemedicine encounter with patients, they 390 should be given the opportunity to practice with standardized patients to gain familiarity 391 with telemedicine and to build confidence in their skills. Simulated standardized 392 telemedicine encounters at the end of training, even as a graduation requirement, allow 393 program faculty the opportunity to observe and assess how well a trainee can make 394 appropriate treatment decisions in real time as a factor in readiness for independent 395 practice.

Discussion of laboratory results, 173 review of asthma medication adherence, or triage of acute issues would be examples of 174 appropriate non-facilitated visits. Trainees need to be instructed on instances when a 175 patient should be evaluated in-person whether during an initial visit or for followoccur at a site distant to the allergist, but with the assistance of a 181 healthcare professional. In these visits, the patient travels to a nearby clinical space and 182 has a remote visit with the allergist while a facilitator, often a registered nurse or other 183 practitioner who may have obtained a telehealth facilitator certificate, performs the 184 physical exam. Specialized equipment, such as a digital otoscope or stethoscope, 185 transmits physical exam information to the telemedicine physician in real-time for a 186 more extensive exam than is possible with non-facilitated visits. Trainees will need to 187 learn how to direct a physical exam in a facilitated visit as well as troubleshoot technical 188 issues with the equipment in real time.

Subsequently, fellows can review their 214 interpretation of the spirometry with their attending for diagnostic verification and 215 consolidation of clinical reasoning in the virtual encounter as they would in person. monitoring captures and records patient physiologic data outside of the 220 clinic or hospital setting. This data is transmitted to health care providers for review, 221 diagnosis and clinical management. A clinical trial of remote patient monitoring of 222 asthma demonstrated improved asthma control and lung function with the use of remote 223 peak flow and symptom monitoring(14). Sensors that attach to patient's inhalers can 224 serve as monitoring for asthma medication adherence. Trainees should be educated on 225 the interpretation of remote patient monitoring data and how to incorporate it into their 226 patient care and education. Telemedicine training of fellows will require continual 227 adaptation to involve emerging technologies such as mHealth applications and consultations (e-consults) make use of communication within the electronic 233 health record to provide recommendations from a specialist to a patient's primary care 234 doctor or other treating specialist. E-consults can be used efficiently, particularly for 235 historical adverse drug reactions and immunodeficiency consultations, in an expedited 236 manner streamlining timely access to necessary care from specialists(15). Trainees 237 should be educated on performing e-consults for ordering testing in advance of a visit, 238 planning skin testing or oral challenge testing in a subsequent visit, second opinions, 239 and appropriately guiding a referring provider on interim management prior to evaluation 240 in a telemedicine or in person Allergy-Immunology visit. Trainees should be given the 241 opportunity to respond to e-consults, initially with substantial attending oversight and 242 then with growing independence. As e-consults can reduce unnecessary overutilization 243 of healthcare services, trainees should be well versed in how to incorporate these 244 encounters into their future practice. 245 246 Electronic messages from patients can also serve as training tools for common Allergy-247 Immunology questions. Patient queries can give trainees the opportunity to carefully 248 consider responses to key practice questions and review the evidence-base for decision 249 making without the immediacy required during a scheduled visit. Practice with electronic 250 message management during fellowship training can aid trainees in efficient time 251 management for their future clinical practice. 252 253 Supervision of Telemedicine Visits 254 255 The COVID-19 pandemic has brought telemedicine and telehealth services to the 256 forefront of healthcare(4). Many practices are struggling to adapt to these changes, and 257 training programs face the challenge of educating trainees in a virtual environment and 258 creating instructional modules to train supervisors in the use of telemedicine and 259 telehealth systems. The AAAAI and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and 260 Immunology have shared resources and guides for practices to assist them through this 261 transition period(16). It is beneficial for attendings to familiarize themselves with 262 telemedicine tools so they can better instruct their trainees how to utilize them. 263 264 Whether in-person or via telemedicine, the history and physical exam remain the core of 265 the patient visit. Telemedicine offers the unique opportunity to supervise trainees from 266 the medical student to the fellow level. Most trainees will not have their own 267 telemedicine account and will rely on their supervising attending's access to the 268 telemedicine platform. The attending physician or clinic staff can schedule the 269 appointment and inquire if the patient (and the parent/guardian, if appropriate) would be 270 agreeable to having a trainee join their session in advance, or seek permission for the 271 trainee to participate in the telemedicine visit at the start of the visit with the trainee on a 272 group video chat. Once consent has been obtained the encounter can proceed. 273 274 While the appointment format may appear different, the same etiquette rules govern 275 each encounter. Trainees are expected to wear appropriate attire and maintain the 276 same level of professionalism throughout the meeting as they would for an in-person 277 visit. Each encounter must begin with introductions and consent, from either the patient 278 or parent/guardian in the case of a child who has not reached the age of consent, to 279 continue with the appointment should be obtained. For pediatric patients, discussion of 280 optimal camera positioning to discuss with both the child and adult may be necessary. 281 Throughout the visit, eye-contact should be maintained with the patient and their 282 patient/guardian when appropriate. The interview should be conducted in the same 283 manner as an in-person encounter. The AAAAI has published resources on how to 284 conduct a professional telemedicine visit that can be utilized by trainees(17). 285 286 During a trainee's first few sessions, they may benefit from observing the attending 287 while they conduct the interview and physical exam. The trainee can conduct 288 subsequent patient encounters. While the patient is not physically present, a physical 289 exam can and should be performed. There is a lot of information that can be obtained 290 from observing the patient, such as their general appearance, orientation, respiratory 291 effort, movement, and affect. Parents can be taught to perform specific portions of the 292 exam, such as the abdominal exam, on their children. Certain elements, such as 293 rashes, can be determined on a case by case basis depending on the quality of the 294 equipment used to conduct the exam. If necessary, a trainee can state 'deferred' or 295 'recommend in-office evaluation'. 296 297",

Proper telemedicine etiquette would be to invite the patient to end the visit first 315 to ensure they are finished discussing their concerns. Once the visit is concluded, the 316 trainee can complete the documentation within the guidelines of their healthcare 317 system. While the core elements of a patient's note do not change, many healthcare 318 systems have their own modifications to acknowledge that the visit was conducted 319 through telemedicine. In particular, the trainee should document the modality of 320 telemedicine that was employed, who was present during the visit, the location of the 321 patient and the physician, any technical interruptions, and the attending physician 322 should document their presence and supervision during key portions of the encounter. 323The same responsibilities they have for in-person visits apply to these encounters, 324including following up on laboratory results and diagnostic studies and contacting any 325 primary care/specialty offices. The same billing and coding requirements which apply to 326 traditional in-office visits apply to telemedicine, with the exception of statereview should be conducted after each visit for training purposes. The teaching 330standards and scope of practice should be consistent with existing in-person sessions. 331Additionally, patients can provide near real-time feedback after their visits with a brief 332 survey or comments. Digital patient feedback may be reviewed with trainees to provide 333 additional training on practice based learning and professionalism. Prior to incorporating 334 trainees into clinic, it would be advisable to perform training simulations so they can 335 understand the benefits, limitations, and scope of telemedicine and telehealth visits.",

Many new trainees feel unprepared to utilize 345 telemedicine effectively(8). There are portions of the physical exam that cannot be 346 performed virtually, and the patient may still have to travel to obtain labs and other 347 diagnostic studies. Consideration should be given to the socioeconomic status and the 348 resources patients have available, such as internet service, video and audio equipment, 349 and language or visual difficulties(3) as these may be barriers to utilization. Patients 350 may be distrustful of telemedicine (18), and some patients may have difficulty adopting 351 telemedicine services(18). Some barriers can be overcome by educating patients about 352 the benefits and safety of telemedicine, and by providing them with step by step 353 instructions on how to access it. As rules and regulations surrounding delivery of 354 telemedicine services change, the cost-barriers to accessing telemedicine are likely to 355 be reduced. Many hospital systems already have a telephone interpreter or facilitator 356 services to assist in language translation. These services can be incorporated into a 357 patient visit and utilized to accommodate the hearing and visually impaired. Trainees 358 should be educated on how to accommodate these requests and seek guidance from 359 their attending physician. 360 361 Telemedicine or in-person visits may be utilized to establish care. In-person visits may 362 be preferable if a physical exam or procedure is necessary to render a correct 363 diagnosis, such as examination of the nasal cavity for polyps or spirometry for a new 364 diagnosis of asthma. Fellows must be trained to identify situations that require an in-365 person evaluation even if the patient would prefer a telemedicine visit. For example, 366 specific IgE testing for allergic conditions could be performed either in anticipation of, or 367 after a telemedicine encounter, and can be reviewed virtually, whereas allergy skin 368 testing may be needed for certain conditions such as penicillin allergy. In contrast, 369 pulmonary function tests, exhaled nitric oxide, and patch testing can only be performed 370 during in-person clinic visits. Discussions about food and drug allergy may be 371 appropriate for a telemedicine visit, but skin testing and oral or graded-dose challenges 372 must be performed in a setting with an attending physician personally supervising the 373 procedure due to the risk of anaphylaxis. Facilitated telemedicine visits with a non-374 physician healthcare professional would not be appropriate for procedures which carry a 375 risk of anaphylaxis. Although it would not be appropriate for trainees to supervise nurse 376 practitioners or physician assistants directly, trainees could participate in facilitated 377 interactions whereby the attending Allergy-Immunology specialist is overseeing a low-378 risk procedure with a nurse practitioner or physician assistant for education 379 purposes(19). Situations that would not be appropriate for continued monitoring via 380 telemedicine include new or worsening symptoms despite initial treatment. Evaluation of 381 certain allergic conditions such as assessment of nasal polyps, rhinoscopy, evaluation 382 of tympanic membranes is not possible via telemedicine. Other scenarios where the 383 physical exam may change the course of disease management such as a detailed skin 384 or genital exam in the setting of primary immunodeficiency, pulmonary exam, or 385 evaluation of new lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly in hypereosinophilic 386 syndromes would be better suited for an in-person visit. 387 388",

            "text": "recently, the majority of didactics in Allergy-Immunology programs employed in-403 person, content-based learning for didactic lessons for trainees. Advancements in adult 404 learning methods have blossomed with approaches such as the flipped classroom, 405 which blends online instruction, traditional homework, and experiential learning, where 406 students learn through reflections on their experiences(20,21). Virtual learning 407 approaches are on the rise in the Allergy-Immunology community with recorded 408 lectures, webinars, podcasts, and other national resources. Despite these offerings, 409 implementation of virtual learning experiences into Allergy-Immunology fellowship 410 programs has been slow as most graduate medical education programs continue to 411 employ \"community of practice\" models in a small or large group classroom type setting. 412 In March 2020, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sudden need to 413 shift training to the virtual classroom. In-Training Exams were moved to remote 414 monitored exams, and programs reported moving didactics such as Journal Clubs to 415 virtual classrooms(22). Enduring e-learning instructional content can be created that can 416 be widely shared. One can imagine the virtual classroom toppling institutional silos and 417 bringing greater access to unique training opportunities across the nation. Examples 418 include the ACAAI/COLA lectures(23) shared on YouTube and regional videocast 419 conferences in the DC-Maryland-Virginia area for complex immunodeficiency cases 420 seen in Primary Immunodeficiency Clinic as models for collaborative educational 421 endeavors. The move to virtual education may facilitate increased interaction, draw 422 upon unique strengths of individual training programs, and can create a nationwide 423 community of Allergy-Immunology learners. 424 425 Virtual methods can easily recapitulate standard teaching methods such as presenting 426 virtual patient cases, simulation-based learning, and conducting case conferences via 427 videoconference. Trainees can even stand in front of a \"virtual poster\" via technology 428 platforms with screen-sharing ability to present their research. Available technology 429 allows for new avenues of collaboration such as the use of team-based applications for 430 collaborative writing assignments, curriculum development, and clinical trial or grant 431 writing exercises. 432 433 Finally, virtual communication can enhance team mentoring for Allergy-Immunology 434 trainees. The traditional, single mentee to single mentor pairing is slowly being replaced 435 by team-mentoring approaches that allow trainees greater access to a more diverse 436 mentoring experience. A move to the virtual environment may facilitate greater 437 networking opportunities via social media networks or facilitative networking across 438 institutions via videoconferencing initiated by program directors to meet trainee an unprecedented opportunity to teach and evaluate the 445 clinical skills of trainees. At the beginning of their fellowship, trainees should participate 446 in simulation telemedicine cases to introduce the technology, stereotypic Allergy-447 Immunology case scenarios and to model appropriate virtual etiquette. At the 448 completion of their training, supervising faculty can utilize telemedicine encounters to 449 directly assess trainees' clinical reasoning, professionalism, and communication skills 450 and assure a more precise assessment of the core competencies with direct 451 observation using telemedicine. 452 453 resources 54431.

Desktop computers, laptops and 97 mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones may be used for telemedicine visits. The 98 capabilities of these products and their applications with the different options and IT 99 support should be discussed. The use of screenshots and video and/or audio recording 100 should be strictly prohibited, unless there is informed consent from the patient for 101 teaching or research purposes. 102Trainees will require education on patient privacy, particularly if they are engaging in 104 telemedicine encounters from their home. The trainee should ensure that they are the 105 only person working from the device and that the device has proper protection, such as106 a screen protector to prevent content from being viewed by a passersby. The 107 telemedicine visits should be conducted in a private room. Listening devices, such as 108 the Amazon Echo or Google Home, should be removed or turned off and the trainee 109 should wear headphones if conducting the visit from home and there is a risk of the 110 patient being overheard. In addition, the trainee should be educated on how to initiate 111 privacy discussions regarding their own and the patient's environment. Trainees should 112 be educated concerning the need for end-to-end encryption of all data and messages 113 that are transmitted. 114 Studies have shown that there is a lack of understanding of the laws governing 116 telemedicine amongst trainees(8). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory 117 bodies have relaxed previous requirements for a pre-existing patient-physician 118 relationship for engaging in telemedicine services(9). Individual states have temporarily 119 relaxed state requirements for licensure, both for telemedicine and direct practice(10). 120 Changes to telemedicine enacted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 121 (CMS) during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency as of May 6 th 2020 are shown in 122Table 1; however, rules and waivers continue to evolve in a changing practice 123environment. An understanding of contemporary rules and regulatory requirements, as 124 well as the ability to locate key resources to track evolving federal and state rules and 125 regulations for training fellows in operational considerations are important. Some key 126 resources are shown inTable 2. As laws that govern interstate medical licensing 127 evolve, new opportunities will arise to provide additional training opportunities and 128 experiences for trainees. 129The initial didactic curriculum should ensure that trainees are able to recognize the 131 different types of telemedicine encounters available, synchronous and asynchronous, 132 with the advantages and limitations of each. 133Synchronous visits are real-time video conferences between the physician, trainee, and 137 the patient in a medical consultation similar to the in-person setting. As these can be 138 either facilitated or non-facilitated visits, trainees must be adept in both types of 139 encounters and which is preferred for particular circumstances. Telephone visits, 140 without video capabilities, can be utilized if the patient does not have access to video 141 equipment; however, this may provide greater limitations on the telehealth visit. 142",
