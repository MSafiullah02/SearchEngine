As human beings derive ever more food from the sea yet persist in destroying the nurseries that supply that harvest, local and global fisheries have begun to collapse.5 Since two-thirds of the world's population depends on fish as their main source of protein,6 continued destruction of marine ecosystems will probably have a severe effect on human health worldwide.",

In particular, the zoonotic transfer of a disease from another avian or mammalian species to human beings has become increasingly common, accounting for 75% of the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases recorded in the past decade.7 Prominent examples of zoonotic diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Lyme disease, which have affected thousands of people and resulted in economic losses of tens of billions of US dollars.8, 9 Other pathogens, such as West Nile, Ebola, and Nipah viruses, may have a growing, harmful effect on human health. Notwithstanding their impact and the attention they garner, the ecology of many zoonotic diseases remains understudied and poorly understood. For example, whereas civet cats found in markets in China have been identified as harbouring SARS, the species that serves as the reservoir for the SARS virus has not yet been determined. However, scientists have linked the reduction of mammalian biodiversity with increased likelihood of human cases of Lyme disease,10 but responses to the disease are still focused on individual treatment rather than better land use and wildlife-management policies that might stem the spread of Lyme and possibly other new pathogens.",

Second, countries need to correct market failures and remove distortions that exacerbate environmental degradation. Thus, wherever possible, countries should phase out damaging subsidies that overcapitalise industries such as farming, fishing, and forestry, and that promote inefficiencies, overextraction, and environmental damage. Third, we underscore the importance of improving our knowledge about the environment\u2014including the crucially under-researched environment\u2013health links\u2014and to make this information effectively available to senior decision-makers through science-advice mechanisms. Moreover, environmental education and training must be integrated into the curricula of primary and secondary schools worldwide to improve the public's understanding of the environment.20 Finally, efficiency gains through advanced science and technologies directed at environmental challenges can slow the rise in demand for certain ecosystem services.
