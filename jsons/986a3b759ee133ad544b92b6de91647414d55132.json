The role of hMPV in causing respiratory tract infections in Kuwait was not yet investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait among patients with respiratory tract infection with respect to other respiratory viruses. During January-December 2009, 460 respiratory samples from 388 patients with respiratory tract infection were collected from different hospitals. They were tested for hMPV RNA by real-time PCR, and for other respiratory viruses by conventional PCR. Out of 388 patients, 110 (28%) were positive for viral respiratory infections; 21 (5.4%) were positive for hMPV, 29 (7.5%) were positive for rhinovirus, 13 (4%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus, and 10 (3%) were positive for adenovirus. Most (n \u00bc 19, 90.5%) of hMPV-positive patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 76% of them were of age 2 years and below, and 24% of age 59 years and above. All hMPV-positive elderly patients had pneumonia while 50% of hMPV-positive infants had bronchopneumonia. Children with hMPV/rhinovirus co-infection (n \u00bc 3, 1%) had recurrent chest infection and frequent intensive care unit admission. The hMPV infection was mostly detected between December and May, and genotype B was more prevalent than genotype A. This is the first study demonstrating the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait, and suggests that hMPV infection is prevalent in infants and elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection.",

Symptoms such as fever, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, and hypoxia are frequently observed in infected children, and in children with a clinical syndrome consistent with bronchiolitis, hyperinflation, as well as focal infiltrates and peribronchial cuffing [Williams et al., 2004] . Some reports have shown that hMPV infection is associated with encephalitis, and there is at least one example where hMPV was detected in a patient who died of complications associated with encephalitis [Schildgen et al., 2005] . In addition, some studies have reported a hospital-acquired hMPV infection in infants, children, and elderly patients in long-term care facilities [Chano et al., 2005; Honda et al., 2006; Boivin et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009] .",

Most of the hMPV-positive patients (76%) were infants having less than 2 years, while 24% of them were patients having 59 years and above, and the overall prevalence of hMPV infection in infants and elderly was 11 and 8%, respectively. The hMPV infection was not detected among children aged more than 2 years and adults aged less than 59 years. Most of the hMPV-positive patients (90%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; the overall proportion of hMPV infection in patients admitted to intensive care unit was 8%. The hMPV was only detected in the following types of respiratory samples: Endotracheal tube secretions (30%), tracheal aspirate (30%), nasopharyngeal aspirate (30%), and nasopharyngeal swab (10%). The difference in the hMPV RNA load among different types of respiratory samples was not significant. All hMPV-positive patients had lower respiratory tract infections with high detectable RNA load. All elderly patients (n \u00bc 5) had pneumonia, while 50% (n \u00bc 8) of infants less than 2 years had bronchopneumonia, 25% (n \u00bc 4) had pneumonia, and 13% (n \u00bc 2) had acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. The median hMPV RNA load for each group of patients according to their clinical data was as the following: 1.76 \u00c2 10 6 copies/ml for patients with pneumonia, 4.08 \u00c2 10 7 copies/ml for patients with bronchopneumonia, and 2.31 \u00c2 10 8 copies/ml for patients presented with acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. In addition, one patient with bronchiolitis had hMPV RNA load of 7.68 \u00c2 10 7 copies/ml, and one with respiratory distress had 4.48 \u00c2 10 6 copies/ml. The difference in the viral load between each group of patients with lower respiratory tract infection was not significant (P \u00bc 0.55).

The genotype of hMPV RNA detected was identified by direct sequencing. Eleven hMPV RT-PCR products could be sequenced showing high similarity with hMPV sequences available in the GenBank database. Two hMPV genotypes were detected, A subgroup 2b and B subgroup 2; although genotype B2 was more prevalent than A2b (Table IV) . The hMPV infection was detected during winter and spring seasons ( Fig. 1) , with high incidence rate in spring, and with very low incidence during summer (P \u00bc 0.005).",

Not surprising, most of respiratory samples collected in this study were from infants less than 2 years, showing that the most affected age group vulnerable for respiratory infections is infants. Infants are considered to be at high risk for respiratory infections, since their immunity system is being progressively developed during their first 2 years [File, 2000] . Respiratory infections are considered as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries [Campbell, 1995] , and this agrees with our observation that most of the respiratory samples (65%) were collected from patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute lower respiratory tract infections.",

These results are in agreement with a previous study done in Kuwait showing that respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus were the major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in Kuwait [Khadadah et al., 2010] . In addition, the best respiratory samples for hMPV detection were endotracheal tube secretions, tracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate followed by nasopharyngeal swab, whereas hMPV RNA was not detected in throat swab, nasal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage and pleural fluid. This support earlier studies which recommended nasopharyngeal aspirate and swabs specimens for hMPV detection [Van den Hoogen et al., 2001 , 2004a . The prevalence of hMPV infection among the study population was 5.4%. Previous studies have reported that it accounts for at least 5 to 7% of the respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children, and at least 3% in the general community of patients who visit a general practitioner for respiratory tract infections [Van den Hoogen et al., 2004b] . Most of the hMPV-positive patients were of age 2 years and less (76%), and of age 59 years and above (24%), and these results parallel most if not all studies that have shown that hMPV is a common disease in children and can cause severe infections in the elderly [Falsey et al., 2003; Wolf et al., 2003; Principi et al., 2006; Hermos et al., 2010] . In Qatar the hMPV virus was the most commonly detected virus, accounting for 74% of all respiratory infections among pediatric patients aged 1 month to 5 years, and this result is very similar to the current study finding that most of hMPV-positive patients were of age 2 years and less than 76% [Al-Thani et al., 2010] . Our results highlight the importance to introduce a screening test for hMPV infection in routine diagnosis, and to have appropriate medical management for hMPV-positive cases as other studies have recommended previously [Deffrasnes et al., 2007] . Moreover, the clinical data of hMPV-positive patients have shown that all elderly people presented with pneumonia mainly, while infants presented with a variety of clinical syndromes such as bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma and bronchiolitis, a finding which has also been observed in previous studies [Boivin et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2004] . In this context, a study conducted on 10 elderly patients with underlying illness, has shown that four patients had developed pneumonitis and two have died due to hMPV infection [Boivin et al., 2002] .",

Some previous reports have shown a co-infection of hMPV/respiratory syncytial virus, which correlated with the severity of infection [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005] . On the other hand, other studies have shown that hMPV/respiratory syncytial virus coinfection may normally be rare in most populations [Mackay et al., 2006] , while some publications have failed to detect this co-infection [Esper et al., 2003; Al-Sonboli et al., 2006; Van Woensel et al., 2006 ]. Furthermore, some recent studies have found co-infection of hMPV with SARS-coronavirus and human bocavirus [Choi et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007] . The coinfection of hMPV/rhinovirus might be responsible for the severe symptoms presented by our patients. Indeed, one 2-years-old female had high hMPV RNA load (4.62 \u00c2 10 8 copies/ml) and presented with acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. A male infant aged 2 months had recurrent chest infection with frequent intensive care unit admission, and his hMPV viral load was high (1.76 \u00c2 10 6 copies/ml). The last patient was a 1-year-old female with recurrent chest infection and frequent intensive care unit admission, and her hMPV RNA load was high (5.73 \u00c2 10 8 copies/ml). This suggests that the presence of hMPV infection with other respiratory virus may complicate the clinical condition and prolong patient stay in the hospital, as it has been reported earlier [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2010] . The high viral load of hMPV detected in our patients with lower respiratory tract infection may suggest a correlation between the severity of clinical symptoms and the virus replication rate, as described elsewhere [Boivin et al., 2002; Gerna et al., 2007; Bosis et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2010] .",

Sequence analysis has shown that both genotypes A and B circulate in Kuwait, with predominance of B2 subgroup. Genotype A has been reported as the predominant genotype in respiratory samples [Bastien et al., 2003; Boivin et al., 2003; Maggi et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003] , but other studies have documented the presence of both genotypes A and B [Huck et al., 2006; Regev et al., 2006; Matsuzaki et al., 2008] . The seasonal distribution of hMPV infection during the year 2009 indicates that hMPV infection incidence is high in winter and peaks during spring with almost no infection detected during summer. These results are not different from those of previous observations that have found high level of hMPV detection in the spring and winter months [Sugrue et al., 2008; Ali et al., 2010] .",
