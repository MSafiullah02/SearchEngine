They give responders an indication\nof what real-time data to collect, or what to watch for, to either validate the\nplanning assumptions or signal that a change in approach is needed. For example, an\nassumption used in influenza pandemic planning posits that the novel influenza virus\nwill be transmitted from person to person in the same way seasonal influenza is\ntransmitted. Healthcare providers will thus know what Infection Prevention and\nControl (IPC) precautions to utilize, which builds confidence in responders when\ndealing with unknowns.

Assumptions can be used as a starting point to\ncreate scenarios against which risks and capabilities can be identified and\nassessed. For example, a planning scenario might include a person who presents to\nthe emergency department complaining of nausea, weakness, and fever. To prepare for\nuncertainty, planners must consider variables in the scenario. For example, if this\nperson had recently returned from a country with an ongoing Ebola outbreak, would\nthe existing triage system be sufficient to identify, assess, and rapidly contain a\npossible Ebola case? This type of assessment helps identify specific risks, such as\nnot including Ebola in the intake differential diagnosis for ill travellers\nreturning from an affected area.
