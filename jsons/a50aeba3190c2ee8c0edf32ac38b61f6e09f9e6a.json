In addition, they noted that the radiologic findings of hMPV infections were most commonly reported in patients with hematologic malignancy, but there were limited data on immunocompetent patients. 9 The time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission may affect radiologic findings. In our study, among patients with normal CR, which were LRSI-based on their clinical findings, time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was lower (2.5 to 3.6 days; P = 0.05 antibiotic prescription rate was still high, which was 54% among patients with LRSI.",

The rate of hospitalization among the children was 46% (31 out of 67 patients), while it was 64% (21 out of 33 patients) among adult patients. Among the hospitalized patients, the rate of LRSI was 68% (21 out of 31 patients) in children and 86% (18 out of 21 patients) in adults. Among patients with LRSI, comorbid disease was seen in 50%; however, among patients with URSI, comorbid disease was detected in 22% (P = 0.16). The mean leukocyte, C reactive protein (CRP), and PCT levels on admission were 8.496/\u03bcL (3.4 to 17.29), 38.9 mg/L (5.3 to 193), and 0.1 ng/mL (0.04 to 0.28) in adults and 11.251/\u03bcL (3.72 to 25), 36.45 mg/L (0.5 to 218), and 0.38 ng/mL (0.06 to 1.2) in children. In total, LRSI was diagnosed in 44 patients with clinical findings, and in 31 patients out of 44, radiological findings supported the diagnosis. Thirty-nine out of 44 LRSI were hospitalized, and five were followed up in the outpatient department. The LRSI rate was significantly higher in adults than children (66.7%-32.8%; we compared monoviral or polyviral infections in terms of the presence of LRSI, there was no significant difference (46% in monoviral to 31% in polyviral; P = 0.26). Radiological imaging, including CR and/or CT, was done among 34 patients, and radiologic LRSI findings were detected in 31 out of 34 patients. The CR was used among 28 patients: 11 of them were adults and 17 were children. Among the children, radiologic findings were detected in 76% of patients; among the adults, it was seen in 45% of the patients (P = 0.094). Among patients with LRSI, CR was normal in 10 patients and radiologic findings were detected in 18 patients. Among patients with normal CR, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 2.5 days; however among patients with abnormal CR, it was 3.6 days (P = 0.05). In CR, peribronchovascular infiltration (PI) was the most common feature seen in 14 out of 18 patients and radiological infiltrations were generally bilateral (13 out of 18 patients; Figure 3). The CT was performed among 17 adult patients. In CT imaging, GGO was the most common finding, seen in 11 out of 17 patients (65%) and nodular consolidation in five out of 17 patients (29%). Centrilobular nodules were detected in seven out of 17 patients (41%; Demographic features and outcomes of the patients",
