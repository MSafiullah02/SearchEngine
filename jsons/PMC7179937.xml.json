Genomic sequencing showed that this pathogenic coronavirus is 96.2% identical to a bat coronavirus and shares 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV (4\u20136). This novel coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and the pneumonia was designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 (7). The epidemic spread rapidly to more than 212 countries and was announced as a global health emergency by WHO (8). No clinically effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs are currently available for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. The combination of \u03b1-interferon and the anti-HIV drugs Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae) has been used, but the curative effect remains very limited and there can be toxic side effects (9). Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., is also being explored for the treatment of COVID-19, but more data are needed to prove its efficacy (10\u201312). Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with efficiency and safety are urgently needed.",

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The genomic RNA of CoVs is approximately 30 k nt in length with a 5\u2032-cap structure and 3\u2032-poly-A tail, and contains at least 6 open reading frames (ORFs) (13, 14). The first ORF (ORF 1a/b), about two-third of genome length, directly translates two polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab, because there is an a-1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b. These polyproteins are processed by a main protease (Mpro), also known as the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), and one or two papain-like proteases (PLPs), into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). These nsps engage in the production of subgenomic RNAs that encode four main structural proteins (envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins) and other accessory proteins (15, 16). Therefore, these proteases, especially Mpro, play a vital role in the life cycle of coronavirus.",

Mpro is conserved among CoVs and several common features are shared among the substrates of Mpro in different CoVs. The amino acids in substrates from the N terminus to C terminus are numbered as fellows (-P4-P3-P2-P1\u2193P1\u2032-P2\u2032-P3\u2032-), and the cleavage site is between the P1 and P1\u2032. In particular, a Gln residue is almost always required in the P1 position of the substrates. There is no human homolog of Mpro which makes it an ideal antiviral target (20\u201322).",

By analyzing the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro (PDB ID: 2H2Z), novel inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1). The thiol of a cysteine residue in the S1\u2032 sites anchors inhibitors by a covalent linkage that is important for the inhibitors to maintain antiviral activity. In our design of new inhibitors, an aldehyde was selected as a new warhead in P1 in order to form a covalent bond with cysteine. The reported SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors often have an (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring that occupies the S1 site of Mpro, and this ring was expected to be a good choice in P1 (23). Furthermore, the S2 site of coronavirus Mpro is usually large enough to accommodate the bigger P2 fragment. To test the importance of different ring systems, a cyclohexyl or 3-fluorophenyl were introduced in P2, with the fluorine expected to enhance activity. An indole group was introduced into P3 in order to form new hydrogen bonds with S4 and improve drug-like properties.",

Details of the interaction are shown in Fig. 3, B and C. The electron density shows that the C of the aldehyde group of 11a and the catalytic site Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro form a standard 1.8-\u00c5 C\u2013S covalent bond. The oxygen atom of the aldehyde group also plays a crucial role in stabilizing the conformations of the inhibitor by forming a 2.9-\u00c5 hydrogen bond with the backbone of residues Cys145 in the S1\u2032 site. The (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring of 11a at P1 fits well into the S1 site. The oxygen of the (S)-\u03b3-lactam group forms a 2.7-\u00c5 hydrogen bond with the side chain of His163. The main chain of Phe140 and side chain of Glu166 also participate in stabilizing the (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring by forming 3.2-\u00c5 and 3.0-\u00c5 hydrogen bonds with its NH group, respectively. In addition, the amide bonds on the chain of 11a are hydrogen-bonded with the main chains of His164 (3.2 \u00c5) and Glu166 (2.8 \u00c5), respectively. The cyclohexyl moiety of 11a at P2 deeply inserts into the S2 site, stacking with the imidazole ring of His41. The cyclohexyl group is also surrounded by the side chains of Met49, Tyr54, Met165, Asp187 and Arg188, producing extensive hydrophobic interactions. The indole group of 11a at P3 is exposed to solvent (S4 site) and is stabilized by Glu166 through a 2.6-\u00c5 hydrogen bond. The side chains of residues Pro168 and Gln189 interact with the indole group of 11a through hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, multiple water molecules (named W1-W6) play an important role in binding 11a. W1 interacts with the amide bonds of 11a through a 2.9-\u00c5 hydrogen bond, whereas W2-6 form a number of hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde group of 11a and the residues of Asn142, Gly143, Thr26, Thr25, His41 and Cys44, which contributes to stabilizing 11a in the binding pocket.",

Compared with the cyclohexyl group in 11a, the 3-fluorophenyl group undergoes a significant downward rotation (Fig. 3D). The side chains of residues His41, Met49, Met165, Val186, Asp187 and Arg188 interact with this aryl group through hydrophobic interactions and the side chain of Gln189 stabilizes the 3-fluorophenyl group with an additional 3.0-\u00c5 hydrogen bond (Fig. 3, E and F).

Considering the danger of COVID-19, we selected the intravenous drip administration to further study for the reason that value of the area under the curve (AUC) is high and the effect is rapid.
