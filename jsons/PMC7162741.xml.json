            "text": "Currently, there are 1.2 million physician Healthcare Workers (HCWs) in the United States (US), 20% over the age of 55 [2]. Similarly, in the hospital setting, there are 2 million registered nurses, with 22% are over the age of 55 and of the 1.2 million registered nurses employed outside of the hospital, 29% are over the age of 55 [1]. According to the CDC, older adults are at higher risk of infection and complications related to COVID-19, particularly those over the age of 65, the age group that currently comprises 8 out of 10 US deaths from COVID 19 [2]. All ages are susceptible to COVID-19, with close contact with an infected individual [3]. Given this assessment, physicians, nurses and other staff risk their personal health each time they tend to COVID-19 patients and this is made worse by the shortage of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). Lack of PPE and inadequate social distancing are the two modifiable risk factors that if addressed through the implementation of enforced physical distancing, increasing the availability of PPEs, and proper guidelines would significantly reduce transmission rates and help save lives [4,5]. In March 2020, Italy reported over 2600 HCWs were infected, devastating their already worn-down workforce [6]. Observing the wreckage ensuing across the globe, it is imperative to better prepare and care for our HCWs.",

The effects of this increase in workload in the dangerous atmosphere of this pandemic are the decline in the mental health of our HCW [16,17]. Throughout this pandemic HCWs have had to self-isolate from their own families for fear of transmitting the virus to their loved ones [17]. There will be guilt when a family member becomes infected. Our HCWs are bravely living in a constant state of psychological stress founded in fear; fear of transmitting the virus and stress of the unknown aspects of this virus. The long-term effects of stress can result in post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression [19].

Keeping our HCWs updated on the latest information diminishes the fear of uncertainty and negative emotions associated with the virus [20]. This entails frequent information sessions on the specific details of the virus, practicing ethical decision making, and how to effectively use hospital resources [19]. By ensuring that the entire team maintains the same understanding of information and protocols, a certain amount of order can be maintain to curtail the negative impacts of this crisis. Additionally, establishing break time will allow for HCWs time to take care of themselves. Another recommendation centers on creating healthcare staff reserves to relieve those on duty before exhaustion and strain sets in resulting in anxiety and depression, affecting the quality of healthcare delivery. This can be done in several ways, including incorporating outside registered nurses into the hospital system, re-employing HCWs who recently retired, and adding in the newly matched fourth year medical students. As this crisis progresses it is imperative to continue to evaluate the well-being of our HCW and implement effect measures to care for their mental health.",
