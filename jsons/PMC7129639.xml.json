They estimated that expanding treatment centres on Oct 15 could have prevented 137 432 cases by Dec 15. By contrast, they predicted 170 996 cases over the same period if treatment was not expanded. During that time (106 days), therefore, their projections argue that an additional 4800 beds would have treated 33 564 patients. In fact, this was a ten times overprojection.",
