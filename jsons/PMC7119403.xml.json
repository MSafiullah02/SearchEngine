Preschool children can have 5\u20139 respiratory tract infections per year, the majority of which are caused by these viruses.[5]Virtually all preschool children will contract infections with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are also frequent causes of respiratory illness. It is likely that, by adulthood, all individuals will have been infected by virtually all the viruses listed in Table 1.6, 7, 8, 9In addition, repeated infection with RSV and influenza is very common because of either incomplete immunity resulting from primary infection (i.e., RSV) or antigenic variation of the virus itself (i.e., influenza).",

Therefore, infection by common respiratory viruses may present differently in this population than in immunocompetent individuals. Since most adults with HIV disease acquired their infection as adults or adolescents, they probably have experienced infections by most of the common respiratory viruses and thus have some pre-existing immunity. For this reason, respiratory viral infections may be a greater clinical problem in HIV-infected infants and children, who may not have pre-existing immunity to these pathogens. Clearance of respiratory viruses is likely to depend on cellular immune mechanisms, and HIV-infected individuals are at theoretical risk for prolonged infections caused by these viruses.",

Asymptomatic RSV infection was documented for at least 3 weeks in an HIV-infected child recovering from severe LRTI associated with parainfluenza type 3 and other pathogens.[23]Finally, in a prospective birth cohort study that specifically addressed respiratory viruses, the severity of RSV illness was similar in HIV- and non-HIV-infected children.[24]In this study, no deaths were associated with 10 RSV infections in eight HIV-infected children.
