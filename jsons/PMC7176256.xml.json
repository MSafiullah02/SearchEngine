One of the factors underlying the fast growth of this discipline is the commonly held belief that the frequency of URTIs is high in elite athletes after a single bout and/or during periods of intense training [3, 4]. On the other hand, URTIs, usually described as the common cold, are the most frequent occurring illness among humans worldwide. More than 200 viruses cause URTI with influenza, rhinovirus, and coronaviruses being the most common [5].",

The term J-curve is used in several fields, which, in our case, describes the relationship between exercise intensity and susceptibility to infections [8, 9]. This hypothesis suggests that moderate exercise has the ability to improve immune function above sedentary levels while high intensity exercise depresses the immune system [4, 10, 11] (Fig. 24.1).\n",

This includes (1) increased number of neutrophils with decreased number of lymphocytes in the blood; (2) impaired phagocytosis and neutrophil function; (3) decreased oxidative burst activity; (4) decreased natural killer cell cytolytic activity (NKCA); and (5) diminished immunoglobulin levels [8]. However, none of these functions reflect immune function as whole, and the immune system has multiple functions to protect the human body against pathogens. Therefore, measurements of blood leukocyte subtypes (e.g., Europhiles, lymphocytes) by number and function (e.g., natural killer cell activity) may not reflect the immunocompetence as a whole. Also, the host immune system is sensitive to many factors such as age, gender, nutrition state, and stress; consequently, it is difficult to predict the overall effects of small to moderate changes on immune parameters on host resistance. For this reason, the incidence of URTI is the most useful outcome from a clinical point of view [8].",

Furthermore, IL-6 cytokine showed a small yet significant increase, while cortisol levels, salivary IgA or plasma IL-1ra concentration remained unchanged. These changes are inconsistent with those reported during prolonged and intensive exertion such as large increases in leukocyte, neutrophil and monocytes counts, plasma cortisol concentration, plasma IL-6 and IL-1ra concentration, and extensive postexercise decline in IgA secretion rate, NK count and activity, and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation [14, 15]. Several findings support the stance that moderate exercise induces favorable changes in immunosurveillance [16\u201321], yet the mechanisms underlying exercise reduced URTI risk have not been fully identified [14, 22]. One study revealed that lung macrophages play an important role in mediating the beneficial effects of moderate exercise on susceptibility to respiratory infections. Specifically, mice were assigned to one of four groups: exercise and resting control with and without clodronate encapsulated liposomes (CL2MDP-lip) (a substance used to deplete tissue macrophages). The results showed that regular moderate exercise decreased morbidity by 36 %, mortality by 61 %, and symptom severity score. Davies et al., however, demonstrated in another study with mice that alveolar macrophage antiviral resistance is suppressed after exercise until fatigue, and also after 30 min of a single bout of exercise. Mice were virus inoculated after the exercise session with suppression after 30 min of exercise lasting for 3 h, and then resolved after 8 h. Increased mortality rate was only observed in mice that exercised to the point of fatigue. At first glance, these in vitro results may appear to contradict findings of Murphy et al., yet the different results could be explained by differences in immune system regulation between a single acute bout of moderate exercise and a regular moderate bout of moderate exercise performed at least 6 days before inoculation.",

            "text": "Leukocytosis (increase in leukocyte number) in peripheral blood is noticed during an exercise bout. Leukocytosis depends on exercise type, intensity, duration, and is attenuated by exercise training [4, 11]. Exercise up to 30 min leads to an increased leukocyte cell count, which then returns to baseline levels within 10\u201330 min after exercise. This period of leukocyte level returning to baseline may be longer if exercise duration is longer [1]. Researchers originally attributed this leukocytosis to hemoconcentration. Nonetheless, this theory was rejected because the fluid loss from plasma during exercise does not fully explain the large increase in peripheral blood leukocytes, which may be more than double at maximal aerobic exercise [32]. A biphasic response characterized this leukocytosis. A redistribution of leukocytes from marginal pools has been proposed to explain this sharp increase that occurs in the first phase. At least two factors have been postulated to be responsible for this redistribution: (1) the increase in cardiac output that induces a greater mechanical force that drags leukocytes from blood vessels walls; and (2) catecholamine release that might be responsible for a down regulation of leukocytes and/or endothelial cells adherence capacity [4, 11, 32]. However the second increment also called \u201cdelay leukocytosis\u201d is present only in extensive aerobic exercise (>1 h) and 2\u20134 h after a short bout of exercise. This occurs almost exclusively due to an increased number of neutrophils that are released from bone marrow [11]. This increase in neutrophils, moreover, likely is mediated by an increase in granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) rather than from epinephrine or cardiac output [1]. Previous studies in which cortisol was infused in healthy participants demonstrate that increments in cortisol plasma levels seem to be responsible for the delayed leukocytosis. Therefore, recent evidence shows that short bouts of intense exercise may cause this delay in the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow [11, 33]. Exercise intensity of less than 50 % of VO2max does not elevate plasma cortisol levels.",

Neutrophils are the predominant circulating leukocytes with importance in the nonspecific immune function by phagocyte bacteria, virus, and protozoa, which is followed by intracellular digestion mediated by granular hydrolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Moderate intensity exercise may enhance neutrophils\u2019 respiratory burst activity, mediated by increase in inflammatory cytokine IL-6 [11]. Degranulation appears to be mediated by exercise because a postexercise plasma elevation in concentrations of elastase and myeloperoxidase has been found [11]. Prolonged and acute exercise do not appear to provoke neutrophil degranulation changes during exercise, yet a great reduction of elastase release per neutrophils has been observed 2.5 h postexercise in response to bacterial stimulation. Also, intense or long duration exercise may suppress the production of reactive oxidants via elevated circulating concentrations of epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol [34]. In principle, improved responsiveness of neutrophils to stimulation following exercise of moderate intensity could mean that individuals participating in moderate exercise may have improved resistance to infection. On the other hand, competitive athletes undertaking regular intense exercise may be at greater risk of URTI. To investigate the long-term effect of endurance training (>10 years) on immunity, a study assessed phagocytic activity of circulating neutrophils at rest and after a submaximal bout of exercise in well-trained cyclists (VO2max 61.0 ml/kg/min) and sedentary age-matched controls (VO2max 37.4 ml/kg/min). Results showed that circulating neutrophil phagocytic capacity was approximately 70 % lower in trained individuals at rest compared to that of control participants. Therefore, prolonged periods of endurance training may lead to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections by diminishing immune function at rest [35]. Table 24.1 reflects the incidence of different types of exercise on neutrophil function [11, 15, 34]. Moreover, the effects of exercise on the neutrophil function have been discussed in detail by Peake [34].",

Additionally, they play an important role in mediating the acquired immune system response to an antigen presenting cell. Basically, an antigen presenting cell is responsible for displaying a fragment of the antigen that is bound to a class II MHC molecule on their membrane. Specifically, this is accomplished by either phagocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis. This way, a T cell can recognize and react to the antigen; however, T cells can only recognize antigens that have been processed and presented by cells via an MHC molecule. After a prolonged bout of intense exercise, the expression of some Toll-like receptors (TLR) on monocytes decreases. TLRs are receptors that recognize molecules, which are broadly shared by pathogen that allow antigen presenting cells to recognize pathogens [11]. The decrease of TLR 1, 2, 4 was described by Lancaster et al. [36]. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this decrease is real or merely reflects a decrease in monocytic count. A decrease in IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 production also has been associated with a reduction in TLR expression [4].",

            "text": "The mechanism underlying moderate exercise-induced decreases in URTI has not been identified completely; however, improved NKCA may play a role. NK cells are a heterogeneous subpopulation of lymphocytes that are the most responsive immune cells to acute exercise. They are part of innate immunity and their main function is to destroy virus and tumor cells. Two main NK cell subtypes have been described; that is, NK cells bright (CD56bright) and NK cells dim (CD56dim). NK cells dim are the expressed high level of CD16 and are the most cytotoxic subtype. NK cells bright express absent or low levels of CD16 resulting from high levels of cytokine production. They appear to play an important role in early immune challenge by coordinating the action between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The decision to lyse a target cell is made by these cells via a complex signal system in which activating and inhibiting signals or the Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) is involved. NK cell activating signals should dominate over inhibiting signals to lyse the target cell. If an NK cell is engaged with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 molecule, the inhibitory KIR is activated, and the presenting signal prevents NK cells from killing host cells (non-MHC restricted) [37]. In response to an aerobic or anaerobic exercise, NK cells are mobilized faster into the peripheral blood circulation. A review published by Timmons et al. in 2008 states that this mobilization is associated with improved the immune system function, which reduces the risk of virus acquisition [37]. However, a biphasic response in the NK cell function has been described after intense exercise. This NK cell cytolytic response may result from an exercise-induced imbalance in Th1/Th2 lymphocytes. Research shows that Th1 lymphocytes are suppressed after intense exercise due to corticosteroid effect. IL-2, mainly secreted by Th1 lymphocytes, is an important cytokine responsible for stimulating NKCA [11, 38, 39]. This NKCA reduction appears to make the host more susceptible to invasion by microorganisms\u2014especially to viruses [40, 41]. Moderate regular exercise has been found to increase NK cell function in both sedentary individuals and cancer patients [39, 42, 43]. A study conducted in obese women showed that 6 weeks of walking for 45 min, 5 days/week, produced a 57 % increase in NKCA compared with the 3 % increase found in the control group [44]. A marked increase in NK cell count, generally, is documented at the end of exercise, which may be due to a catecholamine-mediated demargination of cells. The opposite occurs several hours after exercise; specifically, the NK cell counts drops about 50 % compared with normal levels. In general, the normal resting value is restored in a couple of hours or within 24 h, except in prolonged intense and stressful exercise which might take longer. Also if activity is both prolonged and vigorous, the decrease in NK cell counts and NKCA may begin during the exercise session [39]. This decrease in NK cell number and cytolytic activity seems to be irrelevant for recreational participants, but becomes more important in athletes who might experience this immunosuppression several times per week.",

The new technology has revealed that high intensity exercise does not destroy NK cell. Instead, high intensity exercise is responsible for catecholamine secretion that increases the activation of adhesion molecules; therefore, NK cells are redistributed to reservoir sites such as walls of peripheral veins [4].

Meanwhile, research has shown that prolonged high intensity exercises provoke a fall in s-IgA concentration, while short and moderate exercise increases it [45\u201352]. Decreased secretion rate of s-IgA have been implicated as risk factors for subsequent episodes of URTI and URS in athletes and nonathletes [4]. The mechanism underlying exercise-induced modifications in s-IgA remain unclear. Furthermore, adrenaline seems to be partially responsible. Chronic stress, like intensive training, is associated with diminished functioning of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis (HPA), suppressed effects on IgA synthesis, and/or transcytosis (process by which various macromolecules are transported across the interior of a cell) [4].",

Also, decreases in s-IgA may occur during intensive periods of training. The main limitation in the field is that most of the studies were conducted in military populations. Military intensive training introduces a wide range of bias because this intensive training usually is accompanied with dietary energy deficiency, sleep deprivation, and psychological stress. The majority of these factors also may alter the immune response. These stressful factors appear to amplify the exercise-induced alteration.",

Lymphocytes express a high density of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors, and the density of these receptors increase due to exposure to exercise or catecholamines. The NK cells are the lymphocytes that express most of the density of these receptors followed by Lymphocytes cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) and Lymphocyte B cells (CD19+); and Lymphocyte T helper cells (CD4+) express the least amount. For that reason NK cells are more sensitive to exercise modulation, while CD4+ shows the lowest response to exercise. Lymphocytosis was observed during and immediately after an acute bout of exercise followed by decreased below resting levels during early stages of recovery. The decrease is largely observable in T lymphocytes, especially Th1 subtype, while B lymphocyte showed a lesser effect. The extent of exercise mobilization is primarily dependent on exercise intensity and duration [53]. Adrenaline seems to be responsible for this biphasic response. It is not clear as to whether the decrease is due to apoptosis or redistribution. Also, the decrease in Th1 T lymphocytes count alone does not necessarily imply reduced host immunosurveillance.",

Results showed less incidence of URTI during the 2-week postexercise period in quercetin group vs. the placebo group. Although quercetin vs. placebo ingestion did not alter exercise-induced changes in several measures of immune function, it significantly reduced URTI incidence in cyclists during the 2-week period following intensive exercise.

However, important variables such as menstrual cycle, fitness level, and use of OC were not controlled. A study performed by Timmons et al. showed that after pedalling 90 min at 65 % of VO2max females under OC treatment showed a greater increase of lymphocytes and neutrophils compared to males and females who did not use OC. No fluctuations due to menstrual cycle were experienced in females compared to non-OC users. However the response in the follicular and luteal phases seemed to affect exercise-induced changes in leukocytes. These results seem to indicate that sex hormones are not responsible for those changes. Rather, an increase in plasma levels in women under OC has been proposed to explain that [62].",

There is increasing evidence that moderate exercise might have the capability to improve immunosurveillance against URTI. More interventional research is needed to determine how this effect can be maximized [3, 14]. Future studies should make an effort to improve methodological issues such as randomization, selection of subjects, and report adverse events. Additionally, future investigations need to improve the description physical activity and/or exercise intensity and to identify the source of cells producing the high amounts of cytokine in response to a muscle contraction, which will aid in identifying their role in the repair and growth of muscle [15]. Also, it is time to examine the role of exercise on clinical outcomes in various groups including patients with immune disorder or malignant disease [15].",

Also, delayed neutrophilia mainly provoked by neutrophils, which was released from the bone marrow was observed.Exercise has a biphasic response regarding numbers of circulating lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets with an increase in the number of cells occurring during exercise as well as a decrease in cell quantity after exercise. The degree of this change is intensity and duration dependent.Evidence regarding immunonutritional supplements remains controversial. There is not enough evidence to recommend most of them.Estrogens alone are not responsible for immune sex differences in exercise-induced immune system changes. More research is needed to clarify cytokine release differences between the sexes that control variables such as menstrual cycle, OC use, fitness level, and exercise intensity.Cessation of exercise or reduction in the amount and intensity of exercise may improve the time of recovery from a URTI infection. However, athletic competition or training maintained at high intensity levels may increase the severity of the disease or even compromise the life of the athlete.",
