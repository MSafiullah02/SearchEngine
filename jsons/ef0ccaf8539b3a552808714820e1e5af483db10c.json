Partial pressure of carbon dioxide was, unfortunately, not assessed in the study. Cervicogenic headaches [a headache subtype that describes headaches arising from the neck that are precipitated by neck movement and/or sustained awkward head positioning (6, 14) ] is usually described in association with an underlying cervical pathology. It is possible that the headaches occurring in those wearing helmets, goggles and close-fitting N95 face-masks may have arisen due to pressure from the strap on the neck or back of the head over the superficial nerves, may aggravate an underlying cervical neck strain and exacerbate face-mask-associated headaches. The contribution of stress to the development of headaches is suggested by a proportion of respondents who developed tension-type headaches (n \u00bc 43, 54.4%) compared with the other headache subtypes.

Background: During the 2003 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome epidemic, healthcare workers mandatorily wore the protective N95 face-mask. Methods: We administered a survey to healthcare workers to determine risk factors associated with development of headaches (frequency, headache subtypes and duration of face-mask wear) and the impact of headaches (sick days, headache frequency and use of abortive/preventive headache medications).
