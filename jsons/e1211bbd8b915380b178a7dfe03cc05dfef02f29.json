Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method: : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results: : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health -these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions: : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.",

Not all learners have access to this kind of education, considering social inequality in many nations (UNESCO, 2020; FVG, 2020) .

Although temporary school closures as a result of health crises and other emergencies are not new, the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption are unfortunately unmatched and, if prolonged, may cause psychological pain and suffering at different levels (ABC News, 2020). When learners, parents and teachers get nervous, they make different decisions. With great fear of a strong economic deceleration caused by the coronavirus outbreak, most students and parents now claim that accessibility, the weight of doubt and, above all, the debts that usually accompany a diploma are the main concerns (CNBC, 2020).",

Colleges are being forced to consider large-scale preventive measures to keep students and professors healthy as well as to create plans for when infections materialize on campus. Educational institutions have also been dealing with the impact on exchange programs and foreign students. Colleges and universities must continue to address these and other series of profound and complex challenges in the short term. The real danger, however, may be in the long-term effects of the epidemic. Years of budget cuts and failure to meet students' basic needs make higher education especially vulnerable and potentially unequipped to handle a crisis like this (Inside Higher Ed, 2020). Current evidence shows that poor students will suffer more. About half of community college students and up to a third of four-year college and university students already face insecurity, fear, sense of loss and mood swings (The Hechinger, 2020).",

Universities must consider different approaches to deal with the coronavirus to make foreign students more comfortable.
