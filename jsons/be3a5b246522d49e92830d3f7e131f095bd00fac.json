The coactivator of estrogen receptor-mediated transcription and corepressor of other nuclear hormone receptors (transcription factors) that facilitates NR3a1 nongenomic signaling via Src and PI3K is also called proline-, glutamate-, and leucine-rich protein PELP1. The plasmalemmal NR3a signalosome comprises G-protein subunits, receptor and nonreceptor protein Tyr kinases (e.g., Src), protein Ser/Thr kinases (PKB), lipid kinases (PI3K and PDK1), and scaffold proteins (MNAR, SHC, striatin) [39] . It interacts with several growth factor signaling components (e.g., EGFR and HGF-regulated protein Tyr kinase substrate (HRS)). It interacts with androgen (AR or NR3c4) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR or NR3c1) and thus influences nuclear receptor (NR) signaling. 5 Both NR3a1 and NR3a2 can activate G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3. Plasmalemmal NR3a monomers in the absence of sex steroids rapidly homodimerize upon estrogen exposure. These dimers can then associate with G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits. Estradiol rapidly stimulates calcium entry via the TRPV6 channel [39] . 6 Regulators of calcineurin RCan1, RCan2, and RCan3 are also termed calcipressin-1 to -3 in addition to modulatory (or myocyte-enriched) calcineurin-interacting proteins MCIP1 to MCIP3. couple launches synthesis of the natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP, which hampers adverse cardiac hypertrophy via ERK kinases in the CMC. On the other hand, atherogenic 27-hydroxycholesterol serves as an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which abounds in the diseased arterial wall.

They regulate the local renin-angiotensin axis (RAA), these brain nuclei possessing renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin convertases ACE1 and ACE2, and angiotensin Agt2 receptors (e.g., AT 1 and AT 2 ). Angiotensin-2 and aldosterone stimulate ROS production in the brain by NAD(P)H oxidase, thereby raising sympathetic nerve activity. In the subfornical organ (SFO), estrogens via NR3a1 and NR3a2 prevent intracellular ROS formation.

Inflammation is indeed observed at all stages of atherogenesis, from initial lesions to fatty streaks, evolved plaques, and end-stage complications, that is, thromboembolism after unstable plaque rupture linked to an excess inflammatory episode [60] . Atherosclerosis is triggered by oxidized LDLs conveying cholesterol. Activated endotheliocytes express adhesion molecules for the diapedesis of circulating leukocytes, activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and smooth myocytes releasing cytokines and chemokines. The procoagulant cytokine increases the synthesis and secretion of fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI1 (serpin-E1), and acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), thereby amplifying the inflammatory and procoagulant response [61] . Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1, TNFSF1, and CRP) induce the formation of adhesion molecules, provoking a vicious cycle. C-reactive protein supports the production of tissue factor by monocytes and represses that of NO, hence contributing to the creation of a proinflammatory and prothrombotic milieu. Anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce cardiovascular risk [62] .",

They release histamine, tumor-necrosis factor TNFSF1, interleukins IL1\u03b2 and IL6, chemokine CXCL8, and VEGF.

Owing to this mutual excitation, IL33 potentiates SP-primed TNFSF1 production more than 100-fold in mastocytes. Mastocyte-derived tryptase can cleave extracellular IL33 into its mature active form, which then activates mastocytes, which, in turn, can release soluble IL1RL1 that modulates the effects of IL33. Substance-P also stimulates histamine secretion from mastocytes. Moreover, IL33 and SP upregulate synthesis of both TacR1 and IL1RL1 receptors. In addition, IL3 enhances SPtriggered VEGF release by mastocytes [66] . IL33 also augments the frequency and magnitude of mastocyte degranulation and chemokine production, worsening chronic inflammation, even at low concentrations. The receptors TacR1 and IL1RL1 interfere; TacR1 complexes with IL1RL1 and its coreceptor IL1RAP (IL1R accessory protein); IL33 may participate in complexing TacR1 and IL1RL1 [65] . The stem cell factor receptor (SCFR) also complexes with IL1RL1 and IL1RAP in mastocytes for cross-activation.

Protein tyrosine nitration, which consists of adding a nitro group (-NO 2 ), is mediated by RNS such as peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2212 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO \u2022 2 ). This reaction involves two steps: the oxidation of the phenolic ring of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical (Tyr \u2022 ) and the addition of NO \u2022 2 to the Tyr by a nitrating agent. Myeloperoxidase, with its transition metal center, can react with ONOO \u2212 and hence facilitate nitration [90] . Nitrotyrosine formation on enzymes, such as sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (serca2a), manganese-containing superoxide dismutase ( Mn SOD or SOD2), prostacyclin synthase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and aldolase-A, inhibits their activity. On the other hand, nitrotyrosine in fibrinogen raises its activity and accelerates clot formation.",

Higher NO amounts have a negative inotropic effect due to the blockage of sarcolemmal Ca 2+ channels and reduction in the sensitivity of troponin-C to Ca 2+ ion. Moreover, NO has a positive lusitropic effect. Phosphorylation of troponin-I reduces sarcomeric sensitivity to Ca 2+ and promotes cross-bridge detachment. Phosphorylation of titin by PKA and/or PKG also improves lusitropy. Furthermore, NO provokes vasodilation and hence reduces afterload. The chronotropic effect of NO depends on its site of action, being positive upon stimulation by cGMP of a hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker current and negative at the postsynaptic level [160] .",

Although African-Americans who are homozygous for either APOL1 variant and heterozygous are protected against African trypanosomiasis (or sleeping sickness), they are at an increased risk for renal disease.

Therefore, the EPHb4-Ras-ERK pathway is a major axis for AVMs. Ephrin binds to the erythropoietin-producing hepatocyte (EPH) receptors on the surface of the apposed cell and triggers EPH aggregation, fostering EPH transphosphorylation (transactivation). Polymerization of the receptor is first carried out by assembling monomers (6-8) into active oligomers (activation phase) that then condensate into large clusters (hundreds of monomers), which dampens signaling (inactivation phase), thereby creating a fast and transient response [196] .
