FCoV has been classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein [1, 2]. Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats, whereas FIPV infection causes lethal disease: FIP [3]. FIPV (virulent FCoV) has been proposed to arise from FECV (avirulent FCoV) due to a mutation [4\u20136]; however, the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified.",

However, large amount of serum and plasma are needed for developing ICA test. It is practically difficult to obtain large amounts of serum and plasma from FCoV-infected cats. Therefore, we recommend using anti-FCoV mAb instead of cat anti-FCoV IgG.The Hybridoma producing mAb YN-2 was prepared following the method reported by Hohdatsu et al. [1]. In our experience, the mAb YN-2 has a higher affinity for the colloidal gold-labeled rNP than other anti-FCoV N mAb (e.g., mAb E22-2).Glutathione sepharose beads are just added to PBS and then they are ready to use.GST-tagged rNP was eluted from the beads by drip-through at a constant flow (2.0\u20133.0 ml/min).Generally, reagents are dispensed by the dispensing machine on a nitrocellulose membrane. However, this machine is very expensive. If you intend to develop an ICA kit on a trial basis, we recommend using a fine-point brush instead of the machine.The specific detection of anti-FCoV antibodies was possible in all heparin-anticoagulated plasma, serum, whole blood, and ascitic fluid samples from anti-FCoV positive cats. On the other hand, the nonspecific test line formation was noted in EDTA- or sodium citrate-anticoagulated plasma of anti-FCoV negative cats.\n",
