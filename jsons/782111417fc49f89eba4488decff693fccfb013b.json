In this regard, neurological disorders contribute to 11,6% of global DALYs and 16,5% of deaths from all causes, remaining the leading group cause of DALYs and the second leading group cause of deaths in the world [7] . Preparedness to continue to guarantee treatment to neurological patients is vital in containing and mitigating the collateral effects of COVID-19, which, based on current knowledge, does not seem to be a neurotropic virus and is reported to cause limited neurologic involvements [8] . Baracchini et al., in this brief report published in this current issue, are sharing how the University Hospital of Padua, with a catchment area of about 950.000 people, structured a pathway for acute stroke patients before admitting them to our Stroke Unit [9] . Since the outbreak of the COVID epidemic, a dedicated stroke triage protocol has been activated. The stroke patient who is already known to be COVID-19 positive undergoes Cerebral CT, CTA, and CTP on a high-performance mobile CT outside the Emergency Department. In the case of ischemic stroke without large vessel occlusion, the patient is transferred to the Infectious Disease Department or a dedicated Medical Department after thrombolysis treatment and will be continued to be clinically monitored by the stroke team and by the internist. In case of large vessel occlusion, the patient is admitted to the Angio-suite of the Neuroradiology Unit for endovascular treatment, and the personnel is pre-alerted for adopting adequate PPEs. At the end of the procedure, the patient is transferred to the Infectious Disease ward or a dedicated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dedicated to COVID-19 patients based on neurological conditions. When the patient is admitted with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection because of current fever or recent fever and/or flu-like syndrome, nasopharyngeal swabs are taken from the nasopharynx and each nostril. In the meanwhile, the patient undergoes Cerebral CT, CTA, and CTP on the mobile CT unit. Patients deemed eligible for intravenous thrombolysis follow the standard protocol. If there is no indication for thrombectomy, the patient waits for the result of the COVID-19 screening in a dedicated area, where the stroke team clinically monitors him. Only if the COVID-19 screening is negative, the patient is transferred to the Stroke Unit; whereas the COVID-19 positive patients will be transferred to a dedicated COVID-19 medical ward. In case of large vessel occlusion, the patient is transferred to the Angio suite of the Neuroradiology Unit for endovascular treatment, and the personnel is pre-alerted as for COVID positive. If the COVID-19 screen is negative, the patient is transferred to the Stroke Unit or the Neuro-ICU based on their neurological conditions. In all cases, the stroke team is responsible for the stroke care of the patient.",
