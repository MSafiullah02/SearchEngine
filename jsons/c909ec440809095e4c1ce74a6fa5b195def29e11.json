Previous studies have established a clear link between pandemic and symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and suicidal tendencies. [10] [11] [12] According to the behavioral immune system (BIS) theory, personal reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, include the development of self-protection mechanisms, such as fear, negative emotions, and negative cognitive evaluation. 13 In addition to the fear and anxiety caused by the virus itself, several other factors may negatively impact the mental health of people under lock-down. 14, 15 The internet has become an essential and inseparable part of the modern lifestyle. 16 However, there is a \"problematic behavior of human interactions with information and communication technologies\" that has led to the development of concerning long-term issues. 17 The term \"internet addiction,\" which is defined as \"a psychological dependence on the internet, regardless of the type of activity once logged on,\" describes this problematic behavior. 18 Several studies have found that internet addiction increases the risk of depression, anxiety and stress. [16] [17] [18] [19] Due to the sudden onset of COVID-19, few studies have explored the effects of SARS-COV-2 on mental health. 14, 20, 21 To our knowledge there are no studies in Latin American countries that have explored how this pandemic may increase internet addiction, .

Overuse of internet to obtain information about COVID-19 may exacerbate stress responses, increase levels of anxiety and depression, amplify concern, and impair functioning. This can lead to additional media consumption and further distress, creating a cycle that can be difficult to break. 37 According to our results internet abuse was also associated to sleep problems and younger age. Roy et al, 20 found that, in Indian population, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related to social media use were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants, respectively. The negative impact of internet abuse on both sleep duration and sleep quality has been previously described in the literature. 38 For example, Kim et al 39 found that Korean subjects with internet addiction were 1.7 times more likely to experience poor sleep quality in comparison to those with normal internet use. Also, subjects who spent more time in the web have more (2.5 times higher) risk of developing depressive symptoms. Our results are also consistent with previous reports that the younger generations trend to be heavier internet users and are more exposed to social media exposition than older people. 40 The reasons are multiple but mainly involve technical skills and availability of internet resources.",

The lack of social interaction has caused an increase in mental health problems as well. Panic, stress, anxiety, depression, boredom, anger, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances have also been reported as a consequence of social isolation. 42, 43 In addition, staying home for long periods of time can lead to receiving less sunlight, which could decrease serotonin levels. This has been associated with emotional disorders like anxiety but mainly depression. 44 As in other studies, we found that women were more likely to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to men. 36 This finding corresponds with extensive epidemiological studies which have found that women are, in general, at higher risk of developing depression. 45 \"Metaworry\", the persistent worry about one's own thoughts and cognitive processes, is more frequent in women than in men. Thus, it is possible that fear to COVID-19 triggers a negative metacognitive process in which one worries about one's own worrying which could potentially cause harm to oneself. 46 It is important to acknowledge that our study has several limitations. As in other studies performed during this period, we adopted the snowball sampling strategy, thus our population is biased and may not reflect the actual pattern of general population. In an ideal scenario we should conduct a prospective evaluation of the same group of participants a period after the pandemic. We acknowledge that additional longitudinal studies, such as cohort studies or nested case-control studies are essential in the future. However, we decided to compare anxiety and depression with an historic cohort, and although this control group is not exactly matched to our studied population, the prevalence of anxiety .

One hundred and forty-two subjects (25.3%, 95% CI 21.6% to 28.9%) have overlapping anxiety and depression symptoms.",
