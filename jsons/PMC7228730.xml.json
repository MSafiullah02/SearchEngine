Such expectations are projected in different paths and include inexpensive rapid tests for genetic predisposition, viral infection and the first signs of diseases long before symptoms manifest themselves [6]. Biomarkers are very important as they allow early diagnosis and intervention prior to the occurrence of potentially serious clinical events. They can be used to establish the prognosis of patient and help to plan the treatment. In addition they can provide early information about the efficacy of treatment and indicate whether to continue, switch or stop the therapy [7,8]. For example, in the field of oncology, when tumor cells die, they release circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) into the blood. Scientists recourse to liquid biopsy to detect and purify ctDNA, thus, the purified biomaterial is analyzed using advanced and complex technique in the field of genomics such as digital PCR, next generation sequencing (NGS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and BEAMing [9,10]. However, these techniques require an operation by specialized personnel in large infrastructures such as hospitals or research centres. Currently, most of the reported results are performed in optimal laboratory settings as a proof-of-concept for specific biomarkers, instead of using complex environment (e.g., whole blood, urine, cells), where the mixture of biomolecules and ions often provoke false signals and reduced the sensitivity [11]. Extensive studies have proven that plasmonic nanoparticles (especially gold) exhibit properties that facilitate their implementation in molecular assays for the detection of genetic mutations in biological samples. However the response of those systems, relies exclusively on the color change of the sample [12,13].",

Nowadays, magnetophoresis is being used in a wide range of research and technological areas ranging from environment remediation to biomedical applications [14,15]. Numerous applications, encompassing wastewater treatments [[16], [17], [18]], pollutant removal [19], biomolecules isolation, drug delivery, and magnetic-particle imaging [[20], [21], [22]], have been developed. Within biomedical applications, magnetic separation enables the separation and isolation of targeted biological materials such as proteins, cells, small biomolecules from complex mixtures, by the use of superparamagnetic colloids. Generally, these superparamagnetic colloids present a spherical shape with sizes ranging from a few tens of nanometers to microns. These nanostructures, are commonly made by embedding superparamagnetic nanocrystals in a non-magnetic matrix such as polystyrene or nanoporous silica [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. Other nanostructures consist of magnetic nanoparticles coated with inorganic materials such as Au, Ag or silica, resulting in core/shell nanostructures [27,28]. Prior to their use as magnetic carriers, the surfaces of these nanostructures are modified, so that they bind to the targeted biological material in a solution to produce magnetic biological composites. In the particular case of genetic and pathogenic disease detection, the surface of the particles can be modified by grafting complementary oligonucleotides. Thus, a magnetic field is applied to the sample (commonly a complex colloidal mixture) to drive the magnetic biological complex towards selected regions of the containing vessel, enabling the separation of the solid content from the liquid mixture, and thus the removal of the liquid phase [[29], [30], [31]].",

Particularly, this report addresses a new and sensitive UV\u2013vis spectroscopy assisted-magnetophoresis method for the monitoring of the hybridization process of twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides (hereafter TB1 and TB2). For this purpose, two batches of magnetic particles are separately functionalized with TB1 and TB2. When the magnetic particles from two different batches are mixed and incubated, colloidal aggregates composed of the magnetic particles, TB1, and TB2 are formed as a result of the hybridization process. The aggregates, when brought under a uniform magnetic field gradient, move at a different velocity than the initial non-functionalized magnetic particles. The velocity of the formed agglomerates depends on their resulting magnetic strength, which is quantified with the parameter \u0393. This behavior induces an important difference in the magnetic separation time of the formed aggregates, which is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the colloidal suspension at specific wavelengths. The method is highly sensitive as it allows the detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001% w/v. Moreover, the aggregates concentrate in the region where the magnetic field is maximum (on the walls of the recipient containing the suspension), allowing their collection for further analyses.",

The system consists of a cubical cavity containing a permanent magnetic field with a uniform radial gradient pointing toward the walls of the cubical non-magnetic-support, as shown in Fig. 1\n. The magnetic force within the magnetic device is generated by a set of permanent magnets placed in a ring-like distribution following the Halbach progression for a quadrupole [34]. The magnetic device is placed inside the spectrophotometer, and subsequently, a standard polystyrene cuvette containing the MPs suspension (the sample) is introduced into the device in the position as illustrated in Fig. 1\u20131. An empty cuvette is used as a reference. Pictures showing the experimental setup are presented in figure S1 of Supporting Information. The assembly generates a constant gradient in the sample volume (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). The magnetic device presents symmetric apertures for the entrance and exit of the beam light. The light is transmitted in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic force direction. The design of the device allows the insertion of the sample (cuvette) in the working area where the magnetic field is higher than the saturation magnetic field, and thus the MPs become saturated.",

The wavelengths 350 nm, 580 nm, and 750 nm were selected to collect the magnetophoresis data. Fig. 2-c shows the obtained magnetophoresis curves of the suspension. The curves show a similar behavior consisting of a progressive increase of the suspension transmittance. The transmittance increases by 50% respect to the initial state at a time t50 of 255.04 \u00b1 2.67 s at 350 nm, 239.44 \u00b1 0.86 s at 580 nm, and 236.86 \u00b1 0.98 s at 750 nm. The time t50 is slightly larger when the data are collected at 350 nm wavelength, which is likely due to the strong absorbance of iron at this wavelength range [35,36].

When MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2 suspensions (0.001%) are mixed in a ratio 1:1, and as shown in Fig. 4\n-a, 60 min of incubation time is the threshold for the hydrogen bonding to occur between the bases A\u2013T (Adenine-Thymine) and C\u2013G (Cytosine-Guanine), overcoming the electrosteric repulsion. This hybridization results in the formation of agglomerates, as schematically illustrated in Figs. 4-c and 4-d. When the suspension is brought under the magnetic force, the agglomerates move faster toward the walls of the container, following a cooperative magnetophoretic mode [[37], [38], [39]]. The velocity of separation of MPs-TB1/MPs-TB2 suspension is higher than the velocity of MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2, showing differences \u0394t1 ranging from \u223c37 s to \u223c113 s, depending on the incubation time.",

However, the emphasis of our discussion will be on FeAu-TB1 composites (the results are the same for FeAu-TB2). To confirm the successful functionalization of the FeAu-NPs, the changes in the SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) peak were used. For this purpose, UV\u2013vis spectra of FeAu-TB1 suspension were collected, and the kinetics of the intensity of the SPR peak were monitored during time. The obtained spectra of FeAu-TB1 suspensions are illustrated in figure S3 of Supporting Information. The spectra show a progressive decay of the intensity of the SPR peak around 530 nm indicating the decrease in the concentration of pristine FeAu-NPs in buffer suspension, which suggests the formation of chemical bonds between the FeAu-NPs and the TB1 oligonucleotide. On the other hand, the additional decrease of SPR peak intensity after reacting the functionalized FeAu-TB1 NPs with TB2 (as illustrated in figure S3) further confirms the successful functionalization of the NPs, in agreement with previous reports [41,42].",

Fig. 5-b illustrates the normalized UV\u2013vis spectra of the mixture of both suspensions for different times of incubation. For the preparation of the mixture, 20 \u03bcL of MPs-TB2 suspension was mixed with 80 \u03bcL the suspension of FeAu-TB1. This proportions result in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL containing 0.002% w/v of MPs-TB2 particles and 0.016% w/v of FeAu-TB1 NPs (ratio \u223c 1:8). Three samples of the mixture were prepared and incubated for different times. The resulting UV\u2013vis spectra show a red shift of the SPR peaks of \u223c15 nm and \u223c32 nm when incubation times are increased to 3 h and 20 h, respectively (Fig. 5-b). A plausible explanation of the observed red shifts, is the spatial proximity between FeAu-TB1 NPs at the occurrence of the hybridization process on the surface of MPs-TB2 particles, as illustrated in the inset in Fig. 5b, providing an efficient optical platform for a strong near-field plasmonic coupling between the FeAu-NPs [3,42]. The position of the SPR peak corresponding to the sample after 1 h of incubation time doesn\u2019t show any shift with respect to the UV\u2013vis spectrum of FeAu-TB1 (Fig. 5-a), which might be a result of the short incubation time. This is in full agreement with our previous discussion in section 3.2.1., where we pointed-out the nature\u2019s role of the different interactions between the functionalized MPs. At the beginning, a balance between the repulsive interactions between FeAu-TB1 NPs and the attractive interactions between FeAu-TB1 and MPs-TB2 would take place, resulting in a small number of FeAu-TB1 NPs attached to the surface of each MP-TB2. After one hour of incubation time, a new balance between the different interactions would be established; the hydrogen bonding between the bases A\u2013T and C\u2013G is likely to become dominant, resulting in an increased number of FeAu-TB1 NPs attached to the surface of each MP-TB2. The spatial proximity of the FeAu-NPs resulting from the increasing number of FeAu-TB1 anchored to the surface of a MP-TB2 leads to a strong near-field plasmonic coupling between the FeAu-NPs, which justifies the SPR peak shift to higher wavelengths, as can be observed in Fig. 5-b [3,42].",

For example, assuming that each FeAu-TB1 NPs is anchored to the surface of the MP-TB2 via a specific number of hybridizations (or points), the number of the anchored FeAu-NPs can be directly associated to the number of the oligonucleotides. Which is highly promising for a quantitative and rapid molecular diagnostic test. Thereby, more quantitative studies combined with theoretical simulations are needed to further advance these findings.",

The method consists of a simultaneous optical and magnetophoretic monitoring of the colloidal suspensions containing the biomolecule to be detected and isolated. For this purpose:i)A magnetic device generating a uniform magnetic field gradient of 7.5 T/m was designed and incorporated into a commercial spectrophotometer.ii)MPs composed of Fe NPs embedded in PS matrix, and magnetoplasmonic NPs composed of Fe core and Au shell, were successfully functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides (named TB1 and TB2).iii)The study demonstrates that incubation time plays an important role in TB1-TB2 hybridization process, and shows that, for concentrations of 0.001% (w/v), 60 min of incubation is the threshold for the hybridization process to occur.iv)Hybridization process results in the formation of agglomerates composed of the magnetic particles and the biomolecules. When brought under the 7.5 T/m magnetic field gradient, those agglomerates follow a cooperative magnetophoretic separation, and move faster than non-hybridized composites.v)The agglomerates composed of hybridized MPs-TB2/FeAu-TB1 separate either faster or slower than the non-hybridized colloids, depending the number of FeAu-NPs bound to each MP.vi)By the use of magnetoplasmonic NPs, the intensity and the shift of the SPR peak are used to track the surface functionalization of the FeAu-NPs, and the formation of the aggregates in the suspension, respectively.\n",

This method is promising for the improvement of conventional latex agglutination tests, used to detect a wide range of analytes in clinical laboratories [33,44]. In addition, the possibility of recovering the agglomerates at the walls of the container allows their further analysis. In the specific case of agglomerates containing plasmonic nanoparticles, further optical analysis of the sample, such as Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), can be conducted allowing the detection of biomolecules, such as proteins and antigens, at a very low concentrations [3,45]. This method represents a big step towards a powerful quantitative tool for rapid molecular diagnosis of diseases, and thus contributes to the prevention of societies and economic-systems collapsing, as witnessed with the current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).",
