While emergent responses are common in the aftermath of a crisis, COVID-19 presents unique challenges in that the crisis is still unfolding, with no clear end in sight.

We share a detailed case study of one of the earliest such responses, a \"virtual idea blitz.\" 2 This rapid-response initiative was led by a group of management and entrepreneurship faculty from Indiana University's Kelley School of Business. The team conceptualized and delivered the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz, a three-day event that involved more than 200 individuals from five continents, 10 countries, and many U.S. states. The case study details these efforts, in which, over the course of only 7 days, the faculty group coalesced around the idea of rapidly applying the best entrepreneurial tools and thinking to generate a communal, high-impact response to COVID-19. Integrating principles and methodologies from design sprints (Knapp, Zeratsky, & Kowitz, 2016) , startup weekends (Nager, Nelsen, & Nouyrigat, 2011) and hackathons (Briscoe & Mulligan, 2014; Komssi, Pichlis, Raatikainen, Kindstr\u00f6m, & J\u00e4rvinen, 2014; Trainer, Kalyanasundaram, Chaihirunkarn, & Herbsleb, 2016) , this rapid, collective response to COVID-19 was among the first of scores of similar events that later emerged in response to this societal grand challenge.",

Extreme cases \"often reveal more information because they activate more actors and more basic mechanisms in the situation studied\" (Flyvbjerg, 2006, p. 229) . The organizing team, composed of a small group of faculty, initiated this project in hope of alleviating suffering and having a positive social impact-goals consistent with research on compassionate postcrisis organizing (Dutton, Worline, Frost, & Lilius, 2006; Williams & Shepherd, 2018) and social entrepreneurship in the face of grand challenges (Bacq & Aguilera, 2019) . The team drew upon existing resources (e.g., expertise, social networks) to bring a novel program to market for a set of stakeholders who were not perfectly definable at the outset of the project. These efforts are representative of entrepreneurial hustle: urgent, unorthodox actions that are intended to be useful in addressing immediate challenges and opportunities under conditions of uncertainty (Fisher, Stevenson, Burnell, Neubert, & Kuratko, 2020) . Exploring in real time the efforts to launch the virtual idea blitz, this study seeks to answer two questions: (1) What organizing principles enabled the Kelley School faculty to respond so rapidly to the unprecedented crisis, and (2) how might this approach be replicated in addressing the ongoing challenges imposed by COVID-19, as well as other societal grand challenges?",

We provide a chronological overview to shed light on the organizing principles and idiosyncratic features that enabled the Kelley School's faculty to respond to the emerging crisis in a timely and effective manner. Second, we provide evidence of value creation both for participants and for the targets of the social initiatives that emerged from the virtual idea blitz; these outcomes included a successful digital innovation, virtual community building anchored in a strong sense of collective purpose, and the rapid prototyping, deployment, and operation several ventures. Third, we provide details of the event in hope of spurring other organizing groups, whether academic, community, or professional, to take similar action to address this multifaceted crisis or other current societal grand challenges by coalescing entrepreneurial communities. Finally, we discuss practical implications of the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz.",

Chronological overview of an emergent response to an unprecedented challenge In March 2020, the world was grinding to a halt as a new virus, for which there was no known cure, was spreading rapidly. Though, at that point in time, total fatalities were only approaching 100 in the U.S., the pandemic had killed at least 3,000 in China-according to Chinese Government reports-and was killing hundreds per day in Italy. It was becoming increasingly likely that many European countries and the U.S. were only days or weeks behind other countries in experiencing a similar exponential infection rate. Thus, the COVID-19 crisis had quickly become an unprecedented grand challenge that created many social, health, and economic problems on a global scale (Gates, 2020) . These problems overwhelmed existing healthcare and governmental organizations, which elicited the need for independent social entrepreneurial ventures-organizing efforts centered on opportunities to create social value (Bacq & Janssen, 2011) -to participate in a large-scale response.",

The organizing team's assumption was that, at a minimum, the local student community would desire to respond to the many challenges caused by the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and that students would therefore be willing to assist, perhaps by applying skills such as coding, website creation, design, and social media marketing.

A standard design sprint is traditionally conducted over a period of 5 days in an effort to minimize the time required to solve critical business questions and to validate and then implement an idea. Design sprints are traditionally held in person, as they require extensive, uninterrupted collaboration between a team, usually of seven to eight handpicked individuals who bring different skill sets to bear. The five-phase design-sprint process draws upon principles of business strategy, innovation, and consumer behavior, with an overarching goal of solving big issues quickly so as to avoid idea churn and reduce risks when bringing a new product, service, or feature to the market. Sprints have successfully been applied by organizations including LEGO, Lufthansa, Slack, the United Nations, Prudential Financial, the British Museum, and the Australian social enterprise Thankyou, among others. Importantly, previous efforts had demonstrated that the design-sprint process is highly malleable; for instance, others have previously adjusted the timeline from a 5day process to a 3-day process. One of the organizing members teaches this process to Kelley MBA students in the course of a 7-week class.",

In terms of providing instructional and best-practice content, the faculty decided to focus on simplicity and, given the difficulty of maintaining participants' engagement remotely, to restrict all workshops to a 1-hour time limit. While this restriction limited the ability to build shared practices and understanding among participants, it was important to maximize the workshopping time available to the teams. To overcome the lack of colocation, the organizers introduced customized tools using existing platforms (e.g., Google Slides, Google Sheets) so that teams could replace physical documents and the face-to-face collaboration available during more traditional design-sprint settings. These online extensions of design-sprint methodologies were developed nearly in real time as the management and entrepreneurship faculty sought to provide a loose structure that would offer helpful guidelines while not overly restricting teams already managing extreme organizational constraints.",

That is, the objective was to facilitate the emergence of independent teams capable of developing ideas into prototypes that could be implemented to make a significant social impact. Indeed, this was the primary driver behind the decisions to help cultivate a systematic idea-development process and to provide independent teams with opportunities to present their ideas and prototypes to those with the resources to financially back their initiatives. We realized early on that we had neither the capacity nor the desire to manage individual ventures; our skill sets were positioned to serve as accelerants to the diverse and novel skill sets of the volunteer teams. For these reasons, we did not specifically quantify the social impacts of each venture, but we have taken several steps to document and evaluate the outcomes of the virtual idea blitz as a whole.",

            "text": "First, we have tracked the outcomes of teams that remained active following the conclusion of the virtual idea blitz. For instance, one of the participating teams, #RealHereosNeedMasks, has partnered with celebrities, athletes, and key influencers from around the globe to launch a social media campaign to raise awareness about shortages of personal protective equipment and to mobilize public action to get that equipment into the hands of those who need it most: frontline healthcare professionals, who are the real heroes. In a span of three weeks following the event, team #RealHeroesNeedMasks facilitated the donation of over 21,000 masks (see Appendix C). Similarly, another team, ReScaleMed, 5 has partnered with volunteer critical-care specialists, doctors, and medical-device technologists to increase the number of medical personnel available to set up ventilators and manage intubated patients. They are currently curating key medical training content to help quickly scale up frontline medical resources worldwide. Still other teams are seeking to scale up their efforts, while some teams' ideas have been terminated. 6 Second, we have also collected evidence that the participating teams were chasing the right problems and generating ideas that will continue to be used by us and others. For example, Dyson has designed a new ventilator and is planning to build 15,000 of them; GE Healthcare in Madison, Wisconsin is on a hiring surge for more ventilator assemblers (Merrick & Noon, 2020) ; New York is allowing multiple patients per ventilator (Siegel, 2020) ; Apple has provided support for teachers moving to virtual teaching (Dormehl, 2020) ; steps have been taken to help the elderly; and interventions have addressed the increased risk of domestic abuse during the crisis (Graham-Harrison, Giuffrida, Smith, & Ford, 2020) . In sum, many of the initiatives being pursued through private-public partnerships seek to address the core challenges we raised in our virtual idea blitz, suggesting that the teams were coalescing around some of the most pressing issues related to COVID-19. While the most important priorities will-and should-evolve with changing needs as the crisis unfolds (Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, & Zhao, 2017; Williams & Shepherd, 2018) , we remain confident that the virtual idea blitz was an effective organizing mechanism for identifying and mitigating the most relevant challenges in the moment.",

We found that the event has been replicated by some initial participants and by other actors, though we expect some of these were developed independently, without knowledge of this particular virtual idea blitz 7 . Yet several higher education institutions, including the University of Cambridge, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, and Valdosta State University have reached out to the organizing team seeking guidance on how to organize a similar event. Similarly, incubators and accelerators such as Gener8tor and 5 http://www.rescalemed.org/ 6 While not all ideas were ultimately taken to market (and some are still in the process of seeking backing), we still view the event as a major success. One of the key objectives of design sprints is to vet ideas rapidly to avoid wasting resources on those that will not work. That is, it is better to learn (in a short time) that an idea is infeasible than to spend significant resources on one that should not be pursued. Therefore, terminated ideas are still successes in that they prevent the waste of critical, limited resources (see Knapp et al., 2016) . 7 For example, Techstars Startup Weekend-with whom we communicated at the launch of our events-has launched a series of virtual events for the first time; for a list, see https://startupweekend.org/interests/covid-19",

Virtual idea blitzes as a tool for rapidly stimulating innovation As described above, virtual idea blitzes integrate aspects of design sprints, startup weekends, and hackathons. We anticipate that the virtual idea blitz will continue to be employed in a variety of contexts. For example, one result of COVID-19 is the mass migration of traditional, in-person courses to an online format. We anticipate that the concepts developed here could be applied in this new context. Indeed, one member of the organizing team is doing this right now: teaching an online version of a design sprint to in-residence MBAs at the Kelley School of Business. In addition, faculty could replicate and adapt this concept as a capstone of an online course on entrepreneurship, innovation, or design. Finally, we anticipate a wide range of applications in which traditional innovation collaborations are no longer available (e.g., in-person hackathons, startup weekends). Given its goal to move from idea to minimum viable product (MVP) as rapidly as possible, the virtual idea blitz can aid in innovation efforts in education, industry, and beyond.",

            "text": "Delivering this event required the organizers to act under conditions of uncertainty and under resource constraints in order to bring a novel program to market for a set of stakeholders who were not perfectly identifiable at the outset. This type of action under uncertainty has recently been presented in the literature as \"entrepreneurial hustle\" (Fisher et al., 2020) . Fisher and colleagues (2020) define entrepreneurial hustle as an entrepreneur's urgent, unorthodox actions that are intended to be useful in addressing immediate challenges and opportunities under conditions of uncertainty. Their study indicates that such behaviors are quite common in startup organizations and are necessary but not sufficient foundational behaviors for entrepreneurial success. Similarly, prior leadership research has identified that undertaking unorthodox actions to address emergent challenges may be appropriate in extreme conditions or crisis responses (Hannah, Uhl-Bien, Avolio, & Cavarretta, 2009; Reid, Anglin, Baur, Short, & Buckley, 2018) . In the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz, entrepreneurial hustling was evident in both the organizing and executional aspects of the planning team and also within each of the idea teams. Inherent to such behaviors is rapid decision making. Our findings suggest several practical questions organizations should consider: How do we encourage entrepreneurial hustle in times of crisis rather than forcing things from the top down? How might we enable people within our organization to build on their unique strengths rather than requiring they follow a playbook provided by corporate officers? And how can entrepreneurs communicate their ability to hustle in responding to emergent customer needs and market opportunities?",

As detailed in this article, our virtual idea blitz was conceived on a Monday, and the program commenced just 4 days later. Against the challenging backdrop of a global pandemic, the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz was able to draw on the prosocial motives of participants from disparate groups with complementary skills. The core motivation of all participants was to develop an idea to help resolve a social issue related to COVID-19. Despite the short recruitment window of 48 hours, we successfully gathered multiple audiences across academic, student, professional, and funder groups. The lockdowns and stay-at-home orders created for some participants the flexibility to dedicate a short, concentrated burst of time that would ordinarily not have been available. They also eliminated the prospect of meeting in person and allowed for a collective embracing of a shared virtual mindset that may not have been possible if the event had been organized under previous conditions. These extraordinary circumstances proved a strength for our event.",

A sample of the portfolio of innovative programs presently offered include: the Clapp IDEA Competition-a campus-wide idea competition that solicits novel ideas from across the campus; the \"spine sweat\" course-a semester-long effort to develop promising ventures that concludes with pitches to venture capitalists in Silicon Valley; and several other notable cocurricular entrepreneurship programs. Further, several faculty in the department help run a residential week-long program called Kelley Connect Week for its online MBA program, Kelley Direct. Kelley Direct has a long tenure of innovative online delivery and is ranked as the best online MBA program in the world (U.S. News & World Report, 2020).

First, while we cite the relatively speedy reaction by the organizing team as a strength, more time would have allowed for more effective coordination of coaches, mentors, and seminar leads. Second, the online portal allowed anyone to sign up with minimal barriers. As a result, many of the idea submitters were not screened carefully for their understanding of or commitment to the multiday event, nor for their ability to contribute meaningfully to an entrepreneurial team. Because registration was left open and the time window was short, teams were formed on the basis of interest and not with a view to the functional backgrounds of team members. Therefore, a registration cutoff and more time would allow organizers to assign teams more effectively. Some similar events incorporate a competitive element, including announcing winners and providing prizes or funding at the conclusion of the event. This could provide teams with legitimacy as they pursue their ideas further. The organizing team, however, decided not to employ a competitive design, both because of the collective desire to see social solutions emerge and to avoid disappointing participants who did not win. This was a difficult decision, as the organizing team also recognized the potential benefits to team members' motivation and commitment were a competitive element involved. Future organizers should particularly consider these trade-offs if implementing a virtual idea blitz, particularly in other contexts where there may be less interest.",

Future events may benefit from a more deliberate process of evaluating and assessing the leadership capabilities of the group prior to assigning idea leads.

The first step was taken by the champion, who initiated the idea and then gathered a set of like-minded advocates who became the organizing team. Together, the champion and the organizing team energized different stakeholder groups to bring them aboard the project.

The organizing team sought to balance these two goals by abductively identifying key themes from the submissions and systematically generating an organizing framework; this is consistent with best practices in qualitative research methods (Corbin & Strauss, 2015) . Ultimately, the organizing team selected five overarching idea themes to organize the 95 submitted ideas or pain points, and it selected 11 general ideas that fit into these themes. For each idea, one to three idea leads-that is, the individuals who had submitted pertinent ideaswere identified and notified that they had been given the opportunity to share their ideas with working teams.

Specifically, the organizing team designed the overall process of the virtual idea blitz to align with synchronized clock time (Saunders, Van Slyke, & Vogel, 2004) , which provided structure and time pressure to help motivate teams to achieve certain steps as the event proceeded. Most teams had two academic mentors and two industry or professional mentors; these consisted of volunteers who wished to add their expertise to the weekend and were primarily angel investors, venture capitalists, or individuals with experience in accelerators.",

The organizing team featured several items during the celebration, including a website with all teams' video pitches edited to include intro and outro slides with music; a highlight reel recapping the weekend that included brief clips from several of the teams' pitches; and recognition of individuals who were not part of the organizing team but who played important supporting roles over the course of the weekend. After the event, the organizers decided to publicize the teams' ideas and prototypes for two reasons. First, publicity can attract new team members or critical support (e.g., technical skills) to the teams that elected to implement their prototypes, which could help them execute their ideas more rapidly or at greater scale. Second, it can also help attract funding. The focus on disseminating ideas that could create social value was a key distinction compared to events that prioritize commercialization and protection of intellectual property. Appendix F provides details and screenshots of these publication efforts.",

While we hope pandemic threats will receive greater attention, better scenario planning, and more rapid mitigation going forward, this article is intended to help entrepreneurship, management, and business scholars and practitioners to collectively consider how we can draw on our research expertise to stimulate community responses to a variety of acute and chronic societal grand challenges facing our world (George et al., 2016) . Our experience suggests that universities can play a valuable role in linking professionals, students, and researchers in shared endeavors that can achieve substantial societal benefits. This article describes how such efforts can be rapidly mobilized and can lead to high-impact results. In recounting this experience, describing the integrative and community-building approach, and providing a detailed description of specific actions and tools, we hope to encourage and inspire other organizers, to provide them with a guide to accelerate their efforts, and to point out shortcomings they might avoid. As we write this, we remain unsure of the final health consequences and economic losses that will result from COVID-19. But we hope that other organizers, including professors, professionals, and students, can use this article to stimulate their own progress in tackling the evolving challenges posed by this pandemic and the many other societal grand challenges they are sure to confront.",

Essentially what I've come up with is facilitating a rapid entrepreneurship accelerator and matchmaking program that brings together students faculty and alums to generate ideas and build solutions related to issues that have arisen due to COVID-19 (could include tech applications, social distancing products/service, remote working, repurposing of facilities/resources-see link below). Think of it like a digital startup weekend focused on entirely on COVID-19 solutions of all types (note: this was later renamed a \"Virtual Idea Blitz\").I have sketched this as a landing page/place to save ideas-still fine tuning (see here). This program would draw on our entrepreneurial toolkit and workshop strengths. The goal would be to move ideas into the prototype stage rapidly.I've vetted the concept with some student entrepreneurs who have tech/coding skills and they have interest in participating. In general they believe other students would rally to assist in any way they can (e.g., design, web, social media marketing, etc.). I also have some initial interest from groups and individuals that would want to fund/support viable solutions that may come out of this initiative. Beyond that, I think that our alumni and community would quickly rally to support any viable initiatives that emerge.Please share thoughts/concerns via email if you have any. If this is something you want to participate in please let me know if you can jump on a zoom call at 10:00 am tomorrow to discuss/vet/adapt this concept. \u2022 When instructed, participants and mentors accept the breakout room of the team number they have been assigned.",
