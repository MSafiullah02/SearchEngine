Since the widespread availability of the hepatitis B vaccine with worldwide implementation of vaccination programs, one would expect a concomitant decrease in HDV alongside HBV. However, the prevalence of HDV appears to be rising and may be attributed to the higher prevalence of HDV infection in individuals with HIV co-infection and intravenous drug users.3\n,\n4 The global burden of disease is estimated to be 62 to 72 million, affecting nearly 1% of the general population.4\n",

Superinfection occurs when an individual with established chronic hepatitis B infection (defined by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen) is exposed to an acute hepatitis D infection. Whereas superinfection with HDV is more likely to develop into chronic infection, 95% of individuals with HBV-HDV coinfection ultimately have viral clearance.5 Chronic HDV infection is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis with greater rates of hepatocellular carcinoma and more rapid progression to cirrhosis compared to HBV mono-infection.6, 7, 8, 9\n",

HDV IgM is detectable one to three weeks after exposure and remains positive in chronic active infection with levels reflective of disease activity.13 HDV IgG remains present as a marker of either current active or prior resolved infection. Thus, HDV IgG is checked first for chronic HDV screening, and HDV RNA is used to confirm active infection and to follow response to therapy. Since there remains ongoing work to standardize and improve HDV RNA assays, HDV IgM can be tested in those with high clinical suspicion of HDV infection but an undetected RNA level.14\n",

HEV was subsequently named in 1990 to distinguish it from hepatitis A virus, an additional source of waterborne hepatitis epidemics at the time.29 There are 4 known HEV genotypes. Infections with genotypes 1 and 2 are limited to humans and cause disease via consumption of contaminated water. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 cause zoonotic infections with human disease attributed to consumption of raw or undercooked meat, particularly pork and wild game;.30 Thus, HEV endemic outbreaks are related to genotypes 1 and 2 typically in Asia, Africa, and Mexico, and sporadic cases due to genotype 3 and 4 have been observed in nations worldwide.",

By contrast, liver biopsy is often obtained before chronic HEV infection is suspected in the immunosuppressed host since unexplained transaminase elevations is the typical presentation with no other clinical symptoms. In those with known infection, liver biopsy may be beneficial for staging of fibrosis given the potential risk for accelerated progression to cirrhosis. HEV RNA may be detected in the liver biopsy specimen and histopathology ranges from minimal inflammation to clinical features suggestive of mild acute cellular rejection.47 Given the nonspecific findings on histologic examination, HEV RNA should be tested in transplant recipients if a liver biopsy demonstrates chronic hepatitis of uncertain etiology or a nondiagnostic biopsy in setting of persistently abnormal liver chemistries.48\n",

Ribavirin is used and tolerated well for treatment of chronic HEV in SOT recipients at a median dose of 600mg daily (8 mg/kg) for three months and longer treatment courses for six to twelve months in those with partial response or relapse after treatment.52 There is currently one licensed vaccine for hepatitis E (HEV 239, Hecolin) available in China which is derived from 26 KDa protein coded by ORF2 of HEV1.53\n",

Transmission occurs via aerosolized nasopharyngeal secretions or direct contact with fluid from vesicular lesions. VZV-associated hepatitis has been rarely reported in the literature but can present similarly to HSV hepatitis.56 Liver biopsy will typically look similar to HSV hepatitis though diagnosis is made by checking serum VZV PCR. Similar to HSV, treatment with acyclovir is recommended. In immunocompromised hosts, varicella zoster immune globulin may be considered if known exposure occurs.57 An inactivated zoster vaccine (Shingrix) is now available and recommended for post-transplant and other immunocompromised patients.58\n",

However, acute liver failure due to EBV is less common, accounting for one in 500 cases of the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) and may occur in young and immunocompetent individuals, unlike the other herpesviruses that typically only lead to ALF in the immunocompromised.60 After primary infection, the virus becomes latent in the memory B cells.61 EBV PCR and in situ hybridization of liver tissue can be used to identify the presence of virus although confirmation of EBV-related hepatitis also requires the appropriate clinical features including transaminase elevations with serologies (viral capsid IgG/IgM and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen antibody and EBV DNA).62 Virtually all cases of EBV hepatitis are self-limited but rare cases of severe hepatitis or ALF may require liver transplantation.",

Diagnosis requires biopsy of the affected organ which is typically an excisional biopsy of an enlarged lymph node.

Preemptive antiviral therapy with valganciclovir has been recommended for SOT recipients at risk, particularly those with no evidence of prior CMV exposure, that is CMV IgG is negative, who receive allografts from CMV IgG positive donors.68 Oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir may be used to treat CMV hepatitis depending upon the severity of illness.",
