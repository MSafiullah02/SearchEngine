Few are also identically expressed between mice and men.5 This suggests two possibilities: that more translatable M\u03a6 markers remain to be identified or there is an abundance of surface markers with continuous distributions that have rendered themselves inappropriate for traditional immunophenotyping.

This asks whether a similar approach can be applied to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is mechanistically heterogeneous and involves high patient symptom burdens, which manifest independently of severe lung function decline.8, 9 In particular, recent reports of a hyper-inflammatory COPD patient subgroup with increased disease mortality and acute lung exacerbations risk suggest that inflammatory and non-inflammatory disease endotypes may exist in COPD.9, 10 This concept is emphasized by the existence of both immune and non-immune driven mechanisms of emphysema induction in mice.11, 12, 13 Interestingly, in mice, deletion of Src homology 2 domain-containing 5\u2019 inositol phosphatase-1 (Inpp5d or SHIP-1; a negative regulator of growth factor receptor\u2013mediated myeloid cell activation and survival) or constitutive activation of Hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck; a Src-family kinase abundant in myelomonocytic cells) both lead to the spontaneous development of chronic inflammatory lung disease sharing features of human COPD. SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice develop AM\u03a6-driven chronic lung inflammation, severe emphysema,14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and COPD co-morbidities, such as wasting, osteoporosis and an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections.19, 20, 21 HckF/F gain-of-function mice, generated by a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution (Y499F) in the regulatory domain which prevents Hck inactivation, develop airway mucus metaplasia and mild emphysema characterized by chronic eosinophilic and monocytic lung inflammation and are hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).22 Further study of SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mouse models may thus help refine the search for hyper-inflammatory COPD endotypes.",

This easily adoptable approach compares CD11b expression levels on AM\u03a6s with anchor CD11b expression levels in blood neutrophils and additionally identifies CD11b AM\u03a6 upregulation as a hallmark of acute lung exacerbations in SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Overall, our study incorporates AM\u03a6 phenotyping with other preexisting parameters for clinical endotyping (the presence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia) to demonstrate that innate lung immunophenotypes exist heterogeneously in both mouse models of chronic inflammatory lung disease and human patients.",

Under selective inflammatory conditions, CD11b expression is upregulated and differential CD11bpos AM\u03a6 proportions can distinguish between the peak and resolution of acute lung inflammation, respectively.15 This scenario (either an absence or presence of inflammation-associated CD11bpos AM\u03a6s) is ideal for immunophenotyping as binary CD11b expression negates interpretation ambiguities and excessive standardization procedures. In translating this to human patient samples, however, we discovered that CD11b was basally expressed on all human AM\u03a6s but varied noticeably between individual patients (Figure 1a). As M\u03a6 markers rarely directly translate between man and mouse, we screened for other putative M\u03a6 activation markers such as CD14, CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II, CD124, CD206, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, and TLR-4 but observed consistently high or low surface expression levels (data not shown).",

Unfortunately, flow cytometry measurement of markers with a continuous distribution loses quantitative meaning outside single experiments as expression is presented as a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), a value which changes with cell autofluorescence, antibody (Ab) signal strength, and laser voltage settings. As MFI values are relative, large-scale clinical usage becomes limited even with single peak autofluorescent bead set-ups, as bead values still fluctuate within a small range between experiments and may diminish over time, hampering diagnostic accuracy. Thus, with continuous AM\u03a6 CD11b expression as our marker of interest, we explored whether alternative analytical methods could still detect distinct lung immune cell profiles in both mice and humans using flow cytometry. To do this, we re-examined established mouse models of acute and chronic lung inflammation for potential internal anchors of AM\u03a6 CD11b expression (gating strategy in Supplementary Figure S1 online).",

Similarly, we found that blood neutrophil CD11b expression remained constant in mice that spontaneously developed inflammatory lung disease (SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mice; Figure 1c and Supplementary Table S1 online). In acute lung challenge studies, day 3 post-LPS challenge and day 10 post-influenza virus infection were chosen as they represent the peak of acute lung inflammation and initiation of disease resolution after virus is cleared, respectively, in these two different inflammatory conditions. In contrast to Mem71 infection, resolution at day 10 post-LPS challenge is characterized by a restoration to the homeostatic CD11bneg AM\u03a6 phenotype.15 In mice, blood neutrophils were CD11bpos with a staining intensity between the expression range of CD11bneg and CD11bhighCD11chigh AM\u03a6s, providing an internal reference point to which AM\u03a6 CD11b expression could be compared (Figure 1b,c). This approach negates influences from Ab signal strength and laser voltage settings on MFI level, as the ratio of AM\u03a6 to blood neutrophil CD11b expression remains internally constant (see Supplementary Figure S2a and Supplementary Table S1 online). Differences in AM\u03a6 CD11b expression and the appearance of CD11bhighCD11cpos or CD11bposCD11cneg cell subsets were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from C57BL/6 mice following LPS challenge and Mem71 influenza virus clearance and in SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mice (see Supplementary Figure S2b,c and Supplementary Table S1 online).16, 17, 22 Increased AM\u03a6 to blood neutrophil CD11b expression profiles were also observed for increasing LPS doses at day 3 post-challenge in C57BL/6 mice (see Supplementary Figure S2d online). Critically, distinct BAL cell profiles could be identified in animal models with different lung tissue histopathology (Figure 1d,e).",

SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mice have spontaneous inflammatory and emphysematous phenotypes that resemble patterns observed in human COPD.16, 17, 22 To test whether specific BAL profiles could also be discerned during COPD-like acute lung exacerbations, SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mice were challenged with a single intranasal dose of LPS. LPS-challenged SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mice both developed exacerbated lung pathology resembling acute lung pneumonia by day 3 post-LPS challenge (Figure 3). In SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice, acute exacerbations were characterized by CD11bhighCD11cpos monocyte recruitment and further AM\u03a6 CD11b upregulation (Figure 3a\u2013c,m). Exacerbation severity as evidenced by increased lung hemorrhaging, posture changes, piloerection, and increased respiratory effort was variable (data not shown) and correlated with the degree of AM\u03a6 CD11b upregulation visualized as a rightwards signal shift of AM\u03a6 CD11b expression compared with blood neutrophils (Figure 3c). Neutrophil, monocyte, and T lymphocyte numbers were also increased in LPS-challenged SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3d\u2013f). AM\u03a6 CD11b upregulation and lung monocyte recruitment were also characteristic of LPS-challenged HckF/F mice (Figure 3i,n). Upregulated AM\u03a6 CD11b expression was modest compared with challenged SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice and did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3i,n, *P=0.087). Heightened lung neutrophil recruitment was the dominant feature of challenged HckF/F mice, with no alterations in lung eosinophil numbers (Figure 3j). Interestingly, lung tissue and immune cell apoptosis was found in HckF/F but not SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 acute lung exacerbations (see Supplementary Figure S4 online). Altogether, these results demonstrate that increased CD11b AM\u03a6 expression is a mouse marker of active lung inflammation with differential patterns of AM\u03a6 CD11b upregulation and eosinophil, neutrophil, or monocyte recruitment present in acute and chronic inflammatory lung conditions as well as COPD acute exacerbation models.",

Intranasal anti-CD11b Ab administration 24 h post-LPS challenge attenuated lung inflammation by significantly decreasing lung neutrophil and monocyte infiltration in C57BL/6 mice 3 days post-LPS challenge (Figure 4a\u2013d). Interestingly, AM\u03a6 numbers remained unchanged following anti-CD11b Ab administration (Figure 4d), suggesting that anti-CD11b blocked surface AM\u03a6 CD11b expression rather than depleting CD11bpos AM\u03a6s. Anti-CD11b Ab administration demonstrated a dose-dependent preferential neutralization of CD11bhigh neutrophils before CD11bhigh lung monocytes and CD11bpos AM\u03a6s (Figure 4e). Anti-CD11b also attenuated lung neutrophilia in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4f,g).

As human lung monocytes are CD33posCD11bhigh and potentially similar to CD33posCD11bhigh AM\u03a6s, monocytes were excluded from our gating strategy based on their lack of autofluorescence and smaller size (low forward scatter (FSC)) to eliminate signal contamination (see Supplementary Figure S7b online). Despite this, an additional CD33lowCD11bhigh immune cell subset was still prominent in the BAL of a subset of human patients (Figure 5d, subset E). This subset showed negligible Class II, CD14, or CD86 expression (Figure 5e) and was identified as lung eosinophils from cell differentials of BAL cytospins (Figure 5f; granular cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm as denoted by white arrows). This allowed the inclusion of lung eosinophilia as a parameter for immunophenotyping, similar to mice. The degree of lung neutrophilia, another preestablished parameter for COPD and asthma patient immunophenotyping, could simultaneously be measured as the proportion of granular CD15highCD11bhigh cells in BAL(see Supplementary Figure S1 online and Figure 6a\u2013d, pie charts).",

Using these parameters, we analyzed human BAL from a randomly sampled pool of patients undergoing bronchoscopies for clinical diagnosis (see Supplementary Table S3 online). Human patients could be broadly segregated into one of four lung immunophenotypes: into patients with (a) only CD11blow AM\u03a6s, (b) only CD11bmod AM\u03a6s, (c) only CD11bhigh AM\u03a6s, and (d) CD11bmod/high AM\u03a6s with eosinophilia or atypical myeloid cell infiltration (Figure 6a\u2013d). Surprisingly, this mirrored the distinct immunophenotypes observed in C57BL/6 compared with SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mice. Patients with CD11blow AM\u03a6s (set as having \u2a7d10% AM\u03a6s with higher CD11b expression than blood neutrophils) showed low neutrophil and monocyte infiltration and most closely resembled the BAL phenotype of healthy C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6a). Patients with CD11bmod AM\u03a6s were arbitrarily characterized to serve as an intermediate subgroup (with 10\u201340% CD11bpos AM\u03a6s with higher CD11b expression than blood neutrophils) to distinguish between patients with obvious CD11blow AM\u03a6 or CD11bhigh AM\u03a6 phenotypes (Figure 6b). Patients with CD11bhigh AM\u03a6s (\u2a7e40% AM\u03a6s with higher CD11b expression than blood neutrophils) but negligible monocyte or eosinophil recruitment greatly resembled the immunophenotype of SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice and showed increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proportions in BAL (Figure 6c). Patients with CD11bmod/high AM\u03a6s and lung eosinophilia resembled the BAL cell immunophenotype of HckF/F mice or C57BL/6 mice during the clearance phase of influenza infection (Figure 6d). Interestingly, a unique subset of CD33highCD11blow non-lymphocyte cells was additionally found in the BAL of PT5012 (Figure 6d). These atypical myeloid cells were lobe-specific to disease pathology (see Supplementary Figure S8 online).",

Our results demonstrate that patients with CD11blow or CD11bhigh AM\u03a6s exist and can be identified in a directly comparable manner. To represent AM\u03a6 CD11b expression in an unbiased manner, we additionally calculated AM\u03a6 CD11b MFIs and AM\u03a6 to blood neutrophil CD11b MFI ratios for each patient (Figure 6a\u2013d and Supplementary Table S2 online). MFI values fluctuate between individual experiments even with the usage of single peak fluorescent beads. However, patients categorized into the subgroups A and C were clearly distinguished by all calculation parameters (see Supplementary Table S2 online). As additional confirmation of CD11b selective AM\u03a6 expression heterogeneity, we simultaneously measured AM\u03a6 CD14 expression in the same experiment. In contrast to CD11b, CD14 AM\u03a6 surface expression remained relatively constant between individual patients independently of AM\u03a6 CD11b expression differences or lung disease status (Figure 6a\u2013d). Moreover, while blood neutrophil CD11b expression was relatively constant between patients, blood vs. lung neutrophil CD11b upregulation was observed in LPS-challenged C57BL/6 mice, SHIP-1\u2212/\u2212 and HckF/F mice and human patients with similar inflammatory BAL cell profiles (see Supplementary Figure S9a,b online). The degree of blood vs. lung neutrophil CD11b upregulation positively correlated with AM\u03a6 CD11b upregulation (r=0.806) and further distinguished between patients with CD11blow or CD11bmod/high AM\u03a6s, providing an additional parameter of local lung inflammation (see Supplementary Figure S9b online).",

AM\u03a6s are the predominant immune cell population within the lung parenchyma and express an expansive repertoire of cell surface molecules, which dynamically reorganize in response to different environmental stimuli.29 Theoretically, this should render them as more selective reporters of the inflammatory microenvironment compared with current parameters such as lung neutrophilia or eosinophilia, which only indicate immune subset presence and not phenotype.",

            "text": "A second obstacle lies in the difficulty of translating candidate M\u03a6 markers from animal or in vitro studies. Few surface markers are similarly expressed on mouse and human AM\u03a6s. Translatable M\u03a6 activation markers are so far limited to several chemokines, scavenger receptors, and matrix proteins.5 As the only cell surface receptors from the list, scavenger receptors are the most pragmatic candidates for immunophenotyping. However, apart from MARCO,36 few scavenger receptors are even dually expressed on mouse and human AM\u03a6s, let alone in parallel stimuli-selective patterns. More importantly, the expression of these and many other classes of M\u03a6 surface proteins is predominantly continuous.37, 38 Continuously expressed markers are represented as MFIs, which permits semi-quantitative comparisons within single flow cytometry experiments but hinders comparisons and data replication between independent studies. MFIs also do not provide information about cell population spread, may be altered by different gating strategies, and can be inadvertently skewed by extremely low or high value false events captured, future questioning their usefulness as meaningful clinical readouts. Thus, without alternative study strategies, many future candidate human M\u03a6 markers may be rejected in the screening process in favor of binary observations, which are biologically unlikely. A conventional myeloid cell parameter would be the frequency of CD14posCD16neg pro-inflammatory monocytes, CD14posCD16pos vs. CD14lowCD16pos patrolling monocytes in individual patients,39 which can be used to describe the local environment in terms of recruited monocyte phenotypes. However, residential M\u03a6s possess different and often opposing functions to recruited monocytes and an understanding of residential M\u03a6 responses may provide a more accurate reflection of the local inflammatory state. Using our flow cytometry approach, we show that AM\u03a6 CD11b upregulation occurs in both mice and human patients alongside other inflammatory changes despite basal CD11b expression on human AM\u03a6s. In particular, our studies suggest that CD11bhigh AM\u03a6s may identify an important subset of patients with inflammatory lung conditions and that a combinational immunophenotyping approach that monitors AM\u03a6 CD11b expression alongside the absence or presence of other innate immune cell subsets may provide a more personalized understanding of individual patient lung microenvironments.",

            "text": "CD11b is a leukocyte integrin composed of the CD11b \u03b1 subunit and common integrin \u03b22 subunit and binds to ligands intercellular adhesion molecule-1, iC3b (cleaved product of complement 3b), and fibrinogen.40 CD11b function was first suggested when a deficiency in the common integrin \u03b22 subunit (and hence LFA-1, CD11b, and p150/95 assembly and surface expression) was identified in a group of patients with recurrent bacterial infections owing to defective neutrophil and myeloid cell adhesion and phagocytosis.41 Later studies identified CD11b upregulation as a functional component of neutrophil aggregation but not neutrophil endothelial cell adhesion or extravasation.42 Surprisingly, global CD11b deletion in mice does not induce prominent physiological alterations or attenuate neutrophil accumulation in inflamed tissues.43, 44 In CD11b\u2212/\u2212 mice, however, complement-mediated phagocytosis and vasculitis are significantly attenuated,43, 44 most likely through a failure of iC3b ligand\u2013mediated activation of CD11b receptor signaling. From our studies, given that anti-CD11b Ab administration but not CD11b deletion attenuated lung inflammation in mice, global CD11b deletion may not replicate the consequences of transiently targeting CD11b in chronic diseases. As blocking of surface AM\u03a6 CD11b rather than depletion of CD11bpos AM\u03a6s most likely occurred following anti-CD11b Ab administration, it is crucial to dissect whether AM\u03a6 CD11b signaling itself or CD11bpos/high AM\u03a6s are potential effectors of acute and chronic lung inflammation. Specifically, the comparison of CD11bneg (or CD11blow in humans) and CD11bpos/high AM\u03a6 transcriptomes may identify whether alterations in CD11b-related signaling pathways or a broader array of effector pathways exist between these two AM\u03a6 subpopulations.",

This may be difficult in places where same-day flow cytometry analysis is not possible and cryopreservation options have to be explored. Cigarette smoke\u2013induced cell autofluorescence is also a major obstacle as background AM\u03a6 signals are exponentially increased in current smokers, confounding fluorescence AM\u03a6 read-outs. Current cigarette smokers (<6 months) were excluded from our study, but this may be undesirable for COPD endotyping. In unavoidable scenarios, it is possible that non-fluorescence detection methods such as mass cytometry may be employed to characterize all samples from a similar baseline, although non-specific Ab-binding issues may still exist.",
