            "text": "Recently, peptide drugs have evolved into mainstream therapeutics, representing a significant portion of the pharmaceutical market. Peptide drugs are advantageous because they are amenable to rational design and exhibit highly diverse structures and broad biological activities. Owing to this superiority, peptide drugs play significant roles as both therapeutics and biomarkers [1], [2], [3]. However, many obstacles must be overcome before peptide drugs can be applied clinically. Peptide drugs have short half-lives in systemic circulation, are easily degraded by proteases in plasma and target cells, are often easily cleared by the reticuloendothelial system and can be immunogenic [4]. New synthetic strategies for limiting metabolism and alternative routes of administration have emerged recently and have resulted in numerous peptide-based drugs that are now being marketed [5]. Nevertheless, new strategies are still urgently needed to solve problems such as nonspecific targeting, poor uptake, low effective biological activity and bioavailability.",

A series of synthetic antiviral peptides have been reported. For example, T-20, a 36-mer peptide derived from the HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41), showed potent inhibition of HIV-1 membrane fusion and virus entry and is now in clinical use in HIV-1-infected patients [6]. Despite the therapeutic potency of T-20, resistant strains have emerged. To achieve fusion inhibition without this setback, a similar peptide (T-1249) was designed and synthesized. The peptide T-1249 was more effective than T-20 even with a single daily administration instead of the two administrations used for T-20 and retained activity against most T-20-resistant strains [7], [8]. Another synthetically derived peptide, C5A, prevented HCV infection by inactivating both extra- and intracellular infectious particles. As a potent anti-HCV peptide, C5A destabilizes the viral membrane based on its lipid composition, offering a unique therapeutic approach to HCV and other types of viral infection [9]. However, improving C5A for clinical use would be challenging. These antiviral peptides still face problems such as drug resistance and bioavailability.",

These small peptides are multifunctional as effectors of innate immunity on the skin and mucosal surfaces and have demonstrated direct antimicrobial activity against various bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites [14]. Natural AMPs from scorpion venoms have attracted much attention due to their antiviral bioactivities. The mutational peptide mucroporin-M1 was shown to be virucidal against the measles, SARS\u2013CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses [15], and inhibited HBV replication in vitro and in vivo\n[16]. A natural \u03b1-helical peptide, Hp1090, was proven to have the property of killing HCV [17]. Another mutational peptide, Kn2-7, was also effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection [18].

However, Ctry2459 cannot suppress an established infection because of its low bioavailability, resulting from the poor cellular uptake and restriction of intracellular endosomes. Since the addition of histidine residues can enhance the helicity, amphiphilicity and endosomal escape of peptides, we try to design histidine-rich peptides from the template of Ctry2459 to improve antiviral activities, cellular uptake and intracellular distribution. The helicity and amphiphilicity of peptides were characterized by circular dichroism (CD). The antiviral activities were studied using real-time RT-QPCR. Confocal microscopy assay was used to investigate the bioavailability. The potential biotoxicity of peptides was characterized by measuring their cytotoxic effect on various cell lines and hemolytic effect on human red blood cells. The overall objective of this study is to enhance the bioavailability and bioactivity of peptide drugs by overcoming cellular barrier.",

By contrast, Ctry2459 was much less inhibitory when added to the cells together with the virus and entirely noninhibitory when added to the cells for 2 h and removed before the virus was added, as well as noninhibitory when added to the cells 4 h after infection. These results suggest that the peptide Ctry2459 only prevented initiation of HCV infection and had no intracellular anti-HCV activity. We speculated that there were some barriers in the infected cells that restricted the action of the peptide Ctry2459. To identify the exact barriers, the cellular localization of Ctry2459 was determined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3C, labeled Ctry2459 peptide slightly entered the cells and accumulated in granular structures in the cytoplasm.

Based on the structure consistency, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 exhibited more effective virucidal activities in vitro than that of Ctry2459 by displaying stronger disruption of the viral integrity (Fig. 6). The cellular uptake of Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 significantly increased, and their intracellular distributions were completely different from the intracellular distribution of Ctry2459. In particular, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 exhibited dispersed distribution in the cytoplasm, indicating the property of endosomal escape. When used as treatments for established HCV infection, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 exhibited a slightly inhibitory effect when added 4 h postinfection, much less inhibition when added 24 h postinfection but stronger inhibition when added 48 h postinfection. The cause may be that at the early state of infection, there were very few mature viral particles in the cytoplasm so that the virucidal effect could not be significantly reflected. However, HCV replicated to high levels 24 h\u201348 h postinfection, and intracellular mature viral particles rapidly accumulated [31]. Therefore, the mutational peptides Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 effectively enter the cells, break through the endosomes, interact with the mature viral particles, and exhibit significant antiviral activities.",

The mechanisms of endosomal escape mostly include the interaction of the peptide with the endosomal membrane and the proton sponge effect: (i) Interaction with the endosomal membrane. The histidine residues are uncharged at neutral pH; however, when the pH of the endosomal lumen drops, the imidazole rings become protonated and can adopt an in-plane orientation at the membrane surface that induces membrane disorder. Hence, pH-induced changes in the peptide charge during endosomal acidification enhance the ability of the escape from the endosome and the ability to reach the cell cytosol and/or, eventually, the nucleus [25], [32]. (ii) Proton sponge effect. Protonation induces an extensive inflow of ions and water into the endosomal environment that subsequently leads to osmotic swelling, endosome rupture and release of the entrapped components [33].",

The peptides were taken up by the cells via endocytosis and were restricted in endosomes. With the acidification of endosomes by H+-ATPase, common peptides would be digested by the enzyme, whereas Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 with endosomal escape properties can easily break through the endosomal barrier. The released peptides in the cytoplasm would be targeted to intracellular HCV particles and act as an antiviral compound.",
