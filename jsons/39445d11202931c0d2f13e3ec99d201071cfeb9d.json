According to recent published data, due to the unforeseen conditions of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients have been prioritized over other patients, unfortunately including cancer patients. [1] Oral cancer therapy at its various stages is intertwined with dental care which aims to improve and maintain oral hygiene in order to reduce the oral complications and enhance the patient's quality of life. [2] Dental care for these patients deals with eradication of foci of oral infection and prevention of potentially life threatening systemic infections of dental origin. A dentist's role also involves prevention and alleviation of pain in the oral cavity, advising and aiding in maintaining adequate nutrition and providing reconstruction or rehabilitation after surgical procedures. [3] Prior to oncotherapy, the dental team must assess the risk of oral disease, plan prosthetic treatments needed such as implants or obturators, extract teeth with questionable prognosis that may act as a foci of infection or are in areas prone to osteoradionecrosis, apart from counselling and motivating the patient for oral hygiene. [4] During oncotherapy, elective dental procedures should be avoided. Management is limited to treatment of acute dental problems and alleviation of symptoms such as management of oral mucositis, xerostomia, trismus and opportunistic infections. [5] After cancer treatment, the dentist aims to help the patient manage the adverse effects, prevent or reduce the incidence of osteoradionecrosis secondary to radiation of jawbones, and ensure maintenance or enhancement of oral status. [6] Hence, a dentist plays multiple roles in palliative as well as therapeutic care, while also motivating the patient for improved oral hygiene.",

Dentists can provide support to patients undergoing radio and/or chemotherapy via telephone and where possible video calls. [9] Dentists must motivate and re-emphasize oral hygiene measures. (Table 1 ) Patients who are going to undergo oncotherapy should be informed about what to anticipate during oncology treatment (such as mucositis, xerostomia and possible dysgeusia), and actions that can be taken to minimise these effects. [10] Patients should be counselled about the need to improve teeth mineralization before oral hygiene maneuvers become difficult to maintain owing to discomfort and the need to thwart the risk of caries that arises due to a dry mouth. The importance of long-term follow-up also needs to be italicized, especially with respect to caries and osteoradionecrosis. [5] In case of any symptoms, dental practitioners can request photographs or radiographs, if needed to help in diagnosis and advise home care measures, where feasible. [9] Constant check-ups, counselling and support via tele-dentistry consultations can be provided, to maintain and improve general overall well being of the patients and consequently, quality of life.",
