Risk factors on admission day 1, day 3 and day 7 in univariate analysis included white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelet, prothrombin time, INR, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine, Na, K, C-reactive protein, albumin, lactate, procalcitonin, pH, PaCO2, Bicarbonate, FiO2, PaO2/FiO2, etc. Variables on admission day 1, admission day 3 and admission day 7, which were possibly associated with ventilator dependence in the univariate analysis (p < 0.1), were included in a multivariate analysis model. A total of 11 variables were included in the multivariate analysis model, such as age >69 years, FiO2 >39%, history of stroke, pH < 7.35, platelet <150,000/\u03bcL, history of coronary artery disease, hemoglobin, BUN, C-reactive protein, PaO2/FiO2 and PaCO2 on admission day 7. After stepwise method, the independent factors associated with ventilator dependence were identified to build a score. A clinical score (VD risk score) was calculated based on four variables independently associated with ventilator dependence in the multivariate analysis, including previous stroke, thrombocytopenia, acidosis, and higher FiO2 (Table 3). The ventilator dependence risk score was calculated as the sum of these four variables after adjusting by proportion to beta coefficient. We assigned a history of stroke one point, platelet count on admission day 7 of less than 150,000/\u03bcL one point, pH value on admission day 7 of less than 7.35 two points, and the fraction of inspired oxygen on admission day 7 over 39% two points (Table 4).",

These included a history of stroke, and data collected on day 7 (thrombocytopenia, acidosis, and a higher fraction of inspired oxygen). The ventilator dependence risk score can help easily predict prolonged mechanical ventilation. We chose biochemical and physiological variables from day 7 to incorporate into our score, as opposed to day 1 or day 21, which would each have advantages and disadvantages. For example, it is too late to predict ventilator dependency using day 21 data. On the other hand, with multiple factors and different treatment response, it is difficult to predict ventilator dependency from day 1 data. With aggressive treatment in the first week, day 7 data can help identify which patients face a substantial risk of becoming long-term ventilator-dependent.",

During sepsis, platelet numbers decrease due to increased platelet destruction. Sepsis may result in hypercoagulation due to fibrin deposition and platelet activation. This leads to the formation of micro-thrombi as a host defense mechanism against pathogens, in which platelets play a crucial role. In extreme situations, this may progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with severe thrombocytopenia and coagulation system impairment23\u201325. Platelet dysfunction during sepsis correlates with a poorer prognosis. Thus, the morphology, number, and function of platelets may be used as biomarkers for the risk stratification of patients with sepsis25. Although we excluded very ill patients with decreased platelet counts who expired within 21 days (in our series, average 152*103/\u03bcL), the platelet count on day 7 could differentiate the ventilator-dependent and independent groups on day 21. A relatively low platelet count on admission day 7 suggests that a septic patient has not completely recovered and may have greater risk of ventilator dependence. Although there was a significantly lower hemoglobin level in the ventilator-dependent group, it is hard to suggest that bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia is causing weaning failure. The hemoglobin level in both groups was greater than 10 g/dl.",

Sepsis can cause tissue hypoperfusion and the accumulation of lactate, which causes metabolic acidosis26. Acidosis resolution in survivors was attributable to a decrease in strong ion gap and lactate levels26. Additionally, respiratory acidosis can be due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the lungs, which indicates poor lung functioning27. Our data revealed that arterial blood gas acidosis on day 7 was one of the independent risk factors predicting ventilator dependence. We did not find statistical differences between groups on higher lactate levels or vasopressor use trends in ventilator dependent patients. Acidosis could be non gap metabolic acidosis from hyperchloremia and fluid overload. In addition, either sepsis progression or poor lung functioning may have caused the resulting acidosis. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is the fraction or percentage of oxygen in the volume being measured. It is used to represent the percentage of oxygen participating in gas exchange. According to a study by Diniz et al., FiO2 levels sufficient to ensure a SpO2 \u226592% do not alter breathing patterns or trigger clinical changes in weaning patients28.

We do not suggest correction of thrombocytopenia and acidosis by blood transfusion and bicarbonate use, as there are inherent risks with platelet transfusion and bicarbonate infusion. However, the clinical physician should make the best efforts in correcting underlying progressive sepsis to avoid prolonged ventilator use.

Despite these findings, the PaO2/FiO2 and GCS AUC were not better than the ventilator dependence risk score AUC (Fig. 3). In fact, we have previously described an immune dysfunction scoring system for predicting 28-day mortality in septic patients, with better discrimination than SOFA score; this system was valid and reproducible. The above cases were from part of the current sepsis cohort, who agreed for immune function assessment29.

From our results, the data from day 7 is enough to calculate the score, which makes it feasible to use for predicting ventilator dependence. Patients require mechanical ventilation due to either pulmonary function problems or neurological function problems. In patients with sepsis, both components may co-exist. It is difficult to delineate what proportion of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is attributed to pulmonary or neurological problems. We did not incorporate any data on the patients\u2019 pulmonary system mechanics or respiratory muscle strength (respiratory system compliance or resistance, maximal exhaled tidal volume, negative inspiratory force, rapid shallow breathing index) that are typically studied during weaning from mechanical ventilation33.

Most importantly, obtaining parameters like static compliance requires an additional procedure such as paralysis and muscle relaxant, which may add risk to those patients with unstable severe sepsis.

Consecutive adult patients (aged \u226518 years) with acute respiratory failure on admission to the medical ICU with sepsis/septic shock were surveyed from August 2013 to October 2015 through chart review. We excluded patients who passed away within 21 days, those whose families requested palliative treatment before day 21, and those who were already long-term mechanical ventilator dependent. The enrolled patients were divided into two groups, i.e., ventilator-independent and ventilator-dependent, according to their ventilator status at the time of ventilator use on day 21 from the chart review (Fig. 1). We also collected data from sepsis/septic shock patients with respiratory failure who were admitted to the medical ICU from November 2015 to November 2016 as the validation group (Fig. 2).",

All enrolled patients met the new criteria for sepsis and required mechanical ventilation at the time of admission to the ICU. Moreover, they survived for at least 21 days after admission to the ICU. IV titratable sedation was applied if the patient\u2019s condition required and the titration protocol was standardized by medical intensive care unit.

Variables associated with ventilator dependence in the univariate analysis (p < 0.1) were included in a multivariate analysis model. Using the stepwise method, the independent factors associated with ventilator dependence were identified to build a score using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. A clinical score (VD risk score) was calculated based on four variables independently associated with ventilator dependence in the multivariate analysis. The number of points assigned to each variable in the VD score was adjusted according to proportion to beta coefficient in the regression model. The VD risk score is the sum of the points for these four variables. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of the VD risk score.",
