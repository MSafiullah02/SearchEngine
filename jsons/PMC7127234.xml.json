            "text": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV, EC 3.4.14.5, CD26) is a multifunctional serine protease enzyme with key roles in the control of endocrine and immune function, cell metabolism, growth and adhesion (Hildebrandt et al., 2000). As an enzyme, DPP-IV cleaves the N-terminal dipeptide of many biologically active peptides (such as incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) from the oligopeptide chain with proline or alanine at the second position (Mentlein, 1999). DPP-IV is widely expressed in various tissues or cells (high mRNA levels and abundant protein levels in the kidney and small intestine) as a membrane-anchored cell surface protein or as a soluble form in the plasma and other body fluids (Kameoka et al., 1993, Kim et al., 2014, Uhl\u00e9n et al., 2015). The ubiquitous expression and the enzymatic actions of DPP-IV make this enzyme to be involved in many biological or pathological processes, including the regulation of glucose metabolism (Drucker and Nauck, 2006, Egan et al., 2014). Besides of being a famous therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, DPP-IV also exhibits co-stimulatory role in T-cell activation, adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, and serves as the functional receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (Ohnuma et al., 2008, Raj et al., 2013). Recently, DPP-IV has come back into the centre of attention as a novel molecular marker or a potential therapeutic target for cancer (Cordero et al., 2009, Javidroozi et al., 2012, Dahan et al., 2014, Arrebola et al., 2014, Davies et al., 2015). Furthermore, increasing evidence has demonstrated that the abnormal presence or altered level of DPP-IV in plasma can serve as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of many diseases, including cholestasis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and lung diseases (Perner et al., 1999, Firneisz et al., 2010, S\u00e1nchez-Otero et al., 2014). Thus, the accurate measurement of DPP-IV in complex biological samples, especially in plasma, is of great importance for disease diagnosis, drug discovery and clinical practice.",

            "text": "Recent years have witnessed a rapid expansion in the use of small molecule fluorescent probes to detect and monitor the key enzymes in human biological processes, due to their inherent advantages including high selectivity and sensitivity, non-destructiveness, easy management and capability of being applicable to high-throughput detection (Ueno and Nagano, 2011, Vendrell et al., 2012). Notably, dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are two highly homologous prolyl-cleaving dipeptidases, and the substrate spectra of FAP and DPPs (such as DPP-IV, DPP8 and DPP9) are commonly overlapped (Waumans et al., 2015). Up to date, most of DPP-IV substrates were found to be cleaved by FAP, DPP8 and DPP9 as well (Ajami et al., 2008, Keane et al., 2011, Lu et al., 2011). Although several fluorescent probes for DPP-IV have been developed and used in vitro bioassays, these probes do not have enough isoform selectivity to precisely evaluate the real activities of DPP-IV in complex biological systems, such as living cells and body fluids (Grant et al., 2002, Ho et al., 2006, Kawaguchi et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016, Gong et al., 2016). Furthermore, almost all reported fluorescent probes for DPP-IV work with one photo microscopy (OPM) and monitor DPP-IV activity by intensity-responsive fluorescence signal, which can be easily interfered with the excitation and emission efficiency, probe concentration, biological matrix and environmental conditions (Zipfel et al., 2003). In contrast to traditional single-photon excited fluorescent probes, two-photon excited (TPE) fluorescent probes are induced by two-photon excitation with near-infrared (NIR) photons, which can minimize auto-fluorescence background, reduce phototoxicity or photo-damage to biological samples and increase specimen penetration, and thus more suitable for deep-tissue bioimaging and 3D imaging in living systems (Helmchen and Denk, 2005; Kim and Cho, 2015). These advantages make the TPE fluorescent probes excellent tools to investigate biomolecules in living cells and living tissues (Miao et al., 2014, Dai et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015, Li et al., 2017). However, to the best of our knowledge, the TPE fluorescent probes for highly selective detection of DPP-IV in complex biological systems have not been reported yet. Thus it is urgently desirable to develop an isoform specific TPE probe for sensing DPP-IV in body fluids and living systems.",

Particularly, DPP-IV prefers to hydrolyze the substrates with proline at the second position and the glycine at the terminal position (Grant et al., 2002, Ho et al., 2006). These facts inspired us that it is possible to develop a preferred fluorescent substrate for DPP-IV by introduction of a Gly-Pro substitute on a basic fluorophore. In this context, a ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe (GP-BAN) was designed for sensing DPP-IV on the basis of the substrate preference of this key enzyme and the principle of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Specifically, N-butyl-4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide was selected as the basic fluorophore due to its desirable photophysical properties including large Stokes shifts, high photostability and significant two-photon absorbability at near infrared wavelength (Zhang et al., 2011, Hettiarachchi et al., 2014, Jin et al., 2015). The probe GP-BAN was synthesized by the incorporation of a glycylprolyl (Gly-Pro) group into BAN\nvia amidation, which served as a reserved metabolic site for DPP-IV (\nScheme 1). The detailed synthetic procedure for GP-BAN was provided in Scheme S1, while the chemical structure of GP-BAN was fully characterized by HRMS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Figs. S1\u2013S3).",

The metabolite was identified as BAN by comparison of LC retention times, UV and MS spectra with the standard (Fig. S4). To demonstrate the ratiometric feature of the GP-BAN/BAN system, the UV\u2013vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of GP-BAN with or without DPP-IV were depicted. As shown in Fig. S5a, GP-BAN exhibited an absorption band at 360 nm in phosphate buffer saline (PBS)-acetonitrile (v/v =1:1, pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C), and the solution was colorless due to the strong electron-withdrawal effect of the glycylprolyl moiety. In sharp contrast, upon addition of DPP-IV, the absorption at 360 nm decreased evidently, while a new absorption band at 430 nm emerged. Such a large red shift in the absorption behaviour changed the colour of the solution from colorless to yellow, indicating that GP-BAN can serve as a \u2018\u2018naked-eye\u2019\u2019 colorimetric indicator for DPP-IV. Consistently, the maximum emission peak also underwent a desirable red-shift from 455 to 535 nm upon addition of DPP-IV (Fig. S5b). The desirable red-shifted emission after hydrolysis should be attributed to the stronger ICT efficiency of the released amino compound BAN. Further investigations showed that GP-BAN is quite stable in the pH range from 2.0 to 7.8, while the pH values do not affect the fluorescence intensity of both GP-BAN and BAN over the pH range of 2.0\u20137.8 (Fig. S6). The fluorescence quantum yields of GP-BAN and BAN in PBS-acetonitrile (v/v =1:1) were also determined as 0.45 and 0.67, respectively, by using fluorescein as the standard. These findings suggested that GP-BAN could function properly under physiological conditions (pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C).",

As shown in\nFig. 1, only DPP-IV can elicit a marked increase in the fluorescence intensity at 535 nm, while the fluorescence intensity at 455 nm is decreased dramatically. In sharp contrast, other hydrolases including carbonic anhydrase (CA), trypsin, pepsin, butyryl-cholinesterase (BChE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), proteinase K, human serum albumin (HSA), lysozyme, Lipase, \u03b1-acidoglycoprotein, human carboxylesterases (hCE1 and hCE2), and other human prolyl-cleaving dipeptidases including FAP, DPP-VIII, and DPP-IX led to negligible changes in fluorescence intensity. Notably, the rate of GP-BAN hydrolysis in DPP-IV is 22-fold higher than that in DPP-IX, and 125-fold higher than that in other DPP-VIII, suggesting that GP-BAN is an isoform specific probe for DPP-IV. Furthermore, the fluorescence performance of GP-BAN toward DPP-IV cannot be influenced by common biological metallic ions or amino acids in human tissues or fluids (Fig. S8). All these findings clearly demonstrate that GP-BAN displays an excellent specificity for DPP-IV over other human hydrolases and biologically relevant species in human tissues or fluids and thus holds great promise for highly selective detection of DPP-IV in complex biological samples.",

As shown in Fig. S9, the formation of BAN is time and DPP-IV dependent, the formation rates of BAN in DPP-IV are linear with the incubation time up to 60 min, while the ratio of fluorescence intensities (535 nm/455 nm) exhibits a good linearity (R2 >0.98) to the increasing concentrations of DPP-IV in the range from 0 to 80 ng/mL. The detection limit (3\u03c3/slope) of GP-BAN for DPP-IV is also estimated as 0.78 ng/mL (7.43 pmol/L). It has been reported that the concentrations of DPP-IV in human serum have been determined ranging from 200 ng/mL to 700 ng/mL, while its expression levels in other tissues including kidney, liver and intestine are much higher than that in serum (Cordero et al., 2009). Thus, the sensitivity of GP-BAN is high enough to determine DPP-IV in human plasma or other complex biological samples. In addition, we compared the detection limits of GP-BAN and GP-AMC (a commercially available fluorescent probe for DPP-IV) using various concentrations of human DPP-IV. Under identical conditions, the sensitivity of the GP-BAN was about 4-fold more sensitive than that of GP-AMC. Such high sensitivity may be attributed to the very high catalytic efficacy of DPP-IV mediated GP-BAN hydrolysis, as well as to the high fluorescence intensity of BAN.",

Herein, the enzymatic kinetics of GP-BAN hydrolysis was well-characterized in different enzyme sources including DPP-IV, HKM and HIM. As depicted in Fig. S10, GP-BAN hydrolysis in DPP-IV, HKM and HIM followed the classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which was evidenced by the corresponding Eadie-Hofstee plots. The kinetic parameters for GP-BAN hydrolysis in different enzyme sources were listed in Table S1. It is evident from Table S1 that the K\nm value for GP-BAN hydrolysis in DPP-IV (42.93 \u03bcM) is very similar to that in HKM (48.04 \u03bcM) and HIM (41.46 \u03bcM), suggesting that DPP-IV plays predominant role in GP-BAN hydrolysis in human kidney and intestine. In order to compare the kinetic parameters for GP-BAN hydrolysis with other known probe reactions for DPP-IV, the kinetic parameters for GP-AMC hydrolysis in DPP-IV were determined under the same conditions (pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C). As shown in Fig. S11, DPP-IV mediated GP-AMC hydrolysis also followed classic Michaelis-Menten kinetic, with the apparent K\nm and V\nmax values as 237.80 \u03bcM and 9.01 \u03bcmol/min/mg protein. It is evident from these results that DPP-IV displays a relatively high affinity towards GP-BAN (with the K\nm value of 42.93 \u03bcM) and a higher hydrolytic efficiency (with the V\nmax value of 15.49 \u03bcmol/min/mg protein) (Grant et al., 2002). As a result, the catalytic efficacy (V\nmax/K\nm) for GP-BAN hydrolysis in DPP-IV (360.82 mL/min/mg protein) is about 10-fold of that for GP-AMC hydrolysis in DPP-IV (37.89 mL/min/mg protein). These results demonstrated that GP-BAN was a good substrate for DPP-IV and displayed excellent kinetic behaviours, which encourage us to apply this probe reaction as an efficient tool to quantify trace DPP-IV in complex biological samples.",

These tissue preparations showed extremely different DPP-IV activities, while HKM showed the highest DPP-IV activity (Fig. S12a). These results were further validated by ELISA (Fig. S12b), and a good relevance was observed between the rate of GP-BAN hydrolysis and DPP-IV protein levels among various human tissues. These results demonstrated that GP-BAN could be used to sensitively determine the real activities of DPP-IV in complex biological samples, and the quantification was highly reliable.",

As shown in Fig. S13, about 4-fold variations in the catalytic activity of DPP-IV in human plasma were observed, which is in good agreement with the previously reported results in individual differences in DPP-IV activity in human plasma (Durinx et al., 2001). Furthermore, an ELISA method was used to determine the DPP-IV levels in these plasma samples, and the results agreed well with the rates of GP-BAN hydrolysis in these samples (\nFig. 2). These findings strongly suggested that GP-BAN could serve as a novel tool to detect trace amounts of DPP-IV in complex biological samples including diluted plasma. Given that DPP-IV served as a potential biomarker or target for many diseases, GP-BAN hold great promise for disease diagnosis and clinical practice.",

To this end, two known DPP-IV inhibitors including sitagliptin and vildagliptin were used, while their inhibitory effects on DPP-IV mediated GP-BAN hydrolysis in recombinant human DPP-IV, human plasma and HIM were assayed by a microplate reader with a 96-well microplate (\nFig. 3 and Fig. S14). As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the inhibitory tendency and the IC50 values of each inhibitor in both DPP-IV and human plasma were very similar. For instance, the IC50 values of sitagliptinon against DPP-IV in recombinant and human plasma were evaluated as 13.00 nM, and 16.59 nM, respectively. These results clearly shown that human plasma could be used as the enzyme source instead of expensive recombinant or purified DPP-IV for screening of DPP-IV inhibitors. Notably, the plasma needs to be 100-fold diluted by PBS for the GP-BAN-based assays, which means that only 2 \u03bcL of plasma is enough for DPP-IV related assays by using GP-BAN as probe substrate. Therefore, GP-BAN could serve as a promising tool for high-throughput screening (HTS) of DPP-IV inhibitors by using readily available human plasma as enzyme source in the field of drug discovery. Given that DPP-IV inhibitors are commonly used in clinical, it is urgently necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of a given DPP-IV inhibitor against DPP-IV among different individuals. Thus, GP-BAN holds a great promise to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic drugs targeting DPP-IV and to guide the dosage adjustment for precision medicine in future.",

As shown in Fig. S15, both GP-BAN and BAN could be excited with near-infrared light (two-photon absorption), while the two-photon action cross section (\u03b4) values of both substrate and product were much close under excitation at 805 nm (about 600 g).

S16 and S17, both of GP-BAN and BAN exhibited relatively poor cytotoxicity to living hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells, as evidenced by the more than 80% cell viability of these two cell lines upon addition of GP-BAN (25 \u03bcM) or BAN (25 \u03bcM) at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. In these cases, GP-BAN (25 \u03bcM) was co-incubated with HepG2 and Caco-2 cells, and the confocal fluorescence images were recorded both in one- and two-photon modes. As shown in\nFig. 4 and Fig. S19, HepG2 and Caco-2 cells loaded with GP-BAN (25 \u03bcM) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C showed an obvious strong green fluorescence (for BAN) and dim blue fluorescence (for GP-BAN) when excited at 805 nm. In contrast, following pretreatment of living cells with vildagliptin (a potent DPP-IV inhibitor, 50 \u03bcM), the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly in the green channel and increased evidently in the blue channel (Fig. 4e\u2013h, Fig. S19e\u2013h). It was evident that the changes in fluorescence response were DPP-IV dependent. The consistent changes in fluorescence were also observed in one photon microscopy (Figs. S18 and S20). To further validate the specific hydrolysis of GP-BAN by endogenous DPP-IV, chemical inhibition assays were also conducted in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells lysates. The results demonstrated that vildagliptin could remarkably reduce the formation of BAN in cells lysates from HepG2 and Caco-2 cells (Figs. S21 and S22). All these data clearly showed that GP-BAN could serve as a specific probe for both single-photon and two-photon-excited bioimaging and for sensing the real activities of DPP-IV in living cells.",

As shown in Fig. S23, vildagliptin could strongly inhibit the hydrolysis of GP-BAN in mouse kidney preparations, implying that GP-BAN hydrolysis in mouse kidney is mediated by DPP-IV. In this case, GP-BAN was co-incubated with mouse kidney slice in PBS (pH =7.4 at 37 \u00b0C) for 60 min and subsequently washed with PBS three times to remove the residual probe before confocal fluorescence imaging. As shown in\nFig. 5, the application of GP-BAN in mouse kidney imaging was demonstrated by using a laser scanning confocal microscope under femtosecond laser excitation at 805 nm. Strong fluorescence was observed from green channel (495\u2013540 nm) and the depth of tissue penetration was as far as 250 \u00b5m, indicating that GP-BAN displayed good capability of tissue penetration and was suitable for direct two-photon fluorescent depth imaging of trace DPP-IV in living tissues.

The newly developed probe displays excellent selectivity toward DPP-IV over other human hydrolases including FAP, DPP-VIII and DPP-IX. GP-BAN can be efficiently hydrolyzed by DPP-IV and release BAN which brings significant changes in both colour and fluorescence emission spectrum, allowing the naked-eye visible and fluorescence analysis. Furthermore, both GP-BAN and BAN exhibit excellent two-photon properties, which could be excited with near-infrared light to avoid interference of biological matrix and photodamage to living sample. Further biological applications demonstrate that GP-BAN can be used to measure DPP-IV in complex biological samples such as plasma and tissue preparations, as well as to monitor endogenous DPP-IV in living systems with high ratiometric imaging resolution and deep-tissue imaging depth. All these findings suggest that GP-BAN can serve as a highly specific fluorescent probe to image DPP-IV in complex biological systems and to explore the biological functions and medicinal roles of endogenous DPP-IV in living systems.",
