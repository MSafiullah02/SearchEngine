During these visits, all inhabitants were registered. Of the 145 children aged 0\u201310 years present in the 5 communities at the time of survey, 40 (28%) were diagnosed with an ARTI, including AOM. Nasopharyngeal samples were taken of these children and of 40 nearest-age full sibling controls aged 0\u201310 years and within 5 years of patient age. When several siblings fulfilled these eligibility criteria, the sibling whose age was nearest to that of the case was included. When no siblings fulfilled these criteria (n = 3), the nearest-age cousin living in the same household was included as a matched control. Nasopharyngeal samples were also taken of mothers of the included children (n = 43). As nasopharyngeal samples alone may be insufficient to detect colonization by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae,22 oropharyngeal swabs for bacterial isolation were taken as well. Nasopharyngeal samples for bacterial and viral isolation were obtained with a flexible swab (Copan Italia). Oropharyngeal samples were obtained by use of rigid cotton-tipped applicators. Swabs were transported at 4\u00b0C\u20137\u00b0C within 4 h after sampling, in STGG medium23 for bacterial isolation and in TE (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) for virus isolation, to a \u221220 \u00b0C freezer. Within 7 days, swabs were transferred to \u221270 \u00b0C where they were stored until microbiological and virological analyses. Physical examinations, including ear examination by pneumatic otoscopy and anthropometric measurements of children and mothers, were performed and documented on a standardized data collection sheet.",

Longitudinal studies have demonstrated seasonal variations in the rate of pneumococcal colonization and rainy season has been identified as a significant risk factor for S. pneumoniae carriage in children and adults.16, 44, 49, 50 However, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae colonization observed in healthy E\u00f1epa children under 5 years of age in the previous study (69%) was similar to the rate we observed in healthy controls up to 5 years of age (70%). Another possible explanation for the high carriage rate in mothers in our study is the observation that in 81% of the S. pneumoniae positive mothers, pneumococci were only isolated from the oropharyngeal sample. In the previously performed study, oropharyngeal samples were not taken.48 The percentage of S. pneumoniae positive children in which S. pneumoniae was isolated from the oropharyngeal sample alone was lower (12%). The importance of oropharyngeal sampling for detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in children and mothers was previously demonstrated by Greenberg et al.22 However, in contrast to their findings, in our study no H. influenzae was isolated from the oropharyngeal sample alone. This might be due to the high number of children with ARTI in our study, as H. influenzae detection in the nasopharyngeal swab increased during illness in the study of Greenberg et al.22\n",

As we matched cases with sibling controls, we may underestimate the effect of factors related to residence and household exposure. An example of a factor related to residence that has been associated with ARTIs is exposure to biomass smoke.55, 59 Larger cross-sectional studies are needed to examine the associations between household-related factors and ARTI risk. Additionally, the magnitude of the associations between demographic and nutritional variables and S. pneumoniae colonization in our study may differ from the effect magnitude in the general population as our study population was not a representative sample of the general population of E\u00f1epa Amerindian children due to the case\u2013control study design. Finally, confidence intervals of the OR determined in multivariate analyses of factors associated with ARTI and S. pneumoniae colonization were wide due to the small sample size of our study. Rural areas are generally difficult to reach during the winter season due to heavy rain falls, limiting possibilities for field workers and researchers. The communities included in our study were very isolated communities that could be reached only after several hours of walking through an undulating forest-savanna area as heavy rains had flooded area roads. As most respiratory viruses circulate in the rainy season,60, 61 this is the preferred period for research focusing on the correlation of respiratory tract bacteria with viral infections.",
