The S1 subunit contains a N-terminal domain (NTD), a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that drives host cell tropism and a C-terminal domain further subdivided in domains SD1 and SD2, while the S2 subunit mainly consists of heptad repeat (HR) regions involved in membrane fusion (Belouzard et al 2012 , Liu et al 2004 , Li 2016 Fig. 1A-B) . Spike protein monomers can exist in two main metastable conformations: down, with the RBD tightly packed against the NTD, and up (Song et al 2018; Walls et al 2020; Wrapp et al 2020) . The up conformation represents the active form of the spike protein, corresponding to the receptor-accessible configuration (Berry et al 2004 , Pak et al 2009 , Walls et al 2017 , Wrapp et al 2020 . In the cryo-EM structure of the spike protein only one monomer is found in the up configuration and expected to contact the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Walls et al 2020 , mediating host cell invasion.",

One of the evolutionary innovations in SARS-CoV-2, which has been suggested to enhance its infectivity (Andersen et al 2020 , Coutard et al 2020 , is the presence in the spike of a novel and peculiar furin-like cleavage site (S1/S2) in the form of an exposed loop harbouring multiple arginine residues (PRRAR/S amino acid sequence cleaved at the '/' symbol; Walls et al 2020; Wrapp et al 2020; Fig. 1B-C) . This site has been observed, though with different amino acid sequences, in distantly related CoVs, like MERS-CoV and HKU1-CoV, but not in those viruses that are the most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (Coutard et al 2020 , Andersen et al 2020 , Xiao et al 2020 .",

Then, we show that the mutation of residue 614 has both short-and long-range effects on the dynamics of the spike protein, affecting both the S1/S2 furin-like cleavage site and the RBD spatial conformation. In particular, in the G614 variant, the multibasic furin-like domain is much more exposed than in the D614 variant, and the position of the cleavage residue R685 more strongly stabilized by the electrostatic interaction with D663, likely facilitating the recognition by the protease. In addition, in the G614 variant, the RBD assumes a more open conformation, which, we propose, may facilitate the interaction with ACE2. The general similarity of observed trends in the relative frequencies of the two alternative variants in the genomic samples and in the actual populations as reconstructed by coalescent-based inference suggest that the G614 molecular features that we identified are more likely boosting transmission rate rather than pathogenicity.

The rationale for this model structure is that territories serve as reasonable approximations of genetic drift units (demes) and that F ST between two populations can be seen as the correlation of randomly drawn alleles within each population relative to the total. Hence, we used in the model a correlation matrix based on pairwise F ST between populations to account for the shared drift among connected territories.

The structural and functional differences between the ancestral and derived variants of C14408T were not yet thoroughly investigated.",

Korber et al (2020) found no association between G614 and symptom severity in a group of patients from a single UK hospital. To generalize this result, supporting enhanced transmission rate over increased pathogenicity in the G614 spread, we used an independent coalescent-based approach to test for the actual dominance of the G614 in different populations (Australia, Belgium, England, Iceland, Netherlands, Spain, Wales, USA-WA, USA-NY, and USA-WI).",

Although the pattern is clear in all territories ( i.e., similar general trend in the genomic sample and in the population), in Iceland and Netherlands, the BSP reconstructions show a lower prevalence of the G variant in the population than in the hospitalized samples. We note again that Iceland is the only territory showing a clear decline in the relative frequency of G614 in the sample, which is also tracked by the BSP, but the case of Netherlands (one of the countries contributing the most to virus sequencing from the very beginning of the outbreak; GISAID Database) is more difficult to explain.

The two variants of the spike display clear differences in the amplitude of the conformational space sampled by the RBD in the up conformation along the first three eigenvectors (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3 ), together describing more than 50% of the total motion, whereas the essential dynamics is largely similar between the two variants for the chains with the RBD in down conformation (data not shown). In general, the motion of the whole S1 subdomain, including the RBD, is more spread in D614, while the same region in G614 has a more confined motion. However, the receptor-binding motif (RBM residues 435-506), the apical region of the RBD directly deputed to bind the ACE2 receptor, shows a larger movement, also allowing it to move far apart from the NTD, as evidenced by the increase in the distance between these two domains in G614 (Fig. 4B) .

Basically, a variation in the pairs distance is an index of low dynamical connection between the two residues in the pair. In D614 the dynamical connection between the NTD and the RBD is low (Fig. 4C, left panel, red rectangle) , as well as that between the RBD and the S2 domain (Fig. 4C, left panel, green rectangle) . On the contrary, the NTD-RBD connection becomes stronger in the G614 variant, once again evidencing that the two domains are dynamically and functionally more connected (Fig. 4C , right panel, red rectangle). In this case, a very strong connection also appears between the RBD and the S2 domain (Fig. 4C , right panel, green rectangle), highlighting a stronger functional inter-domains connection in the G614 variant.

The substitution in this position of an aspartic acid (D), carrying a negatively charged side chain, with a glycine (G) strongly affects the dynamics of the spike functional domains at a short-and long-range, making it sample novel structural conformations, responsible for the higher fitness of this SARS-Cov-2 variant. In particular, the long-range effect of the D614G substitution influences the internal dynamics of the RBD and its relative orientation, allowing it to acquire a more open conformation which is particularly suitable for the interaction with the host ACE2 receptor. Nevertheless, the stronger dynamical connection of the RBD with the S2 domain could allow to remove the steric restraints on helix linker 2, which would better trigger the release of the S1 subunits, allowing the extension of pre-fusion S2 helixes to form the postfusion S2 long helix bundle (Song et al 2018) .",

These two structural and dynamical features possibly favor the furin-like domain recognition by the protease and improve the efficiency of the proteolytic cleavage, a crucial step for host cell infection. However, what seems to be the evolutionary strength of the virus in terms of invasiveness can be transformed in its weakness, in the fight against COVID-19. Indeed, the peculiar properties of the furin-like domain, as the widening of the cavity, can be exploited to trigger the rational design of drug molecules able to bind it and compete for the interaction of the spike with the protease, thus specifically blocking the invasiveness of this highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant.",

The allele at genomic position 23,403 (G/A), corresponding to amino acid substitution D \u2192 G in residue 614 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, was the binomial response. The fixed effect was the sampling day. We included random intercepts and slopes for \"territories\" (countries, except for USA states and Chinese provinces) and a covariance structure represented by F ST values between viral samples from each pair of territories. Our model structure assumes that random slopes of sampling day within \"territories\" captures the random component of allele frequency change (drift) within each territory and that F ST values capture the relative amount of drift that is shared between pairs of territories (due to migration, i.e. exchange of viral lineages). We fitted the GLMM using the function fitme from R package \"spaMM\" v3.2.0 (Rousset & Ferdy, 2014) on data from territories with at least 30 sequences ( N territories = 24, N sequences = 5,773). F ST values were calculated using the function pairwise.fst ( R package \"hierfstat\" v0.04-22, Goudet, 2005) and including all sequences available for each territory.
