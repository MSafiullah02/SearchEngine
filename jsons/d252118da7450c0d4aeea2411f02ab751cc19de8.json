Over this period, the Regional Health System, Local Health Authorities (ATS: Agenzia di Tutela della Salute), the Lombardy Reference Virology laboratories, and the National Health Institute (ISS: Istituto Superiore della Sanit\u00e0) collaborated to introduce coordinated actions to limit the spread of the infection.

Overall, 346 deaths occurred in the region and the case fatality rates (CFRs) was highest in the older age groups (14% in the 75+ years). Over the periods we observed changes in the geographical distribution of the cases in the twelve Provinces of the Lombardy Region, with Lodi being the most affected province in Period 1 and the fourth in Period 3, after Bergamo, Brescia and Cremona which, respectively, accounted for 25%, 21% and 17% of the overall number of cases of the region.",

This is due to the delay in identification of cases and reporting. Data on laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases reported in Lombardy by March 8, 2020 were used to estimate the time between the onset of symptoms and the laboratory confirmation. We used maximum likelihood to fit a negative binomial distribution to the data. We found that the best-fitting distribution has mean 5.25 (SD: 0.085) and dispersion 1.57 (SD: 0.054), see Figure S3 . We assessed possible bias in the data due to delays between the time of confirmation of a case and the time when the patient record is inserted in the centralized database (i.e., the reporting date). To this aim, we compared the epidemic curves by symptom onset and by confirmation date in successive updates of the patient line list ( Figure S4 ). From these curves, we computed the delay by which each positive case and its symptom (when symptomatic) are reported in the current version of patient line list ( Figure S5 ), and we used maximum likelihood to fit to each of them a gamma distribution. The parameters of the bestfitting distributions are reported in Tab. S2. Figure S6 shows that both reporting delays declined over time suggesting a progressive improved reliability of the database as regards cases occurred soon before the update. Figure S7 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function of the delay from symptom onset to reporting and highlights the fact that there is a delay of about two weeks until we can assume 90% completeness of the data for the recorded cases with symptom onset at a given date.

By the following day 28 positive cases were identified in the same area. On February 23, given the upsurge of positive cases in the area, a Prime Minister Decree (DPCM Law 23/02/20 n.6) introduced strict measures aimed at containing the spread of the disease. The implemented measures included the lockdown of a number of municipalities that appeared at the center of the outbreak (Red Zone), the closure of schools of all grades and universities, and the suspension of public activities, sports events, and social gatherings across the Region.",

The delay between the dates of symptom onset and reporting was 7.3 days (95%CI, 1 to 20). Therefore, the dates of symptom onset provide a reliable picture of the situation up to about the end of February. Both delays showed a decline over time (see Supplementary Material).During the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, we observed the formation of three major clusters identified around the cities of Codogno, Bergamo, and Cremona (see Supplementary Material).

Overall, from February 21 to March 3, 7,925 nasal swabs were analyzed in Lombardy, with 2,251 positives for SARS-Cov-2. A deeper analysis was performed on the subset data from Pavia Reference Laboratory where 6,208 subjects were swabbed and 1,529 resulted positive. Out of 1,529 positive subjects, 422 (27.6%) were tested between February 21 and February 26, when both symptomatic patients and symptomatic/asymptomatic contacts were considered (the positivity rate was 14.6%, 422/2,892). In particular, among the 380 positive subjects detected on February 21, 17 (4.5%) were defined as asymptomatic, 295 (77.6%) were classified as symptomatic, and in 68 cases (17.8%) there was no clear indication on the presence of symptoms.

However, the limited number of asymptomatic infected subjects that were identified through contact tracing during the first week of data collection may suggest a minor role of asymptomatic individuals in overall spread of the infection. In contrast, active search of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in the initial phases of the outbreak drained significant resources somewhat limiting the timely identification of all infected individuals.It is important to note that this study is clearly affected by the usual limitations deriving from the data analysis of rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreaks. In such a situation the proper identification of the correct epidemiological links between cases is challenging. This increases the uncertainty surrounding our estimates of the serial interval. As time progressed, critical public health interventions were put in place affecting the quickness of data collection. This partially explains the large delay between the dates of symptom onset and reporting. Such an observed delay does not allow the analysis of the net reproduction number to be extended after February 25 (as the data after that date could be incomplete). The estimates of the net reproduction number are robust to an unknown level of underreporting, but would be affected by a time-varying reporting rate. This could be the case here, given the change in the testing protocol occurred on February 25.Asymptomatic transmission remains a challenge to prove and quantify, although we found virological evidence suggesting a similar viral load in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects.",

All of those are responsible for a rapid saturation of the health emergency system with a progressive difficulty of being able to treat both subjects with COVID-19 and those with other pathologies. Nonetheless, as shown by our analysis, the set-up of a quarantine area around the epicenter of the outbreak in Codogno, appears to have played a critical role in controlling the infection, inducing a reduction in the number of reported positive cases in the area and a consequent decrease in the estimate of the net reproductive number. This appeared as relatively robust evidence that helped informing the decision of enforcing other stringent measures to the entire Region. We expect that the impact of these measures may be more markedly visible in the next couple of weeks.In conclusion, even in the presence of all considered limitations, this analysis of the first two weeks of data provides important insights into the transmission dynamics of the infection, the virological characteristics of positive cases, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as the critical factors in the reporting system that need to be further considered.
