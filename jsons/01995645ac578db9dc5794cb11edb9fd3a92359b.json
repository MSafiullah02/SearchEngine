            "text": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain can come in the form of different modalities such as T1-weighted and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) which has been used to investigate a wide range of neurological disorders. Current state-of-the-art models for brain tissue segmentation and disease classification require multiple modalities for training and inference. However, the acquisition of all of these modalities are expensive, time-consuming, inconvenient and the required modalities are often not available. As a result, these datasets contain large amounts of unpaired data, where examples in the dataset do not contain all modalities. On the other hand, there is smaller fraction of examples that contain all modalities (paired data) and furthermore each modality is high dimensional when compared to number of datapoints. In this work, we develop a method to address these issues with semisupervised learning in translating between two neuroimaging modalities. Our proposed model, Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN (SSA-CGAN), uses an adversarial loss to learn from unpaired data points, cycle loss to enforce consistent reconstructions of the mappings and another adversarial loss to take advantage of paired data points. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework produces an improvement in reconstruction error and reduced variance for the pairwise translation of multiple modalities and is more robust to thermal noise when compared to existing methods.",

            "text": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain has been used to investigate a wide range of neurological disorders and depending on the imaging sequence used, can produce different modalities such as T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Each of these modalities produce different contrast and brightness of brain tissue that could reveal pathological abnormalities. Many of the advances in the use of data-driven models in Alzheimer's disease classification [17] , brain tumour segmentation [9] and skull stripping methods [18] , rely on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). In particular, datasets such as BraTs [23] and ISLES [19] have been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumours and stroke lesions respectively. These methods do not require the use of hand designed features and instead are able to learn a hierarchy of increasingly complex features. However, they require multiple neuroimaging modalities for high performance and improved sensitivity [4] (See Fig. 1 ). Collecting multiple modalities for each patient can be difficult, expensive and not all of these modalities are available in clinical settings. In particular, paired data, where an example has all modalities present, is difficult to access, making these data dependent models more difficult to train or reduce their applicability during inference.",

They use adversarial training which discriminates at the image level to guide the transformation between the domains. Furthermore, the translations between these two sets should have approximately invertible solutions and should be cycle consistentwhere the mapping of a particular source domain to the target domain and back should yield the original source at the pixel level.

On the other hand, there have been significant works that have tackled image-to-image translation in the unpaired setting. The CycleGAN [37] uses a cycle consistency loss to ensure the forward mapping and back results in the original image. It has demonstrated success in tasks where paired training data is limited e.g. in painting style and season transfer. The Dual GAN, being inspired by dual learning in machine translation used a similar loss objective, where the reconstruction error is used to measure the disparity between the reconstructed object and the original [36] . Unlike the previous two frameworks, the CoGAN [16] and cross-modal scene networks [1] does not use a cycle consistency loss but instead, uses weight sharing between the two GANs, corresponding to high level semantics to learn a common representation across domains.",

[34] investigated the difference between the CycleGan and UNIT [15] for the translation between T1 and T2 MRI modalities and found the CycleGAN was the better alternative if the aim was to generate visually realistic images as possible. McDermott et al. [22] on the other hand, tackled domain adaptation in the semi-supervised setting by proposing Wasserstein CycleGANs coupled with a l 2 regression loss function on paired data. The semi-supervised setting for this paper is similar to McDermott et al., however we propose an adversarial training signal for paired data instead of the l 2 loss. We demonstrate our method produces better reconstructions with lower variance and is more robust to noise in the context of translating between neuroimaging modalities compared to existing methods.

We also included in our experiments using the SSA-CGAN framework using only paired data, labelled SSA-CGANp.

We observe that the SSA-CGAN yields from a 8.32% reduction from the CycleGAN (T2 to T1) up to a 89.6% decrease in MSE in the case of CBF to CBV with an average reduction of 33.8% and 46.0% in MAE and MSE respectively across all transformations. The consistent out-performance of our method over the Cycle-GAN demonstrate there is potential gains when the information from paired data points can be leveraged. This is further emphasised by the improvement over SSA-CGAN-p which has been trained using only paired data. By leveraging unpaired data during training, the SSA-CGAN produces a reduction of 18.02% and 28.16% in MAE and MSE on average when compared to SSA-CGAN-p. SSA-CGAN produces a lower MSE in most cases despite CWRG includes a loss component that minimises the l 2 norm. Furthermore, SSA-CGAN produces lower variance compared to other methods demonstrating that our method is less sensitive to different weight intializations and improves the stability of training and convergence. 3 and 4 shows a comparison of the transformation from T2 to FLAIR and MTT to CBF respectively, of a particular chosen MR scan produced by the various models. The CycleGAN produces no noticeable change from the input image and the CWRG creates a smoothed version of the ground truth. This can be attributed to the MSE component of the objective function where the MSE pushes the generator to produce blurry images [21] . The additional adversarial component of our method forces the generator to synthesise a more visually realistic image. However, in Fig. 3 the image produced does not match the pixel intensity of the ground truth and in Fig. 4 , fails to capture the high detail and edges of the CBF modality and fails to distinguish between background and low intensity areas. The methods were assessed by injecting random Gaussian noise into the test data to simulate thermal noise conditions to evaluate the robustness of the models, despite not being trained on noisy examples. Various levels of noise was injected to the data, ranging from a standard deviation of 0.025 to 0.4. The predictions of the models was evaluated against the ground truth. Figure 5 shows the comparison between the models, with the MAE as the evaluation metric. At all noise levels, the SSA-CGAN outperforms other methods with lower variance further demonstrating the robustness of our method. The methods were also visually evaluated under extreme simulated thermal noise conditions by adding Gaussian noise with mean 0 standard deviation of 0.2 to the input. Figure 6 shows the transformation produced by a noisy input volume to the networks. The CWRG produces noise filtered version of the T2 scan and fails to perform the transformation to T1c. Our method and the CycleGAN shows robustness under the extreme scenario and fabricates successful slices. However, it fails to hide the tumour in the T2 scan (the bright spot in bottom right) in the T1c reconstruction and instead substitutes background for that tumour.",

However, examples where all modalities are available is limited and therefore the ability to incorporate unpaired data could be important for the adoption of these methods in clinical settings or improve existing models. Furthermore, the overall data available in limited and MRI volumes are high dimensional. The Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN (SSA-CGAN) learns translations between neuroimaging modalities using unpaired data and paired examples through a cycle-consistency loss, an adversarial signal for the discrimination between generated and real images of each domain and an additional adversarial signal that discriminates between the pairs of real data and pairs of generated images. Our experimental results have demonstrated that SSA-CGAN has superior results in achieving lower reconstruction error and is more robust compared to all of current stateof-the-art approaches across a wide range of modality translations.",

The CycleGAN produces no noticeable change from the input image and the CWRG creates a smoothed version of the ground truth. This can be attributed to the MSE component of the objective function where the MSE pushes the generator to produce blurry images [21]. The additional adversarial component of our method forces the generator to synthesise a more visually realistic image. However, in Fig. 3 the image produced does not match the pixel intensity of the ground truth and in Fig. 4, fails to capture the high detail and edges of the CBF modality and fails to distinguish between background and low intensity areas.",
