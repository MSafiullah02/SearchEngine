The presentations included low-grade fever (37.8\u201338.8\u00b0C), cough, and diarrhea; one patient was asymptomatic and was evaluated because of known exposures. Clinical symptoms, if present, began 8 hours to 12 days before admission. Chest computed tomography scans showed diffuse and patchy lung consolidation. Laboratory abnormalities, if present, included lymphopenia and mild transaminitis. No mother experienced clinical deterioration, and there were no delivery-related complications. All mothers recovered from COVID-19 infection. Amniotic fluid samples obtained at delivery (seven patients) were negative by PCR testing. Cesarean delivery was performed according to local guidelines to reduce the risk of vertical transmission and for logistic reasons.8 One woman delivered vaginally before the planned cesarean. All neonates were immediately isolated.",
