There are two general types of genetic DNA recombination in the cell: homologous recombination (general recombination) and nonhomologous recombination. Nonhomologous or site-specific recombination occurs relatively rarely and requires special proteins that recognize specific DNA sequences to promote recombination. Homologous recombination occurs between two DNA sequences that are the same or very similar in the region of crossovers. Homologous recombination probably occurs in every DNA-based organism and it happens much more often than nonhomologous recombination.",

Such recombination can be used for repairing damaged phage DNA and for exchanging DNA between related phages to increase their diversity. High-frequency illegitimate recombination was observed at the replication origin of bacteriophage M13 in the E. coli host. The crossovers occurred at the nucleotide adjacent to the nick at the replication origin, by joining to a nucleotide elsewhere in the genome.

In viruses that have a single-component DNA genome, recombination can involve the exchange of DNA fragments. In contrast, in segmented DNA viruses, in addition to exchanges within each DNA component, the genome segments can be reassorted. This has implications for the recombination behavior observed among mutants. Recombination analyses are most easily performed using conditional-lethal type. The cells are mixedly infected with two mutants at permissive conditions and then the nonpermissive conditions are applied to select for recombinants. The so called two-factor crosses are performed through simple pairwise infections. For single-segmented DNA viruses this approach allows the mutants to be ordered into complementation groups and the relative positions of mutations to be placed on a linear map. For segmented genome DNA viruses, however, due to the reassortant factors, the data obtained in two-factor crosses do not allow mutants to be ordered on to a linear map. Three-factor crosses involve the use of three mutations, with one of them being kept unselected during selection of recombinants between the other two. These crosses are useful for determining linkage relationships between mutants and for establishing the order of marker mutations. Due to reassortment the three-factor crosses are of less use in segmented viruses.",

The replication cycle of CaMV offers a variety of possibilities for recombination: recombination at the DNA level, which occurs in the nucleus, and at the RNA level, which occurs during reverse transcription in the cytoplasm. In general, it is difficult to decide by which recombination route a CaMV recombinant is obtained. However, such features as recombinational hot spots and apparent mismatch repair might be indicative. Namely, the presence of hot spots reflects replicative (RNA) recombination, while mismatch repair can occur during formation of heteroduplex intermediates and is thus indicative of DNA recombination. Recombination between CaMV strains and CaMV transgene mRNA was observed.

The terms of classic population biology do not describe RNA viruses. Instead, a term of quasispecies was proposed to reflect the nature of RNA virus populations. The processes of genetic recombination in plus-stranded RNA viruses probably do occur at the RNA level, as these viruses most likely do not go through DNA steps in their replication cycles. RNA recombination processes are generally categorized as either homologous or nonhomologous. In 1992, Lai postulated three classes of RNA recombination: homologous, aberrant homologous and nonhomologous. Homologous recombination occurs between two related RNA molecules at corresponding sites, although homologous RNA recombination can also occur within a common region shared by otherwise unrelated RNA sequences. Aberrant homologous recombination involves crossovers between related RNAs, but does not occur at corresponding sites, leading to sequence insertions or deletions. Nonhomologous recombination occurs between unrelated RNA molecules. Slightly different definitions, based on mechanistic models and considerations, were proposed recently by several authors.",

The mechanistic considerations suggest the nonprocessive nature of the coronavirus RNA polymerase, which might be responsible for recombination.\nSimilarly, RNA recombination in nodaviruses, two-partite RNA viruses, occurs between RNA segments at a site, where the nascent strand could form a base-paired region with the acceptor template. Such factors as template secondary structure and the similarity of the crossover sites to an origin of replication seem to influence the choice of recombination site. A model of recombination where the polymerase interacts directly with the acceptor nodavirus RNA was postulated.",

The exonuclease activity is inhibited at a chi site, the 3\u2032 end is no longer degraded and can thus invade another DNA molecule. (B) Synapse formation between two homologous DNAs by RecA protein. In steps 1 and 2, the RecA protein binds to the single-stranded end and forces it into an extended helical structure.

Then RuvB binds to RuvA, and the junction migrates, deriving energy from ATP cleavage. RuvC cleaves two strands of the Holliday junction to resolve the junction into separate DNA molecules.
