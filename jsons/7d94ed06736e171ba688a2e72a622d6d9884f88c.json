None of these associations, however, has been tested experimentally in humans, and only one (vitamin D deficiency) is presently amenable to experimental interventions. This chapter also summarizes the evidence, albeit more sparse and inconsistent, linking other environmental factors to MS risk.",

            "text": "MS is the most common neurologic disease in young adults. Incidence rates are low in childhood and adolescence (<6/100,000/year) high in the middle to late twenties and early thirties (11 to 18/100,000/year in high-risk populations), and gradually decline thereafter, with rates less than 9/100,000/year among those older than 45 years of age. 3, 6 Women are approximately twice as likely as men to develop MS, 7, 8 and the lifetime risk among white women is about 1 in 200. 3, 9 MS exhibits a worldwide latitude gradient, with high prevalence and incidence in Northern Europe, 7 Canada, 10,11 the northern United States, 3, 12, 13 and southern Australia 14 and decreasing prevalence and incidence in regions closer to the equator. 15 Exceptions to the latitude gradient exist and include a lower than expected prevalence in Japan 16 and higher than expected prevalence and incidence in the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Sicily. 7 Kurtzke 17 summarized the early descriptive studies by depicting areas of high (\u226530/100,000), medium (5 to 29/100,000), and low (<5/100,000) prevalence of MS; we have updated his figures with more recent prevalence estimates 7, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] (Fig. 4-1) . A more comprehensive review of MS incidence and prevalence worldwide was published in 2005. 18 It is important to note that differences in estimated incidence across countries or time periods can result from differences in study design, case ascertainment, or diagnostic criteria, rather than from real changes in disease occurrence. Differences in prevalence are even more difficult to interpret, because they may reflect increased survival or earlier diagnosis, both of which can occur even if the incidence is the same. 25 In spite of these limitations, the collective data do support a higher risk of MS at higher latitudes, both north and south of the equator.",

More recently, in a study conducted in the French West Indies (a low-risk area), an increased risk of MS was found among individuals who had moved to France (a high-risk area) and then returned to the West Indies. The increase in risk was greatest among those who migrated to France before the age of 15 years. 36",

In Canada, the female-to-male ratio apparently has increased from approximately 2:1 among individuals born in the 1930s and 1940s to approximately 3:1 among those born in the 1970s. 5 This change is strongly correlated with, and could be at least in part explained by, a sharp increase in the female-to-male ratio in smoking behavior (unpublished data), because smoking is a strong risk factor for MS (see later discussion).",

Among Vietnam and Gulf War veterans, however, this gradient was attenuated to less than twofold, and among nurses born between 1947 and 1964 it completely disappeared ( Fig. 4-3) . Because the methods used to determine rates of MS in the early and later cohorts were the same, and because the individuals in the cohorts had similar socioeconomic status 3 or access to health care, 4 this attenuation was unlikely to be due to artifact. A change of this magnitude over such a short period of time argues for an environmental, rather than a genetic, explanation of the latitude gradient; as discussed later, this environmental factor may involve changes in patterns of infection or sun exposure, or both. Further, the attenuation was probably caused by an increase in MS incidence in the southern United States, because incidence rates in the northern states, based at least on data from the longitudinal study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, seem to have remained relatively stable. 37 An attenuation of the latitude gradient in Europe has also been observed; however, no systematic studies have assessed this gradient within the same population over time, and the attenuation therefore may be due to improved study methodology and case ascertainment, particularly within the United Kingdom. 18",

            "text": "Later, numerous serologic studies were conducted, often demonstrating significantly elevated antibody titers against several viruses in MS patients compared with healthy controls, but these differences were probably an epiphenomenon of the immune activation rather than being of etiologic significance. 41 In part as a consequence of these investigations, many researchers became skeptical about the existence of an infectious agent causing MS, and this skepticism persists today. Epidemiologic clues to the hypothetical role of infection in MS are complex and often seem to point in opposite directions. On the one hand, results of family studies, including investigations of half-siblings, adopted children, and spouses of individuals with MS, support a strong genetic component as the leading explanation of MS clustering within families and provide little evidence of person-to-person transmission. 42 On the other, there are well-documented, albeit controversial, 43 reports of epidemics of MS, most notably in the Faroe Islands, 44 that are most easily explained by the introduction and transmission of an infectious agent. To reconcile these findings, it has been postulated that MS is a rare complication of a common infection, with the disease occurring in genetically or otherwise predisposed individuals. In this scenario, the epidemics would be a consequence of the introduction of the MS-causing agent for the first time in remote, previously na\u00efve populations. 45 Two hypotheses as to the nature of this infection have been proposed: (1) the responsible microorganism is more common in areas of high MS prevalence (the \"prevalence\" hypothesis), and (2) the MS-causing agent is ubiquitous and more easily transmitted in areas of low MS prevalence, where infection occurs predominantly in infancy, when it would be less harmful and more likely to confer protective immunity. The latter proposal is called the \"poliomyelitis\" hypothesis, by analogy with the epidemiology of poliomyelitis before vaccination. 46 The poliomyelitis hypothesis is also consistent with the higher prevalence of MS in communities with better hygiene, 47 in individuals with higher education, 48, 49 and in those with late age at infection with common viruses, 50 as well as the general lack of increase in MS incidence among individuals migrating from low-to high-prevalence areas. 27 However, the poliomyelitis hypothesis cannot explain the reduced risk of MS among migrants from high-to low-risk areas and, in fact, would predict an increase in MS risk in this circumstance, whereas the prevalence hypothesis is consistent with the observations. Failure to identify a specific microbe as the cause of MS, despite evidence that is consistent with some role for infection in at least modulating MS risk, has strengthened support for a third, more general, \"hygiene\" hypothesis, according to which exposure to multiple infections in childhood primes the immune responses later in life toward a less inflammatory and a less autoimmunogenic profile. 51 The hygiene hypothesis can explain all the features of MS epidemiology that are explained by the original formulation of the poliomyelitis hypothesis. In addition, the protective effect of migration from high-to low-MS areas, which is paradoxical under the poliomyelitis hypothesis, could be beneficial because of increased exposure of migrants to parasitic and other infections in the low-risk area. At the population level, prevalence of MS is positively correlated with high levels of hygiene, as measured, for example, by prevalence of intestinal parasites. 52 The improving hygienic conditions in southern Europe in the last few decades could explain the increased prevalence of MS reported in multiple surveys (although whether there was a true increase in MS incidence remains unsettled). 7 It is also interesting that infection with intestinal helminths, which is highly prevalent in developing countries, had been reported to cause an immune deviation with attenuation of helper T-cell 1 cellular immune responses and remission of MS. 53 Finally, the hygiene hypothesis provides a convincing explanation for the observations that infectious mononucleosis (IM) is associated with an increased risk of MS (relative risk [RR] = 2.3; P < .00000001) 54 and that the epidemiology of IM is strikingly similar to that of MS (Table 4 -1). 55 Because IM is common in individuals who are first infected with EBV in adolescence or adulthood 56 but rare when EBV infection occurs in childhood, it is a strong marker of age at EBV infection, which is itself strongly correlated with socioeconomic development across populations and with socioeconomic status within populations. 57 An exception to this pattern is seen in Asia, where EBV infection occurs uniformly early in life and IM is thus rare. It is noteworthy that the incidence of MS remains relatively low in Asian countries, including Japan, despite the fast industrialization and reduction of infectious diseases, 58 although there is evidence that the incidence may be increasing in Japan. 16 According to the hygiene hypothesis, the association between IM and MS risk does not reflect a causal effect of EBV but rather the indirect manifestation of a common cause; that is, both MS and IM are the result of high hygiene and a resulting low burden of infection during childhood. An important prediction of this hypothesis is that MS risk will be high among individuals reared in a highly hygienic environment, even if they do not happen to be infected with EBV later in life, whereas, if EBV has a causal role in MS, individuals who are not infected with EBV would have a low risk of MS. 59 The data on this point are unequivocal: individuals who are not infected with EBV, even though they have the same hygienic upbringing as those with IM, have an extremely low risk of MS (odds ratio [OR] from metaanalysis = 0.06; P < .00000001) ( Table 4 -2). The contrast could not be sharper or more consistent: MS risk among individuals who are not infected with EBV is at least 10-fold lower than that of individuals who are EBV-positive, and 20-fold lower than that of individuals with a history of IM. 59 Because studies in pediatric MS 60,61 rule out a common genetic resistance to MS and EBV infection, 59 we can conclude either that EBV itself or some other factor closely related to EBV is a strong causal risk factor for MS or that MS itself strongly predisposes to EBV infection.",

The association between EBV infection and MS is strong and consistent across multiple studies in different populations, and there is to some extent a biologic gradient (higher risk associated with severity of infection, as indicated by history of IM). Until recently, all studies on MS and infection used a cross-sectional design and could not completely rule out the possibility that EBV infection was a consequence rather than a cause of MS. However, the results of four longitudinal serologic studies have now been published (Table 4-3) . [62] [63] [64] [65] The most consistent finding across these studies is that, among individuals who will develop MS, there is an elevation of serum antibodies against the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) that precedes the onset of MS symptoms by many years. The presence of anti-EBNA1 antibodies is a marker of past infection with EBV, because titers typically rise only weeks after the acute infection. Further, there is no evidence in clinical studies of acute primary EBV infection in individuals with MS. 66 Taken together, these results indicate that MS is a consequence rather than a cause of EBV infection.",

The leading hypothesis was that the immune response to EBV infection in genetically susceptible individuals cross-reacts with myelin antigens (molecular mimicry). The discovery that MS patients have an increased frequency and broadened specificity of CD4-positive T cells recognizing EBNA1 69 and the identification of two EBV peptides (one of which is from EBNA1) as targets of the immune response in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients 70 provided support to the molecular mimicry theory. Other proposed hypotheses included the activation of superantigens, 71 an increased expression of alpha B-crystallin, 72 and infection of autoreactive B lymphocytes. 73 However, in a recent, rigorous pathologic study, 74 large numbers of EBVinfected B cells were found in the brain of most of MS patients. These cells were more numerous in areas with active inflammatory infiltrates, where cytotoxic CD8-positive T cells displaying an activated phenotype were seen contiguous to the EBV-infected cells. Alone, these pathologic findings provide only suggestive evidence for a causal role of EBV in MS, because the infiltration of EBV-infected B cells could be secondary to the inflammatory process that is the hallmark of MS, but their convergence with the epidemiologic evidence described earlier 59 is so striking that noncausal explanations become improbable. However, independent replication of these findings is needed before any conclusion can be drawn. The strong increase in MS risk after EBV infection and (if confirmed) the presence of EBV in MS lesions suggest that antiviral drugs or a vaccine against EBV could contribute to MS treatment and prevention. Although antiviral drugs have been tried in the past for MS treatment with borderline results, 75-77 none of the treatment regimens used was sufficiently effective against latent EBV infection.",

[92] [93] [94] Because exposure to sunlight is for most people the major source of vitamin D, 95 average levels of vitamin D also display a strong latitude gradient. Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation (290 to 320 nm) converts cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D 3 . Previtamin D 3 spontaneously isomerizes to vitamin D 3 , which is then hydroxylated to 25(OH)D 3 (25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 ), the main circulating form of the vitamin, and then to 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 ), the biologically active hormone. 95 However, during the winter months at latitudes greater than 42\u00b0 N (e.g., Boston, MA), even prolonged sun exposure is insufficient to generate vitamin D, 96 and levels decline. 97, 98 Use of supplements or high consumption of fatty fish (a good source of vitamin D) or vitamin D-fortified foods (mostly milk in the United States) may partially compensate for this decline, but few people consume large enough amounts of vitamin D, and seasonal deficiency is common. A link between vitamin D deficiency and MS was proposed more than 30 years ago as a possible explanation of the latitude gradient and of the lower prevalence of MS in fishing communities with high levels of fish intake 99 ; however, the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D were not known, and the hypothesis did not generate much interest at the time. After the discovery that the vitamin D receptor is expressed in several cells in the immune system and is a potent immunomodulator, 100 a series of experiments revealed a protective role of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 in several autoimmune conditions and in transplant rejection. 100 The effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, were particularly striking: injection of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 was found to completely prevent the clinical and pathologic signs of disease, 101,102 whereas vitamin D deficiency accelerated the disease onset. 102, 103 With vitamin D deficiency becoming a biologically plausible risk factor for MS, several epidemiologic studies were conducted to determine whether exposure to sunlight or vitamin D intake is associated with MS risk.

            "text": "The strongest evidence relating vitamin D levels to MS risk has been provided by two longitudinal studies, one based on assessment of dietary vitamin D intake, and one on serum levels of 25(OH)D. The relation between vitamin D intake and MS risk was studied in more than 200,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II cohorts. 111 Dietary vitamin D intake was assessed from comprehensive and previously validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 years during the follow-up of the cohorts. 112, 113 Total vitamin D intake at baseline was inversely associated with risk of MS: the age-adjusted pooled relative risk (RR) comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of consumption was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 1.12; P for trend = .03). Intake of 400 IU/day of vitamin D from supplements only was associated with a 40% lower risk of MS. These RRs did not materially change after further adjustment for pack-years of smoking and latitude at birth. Confounding by other micronutrients cannot be excluded, but adjustments for them in the analyses did not change the results. Because dietary vitamin D is only one component contributing to total vitamin D status (the other being sun exposure), a determination of whether serum levels of vitamin D are associated with MS risk in healthy individuals would strengthen the evidence in favor of a causal role for vitamin D. The serum level of 25(OH)D is a marker of vitamin D status and bioavailability; therefore, if vitamin D is protective, high serum levels of 25(OH)D would be expected to predict a lower risk of MS in healthy individuals. This question was recently addressed in a collaborative, prospective case-control study using the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR). 114 The study included 257 military personnel with confirmed MS and at least two serum samples collected before the onset of MS symptoms. Risk of MS was 51% lower among white individuals with 25(OH)D levels of 100 nmol/L or higher, compared with those levels lower than 75 nmol/L, and the reduction in MS risk associated with 25(OH)D levels \ufffd 100 nmol/L compared with those levels < 100nmol/L was considerably stronger before the age of 20 years (16 to 19 years) than at ages 20 or older.",

The results of migration studies suggest that more pronounced changes in MS risk are likely to occur among individuals who migrate in childhood. The age of 15 years, chosen as an arbitrary cutoff point in early studies, is usually quoted in the literature, but the reality is that data are insufficient to identify a meaningful threshold above which migration would not alter MS risk, 27 and in at least one study a reduction in risk was also observed among individuals who migrated as adults. 115 The results of the casecontrol study in Tasmania suggest that exposure to sunlight is mostly protective in childhood. 108 Further, vitamin D exposure in utero has been proposed as a possible explanation for the peak in MS incidence among individuals born in May (whose mothers were not pregnant during the summer, when UV light levels are higher) and the dip among those born in November, according to recent data from Canada and Sweden. 116 On the other hand, the results of the longitudinal studies support a protective effect of vitamin D also later in life. Both the lower risk of MS among women taking vitamin D supplements 111 and the lower risk among men and women with higher levels of 25(OH)D 114 would be difficult to explain by a protective effect of vitamin D solely in utero or during childhood. Therefore, it seems likely that, if vitamin D effectively protects against MS, levels during early adult life are also important.",

However, the public health implications of a possible causal association are enormous. If vitamin D reduces the risk of MS, supplementation in adolescents and young adults could be used effectively for prevention. Based on studies among individuals with low sun exposure, supplements providing between 1000 and 4000 IU/day of vitamin D would increase serum 25(OH)D to the optimal levels. [117] [118] [119] [120] There is an urgent need to conduct further longitudinal studies, preferably in a large, randomized controlled clinical trial assessing whether vitamin D supplementation in the general population prevents MS. The trial would have to be very large, because MS is a rare disease, but the sample size could be reduced by oversampling individuals who are at high risk, such as those with first-degree relatives who have MS. Alternative study designs might include national or multinational studies based on randomization of school districts or other suitable units.",

A cross-sectional survey of the general population in Hordaland County, Norway, found an increased risk of MS in ever-smokers compared with never-smokers (RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9). 125 Four prospective studies on smoking and MS have been conducted. Among 17,000 British women in the Oxford Family Planning Association Study, those who smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day were compared with never-smokers and had an 80% increased risk of MS (RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.6). 126 A total of 46,000 women from across the United Kingdom were enrolled in the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study, which found that women smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day had a 40% increased risk of MS (RR = 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 2.2), compared with never-smokers. 127 The Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II cohorts included more than 200,000 U.S. women; those who smoked 25 or more pack-years had a 70% increased risk (RR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.4; P < .01) compared with never-smokers. 128 In a prospective case-control study in the General Practice Research Database, which included both men and women, ever-smokers had a 30% increased risk of MS, compared with never-smokers (RR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.7). 129 The suggestion of an increased risk of MS among smokers was consistent across all four studies, and pooled estimates of the relative risk were highly statistically significant when never-smokers were compared with past and current smokers (Fig. 4 -4A) or with moderate and heavy smokers (see Fig. 4 -4B). Additional support for a role of smoking includes a twofold increase in risk of pediatric MS among children exposed to parental smoking 130 and an increased risk of transition to secondary progressive MS among individuals with relapsing-remitting MS 129 ; however, the latter finding was not confirmed in a recent investigation. 131 Biologic mechanisms for smoking and increased risk of MS could be neurotoxic, 132 immunomodulatory, 133, 134 or vascular (i.e., increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier), or they could involve increased frequency and duration of respiratory infections, 135 which may then contribute to increased MS risk. Smoking also appears to increase the risk of other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] and systemic lupus erythematosus, 141 arguing for a more general effect of cigarette smoking on autoimmunity.",

Retrospective case-control studies are also prone to bias due to both control selection and differential recall. The latter effect is particularly problematic, because even a modest difference in diet recall between cases and controls can cause a large bias in relative risk estimates. 152 This problem is compounded in MS by changes in diet that may occur in the early clinical or preclinical phases of the disease. Therefore, although these studies have been important in drawing attention to several aspects of diet as potentially important risk factors for MS, their results, whether in favor or against an hypothetical association, should be interpreted extremely cautiously. Understanding of the relation between diet and MS will require the conduct of large longitudinal investigations, with repeated assessment of diet using rigorous and validated methods and possibly measurements of biomarkers of nutrient intakes. So far, the only prospective studies of diet and MS were those conducted among women in the two Nurses' Health Study cohorts. In this population, neither animal fat nor saturated fat was associated with MS risk, but there was a suggestion of an inverse association with intake of the n-3 polyunsaturated fat linolenic acid. 153 There were also no significant associations between intakes of dairy products, fish, meat, 153 vitamins C or E, carotenoids, or fruits and vegetables and MS risk. 154 However, participants in these studies were already 25 to 55 years of age at time of recruitment, and therefore they shed little light on the possible effect of diet earlier in life and MS risk.",

Studies in the United States conducted among subjects included in a health care database, 165 among nurses, 166 and among participants in three health maintenance organizations 167 found no association between hepatitis B vaccination and risk of MS. Further, in studies of children and adolescents, no association was found between hepatitis B vaccination and MS risk 168 or risk of conversion to MS among children with a first demyelinating event. 170 However, a case-control study conducted in the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom did find a threefold increased risk associated with receipt of the vaccine within 3 years before MS onset, 170 and a French case-control study reported a nonsignificant increased risk of MS among individuals with clinically isolated syndrome after vaccination. 171 Among individuals with MS, the vaccine does not appear to increase the risk of relapses. 172 Overall, there is no convincing evidence that hepatitis B vaccination increases MS risk.",
