            "text": "# equal contribution % equal contribution ABSTRACT Tenacious mucus produced by tracheal and bronchial submucosal glands is a defining feature of cystic fibrosis (CF). Although airway acidification occurs early in CF, whether transient acidification is sufficient to initiate mucus abnormalities is unknown. We studied mucus secretion and mucus transport in piglets forty-eight hours following an intra-airway acid challenge. Acid-challenged piglet airways were distinguished by increased mucin 5B (MUC5B) in the submucosal gland but decreased lung lavage fluid MUC5B, following in vivo cholinergic stimulation, suggesting a failure in submucosal gland secretion. Concomitantly, intrapulmonary airways were obstructed with glycoprotein rich material under both basal and methacholinestimulated conditions. To mimic a CF-like environment, we also studied mucus secretion and transport under diminished bicarbonate and chloride transport conditions ex vivo. Cholinergic stimulation in acid-challenged piglet airways induced extensive mucus films, greater mucus strand formation, increased dilation of submucosal gland duct openings and decreased mucociliary transport. Finally, to elucidate potential mediators of acid-induced mucus defects, we investigated diminazene aceturate, a small molecule that inhibits the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC). Diminazene aceturate restored surface MUC5B in acid-challenged piglet airways under basal conditions, mitigated acid-induced airway obstruction, and magnified the number of dilated submucosal gland duct openings. These findings suggest that even transient airway acidification early in life might have profound impacts on mucus secretion and transport properties. Further they highlight diminazene aceturate as an agent that might be beneficial in alleviating certain mucus defects in CF airway disease.",

For example, pathologic findings in neonates with CF described bronchioles obstruction due to \"thick\" mucus produced by the tracheal and bronchial submucosal glands (5) . Similarly, Hoegger and colleagues found a failure of mucus detachment from airway submucosal glands in newborn pigs with CF, resulting in impaired mucociliary transport (6) . Likewise, rats with CF displayed submucosal gland duct plugging prior to onset of airway infection (7) , whereas ferrets with CF showed excessive mucus accumulation even in a sterile airway environment (8) . Combined, these studies highlight the submucosal gland as a key node in CF pathogenesis (9) , and suggest that abnormal mucus might precede infection and inflammation. Consistent with this, a recent study in preschool children with CF suggested that mucus accumulates in the airways prior to infection and airway remodeling (10) .",

Numerous mechanisms have been proposed, including dehydration of the airway (12) (13) (14) (15) ) and a lack of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate transport (16) , which acidifies the airway surface (17, 18) . Both hypotheses are attractive. The lack of bicarbonate transport and an acidic airway pH hypothesis has received scrutiny as studies describing acidification find that it occurs early in disease. For example, decreased airway pH has been found in CF pigs (18) and CF rats (7) prior to the onset of infection and inflammation, whereas in humans, decreased airway surface pH has been described in neonates with CF (19) , but not children (20, 21) .",

In our studies, we found a marginal effect of diminazene aceturate in preventing acid-induced mucus defects in the trachea, whereas a strong protective effect of diminazene aceturate was observed in the intrapulmonary airways. It is possible that ASIC1a is more concentrated in the small airways compared to the large airways. It is also possible that ASIC1a is expressed on additional cell types in the small airways compared to the large airways, thus amplifying its protective effect. Further, the degree of acidification might be airway tree-dependent, and thus other sensors in addition to ASIC1a more critical in the larger airways. Surprisingly, we also found that diminazene aceturate magnified the number of submucosal gland duct openings under diminished bicarbonate and chloride transport conditions. However, this was not associated with a greater number of mucus strands, nor a further impairment (or alleviation) of mucus transport defects. Thus, the significance of augmented submucosal gland duct openings induced by diminazene aceturate is unknown and requires additional studies.",

Subjects were male and female piglets. Data were collected across 15 separate experiments in a controlled laboratory experimental design. Sexes and treatments were balanced within an experiment whenever possible. Male and female piglets were assigned to treatment randomly. Studies were performed by individuals blinded to treatment; only an animal ID was associated with post-mortem samples. Our previous work for histological scoring indicated a \"n\" of 8 per sex was required to achieve statistical significance (22, 35) . We observed no sex differences in airway obstruction induced by acid and therefore combined male and female data. Similarly, for qRT-PCR experiments, our previous data indicated that a \"n\" of 5 was required (35), therefore we planned for one additional animal per group per sex. For animals that received methacholine in vivo, we performed a smaller study on saline and acid-challenged animals prior to investigating the effects of diminazene aceturate (n = 3 saline-challenged, 3 acid-challenged). For ELISA analysis, we previously reported a n of 6 was required (22) . Prospective exclusion criteria established included any piglet that required antibiotics or anti-inflammatories due to gastrointestinal illness. Data were not assessed for outliers.",

Briefly, 3-4 rings of trachea were removed post-mortem and the outside of the tracheas were wrapped in gauze soaked with 5 mls of the following: 135 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM K2HPO4, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dextrose, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH), 1.5 mgs per ml of methacholine, and 100 \u03bcM bumetanide. We determined that the amount of methacholine the tissue was exposed to was 0.15 mgs total (e.g., external surface of the trachea is covered by approximately100 \u03bcl). Thus, the methacholine dose delivered to the trachea was 0.15mg/4.71cm 2 (tissue dimensions of trachea: radius = 0.5 cm, height = 1.5 cm). Using a conversion chart for dogs (41) , we estimated the body surface area of a 2-3 kg piglet to be 0.16-0.21 m 2 . Therefore, the estimated dose of methacholine delivered to the tissue was ~6-7 fold higher than the cumulative in vivo dose of methacholine to account for diffusion of methacholine across multiple tissues layers and in the absence of blood circulation. Tracheas were then placed in a temperature-controlled humidified incubator for 3 hours. Following stimulation, tracheas were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 30 minutes using a triton solution (0.15%), followed by blocking in SuperBlock PBS. Jacalin-FITC and wheat-germ agglutin-rhodamine were used to visual mucus (26, 42) and incubated overnight with tracheas at concentration of 1:1,000. Tracheas were then washed, cut upon the posterior surface, and pinned to wax covered petri-dishes followed by submersion in PBS. Tracheas were imaged with Zeiss Axio Zoom V16 posterior to anterior using identical microscope settings. Images were assigned scoring indices for sheet formation and strand formation by two observers blinded to conditions. The number of dilated submucosal gland ducts was also measured by two observers blinded to conditions. Scoring for sheet formation follows: 1 = no sheet formation; 2 = 1-25% of image field shows sheet formation; 3 = 26-50% of image field shows sheet formation; 4 = 51-75% of image field shows sheet formation; 5 = 76-100% of image field shows sheet formation. Sheet formation was defined as the loss of discrete cellular packets of mucus. Secondary analysis and validation of scoring was performed with Imaris software (detailed below). Scoring for strand formation was similar to sheet formation. Scoring for strand formation follows: 1 = no strand formation; 2 = 1-25% of image field shows 3 = 26-50% of image field shows a strand; 4 = 51-75% of image field shows a strand; 5 = 76-100% of image field shows a strand. Secondary analysis consisting of tracing the strand area and expressing it a percentage of the total image field of view was also performed on a subset of images in ImageJ.",

The number of particles (representing the jacalin-labeled mucus with intensity above background) were reported. In tracheas that exhibit robust mucus sheet formation, the number of computer-assigned particles is decreased because of the significant jacalin labeled mucus that covers the field of view (e.g., less signal to noise), as opposed to the tracheas in which there is discreet packets of jacalin-labeled mucus (e.g., greater signal to noise).",
