In order to obtain at least a rough estimate of more recent vaccination rates, clinicians in our hospital randomly asked parents of 100 paediatric inpatients older than 12 months and younger than 18 years (hospitalized for any reason except for influenza), whether their children were vaccinated against influenza, and, for comparison, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).

One hundred forty-five patients (89%) were positively diagnosed via rapid antigen test, 17 (10%) via PCR and 4 patients (1%) via both of these tests. We were able to reach parents of 125 inpatients (75%) for a query about vaccination against influenza. Only one of these 125 patients had been vaccinated against influenza in the season 2017/18. Reasons for hospital admission included high fever (32%), dyspnea (19%), febrile seizure (12%), dehydration (10%) and diarrhea or vomiting (9%). Rare reasons included sepsis, suspected meningitis, myocarditis, myositis, hematemesis, reaction to oseltamivir, and reduced general condition. 23 (15%) inpatients had an underlying chronic condition including 8 patients with developmental delay. Nine children (5.4% of all inpatients) needed intensive care treatment including one child who died from acute necrotizing encephalitis and three patients who had chronic conditions, in particular chronic kidney disease, De-Morsier-Syndrome and spastic quadriplegia. Two patients needed invasive ventilation for a total of nine and ten days, and two patients needed non-invasive ventilation (Optiflow\u2122 | Fisher & Paykel Healthcare).\n\n",

Therefore, a direct comparison of differences between 2002 and 2016 and season 2017/18 might be exaggerated.
