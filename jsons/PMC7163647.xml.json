Abbreviations: CoV, coronavirus; ICU, intensive care unit; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction \n*Currently, there is no a standardized therapeutic recommendation. Lopinavir/ritonavir is available in several hospitals and has shown promising results in pre\u2010clinical models and case series of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infections,14, 15 although no high\u2010level evidence of efficacy and safety is currently available for its use either as monotherapy or in combination with interferons or other drugs (a randomized controlled trial has been initiated in patients with 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia in China).6 Conflicting results have been reported in previous experiences of using ribavirin for severe pulmonary infections caused by coronaviruses, whereas promising pre\u2010clinical models exist for remdesivir and for IFN\u03b21b.3, 14, 15 Drugs approved for other indications such as loperamide, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, cyclosporin A and mycophenolic acid have shown activity against coronavirus in vitro, but their role in the therapy of the human disease remains debatable (also in view of the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporin A and mycophenolic acid).14, 15 Although again in the absence of high\u2010level evidence, the use of plasma from convalescent patients could be considered following previous experiences in MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected subjects,15 preferably after dedicated investigation in 2019\u2010nCoV patients",
