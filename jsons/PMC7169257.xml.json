Following insulinoma and adrenocortical neoplasia, it is the third most common neoplasia of domestic ferrets overall.1, 2, 3, 4 In ferrets, lymphoma can be classified based on tissue involvement, including multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and extranodal.1, 2, 3 The presentation and organ distribution of lymphoma has been associated with the age of onset.5, 6 Mediastinal lymphoma is more prevalent in young ferrets, particularly less than 1 year of age. These ferrets tend to have an acute presentation and may present with dyspnea. Ferrets with mediastinal lymphoma may also have multicentric involvement.2, 5, 6 Ferrets 3 years of age and greater have a variable presentation with multicentric disease being more prevalent. Clinical signs in older ferrets may be chronic and nonspecific depending on organ involvement. Some ferrets may have intermittent signs over several months, while others may be asymptomatic with lymphoma being diagnosed incidentally, detected either during routine physical examination or during evaluation of comorbidities.1, 2, 3\n",

Lymphoma was diagnosed from ultrasound\u2010guided aspirates, surgical biopsies, and/or necropsy; three ferrets had two diagnostic procedures performed. Ultrasound\u2010guided aspirate cytology was performed in nine ferrets, surgical biopsy in three, and necropsy in five. Both aspirates and biopsy were performed in two ferrets, and both aspirates and necropsy in one ferret. One ferret in this study was previously described.8 The median age at the time of lymphoma diagnosis was 5.2 years (range 3.25\u20137.6 years). Eight of the ferrets were neutered males, and six were spayed females. Prior disease histories included adrenal disease (n = 5), cardiovascular disease (5), cutaneous mast cell tumors (4), diarrhea (3), insulinoma (2), cataracts (2), and one each of granulomatous lymphadenitis secondary to mycobacteriosis, renal insufficiency, and a chronic pelvic limb abscess. Cardiovascular disease included second degree atrioventricular block (3), systemic hypertension (1), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (1), and in one individual both aortic insufficiency and arteriosclerosis. For most ferrets, the time between the first imaging study and a diagnosis of lymphoma was 1 day or less (12/14). In one ferret each, the time between the initial imaging study and final diagnosis of lymphoma was 7 days and 6.9 months. The duration of clinical signs prior to reaching the diagnosis of lymphoma ranged from less than 1 day to 8 months with a mode of less than 1 day and a median of 6 days. Clinical signs include lethargy (n = 9), diarrhea (8), inappetence (7), weight loss (6), ataxia (4), lameness (1), and vomiting (1). Diarrhea was chronic in three ferrets and consistent with melena in two. Two ferrets did not have overt clinical signs.",

Contrast was manually injected through an IV catheter preplaced in a cephalic vein. One ferret underwent MRI evaluation of the lumbar and sacral spine. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 1.5 T MRI unit (GE Medical System, Milwaukee, WI) with the patient in dorsal recumbency under general anesthesia. Image sequences included T2 weighted (T2w) image series in a sagittal and transverse plane, T2w fat\u2010saturated images in a sagittal and transverse plane, and a sagittal single\u2010shot fast spine echo. Additional sequences including T1 weighted (T1w) images and administration of gadolinium were not performed due to anesthetic concerns for the patient.",

Decreased abdominal serosal detail was present in 10 of the 12 ferrets with radiographs. This was interpreted to be potentially due to a poor body condition in two ferrets. Abdominal serosal detail was additionally mottled in seven ferrets. Sonographically, peritoneal effusion was detected in 11/13 ferrets, and was considered mild in 7, moderate in 4, anechoic in 8, and echogenic in 3. The spleen was considered enlarged in 7 out of 12 ferrets radiographically and in 8 out of 13 ferrets in which abdominal ultrasonography was performed. The remaining five ferrets were considered to have \u201cincidental splenomegaly\u201d on ultrasound and were radiographically considered normal (n = 4) and enlarged (1). Of the eight spleens sonographically considered abnormal, multifocal hypoechoic splenic nodules were present in six ferrets (Fig. 1); one of these six ferrets was considered to have a radiographically normal spleen. An isoechoic to hypoechoic mass with central hypoechoic nodules was present in one ferret. The spleen had a mottled echotexture in one ferret. Three ferrets were sedated with butorphanol (Torbugesic, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and midazolam (Hospira Inc., Lake Forrest, IL) prior to abdominal ultrasonography; sedation was not performed in any ferret prior to radiographs. All three sedated ferrets had enlarged spleens with one spleen having a mottled echotexture and the other two spleens having multifocal hypoechoic nodules. Splenic cytology or histopathology was not performed in any of the ferrets that received sedation for ultrasound. Cytology or histopathology was available in seven ferrets\u2014aspirates were performed in 2/7, necropsy in 4/7, and both aspirates and necropsy in 1/7.

The other seven ferrets did not have cytologic evaluation of the spleen.

One of these ferrets had a large cranial abdominal mass, which was subsequently confirmed to be a markedly enlarged pancreatic lymph node. One ferret had splenic lymphadenopathy detected on the radiographs retrospectively after evaluation of the sonographic findings. Lymphadenopathy was reported in 11 of the 13 ferrets with abdominal ultrasonography and the one ferret in which whole body CT was performed. Sonographically, abnormal lymph nodes were hypoechoic, rounded, variably enlarged, and surrounded by a hyperechoic rim (Fig. 3). Some lymph nodes had patchy hyperechoic regions within or a reticular, nodular appearance. Abdominal lymph nodes involved included the mesenteric (n = 10), hepatic (7), sublumbar (5), splenic (4), gastric (3), gastroduodenal (3), colonic (3), pancreatic (2), ileocolic (1), renal (1), and inguinal (1) lymph nodes. In one ferret other lymph nodes were reported to be involved in addition to the mesenteric and sublumbar nodes, but were not specifically identified. Nine of the 11 ferrets with abdominal ultrasound and the one ferret with CT had involvement of 2 or more lymph nodes reported; 2/11 ferrets had only one reportedly abnormal lymph node (1 splenic lymph node, 1 mesenteric lymph node).

At necropsy, intramedullary lymphoma was found in the L1 vertebra with epidural extension of the tumor. Lymphoma was also found affecting the spleen, liver, pancreas, and mesenteric lymph nodes. In the second ferret with vertebral lysis, there was geographic lysis of the cranial two\u2010thirds of the body and pedicles of T14. There was also possible lysis of the cranial body and pedicles of L4. The dorsal half of the left 9th rib was lytic and no longer visible. Associated with this rib, there was a large, ill\u2010defined, soft\u2010tissue mass, which extended into the thoracic cavity. The adjacent ribs and vertebra were not appreciably involved. Additional radiographic findings in this ferret included splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and abdominal masses consistent with enlarged lymph nodes. With CT, expansile lysis of the left T14 vertebral body and pedicle was seen associated with a hyperattenuating (to muscle), strongly enhancing mass (Fig. 7). The mass occupied the ventral two\u2010thirds of the spinal canal and resulted in severe spinal cord compression. A possible pathologic fracture was present in the cranial endplate. At L4, there was lysis of the left pedicle and body associated with a mildly compressive, hyperattenuating, contrast\u2010enhancing mass. An additional, similar mass lesion was seen at T4, with lysis of the midvertebral body and mild spinal cord compression. The rib mass was isoattenuating (to muscle), heterogeneous, mildly enhancing, and resulted in severe, expansile lysis. Cytology of the rib mass obtained by ultrasound\u2010guided fine\u2010needle aspiration was diagnostic for lymphoma; cytological assessment of the other lesions was not performed in this ferret.",

This is consistent with prior reports in which multicentric lymphoma is the most common presentation in ferrets older than 3 years of age.1, 5, 6, 12 The most common imaging findings in this study were intra\u2010abdominal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate peritoneal effusion. Lymphadenopathy consisted of multiple enlarged, predominantly intra\u2010abdominal lymph nodes, particularly including the mesenteric lymph node. Only one ferret had peripheral lymphadenopathy, consisting of enlargement of the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes, in addition to abdominal lymphadenopathy. Lymph nodes greater than 6.2 mm thick sonographically were generally appreciable radiographically as round to oblong, soft\u2010tissue nodules or masses in their respective locations. Of the three ferrets in which sonographically detected lymphadenopathy was not appreciable radiographically, only one had a lymph node thickness greater than 6.2 mm. That ferret also had a large, retroperitoneal mass that likely accounted for a lack of visualization of the enlarged mesenteric lymph node due to silhouetting and displacement. Previous studies in normal ferrets using ultrasound have reported the normal thickness of mesenteric lymph nodes as 5.3 \u00b1 1.39 mm and 7.6 \u00b1 2.0 mm.13, 14 Given that some radiographically visible lymph nodes measured as small as 6.2 mm (which is within the reported normal ranges for mesenteric lymph nodes) it is possible that normal lymph nodes may be radiographically appreciable. In the authors\u2019 experiences, however, visualization of normal, small abdominal lymph nodes on radiographs of ferrets is uncommon. Normal abdominal lymph nodes are not radiographically distinguishable in dogs and cats.15, 16 Although some lymph nodes in this study that were considered abnormal measured within the reported normal ranges, there were other changes to those nodes to suggest pathology, such as hypoechogenicity. In dogs and cats, sonographic changes that have been associated with malignancy include an increase in maximal short and long axis diameter (enlarged), an increase in short\u2010to\u2010long axis length ratio (more rounded appearance), hypoechogenicity, hyperechoic perinodal fat with an irregular nodal contour, and heterogeneity.17, 18, 19\n",

Grossly the normal spleen has been reported to measure 5.1 cm in length, 1.8 cm in width, and 0.8 cm thick.20 Given that these are gross measurements, however, they were likely obtained postmortem. Splenic size is variable and decreases postmortem, so these measurements may not be translatable to antemortem studies with sonographic measurements.21 The smallest splenic thickness in this study was 0.8 cm; using the gross measurement guidelines all spleens in this study would be considered enlarged. The degree of splenomegaly was therefore subjectively characterized as within incidental variation and larger than expected for \u201cincidental splenomegaly\u201d based on the authors\u2019 experiences. Of the seven ferrets in which splenic cytology was available, lymphoma was confirmed in the four ferrets in which the spleen was considered abnormal and cytology was performed. Of the three ferrets spleens in which cytology was performed and the spleen was considered within incidental variation, lymphoma was identified in one, and extramedullary hematopoiesis was confirmed in the other two.",

Mycobacteriosis can be diagnosed on cytology and biopsy of the affected lymph node or organ.25 Granulomatous inflammatory syndrome is a newly recognized systemic disease associated with coronavirus that causes inflammation in the spleen and lymph nodes.23 This syndrome results in a severe granulomatous disease that can affect the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Unlike lymphoma, it is usually seen in younger ferrets, but like lymphoma, clinical signs are nonspecific and depend on the organ that is affected. Patients with this syndrome usually have polyclonal gammopathy that can also be seen with Aleutian's disease virus and lymphoma. Definitive diagnosis requires cytology or biopsy of the affected organs.23 Aleutian's Disease is a parvovirus that can cause lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. As with lymphoma and granulomatous inflammatory syndrome, Aleutian's Disease can cause a polyclonal gammopathy. Ferrets with this virus usually present with generalized signs of illness (lethargy, weight loss) as well as neurologic signs such as paresis or tremors.24 Aspirates and biopsy samples of lymph nodes and the spleen can be difficult to interpret as the disease causes lymphoplasmacytic inflammation that can be easily confused with other diseases such as small cell lymphoma and Epizootic Catarrhal Enteritis.24\n",

Hepatic lipidosis, identified in four ferrets, was not associated with radiographic or sonographic changes and may have been due to inappetence.26 Given these findings, ultrasound does not appear to be sensitive for the detection of hepatic lymphoma in ferrets. Sensitivity of ultrasound for hepatic lymphoma has also been reported to be low in dogs, cats, and humans.27, 28 One of two ferrets with renal masses had probable renal lymphoma based on the response to treatment.

An alternate possibility is that lysis may be relatively easier to detect in the lumbar spine where there is less superimposition of structures over the vertebrae, compared to the thoracic vertebrae where the ribs proximally are superimposed on the vertebrae. In humans with primary bone lymphoma, three radiographs patterns are described: the lytic\u2010destructive pattern, which is predominantly lytic with or without a lamellated or interrupted periosteal reaction or cortical lysis; the blastic\u2010sclerotic pattern in which there are mixed lytic and sclerotic regions; and \u201cnear\u2010normal\u201d findings in which there are only subtle radiographic changes and additional imaging (scintigraphic bone scans or MRI) is required.29 Osseous lesions seen in the ferrets of this study and the prior reports are similar to the lytic\u2010destructive pattern, and had cortical disruption.

            "text": "Diffuse central nervous system infiltration with lymphoma was present in one ferret. As lymphoma outside of the central nervous system was only detected in accessory adrenal tissues, this ferret presumably had a primary central nervous system lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma in dogs and cats has not been reported to have an extraparenchymal vs. an intraparenchymal predilection.30 In humans, lesions with primary central nervous system lymphoma are most frequently intraparenchymal, and metastatic central nervous system lymphoma is more frequently extraparenchymal.30, 31 In this ferret, the meninges and choroid plexus were involved in addition to the brain and spinal cord. Protracted clinical signs in that ferret consisted of variable paraparesis and lumbar pain over 8 months from the start of clinical signs to the final diagnosis of lymphoma at necropsy. Gradual progression of signs and the protracted clinical signs suggests a relatively slow\u2010growing process. Prednisone, administered for palliative treatment, was started approximately 3 months after the initial clinical signs. Radiographs and ultrasound, performed prior to starting prednisone, had minimal, nonspecific findings. Magnetic resonance imaging, performed 1 month after initiation of the prednisone regimen and 5 months prior to the diagnosis of lymphoma, was inconclusive. Administration of prednisone prior to the MRI may have resulted in partial regression of lymphoma, therefore making it more difficult to identify; however, the ferret did not demonstrate improvement of the clinical signs so whether prednisone affected detection of neoplastic infiltration or not is speculative. Additionally the MRI was limited in that only T2w images were obtained. Perhaps if additional sequences were performed, particularly T1w postcontrast images, or if a follow\u2010up MRI was performed at a later date, meningeal or parenchymal abnormalities may have been detected. Also because the necropsy was performed 5 months following MRI, it is likely that the extent of the lesions seen postmortem had progressed compared to at the time of imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions in dogs and cats with primary central nervous system lymphoma (compared to white matter) have been reported to be predominantly T2w hyperintense with indistinct margins, T1w hypointense, contrast enhancing, had perilesional hyperintensity on FLAIR consistent with perilesional edema, and had a mass effect.30 In humans, lesions have similar signal characteristics (compared to white matter) being T2w hyperintense, T1w iso\u2010 to hypointense, and contrast enhancing.30, 31 These findings are considered nonspecific in dogs, cats, and humans, and lesions may not be detected with MRI at the onset of clinical signs.30, 31\n",

The small number of ferrets able to be included during the time frame of the study likely reflects that imaging is not performed in every ferret with suspected or confirmed lymphoma, and that a definitive diagnosis was not always attained prior to treatment in individuals with suggestive clinical and imaging findings. Ultrasound\u2010guided aspirates of lymph nodes, spleens, and aggressive osseous lesions performed in ferrets of this study were each diagnostic for or strongly suggestive of lymphoma. Although aspirates are often the initial tissue sampling procedure, previous reports have cautioned the use of lymph node aspirates in the diagnosis of lymphoma as inflammatory and reactive changes may be misinterpreted as lymphoma.1, 3 This is particularly true of the gastric lymph node in ferrets with gastrointestinal signs. A false positive diagnosis of lymphoma is considered not likely to have occurred in the ferrets included for in this study. Lack of a definitive diagnosis (i.e., false negative results) from aspirate samples likely resulted in exclusion of some individuals from this study. Analysis of the frequency of misdiagnosis and nonconfirmatory aspirate samples in patients with lymphoma was not performed. This study was also limited in that histopathology was not performed on all organs in each individual, and therefore, whether or not the changes seen were each attributable to lymphoma cannot be confirmed. Additionally, because ultrasound findings were based on the reports and images obtained; some structures were unable to be reassessed. This is particularly the case in which multiple lymph nodes were affected. Images of each lymph node may not have been attained, the imaging report may not have been complete in describing which nodes were affected, and measurement performed retrospectively on the available static images may not have reflected the actual maximal nodal thickness in that individual.",
