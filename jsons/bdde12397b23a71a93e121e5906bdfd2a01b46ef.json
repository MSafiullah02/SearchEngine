SARS infection is important because of its high infectivity and unpredictable clinical course, which is characterized by a high mortality rate [1] . It has been observed that clinical severity in patients may vary, from a febrile condition with mild respiratory symptoms and radiological evidence of lung involvements to severe respiratory distress with extensive lung damage requiring assisted ventilation [1, 3] . Individual susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV also appear to be variable. Lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count, !1000/mm 3 ) is commonly observed with the onset of clinical symptoms. T lymphocytes seem preferentially destroyed, but B cells are spared [1, 4] . Although it is evident that lung involvement is immunological in nature, there is thus far no known effective treatment of this infection [1, 3] . In most of autoimmune pathogenesis, both environmental and genetic factors-especially HLA genotypes, which influence the ability of T cells to respond to a particular antigen or viral protein-clearly are important [5] .

Except for a trend toward a higher frequency of HLA-B13 in the ICU-admitted patients with SARS versus the non-ICU-admitted patients with SARS ( ), there was no correlation between HLA genotypes P p .06 and either ICU admissions or deaths related to SARS. A previous HLA study, conducted in a group of 33 Taiwanese patients who were probably infected with SARS, suggested that the fre-quency of the HLA-B*4601 genotype was significantly higher in a subgroup of 6 patients with severe SARS infections than in a group of 101 high-risk uninfected health-care workers [12] . In our study, however, we did not observe any association between HLA-B*4601 and SARS; even in the 16 ICU-admitted patients with SARS (with known HLA-B typing) and in the 7 patients with SARS who died during the episode, the frequency of HLA-B*4601 was not significantly higher than that in the overall Hong Kong Chinese population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1290, "end": 1294, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 338, "text": "(table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Of special interest is the strong association, in our patients with SARS, between HLA-B*0703 and -B60: 8 of the 9 patients with HLA-B*0703 coinherited HLA-B60, which alone did not demonstrate any excessive risk of SARS. The frequency of B*0703 and B60 coinheritance (9.6% [95% CI, 4.6%-19.0% in our patients with SARS was significantly higher than the frequency expected (0.4%) in the overall Hong Kong Chinese population ( ). It is possible that B*0703 confers \u03ea9 P p 3 \u03eb 10 a genetic susceptibility to infection with SARS, whereas B60 may play a secondary role in the pathogenesis. On the other hand, our data support the idea that DRB1*0301 provides protection against infection with SARS. It will be worthwhile to conduct further biological and functional studies involving specific HLA proteins found in the present study, to clarify their participation in the pathogenesis of SARS. Although the involvement of these HLA proteins in the pathogenesis of SARS remains to be explored, the understanding of the genetic risks or protection conferred can be viewed from 2 perspectives: in relation to (1) the control of viral proliferation and persistence and (2) the participation in autoimmune pathogenesis. In the former perspective, studies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and infection with human papillomavirus suggest that certain HLA genotypes influence the host's ability to clear the virus and avoid persistence [13] [14] [15] . There is evidence that, in HCV infection, DQB1*0301 provides a protective effect by linking with the antiviral-effector pathway involving CD4 helper cells [13] . Genetic-association studies have strongly suggested that class II restricted responses may be important in immunological control of disease outcome, although the genes implicated in different studies vary [13] . Ninety-eight percent of our patients with SARS developed lymphopenia, which characteristically marks the onset of symptoms. Decreases of both CD4 + and CD8 + cells were also commonly observed and, when found at presentation, were associated with adverse outcomes [4] . By contrast, there was a relatively stable preservation of B cells [4] . It can be postulated that the consistent early drop in the CD4 counts observed in patients with SARS [4] may be evidence that impairment of this CD4 T cell response affects SARS-CoV proliferation in DRB1*0301-negative patients with SARS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1416, "end": 1420, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1430, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1592, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1804, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2073, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2146, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2253, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Alternatively, there is a link between these HLA loci and other unknown determinants that govern both the course of infection with SARS and subsequent lung damage.
