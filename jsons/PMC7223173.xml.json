This has been perceived to result in a \u201cloneliness epidemic.\u201d Declared as a global epidemic by former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy (1), loneliness and social isolation are reported to occur in approximately one-third or more of older adults with 5% of those often or always feeling lonely (2, 3). Recent U.S.-based research suggests the range is 17% - 57% of persons experience loneliness, a figure that increases for those who have mental and physical health concerns, particularly those with heart disease, depression, anxiety, and dementia (4). Loneliness and social isolation have been shown to significantly impact older adults, both physically and emotionally. Areas of the older adult\u2019s life that can be negatively affected when the individual is experiencing loneliness and/or social isolation are listed in Table 1. The long-term (greater than four years) effects of loneliness and social isolation can be even more devastating, including; Increased blood pressure, depression, weight gain, smoking alcohol/drug use, and alone time (5) and decreased physical activity, cognition, heart health, and sleep, stroke and coronary heart disease, in particular (6).\n",

Depression can play a major role in loneliness and needs to be treated either with group behavioral therapy especially when minor depression (dysphoria) and medications or electroconvulsive therapy when major depression (15). Cognitive impairment needs to be assessed and where possible reversible causes need to be treated (16).

The group of approximately eight older adults who have self-identified as being lonely or socially isolated meet 12 times over three months with a facilitator for the purpose of making new friends, feeling less lonely, sharing feelings of loneliness with others: experiencing meaningful things together; and transitioning into a self-supportive group who continues to meet after the initial three months (22). Each session includes three components: 1) Art and inspiring activities with discussion; 2) group exercise and health-themed discussion; and 3) therapeutic writing with sharing and reflecting on issues related to loneliness (23). Evidence for the effectiveness of Circle of Friends\u00a9 has been reported by the founders of the intervention to suggest that the intervention is well suited for delivery with older adult populations living in the community, adult day centers, and residential facilities. Outcomes for participants encompass physical and emotional health and health care utilization. Specifically, in a two-year post-intervention study, 97% of participants were still living, reported improved subjective health with decreased health care costs and hospitalizations, only 2.5% had dropped out, and 6 of 15 groups were still meeting (24). Similarly, a later study reports 95% of participants no longer feel lonely, 45\u201385% made new friends, 40% of the groups continued meetings, and feeling of being needed and psychological well-being improved (25, 26).",

Both funded through the St. Louis Senior Fund, Circle of Friends\u00a9 is being offered at the Association for Aging and Developmental Disabilities and through a collaborative partnership between CHIPS (Community Health in Partnership) and the St. Louis Public Housing authority. Both Groups received training during Summer 2019 and launched multiple groups in the fall at locations in senior centers and housing complexes. Groups continue to meet at both agencies with plans to continue this successful intervention to bring older adults together to build new relationships. In addition, a rural hospital in Perry County and the Family Practice program at Saint Louis University are both providing Circle of Friends groups.
