In responding to this dire and unprecedented health crisis, as nurses, we are doing what we have been educated and prepared to do. As nurses, we have the knowledge and skills to deliver the care needed in all phases of the illness trajectory, and in reassuring, informing and supporting people within communities who are frightened, worried and wanting to stay well. As we have seen throughout history, nurses are well able to think outside the box, and develop creative and innovative solutions to all manner of problems, conundrums and challenges. However, there remains much about this current situation that is new and frightening. For one is the speed of the spread of COVID\u201019. In the fight against COVID\u201019, we are working against the clock. The trajectory of this situation is such that in some areas, infection rates are doubling every 24 hr or so, and this is leading to increasing community anxiety manifesting in various ways including panic buying and hoarding of essential supplies.",

There is some speculation as to whether rates of domestic violence might increase at this time as a result of the extraordinary strain that families face. Poverty is also an issue. It is well known and accepted that those who are homeless and impoverished have many less options when faced with health problems, and the challenges faced by these people will be much greater in this time of pandemic (Tsai & Wilson, 2020). Similarly, people who are captive or imprisoned for any reason, such as in corrections or refugee environments and other similar settings, are particularly vulnerable (Iacobucci, 2020).",

Many in this group live with multiple health and social issues that increase their vulnerability, now further exacerbated by the need for social distancing. Older people are known to be at greater risk of calamitous outcomes associated with COVID\u201019, and this dire picture is likely to be exacerbated because of the potential for rationing of care based on age, simply because there are not enough ventilators and other life\u2010saving equipments to meet demand. The risk to older people is greater than to others, and in many countries, limitations on older people activities are in place in attempts to reduce risk of exposure. In several countries, restrictions on visiting nursing homes are in place and people over 70 years of age asked to reduce outings and remain indoors as much as possible to decrease contact with others and reduce the risk of contracting the virus. While necessary, this could put older people at risk of loneliness, isolation and exacerbation of existing problems, and so it is very important that we all look out for older people in our neighbourhoods and provide support, assistance and safe social interaction as required.",

Despite initial fears, the spread of the virus appeared to have been effectively controlled over the last two months through the use of stringent measures, including practice of good personal hygiene, avoidance of group gatherings and implementation of social isolation measures. Indeed, by the beginning of March 2020 some public services in Hong Kong had started to resume normal activity and many people were returning to the workplace. In some part, these successes were due to the excellence of the clinical nursing workforce. We saw some stability in other countries in the same region including Singapore and Taiwan. There was hope that the corner had been turned in the fight against COVID\u201019; however, this has turned out not to be the case. Very recently, Hong Kong and several other South\u2010East Asian countries have started to face the second wave of imported coronavirus infections, with the total number of cases in Hong Kong doubling during this period. The vast majority of these new cases have involved people flying to South\u2010East Asia from abroad, especially students returning from North America and Europe, where COVID\u201019 infection has been escalating. Singapore and Taiwan, which had each taken comfort from seeing new infections taper off in recent weeks, have also seen surges of COVID\u201019 cases amongst arrivals in recent days. Health officials from these densely populated countries are now struggling to contain the new cases to avoid any new community outbreaks.",

After some sustained and marked reductions in the spread of the virus, China's National Health Commission have recently announced that all new reported cases were imported from overseas. Despite many people fully recovering from COVID\u201019 infection in China, there has been some concern that a new subset of patients affected by the virus may be emerging. There are reports that a handful of the many thousands of people declared cured after treatment have been readmitted to hospitals because their symptoms have returned. At the time of writing, this worrying feature of COVID\u201019 infection is only beginning to receive attention by the medical community, but clearly requires close consideration in the ongoing global fight against COVID\u201019.",

In Australia, authorities are considering various mechanisms such as fast\u2010tracking return to registration of qualified nurses who may be recently retired and allowing limited registration to people who may be suitable such as internationally qualified nurses. In the United Kingdom, there has also been a call for recently retired nurses to return to practice. Other planned strategies include establishing a COVID\u201019 temporary register for nurses who have left the register within the past three years, who will be able to opt into this register. Registered nurses not currently working clinically will be encouraged to consider working within clinical practice, and undergraduate nursing students will be able to opt to undertake the final six months of their programme as a clinical placement. Part of the COVID\u201019 temporary register is to include a specific student element for those in the final six months of their preregistration programme and will include details of specific conditions to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place. The fine details are still in development, and there may need to be further measures in what is a continually changing situation.",

While there are some aspects of nursing that may not have changed too much over the years, health is generally a rapidly evolving field and particularly in the current situation. In contemplating returning to direct care giving roles, many retired nurses or others contemplating re\u2010entry may have legitimate concerns about the real contribution that they could make in the current crises, particularly when considering direct care delivery and technological advancements in practice. It will be necessary to consider carefully any possible risk for nurses returning from retirement, and the potential ways these nurses could meaningfully contribute. This may be in working in quieter areas to free up current staff, and working in roles supporting front\u2010line nurses. Either way, it will be crucial to have adequate learning and resourcing available to support these new cadres of nurses. However, as we identify innovative ways to provide a nursing workforce during this time of urgency, it is important that whatever we implement is safe and appropriate for staff and for patients. Patient safety is paramount and integral to nursing practice.",

We are now in a situation where nurses everywhere are bracing for what really is a tsunami of death.

Some have restricted student presence in their organisations, while others welcome healthy students. Academic nurses have also been quick to modify in the light of the crisis caused by COVID\u201019 and many have very quickly moved to online course delivery, including strategising to ensure reasonable student engagement, and making appropriate changes to examination procedures. There is also the need to recognise that many nurses currently enrolled in post\u2010graduate courses may now have their current studies jeopardised because of cancellation of study leave or other pre\u2010existing work patterns that can now no longer be guaranteed. Nurse educators and administrators are tasked with ensuring that students meet academic requirements while recognising the current pressures faced by health services and the need for nurses to be able to simultaneously meet the demands on them as nurses, students, parents, siblings, partners and the myriad of other roles that each nurse has to manage in their daily lives.",

We have to prepare for the potential ramifications if COVID\u201019 takes hold in very vulnerable populations, such as prisons where it will be very hard to contain because of the proximity of people.
