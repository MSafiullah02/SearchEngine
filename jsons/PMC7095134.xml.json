However, it should be noted that some of WHO\u2019s recommendations are not evidence-based. WHO recommendations that \u201ccorticosteroids should be avoided\u201d in severely ill H1N1-infected patients seem to be based on the possibility of viral shedding by using corticosteroids during severe H1N1 infection [2]. Really, there is not any evidence in the literature that the viral load could return to peak levels for the administration of corticosteroids, whilst only the detection of some viral RNA in body samples during convalescence may have no clinical significance [3]. Moreover, data from quantitative analysis of viral shedding may have more important implications for formulating clinical prognosis and risks.",

The quality of RNA purified from the samples was assessed by an rRTPCR primers/probe panel directed to the human RNase P gene (Invitrogen SuperScript\u2122 III Platinum\u00ae One-Step Quantitative Kit). At ICU admission, the physician in charge avoided treating the patient with corticosteroids in accordance with the recommendations of WHO, but after a week of oseltamivir, protective mechanical ventilation (MV), pronation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the patient was still in a life-threatening condition, so MP infusion was initiated. Within a few days, the patient significantly improved and, after 6 and 10 days, respectively, he was weaned from ECMO and MV without any major adverse effect. The initial viral load in BAL before oseltamivir was 6.54 \u00d7 108 copies/ml, then reduced to 2.14 \u00d7 103 copies/ml when oseltamivir stopped and MP started, and mildly increased to a maximum of 7.40 \u00d7 103 copies/ml after 7 days of MP infusion (Fig. 1). The magnitude of virus copies amount was consistent with a clear reduction in comparison to the initial viral load in spite of adjunct corticosteroids. The viral load was determined by using the Quantification of Swine H1N1 Influenza Human Pandemic Strain-Advanced Kit (PrimerDesign, Southampton, UK). No viral mutations associated with virulence (D222G) and resistance to oseltamivir (H274Y) were detected by sequencing Ha and NA genes.\n",
