RT-LAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92) compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature heating and visual inspection.

Due to its nonspecific symptoms and radiological features overlapping with those of the common cold and influenza, the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection entirely depends entirely on viral RNA detection. [2] [3] RT-qPCR is the standard and widely used method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical laboratories. 4 Despite its outstanding analytical performance, RT-qPCR detection for COVID-19 still suffers from many limitations, such as long turnaround times (more than 2 h), poor availability (it is currently restricted to public health laboratories), requirement of expensive instrumentation, and high proportion of false negatives or equivocal values (up to 38%) [5] [6] in upper respiratory samples due to insufficient viral materials. These limitations make the RT-qPCR test far from adequate to meet the current challenge of a tremendous undocumented infected population, asymptomatic transmission 7 and convalescence with viral RNA conversion, 8 which highlights the pressing need for a more rapid, simple and sensitive approach to quickly identify infected patients in different settings.",

This approach allows reverse transcription and DNA amplification to be accomplished rapidly at a 60-65 \u2103 constant temperature in less than an hour and in one step, and detailed amplification mechanisms have been reported previously. 10 RT-LAMP can be detected by visual turbidity or fluorescence in real time, which makes this method a practical near-patient assay. In recent years, RT-LAMP has been widely used in specialized laboratory testing as well as field surveys to identify various pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 11 Zika virus, 12 MERS-CoV, 13 and SARS-CoV. 14 Shirato et al. 13 reported a useful RT-LAMP assay for the diagnosis of MERS that was developed in this way, with a detection limit of 3.4 copies per reaction and no cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses. Hong et al. 14 developed a real-time quantitative RT-LAMP for the early and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV, which demonstrated 100-fold greater sensitivity than conventional RT-qPCR.",

Figure S3 shows the overall procedure of the RT-LAMP assay. RT-LAMP primers for COVID-19 were specific and had a 9.14-37.56% nucleotide mismatch with SARS, MERS and other coronavirus sequences (Table   S2 ), and a cross-interface experiment further demonstrated that RT-LAMP did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and common virus pathogens, supporting the specificity of this assay for COVID-19 ( Figure S4 ). Our dilution experiments of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 S gene showed shown the analytic limit of detection (LOD) of RT-LAMP relative to that of RT-qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S5 ). The resulting LOD was approximately 1.5\u00d710 -8 ng per 25-\u03bcL reaction solution (i.e., 4.23 copies/reaction) for RT-LAMP and 1.5\u00d710 -7 ng/reaction (i.e., 42.3 copies/reaction) for RT-qPCR.

This added sensitivity is important in consideration of a significant number of COVID-19 patients that have presented with negative qPCR 7 results or the \"relapse after negative\" phenomenon 8 due to potentially large variability between clinical samples, low-virus-titer samples and even disrupted binding of RT-qPCR primers due to variation in the viral genome. 19 We used the self-developed Bst DNA polymerase in this RT-LAMP assays, which was demonstrated a higher polymerization activity than the commercial Bst DNA polymerase 20 and ensured the high sensitivity of this RT-LAMP method.

RT-LAMP also showed no cross-reactivity with other viruses that manifest similar respiratory diseases, and thus, the specificity of RT-LAMP was higher than that reported for the IgM and IgG detection. 25 In addition, we described the accuracy of COVID-19 RT-LAMP by means of likelihood ratios. Likelihood ratios are not affected by disease prevalence, and their values higher than ten and lower than one strongly support the diagnostic value of a test. 26 Based on this metric, the near-patient LAMP assay used in this study is diagnostically useful for COVID-19. Overall, the established RT-LAMP in this study could be a powerful complementary method for monitoring massive numbers of exposed individuals as well as aiding with screening efforts in hospitals and public domains, especially in areas with limited laboratory capacities.",

Liu et al. 27 reported that the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs was lower than that in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum. This inconsistency is most likely due to poor sputum quality and fluctuation of virus RNA during different stages of the disease course. 28 Despite this inconsistency, nasopharyngeal swabs are noninvasive and easy to acquire, and evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 replicates actively in upper respiratory tissue. 29 Therefore, we argue that nasopharyngeal swabs are suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage of infection.",

Contaminant issues are not rare for nucleic acid testing, even when the best available reference laboratory tests are used. Precautions to prevent cross-contamination or aerosol contaminants during assay are highly recommended, including using a spray solution for the elimination of potential RNA fragments and changing gloves frequently. The RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP assay could address this important question. 18 Since this study was completed, the SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP test has been optimized further, with the use of lyophilized reagents and direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 without any need to conduct RNA extraction. This one-step single-tube RT-LAMP hastens reaction time and minimizes false positive reactions and would be an ideal POCT for COVID-19",
