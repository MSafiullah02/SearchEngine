            "text": "Human-mediated changes in landscapes and shifts in wildlife populations are the primary drivers of pathogen outbreaks worldwide (Daszak et al., 2000, Jones et al., 2008). In the past two decades, the emergence of infectious diseases in humans, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza A viruses, have served to increase scientific and public awareness of the causal links between wildlife, domestic animals and human populations in driving outbreaks (Jones et al., 2008). The transmission of infectious agents from domesticated populations to sympatric wild populations, known as pathogen spillover (Daszak et al., 2000), has infamously led to marked declines in wild vertebrate populations, such as occurred in Kenya when 90% of wild African buffalos succumbed to rinderpest virus that originated from imported Asian cattle (Mack, 1970). In contrast to vertebrate studies, cases of pathogen spillover in insects are rare and the aetiology of insect diseases are largely unknown, despite accumulating evidence of human-mediated population decline and extinction (Samways, 2005, Dunn, 2005).",

There is growing concern that pollinators may be declining at a global scale, particularly as the cultivation of pollinator dependent crops has steadily increased in the last 45 years (Aizen and Harder, 2009). The best evidence for regional declines of entire bee communities comes from Europe, where citizen science data from Britain and The Netherlands indicate that 52% and 67%, respectively, of areas surveyed experienced a decline in bee species richness since 1980 (Biesmeijer et al., 2006). Currently, across Europe 37\u201367% of bee species are on lists of conservation concern (Patiny et al., 2009). Habitat loss and fragmentation is considered the most important factor driving bee declines (Winfree et al., 2009), but the role of disease in pollinator declines has recently been the focus of intense research, primarily due to dramatic declines of the major commercial pollinator, the honeybee Apis mellifera (Neumann and Carreck, 2010). However, wild bumble bees (Bombus) have also experienced marked declines with potentially 11% of all species worldwide listed as \u201cnear threatened\u201d or above using the IUCN Red List criteria (Williams and Osborne, 2009, Winfree, 2010). For some North American species, pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is hypothesized to have contributed to rapid range contractions (up to 87% in the past 30 years; Thorp, 2003, Cameron et al., 2011, Szabo et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Since the development of breeding techniques in the late 1980s allowing year-round production, bumble bee hives are now mass produced for the pollination of over 20 different crops (Velthuis and van Doorn, 2006). Currently, commercially reared hives are imported by over 50 countries across the globe with an estimated annual value of \u20ac55 million (Velthuis and van Doorn, 2006, Ings, 2007). However, the trade in bumble bees frequently involves introductions of non-native species, e.g. Bombus terrestris has been imported by over 57 countries, 16 are outside its native range (Ings, 2007, Ings et al., 2010). B. terrestris has now become established in the wild in Japan (Inari et al., 2005), Chile (Ruz, 2002) and Argentina (Torretta et al., 2006), and was intentionally introduced into New Zealand in 1885 and spread to Tasmania in 1992 (Schmid-Hempel et al., 2007). In parallel with establishment, empirical data now supports other negative impacts associated with the introduction of non-native bumblebees such as modification of native plant community structures (Kenta et al., 2007), displacement of native bumble bee species (Inoue et al., 2008), hybridization between closely related taxa (Kanbe et al., 2008, Kraus et al., 2011) and pathogen spillover from non-native commercial to native wild populations (Goka et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Commercial bumble bee rearing facilities provide ideal conditions for the development of pathogens and parasites due to the high density of hosts facilitating disease transmission, and the provision of ad libitum food that increases the likelihood of host survival and reproduction, despite potentially high pathogen loads (e.g. Brown et al., 2000). Elevated parasite loads have been reported in commercially reared species: tracheal mites (Locustacarus buchneri) in European hives of B. terrestris in Japan (Goka et al., 2000); microsporidian infection in North American B. occidentalis (Whittington and Winston, 2003), and intestinal protozoa in North American B. impatiens (Otterstatter and Thomson, 2008). Transmission to wild bees is facilitated by the lack of preventative measures taken to reduce the escape of commercial bumble bees from the target crop, e.g. up to 73% of pollen collected by foragers in tomato greenhouses originated from plants outside the greenhouse (Whittington et al., 2004). The potential spread of pathogens from commercial to wild Bombus populations was first documented in studies of the tracheal mite L. buchneri in Japan, where mitochondrial DNA sequences indicated that haplotypes found in commercially reared B. ignitus originated in European rearing facilities (Goka et al., 2001) but are now present in native populations due to spillover (Goka et al., 2006). Colla et al. (2006) found elevated levels of Crithidia and Nosema parasites in two Canadian bumble bee populations close to greenhouses actively using commercial B. impatiens for pollination, compared to four populations with no commercial bumble bees. Furthermore, the spatial pattern of infection within the immediate area of greenhouses agreed with predictions from spillover models of initial primary infection with Crithidia (Otterstatter and Thomson, 2008).",

            "text": "Despite the lack of evidence directly linking spillover and decreased abundance in wild populations (reviewed in Meeus et al., 2011), major bumble bee parasites have been shown to impose significant morbidity on laboratory populations of Bombus. Crithida bombi and the recently identified C. expoeki (Schmid-Hempel and Tognazzo, 2010) infect multiple Bombus species in Europe and North America and are known to reduce lifetime reproductive output of B. terrestris queens by 40% when infected prior to hibernation (Brown et al., 2003), and increase worker mortality rate by 50% in conjunction with starvation (Brown et al., 2000). The virulence of another generalist gut parasite, the microsporidian N. bombi, varies across species (Rutrecht and Brown, 2009), but can deform wings, decrease the survival of workers and males, prevent queens from mating (Otti and Schmid-Hempel, 2007, Otti and Schmid-Hempel, 2008). Rapidly declining North American bumble bee species have a higher prevalence of N. bombi compared to stable species (Cameron et al., 2011). The neogregarine Apicystis bombi infects the adipose tissue of bumble bees and has been correlated with high mortality in post-hibernation B. pratorum queens (Rutrecht and Brown, 2008). Although apparently absent from native species in Argentina, A. bombi has been found in 4\u201312% of invasive B. terrestris (Plischuk et al., 2009, Plischuk et al., 2011) and has now spread to honey bees (A. mellifera) in the same region (Plischuk et al., 2011). Finally, high levels of tracheal mite L. buchneri infestation have been associated with lethargy and the cessation of foraging in workers (Husband and Shina, 1970), and reduced lifespan in Canadian B. occidentalis (Otterstatter and Whidden, 2004), but it now appears to have been successfully controlled by commercial breeders after spillover to wild populations was confirmed (Goka et al., 2006).",

Furthermore, laboratory studies suggest that pathogen transmission is greatest among closely related bumble bees (Durrer and Schmid-Hempel, 1995, Schmid-Hempel and Loosli, 1998) and allopatric infections result in higher mortality (Imhoof and Schmid-Hempel, 1998); thus, pathogens escaping from commercial hives would most likely spread and have the greatest negative impacts on wild conspecifics. Therefore, we aim to: (i) quantify the permeability of different strawberry cropping systems to commercial bumble bees; (ii) assess the potential of commercially reared B. terrestris colonies to act as pathogen reservoirs by comparing the prevalence of four pathogens (A. bombi, Crithidia spp., N. bombi and L. buchneri) among commercially reared hives and allopatric conspecific populations; and (iii) determine the likelihood of pathogen spillover from commercial bees to allopatric conspecifics by dissecting and recording parasitic infections present among bumble bees foraging in areas of decreasing proximity to horticultural activities where commercially reared bumble bees were employed.",

Spatial autocorrelation of disease prevalence was assessed by Mantel tests of geographic distance versus the proportion of individuals infected across sites. All randomization tests and post-hoc Tukey\u2019s honest significant difference (HSD) tests were two-tailed and significance evaluated via 5000 randomizations without replacement as implemented in Poptools (Hood, 2010). Randomizations were conducted within, rather than across, sites to retain the observed level of inter-site variance.

Across six sites in eastern Ireland and sampling at five distances from greenhouses, we found that the prevalence of Crithidia within adjacent populations of B. terrestris was highest at 11\u201318% within 2 km of greenhouses compared to 5% at 10 km. We also observed a decline in the probability of Crithidia infection in workers (25\u201311%) and of N. bombi infection in males (49\u201312%) from 250 m to 10 km from greenhouses that used commercial hives (Fig. 4). These data support previous preliminary Canadian surveys of bumble bee parasites whereby 15\u201327% and 15% of bees within 500 m of two greenhouse sites containing commercial bumble bees (B. impatiens) were infected with C. bombi and N. bombi, respectively, in contrast to 0% and <4% detectable infection at four sites without commercial hives (Colla et al., 2006). Similarly, in a follow-up study by Otterstatter and Thomson (2008), C. bombi infections from commercial to Canadian wild bumble bees agreed with predictions for spillover from spatially explicit models where prevalence was greatest (10\u201330%) within 500 m and declined to below 5% between 1.5 and 4.5 km from greenhouses. Given the disparity between the Irish (B. terrestris-strawberry production) and Canadian (B. impatiens-tomato/bell pepper production) systems, the congruence in results strongly supports the generality of increased infection rate in wild bumble bees due to pathogen spillover near agricultural areas that use commercial bumble bees.",

However, there is a serious lack of empirical data regarding the epidemiology of most pathogens associated with bumble bees, particularly wild populations (Salath\u00e9 and Schmid-Hempel, 2011, Ruiz-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012). We found the spread of disease up to 10 km from greenhouses importing commercial colonies of B. terrestris to be highly sex- and parasite-specific, where a decrease in Crithidia infection was detected in workers with increasing distance from greenhouses, but not in males, and vice versa for N. bombi infection. As horizontal transmission is facilitated by commercial bees foraging outside of greenhouses (Fig. 2) and both males and workers are produced in abundance by commercial B. terrestris hives in agricultural habitats (Goulson et al., 2002), our data may reflect the interaction between sex-specific flight-range and pathogen-specific modes of transmission. Workers of B. terrestris do not forage in the immediate vicinity of their nest but, depending on the landscape structure, typically forage between 0.2 km and 1.5 km (Osborne et al., 2008, Wolf and Moritz, 2008). In contrast, males typically fly between 2.6 and 9.9 km and, therefore, may be important long-range vectors of disease (Kraus et al., 2009). With regards to the parasites, C. bombi transmission is thought to be rapid and extensive as new hosts are quickly infected through the faeces in the nest (Otterstatter and Thomson, 2008) and through shared use of flowers by foragers (Durrer and Schmid-Hempel, 1995). In comparison, N. bombi is believed to spread slowly through novel populations as transmission primarily occurs via contaminated pollen or nectar fed to the larvae (Rutrecht et al., 2007) with subsequent inter-colony infections through drift of infected adults into non-natal colonies. Therefore, relative to workers, the long flight range of males and rapid transmission of Crithidia may have obscured any spatial trend in this sex over the distance sampled in this study. However, this does not explain how the relatively slow rate of transmission of N. bombi may have contributed to the weak decline in infection observed in near-flying workers compared to the marked decline in far-flying males. An alternative explanation may be that workers infected with N. bombi are less active and less likely to leave the nest (Shykoff and Schmid-Hempel, 1991), whereas males permanently leave the nest within a few days of eclosion (Goulson, 2003), thus infected workers are under-represented in field-caught samples and spatial trends in N. bombi infection are detected solely in males.",

Numerous theoretical and empirical studies of multiparasitic interactions within a host indicate that the two most likely outcomes are: exclusion by the most effective competitor or ongoing competition between parasites. For A. bombi, our data suggests the latter, where the probability of infection with A. bombi was 0.11, but in the presence of either Crithidia or N. bombi co-infection, this dropped to 0.06 for both parasites. Currently, little is known about its mode of transmission or epidemiology, but queens of B. pratorum rapidly die if infected with A. bombi in the spring (Rutrecht and Brown, 2008). Additionally, A. bombi did not overlap with other parasitic species in B. pratorum queens, but co-infections with the tracheal mite L. buchneri were observed in workers (2.2%, Rutrecht and Brown, 2008). Together, this suggests that Crithidia and N. bombi may competitively exclude A. bombi, which may subsequently benefit host populations by depressing the prevalence of this highly virulent parasite, particularly given the high mortality rate of queens at a critical time in the hosts\u2019 lifecycle. Given our confirmation of the presence of A. bombi in commercial European colonies of B. terrestris and its recent discovery in honeybees and invasive B. terrestris in North Patagonia (Plischuk et al., 2011), the complex dynamics of this parasite should be a priority for future research.",

Therefore, the observed pattern of infection within 2 km of greenhouses may be a product of the majority of bees collected being infected commercial B. terrestris, rather than pathogen spillover per se. However, although it not possible to directly observe pathogen spillover in the field, we do not believe this was the case. Firstly, unlike a previous study where the commercial and native bee were also indistinguishable in the field (Colla et al., 2006, Otterstatter and Thomson, 2008), we found no evidence of higher abundances of B. terrestris closer to greenhouses. With equal sampling effort, no statistical difference was found in the number of bees collected within 250 m of greenhouses versus 10 km (T.E.M., unpubl. data). Secondly, native B. terrestris audax queens are morphologically distinct from commercial B. terrestris, of which we collected 23 of the former and 11 of the latter near to greenhouses during the course of this study. Finally, the prevalence of A. bombi in commercial workers (0.3%) was quite different to the field-caught sample (12.3%; Fig. S2). Although the number and identity of colonies represented in the field-caught sample is currently unknown, we believe that the pattern of infection observed was not strongly biased by oversampling infected commercial bees within 2 km of greenhouses. At minimum, our data confirm the high permeability of strawberry cropping systems to commercial bees, the elevated level of pathogens in commercial hives and the presence of infected \u2018reservoir\u2019 populations adjacent to greenhouses with a high potential for spillover to wild bees.",

Many countries are signatories to international phyto- and zoo-sanitary agreements that are meant to prevent the spread of pests and parasites, but in almost all cases, health certification is based on parasites of direct threat to honey bees (A. mellifera), not bumble bees. Some countries (e.g. Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, Turkey, and the United States) have prohibited the importation of non-native bumble bees in favor of native congeners or conspecifics, but this still does not resolve the issue of elevated levels of parasites in commercial production facilities. Clearly, as in the case of the tracheal mite L. buchneri, bumble bee producers are committed to eliminating parasites in their commercial populations. However, even with the recent development of molecular tools (Meeus et al., 2010a, Meeus et al., 2010b), extensive screening of commercial populations and queens harvested from the wild may prove too costly and treatments for most pathogens are currently unavailable (Meeus et al., 2011).",

Given the high proportion of non-crop pollen collected by commercial bumblebees in all cropping systems recorded in this study (median of 30.5% greenhouses, 71.9% polytunnels, 96.6% open field; Fig. 2), interventions preventing the interaction of commercial and wild populations, such as the successfully established method of netting protected crop systems (greenhouses and plastic tunnels; Goka, 2010), negate the dangers of pathogen spillover and introgression (Kraus et al., 2011). However, commercial bumble bees are extensively used in open crop systems, despite a significant lack of data regarding the efficacy of commercial bumble bees in these systems (Lye et al., 2011). Furthermore, a posteriori, we found no relationship between the area of each cropping system per site and pathogen prevalence (Table S7), primarily due to the dominance of highly permeable open field systems found on all sites. Therefore, in combination with improved management practices, further legislative action is necessary to: (i) improve the health certification of commercial bumble bees before export or distribution; (ii) integrate with existing quarantine and inspection services upon importation; (iii) include environmental risk assessment and proof of pollination limitation as preconditions to importation. In combination with ongoing efforts from scientists, conservation bodies and commercial companies, encouraging the responsible use of commercial bumble bees could minimize or even eradicate pathogen spillover.",
