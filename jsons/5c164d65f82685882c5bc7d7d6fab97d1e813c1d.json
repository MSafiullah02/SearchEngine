With a similar NPSV approach, He/O 2 did not significantly reduce the intubation rate. However, hospital stay was shorter with He/O 2 . NPSV gas cost was higher with He/O 2 , but represents a small fraction of ICU costs. Hence, hospital stay and total costs were lower with He/O 2 . Further studies in decompensated COPD should be conducted to better define the place of He/O 2 NPSV, as it can be safely administered and could prove to be a cost-effective strategy.",

Lactate is commonly used as fluid for replacement during hemofiltration since its metabolism results to an alkalinization. But lactate is also a useful substrate permitting to carry energy and reducing equivalent among cells and organs. The use of exogenous lactate as replacement fluid may interfere with its metabolism, therefore the aim of this study was to investigate lactate metabolism in acutely ill patients undergoing hemofiltration. METHODS. Seven patients (4M/3F, age = 51.7 7 y, 18\u00b168) hospitalized in intensive care unit (APACHE II = 25 2.6, 16\u00b137) and were assigned to receive at one day interval and in a random order bicarbonate (BICAR) or lactate (LAC) as fluid replacement during hemofiltration. Lactate metabolism was investigated in both situations by using an exogenous lactate challenge test (1): 2.5 mmol/kg body weight were infused during 15 min and plasma lactate concentrations (L) in the blood and in the ultrafiltrate were followed at T = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min after the end of the perfusion.

Only the low GCS group showed a significant increase in ET-1 production compared to control (ANOVA p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. ET-1 production was significantly increased only in HAEC treated with CSF from low GCS patients who had already developed cerebral ischaemia on day 4 post-hemorrhage. However, there was no significant difference in ET-1 production in HAEC stimulated with CSF from patients with various degrees of vasospasm. These results suggest that ET-1 production may play a role in the early stages of neurological deterioration, and may be not responsible for the development of cerebral vasospasm in SAH patients.

INTRODUCTION. The pathogenesis behind nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) in particular ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is still controversial. The aim of the present study were to assess the development over time and impact of oropharyngeal and gastric colonisation on the emergence of tracheal colonisation possibly leading to VAP in mechanically ventilated patients in a Swedish multidisiplinary ICU. Special emphasis was made on elucidating the role of anaerobic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. METHODS. Consecutive patients (n = 41) requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 3 days were included. Patient characteristic were: median age 59 years (range 20\u00b182), 15/41 were females. Median APACHE II score was 19, range 0\u00b144, ICU mortality was 11/41. Ten of the patients had undergone transplantation, 32/41 patients had got at least one antibiotic before admission, 12/41 patients had clinical pneumonia at the time of admission. Samples were collected from oropharynx, subglottic space, trachea and stomach. The samples were collected after intubation and then every third day until day 33 or extubation. All samples were immediatly transported to the laboratory and frozen to \u00b170 C until analysed. RESULTS. Patients were heavy colonised ( > 60 % of samples) with microorganisms not considered belonging to a healthy normal gastric and oropharyngeal flora already at admission to the ICU. A majority of harboured enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci and candida spp. in at least one site on day 1. The patients were colonised with rather constant levels of microorganisms over time. Only in 4/41 an increasing concentration and in 9/41 a decreasing concentration over time in at least 50 % of the isolated species were found. An increasing load over time was associated with enterococci, gram-negative anaerobes and enterobacteriaceae. Decreasing levels occurred mainly in candida spp. We found anaerobes the majority were gram-negative, prevotella spp in subglottical and tracheal secret from day 12 to day 23 in a range between 40\u00b1100 % of all samples. Interestingly only one patient had pneumococci and one hemophilus influenzae species detected. One of the 41 patients developed VAP according to the criteria in the study. CONCLUSION. Patients in the ICU subjected to prolonged intubation showed a different pattern of colonisation as compared to the non-hospitalized population already at the time of admission to the unit. In some cases a colonisation pattern usually associated with long-stayers in the ICU was present from the start. In addition the presence of anaerobic species was high with a distribution also in the lower airways. This finding may be related to improved methodology in cultivating these strains. Obviously the colonisation pattern of ICU patients is variable over time as well as geographically. Therefore the relevance and applicability of literature reports for the individual unit must be interpreted with some caution. INTRODUCTION. Bacteria may gain entrance into the lung by several mechanisms.The major mechanism underlying the development of VAP seems to be (micro-) aspiration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPM) (1). The aim of this prospective observational study was to describe and assess the relationship between oropharyngeal (OC), gastric (GC) and tracheal colonization (TC) patterns preceding VAP in surgical patients. METHODS. During a two years period,consecutive adult surgical patients at high risk for VAP and not receiving antimicrobials were studied.Quantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates(ETA) reflecting TC were investigated daily, whereas oropharyngeal swabs and gastric aspirates were cultured in a qualitative manner, on admission and then thrice weekly until extubation.

Between December 1989 and December 1997, 916 patients were commenced on in-hospital total parenteral nutrition. The set-up, delivery and monitoring of TPN was performed by a specialist Intravenous Nutrition Service consisting of a dedicated IV nutrition nurse and a consultant intensive care physician. Referral for TPN was made through the appropriate team caring for the patient, or directly as part of the multidisciplinary team in the intensive care unit. The Intravenous Nutrition Service reviewed the biochemical profile of patients individually and prescribed TPN (including electrolytes) electively five times per week. The database of the Intravenous Nutrition Service was interrogated. Serum phosphate, magnesium and potassium levels were recorded daily prior to and following commencement of TPN. A detailed record was kept of the daily TPN prescription and this included phosphate, magnesium and potassium levels in the bag and supplemental phosphate, magnesium or potassium received. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Chi square on SPSS for Windows (Version 10). Significance was assumed at the five-percent level. RESULTS. The mean phosphate level decreased significantly (P < 0.001) after commencement of TPN. The prevalence of hypophosphatemia was 18.9 % prior to commencing TPN.

The prevalence of refeeding syndrome-associated biochemical abnormalities is high in hospitalised patients referred for TPN, but the incidence following the commencement of TPN is low. Hypomagnesemia was not a part of the refeeding syndrome following the introduction of TPN in the present study. This contasts with the pattern of refeeding hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia that were observed. The hypermetabolism in patients with severe head injuries results in malnutrition, impaired healing and an increased tendency to multiple organ failure (1). Thus, early and adequate nutritional support plays a crucial role in clinical outcome. The objectives of our study were to compare the ability of three different nutrition strategies to meet the caloric and protein requirements in severe head injury, and to study their effects on nitrogen balance. METHODS. 30 patients with GCS < 8 were randomly placed in enteral (EN) (n: 10), parenteral (PN) (n: 10) and combined enteral-parenteral nutrition (CN) (n: 10) groups. Targeted caloric intake was 30\u00b135 kcal/kg/day nonprotein and 1.5 gr/kg/day protein. Nitrogen balance, biochemical laboratory analysis and the amount of caloric intake were evaluated daily. RESULTS. The demographic data of the patients were similar between the groups. The mean targeted caloric intake of the groups were 2195 400 kcal/day in enteral, 2280 175 kcal/day in parenteral and 2225 270 kcal/day in combined nutrition groups (p: 0.9) (Table 1. ).

Respiratory Therapy and *Div. of Surgical Intensive Care, Dept. of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Surgical Intensive Care, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland INTRODUCTION. Incidence of atelectasis (ATLS) after cardiovascular or abdominal surgery is as high as 47\u00b192 %. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is widely used to prevent or treat postoperative ATLS. It is reported to improve oxygenation but its effect on the course of ATLS is not clear. Non invasive pressure support ventilation (NIPSV) improves tidal volume (Vt), gas exchange, respiratory rate and diaphragmatic activity[1]. The efficacy of NIPSV to resolve postoperative ATLS has never been studied. We hypothesized that it could be more effective than CPAP in this indication.CONCLUSION. NIPSV is a safe and well tolerated treatment, superior to CPAP regarding improvement of ATLS based on X-ray score and PaO 2 /FiO 2 after cardiovascular or abdominal surgery.The clinical impact of such treatment should be further investigated.REFERENCE. Appendini L, Am J Res Crit Care Med,'94 [2]Richter Larsen K, Intensive Care Med, 95INTRODUCTION. Ischaemic Hepatitis (IH) is an acute liver perfusion disturbance associated to shock states that causes a marked and transient elevation in the plasma aminotransferases activity following a typical pattern. Generally not related to previous hepatic disease, predisposing conditions such as cardiac or chronic respiratory disease are almost invariably present. METHODS. Retrospective review of the medical records of patients with a clinical history compatible with IH, admitted to the medical-surgical Intensive Care Unit between March 97 and March 2000. The diagnosis was established according to clinical and laboratory criteria: a) Transient elevation of serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) more than ten times the upper normal limit, b) normalization of enzymatic levels within the following days and c) exclusion of other known causes of acute liver injury in patients with an episode of shock or cardiac arrest or severe cardiac-respiratory failure.Laboratory data represent peak values. BUN: Blood urea nitrogen. Predisposing condition. CHF: Chronic heart failure, MI: Myocardial infarction. NYHA:New York Heart Association functional class.-COPD: Chronic pulmonary obstructive disease .CONCLUSION. IH was related to previous severe cardiac or respiratory disease in all patients of our series. It seems that chronic hepatic venous congestion is an important predisposing condition to develop IH during severe hypotension, hypoxemia or shock episodes. The intensivist should always be aware of this complication when these conditions coexist in a patient. .

Schmidt HB, Nuding S, Hoffmann T, Kuhn C, Loppnow H, Rauchhaus M, Werdan K. Department of Medicine III, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany INTRODUCTION. According to the hypothesis of \u00aaUncoupling of biological oscillators\u00ba(1), autonomic dysfunction is one of the main determinants exaggerating MODS. We have recently shown that the cardiorespiratory interplay (cardiac chemoreflex sensitivity[CCRS]) is the more blunted the more MODS is pronounced, but to date, there is no data available regarding the normal range values of this parameter. Our aim was to characterise CCRS in young healthy controls and to compare it with values obtained in MODS patients.",

Intensive Care Unit, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville, Australia INTRODUCTION. Review studies have suggested that early enteral nutrition (EN) may be of advantage compared with parenteral nutrition (PN) [1]. Meta-analytic techniques are used to address this issue. METHODS. Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing early EN with PN were identified by Medline search[1966\u00b12001]  and bibliographic review of relevant articles. Primary outcomes addressed were mortality, hospital length of stay (HLOS) and patient complications (all complications, infections and diarrhoea). Exclusion criteria included non-RCT, use of immuno-nutrition, PN compared with standard care and studies reporting only physiological variables. Treatment effects were expressed as risk difference (RD as percent, PN vs EN) for binary events and weighted mean difference for HLOS. Publication bias was identified by funnel plot and the quantitative methods of Begg, Egger and \u00aatrim and fill\u00ba. Modification of treatment effect was assessed by meta-regression for pre-defined confounders: age, gender, prenutritional albumin concentration and time to initiate nutrition (Ti: hours). RESULTS. Of 47 potential controlled trials, 26 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Study size ranged from 18 to 257 total patients, over the years 1980\u00b12001. Mean(SD) Ti did not differ betweenEN and PN (28(22)  vs 27(15), p = 0.91). Funnel plot inspection suggested publication bias, not identified by the Begg or Egger test. \u00aaTrim and fill\u00ba methodology suggested one potential missing study, but point estimate for mortality was not changed. No modification of mortality treatment effect was suggested by meta-regression (p > 0.5) or medical vs surgical sub-group analysis.CONCLUSION. EN was associated with a statistically and clinically significant reduction in complications and HLOS compared with PN.No mortality effect was observed.

            "text": "INTRODUCTION. Stringent criteria for severe sepsis and sepsis shock have been defined to standardize studies. However they all lack of specificity and particularly in patients hospitalized in ICU for more than 48 hours since organ dysfunction and other criteria may occur independently of infectious processes. METHODS. We evaluated both morbidity and mortality associated with ICU-acquired severe sepsis (i. e. after the 48 th hour).Data were prospectively collected in 6 intensive care units (ICUs) in France from 1997 to 2000. Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were defined according to Bone's criteria (1). The intensity of care was measured accordingly to the daily use of invasive procedures and by the Omega score. This score describes 47 diagnostic and therapeutic weighted items measured either daily or once during the ICU stay (2). We distinguished 4 groups: (A) No severe sepsis (B) Severe sepsis on admission (C) Severe sepsis occurring beyond the first 48 hours (D) Patients presenting a severe sepsis episode on both admission and after the first 48 hours. Data are expressed as percent or as median [25 %\u00b175 %] quartile. Variables were analyzed either by chi-square or by Kruskal Wallis test as needed. *, P < 0.0001 RESULTS. Secondary severe sepsis more frequently occurred in patients with severe sepsis on admission: 211/713 = 30 % vs. 128/985 = 13 % (P < 0.0001). The occurrence of severe sepsis after 48 hours was significantly associated with a higher ICU or hospital mortality and a higher resource consumption. This was observed whether or not the patient was initially admitted for severe sepsis. The total Omega score, which has been shown to closely correlate with the workload and direct cost of each stay(2), was also significantly higher in those patients. ",
