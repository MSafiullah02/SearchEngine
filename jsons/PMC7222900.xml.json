The main inflammatory cytokines and interleukins (IL) involved in this mechanism are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa-beta (NF-\u03ba\u03b2), IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2, surfactant protein-D, receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and club cell secretory protein (CC-16). Measuring the level of these proinflammatory molecules is challenging, cumbersome and expensive, however it has been shown by several studies that these induce procalcitonin (PCT)\u2014a commonly used inflammatory marker -, production and release [7\u20139]. Therefore, it has some rationale to monitor PCT values in order to evaluate their potential correlation with the development of VILI [10\u201316].",

Applying individual PEEP titrated during a decremental procedure after an ARM in order to optimize respiratory mechanics is the key to avoid hyperinflation of the lungs and even to prevent or reverse atelectasis and to achieve the so called open lung approach (OLA) [22\u201325]. The main advantages of protective OLA ventilation are improved respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, and prevention from VILI. These anticipated advantages may also improve postoperative recovery and survival rates, shorten in-hospital stay and reduce healthcare related costs. However, inappropriate PEEP values may lead to decreased pulmonary compliance and gas exchange disorders due to pulmonary atelectasis and/or hyperinflation of the lungs [20]. Additionally, results of recent trials suggested the use of moderate PEEP values (5\u20136 cmH2O) against low or high PEEP values. However, the effect of applying an individually titrated optimal PEEP (PEEPopt) on respiratory mechanics, oxygenation and even on the inflammatory response, and its correlation with postoperative complications has not entirely been evaluated yet. As radical cystectomy is considered major abdominal surgery and associated with high rates (50\u201372%) of postoperative complications [26\u201329] we decided to investigate this patient population. The purpose of this physiological trial was to compare the effects of a standard LPV applying a 6 cmH2O of PEEP with a LPV using an individually titrated PEEPopt on respiratory mechanics and oxygenation.",

Differences in proportions were evaluated using the Fisher\u2019s exact test, and risk ratio with associated 95% CI. Analysis of the primary endpoint (PPC) was carried out by the unpaired Student t test. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (2-way RM ANOVA) was used to compare the groups serum PCT levels. Relationship between PCT levels and organ dysfunctions was evaluated using the Pearson\u2019s correlation. Statistical analysis of SOFA scores, ICU days, in-hospital stay, in-hospital and 28-days mortality data of groups were implemented by the \u03c72 test. P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MedCalc Statistical Software v14.8.1 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium) was used for statistical analysis.",

Since Futier and colleagues published the results of IMPROVE Trial in 2013, intraoperative LPV has gained increasing interest and importance during general anaesthesia in routine anaesthetic care [5, 17, 41, 42]. The use of low TV (6 ml kg\u22121 of IBW) became common in intraoperative settings, however the so called intraoperative open lung approach (OLA) applying ARM and appropriate levels of PEEP remained controversial [5, 43\u201345]. Although Zaky et al. proved that applying PEEP and regular ARM during general anaesthesia improved aeration of the lungs, results of the PROVHILO Trial suggested that OLA strategy with a high level of PEEP and regular ARM during open abdominal surgery does not protect against PPC, or even may worsen outcomes due to an increased risk of intraoperative hypotension and higher vasopressor requirements [46, 47]. Additionally, Ferrando et al. compared three types of individualized OLA strategies to standard LPV in a multicentre RCT in Spain. They have not found any difference on outcomes between the OLA strategies, however PEEP had to be increased in 14% of patients in the standard LPV group due to intraoperative hypoxaemia [48].",

Titrating PEEP to achieve individual optimal levels has a strong pathophysiological rationale with potential benefits. Spadaro et al. found that the increased pulmonary shunt induced by general anaesthesia may be reduced only with the use of higher PEEP levels during laparoscopic surgery as compared to open abdominal surgery [23]. Liu and colleagues found significantly improved oxygenation, pulmonary function and reduced incidence of PPC after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy with the use of intraoperative decremental titrated individual PEEP [52]. However, it should not be forgotten that PEEPopt is rather a compromise than a realistic goal due to the heterogenous regional distribution of ventilation and compliance of the lungs. A PEEP that is appropriate in one region may be harmful in another one: in non-dependent lung parts overinflation can occur, in dependent parts atelectasis may develop [53, 54]. Maisch et al. defined PEEPopt as the PEEP that prevents atelectasis after ARM and minimizes alveolar dead space ventilation without over-distension [55].",

            "text": "There are several types of PEEP titration methods in order to determine the individual PEEPopt. Static or dynamic pulmonary compliance directed methods, Vds/Vt guided technique based on volumetric capnography or electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and transpulmonary pressure directed PEEP titration procedures are worth to mention [56\u201359]. Most authors agree that decremental titration should be performed, however, there is no recommendation about best practice. Pereira et colleagues found that EIT guided PEEP individualization could reduce PPC while improving intraoperative oxygenation and reducing \u0394P as well, causing minimal side effects [51]. Another Spanish RCT by Ferrando et al. suggested that individualized PEEP settings with the use of ARM may confer an enhanced lung protection in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery [60]. Additionally, in two Italian physiological studies conducted by D\u2019Antini and Rauseo in 2018, OLA applying titrated optimal PEEP levels resulted in improved respiratory mechanics, better gas exchange, decreased transpulmonary pressures and \u0394P without significant haemodynamic effects [24, 25]. Reducing \u0394P as a goal of ventilatory settings has some rationale: decreased lung stress and strain may attenuate intrapulmonary inflammatory response [61, 62].",

On the other hand, injurious intraoperative ventilatory management may cause further complications by exacerbating the local intrapulmonary inflammation and amplifying the surgery induced inflammatory response [8].
