Patients were then triaged into one of three pathways:1)Telemedicine: Patients with non-urgent/non-emergent inpatient issues were managed with telemedicine consultation composed of chart review and discussion with primary team providers, with or without patient telephone interview (depending upon patient's clinical status). These patients could be COVID-19 positive, suspected or negative.2)Standard: Patients with urgent/emergent inpatient needs but not proven/suspected COVID-19 positive had standard Urology consultation (though still minimizing the number of urology residents and/or attendings involved in direct patient care).3)High-risk: Patients with urgent/emergent inpatient needs who were suspected/proven COVID-19 positive were deemed High-risk urology consultations (seen by only one urology resident and/or attending, especially if a bedside procedure or operative intervention was necessary). PPE were donned, including N95 masks, per CDC and hospital policy.\n",
