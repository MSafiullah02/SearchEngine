            "text": "Anesthesiologists across the United States have a rich history in critical care that spans more than 60 years. The American Board of Anesthesiology first offered certification in critical care in 1986. 1 This development followed an unsuccessful attempt to create a unified board certification process for all critical care physicians from various backgrounds including anesthesiology, internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery. 1, 2 Since this introduction of board certification, the particpiation of anesthesiologists in critical care has not kept pace with other specialists from emergency medicine, internal medicine, and surgery who have expanded their role in adult critical care including cardiothoracic critical care:. [1] [2] [3] This lack of growth prompted concerns about the future of anesthesiologists in critical care both in the 1990's and early in the new millenium. 1;3 It is likley that the participation of anesthesiologists in critical care throughout the United States continues to be highly variable depending on multiple factors including gender, opportunities and location. [4] [5] [6] The current coornavirus pandemic and its catastrophic consequences have highlighted the imperative for anesthesiologists to be key stakeholders in critical care. 7 In areas hit by the full intensity of the pandemic, anesthesiologists have converted post-anesthesiology care units into intensive care units, deployed anesthesia machines as ventilators, and created acute care teams to address the unique challenges of clincial care in this setting, including airway management. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Beyond direct clinical care in the frontlines of the pandemic, anesthesiologists are also leading operations for surge planning, educating physicians about ventilator management, and designing guidelines for sedation and analgesia in patients with COVID-19. [10] [11] [12] As of 2018, less than 4% of anesthesiologists in the United States had board certification in critical care. 13 As a comparison, over 10% of were board certified in pain medicine and 6% were board certified in pediatric anesthesiology. 13 Although low, there has been some growth in in the prevalence of anesthesiologists who are board certified in critical care in the past 25 years, given that in 1986 less than 2% of anesthesiologists had subspecialty certification in critical care. 13 The focus on critical care due to the coronavirus pandemic might further stimulate an inteest in board certification in this specialty, given the inspiring roles of anesthesiologists in leading and providing care on the frontlines. 14 Table 1 ). Notably, a major themes is the ongoing expansion of critical care anesthesiologists into cardiothoracic critical care with concomitant integration of extracorporeal membrane oxygentation into the practice of perioperative medicine. [14] [15] As the coronavirus crisis continues, the roles of anesthesiologists outside the operating room environment will expand and add value across their halth systems. The response to the crisis will likely grow the roles of anesthesiologists in critical care, including the cardiothoracic arena. It will remain important to harmonize this growth with developments in the critical care landscape, including calls for refined training certification requirements. 21 Furthermore, there are also opportunities for adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology to learn from the European experience in fellowship development as the evolution in this subspecialty continues. 22 The challenges ahead for fellowships in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology include board certification and better integration with cardiothoracic critical care. [23] [24] This dynamic interface between cardiothoracic anesthesiology and critical care offers multiple opportunities for both subspecialites to harmonize, to thrive and to strengthen their clinical impact and delivered value.",

            "text": "-17 This possible surge in demand for fellowship trianing in adult critical care could be met by the steady growth in fellowship opportunities across the United Stattes. 18 According to the statistics from the San Francisco Match, the number of critical care fellowships in the United States has grown by 21.3% from 47 programs in 2014 to 57 programs in 2018. 18 The number of fellowship posiitons offered has also grown accordingly by 39.3% from 150 positions in 2014 to 209 positions in 2018. 18 This growth has also occurred in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology with a 22.2% increase in programs from 54 in 2014 to 66 in 2018. 19 The number of fellowship positions in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology has also increaed by 33.3% from 168 positions in 2014 to 224 positions in 2018. 19 The growing interest in cardiothoracic critical care may also be boosted by the pandemic, thereby encouraging aspiring fellows to train both in critical care and cardiothoracic anesthesiology at a time when capacity is higher than ever before. 20 Recently, we performed an electronic survey of leaders in academic anesthesiology departments in conjunction with the Society of Academic Associations of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine. In this survey, greater than 75% (23/30) of respondents noted that a critical care anesthesiologist held a system-wide leadership position at their respective institutions. These positions included chief operating officer, senior vice president, and chair for critical care medicine in their respective hospitals. Furthermore, all respondents viewed having an anesthesiology presence within adult critical care medicine as positive. Respondents were mixed upon the financial implications of anesthesiologists practicing critical care with 23.3% (7/30) stating that it required additional financial support, 30% (9/30) stating that it garnered additional revenue, and 46.7% (14/30) having a neutral position. Upon completion of the survey, respondents also described their vision for critical care within anesthesiology. From a total of 23 free text responses, 5 major themes could be defined as follows: further encouragement of resident interest; greater expansion into cardiothoracic critical care; the importance of critical care to the future of anesthesiology; the priority for greater support and recognition; and boosted ownership in critical care medicine by anesthesiologists (refer to",
