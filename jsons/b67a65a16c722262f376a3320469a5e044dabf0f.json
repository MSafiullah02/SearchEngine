This evolution of care toward greater medical and operational complexity necessitated changes to both the structure and organization of cardiovascular ICUs, and the training and skills of critical care cardiologists.

It is important to identify any bottlenecks throughout the system. Although a comprehensive review is well beyond the scope of this manuscript, resources are publicly available. (16, 17) Herein, we describe potential adaptive CICU staffing, organizational structure, medical treatment, and regional care pathways. Recognizing that they frequently practice in tertiary-care CICUs and routinely care for patients with primary cardiovascular diagnoses complicated by multi-system organ injury, (18) critical care cardiologists are arguably well-positioned to take a leading role in hospital-and Similarly, hospitals that have historically admitted non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) to a CICU or ICU will need to transition stable patients to telemetryenabled wards in keeping with more contemporary guideline recommendations. (27) Opening more CICU beds to COVID-19-afflicted patients will necessitate additional changes to operational workflow, including daily care rounds and diagnostic testing. (9) The traditional CICU philosophy is to concentrate intense resources, simultaneously addressing all active issues of a critically ill patient. During the COVID-19 crisis, however, a more utilitarian approach must be utilized, evaluating operations on the basis of efficiency, equity, and justice for patients and the hospital system as a whole. Routine laboratory studies and daily chest radiographs, for instance, that may offer low clinical value relative to the costs associated with health care worker and patient exposure should be re-considered and potentially eliminated. (28) Analogously, the use of comprehensive echocardiography should be limited to those situations where full imaging is essential, replaced instead by more focused study protocols using handheld devices performed by physicians already examining their patients. (29) Indeed, the very nature of CICU team-based, bedside rounds may need to change in order to facilitate social distancing. We suggest that physician-patient contact be minimized and that rounds be re-engineered with technological links to facilitate distanced discussions between the care team whenever possible.(9) Furthermore, to prevent patient-to-patient spread, it may be reasonable to structure rounds temporally so that providers can examine individuals without COVID-19 before approaching those with suspected or confirmed illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "(16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 442, "end": 445, "text": "17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 750, "end": 754, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2128, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Proposed CICU Workforce and Staffing Re-Organization Strategies"}, {"text": "In order to meet ICU surge capacity, new ICU environments will need to be created in some institutions.

In Barcelona and Madrid, for instance, hotels have been re-purposed as medical facilities for lower-risk patients, and have also been used to accommodate health care workers who do not have the means to safely isolate themselves at home.

Access to health care and clinical resources -including diagnostic tools, hospital beds, a healthy workforce, personal protective equipment (PPE), and advanced critical care modalities such as renal replacement therapies and ventilators -are now limited, and in some instances scarce due to the impact of the current pandemic. This virus shows no favoritism; while older patients with medical comorbidities are at the greatest risk for death and disability,(1) emerging evidence suggests that increasing numbers of young and seemingly healthy individuals have been hospitalized and may continue to succumb to coronavirus-associated complications.(2) SARS-CoV-2, the causative respiratory pathogen, can injure most organ systems -many critically ill patients with COVID-19, in fact, will develop concomitant cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, or hepatic dysfunction.(3) In some cases, acute cardiac injury will be an important manifestation and the predominant cause of clinical deterioration.(4) Management of a disruptive illness like COVID-19 therefore calls for disruptive health care adaptations and innovations, particularly when treating the highest risk critical care cohorts.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "These systems could place additional pressure on hub hospitals experiencing a COVID-19 pandemic surge, particularly given that COVID-19 is associated with significant cardiovascular sequelae.(9) The ability to accept transfers from spoke facilities may be severely limited at this time, but critical care cardiologists can remain a valuable resource for these centers by providing remote guidance.Current pandemic preparations have highlighted the need for increased regional collaboration and cooperation between public and private institutions, academic and community hospitals, individual healthcare systems, and local, state, and federal government entities. Given that many state governments have already mandated the cancellation of elective procedures, hospital systems must plan to utilize less impacted facilities within their networks to help ease both ICU and CICU capacity strain. As highlighted inFigure 1, this strategy may include repatriation of convalescing patients and decanting of low-to-intermediate risk patients to community sites, while patients with higher acuity primary cardiac presentations or COVID-19 cardiac complications would be transferred to better resourced and higher volume centers. In addition, regional cooperation can improve the management of the critical care supply chain. As shortages of PPE continue, local governments have pressured their national counterparts to assist in securing supplies historically obtained by individual hospitals. As of April 1, 2020, the state of Ohio began mandatory reporting of all ventilators and respiratory equipment to a centralized database.(34) The regional government in Catalonia, Spain has done the same.

In addition, institutions have made profound procedural and structural alterations, including the suspension of elective procedures and the retro-fitting of existing clinical spaces. These adaptations align with established disaster and mass casualty (MASCAL) care plans often used in military medicine.CICU providers, like military medicine practitioners, may be compelled into \"battle\" against COVID-19 with limited resources and will need to adapt to challenges using both innovation and ingenuity. The strategic objectives of military medicine -honed over decades of experience with mass casualties -offer a blueprint for CICUs and critical care cardiologists to rise to the many challenges of the current pandemic.(35)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "of lifesaving interventions with the highest chance of survival. Although seemingly impersonal, these criteria may be imperative when necessary resources are either scarce or absent.(37) This will be a difficult shift in practice for many medical professionals, but several states have recently adopted -in consultation with medical ethicists and based upon principles of distributive justice -guidelines on ventilator allocation that can be extrapolated to other invasive and resource-intensive interventions.(38) Anecdotally, this has been done internationally as well.Under this framework, all patients requiring ventilation are ranked in tiers based upon illness acuity, likelihood of survival-to-discharge, and the possibility of long-term survival. Resources are then distributed top down based on availability. Unlike strict age or comorbidity restrictions, this model allows for the ethical application of resources and provides the flexibility necessary for day-to-day care. Utilizing this framework, clinical decisions can be made by a multidisciplinary group or individual provider based on medical expertise, patient demographic, health system capacity strain, and the accessibility of resources. Development of consistently applied institutional triage protocols should also be considered for resource-intensive life-saving procedures which involve a high risk for health care worker exposure and may have limited utility, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "limited availability of intensive care beds has even led to the provision of acute care therapies in non-ICU settings.(41) Colleagues from high-impact COVID-19 centers have already called upon the cardiovascular community to take proactive measures.(42) Critical care cardiologists and other CICU practitioners, particularly if called upon to staff other COVID-19-specific ICUs, can take a proactive role in helping to educate providers that may have limited experience or expertise in the management of critically ill cardiac patients. We propose several potential avenues by which CICU leaders can educate others. First, simulation-based training has long been an effective way to teach ICU skills, including procedural competency (e.g. central line placement, ventilator management, and point-of-care ultrasonography) and promote interdisciplinary communication.(43) Second, the creation of care pathways, order sets, and protocols for providers in the ICU can help to reduce clinical ambiguity, promote best practices, and enhance resource conservation.(44) These may be particularly important for providers less experienced in the complex ICU environment. Similarly, parsimonious intensive care checklists may be useful and have been shown to improve patient safety and reduce errors.(45) Third, avenues for rapid communication and dissemination of information must be developed.
