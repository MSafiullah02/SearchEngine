These compounds can form H-bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. Although the aromatic ring in 1,2,3-triazoles is fairly stable, it becomes more reactive when bonded to electronegative groups. For example, 1,2,3-triazole can form 1-CF3-1,2,3-triazole, which decomposes at approximately 170 \u00b0C and generates highly reactive intermediates.40 In addition, triazoles are weakly acidic and weakly basic. They are rarely oxidised but may tautomerise to 2H-1,2,3-triazoles. They are more sensitive to reducing agents. Furthermore, several other properties including strong dipole moments of the triazole system, bioisosteric effects,41 and the nature of the heteroatoms all make triazole units an important scaffold in medicinal chemistry.",

The most potent derivative 1 (Fig. 3\n) (HCT116, IC50 = 0.43 \u00b5M) that exhibited almost 11.5-fold potency than Melampomagnolide B (HCT116, IC50 = 4.93 \u00b5M), did not affect normal cells (FHC, HPDE6-C7, 3T3), and significantly induced apoptosis as well as inhibition of proliferation and migration of cancer cell lines. The effect of 1 on HCT116 cell migration was measured using the Transwell assay and the number of migrated cells was distinctly lower after exposure to melampomagnolide B-triazole 1 for 48 h. In addition, the expression of epithelial proteins such us snail, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and E-cadherin, as well as mesenchymal marker proteins such as vimentin, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and N-cadherin was productively decreased after treatment with derivative 1, which confirmed that triazole compound 1 may inhibit and affect the migration of HCT116 cells. Another melampomagnolide B-triazole conjugate, compound 2 (Fig. 3), was effective and potent against several cancer cell lines including leukaemia (GI50 = 0.10\u20130.23 \u00b5M), colon (GI50 = 0.14\u20131.17 \u00b5M), melanoma (GI50 = 0.15\u20131.47 \u00b5M), renal (GI50 = 0.02\u20130.70 \u00b5M), ovarian (GI50 = 0.15\u20131.86 \u00b5M), prostate (GI50 = 0.72\u20130.83 \u00b5M), and breast (GI50 = 0.17\u20131.03 \u00b5M) cancer cell line subpanels.46 Further investigation indicated that triazole compound 2 was a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kB and cell proliferation in TMD-231 (MDA-MB-231) cell line. Moreover, treatment of TMD-231 cells with derivative 2 decreased the DNA binding activity of NF-kB by inhibiting p65 phosphorylation mediated by inhibitor of NF-kB kinase (IKK)-b and increasing basal IkB\u03b1 levels via inhibition of substantial NF-kB activation and IkB\u03b1 turnover.",

The target lead (6, Fig. 3) showed significant activity on HCT116 cells (IC50 = 5.19 \u00b5M). Moreover, this triterpene saponin triazole derivative demonstrated favourable selectivity, and was effective on multidrug resistance (MDR) cancer cells where it induced ferroptosis and apoptosis as a p53 activator via the mitochondrial pathway. In vivo investigations revealed that the introduction of the triazole fragment into the triterpene skeleton considerably inhibited tumorigenesis without causing toxicity against normal cells (for 6). Indeed, this study provided clinical evidence to support the consideration of the albiziabioside A derivative 6 as a potential cancer drug candidate with enhanced activity, and further information on its novel mechanism of action. Another series of 1,2,3-triazole-linked saponin hederacolchiside A1 with aryl/amide portion were synthesised to improve the inhibitory activity, metabolic stability, and comprehensively determine the pharmacological mechanism.51 The antiproliferative activities of the synthesised analogues were assayed on six types of human cancer cell lines, PC3, HT29, HepG2, A549, HL60, and U937 cell lines. The results revealed that most of the synthesised hybrids with the para- and meta-substituents demonstrated strong cytotoxicity towards HL60 and U937 cells. In particular, derivative 7 (Fig. 3) showed strong anticancer potential against all selected cells compare with the positive controls 5-fluorouracil and hederacolchiside A1.

This triazole hybrid induced apoptosis and was strongly cytotoxic to BL2, RS4;11, and H929 cells at rates of 93, 75.5, and 37.5, and 20.5%, respectively in Remb1 cells.54 Here, it should be noted that the selected target proteins such as Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-xL), myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl-1), and Bcl-2 and their interaction between new triazole hybrids were screened using fluorescence polarisation, and the results indicated that modulation of the lateral chain dramatically affected the compound by considerably modifying its activity on target proteins. Other triazole-natural compound hybrids, triterpene derivative-linked 1,2,3-triazole moieties were prepared and their anticancer potentials were investigated on the selected cancer cells such as C-32, T47D, and SNB-19 using the WST-1 assay.55 Hybrid derivative 11 (Fig. 3) displayed a significant IC50 value (0.17 \u00b5M) toward the human glioblastoma SNB-19 cell line, which was nearly 5-fold higher that the value of the reference drug cisplatin.",

Peptide 51 (Fig. 7) demonstrated activity against all selected gram-negative bacterial strains. However, macrocycle 51 exhibited a 2-fold lower inhibition of EcLepB (IC50 = 175 nM) than other synthesised triazole-peptides whereas, in contrast, macrocycle 51 exhibited a 2-fold stronger antibacterial potency. In addition, peptides were also screened against HepG2 cells to evaluate the cytotoxicity and haemolytic potential in human blood. The results indicated that for compound 51, the cytotoxicity was decreased (8 \u00b5M) while the haemolysis was halved (10.6%).

In this study, the most potent compound was 133 (Fig. 21), which displayed superior suppression of hDHODH with an IC50 of 2.1 \u00b5M. The immunosuppression assay revealed that 133 also potently inhibited proliferation of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

Results showed that compound 134 (Fig. 21) specifically targets Na,K-ATPase \u03b14. The activity of the lead derivative 134 was determined in rat sperm Vm, pH, and [Ca2+]i. The prepared cell samples were treated in the presence and absence of 10\u22128 M 134 for 1 h, and sperm Vm, pH, and [Ca2+]i were measured using various fluorophores and derivative 134 caused sperm plasma membrane depolarisation, escalating Vm by almost 40%, causing intracellular sperm acidification. Overall, except for the decreased ability of sperm to swim and reach the egg, 134 demonstrated decreased hyperactivity of sperm movability. All the above potential activities of 134 could serve in the future development of drug candidates for male contraception.",

Among these agents, compound 135 (Fig. 21) was selected for its high affinity as an orally bioavailable inhibitor of autotaxin. The lead 135 concentration-dependently inhibited autotaxin and the formation of LPA in vivo when used at 0.3 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats. A robust decrease in all four LPA levels was observed, with the peak reduction of approximately 70\u201380%, which was in agreement with the Cmax of 135.",

            "text": "In conclusion, lead compounds containing the 1,2,3-triazole moiety will serve as effective drug candidates in their current forms or following appropriate chemical and biological modifications in future. Indeed, the developments in Cu-AAC have generated 1,2,3-triazole-hybrids with a broad profile of activities. The present review shows that most synthesised triazoles have favoured activities in which these motifs not only acted as a linker, showing CH-\u03c0 interaction between the 1,2,3-triazole and enzymes, but also directed the appropriate side-rings (the fused ring in the triazole hybrid system) to the binding sites of enzymes or amino acids. These properties of triazoles in the hybrid molecules make them a unique motif that is an important factor in drug design and delivery. Although the selectivity and solubility of the most common triazole-hybrids have been well improved, the in vivo assay results indicate that further developments are needed. There should also be a focus on fused 1,2,3-triazole heterocyclic compounds, because triazole linkers have been well studied and their mechanism of action is clear. For example, we propose that if a 1,2,3-triazole ring was inserted instead of the imidazole portion in the purine skeleton, this type of fused pyrimidines may exhibit interesting properties for medicinal chemistry. In addition, the present review indicated that a proportion of studies have been dedicated to coumarin modification using Cu-AAC method. In the future, we believe there will be further elucidation of 1,2,3-triazole chemistry and biology, which would facilitate the development of 1,2,3-triazole-based lead compounds with lower toxicity and higher selectivity.",
