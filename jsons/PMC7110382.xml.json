Toxic or ischemic hepatic injury is the cause of >90% of cases of acute hepatic injury with AST activity >3000 U/L (43). In both ischemic and acetaminophen hepatic injury, AST and ALT activities typically peak early (often in the first 24 h after admission) with AST activity initially higher than that of ALT. After peaking, activities of both fall rapidly. AST may fall by 50% or more in the first 24 h (40)(41), and it declines more rapidly than ALT because of its shorter half-life (3); AST activity reaches near normal values an average of 7 days after injury (2). PT is >4 s above the reference limits in 90% of cases (26)(27) and falls rapidly after peak AST is reached (26). Bilirubin is <34 \u03bcmol/L (2 mg/dL) in 80% of cases of toxic or ischemic injury (26)(27)(42). Lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) activity often is higher than that of AST at presentation in toxic or ischemic hepatic injury (26)(40)(41), whereas it is increased on initial determination in only 55% of cases of viral hepatitis, with average values being only slightly above the upper reference limit (3). Rarely, cocaine may cause hepatic injury, usually in patients with coexisting hypotension (44).",

Several viruses other than the classical agents [HAV, HBV, HCV, and hepatitis E virus (HEV)] have been associated with hepatitis, including herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus, coronavirus, reovirus (in neonates), adenovirus, parvovirus B6 (in pediatric populations), varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Syphilis, leptospirosis, and toxoplasmosis also may cause hepatic injury, as may other less common infectious agents. Rarely, other disorders, including lymphoma, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and venoocclusive disease, may present with a picture of acute hepatic injury. In general, hepatic injury associated with these etiologies either is unusual or is associated with a specific syndrome (chicken pox with varicella-zoster virus, mononucleosis with EBV, or CMV). Most patients with other infectious causes of hepatic injury have signs and symptoms that suggest a particular agent as the cause. Specific diagnosis of infection by other agents should be pursued when the etiology remains unknown after more common causes are excluded and when establishment of a specific diagnosis appears clinically indicated. Superinfection with other hepatitis viruses may occur in a patient with other forms of hepatic injury; for example, patients with chronic HCV or alcoholic hepatitis may become infected with either HAV or HBV and develop an acute hepatitis as a result of the superimposed infection. In chronic hepatitis, an acute increase in aminotransferases mimicking acute hepatic injury can occur with clearance of HBV e antigen (HBeAg) (45) or with emergence of quasispecies of HCV (46).",

Activities tend to fall slowly in viral hepatitis and alcoholic hepatitis: AST and ALT decrease, on average, 11.7% and 10.5% per day, respectively, and remain increased 22 \u00b1 16 and 27 \u00b1 16 days, respectively (3). In hepatitis A, a secondary increase in enzymes occurs in 5\u201310% of cases before activities return to baseline and is associated with circulating HAV RNA and viral particles in stool, indicating a potential for transmission of infection (48)(49)(50). As discussed above, AST and ALT fall rapidly after reaching peak activities in ischemic and toxic hepatic injury. In all forms of hepatic injury, decreasing activities occur both with recovery and with massive necrosis, making enzyme activity a poor indicator of recovery (20). Once aminotransferases have shown a consistent pattern of decrease, they need not be checked again until the patient has clinically recovered. Return of aminotransferases to normal is not a reliable sign of recovery in hepatitis B or C. In patients with chronic HCV infection, 49% with normal ALT at the initial visit after seroconversion developed increased ALT on subsequent follow-up (51). In hepatitis B, AST and ALT may return to normal despite persistence of infection (52)(53).",

The vast majority of cases are produced by one of two point mutations of the HFE gene on chromosome 6. The majority (60\u201390%) of affected individuals are homozygous for the C282Y (845A) mutation, whereas a minority has compound heterozygosity for this mutation and the H63D (187G) mutation (84)(85). Screening involves detection of increased transferrin saturation (saturation = serum iron \u00d7 100/total iron-binding capacity) (86) or low unsaturated iron-binding capacity (87). A transferrin saturation cutoff of \u226545% or unsaturated iron-binding capacity cutoff \u226428 \u03bcmol/L (155 \u03bcg/dL) has a sensitivity of 90\u2013100% for homozygosity for the C282Y mutation; if fasting specimens are used, the specificity is 43% (88)(89). A recent consensus conference recommended that definitive diagnosis be made by genetic analysis (90). Although several recent publications have shown the feasibility of hemochromatosis screening using transferrin saturation, most organizations and researchers do not currently recommend screening because of unresolved issues regarding their ability to convince young adults to be tested, the specificity and reproducibility of screening tests, and questions about natural history of untreated disease (90)(91)(92). Screening has been advocated by the College of American Pathologists (93), and has been estimated to save $3.19 per blood donor screened (94).",

It is caused by a mutation of a gene on chromosome 13 coding for an ATPase needed for copper transport (95). Wilson disease may present as liver disease, neurologic problems, or with psychiatric symptoms, almost always before age 40. Most patients who present with liver disease do not have neurologic manifestations (96). The most common diagnostic finding is low plasma ceruloplasmin. Low concentrations also occur with malnutrition, protein loss, and advanced liver disease, and falsely normal values can occur with pregnancy, estrogen administration, and acute inflammation (97). Most references report low ceruloplasmin in 95% of homozygotes and 20% of heterozygotes (97)(98)(99). One study found normal ceruloplasmin in 35% of patients with chronic liver disease attributable to Wilson disease (confirmed by genetic studies in 80%) but in only 15% of patients with Wilson disease without overt liver involvement (96). Other expected findings in Wilson disease include increased serum free copper, decreased total serum copper, increased urine copper excretion, and increased liver copper content. These tests may also provide misleading results in patients with Wilson disease (96)(100). Multiple tests frequently are needed to establish the diagnosis.",

Type 1, found primarily in young and middle-aged women, is the most common form; it is associated with high titers of ANA and/or anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA). Type 2, found primarily in children, is common in western Europe but rare in the United States; it is associated with antibodies to liver-kidney microsomal antigen, but rarely with positive ANA or ASMA. Many patients with type 2 also have HCV infection. Type 3, found primarily in young women, is associated with systemic autoimmune disease in many cases. Most affected individuals lack ANA, ASMA, or anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies, but are positive for antibodies for soluble liver antigen. Standardized diagnostic criteria and a scoring system have been defined by an international panel (103). The classic features of the most common type 1 include increased aminotransferases; minimal or no increases in ALP; polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (at least 1.5 times the upper reference limit); no evidence of viral infection, risk factors for viral infection, or exposure to drugs or alcohol; and positive ANA or ASMA (at least 1:80) (103). Approximately 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection have a positive ANA or ASMA, usually in low titers (102). False-positive anti-HCV results have been reported in 60% of patients with AIH when second-generation tests are used, and in 20% when third-generation assays are used (104); anti-HCV typically disappears with successful treatment (105). In equivocal cases, HCV RNA (or a recombinant immunoblot assay) can be used to establish the diagnosis (104).",

Although PBC and PSC characteristically cause increases in ALP and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2), patients with these diseases may have increased AST and ALT and be considered to have chronic hepatitis. PBC is associated with destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts; it is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, particularly Sjogren syndrome (up to 80% of cases) (106). An autoimmune marker, anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), is found in almost all patients with PBC; although other diseases may be associated with positive AMA, in PBC the antibody is directed against the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (so-called M2 type of AMA), particularly to dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and E3-binding protein (107). Approximately 5\u201310% of patients have features of both PBC and AIH (108)(109). PBC often is detected in asymptomatic individuals by a finding of increased ALP. AST and ALT are increased in approximately one-half of cases, although values are more than two times the reference limit in 20% (110). PSC is associated with damage to both intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts; 70% of cases are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) (111). Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are found in approximately two-thirds of all cases (112). In PSC, antibodies commonly are directed against bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, cathepsin G, and/or lactoferrin. There appears to be no prognostic significance to the different antibody specificities, although patients with cirrhosis more commonly have antibody to multiple antigens and to antigens other than lactoferrin (113). ASMA and ANA are also present in up to 70% of cases (114).",

The gene for A1AT is located on chromosome 14 (115); deficiency is usually attributable to a single amino acid substitution that alters carbohydrate binding and impairs release from hepatocytes (116). The most important deficiency involves homozygosity for the Z variant, termed Pi (for protease inhibitor) ZZ. Deficiency is associated with emphysema and neonatal hepatitis (117); chronic hepatic injury with cirrhosis and HCC (118) have also been reported. Almost all Pi ZZ neonates have evidence of liver injury at birth; this usually resolves by age 12 years (117). In adults, 50% of Pi Z-positive individuals (either homozygotes or heterozygotes) develop cirrhosis, and 31% develop HCC (116). There is also an excess of Pi Z heterozygotes among patients referred for liver transplants, particularly among patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, where \u223c25% of patients are Pi Z positive (119). There is evidence, however, that A1AT deficiency or heterozygosity for Pi Z phenotype may not directly cause liver disease, but increase susceptibility to liver damage by other agents, especially viruses. Two controlled studies found the same frequency of Pi Z (either homozygous or heterozygous) in patients with liver disease and controls (120)(121). In a study of 164 patients with Pi Z, 40% had chronic liver disease; 87% were also positive for HCV antibodies or HBV markers, and only 11% had no other liver disease risk factors (122). Because A1AT is an acute phase reactant, quantitative concentrations may be falsely normal with infection or inflammation, and falsely low concentrations may occur with malnutrition, protein-losing states, or end stage liver disease. In one study, quantitative concentrations were normal in 42% of heterozygous Pi Z patients with liver disease (123). Testing for A1AT deficiency should use phenotype analysis rather than quantitative plasma concentration (116).",
