An animal dying from anthrax contains naturally-produced anthrax spores. When inhaled, ingested, or in contact with a skin lesion, spores may become active and multiply rapidly. Effective vaccines against anthrax are available and anthrax can be controlled with antibiotics. The US and other nations researched anthrax bacteria that are immune to antibiotics. A dose of 10,000 anthrax spores can be lethal, while plague needs only 500 organisms. Implementing safe handling of Anthrax has had logistic problems.

The CWC verification regime is discussed in Sect. 15.4, but for now we note the fact that the chemical industry is less vulnerable to loss of industrial secrets in CWC as compared to the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries in the BWC. Biotechnology is driven strongly by high technology research, as compared to the mass-production of chemicals. The pharmaceutical and biomedical industries did not support the draft BWC verification protocol for this reason. It will be difficult to devise an effective BWC monitoring regime without the loss of some bio-industrial trade-secrets. But, the international community should keep trying to develop a BWC monitoring regime. In the meantime, partial measures can be adopted to strengthen BW declarations by enhancing transparency between nations with confidence-building measures. This can improve implementation of the BWC.",
