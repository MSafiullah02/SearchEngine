            "text": "Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) causes considerable economic losses in pig production and the disease has been associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infections (Allan et al., 1999a). Under experimental conditions, the reproduction of PMWS in pigs infected with PCV2 alone was difficult to achieve, and PCV2 infected pigs developed only mild to moderate PMWS specific lesions (Balasch et al., 1999; Krakowka et al., 2000). Serological studies showed that antibodies directed against PCV2 were detected in pigs of more than 94% of the Dutch pig herds (Elbers and de Jong, 2002), but not all PCV2 infected pigs will develop PMWS. This indicated that the course of most PCV2 infections is more or less sub-clinical and that PCV2 may need co-factors to fully reproduce PMWS. Data from experimental co-infections with porcine parvovirus (PPV) (Allan et al., 1999b; Ellis et al., 2000; Krakowka et al., 2000) or PRRSV (Harms et al., 2001) supported this theory. Furthermore, the stimulation of the immune system might be a pivotal event in the production of PMWS in PCV2 infected pigs (Krakowka et al., 2001), although contradictory data have also been generated regarding this subject (Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al., 2002).",

Most of these lesions were characterised histologically by infiltration of mononuclear cells often in combination with the presence of giant cells. Interstitial pneumonia with bronchovasculo-interstitial infiltrations of leukocytes was a dominant histopathological finding in pigs with clinical signs of PMWS.

However, in controls the course of the PCV2 infection was more or less sub-clinical, or resulted in only mild to moderate macroscopic lesions. Not all PCV2 infected pigs will develop severe clinical signs as described for PMWS. This suggests that certain co-factors modulate the severity of PCV2 infections. Our case-control study, which was also performed to get more insights in which co-factors might play a role in development of clinical signs as described for PMWS, showed that, except for PRRSV, no clear differences were found in the frequencies of PCV1, PPV, TGEV, PEDV, PRCV, H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 infections between cases and controls from PMWS-free herds. Also others reported the occurrence of concurrent infections of PCV2 and PRRSV in PMWS affected pigs (Sorden et al., 1998; Segal\u00e9s et al., 2002). Rovira et al. (2002) showed that a concurrent infection of PCV2 and PRRSV could result in increased PCV2 viral copy numbers, and that PRRSV infections enhanced PCV2 replication. The PCV2 load in serum was higher in pigs PRRSV inoculated one week before PCV2 challenge, than in pigs inoculated with PCV2 only. Studies from Rovira et al. (2002), this case-control study and the PCV2-PRRSV experimental infection study (Stockhofe-Zurwieden et al., 2003) all support the hypothesis that PRRSV can be an important predisposing factor to the development of PMWS under experimental and field conditions.",

A high frequency of co-infections with different types of PRRSV in herds with clinical signs of PMWS has not been reported before, and therefore it might be of interest in the further research for co-factors involved in the development of PMWS. In most case herds, vaccines against PRRSV were used. But according to our opinion, the use of vaccines in case herds had no influences on our data concerning the reported frequencies of PRRSV infections and on the frequencies of concurrent co-infections of EU- and US-type PRRSV as found in cases and controls. This conclusion is based on: (a) the sequences within regions of ORF-6 and ORF-7 from EU- and US-type PRRSV strains found in cases and control pigs were not similar to the (modified)-live virus strains used in PRRSV-vaccines (data not shown), (b) the detection of PRRSV ELISA antibodies in pigs older than 8\u20139 weeks indicates an active immune response to PRRSV (Nodelijk et al., 1997), and (c) also the detection of PRRSV RNA in pigs at this age indicates an acute PRRSV infection.

However, in 8 case herds with severe clinical cases of PMWS only the US-type PRRSV in combination with EU- and/or US-type PRRSV antibodies were detected. As far as we know we had no PRRSV-US strains in the Netherlands at the beginning of the '90. Also new PRRSV-EU variants with increased pathogenicity might have been responsible for new epizootics within the Dutch pig populations and might have contributed to an increase of reported PMWS cases. Mutations in strains of EU- or US-type PRRSV can result in co-infections of new PRRSV strains with different phenotypes within herds, or even within the same pig. The appearance of quasi-species, and emergence of a PRRSV sub-population during infection in pigs has been reported (Rowland et al., 1999). Subsequently, mutations within the PRRSV genome can be responsible for a reduced but also for an increased virulence (Allende et al., 2000; Nielsen et al., 2001). Semen isolates from another Arterivirus, equine arteritis virus (EAV), seems generally of low pathogenicity but variants with increased pathogenicity might arise during secondary spread of the virus and are perhaps responsible for new epizootics (Timoney and McCollum, 1993). Harms et al. (2001) reported, besides PCV2, the detection of PRRSV strains with increased pathogenicity in swine with atypical PRRS in many Midwestern swine herds in the United States. Beginning in 1996, outbreaks of atypical PRRS often occurred in sow herds that had received multiple doses of modified live PRRSV vaccines (Harms et al., 2001). Whether the use of vaccines against PPRSV has any influence on the chance for the appearance of new PRRSV mutants is unknown.",

Although, most of the pigs within the clinically affected PMWS group showed histopathological lesions characteristic for PMWS, in lymph nodes from some of the pigs within this group, lesions consisted of hyperplasia often in combination with the presence of giant cells. As lymphoid hyperplasia is not a common feature of PMWS, some of the pigs within this group probably cannot be fully characterised as PMWS-affected, despite the presence of: (a) clinical signs as documented for PMWS, (b) histopathological lesions in e.g. lung and kidneys, and (c) the detection (high levels) of PCV2 in affected organs. Furthermore, concurrent PCV2 and PRRSV infections were recorded significantly more often in Dutch pigs with clinical signs than in healthy controls, and co-infections with both EU- and US-type PRRSV were detected very frequently in Dutch case herds.",
