            "text": "There is an increasingly recognized array of bacterial, parasitic and viral organisms associated with infection of the intestinal tract which can profoundly disrupt intestinal function with or without causing acute diarrhea. Acute diarrhea is a syndrome that is frequently not differentiated clinically by a specific etiologic agent. The wide spectrum of evolution varies from self-limited disease to death. Death is mainly due to dehydration and acute diarrhea takes the highest toll among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This chapter examines the viral and bacterial causes of acute diarrhea, clinically defined by three or more loose or watery stools per day or a definite decrease in consistency and increase in frequency based upon an individual baseline lasting for less than 2 weeks. Parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract will be presented in Section 6 and diarrhea associated with food poisoning is discussed in Chapter 37. Diarrhea associated with Clostridium difficile infection is covered in Chapter 40. When diarrhea lasts for 14 days it can be considered persistent; the term chronic generally refers to diarrhea that lasts for at least one month (see Chapter 39).",

The network observed that 6% of interviewed people reported an acute diarrheal illness during the 4 weeks preceding the interview, that is an annualized rate of 0.72 episodes per person-year. Rates of illness were highest among children younger than 5 years (1.1 episodes per person-year) and were lowest in persons aged \u226565 years (0.32 episodes per person-year).2 A study in 2000 that estimated the economic burden of both infectious and noninfectious gastrointestinal and liver disease in the USA found that the most prevalent diseases were non-food-borne gastroenteritis (135 million cases per year) and food-borne illness (76 million cases per year).3 A report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that food-borne diseases account for approximately 76 million illnesses, 325 000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths each year in the USA based upon surveillance data from multiple sources.4 In the Netherlands, the incidence of gastroenteritis was 45 per 100 person-years in a prospective study.5\n",

Less prevalent viruses include paramyxovirus, morbillivirus, rubivirus and reovirus. The prevalence of norovirus has been recently estimated to be 12% in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for severe diarrhea and 12% of mild and moderate diarrhea cases among patients of all ages.12 These authors estimated that noroviruses were responsible for up to 200 000 deaths of children <5 years of age in LMIC.12\n",

Water-borne outbreaks associated with recreational water (e.g., swimming or wading pools) are another source of acute diarrhea. These are associated most frequently with Cryptosporidium (50%) in treated water sources and with toxigenic E. coli (25%) and norovirus (25%) in freshwater sources.

In severe infectious diarrhea, the daily volume of stool may exceed 2 liters. Dehydration and loss of potassium (hypokalemia) are two life-threatening consequences of severe diarrhea. Water is mainly absorbed in the small bowel (about 8 liters a day in an adult) and further in the colon. By the time the initial 8 liters of fluid reaches the ileocecal valve, only about 600 mL remain, representing an efficiency of water absorption of 93%. By the time the remaining 600 mL of fluid reaches the anus, only about 100 mL of fluid remains, generally as formed feces. In the small intestine, water is absorbed by three basic mechanisms: \u2018neutral\u2019 sodium chloride (NaCl) absorption mediated by two coupled systems \u2013 one of which exchanges Na/H (cation exchanger), and the other exchanges Cl/HCO3 (anion exchanger); \u2018electrogenic\u2019 sodium absorption where sodium enters the cell via an electrochemical gradient \u2013 this electrogenic sodium absorption mechanism is commonly damaged during acute enteric infection; and sodium co-transport whereby sodium absorption is coupled to the absorption of organic solutes such as glucose, many amino acids and peptides. This co-transport mechanism remains intact during most acute diarrheal disorders. It is for this reason that oral rehydration is effective during acute diarrheal illness.",

Infections that damage the intestinal epithelial cells either directly (rotavirus) or by a toxin (Shigella spp.) cause malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea results from an active, toxin-mediated secretion of water into the gut lumen. This is observed during cholera, and infection by Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli and Shigella species. Rotavirus also produces a viral enterotoxin, the nonstructural glycoprotein (NSP4). Lastly, diarrhea can result from infection-mediated intestinal inflammation. After ingestion, an enteric organism colonizes the intestinal epithelium by adhering to enterocytes. One of two pathways are generally followed depending upon the offending organism, either mucosal invasion or production of an enterotoxin.",

Not only food animals such as poultry, cattle, sheep and pigs, but also domestic pets are reservoirs for worldwide human infection. Although the incidence is decreasing in the USA, Campylobacter species are still responsible for sporadic infections following improper handling of poorly cooked meat. Poultry is a major source of infection.14 Unpasteurized dairy products and water have been found to be sources for limited outbreaks. The incidence of infection with Campylobacter spp. is higher in LMIC than in industrialized nations and travelers to LMIC are at risk of Campylobacter infection. The pathogenesis of Campylobacter infections is poorly understood. C. jejuni and C. coli are the most frequently encountered species responsible for diarrhea. Signs and symptoms may vary from asymptomatic infections to include fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea with or without blood and fecal white blood cells. Although generally self-limiting, relapse with chronic diarrhea is possible as well as extraintestinal infection including bacter\u00ademia. C. jejuni infection is the most often recognized infection preceding the development of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.15 The mechanisms rely on the cross-reactivity between ganglioside-like motifs present in C. jejuni lipopolysaccharide and those of peripheral nerves. Also, this species has been associated with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.16 Species other than C. jejuni and C. coli are increasingly isolated from the stools of patients with diarrhea, including C. fetus, mainly isolated from extraintestinal sites, and C. upsaliensis. Both species being susceptible to cephalothin, an antibiotic usually incorporated in C. jejuni-selective media, their prevalence in stools and diarrhea may be underestimated by culture methods.",

Most notably, they are found later and have a lower proportion of bloody diarrhea than in patients infected with E. coli O157:H7.19 STEC are also responsible for an estimated 80% of HUS cases in about 4% of patients with enteric infection. Ground beef has been the major vehicle of transmission of O157 STEC, although other vehicles contaminated by bovine manure have been reported, including raw milk, sausage, apple cider, and raw vegetables and non-chlorinated water supply.

V. cholerae is primarily an aquatic inhabitant found in freshwater rivers and lakes as well as in estuarine and maritime environments. In these environments, V. cholerae is isolated from both the inanimate environment and from plankton and various bivalves, crabs, shrimp and prawns. A viable-but-not-cultivable state has been described in which regulation may be phage-dependent.31\nV. cholerae comprises three major subgroups, V. cholerae O1, V. cholerae O139 and V. cholerae non-O1, widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical areas, including the Gulf of Mexico for V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae O1 chromosomes contain virulence cassette and pathogenicity islands, encoding virulence factors such as the pilus responsible for the attachment of V. cholerae O1 organisms to the intestinal epithelium, and the cholera enterotoxin responsible for the substantial excretion of electrolytes and water in the intestinal lumen. Two biotypes, designated Classical and El Tor biotypes, can be differentiated on the basis of simple laboratory tests including the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, the Voges\u2013Proskauer test and resistance to polymyxin, which are all positive in the El Tor biotype. The first six historical pandemics are thought to be due to the Classical biotype whereas the on-going seventh pandemic since 1961 is due to the El Tor biotype.",

Based on group-specific antigens of the major viral structural protein VP6, rotaviruses can be classified in six groups A to G. Groups A to C infect humans, the other groups are found in animals. Human rotaviruses are responsible for severe acute diarrhea with dehydration associated with childhood death in low- and middle-income countries. In Europe, children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis were more likely to have lethargy, fever, vomiting and dehydration, and, therefore, more severe disease than were children with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis. Dehydration was up to 5.5 times more likely in children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis than in those with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis.49 Acquisition of rotaviruses is likely from subclinical infection in parents or siblings but rotavirus infection can be a zoonosis. Rotaviruses are resistant in the inanimate environment which may participate as a source of infection, including nosocomial outbreaks. Rotavirus infection is seasonal, with a peak of incidence in winter/spring in temperate countries. Clinical symptoms include acute diarrhea for 2\u20133 days, fever, vomiting and anorexia. Rapid diagnosis at the point-of-care can be achieved within 15 minutes by using a commercially available lateral-flow assay with parallel detection of adenovirus.",

Likewise, sapoviruses comprise five genogroups, the genotypes I, II, IV and V are responsible for human infections. These human viruses are highly contagious viruses which resist in the inanimate environment comprising contaminated surfaces, water and food. Outbreaks of norovirus infection are observed in daycare centers where child vomiting can readily contaminate floor and fomites.50 Accordingly, direct evidence for animals as reservoirs for human infection is still lacking. Noroviruses are the most prevalent cause of nonbacterial acute enteritis worldwide.51 These viruses cause large outbreaks and provoke incapacitation for a few days; they have therefore been included in the list B of potential bioterrorism agents by the NIAID. Outbreaks mainly occur in institutions including healthcare centers. Cruise ships appear to be an emerging setting for norovirus infection. Also, air flight has been shown to be a circumstance for norovirus diarrhea, for both cabin crew and passengers.52 The inanimate environment in healthcare centers is also a source for norovirus infection, and the viruses are resistant to routine cleansing and routine alcohol hand hygiene.53\n",

In contrast to the fortunate decrease of mortality, morbidity remains as high as during the previous century. However, simple, cheap measures could be undertaken to make the incidence fall. A prospective study in India demonstrated that the promotion of hand washing with plain soap reduced by 53% the incidence of acute diarrhea (and of pneumonia and impetigo).58 In industrialized countries, prevention relies on increased sanitary measures in sources of enteric pathogens such as recreational lakes for fishing and swimming, and swimming pools, as well as better control over fresh foods.

Sorbitol MacConkey agar should be used for the isolation of O157 STEC as these organisms do not ferment D-sorbitol, contrary to the vast majority of other E. coli strains. S. enterica serotypes are better isolated by using an enrichment broth before plating onto selective media. Biochemical identification of Salmonella spp. and O (somatic), H (flagellar) and Vi (capsular) antigen serotyping should be performed in order to identify Salmonella enteritis Typhi (the typhoid fever agent, being capsular antigen Vi positive) and the most prevalent non-Typhi serotypes. The Vi capsular antigen is occasionally detected in non-Typhi, Dublin and Paratyphi C serotypes. O serotype determination is done by agglutination using pooled antisera while further H serotype determination is done by tube agglutination tests using broth culture and testing the two phases of the flagellar antigens. Campylobacter spp. are recovered by using the filtration method in parallel to selective, blood-containing or non-blood containing media and a micro-aerophilic atmosphere. Some Campylobacter spp. require 6% hydrogen in atmosphere. A 42 \u00b0C incubation temperature allows the growth of C. jejuni and C. coli but not all Campylobacter and Aeromonas spp. are recovered using blood agar incorporating 20 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin and produce \u03b2-hemolytic colonies. Further identification should be done for oxidase-positive and indole-positive colonies. Modified cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin agar is also suitable for the isolation of Aeromonas species. The interpretation of recovery of Aeromonas in stools must be cautious since there is no strong evidence that all Aeromonas isolates from stools are responsible for diarrheal infection.72\n",

V. cholerae will be visible as very motile, gram-negative slightly curved bacilli cultivated using a TCBS agar after enrichment. Yellow colonies of oxidase-negative bacilli can be confirmed, by 16S rDNA sequencing. In parallel to the search for pathogenic bacteria, the search for viruses should be done using electron microscope observation after negative staining as well as detection of rotavirus. Identification of bacterial colonies is now routinely done by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.73\n",

            "text": "Management of acute diarrhea should include the clinical evaluation of the patient, including risk factors for specific etiology and dehydration; rapid diagnosis of viral diarrhea; and treatment, including rehydration, antibiotic treatment and symptomatic treatment. Rehydration is a major therapeutic measure. Oral rehydration has a higher risk of paralytic ileus, but intravenous rehydration exposes patients to risks of intravenous therapy. For every 25 children treated with oral rehydration one will fail and require intravenous rehydration.74 Rapid diagnosis of viral diarrhea is important in order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Because of the absence of any antiviral drug effective against the viruses responsible for acute diarrhea, the management of viral diarrhea comprises the relief of symptoms and rehydration. Most acute diarrhea episodes are self-limiting and do not require antibiotic treatment. Meta-analysis has confirmed that antibiotic treatment is useful to shorten the duration of signs and symptoms in travelers' acute diarrhea.75 When antibiotics should be prescribed, fluoroquinolones are the drugs of first choice, and one-day treatment is advocated except for Campylobacter and Shigella infections, which may be treated for three days.76 In the case of patients returned from countries where fluoroquinolone resistance is prevalent, such as Campylobacter spp. in Thailand, azithromycin (500 mg \u00d71/d) could be used for three days (see also Chapter 37 and Practice Point 11).77 Antimicrobial therapy for O157 E. coli enteritis remains a controversial issue because some studies reported a deleterious effect on the evolution of hemolytic uremic syndrome. The increasing resistance of S. enterica Typhi to antibiotics, notably to ciprofloxacin, makes the choice of first-line antibiotic treatment of typhoid fever more problematic (see Chapter 115). The majority of Y. enterocolitis gastroenteritis does not require antibiotic treatment, contrary to systemic infection which could be treated using trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (no resistant strain reported) or fluoroquinolones, despite the fact that a few resistant strains have been reported.78\n",
