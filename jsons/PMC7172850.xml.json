            "text": "Cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) and odontoglossum ringspot tobamovirus (ORSV) are the two most prevalent and economically important orchid viruses (Wong et al., 1994) that have attained a worldwide distribution, infecting numerous commercially important orchid genera (Zettler et al., 1990). As such, many diagnostic techniques have been developed over the years for the detection of these two plant viruses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used for the detection and identification of CymMV (Lim et al., 1993, Ryu et al., 1995) and ORSV (Ryu and Park, 1995). Detection by immunocapture-PCR of both viruses in orchids has also been reported (Barry et al., 1996). Some recent detection techniques developed at our laboratory include the use of digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled cRNA probes for the detection of both viruses (Hu and Wong, 1998), simultaneous detection of both viruses with RT-PCR using a single primer pair (Seoh et al., 1998), immuno-capillary zone electrophoresis (Eun and Wong, 1999), molecular beacons (Eun and Wong, 2000), and liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (Tan et al., 2000).",

It is based on the use of the 5\u2032 nuclease assay first described by Holland et al. (1991). This method exploits the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq polymerase to cleave a non-extendable, dual-labelled fluorogenic probe that is annealed to the target sequence during amplification (Lee et al., 1993, Bassler et al., 1995, Livak et al., 1995a, Livak et al., 1995b). The 5\u2032 end of the probe is labelled with a fluorescent reporter dye (e.g. FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)). Its emission spectrum is quenched by a second fluorescent dye (e.g. TAMRA (6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine)) at the 3\u2032 end, through F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) (F\u00f6rster, 1948).",

When the probe is cleaved by the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of the DNA polymerase, the reporter dye becomes physically separated from the quencher dye. This releases the quenching of FAM fluorescent emission and a signal is generated. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, resulting in an exponential increase in fluorescence intensity that is monitored in real-time.",

The cycle number in which amplification first enters a logarithm (log) phase, denoted by C\nT, provides a quantitative measurement of input target sequences. By performing the RT-PCR reaction with different known amounts of starting templates and determining the respective C\nT values from the amplification plots, a linear relationship (standard curve) can be established between C\nT values and the log of starting template amounts. The amount of starting template in any unknown sample can be determined by conducting one PCR reaction to ascertain the C\nT value (Heid et al., 1996). In this study, two orchid viruses, namely cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) and odontoglossum ringspot tobamovirus (ORSV) from infected orchid flower and leaf tissues were quantified simultaneously using the TaqMan\u00ae real-time RT-PCR.",

The release of a fluorogenic tag from the 5\u2032 end of the probe is proportional to the target sequence concentration or copy number. This increase in emission intensity is monitored at each cycle in real-time. To date, the TaqMan\u00ae fluorogenic system has been applied for the detection and quantitation of pathogens such as potato leaf roll virus (Schoen et al., 1996), feline coronaviruses (Gut et al., 1999), hepatitis C and B viruses (Mercier et al., 1999), varicella zoster virus (Hawrami and Breuer, 1999) and mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae (Bohm et al., 1999). This system is also applicable for the monitoring of gene expression.

With FRET, light energy absorbed by a high-energy chromophore is transferred to a nearby chromophore of lower energy subject to certain geometric and spectroscopic constraints, the most important of which is the distance between the two chromophores. In the fluorogenic 5\u2032 nuclease assay, the probes are labelled with two fluorescent dyes. One dye acts as a \u2018reporter\u2019 and the other acts as a \u2018quencher\u2019. The reporter transfers fluorescent energy to the quencher by FRET when they are in close proximity. Signal is generated when the hybridised oligo probe is cleaved by the DNA polymerase and the dyes are separated. This separation negates FRET effects and the fluorescent signal emitted by the reporter dye increases. The performance of the TaqMan\u00ae probes depends on the efficiency of reporter dye quenching, probe hybridisation; and probe cleavage by the Taq DNA polymerase (Livak et al., 1996). To facilitate efficient reporter dye quenching, the optimal probe length is between 20 and 30 nt. Probes longer than 30 nt risk forming inter- or intra-molecular structures that interfere with probe synthesis, flexibility, hybridisation, cleavage, as well as amplification process. Hence, the CymMV and ORSV probes selected for the fluorogenic assay are between 20 and 30 nt in length. For efficient hybridisation, the T\nm of a probe should be higher than that of the RT-PCR primers used. This is because primer-template hybrids are stabilised quickly as they are extended by the polymerase; whereas, the fluorogenic probe is not extended and therefore not stabilised. The higher T\nm compensates for their relative instability. The recommended T\nm of the probe is 70\u00b0C and the compatible RT-PCR primers should have a T\nm approximately 10\u00b0C lower. Thus, the T\nm of CymMV and ORSV probes were designed to be about 10\u00b0C higher than that of the primers. In addition, the 3\u2032 terminus of the probe is phosphorylated to prevent extension by the polymerase during the polymerization steps.",

In a RT-PCR reaction, the reverse transcriptase utilises only the reverse primer to synthesise the cDNA strand while the subsequent PCR amplification of the cDNA utilises equal amounts of forward and reverse primers. This results in a higher net loss of reverse primers and explains why the 300/900 nM F/R primer concentration exhibited higher repeatability and stability than that of the other two F/R primer concentrations. The unincorporated forward primers in the 900/900 and 900/300 nM F/R primer concentrations probably contributed to background fluorescence, widening the gap of the amplification plots.",

Data collected beyond the calculated C\nT is not considered for quantification purposes. Compared with quantification using endpoint measurements such as competitive RT-PCR, calculating C\nTs greatly expands the dynamic range of quantification. It was shown above that it is possible to attain a range of five orders of magnitude in starting copy number. As little as 104 copies or 5 fg each of CymMV and ORSV can be detected simultaneously with either the RdRp or CP gene as the target.
