Notably, the severity of coronavirus infection can vary widely; in humans, coronaviruses can cause a range of symptoms from a mild \"common cold\" to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In animals, for example, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) usually causes a mild or asymptomatic infection of cats, but can mutate leading to the development of a systemic and invariably fatal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Jaimes and Whittaker, 2018) .",

Two viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were subsequently isolated from patients with the common cold, and from the 1960s until 2002-2003, when SARS-CoV emerged from its animal reservoir, no link was made between CoV and more severe respiratory illness in humans. Subsequent to the SARS epidemic, increased surveillance led to the discovery of two additional human coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63, with HCoV-NL63 in particular linked to more severe disease, including croup (Perlman and McIntosh, 2019) .",

In contrast, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in late 2019 is transmitted rapidly from person to person, and over the course of three months has resulted in a pandemic. Human coronaviruses can therefore be described as either community-acquired respiratory (CAR) if they can sustain human-to-human transmission, or zoonotic if otherwise (Perlman and McIntosh, 2019) . Currently, only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as zoonotic whereas HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 are classified as CAR. SARS-CoV-2 has now emerged as a new CAR CoV. Overall, there is a wide range of coronavirus-induced disease, which has a major impact on public health, with no approved medical countermeasures, such as vaccines or antiviral drugs. ",

SARS-CoV was first reported in Southern China in the winter of 2002. Infected individuals usually exhibited mild respiratory symptoms that rapidly progressed into atypical pneumonia (Zhong et al., 2003) . SARS-CoV then rapidly spread internationally, causing more than 8000 confirmed infections across 29 countries, with almost 800 deaths (case fatality rate: 9.6%) by July 2003 (Lam et al., 2004; Skowronski et al., 2005 More recently, a new CoV, known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged in mainland China, causing a respiratory syndrome known as COVID-19 (Zhou et al., 2020) . At the time of writing (4/3/2020), there have been nearly one million confirmed cases around the world, with approximately 30,000 deaths. Now classified as a pandemic, COVID-19 has highlighted the devastating impact of CoVs on human health and the need to develop effective strategies to prevent future outbreaks.",

Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV then transitioned into an intermediate host: civet cats and raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV Li et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2009 ) and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV (Azhar et al., 2014; Mohd et al., 2016) , and subsequently crossed into the human population (Cui et al., 2019) . CoVs therefore possess immense zoonotic potential with devastating impacts on public health. This is especially important because novel SARS-CoV-like and MERS-CoV-like CoVs in bats have the capacity to infect human cells (Ge et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2018; Menachery et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the novel swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which recently devastated piglet populations in China, bears striking resemblance to the beginning of the SARS-CoV outbreak (Zhou et al., 2018) . Our phylogenetic analysis highlights similarities among various human CoVs as well as their analogous animal viruses (Figure 1) , emphasizing that there will likely be future CoV spillovers. ",

The S protein sequence of representative human coronaviruses and analogous animal coronaviruses were aligned using Geneious Tree Builder neighbor-joining method. The outer brackets refer to the genus (\u03b1or \u03b2-coronavirus), and the inner brackets to the lineage of \u03b2-coronavirus (A, B, C, or D).The boxed strains indicate the viruses that have caused severe outbreaks in the human population and are of focus in this review (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). * indicate CAR CoV, \u253c indicate zoonotic CoV. The tree was generated using HCoV-229E as the outgroup and Jukes-Cantor as the genetic distance model. Amino acid sequence of the spike proteins was obtained from NCBI Genbank based on the following: HCoV-229E (AAK32188.1), HCoV-NL63 (AGT51331), Bat-CoV HKU9-1 (NC_009021.1), Bat-CoV HKU4-1 (AY597011.2), MERS-CoV Camel (KJ650295.1), MERS-CoV EMC/2012 (JX869059.2), MERS-CoV Jordan-N3/2012 (KC776174.1), MERS-CoV England 1 (KC164505.2), Bat-CoV HKU5-1 (EF065509.1), HCoV-HKU1 (AY597011.2), HCoV-OC43 (KF963244.1), MHV-A59 (M18379.1), Bat-CoV WIVI (KC881007.1), SARS-CoV BJ01 (AY278488.2), SARS-CoV Tor2 (NC_004718.3), SARS-CoV GZ02 (AY390556.1), Bat-CoV RaTG13 (MN996532.1), SARS-CoV-2 01/human/2020/SWE (MT093571.1), SARS-CoV-2 USA-CruiseA-2/2020 (MT159718.1), and SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3).",
