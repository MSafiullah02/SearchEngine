In 1967, June Almeida and David Tyrrell performed electron microscopy on specimens from cultures of viruses known to cause colds in humans and identified particles that resembled avian infectious bronchitis virus. Almeida coined the term \u201ccoronavirus,\u201d from the Latin corona (\u201ccrown\u201d), because the glycoprotein spikes of these viruses created an image similar to a solar corona (Figure).",
