Herein we give a comprehensive review on the biological activity and synthesis of fl uorine containing, pyrimidine, pyrazine and pyridazine derivatives with relevance to medicinal and agrochemistry. Although being present in very small amounts, they are highly odiferous and can be detected at extremely low concentrations. Unlike other heterocycles found in many important natural products, pyridazines were discovered only after 1970, and relatively few pyridazines have thus far been isolated from natural sources.",

The fi rst representative of this class, Fluorouracil ( 1 ) was developed by Charles Heidelberger and co-workers in 1957 [ 4 ] . It was approved by U.S. FDA [ 5 ] in 1962 as antineoplastic agent in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil represents a class of rationally designed anticancer agents which act as antimetabolites. The observation that rat hepatomas utilized radiolabeled uracil more avidly than normal tissues [ 6 ] implied that the enzymatic pathways for utilization of uracil or its close analogs differed between malignant and normal cells -a feature which might provide a target for antimetabolite chemotherapy. A minimal modifi cation of uracil by introducing a single fl uorine atom allowed for implementation of cellular uptake and metabolic activation of 1 via the same transport processes and enzymes involved in the case of uracil. However, in the case of essential biological targets, remarkable differences are observed due to unique properties of the fl uorine atoms, which result in inhibition of the metabolic and signal pathways involved. Although all the details of the mechanism by which Fluorouracil gives its biological effect are not elucidated, a remarkable progress has been made over the past half a century in elucidating its cellular and clinical pharmacology [ 7 , 8 ] .",

            "text": "The key steps in Fluorouracil metabolism are shown in Scheme 1 . Up to 80 % of 1 administered as injection is transformed to dihydrofl uorouracil (DHFU, 13 ) by dihydropyrimidine dihydrogenase (mostly in liver tissues). However, this metabolite is not involved into antineoplastic activity; instead, 13 itself and its further metabolites are responsible for most of the toxic effects of 1 . The main mechanism of activation of Fluorouracil is conversion to fl uorouridine monophosphate (FUMP, 14 ), either directly by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, or via fl uorouridine (FUR, 15 ) through the sequential action of uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase. 14 is then phosphorylated to give fl uorouridine diphosphate (FUDP, 16 ), which can be either phosphorylated again to the active metabolite fl uorouridine triphosphate (FUTP, 19 ) , or reduced to fl uorodeoxyuridine diphosphate (FdUDP, 18 ) by ribonucleotide reductase. In turn, 18 can either be dephosphorylated or phosphorylated to generate An alternative activation pathway involves the thymidine phosphorylase catalysed conversion of 1 to Floxuridine (FUDR, 4 ), which is then phosphorylated by thymidine kinase to give 19 . The metabolite of 1 -Floxuridine -is itself used as an anti-cancer agent [ 9 ] . It was launched in 1970 by Hospira Inc [ 5 ] . Upon rapid injection, most of Floxuridine is catabolized to Fluorouracil; hence similar effects on the organism are obtained in this case. On the contrary, when 4 is slowly administered into the arterial blood, it is mostly transformed to 19 ; thus toxic effects are diminished comparing to 1 [ 10 ] .",

            "text": "It has long been recognized that one of the main mechanisms underlying Fluorouracil action is inhibition of thymidylate synthase by fl uorodeoxyuridine monophosphate ( 19 ) [ 11 ] . Thymidylate synthase belongs to a class of enzymes required for DNA replication, and its activity is higher in rapidly proliferating cells. In particular, thymidylate synthase is responsible for methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP, 21 ) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP, 22 ) with the use of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate ( 23 ) as a cofactor (Scheme 2 ) [ 12 ] . With fl uorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, a slowly-reversible ternary complex 24 is formed instead. Inhibition of thymidylate synthase leads to deoxyribonucleotide imbalance, and hence to interference with DNA synthesis and repair. Alternative mechanism of DNA-directed Fluorouracil effect is misincorporation of fl uorodeoxyuridine triphosphate ( 20 ) into DNA. Analogously, fl uorouridine triphosphate ( 17 ) is extensively incorporated into different RNA species, disrupting their normal processing and function [ 7 , 8 , 11 ] . Two principal approaches were used for the preparation of Fluorouracil (Scheme 3 ). One of the fi rst methods [ 13 , 14 ] commenced from ethyl fl uoroacetate which was subjected to Claisen condensation with ethyl formate to give 25 . The salt 25 was introduced into reaction with S -alkylisothiourea to give fl uoropyrimidines 26 , which were hydrolysed to give 1 . Several variations of this method were also described; their common drawback was the use of highly toxic fl uoroacetic acid derivatives. In an alternative approach, Fluorouracil was prepared by direct fl uorination of different pyrimidine derivatives, including uracil [ 15 ] , cytosine [ 16 ] , and orotic acid [ 17 ] . In the latter method, the initially obtained fl uoroorotic acid 27 was subjected to decarboxylation. The use of two-step reaction sequence was claimed to be advantageous due to simplifi ed product isolation and purifi cation.",

Apart from modulation of Fluorouracil biological action through combination therapies [ 7 , 24 ] , a number of drugs and clinical candidates acting as prodrugs of 1 and/or 4 were developed (Table 1 ) . The fi rst example of Fluorouracil prodrug is Tegafur ( 3 ) developed in 1960s in Latvia [ 25 , 26 ] . Tegafur is an oral slow-release prodrug formulation of Fluorouracil which is readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. The major pathway of metabolic activation of 3 includes hydroxylation by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, mostly CYP2A6 (Scheme 5 ) [ 27 ] . Apart from Fluorouracil, 4-hydrohybutyraldehyde and succinic dialdehyde are also formed, which are further transformed into \u03b3-butyrolactone and 4-hydrohybutyric acid [ 28 ] . Tegafur was shown to be 2-5 times more potent and less toxic than 1 ; hence lower doses of 3 can be utilized, resulting in decreased neurotoxicity without compromising the antitumor effects.",

The activation of 36 includes its fast non-enzymatic hydrolysis to 3o -toluyl-5-Fluorouracil ( 44 ) following oral administration; 44 is then slowly metabolized to 1 (Scheme 6 ) [ 40 ] . Since the acetyl group of Atofl uding is not stable and prone to decompose, impairing quality control for the preparation, a possibility of direct application of 44 was also considered [ 41 ] . An interesting idea was behind design of Emitefur ( 37 ), a prodrug of Fluorouracil which was developed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical and has reached Phase III clinical trials in Japan [ 3 , 42 , 43 ] . The structure of 37 contains the fragments of two biologically active components: Fluorouracil ( 1 ) and 3-cyano-2,6-dihydroxypyridine ( 45 ), which is a potent inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Therefore, 37 is a double prodrug which not only delivers Fluorouracil but also prevents its enzymatic biotransformation to the dihydropyrimidine derivative 12 . Metabolic activation of 37 occurs via rapid cleavage of the ester bonds by esterase to give 45 and 1-ethoxymethyl-5-fl uorouracil ( 46 ) (Scheme 7 ). The intermediate 46 is further metabolized to 1 by microsomal enzymes in the liver [ 44 ] . All the prodrugs of Fluorouracil discussed above contained the fragment of 1 in their structure; their transformation to 1 included hydrolysis reaction as the key step. On the contrary, 5-fl uoro-2-pyrimidinone (5-FP, 38 ) which has been studied in Phase I clinical trials [ 45 ] is activated through oxidative process. In particular, pyrimidine 38 is transformed to 1 by aldehyde oxidase, which is present in high concentrations in the human livers but not in the gastrointestinal tract [ 46 ] .",

Both the compounds were developed by Hoffman La Roche; whereas Capecitabine was launched in 1998, Galocitabine was terminated at Phase II clinical trials [ 47 ] . Both the compounds are close analogues as well as prodrugs of Doxifl uridine ( 5 ), which was used as the lead compound in their design. The main goals of such design were to minimize the mielotoxicity and to increase the tumor selectivity of 5 . In fact, Capecitabine ( 6 ) indeed demonstrated minimal mielotoxicity in clinical studies. Although the therapeutic indices of 39 were much higher in mice tumor models than in the case of 5 , it was not effi ciently metabolised to the active species in humans. The metabolic activation of 6 and 39 includes their hydrolysis by carboxylesterase or acylamidase in liver to give 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fl uorocytidine ( 47 ), which is then transformed to 5 by cytidine deaminase (Scheme 8 ) [ 48 ] . Syntheses of Fluorouracil prodrugs relied on either chemical modifi cation of 1 or direct fl uorination of the corresponding pyrimidine derivatives. In particular, Tegafur ( 3 ) was obtained from 1 by reaction with 2,3-dihydrofuran [ 49 -54 ] , 2-chloro- [ 55 , 56 ] , 2-alkoxy- [ 57 ] , 2-acetoxytetrahydrofuran [ 58 , 59 , 300 ] , and 4-trimethylsilyloxybutyraldehyde dimethyl acetal ( 48 ) (Scheme 9 ) [ 60 ] . Alternatively, 3 was prepared via fl uorination of compound 49 [ 61 ] or ester 50 [ 62 ] . One of the early syntheses of Doxifl uridine ( 5 ) [ 63 , 64 ] commenced from Floxuridine ( 4 ) which reacted with thionyl chloride to give cyclic sulphite 51 (Scheme 10 ). Methanolysis of 51 upon treatment with sodium methylate gave 52 , which was reduced with tributyltin to give 5 . In an analogous approach, the compound 5 was prepared via iodide 53 , in turn obtained from 4 in two steps (Scheme 11 ) [ 65 ] . It should be noted that direct transformation of 4 into the corresponding iodide was done with low yield of the product, hence the protection strategy was necessary to use. Bromide 54 was a key intermediate in one more analogous scheme [ 66 ] . Several syntheses of Doxifl uridine relied on glycosylation of Fluorouracil derivative 55 . In particular, 5\u2032-deoxyrybose derivatives 56 , 57 , and 58 were used for that purpose (Scheme 11 ) [ 67 , 68 ] . Finally, direct fl uorination of 5\u2032-deoxyuridine derivatives with F 2 /N 2 [ 69 ] or AcOF [ 70 ] was also described.",

With 60 as the glycosylating reagent, in situ generation of 55 from Fluorouracil was also described [ 74 ] . Synthesis of Carmofur ( 2 ) and Atofl uding ( 36 ) was performed in obvious and straightforward manner. Carmofur ( 2 ) was prepared by reaction of Fluorouracil ( 1 ) and n -hexylisocyanate (Scheme 15 ) [ 77 , 78 ] . Alternative approach included reaction of 1 with phosgene and then -with n -hexylamine. Early syntheses of 5-fl uoro-2-pyrimidinone ( 38 ) relied on desulfurization of Fluorouracil thio-derivatives. In particular, reaction of pyrimidine derivatives 68 with P 2 S 5 followed by treatment with Raney nickel and gave alkoxy derivative 69 , which was transformed to 38 upon acidic hydrolysis (Scheme 18 ) [ 83 ] . A more straightforward transformation sequence was also described; including reaction of Fluorouracil ( 1 ) with P 2 S 5 and reduction of thione 70 with Raney nickel [ 84 , 85 ] . Alternatively, the thione 70 was alkylated to give derivative 71 , which was either oxidated and then hydrolyzed [ 86 ] or subjected to reaction with hydrazine and then -silver oxide [ 301 ] ; in both cases, 38 was obtained. A completely different synthetic scheme commenced from fl uoroacetic acid which was subjected to Vilsmeiertype formylation to give 2-fl uoro-3-dimethylamino-acrolein ( 72 ) [ 87 ] . Reaction of 72 with triethyloxonium tetrafl uoroborate and dimethylamine gave the salt 73 , which led to 38 upon reaction with urea. Finally, 38 was also obtained by direct fl uorination of 2-pyrimidinone [ 88 , 89 ] .",

As in the case of Fluorouracil, one of the mechanisms by which compound 7 exhibits its antitumor activity is inhibition of thymidylate synthase [ 100 ] . More precisely, Trifl uridine is transformed into \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-trifl uorothymidine monophosphate ( 76 ) by thymidine kinase (Scheme 21 ); similarly to the Fluorouracil derivatives discussed in the previous sections, compound 76 is true inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. However, compound 7 exhibits an anticancer effect on colorectal cancer cells that have acquired Fluorouracil resistance as a result of the overexpression of thymidylate synthase. Therefore, an alternative mechanism of action is also in operation, namely, incorporation of \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-trifl uorothymidine triphosphate ( 77 ) into DNA, which results in single-strand breaks, followed by double-strand breaks when the cells progress to a subsequent DNA replication phase [ 101 ] The major drawback of Trifl uridine ( 7 ) is its high susceptibility to biodegradation, which is catalysed by thymidine phosphorylase and gives \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-trifl uorothymine ( 78 ) and 2-deoxy-\u03b1-Dribose 1-phosphate ( 79 ) [ 102 ] . In the case of TAS-102, this issue is overcome by co-administration of thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor Tipiracil ( 75 ) [ 103 ] , whereas improved biological effect of FTC-092 upon oral administration is achieved by its gradual biotransformation, mainly through the action of liver microsomes, releasing 7 over a long period [ 104 ] .",

Compound 78 was transformed to 7 in low yield (8 %) by enzymatic glycosylation [ 105 ] . The yield of the last step in this sequence was signifi cantly improved when 78 was preliminarily transformed to bis-silyl derivative 83 , and chloride 84 was used for glycosylation [ 106 , 107 ] An alternative approach to 7 was based on direct trifl uoromethylation of the corresponding deoxyuridine derivatives 32 or 84 , using CF 3 COOH-XeF 2 [ 108 ] and CF 3 I-Cu-HMPA [ 109 ] as the reagents, respectively (Scheme 23 ).

Apart from that, compound 88 is also investigated as agent for treatment of autoimmune thrombocytopenia and rheumatoid arthritis. Because of its poor pharmaceutical properties, Tamatinib ( 92 ) is orally administered as the methylene phosphate ( 88 ) is quickly cleaved to 92 by alkaline phosphatases that are present on the apical brush-border membranes of the intestinal enterocytes, after which the more hydrophobic 92 can be readily absorbed [ 116 ] .

It is shown that BCR-mediated signaling through Syk occurs to a greater degree and for a longer duration in neoplastic cells than in nonmalignant B-cells.

First, boronic ester 94 was prepared from aniline 95 in three steps, including benzimidazole ring construction and palladiumcatalyzed coupling with pinacol diborane. Suzuki-type reaction of 93 and 94 resulted in selective functionalization at C-4 of the pyrimidine ring and gave chloride 96 . Buchwald-Hartwig coupling of 96 with amine 97 (prepared in two steps from 1-ethylpiperazine ( 98 ) and ( 99 )) gave the fi nal product 87 . Analogously, selective functionalization of 93 was used for the preparation of Fostamatinib disodium ( 88 ) (Scheme 29 ). In particular, reaction of 93 with equimolar amount of amine 100 and then -with 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline ( 101 ) gave Tamatinib ( 92 ) [ 124 ] . It should be noted that no detailed procedures of performing these transformations were given in the initial patent; moreover, synthesis of the starting compound (amine 100 ) is not documented to date.

Analogously to 137 , the biologically active form of 8 is triphosphate 139 , which is formed by a stepwise phosphorylation of 8 (Scheme 33 ). Compound 139 can be considered as 2,3-dideoxycytidine trifosphate analogue and acts as a competitive inhibitor and alternate substrate of the normal deoxycytidine triphosphate ( 140 ). As a competitive inhibitor of the normal substrate, 139 inhibits incorporation of 140 into the growing DNA chain by viral reverse transcriptase; as an alternate substrate, it is incorporated into this chain (as 141 ) and acts as a chain terminator (since 141 is missing the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group required for further chain elongation) [ 128 , 129 ] . Although Emtricitabine might have the potential for toxicity caused by interaction with human mitochondrial DNA enzymes, both in vitro and in vivo testing results show that this is not a serious issue. Low toxicity of 8 as compared to other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is a remarkable advantage of this drug. As with all representatives of this class, the major drawback of 8 is rapid development of drug resistance by a single point mutation of viral reverse transcriptase [ 129 ] . The main route of elimination of 8 is renal excretion, mostly unchanged (86 % of the dose). The metabolic transformations of Emtricitabine include oxidation of the sulphur atom to form the 3\u2032-sulfoxide diastereomers (9 %) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to give 2\u2032-O -glucuronide (4 %) [ 130 ] .",

It is effective against herpetic keratitis, and seems to be especially useful in 'diffi cult' cases [ 160 ] . High susceptibility to biodegradation of Trifl uridine is advantageous for its use as ophthalmic drug, as its action in other tissues is thus prevented. As in the case of anti-tumor activity, the mechanism of antiviral action of 7 involves the inhibition of viral replication. Trifl uridine does this by incorporating into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate [ 161 ] .

Compound 210 acts as an inhibitor of peptide deformylase -an enzyme that removes the formyl group during eubacterial peptide elongation. Bacterial protein synthesis initiates with formyl-methionyl-tRNA and, consequently, all polypeptides newly synthesized in bacteria contain an N -formylmethionine terminus. This residue is further removed in two steps catalyzed by peptide deformylase and methionine aminopeptidase, respectively. Inhibition of peptide deformylase increase production of bacterial N -formylated polypeptide, which prevents bacteria growth and possibly triggers an enhanced immune response [ 170 ] .

Flucytosine itself has no antifungal activity; its activity results from the rapid conversion into Fluorouracil ( 1 ) within susceptible fungal cells [ 173 ] . The mechanism of cytotoxic effect of Fluorouracil has been discussed in the previous sections. Flucytosine is taken up by fungal cells by cytosine permease, which is the transport system for cytosine and adenine. Inside the fungal cells, 9 is deaminated to 1 by cytosine deaminase. The specifi city of this step is crucial for the narrow antifungal spectrum of 9 : mammalian cells as well as fungi lacking cytosine deaminase are not sensitive to 9 . On the other hand, Fluorouracil itself cannot be used as an antifungal drug, since it is only poorly taken up by fungal cells and is too toxic to human cells. The major drawback of Flucytosine is rapid development of resistance in fungi, either by mutations or by increased synthesis of pyrimidines; this limits the use of 9 as a single antifungal agent. Monotherapy with Flucytosine is currently only used in some cases of chromoblastomycosis and in uncomplicated candidosis; in all other cases, 9 is used together with other agents, usually Amphotericin B [ 173 ] .",

Voriconazole is active against many fungal infections, including invasive aspergillosis, Pseudallescheria , Scedosporium , Fusarium infections [ 175 ] . It is also proposed for empirical antifungal therapy [ 176 ] . An important advantage of Voriconazole is high oral bioavailability (96 %). The most common side effect, which is unique for Voriconazole among other azole antifungals, is a reversible disturbance of vision (photopsia): it occurs in nearly a third of patients but rarely leads to discontinuation of the drug [ 174 ] . Resistance to Voriconazole still remains uncommon, although an increase of resistance and continued surveillance with greater use of the drug has been reported [ 177 ] .",

The synthetic scheme is quite similar to that for Fluorouracil ( 1 ); in the case of 9 , compound 27 was subjected to reaction with PCl 5 and then -liquid ammonia to give 219 , which was transformed to 9 upon hydrolysis (Scheme 52 ). In an alternative method, compound 70 (prepared from Fluorouracil) reacted with SOCl 2 to give 220 , which was transformed to 9 upon reaction with ammonia in methanol [ 84 ] . Another synthesis commenced from 2,5-difl uoro-4-chloropyrimidine, which, however, is not readily accessible [ 178 ] . Flucytosine was also obtained by direct fl uorination of cytosine using CF 3 OF (85 % yield) [ 179 , 180 ] , fl uorine [ 181 , 182 ] , and AcOF [ 20 ] . Despite numerous syntheses of Voriconazole ( 10 ) were documented, they all followed the same synthetic strategy, namely, addition of anion 221 to ketone 222 , followed by isolation of necessary diastereomeric pair and its resolution with 10-camphorsulphonic acid (Scheme 53 ). Three different approaches were used for the generation of anion 221 or the corresponding organometallic species. First of them relied on deprotonation of the pyrimidine derivative 222 (prepared from the fl uorinated keto ester 223 or dichloro derivative 93 ) by strong bases such as LDA (Scheme 54 ) [ 183 -189 ] .",

BW-4030W92 ( 232 ) was developed as a CNS-acting antihyperalgesic agent ( i.e. for treatment of increased sensitivity to pain). It is an analogue of anticonvulsant drug Lamotrigine ( 260 ) (Fig. 9 ) , used n the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder [ 233 ] . Like Lamotrigine, BW-4030W92 binds to the transmembrane segment S6 in domain IV of \u03b1 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels (Na v ), thus acting as a pore blocker [ 234 ] . It is assumed that neuropathic pain is partially mediated by an increase in the density of Na V channels in injured axons and their dorsal root ganglions. Clinical studies in patients with chronic neuropathic pain showed that although BW-4030W92 signifi cantly lowered allodynia severity at the fi rst day, the effect did not maintain in further treatment [ 235 ] .

In the latter study, single doses of GW842166 failed to demonstrate clinically meaningful analgesia in the setting of acute dental pain [ 237 ] .

As in the case of lymphoma, the effect of 88 in autoimmune diseases is related to inhibition of Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) by 92 [ 241 , 242 ] . As Syk has the central role in transmission of activating signals within B cells, inhibition of this enzyme lowers expression of a number of proinfl ammatory cytokines and hence leads to immunosuppression [ 243 ] . Fostamatinib has shown signifi cant effi cacy in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis not responding to Methotrexate ( 272 ) (a drug which is used conventionally in therapy), although a number of adverse events were observed [ 244 ] . If these results are confi rmed once Phase III studies are completed, it may fi nd a place in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with poor response to conventional therapy (Fig. 11 ) . Gemigliptin ( 12 ) was developed by LG Life Sciences as an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) -a target of oral drugs used to treat used to treat type 2 diabetes (characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin defi ciency) [ 245 ] . The fi rst representative of this class, Sitagliptin ( 273 ) was launched in 2006. In human body, Gemigliptin is metabolized to LC15-0636, which is a major active metabolite, by cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme [ 246 ] . Inhibition of DPP-4 results in increase of incretin levels (which is normally inactivated by DPP-4), in particular glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) [ 247 ] . Incretins inhibit glucagons release and stimulate insulin secretion, which leads to decrease in glucose blood levels. Clinical trials showed effi cacy and safety of Gemigliptin administered once daily as a monotherapy, [ 248 ] as well as in addition to Metformin ( 274 ) [ 249 ] for type 2 diabetes patients.",

Butafenacil (developed by Syngenta AG) is used for weed control in grapes, nut crops, pome and stone fruits and also as a cotton defoliant [ 259 ] . It was registered in Australia and approved by U. S. environmental protection agency. Benzfendizone (developed by FMC Corporation) is a post-emergence herbicide that provides good control of grass and broadleaf weeds in tree fruits and vines, as a cotton defoliant, and in total vegetation control [ 256 ] . Flufenpyr-ethyl (developed by Sumitomo Chemical Company) was registered in USA for use on corn, soybeans and sugarcane [ 259 ] . The most recent example is Safl ufenacil ( 294 , Kixor\u00ae), introduced by BASF in 2009 for preplant burndown and selective PRE dicot weed control in multiple crops, including corn. [ 260 ] . Compounds 292 -295 act as inhibitors of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Protox) -an enzyme in the chloroplasts of the plant cells that oxidizes protoporphyrinogen IX ( 303 ) to produce protoporphyrin IX ( 304 ) (Scheme 66 ) [ 261 ] . In turn, 304 is a precursor molecule for both chlorophyll and heme. When protoporphyrinogen oxidase is inhibited, protoporphyrinogen IX is accumulated and transferred from chloroplasts into the cytoplasm, where non-enzymatic conversion of 303 to 304 occurs. When present in cytoplasm, 304 is cytotoxic due to interaction with oxygen upon action of light, which results in formation of singlet O 2 molecules. 1 O 2 causes lipid peroxidation, membrane disruption and plant cell death. Butafenacil is known to be eye, skin and respiratory tract irritant in humans [ 262 ] . It also demonstrated very high toxic effect to algae, and moderate toxicity to fi sh, aquatic invertebrates and honeybees. For Benzfendizone and Flufenpyr-ethyl, no reports on toxic effects are available. Acute mammalian toxicology studies of Safl ufenacil indicate that herbicide has low toxicity for mammals after ingestion, dermal exposure or inhalation. It is not an irritant for eyes and skin and does not act as a sensitizer.",

The predominance of one pathway is very crop specifi c. In cotton, 296 and 297 are metabolized by the displacement of the 7-fl ouro substituent on the triazolopyrimidine ring by a hydroxy group, forming 332 .

This enzyme, also referred to as ubiquinol: ferricytochrome c reductase, or complex III, is the third complex in the electron transport chain -a cascade of enzymes which couples electron transfer between NADH and O 2 with the transfer of H + ions across a membrane to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [ 287 ] . The overall result of the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome bc 1 complex is reduction of ferricytochrome c by oxidation of ubiquinol ( 355 ) and the concomitant pumping of 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. The mechanism of this process is too sophisticated to be discussed herein. It is important that the enzyme has two binding sites for the substrate 355 or its oxidized form 356 (Fig. 14 ) , i.e. outer (Q 0 ) and inner (Q 1 ), and the quinone outside inhibitors bind to the outer site. This leads to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration -a process which is essential to all living organisms. The selective biological effect of quinone outside inhibitors on certain organisms ( i.e. fungi or mites) is achieved by differential penetration and degradation between various species, leading to a combination of high fungicidal (or acaricidal, in the case of 301 ) potency and good crop safety [ 288 ] . Unfortunately, resistance has already evolved to this class of pesticides in some plant pathogens in certain geographical areas [ 289 ] . Although the in vitro fungicidal activity of the natural strobilurin A was discovered soon, its agrobiological testing in vivo was diffi cult because of its volatility and the inherent lability of the ( E,Z,E )-triene system, which resulted in rapid photolytic or metabolic degradation.

Undoubtedly the success was achieved due to joint progress of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry as well as synthetic methods of heterocyclic and fl uoroorganic chemistry. The continued progresses in these fi elds of science allow us to predict that the number of fl uorine containing diazines as drugs or agrochemicals on the market will be increased. Recent trends in using of perfl uorinated diazines as core scaffold for the synthesis of a diverse array of polysubstituted fl uorinated diazines for HTS increases probability of these compounds as potential hits and leads. Also the new methodologies of direct introduction of fl uorinated substituent, like Baran approach, continue to appear facilitating further investigation. Moreover in the chemical space covered by fl uorinated diazines remains \"white spots\". Thus diazine scaffold decorated by important in med and agrochem fl uorinated fragments such as -CHF 2 , -CH 2 CF 3 , -OCF 3 , -SCF 3 , -SF 5 not investigated because the synthetic chemistry of these compounds on development phase or not developed at all. Therefore the comprehensive investigations in the fi eld of fl uorinated diazines still are interesting both for academic and industrial scientists. ",

Selective tosylation of 145 followed by acetylation gave 146 . Treatment of 146 with HBr in AcOH yielded the bromo derivative 147 , which was refl uxed with O -ethylxanthate and then deacetylated using NH 4 OH in MeOH to obtain the 1,6-thioanhydro-L-gulopyranose ( 148 ).
