Accumulating evidences propose that the mutant of the virus, as well as the age, immune status and genetic profiles of the host may be involved in the clinical phenotypes exhibited by EV71-infected individuals [3], nevertheless, what determines the clinical outcome of EV71-induced HFMD is poorly understood.",

In 2009, the potential function of lncRNAs in innate immunity were identified for the fist time [5]. Since then, increasing number of lncRNAs have been identified to participated in innate immune system and the related immune and inflammatory responses, such as lincRNA-COX2 [5], Lethe [6], PACER [7] and lnc-DC [8]. The innate immune system is the first defense line of the host to recognize and clear the invasion pathogens. The tightly regulation of innate immune system is closely associated with the elimination efficiency of pathogen infection. Although, many lncRNAs have been uncovered exhibiting flexible manners in regulation of innate immunity, the function of most of lncRNAs are still unknown and need to be discovery.",

Moreover, the lncRNAs have distinctive kinetic expression profiles in type I interferon receptor and STAT1 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV, including unique signatures of lncRNAs expression associated with lethal infection [11]. The expression of lncRNA Tmevpg1 (also known as NeST) was increased and essential for the host persistence of Theiler's virus [12]. In EV71-infected Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, more than 4800 lncRNAs differentially expressed [13], however, whether lncRNAs play essential roles in host-EV71 interaction is still lack in vivo and clinical evidences, which is needed further exploration.",

The Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated general variations in lncRNAs and mRNAs expression in the PBMCs of EV71-infected HFMD patients (Fig. 1\nA and B).

The underlying mechanism about the abnormal regulation of EV71-induced immune and inflammatory state attract increasing concerns, and most of the researches are focus on the coding genes. Actually, non-coding RNAs such as microRNA and lncRNA have been revealed having variety of function in physiological and pathological processes. Although lncRNAs have been clarified functioning after many virus infection, while little was known in EV71-infected HFMD. In EV71-infected RD cells, 4800 lncRNAs were differentially expressed, 160 of the lncRNAs regulated enhancer-like lncRNA and mRNA pairs nearby the lncRNAs [13]. The study pointed out the potential roles of lncRNAs in the host response to EV71 infection, however, still need the clinical proof to confirm the putative function of EV71 infection-related lncRNAs.

In our research, we isolated and sequenced the EV71 RNA, and found the EV71-isolated from either mild or severe patients were all assigned to subgenotype C4a and with no sequence difference after sequence alignment (data not shown). These data indicated that the mild or severe clinical complications of the EV71-infected patients might not due to the virus mutant. The genes which dynamic change in response to the stimulations or accompany with the progression of diseases, may have crucial biological functions. Through STC analysis, the lncRNAs dynamic expression profiles were obtained at various time points after 2/3 partial hepatectomy, moreover, lncRNA-LALR1 was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner and was essential for the hepatocyte proliferation [26]. In the lung tissue of H1N1-infected mice, a total of 82 miRNA expression were significantly different from the control mice, and the dynamically expressed 17 miRNAs were confirmed more significant and related to the influenza A pathway through STC and further investigation [27]. We focused on the dynamic genetic profile after EV71 infection and screened the 8 significant dynamic expression profiles of lncRNAs using STC analysis. The first 4 significant profiles were Profile9, profile11, Profile15 and Profile14 each contained thousands of lncRNAs which constantly up or down regulated in healthy control, mild and severe HFMD patients. In the most significant Profile9, 10 lncRNAs were identified associated with the inflammation and innate immune response upon EV71 infection. The lncRNAs with dynamic expression change may be more correlated with the severity of the HFMD clinical symptoms, and could play crucial roles in the regulation of EV71-induced immune and inflammatory responses.",

In lung tissue of SARS-CoV-infected mouse, the expression of lncRNAs widespread changed when compared with the control, and the similar changes were also proved during influenza virus infection, revealing that a common lncRNAs-based characterize of host response to respiratory viral infection [11]. After influenza virus or herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, lncRNA NEAT1 (nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1) expression was increased [28]. Then NEAT1 interacted with SFPQ (Splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich) and mediated SFPQ leaving from the promoter of IL-8, leading to activation of IL-8 in TLR3-p38 signaling pathway [28]. Moreover, upon HIV-1 infection, NEAT1 expression was up-regulated to inhibit HIV-1 replication [29]. On the other hand, viruses also can hijack lncRNAs for virus replication and viral protein synthesis benefiting for their own life process and suppressing the antiviral immune responses [30]. In response to the influenza A virus (IAV), virus inducible lincRNA (VIN) were up-regulated, which was also investigated in after H1N1, H3N2, H7N7 as well as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [31]. The further function abolition of VIN leaded to the restriction of IAV replication and viral protein synthesis, highlighting the relevance of VIN in IAV virulence and virus pathogenesis [31]. We identified and confirmed 10 lncRNAs which were differentially expressed in EV71-infected mild patients, severe patients and healthy control. Among the 10 lncRNAs, the expression of n409323 was positive correlation with CARD8 expression level, and CARD8 may be involved in the negative regulation of I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB cascade upon EV71 infection, indicating that n409323 may play some roles in I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway regulation. Notably, the I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB cascade is one of most critical pathways for the production of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the anti-viral innate immune responses [32]. The other screened lncRNAs were associated with innate immune and inflammatory responses according to the GO and pathway analysis, however, the function and the regulation mechanism of these lncRNAs still need further exploration.",

Moreover, we analyzed the lncRNAs dynamic differentially expressed profile revealing the potential crucial roles of lncRNAs in determinant of EV71-induced HFMD clinical manifestation progress. The screened 10 lncRNAs, that were correlated with the innate immune and inflammatory responses, suggested the pathogenesis of imbalanced inflammation during EV71 infection, and may severe as the candidate direction for intervention of severe EV71-infected cases.",
