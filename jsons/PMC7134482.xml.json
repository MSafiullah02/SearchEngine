            "text": "All data relating to exhaled air dispersion during such procedures come from scientific studies conducted in a negative pressure room, on a high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS) that represents a 70 kg adult male sitting on a 45\u00b0 inclined hospital bed. Exhaled air dispersion distance from the HPS has been evaluated using a laser smoke visualisation method and calculated on the median sagittal plane. Table 1 shows the maximum dispersion distances, the medium values are as follows.\nOxygen therapy via nasal cannula: exhaled air spreads from the HPS's nostrils towards the end of the bed almost horizontally to 66 cm when the oxygen flow setting is 1 L\u00b7min\u22121, to 70 cm when it is increased to 3 L\u00b7min\u22121 and 1 m when it is 3\u20135 L\u00b7min\u22121 [8].Oxygen therapy via oronasal masks: the exhaled air jet reaches 40 cm with an oxygen flow of 4 L\u00b7min\u22121 [9].Oxygen therapy via Venturi mask: exhaled air dispersion distance reduces with increasing lung injury. Delivering 24% oxygen with a flow rate at 4 L\u00b7min\u22121 in a normal lung and severe lung injury setting produces an air dispersion of 40 cm and 32 cm, respectively. When 40% oxygen is delivered at an 8 L\u00b7min\u22121 flow rate the exhaled air dispersion distance is, in the same two lung settings, 33 cm and 29 cm, respectively [10]. These distances were studied in a general ward without negative pressure, but with double exhaust fans for room ventilation. When they were off, the air ventilation rates on the ward dropped significantly and the exhaled smoke filled the ward within 5 min.Oxygen therapy via non-rebreathing mask: exhaled air dispersion distance is <10 cm irrespective of oxygen flow rate (6\u20138\u201310\u201312 L\u00b7min\u22121) in either normal lung or severe lung injury [6].CPAP via oronasal mask: (CPAP 5, 10, 15 or 20 cmH2O) exhaled air disperses evenly in all directions through the mask's vent holes at a very low normalised smoke concentration irrespective of the severity of lung injury [11] and, therefore, it was not feasible to measure distinct exhaled air dispersion.CPAP via nasal cannula (nasal pillows): there is an increase of air dispersion with increasing CPAP and a reduction of air dispersion with worsening lung injury. Using two types of nasal pillows, at a maximum CPAP of 20 cmH2O and with a normal lung, maximum air dispersion distances are 26.4 cm (Nuance Pro Gel) and 33.2 cm (Swift FX) [11].HFNC: in a normal lung, there is an increase of air dispersion distance with increasing flow to a maximum of 17.2 cm at 60 L\u00b7min\u22121. With this flow rate, when nasal cannula is tightly connected lateral air dispersion is negligible, otherwise it can reach 62 cm. Worsening lung injury causes a reduction in air dispersion distance from HPS [11].NIV via full-face mask: in the Bilevel setting (inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) 10 cmH2O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) 5 cmH2O) with a single limb circuit connected to HPS, the exhaled air jet spreads through the mask's holes up to 69.3 cm, 61.8 cm and 58 cm in the normal lung, mild lung injury and severe lung injury setting, respectively. Increasing IPAP leads to increasing exhaled air dispersion distance, e.g. with IPAP 18 cmH2O exhaled air jet reaches 91.6 cm [12].NIV via helmets: with IPAP 12 cmH2O and EPAP 10 cmH2O, the exhaled air dispersion distance is 17 cm in normal lung and 15 cm in mild or severe lung injury. With IPAP 20 cmH2O the air dispersion distances in three different settings (normal lung, mild lung injury and severe lung injury) are 27, 23 and 18 cm, respectively (e.g. Oxygen Head Tent; Sea-Long, Waxahachie, TX, USA). Helmets with a tight air cushion around the neck\u2013helmet interface, in a double limb circuit, have negligible air dispersion during NIV application (e.g. CaStar R; StarMed, Wokingham, UK) [12].",

However, we can argue that pressures set during NIV via helmet ventilation are relatively low. Moreover, all examined studies used smoke as the air exhaled marker, while viral transmission seems to happen through droplets; droplets are, indeed, heavier thus they should follow a briefer trajectory than the smoke. All results shown should, therefore, represent the upper limit of exhaled air dispersion and thus overestimate it. It's interesting to note, however, that all studies (except the one that used a Venturi mask) were conducted in a negative pressure room with at least six air changes per hour (minimum air changes recommended by WHO is 12 per hour) [4, 14]. In medical wards not equipped with negative pressure rooms, like those which admit most COVID-19 patients because of reduced bed availability, it is reasonable to imagine a higher exhaled air dispersion and contamination.",

Canadian anaesthesiologists' advice to consider the use of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) for high-risk procedures (figure 1). PAPRs use a battery-powered fan to conduct air through a filter allowing the wearer to breathe through a mask or a helmet. PAPRs may offer greater protection than FFP2, even if there is no evidence about comparison of these PPEs in terms of viral transmission. However, the use of PAPRs is burdened by the high costs and communication limits determined by the noise of the fan. Another risk that must be considered is the high probability of contamination during the undressing procedures, which makes it necessary to support healthcare workers with expert staff.",

Oxygen therapy, HFNC, CPAP and NIV are noninvasive support methods with a high risk of aerosol dispersion, especially in unprotected environments. Being aware of the exhalation distance of the various methods allows us to favour those with the lowest risk (e.g. helmet with an inflatable neck cushion) and to take the necessary precautions (e.g. correct placing of the HFNC). Despite the high risk of contagion during these procedures, evidence suggests that the observance of the indications for the use of PPE are effective in preventing infections among healthcare workers. In a case\u2013control study conducted during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong [21] which investigated the effective adhesion of personnel to PPE (gloves, disposable shirts, goggles and masks) none of the staff reporting use of all measures contracted the virus, while all the infected staff had omitted at least one measure.
