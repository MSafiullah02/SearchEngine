It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, with sporadic cases reported globally, becoming a global health emergency.1 COVID-19 pneumonia has had a significant impact on people's health and social activity behavior and on economic development. The Chinese government reported that 78,195 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed, 2,491 cases were suspected, and 2,718 patients had died as of February 26, 2020.2 The outbreak of COVID-19 led to the closure of Wuhan, workers were delayed to work, and schools were closed across China. Although the majority of cases are mild, a certain proportion of patients develop critical illness, with a documented case-fatality rate of 2.3% in China.1 Reports to date indicate that although patients of all ages are susceptible to the disease, individuals developing critical illness were older and had a greater number of comorbid conditions,3 suggesting that patients with comorbid conditions have high mortality rates and poor outcomes.",

Procalcitonin has similar limitations, with levels chronically elevated in hemodialysis patients even in the absence of severe acute illness.11 Given these limitations and the high prevalence of comorbid conditions, COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis in hemodialysis patients is dependent on clinical epidemiology, radiographic findings, and viral nucleic acid testing.",

Our results suggest that lopinavir/ritonavir may improve the course of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients receiving hemodialysis, although the lack of a control patient makes this conclusion somewhat subjective.

This begins with strengthening prescreening triage of hemodialysis patients.5 Persons without face masks are not allowed to enter the hemodialysis ward. We also implemented a policy whereby it was mandated that the \u201cCOVID-19 Pneumonia Screening Registration Form\u201d be completed (Box 1\n). All patients had their temperature checked at the entrance to the hemodialysis unit and were surveyed regarding any recent fever, cough, or exposure to epidemic areas or to individuals who have visited epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks. If available, particularly within epidemic areas, we suggest promptly assessing for SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid with swabs, especially in those with respiratory symptoms. For nonsuspected patients with potential COVID-19 exposure or from epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks, we performed hemodialysis in an isolation area within the hemodialysis facility.Box 1COVID-19 Pneumonia Screening Registration Form\n\nAbbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; N, no; Tel, telephone; Y, yes.",
