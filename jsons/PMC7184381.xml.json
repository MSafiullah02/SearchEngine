We have halted all elective cases, but will continue to schedule urgent and emergent cases. Emergent cases such as head and spine trauma, cauda equina syndrome, embolic stroke, ruptured aneurysms, and acute hydrocephalus are relatively noncontroversial; however, urgent cases such as malignant brain tumors and progressive cervical spondylotic myelopathy may require a more nuanced discussion. Therefore, we have empowered a small neurosurgery COVID team consisting of senior neurosurgeons with multidisciplinary backgrounds who review a brief history and select imaging studies and make decisions for urgent surgical cases. The presence of an independent adjudicating body will improve surgical decision-making consistency and decrease suboptimal use of hospital resources and unnecessary exposure of staff to disease. Additionally, screening all surgical cases preoperatively for COVID-19 is critical. We impose a 14-d delay for cases with this concern. Finally, to minimize the need to physically return to clinic, we use dissolvable sutures.3,4 This step allows postoperative patients to be seen via our telemedicine protocols noted below.",
