Multiple factors influence an individual\u2019s susceptibility to a pathogen, including variation in pathogen dose or virulence as well as host age, prior immune experience, microbiome/coinfection, and genetics. A role for host genetics in pathogen susceptibility is supported both by twin studies (Kallmann and Reisner, 1943) and by evidence of pathogen-driven selective pressure on the evolution of the human immune system (Cagliani and Sironi, 2013). Human genetic studies have demonstrated a role for host genetics in pathogen susceptibility and identified polymorphic genetic loci and genes associated with variation in susceptibility to specific pathogens (e.g., HIV) (McLaren et al., 2015), classes of pathogens (e.g., mycobacteria) (Bustamante et al., 2014), and more generalized primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) that result in severe immune defects (Chapman and Hill, 2012). This information has enhanced our understanding of how host genetic variation affects pathogen susceptibility and how specific genes regulate human immunity and host-pathogen interactions.",

            "text": "While advances in human genetic analysis have led to the identification of several host genes that regulate pathogen susceptibility in humans (Newport and Finan, 2011), much of our understanding of how specific genes affect infectious disease pathogenesis in mammals has come from studies using mouse models (Masopust et al., 2017). This is in large part due to the existence of inbred mouse strains as well as the vast amount of immunological and molecular genetic tools available for the mouse, including the early generation of the mouse reference genome. Inbred strains, in which each mouse is essentially genetically identical, allow control of host genetics as well as other factors that can confound human studies, such as pathogen dose, nutrition, and prior immune exposure. Additionally, targeted knockout technology has been used in the mouse genome for almost 30 years (Bouabe and Okkenhaug, 2013). While advances in gene editing techniques (e.g., CRISPR) have recently extended these approaches to other species, genetically modified mice have been an unparalleled resource for studying the role of specific genes in the response to a variety of pathogens (Masopust et al., 2017). Furthermore, the use of classical genetic crossing approaches (e.g., intercrosses), as well as reproducible mouse genetic reference populations (GRPs), has facilitated the discovery of key regulators of host immunity and pathogen susceptibility such as the innate immune receptor Tlr4, oligoadenylate-synthetase Oas1b, and divalent metal transporter Nramp1 (Perelygin et al., 2002, Qureshi et al., 1999, Vidal et al., 1993). The recent development of multi-parental GRPs, such as the Collaborative Cross (CC), promises to further extend genetic mapping capabilities, while also leading to the development of mouse models that more accurately reproduce the genetic diversity and phenotypic range seen in human populations (Churchill et al., 2004). This review will summarize recent advances in the use of mouse GRPs, with an emphasis on the use of the CC for studying infectious diseases and immunity.",

Likewise, deleterious mutations in immune genes can result in PIDs, which cause enhanced susceptibility to specific or entire classes of pathogens (Carneiro-Sampaio and Coutinho, 2007). To date, over 350 genetically driven PIDs have been identified in humans (Picard et al., 2018). The identification of these monogenic resistance and susceptibility genes has enhanced our understanding of human immunity and host-pathogen interactions while contributing to the development of antiviral therapies, such as HIV entry inhibitors, as well as gene therapy and immune replacement therapies (Collins and Thrasher, 2015, Lenardo et al., 2016).",

This is supported by results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) designed to map loci associated with variation in pathogen susceptibility and vaccine response. For example, GWAS of HIV viral load have shown that mutations in the HIV co-receptor CCR5 and variants in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) explain approximately 15% of the total variance, with an additional 5% of heritable variance explained by additive effects of other genes (McLaren et al., 2015). GWAS on malaria susceptibility have identified variants in multiple genes including the calcium ATPase ATP2B4, the glucose phosphate dehydrogenase GP6D, and HLAs, as well as confirming previously identified variants in hemoglobin genes (sickle cell and thalassemia) (Hedrick, 2011, Timmann et al., 2012). Multiple loci have been associated with clearance of hepatitis C virus, including the cytokine IL-28b and HLA genes (Duggal et al., 2013), and over 20 loci have been associated with leprosy susceptibility (Wang et al., 2016).",

This is partly attributable to factors such as small cohort sizes, ethnic striations, and lack of replicates, which limit detection and interpretation of results (Du et al., 2012). Rare genetic variants are unlikely to be detected by GWAS, due to both lack of power and lack of tagging on conventional genotyping arrays (Auer and Lettre, 2015). A specific concern for GWAS in infectious diseases is that studies can be confounded by pathogen genetics, pathogen dose, and other environmental factors. Furthermore, validation and mechanistic analysis can be difficult in humans due to factors such as lack of replicates and inability to routinely access many affected tissue types. For these reasons, the use of appropriate animal models has been a critical resource for identifying and studying pathogen susceptibility genes.",

One of the major reasons for the focus on specific strains is the need to control for genetic background when analyzing gene-specific knockouts or performing large-scale mutagenesis screens. Large-scale initiatives such as the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) depend upon the ability to control background strain to analyze the impact of specific gene deletions or mutations on a wide range of developmental and immune phenotypes (Mu\u00f1oz-Fuentes et al., 2018), and have thus generated these mutants on common backgrounds using largely identical procedures. C57BL/6J is the most commonly used inbred mouse strain; it is the source of the mouse reference genome and the genetic background for the majority of knockout mice. Other strains, such as the BALB/c substrains, also have a rich history of use in immunology and infectious disease research (Watanabe et al., 2004). While the ongoing use of such strains is driven by the need to compare results across studies, it is important to note that every inbred strain has a unique set of genetic features, and thus no one strain is representative of all mice, let alone of a genetically complex population such as humans.",

Approximately 15% of genes cannot be knocked out because they are developmentally essential (NIH, 2015). Similarly, other knockouts have no observable phenotype, due to genetic redundancy and/or lack of robustness in the phenotyping pipeline (Barbaric et al., 2007). In other cases, knockouts have disparate phenotypes on different genetic backgrounds due to gene-gene interactions (Doetschman, 2009). Furthermore, gene knockouts result in null alleles (complete loss of gene function), whereas naturally occurring genetic variants are most likely to be hypomorphic or hypermorphic alleles (partial loss or gain of gene function; alterations in timing and magnitude of expression). Lastly, while single-gene approaches are straightforward, they are isolated systems that do not model the simultaneous contribution of variants in multiple pathways, as would most likely be observed in a natural system. Thus, to better model and understand the role of genes in complex phenotypes such as immunity and infectious disease, it is pertinent to consider complex genetic interactions across diverse genetic backgrounds.",

In contrast to mapping crosses between stocks (e.g., F2 crosses), where each mouse is unique and therefore ephemeral, GRPs serve as reproducible models to study the role of genetic diversity. GRPs consist of anywhere from a few to hundreds of inbred lines derived and split from a common ancestral population, and each line has a fixed and known genome that can be replicated indefinitely. The existence of reproducible yet genetically diverse individual mouse strains facilitates study designs that involve case versus control, genotype by environment interactions (GxE), and phenotypic penetrance or threshold traits. These populations further facilitate the integration of phenotypic, genotypic, and molecular data for systems-level data analysis while also allowing retrospective integration of new layers of data.",

In contrast to single-gene approaches, systems genetics considers phenotypes in the context of global genetic variation as well as intermediate molecular factors such as gene expression, protein abundance, and environmental interactions. The resource ultimately derived from this proposal was the CC, a large panel of recombinant inbred strains derived from eight genetically diverse founder strains. The CC was designed to facilitate systems genetics approaches with improved resolution and higher statistical power compared to traditional GRPs, to expand the pool of genetic variation segregating in the population, and to bridge the analysis of genetic and molecular networks across diverse phenotypes (Churchill et al., 2004).",

The other three CC founders are wild-derived inbred strains, which represent the three major subspecies of Mus musculus: casteneus (CAST/EiJ), musculus (PWK/PhJ), and domesticus (WSB/EiJ), and introduce much of the genetic diversity into the CC. These eight founder strains were interbred in a funnel breeding scheme to produce recombinant mice with genomic contributions from each founder, which were then bred to homozygosity to produce recombinant inbred (RI) CC strains (Figure 1\n). Although the initial goal was to produce 1,000 CC strains, only around 100 CC strains survived the inbreeding process due to high rates of infertility and breeding issues, largely caused by genomic incompatibility introduced by the wild-derived strains. Extinction of CC strains during the inbreeding process inspired the creation of the Diversity Outbred (DO) panel, an outbred population derived from a set of incipient CC strains (Churchill et al., 2012). The DO now serves as its own important genetic resource that has proven useful for high-resolution genetic mapping as well as exploration of phenotypic diversity (Chick et al., 2016, Gatti et al., 2014, Smallwood et al., 2014, Shorter et al., 2018). While the DO has only been used in a limited number of infectious disease studies (McHugh et al., 2013, Niazi et al., 2015), the DO and CC should be viewed as complementary resources for studying how genetic variation affects pathogen susceptibility and immunity.",

Due to higher genetic diversity with novel allele combinations and epistatic interactions, the CC yields more phenotypic variation and extreme phenotypes than classical GRPs. The selection of founder strains and the breeding design, as well as higher levels of recombination, result in lower levels of long-range disequilibrium and population structure than classical GRPs, allowing for higher resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (Iraqi et al., 2012, Threadgill et al., 2002).

The application of merge analysis to the CC enables more effective gene refinement compared to studies in classic biparental GRPs, where the presence of only two haplotypes means that every genetic variant in a locus is a putative candidate causal variant.

While disease-associated phenotypes (weight loss, viral titer, and inflammation) were largely correlated, subsets of these pre-CC mice showed breakdowns in these relationships, resulting in novel phenotypic combinations not observed in classical mouse strains (e.g., high weight loss with minimal inflammation). This study identified four significant QTLs, including one strong QTL that explained approximately 42% of IAV-induced weight loss, over the IAV resistance gene Mx1. Importantly, while Mx1 is well studied, the authors identified a novel allelic variant derived from CAST/EiJ that protects from weight loss but less efficiently inhibits viral replication compared to the functional M. musculus musculus-derived allele carried by NZO/HiLtJ and PWK/PhJ. Consistent with Ferris et al.\u2019s finding of a uniquely functional CAST/EiJ Mx1 variant, Leist et al. found that CAST/EiJ mice have a unique response to an H3N2 strain of IAV (Leist et al., 2016). While the Mx1 locus had a dominating effect in the Ferris et al. study, large phenotypic variation occurred within Mx1 classes, suggesting the presence of modifier alleles. Three additional QTLs were mapped when controlling for Mx1 haplotype, corresponding to variation in weight loss, pulmonary edema, and airway neutrophils. Notably, aside from the Mx1 locus, none of the QTLs identified by Ferris et al. matched influenza susceptibility loci found in mapping studies conducted in the BXD population.

Typhimurium) causes typhoid fever, and previous mouse mapping studies have identified multiple loci associated with susceptibility (Roy et al., 2006, Sebastiani et al., 1998). To identify novel loci associated with S. Typhimurium susceptibility, Zhang et al. infected 35 CC RI strains and measured bacterial load in the liver and spleen at 4 days post-infection (Zhang et al., 2018). QTL scans for bacterial load mapped multiple significant or suggestive QTL (Figure 2; Table 1), which differed from those identified in studies conducted in other mapping populations (Roy et al., 2006, Sebastiani et al., 1998). Zhang et al. used merge analysis in combination with immune cell gene expression, gene ontology, and analysis of known protein functions to narrow the list of candidate genes under the two significant loci. They identified candidate genes Cul4a (ubiquitin ligase), Lamp1 (lysosomal membrane protein), Mcf2l (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), Pcid2 (TREX-2 complex component involved in mRNA nuclear export), and a high-priority candidate Slc35f1, which has lactate dehydrogenase activity that may be important in the S. Typhimurium pyruvate metabolism pathway. The study also noted that one strain, CC042/GeniUnc, had extremely high bacterial loads, suggesting that it may be uniquely susceptible to S. Typhimurium.",

Gralinski et al. infected the CC founder strains and 147 pre-CC lines with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV and studied disease through day 4 post-infection (Gralinski et al., 2015). Variation in weight loss and viral titer was significant in the CC founders and even broader in the pre-CC mice. Similar to IAV, phenotypic dissociation was observed in some pre-CC lines, with viral titer not correlated with weight loss. QTL mapping identified a significant main effect QTL, as well as a modifier QTL for vascular cuffing in the lungs, explaining 26% and 21% of the variation, respectively. Suggestive QTLs were identified for eosinophilia (26% of variation) and viral titer (22% of variation) (Figure 2; Table 1). The candidate region for the main effect vascular cuffing QTL was narrowed to a small 450 kb region of shared ancestry between the high-response haplotypes. This region contained only one functional gene, Trim55, a RING zinc-finger-containing protein expressed in smooth muscle, which had not previously been implicated in any immune phenotypes. Follow-up validation studies using Trim55 knockout mice, which showed altered chemokine and tight junction gene expression as well as altered inflammatory cell recruitment, confirmed a role for this gene in SARS-CoV-induced vascular cuffing. The authors also noted a high-priority candidate under the modifier QTL, the cadherin family member Cdhr2, which may be involved in migration of inflammatory cell from the blood into the lung.",

Variation in immune homeostasis has been associated with variation in vaccine responses in humans (Tsang et al., 2014), and the CC provides a novel resource to study how variation in pre-existing immunity affects the host response to infection or vaccination. Phillippi et al. analyzed subsets of lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in the CC founders, CC founder F1s, and 66 pre-CC strains (Phillippi et al., 2014). They observed variation in the pre-CC exceeding that in the founders, as well as novel extreme phenotypes such as lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. While some immune phenotypes were highly correlated, others showed little or no correlation to other immune populations. Mapping identified 10 significant QTLs across 8 phenotypes, including B/T cell ratio and mean fluorescence intensity for CD23, also known as Fc epsilon RII. The CD23 QTL contains the gene Fcer2a, which codes for CD23 itself, and a combination of merge analysis, conditional association, and residue conservation was used to identify specific coding polymorphisms within Fcer2a driving the QTL.",

Rather, we suggest a tiered approach to study design within the CC, starting with a small-scale analysis in a set of strains (e.g., 12\u201316) that sample most of the haplotypes present across the CC genomes, and expanding as necessary. The efficacy of this type of approach is demonstrated by the success of small CC screens that have identified strains with unique phenotypes and proceeded with further targeted studies such as F2 crosses to reveal complex polygenic networks driving the outlier phenotype (Gralinski et al., 2017, Rogala et al., 2014). Furthermore, even when investigators opt for large mapping studies, they may still identify strains with unique outlier phenotypes that cannot be explained by QTLs identified in the initial screen. This missing heritability may be driven by complex genetic interactions such as epistasis, which are difficult to study in complex populations and are more effectively studied in targeted crosses (Rogala et al., 2014).",

These small screens also facilitate estimation of the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by genetics within the test population (heritability), identification of potential confounding factors (e.g., mouse size and activity levels), and performance of power calculations before embarking on a large-scale screen. In contrast to conducting the initial screen in the CC founders, CC strains exhibit more phenotypic diversity due to re-assortment of allelic variants throughout the genome. Furthermore, a specific set of CC strains can be chosen to avoid the presence of large effect resistance genes such as Mx1 or Oas1b that may dominate the response to some pathogens. Likewise, strains can be selected that carry specific gene haplotypes to facilitate specific assays (e.g., MHC haplotypes for antigen-specific T cell analysis) (Graham et al., 2015, Graham et al., 2017).",

Unlike CC mice, which are fully inbred and genotyped, each mouse in an F2 or other intercross mapping population will need to be genotyped. In both cases, genetic mapping should identify a subset of the variants impacting the phenotype of interest (e.g., disease). While an in-depth discussion of mapping methods is beyond the scope of this review, several robust mapping strategies have been successfully applied to the CC, including DOQTL, BAGPIPE, and R/qtl (Arends et al., 2010, Gatti et al., 2014, Valdar et al., 2009). Once QTLs have been mapped, investigators can confirm the underlying haplotype effects by screening additional CC strains with high or low responder haplotypes under the QTLs that were not included in the initial screen, or by screening a set of mice from the related DO population. While not essential, this step confirms the initial mapping studies and provides confidence in the QTL effects prior to embarking on candidate gene investigation.",

            "text": "The identification and validation of candidate genes can be a challenging and intensive process. QTLs are often large, containing tens to hundreds of genes. In contrast to mapping in biparental GRPs or intercross populations, where there are only two haplotypes and every variant is a putative candidate, in the CC, merge analysis (Yalcin et al., 2005) can be used to narrow candidates based on how the pattern of variants (e.g., SNPs or indels) for each founder matches the distribution of phenotypic responses associated with each founder haplotype. As described above, merge analysis has been a useful tool in the CC; however, a drawback of merge analysis is that it assumes a single SNP variant driving the locus. In multi-parental populations, different SNPs or other mutations within the same gene may phenocopy one another (e.g., different Mx1 null alleles; Ferris et al., 2013). Furthermore, other genetic variants (e.g., copy number variants and transposable elements) are often missed by traditional merge databases. Other in silico tools, including baseline tissue and/or haplotype-specific gene expression (e.g., ImmGen and GECCO) (Shay and Kang, 2013; http://csbio.unc.edu/gecco) and protein functional consequence prediction (e.g., SIFT; Sim et al., 2012), can help narrow candidates to a single high-priority candidate gene or small set of candidates (Ferris et al., 2013, Gralinski et al., 2015). Alternatively, if causal variants are suspected of altering transcript levels, de novo gene expression analysis can be used to further refine candidate genes under the locus.",

When the phenotype is driven by an individual cellular factor, such as an antiviral molecule or receptor, gene function can be validated in vitro using techniques such as CRISPR or ectopic expression of different variants. When the phenotype has a more systemic cause, in vivo validation is generally necessary. This can be facilitated by the wide availability of knockout mouse lines (Gralinski et al., 2015, Gralinski et al., 2017). However, in vivo validation studies should take into account factors such as genetic background of the knockout, the effect of the variant, and the distribution of haplotypes (e.g., a knockout on a C57BL/6J background may not provide an interpretable phenotype if, in the CC, the C57BL/6J haplotype is an extreme response haplotype, or if the C57BL/6J allele is hypomorphic or amorphic). More recent advances in CRISPR technology open up the possibility of knocking out or performing allele swaps in genes directly in CC founders or RI strains, enhancing the utility of the CC as a resource for both identifying and studying polymorphic genes affecting pathogen susceptibility or other phenotypes of interest.",

While the role of traditional laboratory strains and genetically modified mice in driving advances in the field cannot be understated, these models do not capture the genetic diversity and phenotypic complexity observed in the natural population. Building on the success of classical intercrosses and biparental GRPs, the CC is a highly diverse and reproducible resource for studying and mapping complex traits, including infectious disease susceptibility. The reproducibility of CC strains will allow the community to cross-compare genes and genetic networks that regulate response across pathogens (e.g., IAV and SARS-CoV; Xiong et al., 2014), while also exploring the impact of factors such as the microbiome, co-infections, and genetic variation of the pathogen in the context of a controlled, genetically diverse model population. The CC also holds promise for the development of new models and testing platforms that will better reproduce specific human disease outcomes or host responses to pathogens and vaccines.",
