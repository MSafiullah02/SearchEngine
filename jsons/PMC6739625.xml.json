As of October 2018, there were Ebola, Cholera, Yellow Fever (YF) and Meningitis outbreaks in nine countries [2]. Vaccines can address health emergencies; however, only 30% of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) globally can perform core regulatory functions to provide efficient oversight of registration, including the assessment, quality control and post-marketing surveillance of vaccines. This can lead to delayed, access to prevention in emergency situations, thus the need to rely on international mechanisms for product regulation, including the WHO Collaborative Registration Procedure (CRP) [3].",

In this context, ensuring simple procurement practices and guaranteed supply, avoiding fragmentation, working on policies and technical advice for countries, as well as stockpiles, should help drive global and regional vaccine uptake, increasing access to vaccines for everyone. In general, some redundancy in manufacturing is needed to ensure economies of scale and sustainable global supply capacity if one factory goes offline. He commended DCVMN companies for exploring state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and stated that BMGF is committed to a strong dialogue and willing to share risks that make a difference to global health.

The CRP is based on principles of cooperation, reliance, harmonization and voluntary information sharing to avoid duplication of efforts, enabling faster and efficient access to quality vaccines while respecting sovereignty and national decision-making. Thus far, 34 countries have accepted the CRP. Since 2013, the CRP has enabled registration of 350 medicines within an average of 90 days, and implementation of its principles contributed to achieving 26 vaccine registrations. In 2017, a Pentavalent was registered in Ethiopia within 6 months, and cholera vaccines were registered in Nigeria and Caribbean countries in 3\u20135 months. Still, there is a need to optimize the CRP for vaccines by better defining priority vaccines and priority countries.",

First, registration procedures could rely on WHO PQ certificates or apply the CRP. Dossier evaluation could rely on batch release data of tests and inspections already conducted by WHO. Registration procedures for non-PQ vaccines could rely on dossiers and data provided by the manufacturing country\u2019s NRA, through mutual recognition agreements, or based on release tests conducted by WHO-contracted laboratories (see U. Rosskopf, above). Second, alignment of dossier numbering systems across countries and regions could be improved by following the ICH CTD\n11 (EU Notice to Applicants) [29], also recognized by WHO. Third, use an application form template (proposed in tabular format), maintaining the three key sections and main subheadings. Fourth, consider pre-submission meetings between the applicant, regulators and post-marketing pharmacovigilance systems to improve registration procedures. Dr. Dellepiane concluded that more regulatory convergence practices can improve registrations and access to vaccines globally.",
