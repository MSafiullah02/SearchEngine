These viruses cause illnesses that can range from a brief upper respiratory tract infection to severe systemic illness resulting in death. The risk of infection is often related to age. Influenza, for example, is known to have its highest attack rates amongst the very young and the very old [McIntyre et al., 2002] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) affects mainly the young, although less typical infections amongst adults are recognized [Hall, 2001] . The risk of infection also depends on pre-existing medical conditions and immunocompetence.",

The use of immunofluorescence-based assays has improved turnaround times, but a nasopharyngeal aspirate is required for optimal results and the method suffers from a limited number of viruses being detectable with the reagents available. The availability of new classes of drugs active against both influenza A and B viruses , preclinical and clinical trials of drugs targeted at respiratory viruses other than influenza [Hayden et al., 2003; Cianci et al., 2004; Uckun et al., 2004] , and the potential for new vaccines [Power et al., 2001] has encouraged further a shorter diagnostic turnaround time for the detection of respiratory viruses. An increasing number of diagnostic laboratories use polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays to rapidly identify a wide range of viruses in specimens collected from a variety of respiratory sites [Billaud et al., 2003; Echavarria et al., 2003; Vuorinen et al., 2003] .",

Clinical material sent for laboratory testing from hospitalized patients included nose swabs, throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs), bronchial washings, lung biopsies, sputum samples, and pleural fluids. Nose and throat swabs (NTS) pooled into viral transport medium were received from surveillance patients. They were only taken from individuals with symptoms of 3 days or less of fever, cough, and fatigue. When multiple samples from a single patient were sent for testing, only one result was included in the analysis. A total of 333 additional respiratory specimens, including 20 from asymptomatic laboratory staff was used to validate the PCR assays for influenza A virus (H1 and H3 subtypes), influenza B virus, RSV, parainfluenza viruses (at least one of types 1-3), picornaviruses (a mixture of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses), and adenoviruses (each of different serotype) (Table III) .",

The process included the design and evaluation of primers; optimization of nucleic acid extraction conditions; establishment of optimum PCR amplification conditions; evaluation of applicable specimen types; determination of assay sensitivity compared to conventional assays; specificity testing using clinical material likely to be negative (including asymptomatic staff volunteers); or material previously shown to be positive for respiratory viruses by conventional assays or by sequencing of an amplified product where no other confirmatory method was available. Because of the lack of immunofluorescence and routine isolation methods to confirm PCR positivity for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus type OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and human coronavirus type 229E (HCoV-229E), sequencing of the PCR-amplified products of these viruses was carried out with the same second round primers used to derive the product.

The approach of using a non-human virus as an internal inhibition control has been reported previously [Druce et al., 2002] . Viral nucleic acid was extracted using one of two commercially available methods. The preferred method used a Magnapure LC automated extraction robot with a Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). This involved the extraction of viral nucleic acid from 200 ml of the clinical material in viral transport medium, with elution into a final volume of 50 ml of the supplied elution buffer. Specimens containing inhibitors of the PCR as shown by failure of the BVDV internal control to amplify were reextracted through a column (Highpure Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Column; Roche Diagnostics) and retested. Ten microliters of RNA was linearized for 10 min at 658C, added to 12 ml of reverse transcription master mix consisting of random hexamers (Roche Diagnostics), dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinhamshire, UK), and AMV-RT enzyme and buffers (Promega, Madison, WI) and incubated for 30 min at 428C followed by 10 min at 1008C. The cDNA product was stored at 48C until tested. Adenovirus DNA extracted by either of the above methods survived this process (results not shown).",

Tube 2 included RSV [Osiowy, 1998 ] and picornaviruses (with primers specific for all enteroviruses and rhinoviruses) [Ireland et al., 1993] . Tube 3 included parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3. Tube 4 included HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, and tube 5 included hMPV only. When required, a separate PCR assay was used to distinguish enteroviruses from rhinoviruses when the picornavirus component of tube 2 was positive [Zoll et al., 1992; Steininger et al., 2001] . A negative control of nuclease-free water was included in every assay and a virus positive control consisting of low copy number cDNA (or DNA for adenovirus) included in the relevant PCR targeting that virus. The primers used for first and second round amplifica-tions, and their gene/product targets, are listed in Table II . For first round amplification, 3 ml of cDNA template was added to 40 ml of a mastermix containing 500 nM first round primers (100 nM for the picornavirus primers), 1.8 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM dNTPs and 0.3 U of Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The first round PCR conditions consisted of one cycle of 948C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 948C (30 sec), 558C (30 sec), 728C (60 sec), then 728C for 5 min. The conditions for tube 2 were reduced to 20, 20, and 30 sec, respectively, for cycles 2-36. For second round amplification, 2 ml of the first round product was transferred to fresh mastermix containing second round primers. The second round PCR amplification conditions were the same as for round 1 except the 35 cycle component for tube 2 was reduced to 25 cycles and the annealing temperature reduced to 508C. Separation of amplified material and molecular weight markers (Roche Diagnostics) was performed by electrophoresis for 30 min at 80 mA on a 2% agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide. Gels were photographed using a Gel Doc 2000 (Biorad, Hercules, CA).",

There were more specimens received from females (53.6%) than males (46.4%) participating in the surveillance program. Conversely, 59.7% of specimens from hospitals were from male patients. The overall respiratory virus detection rate was higher in specimens received from surveillance patients than hospital patients in both years (54% and 49% in 2002 and 2003, respectively, for surveillance patients compared to 30% and 33%, respectively, for hospital patients). Experiments carried out during the development and validation process showed that it was not possible to incorporate all the required primers into a single tube assay without significant loss of sensitivity for some viruses (results not shown). Overall, the PCR assays developed were able to detect at least 0.1 tissue culture infectious dose (50%) using the methods described (results not shown). The sensitivity of the influenza A virus and influenza B virus PCR components was 86% and 87%, respectively, compared to the combined conventional assays of immunofluorescence and virus isolation (Table III) . However, additional testing using matrix specific primers (not shown) confirmed that the influenza virus PCR positive/conventional test negative samples were true positives. The true sensitivity for influenza A was therefore 89.5% (95% CI, 66.9-98.7) and specificity 100% (95% CI, 98.9-100). For influenza B the sensitivity was 90.0% (95% CI, 67.1-98.8) and specificity 100% (95% CI, 98.9-100). A total of 44 specimens were positive for picornaviruses by PCR but negative by virus isolation, the only conventional test available. Positive results for picornaviruses were confirmed using enterovirus-and rhinovirus-specific primers, giving an assay sensitivity for picornaviruses of 100% (95% CI, 92.5-100) and specificity 100% (95% CI, 98.7-100). Although based on small numbers in some instances, the sensitivity of the PCR assays for each of RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses was 100% (Table III) . The 20 specimens collected from asymptomatic volunteer staff were negative in each of the PCR assays. Figure 1 . All viruses for which a PCR was available were detected during this time. Overall, respiratory viruses were detected in 1,583 (37%) of 4,254 specimens received for testing. The virus detection rates for 2002 and 2003 during the surveillance period (May-September) and the official winter months of June-August are shown in Table IV . A greater proportion of viruses were detected in surveillance patients in both years during these overlapping times. The average winter detection rate of 40% in hospitalized patients decreased to 22% in the summer of 2002/3. Influenza A virus was the most common virus detected (Fig. 1) . Discrete winter peaks occurred in both years, with activity for this virus being greater in 2003 than 2002. Identification of influenza A virus was rare outside the peak incidence times of May-September.",

Although RSV was detected most commonly in hospitalized children as expected, it was also detected regularly in adults. RSV has been shown previously to contribute to community and hospital cases of influenza-like illnesses [Zambon et al., 2001] . The role of the newly identified hMPV was investigated only in 2003. This virus was associated mainly with hospitalized cases, suggesting that it may be clinically distinguishable from influenza infection in the community setting. It was less common in older children and teenagers than in infants, young children and adults. A similar epidemiological pattern has been reported in other parts of the world [Falsey et al., 2003] , but more detailed studies on the epidemiology of this virus are warranted. Coronaviruses, which have been reported to cause up to 35% of all cases of the common cold [McIntosh, 1997] , and are associated with hospitalizations among older adults [Falsey et al., 2002] , accounted for a few cases of influenza-like illness, particularly in younger children, but otherwise were present in only 6% of surveillance patients and 12% of hospitalized patients. The role of HCoV-OC43 in causing discrete outbreaks in elderly residents of aged-care facilities has been described [Birch et al., in press] , and further studies on the impact of the newly recognized HCoV-NL63 are needed.",

            "text": "Because the diagnostic testing algorithm involved multiple targets, it was anticipated that some samples would contain more than one virus. Most of the viruses were identified on a prolonged background of adenovirus and picornavirus activity throughout the 2 year period. It is not surprising therefore that these viruses were most commonly detected as part of dual infections. Rhinoviruses have been previously shown to occur commonly with RSV in cases of acute bronchiolitis in infancy and to increase the risk for severe disease [Papadopoulos et al., 2002] . The availability of PCR technology now provides the opportunity for prospective studies on the epidemiology and clinical impact of dual infection with respiratory viruses.",

However, the influenza surveillance program shows that other viruses, especially rhinoviruses, are often associated with symptoms of cough, fever, and fatigue. We found relatively low levels of coronaviruses in both years, in contrast to previous reports. This study contributes to the demonstration of the importance of PCR in the investigation of the epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. PCR assays provide an opportunity to identify new viruses and detect those which do not replicate reliably in cultured cells. They also provide a rapid and sensitive means of diagnosis which may impact on the treatment and duration of hospitalization in many cases.
