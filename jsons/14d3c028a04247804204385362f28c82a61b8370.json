            "text": "Extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or extracorporeal life support (ECLS), is a therapy that uses a modified partial cardiopulmonary bypass to give pulmonary or cardiac support over an extended period of time, generally ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. It is used on patients with reversible pulmonary failure caused by lung, heart, and other diseases. ECMO 'makes time' for resting the lungs or heart, thus creating a chance for recovery. Since ECMO therapy is invasive, there are potential risks associated with it, which is why there are criteria to choose patients with a prediction of mortality between 50% and 100%. The ideal candidate has a high value in their prediction of mortality but suffers from a potentially reversible lung or cardiovascular injury.",

This therapy was, however, abandoned because of its poor results. Years later, the therapy reemerged for newborn and pediatric patients due to Robert Bartlett's efforts, who in 1975, at Orange County Medical Center, treated his first newborn patient who survived this type of therapy, an abandoned newborn who suffered from respiratory distress syndrome. The use of this therapy on newborns increased during the late 1980s, with survival rates close to 80% in patients with a predicted mortality between 60% and 80%. Because of this increase in usage on newborn patients, a voluntary alliance between active ECMO centers was born in 1989, giving form to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). Added to the good results in newborns since the 1990s, there has been a considerable increase in pediatric patients treated with ECMO, with over 14,000 registered cases, claiming a survival rate of up to 66% in pediatric patients suffering from respiratory conditions.",

It is worth noting that survival rate in pediatric patients varies according to the disease that determined the connection, with survival rates reported as high as 83% for severe asthma attack. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure is the most frequent pathophysiological mechanism leading to respiratory ECMO, of which viral pneumonia takes first place (22%), followed by respiratory failure (18%), bacterial pneumonia (10%), acute respiratory distress, and aspiration pneumonia. Acute viral pneumonia shows a survival rate of up to 70% as described for VRS, with an average of 64% for viral pneumonia. Survival rates are also high in the pediatric group for aspiration pneumonia and post-traumatic ARDS (Fig. 73 .5). Patients are oftentimes admitted because of immunosuppression and suspected sepsis. These patients usually display multi-organ failure. Pediatric patients with the worst prognosis are those who have received bone marrow transplants, those who have suffered from Bordetella pertussis induced pneumonia and pulmonary hypertension, and those admitted to ECMO with multi-organ failure, as opposed to the positive prognosis for those who only show isolated lung involvement.",

Then it passes through a heat exchanger and finally returns the blood to the patient's blood flow ( Fig. 73.6 ). This therapy requires anticoagulation of the circuit and the patient through heparin administered to the ECMO circuit so as to avoid the activation of the coagulation cascade in the system. In addition to that, a variety of pressure, flow, bubble, and temperature monitors are used during therapy. It is of vital importance to continually monitor coagulation through the hourly measurement of activated clotting time (ACT) and the measurement of anti-factor Xa, fibrinogen, platelet count, PT, APTT and, in some patients, anti-thrombin III levels, and a thromboelastography.

VA ECMO provides heartlung support. It is common to use a transthoracic cannula (right ventricle and aortic cannula) in patients who have endured heart operations. (b) Veno-venous (VV): Blood is drained from the right atrium through the posterior and inferior orifices of a double-lumen cannula inserted into the right jugular vein and returned to the same right ventricle through the anterior orifices of the cannula, which are pointed toward the tricuspid valve. One of the limits of this method lies in the recirculation of already oxygenized blood through the double lumen cannula. This has been corrected with the new design for VV cannulas. VV ECMO may also be performed in older children through the use of two cannulas, draining blood from the jugular vein and returning it through the femoral vein. VV ECMO requires a well-functioning heart. This modality of ECMO prevents cannulation in the carotid or femoral arteries, thus reducing complications arising from cannulation or ligation of these arteries, as well as those arising from air entering the ECMO circuit. This method has seen an increase in usage during recent years, covering 40% and 50% of respiratory cases in newborn and pediatric patients, respectively. Oxygen is delivered during ECMO by the combination of blood oxygenation through the membrane, blood flowing through the extracorporeal circuit, native lung oxygenation, and native heart output. In turn, oxygenation at the ECMO membrane is a function of its geometry, material composition and thickness, blood and FiO 2 laminar thickness, time of permanence of red blood cells in the exchange area, hemoglobin concentration, and O 2 saturation. On the other hand, CO 2 removal during ECMO is a function of the geometry, materials, and surface area of the membrane, blood PCO 2 and, to a lesser extent, it depends on blood and gas flows through the membrane.",

In this way, as the blood flow to the extracorporeal circuit increases, the pulse wave decreases, completely ceasing when it reaches a 100% bypass, except for occasional waves. However, it is normal for VA ECMO to only involve about an 80% bypass, allowing a blood flow of 20% or more through the left heart and lungs, resulting in a reduced but visible pulse wave. The kidney is without doubt the most affected organ by the absence of pulsatility, producing an antidiuretic effect because of juxtaglomerular stimulation. In addition, non-pulsatile flow has been linked to stimulation of the pressure receptors in the carotid sinus, causing a large release of catecholamines, with damaging effects to microcirculation.",

On the other hand, there are general exclusion criteria (Table 73. 3), though none of them are absolute and must be discussed by the ECMO team. In summary, selection criteria have evolved and continue to do so as a result of discussion, debate, experience, and the emergence of new treatments and techniques. Currently, there are no unique or exclusive criteria, and not withstanding general inclusion criteria, the decision to exclude a patient must be discussed by the team, taking into account all possible points of view, without excluding any party from this discussion.",

Work began in 1999 with the formation of a multidisciplinary team (composed of neonatologists, intensive care pediatricians, cardiac and pediatric surgeons, nurses, perfusionists, respiratory therapists, and psychologists) that had undergone training in ECMO centers affiliated with ELSO in the United States. At the same time, ECMO equipment was procured in order to establish the first ECMO units according to ELSO recommendations. The main selection criteria applied were: reversibility of lung or heart condition, failure to respond to maximum conventional treatment, weight 3 of 2 kg, gestational age of 34 weeks, oxygenation index >40, mechanical ventilation <14 days, and absence of severe brain injury or multi-organ failure. This is the first ECMO program in Latin America to join ELSO. From May 2003 to December 2014, the program treated 143 patients for both severe respiratory and cardiac pathologies. Of these patients, 77% survived till hospital discharge and are currently being monitored. The 35 patients who died had as base diseases: CDH (n = 13), congenital heart disease operated with failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass or arrhythmias (n = 9), persistent pulmonary hypertension secondary to sepsis, pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, SP-B or ABCA3 deficiency or without a defined cause (n = 12), and pneumonia due to Bordetella pertussis (n = 1). Among patients treated with ECMO, a relevant group of children treated with CDH stands out with a survival rate of 78% (45/48) at discharge.",

Data compiled from treatment of 259 newborns were analyzed, resulting in a significant increase in survival rate, from 72% before ECMO to 89% during the ECMO period. During the ECMO period, 98 out of 159 patients with respiratory failure (62%) were rescued using iNO or HFOV, while 61 (38%) did not improve their condition; 52 out of these 61 patients underwent ECMO treatment.

These will have to be simpler, automatic, and with a lower need for anticoagulants so as to minimize risks and make its extended use possible. In that way newborns and children with severe conditions can be submitted to ECLS while waiting for heart or lung transplant, or as a bridge for ventricular assistance devices. Even premature newborns with severe cardiopulmonary failure can benefit from partial umbilical ECLS in the future. New low-resistance micropore oxygenators will not require the use of a pump, with the umbilical artery and vein used as an arteriovenous shunt. Moreover, newborns with CDH could go through an early ECLS admission in order to minimize lung damage and promote lung growth, using, for instance, growth factors or liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbon associated with ECLS. Some centers, such as Boston Children's Hospital, have applied ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) to ECMO for patients either with CDH and prenatal markers of poor prognosis, or in order to ensure an effective ventilation of newborns who do not possess a safe airway or for whom it is expected suffer from severe respiratory failure at birth (CDH, cervical teratoma, airway pathologies, large pulmonary masses, bronchial cysts, etcetera).",
