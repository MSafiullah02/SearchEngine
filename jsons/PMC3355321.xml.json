Based on its high resolution and reproducibility as compared with conventional electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis was employed to monitor cleavage in subsequent experiments. When the kinetics of the response were measured, DON at 1000 ng/ml was found to cause rRNA cleavage as early as 2 h that was very robust by 6 h (Figure 2A). Cleavage at 6 h was concentration dependent with 200 ng/ml of DON evoking modest rRNA cleavage as compared with more marked rRNA cleavage induced by 1000 ng/ml (Figure 2B).

Cells were incubated with SG and anisomycin, which can freely diffuse through cell membrane and ricin, a RIP, which can enter the cells by endocytosis and retrograde translocation to ER and cytosol. Unlike SG and anisomycin that directly bind to ribosome to inhibit translation, ricin possesses inherent RNA N-glycosidase activity to depurinate RNA. Although these toxins have apparently different mechanisms for inhibiting translation, SG, anisomycin, and ricin induced a similar apoptosis-mediated cleavage profile to that of DON (Fig. 8), suggesting that ribotoxins might share conserved pathway for mediating rRNA cleavage.",

Although RNase L is activated by a number of stressors, its only known endogenous direct activator is 2-5A, a product of oligoadenylate synthetase (Pandey et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2006). Upon binding to 2\u20135A, RNase L is activated by dimerization and possibly inhibits protein synthesis via the degradation of both messenger RNA and 28S rRNA (Clemens and Vaquero, 1978; Wreschner et al., 1981). We found that under cell-free conditions in the presence of 2-5A, RNase L readily cleaved both FRET probe and purified rRNA; however, it did not degrade rRNA in purified whole ribosomes (see supplementary fig. 1). Furthermore, transfection of 2-5A and RNase L activator (RLA) into RAW 264.7 cells did not induce rRNA cleavage. Thus, increased RNase L activity alone might likely be insufficient for inducing rRNA cleavage in RAW 264.7.",

The data presented here do not support this hypothesis. First, PKR and Hck are activated by DON within minutes (Zhou et al., 2003b, 2005b), whereas DON-induced rRNA cleavage was detectable only after 2 h and required relatively higher DON concentrations. Second, suppression of DON-induced rRNA cleavage by PKR, Hck, and p38 inhibitors suggests that their activation is an upstream rather than downstream event. We therefore propose an alternative hypothesis in which entry of DON into the cell rapidly disrupts the conformation of rRNA yielding accessible intact hairpin loops at the surface of ribosome that would be capable of activating PKR or other double-stranded RNA\u2013binding proteins. These events would initiate a stress response that would, especially at high toxin concentrations, ultimately drive rRNA cleavage in concert with apoptosis. This hypothesis is highly consistent with the growing recognition that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) initiate noninfectious innate immune and inflammatory responses (Newton and Dixit, 2012).",

It is thus important to note that DON activated caspases 8 and 9, both of which can activate caspase 3, suggesting the involvement of both apoptotic pathways, respectively, in rRNA cleavage. Caspases mediate degradation of some ribosomal-associated proteins, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2\u03b1, eIF3/p35, eIF4B, and eIF4G family (Clemens et al., 2000). This proteolytic action might expose ribosome-embedded rRNA to constitutive and inducible RNases, resulting in the highly selective cleavage observed here.",

It was remarkable that ricin, which possesses N-glycosidase enzymatic activity for 28S rRNA depurination, induced the identical rRNA cleavage profile to that of DON and two other low molecular weight translational inhibitors, SG and anisomycin. Possibly, in all four cases, toxin-mediated ribosome damage activated a canonical apoptosis-associated rRNA cleavage pathway. Future work should focus on understanding how DON mediates PKR activation, identifying critical executing caspases and RNases, ascertaining whether induction of rRNA cleavage by other ribotoxins or apoptosis-inducing agents is mediated by the same intracellular signaling pathways as well as validating these findings in animal models.",
