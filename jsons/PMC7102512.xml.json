Between 2004 and 2009, the incidence of severe sepsis increased by approximately 13 % annually, while the case-fatality rate decreased steadily [2]. Over $16.7 billion is spent within hospitals and on healthcare for patients with severe sepsis annually\u2014an average of $22,000 per case [1]. The rising incidence, total mortality rate, and costs associated with severe sepsis continue to create major medical challenges. Understanding predisposing factors for worse outcomes in severe sepsis patients may aid accurate risk stratification and promote proper utilization of early, targeted treatment protocols [3].",

The relationship between BMI and adverse patient outcomes is an increasingly important area of research across all areas of medicine due to the growing incidence of obesity in the United States and around the world [4]. Increased BMI has been shown to be a significant risk factor for chronic health conditions including diabetes, hypertension, degenerative joint disease and congestive heart failure. As the association between BMI and adverse chronic health conditions continues to be studied, further efforts are needed to elucidate the relationship between increased BMI and adverse outcomes in critical care situations, including severe sepsis and septic shock. Increased risks associated with extremely high and extremely low BMI exist for broadly defined populations and have generated U-shaped curves relating BMI and mortality [5]. This relationship, however, may not be observed in critically ill patients, where studies have yielded conflicting results [6\u201313]. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data have demonstrated either: an increased risk in underweight, low BMI (<18.5 kg/m2) patients [6, 7], an increased risk in obese, high BMI (>30 kg/m2) patients [8, 9], no significant difference associated with BMI [10\u201313], or a decreased risk in obese, high BMI patients [14].",

Baseline vital signs and laboratory measurements were used to calculate the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, creatinine clearance (CrCl, calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation,) and sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) [25]. Height and weight were obtained from the admission record, procedure notes, or ICU flow sheets and used to calculate BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). 28-day, 60-day, and 1-year mortality were obtained from the hospital record and confirmed via the social security death index (SSDI).

Furthermore, along with the obese group, morbidly obese patients present much more frequently with severe sepsis due to skin or soft tissue infections than do those with lower BMIs.

How this affects the innate inflammatory response to diverse infectious pathogens is unclear. Also, innate inflammation may be altered in obese patients compared to those with a normal BMI. For example, similar alterations in mRNA and down-regulation in gene expression in adipose tissue are observed in obese patients and in experimental human endotoxemia [31].

Prior studies have been performed in diverse settings in diverse patient populations of varying severity of illness, and use different BMI cut-offs to define underweight and obesity. For example, a prospective cohort study (1,698 subjects) of patients admitted to six medical-surgical ICUs in France demonstrates an increased mortality for BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (OR 1.63; CI 1.11\u20132.39) and a decreased mortality for patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 (OR 0.60; CI 0.40\u20130.88) [6]. Similarly, a large multi-institutional ICU database (41,011 patients) shows an association between low BMI (<20 kg/m2) and increased mortality, but no differences in other BMI groups including the obese [7]. More recently, a large multicenter study (3,902 patients) from 24 ICUs in Italy demonstrates that being overweight or obese is associated with a decreased mortality in patients admitted to the ICU [29]. Similarly, utilizing a database of Medicare patients with severe sepsis, Powell and colleagues recently demonstrate that obese (OR 0.59, CI 0.39\u20130.88) and morbidly obese (OR 0.46, CI 0.16\u20130.80) severe sepsis patients have a lower mortality when compared to normal weight comparators [14].",

First, due to the retrospective design of our study, 10 % of patients who had severe sepsis during the study period were excluded due to missing BMI data. In addition, our retrospective design is potentially prone to selection and ascertainment bias. However, excluded patients were comparable to the included cohort in terms of age and severity of illness (Appendix 2\u20133). Second, the use of admission height and weight for BMI calculations is another potential limitation. Patient weight at presentation to the ED, or upon arrival to a hospital floor, will vary the degree of dehydration and the volume of fluid resuscitation delivered in the ED. This is likely to generate a non-differential bias given that processes of care in the ED did not differ by BMI, and weights were recorded prior to knowledge of the primary outcome. Further, BMI may not be an accurate predictor of risks associated with obesity, and a component of BMI may reflect volume overload not obesity in patients with congestive heart failure and other diseases. More nuanced analyses of the relationship between obesity and mortality may be obtained if a measure of functional status is included in the analysis, [33] or if the waist circumference is measured in addition to BMI [34]. We did not collect information on recent weight loss, and a recent weight loss of 10 % in a morbidly obese or underweight patient may compromise health and confer increased risk. Further, we did not collect data on nutrition consumed during hospitalization, and variations in the percent of daily requirements actually received during critical illness may have implications about outcomes. In addition, despite having a final cohort of 1,191 patients, the number of patients in the underweight group (102 patients), and combined obese and morbidly obese group (308 patients), may have been underpowered to find differences between them and other groups that were actually present thus producing a Type II error. Using a database of severe sepsis patients with a wide range of disease severity concentrated the primary outcome in a smaller cohort of patients, and this may have biased toward no difference in mortality being found between BMI categories. Finally, as a single-center study, the results may not be generalizable to other centers with different patient populations.",
