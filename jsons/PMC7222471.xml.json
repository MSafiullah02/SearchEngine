            "text": "Central nervous system infections (CNS infections) refers to inflammations of brain and spinal cord caused by various pathogenic microbes, including meningitis, encephalitis, abscess and etc. Despite continuously improving diagnostic and treatment skills, CNS infections still compose a considerable portion of human morbidity and mortality, and it is estimated that nearly 320,000 people died from meningitis in 2016 [1]. Timely identification of causative agents is critical for the administration of effective treatment and difficulties in this area still exist. Traditional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture can identify approximately 30\u201340% CNS infections (including meningitis and encephalitis) [2], and some study even reported 80\u201390% detection rate in acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis patients [3]. However, in developing countries like China, the detection rate of CSF culture in meningitis ranges 5.4\u201324.3% from updated surveys [4\u20137]. The early use of antibiotics in community or emergency department decrease the positive rate of CSF culture. What\u2019s more, lower positive rate in the post-operation meningitis patients might owe to postoperative reaction [6]. Further, CSF culture in blood bottle might improve positive rate, which is not in place in many hospitals. Other diagnostic methods including tissue biopsy, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and Filmarray meningitis/encephalitis Panel have shown that they could, to some extent, improve diagnostic ability [2, 8], however, these methods are either invasive or are restricted to a limited number of suspected microorganisms.",

To date, several studies have addressed value of mNGS in finding out pathogens and minimizing time of empirical treatment without pathogenic evidence [9\u201320]. In 2017, mNGS was recommended in \u2018Guidelines on the management of infectious encephalitis in adults\u2019 of France as Level 1 evidence to assist clinical decision in CNS infections [21]. However, most previous studies have only focused on clinical cases caused by novel or rare pathogens. Therefore, we conducted an adult prospective study in mainland China to compare diagnostic value between mNGS and conventional methods during CNS infections, and we aimed to elucidate clinical optimization of mNGS in CNS infections as well.",

We defined CNS infections as patients who fit clinical criteria with or without etiology criteria (including positive CSF culture of pathogenic microbes and positive result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) guided by Filmarray meningitis/encephalitis Panel, specific antibody tests and etc.). Second, we calculated mNGS sensitivity compared to culture, mNGS sensitivity compared to culture = mNGS-positive/culture-positive. Then the specificity compared to clinical diagnosis was statistically evaluated, namely specificity compared to clinical diagnosis = mNGS-negative/Clinical diagnosed non-infections. Third, the comparative performance measures of mNGS relative to conventional testing are reported as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement with the composite criteria. Then, we categorized CNS infections according to different types of causative pathogens (bacteria, virus, fungi and parasite) and further calculated detection rate of mNGS. Moreover, mNGS positive/Case consistent was defined as potential pathogen detected by mNGS that is in consistency with final diagnosis, while mNGS positive/Case inconsistent means inconsistency results between mNGS results and final diagnosis. mNGS negative/Case consistent evidence was provided by consistency between negative mNGS results and final diagnosis at the same time. mNGS negative/Case inconsistent means missed potential pathogen detection of mNGS when comparing to final diagnosis.",

Empirical antibiotics usage would significantly lower detection rate of conventional methods by approximately 20% while that of mNGS was not affected. However, further analysis showed that if delayed-sampling after effective antimicrobial therapy is more than 4 days, it could decrease the mNGS detection rate significantly. The reason behind this phenomenon may likely be due to the different diagnostic mechanisms that lies behind. Previous researches have shown that the detection rate of CSF culture in meningitis could be reduced to 9\u201311% after effective treatment [28, 29], due to the fact that culture requires the existence of livable pathogens and therefore is easily influenced by the administration of antimicrobial treatment. High-throughput sequencing, on the other hand, need only to identify DNA fragments of microorganisms, which might be the reason for its relatively higher detection rate after treatment. Nevertheless, our study could draw the conclusion that timely sampling of the CSF is a crucial factor in increasing the detection rate during CNS infections.",

Fungi had relatively hard-to-break cell walls, which may restrain extraction of pathogen DNA segments. RNA viruses such as Japanese B encephalitis virus require reverse transcription before deep sequencing and therefore the amount of the DNA segments might be reduced.

Another interesting finding revealed that mNGS positive/Case consistent group had a significantly higher WBC level, protein level and lower CSF/serum glucose ratio than mNGS negative/Case inconsistent group. The reason behind may be that a more severe disease condition usually indicates the existence of larger loads of microorganisms, which would then lead to a positive mNGS report.

If taking cost-effectiveness factor into consideration, mNGS may become a prior choice for these patients. Although more host DNA/RNA exist when CSF WBC count increase [20], higher CSF WBC count might indicate a more active diseases status and higher pathogen loads, leading to higher detection rate.
