According to qualified estimates, every year about half a billion birds migrate from Europe to Africa and back, and a part of them are infested with ticks. Hoogstraal and Kaiser examined 1826 birds during their northward migration in Egypt in the springs of 1960 and 1962: ixodid ticks were found on 10% individuals (about 90% of the ticks were the African subspecies Hyalomma marginatum rufipes). African ticks were also observed on birds in Bulgaria (Amblyomma variegatum, A. hebraeum) and in Azerbaijan (A. lepidum), and Hyalomma marginatum sporadically in Czechland and Finland. Imagoes of African ticks A. variegatum, A. hebraeum and A. gemma were detected on domestic animals in southern Europe (Italy, France, Bulgaria, Crimea) as a consequence of importation of their larval stages with birds. A majority of these exotic ticks cannot finish their developmental cycle under environmental conditions in Europe, but some of them could theoretically infect local vertebrate hosts and give an origin for new natural foci of infections. In addition to birds, also some bats migrate for longer distances (e.g., Miniopterus schreibersii). Further, even insect vectors can be imported with air currents under specific meteorological conditions (e.g. biting midges Culicoides infected with veterinary important arboviruses bluetongue or African horse sickness).",

The idea of this doctrine is based on the fact that the aetiological agents of a number of infectious diseases circulate among free-living vertebrates and blood-sucking arthropods in nature absolutely independently of man, being an integral component of particular ecosystems. Man can acquire the disease when entering the natural focus after contact with the host or the vector of the disease, but he/she is a \u201cdead end\u201d host of the enzootic cycle. The natural foci of many diseases are closely related to specific ecosystems or biomes. For instance, foci of TBE/RSSE and HFRS (bound to taiga, and mixed forests of the mild Eurasian zone), sandfly fever and Mediterranean tick typhus (macchia ecosystem), CCHF (xerothermic pastures), cutaneous leishmaniasis and tick recurrent fever (desert and semidesert ecosystems), KFD and scrub typhus (tropical rainforest).

The foci are not stable for years, they evolve due to changes in biocenoses that affect fluctuation in valence, decline or origin of the natural foci. For instance, it is well known that a drainage in a landscape decreases activity of natural foci of tularaemia while area (re)forestation increases the valence of LB foci (northeast US states). Nowadays, the most important factor in the evolution of natural foci is not a natural succession of habitats but man with his \u201canthropic\u201d activity (pasturing, deforestation, reforestation, draining, irrigation, building of water reservoirs, landscaping, etc.) resulting in \u201canthropisation\u201d of the landscape. We can distinguish eubiocenoses (hardly affected by man), agrobiocenoses (farmland), and anthropobiocenoses (human habitats and urban ecosystem). A more detailed differentiation of countryside according to the land-use rate suggested Rosick\u00fd and Hejn\u00fd (1959) for Europe: natural landscape \u2013 practically only the tops of high mountains (no natural foci of diseases occur);landscape slightly affected by human activity \u2013 for instance mountain areas (virtually without haematophagous vectors except for the Mediterranean: natural foci of leptospirosis or, in southern Europe, some arboviroses); examples outside Europe: HPS (North America);landscape moderately affected by human activity \u2013 e.g. flood-plain forests or some less cultivated forests (natural foci of tularaemia or TBE);landscape markedly affected by man \u2013 a major proportion of countryside in Europe (foci of TBE, LB, leptospirosis, etc.);fully cultivated landscape (farmland: Q fever, brucellosis, tularaemia);landscape devastated by pasture, air pollution, mining (Mycobacterium kansasii infections), exploitation or dumping grounds;urbanized landscape \u2013 the urban ecosystem, consisting of: \u201ccity\u201d \u2013 pericentre \u2013 residential areas \u2013 suburban areas. A number of zoonoses occur even in urban biocenoses, e.g. LB (city parks), psittacocis (Chlamydophila psittaci), toxoplasmosis (feral pigeons and cats as the source) or dermatophytosis caused by Microsporum canis (cat and dog). Pets or \u201ccompanion animals\u201d (cat, dog, horse, etc.) and synanthropic vertebrates (mouse, rats, feral pigeon, etc.) play a considerable role in their circulation in urban cycles.For examples of natural foci of zoonotic diseases, see Photos 5.1\u20135.49.\n",
