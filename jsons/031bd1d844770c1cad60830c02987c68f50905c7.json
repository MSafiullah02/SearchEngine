Herbal medicine involves the use of the stalks, roots, leaves, flowers, and berries of several different plant species for medical treatment. Many practitioners believe that herbal medication has no side effects because of its natural origin. Thus, herbal medication has been used for a long time with little awareness of its side effects. However, there is an increasing incidence of interstitial pneumonia due to a drug-induced lung injury (DLI), which could be induced by common drugs. Moreover, increasing cases of bronchiolitis obliterans and pulmonary hypertension are being reported; further, these are drug-induced conditions. Clinicians should be more aware of DLI symptoms caused by herbal medication and interrogate patients regarding their use of herbal medication and supplements as well as prescription drugs.",

Moreover, herbal medicine includes several plant components (Table 13 .2). Some of these components cannot be absorbed in the intestine. A DLST test is performed in vitro; therefore, the component that is not present in the blood in vivo can react with the lymphocytes in vitro (i.e., a false-positive result). For example, Sho-Saiko-To (SST) can directly stimulate lymphocytes, thereby resulting in a false-positive result [4, 6] . Nakayama reported that a DLST for SST was positive in 27.5% of healthy controls [6] .

Shimodaira reported in 2000 that ogon, kanzo, and shokyo are commonly involved in lung injury after a review of 488 patients administered with herbal medication [16] .",
