The subfamily Densovirinae includes only arthropod-infecting viruses, while Parvovirinae contains human and other vertebrate-infecting viruses. The Parvovirinae subfamily is currently subdivided into 8 genera (Cotmore et al., 2014). Among DNA viruses, parvoviruses exhibit the highest mutation rate, almost comparable to that possessed by RNA viruses, furthermore they are extremely prone to recombination (Decaro et al., 2009, Shackelton et al., 2007). Parvoviruses are associated with a wide spectrum of acute and chronic diseases in humans and animals, with at least five known groups (Dependoviruses, Parvovirus B19, Human bocaviruses, Parv4 viruses and recently described Bufaviruses) infecting humans (Brown, 2010, Phan et al., 2012).",

Hungarian BtBV sequences were highly similar to those viruses detected previously from bats in China (unpublished data, GenBank accession numbers: KC154061 and KC154060), which therefore are also related to bufavirus sequences. Although the Hungarian viruses were closely related to bufaviruses, they formed a separate monophyletic branch (Fig. 2B and C). Phylogeny revealed that bat-related bufaviruses might have had common unknown ancestors with bufaviruses identified from humans so far. In a recent publication, a novel parvovirus (WUHARV) was described in nonhuman primates, which were most closely related to bufavirus 2 genotype (Handley et al., 2012). Based on recombination analyses (Fig. 3\n), an intragenic recombination event was detected in the viral protein segment, which assumes that this nonhuman primate bufavirus might be a result of past recombination event between bat and human bufaviruses.",

The discovery of this novel BtBV along with the detailed molecular and recombination analyses expands our knowledge on the evolutionary history of bufaviruses and widens the list of human infecting viruses with possible bat origin. The shared evolutionary history between primate and bat bufaviruses seems to be interesting; however, the zoonotic transmission potential and the possible health risk posed by the newly described virus remains to be determined. High mutation rate and ability to recombination may facilitate fast evolution of bufaviruses, which might be quaint enough for investigate with further molecular characterization of both human and animal related bufavirus genomes.",
