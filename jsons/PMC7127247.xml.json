However, the increasing consumption of poultry meat other than chicken is driving a concomitant increase in the economic importance of other poultry species, including turkeys. There is a subsequent need for improved vaccination strategies, and therefore a greater understanding of the immune systems of these species (Kaiser, 2010, Meyerhoff et al., 2012, Schultz and Magor, 2008). The release of the chicken genome sequence (International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004) revolutionised our understanding of the repertoire and biology of immune-related molecules, including cytokines and chemokines, resulting in a large and expanding chicken immunological \u201ctoolbox\u201d of reagents (Kaiser et al., 2005, Kaiser, 2007, Kaiser, 2010, Kaiser and St\u00e4heli, 2008). The availability of genome sequences for other avian species, including the zebrafinch (Warren et al., 2010), the turkey (Dalloul et al., 2010) and the duck (http://pre.ensembl.org/Anas_platyrhyncos/Info/), should allow identification and subsequent characterisation of their immune gene repertoires.",

However, only five cytokines have been biologically characterised in the turkey: type I IFN (Suresh et al., 1995), IFN-\u03b3 (Lawson et al., 2001, Loa et al., 2001), IL-1\u03b2 (Wu et al., 2007), IL-2 (Lawson et al., 2000), and IL-18 (Kaiser, 2002), and a single chemokine, IL-8 (also known as CXCLi2) (Wu et al., 2008). A partial sequence for turkey IL-12\u03b2 had also been identified pre-genome (Balu and Kaiser, 2003). All of these share high nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identities with their chicken orthologues. Only three (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and CXCLi2) have been tested for cross-reactivity. All three cytokines cross-reacted, somewhat surprisingly in the case of IL-2 as chicken and turkey IL-2 share only 69.9% aa identity (Lawson et al., 2000, Lawson et al., 2001, Wu et al., 2008). This leads to the hypothesis that other chicken and turkey cytokines would also show cross-reactivity. In addition, Powell et al. (2009a) identified and cloned three turkey T cell surface markers and demonstrated cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies recognising chicken CD8\u03b1 and CD28 with the respective turkey orthologues.",

Chicken IL-10 inhibits IFN-\u03b3 production from mitogen-activated splenocytes, and increased expression of IL-10 has been linked with susceptibility to infection with the intracellular protozoan parasite, Eimeria maxima (Rothwell et al., 2004). IL-10 expression is also significantly increased (along with IL-4 and IL-13) in chickens during the lytic phase of infection with Marek's disease virus (Heidari et al., 2008), indicating that IL-10 plays a role in the immuno-regulation of Th1 responses in the chicken.",

These effects are mediated through a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of inflammatory cytokine responses and promoting IgE class-switching (reviewed by Wynn, 2003). It was cloned in the chicken through genomic analysis based on the conservation of synteny with the rest of the Th2 cytokine gene cluster (Avery et al., 2004). We and others have shown that during infection with extracellular pathogens, chicken IL-13 is induced to far greater levels than chicken IL-4 (Degen et al., 2005, Powell et al., 2009b, Schwarz et al., 2011), the canonical Th2 cytokine in man and mouse. Given that chickens and turkeys are closely related in evolutionary terms (Dalloul et al., 2010), it seems likely that IL-10 and IL-13, as well as other immune-related molecules, will have similar roles in the two species.",

The coding sequence of 420 nt from start to stop codon was identified (Fig. 4\n), which included the insertion of an additional serine residue, at position 27 (CCA at 80\u201382 bp), compared to the chicken sequence. Sequence identity between turkey IL-13 and human IL-13 is 49.6% and 15.0% at the nt and aa levels, respectively, with similar levels of identity between turkey and murine IL-13. Mammalian and avian IL-13 each has five cysteine residues, four of which are conserved in location. Identity between chicken and turkey IL-13 is high, with 90.0% and 79.9% identity at the nt and aa levels, respectively. Amino acid changes show evidence of some clustering, with seven aa changes from positions 24 to 31, which is the region directly following the predicted cleavage site for processing of the signal peptide of mammalian IL-13. Five aa changes occur between positions 39 and 47 which lie within helix A of human IL-13 and four changes between positions 80 and 84, three of which lie within helix B of human IL-13. Five aa changes between positions 102 and 107 lie between helix C and the second \u03b2-sheet (Avery et al., 2004). Since the exon boundaries are consistent between species (http://www.ensembl.org/Meleagris_gallopavo/), this shows that a high proportion of replacements occurs in exons 1, 3 and 4. All of the cysteine residues in IL-13 are conserved between the chicken and turkey. With the relatively high level of aa identity and the conservation of cysteine residues, we could speculate that the biological activities exhibited by chicken IL-13 are conserved between the two avian species, and that turkey and chicken IL-13 will cross-react. The sequence was submitted to Ensembl with the Acc. No. AM493431.",

IL-13 mRNA was also expressed in all digestive tract tissues to similarly low levels and to varying extents in the non-lymphoid tissues.

In addition to the immune response of turkeys to foot pad dermatitis (Mayne et al., 2007) and histomonosis (Powell et al., 2009b), it would be interesting to investigate the immune response to other commercially important turkey pathogens, including turkey rhinotracheitis, an avian pneumovirus which causes up to 30% mortality (10\u2013100% morbidity), avian flu, coccidia and bacteria (including Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli).
