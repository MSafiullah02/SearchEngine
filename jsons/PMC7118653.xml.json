Given the rapidity with which SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, we can expect an increased burden of patients with cancer who have received a diagnosis of COVID-19 at oncology treatment clinics and a need to address this diagnosis. As of the date of this writing, the United States has witnessed an increase in confirmed cases, not far behind the large outbreaks of European countries.2\n,\n3\n",

In one of the largest series reported from Wuhan, elderly patients were at a higher risk for disease severity, with an 8.0% case fatality rate in those aged 70 to 79 years and 14.8% in those aged 80 years and older.4 The case fatality rate for patients with cancer in that cohort was notably higher than that among patients without cancer, at 5.6% versus 2.1% in the whole sample; however, it must be noted that this series is very small. How these numbers will evolve in the US population remains to be determined. Based on available data, the impact of patients both at risk for and positive for COVID-19 will be felt throughout oncology clinics. The burden this may place on radiation oncology clinics is of particular concern owing to the potential need for screening of patients for daily treatment, treatment interruptions, delays in restarting treatment, and a decreased workforce.",

However, when dealing with a new pathogen for which limited information exists, predicting the efficacy of these measures is difficult. It is therefore imperative that patients with cancer be prevented from congregating in areas with potential SARS-CoV-2 carriers, which means controlling exposures in waiting rooms and treatment areas. Guidelines for prevention of other respiratory viral spread in the health care setting for patients with cancer should be followed,6\n,\n8 in addition to the continually updated recommendations from the CDC and World Health Organization.7\n,\n9 This includes screening of patients for symptoms upon entering a clinic and immediate isolation and contact precautions for patients suspected to be infected.10\n,\n11 Some clinics may opt to screen all patients upon immediate entry into the facility, or even before entering, to decrease exposure risks. For COVID-19, suspicion for infection would be high in patients with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and/or a history of recent travel to high-risk areas.7 It should be mentioned that guidelines and recommendations are likely subject to change over time as infectious disease and epidemiology experts learn more.

Patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus will, at a minimum, require a 14-day quarantine per CDC recommendations.16 At the other end of the spectrum, patients with cancer with immunosuppression may require hospitalization and isolation precautions, thus preventing the continuation of radiation treatments. Data from a report of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 showed that 6.1% of patients required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or died.17 Although it is yet unclear how the virus will behave in the United States, the situations in China and Italy suggest the burden on hospitals and intensive care units will be significant. Additionally, this study demonstrated that pneumonia and lymphocytopenia were prominent at 91.1% and 83.2%, respectively, which would affect decisions to delay treatments pending improvements in the patient\u2019s clinical status and immune recovery.17 These treatment interruptions would be of utmost concern in tumors for which treatment package time significantly affects outcomes, such as head and neck and cervical tumors.18\n,\n19 This is also of concern in lung tumors and other thoracic tumors, both for tumor control and the lungs potentially lying in the path of treatment beams. Treatments would likely need to be paused while monitoring the course of COVID-19 in this setting. Treatment delays may also be due to strains on the health care system in the setting of a pandemic due to travel restrictions, availability of workforce, and/or lack of access to hospital care.20 If possible, travel restrictions for the general public should be tailored for patients with cancer, such as what is being done currently in Italy.21\n",

However, we may borrow insight from the response of radiation oncology clinics during Hurricane Maria. As per Gay et al,22 mitigating the impact of a natural disaster on patients with cancer requires 4 components, or \u201cPCOC\u201d: prepare, communicate, operate, compensate. In preparing, consideration should be made for scenarios that may require delayed treatment starts or shorter fractionation regimens (ie, hypofractionation), given that COVID-19 poses a substantial immediate risk for elderly patients. Again, there is a paucity of data to guide these decisions, and priority should be given to higher risk tumors (eg, head and neck, cervix, lung), which are nicely referenced in the Hurricane Maria review. Overall, the immediate risk of COVID-19 will have to be weighed against the long-term risks associated with the specific cancer diagnosis.",

For radiation oncology clinics, this may also require rescheduling of nonessential follow-up visits or diverting these visits to telemedicine if available.13 Because a large proportion of our patients are elderly, discretion is needed to protect this vulnerable group from exposure. Visits past the 5-year mark for patients with no evidence of disease or concerning symptoms should be considered for rescheduling if all clinical, laboratory, and imaging data suggest low risk for recurrence. This would ideally be at the discretion of the treating physician with appropriate clinically specific concern. However, in the context of elevated community-spread risk of a new pathogen with a considerable fatality rate among the elderly, it seems prudent to re-evaluate the timing of follow-up visits for patients who are clinical without evidence of disease with long disease-free intervals.",

In the Wuhan outbreak, as reported by Wu and McGoogan,4 63% of health care workers became infected, and 14.8% of cases in health care personnel were severe or critical. Although it is too early to predict how this will affect the US workforce, the number is suggestive of a great potential for a shortage of providers. Additionally, some clinicians will remain home to serve as caregivers for others who are ill. Just as patients are at risk for possible quarantine or hospitalization, so are health care workers, and we will need to adapt accordingly. This may mean other measures in addition to the strict travel restrictions being implemented by many institutions, such as identification of back-up staff or consideration for staff teams who can rotate to retain a team at all times.12 Furthermore, thought may be put into essential and nonessential staff as the outbreak grows, as was done during the SARS experience in Canada.25 Consideration of remote work for nonessential members should be reviewed. As an example, some institutions may ask some members of the dosimetry and/or physics teams to work remotely to decrease unnecessary risk of viral transmission. This should also include a strict policy on remaining home when ill or potentially ill to avoid unnecessary exposures to both patients and staff. Data from Wuhan are unavailable regarding oncology staff management during the outbreak. The situation in Italy is evolving rapidly but may serve as a useful model in the coming weeks.",
