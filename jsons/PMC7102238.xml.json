The gene product encoding GrB is \u223c3500 bp long, contains five exons and four introns, and maps to chromosome 14 on the human genome.6 Similar to caspases, GrB has a preference for cleaving peptides immediately adjacent to aspartate (Asp) residues.7, 8 This specificity is due to the structure of the GrB active site, which contains an arginine (Arg) residue positioned at the side of the active site pocket.9 An interaction between an Asp residue at the P1 position of the substrate and the Arg residue within the active site is key for enzyme\u2013substrate interaction.9",

In T lymphocytes and NK cells, many of the extracellular factors that stimulate T cell activation will also augment GrB expression, including the composition of the cytokine milieu, the nature of receptor engagement, and the presence of helper or regulatory CD4+ T cell populations.21",

The only known endogenous inhibitor of GrB in humans is protease inhibitor-9 (PI-9), which is a potent inhibitor of GrB and is expressed by immune cells as protection against accidental cytosolic GrB leakage.30, 31 Endothelial cells, vascular SMCs, and hepatocytes have also shown an ability to express PI-9 as a means of protection from GrB-mediated cytotoxicity.32, 33, 34, 35 High levels of PI-9 expression can be found in DCs, T cells, and endothelial cells of lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissue, as well as in cells of immune-privileged tissues, including the eyes, testes, ovaries, and placenta.36 In mice, serine protease inhibitor 6 shares homology with human PI-9, in which it functions to regulate GrB activity.37 Recently, Sipione et al38 discovered an inhibitor of mouse and human GrB, serpina3n, expressed by mouse Sertoli cells. Serpina3n shares homology with the human \u03b1-1-antichymotrypsin, which interestingly does not appear to show any inhibitory effect on GrB in humans. GrB activity may also be indirectly influenced by the actions of granzyme H (GrH) and granzyme M (GrM). GrM may inhibit the action of human PI-9, thereby promoting GrB activity,39 whereas GrH has the ability to cleave the adenoviral protein Ad5-100K in an effort to counter viral defense against GrB.40",

However, as discussed below, recent reports suggest that there may also be perforin- and/or apoptosis-independent roles for GrB in disease progression. Apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) modification are hallmarks of many, if not most, chronic inflammatory disorders and the involvement of GrB in a number of inflammatory diseases is becoming evident and will be the focus of this review.",

The key effectors of the granule pathway are the granzymes. Granzymes are expressed with a signal sequence that directs them to the endoplasmic reticulum. Cleavage of this signal peptide produces an inactive pro-enzyme that contains an N-terminal dipeptide and requires cleavage to produce an active protease.48, 49 In the golgi, granzymes are tagged with a mannose 6-phosphate used to target the granzymes to the lytic granule.29 Once inside the granule, granzymes are activated by removal of the N-terminal dipeptide by cathepsin C and stored on a scaffold of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, serglycin.48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 Storage on this scaffolding, in combination with the acidic pH of the lytic granules, acts to minimize the proteolytic activity of granzymes55 (reviewed in Chowdhury and Lieberman21).",

            "text": "Delivery of granzymes into the cytoplasm of target cells induces cell death. The major lytic proteins packaged within the granules are granzymes and the pore-forming protein perforin. Traditional models indicate that GrB delivery into a target cell is mediated by perforin; however, the mechanism by which this is accomplished remains an active area of investigation. Perforin is a Ca2+-dependent pore-forming protein that multimerizes in the target cell's plasma membrane, forming 5\u201320 nm pores.61, 62 Early models suggested that perforin facilitates the movement of granzymes into the cytoplasm of the target cell through the formation of pores; however, this model was challenged when it was discovered that granzymes could be endocytosed without perforin.63, 64, 65, 66 More recent models show that GrB binds to the MPR and is rapidly endocytosed by the target cell.67 This process is likely dynamin-dependent and results in the formation of endosomes containing GrB and perforin; however, a dynamin-independent role has been proposed.67, 68, 69, 70, 71 GrB is then released from the endosomes into the cytosol, using a perforin-dependent mechanism where it can target cellular substrates and initiate cell death.69, 72, 73 However, although increasing evidence supports a role for MPR in GrB uptake, controversy does exist with regard to the dynamin/MPR mechanism as some evidence suggests this may not be required for GrB entry. It should also be noted that transfer of GrB to the endosome can occur in a perforin-independent manner.69, 71, 72, 74 Although a role beyond facilitating granzyme entry into cells is not known, perforin is required for CL-driven GrB-mediated apoptosis, as perforin deficiencies are associated with impaired lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. Perforin-deficient mice are highly susceptible to viral infection75, 76 and cancer.77, 78 In humans, perforin deficiencies are associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis, an autosomal-recessive disorder resulting in uncontrolled T and NK cell activation and proliferation.79, 80, 81",

GrB entry may also be facilitated by other cell-surface-bound proteins, such as heat shock protein-70 (Hsp-70).83 Hsp-70 present on the surface of tumor cells not only facilitates the movement of GrB into the tumor cell but also stimulates the production and delivery of GrB by NK cells.84",

However, as several GrB-expressing cells may not co-express perforin and/or form IS with target cells, it is likely that these cells would exert more of an extracellular impact on disease.

For example, GrB is capable of producing autoantigens from the non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. Sera from SLE patients contained antibodies against XRCC4, and three of these patients recognized the specific GrB cleavage epitope, suggesting GrB may produce these fragments in vivo.207 However, in a mouse model of autoimmunity in which GrB-deficient mice were injected with the mineral oil pristane, GrB knockout mice still produced autoantibodies and had a higher mortality than mice expressing GrB, suggesting that GrB may not be a critical enzyme in autoantigen synthesis. However, the latter study would not rule out the possibility that the other granzymes may be contributing to autoantigen formation in this model. In addition, the authors suggest that GrB may be protective because of its role in viral clearance, as viral infection is believed to promote autoimmunity.208, 267",

This lung-specific conformation exposes a cryptic GrB cleavage site, resulting in HisRS fragmentation and GrB-dependent synthesis of an autoantigenic peptide, specific to the lung.223 It is interesting to speculate that GrB-specific autoantigens are cleaved when protein conformation is altered, thereby uncovering otherwise hidden GrB cleavage sites. Protein conformational changes due to post-translational modifications, pH changes, mechanical damage, dissociation from binding partners, changes in subcellular localization, and other factors may have a role in the susceptibility to GrB cleavage of not just autoantigens but also to intracellular and extracellular substrates involved in a vast array of activities, having endless potential implications in signaling, apoptosis, and extracellular activities in vivo.",

In similar studies, Bauer et al described GrB-positive lymphocytes in close proximity to astrocytes on the border of astrocyte-deficient lesions.

Extracellular GrB is capable of cleaving the neuronal glutamate receptor subunit 3 (GLUR3) and producing an autoantigenic fragment. Antibodies against GLUR3 are present in the serum of children with this disease. However, GrB can only cleave the non-glycosylated form of the receptor, suggesting that normal tolerance is escaped when neurons produce the unglycosylated form of the protein. The change in glycosylation of this protein makes it more susceptible to GrB cleavage, possibly by exposing a cryptic cleavage site not present in the glycosylated form of the receptor.131 This suggests that GrB cleavage of ECM and receptors may also be regulated by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, an area that has been scarcely described and may be significant in disease pathogenesis in general.",

There was no correlation between the CSF cell count and levels, suggesting that this is not due to an increase in cell number and that there is localized GrB release in the CSF/central nervous system of MS patients.123 As there are low numbers of NK cells in the CSF of MS patients, it is believed that the cellular source of GrB is CTLs.

Substance P also resulted in regression of hair follicles out of the growth phase into catagen, suggesting this could be related to a substance P-dependent increase in CD8+ GrB-expressing cells.159 Although more studies are required to determine causation and to define the mechanism by which GrB contributes to AA, there is an association between the disease and GrB expression.",

Indeed, elevated levels of GrB are detected in the plasma of patients with atherosclerosis, with the highest levels detected in patients with unstable plaques, lending support to the hypothesis that GrB influences plaque instability. In a study by Skjelland et al,232 increased GrB levels in the plasma corresponded to carotid plaque instability and increased incidence of cerebrovascular events in humans. Elevated GrB production was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with unstable angina pectoris compared with cells from patients with stable angina pectoris.233 Thus, evidence to date indicates that GrB might be involved in the initiation of plaque instability and rupture. In addition, the repercussions of elevated GrB levels may extend beyond plaque rupture and into post-infarct ventricular remodeling as Kondo et al recently reported elevated GrB levels in the plasma of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in both the acute and subacute phases. They also found that sustained levels of GrB was an independent factor for late-stage left ventricular remodeling.234",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which GrB may contribute to plaque stability include ECM fragmentation, release of ECM-sequestered cytokines, and/or induction of macrophage or SMC apoptosis in the fibrous cap. To the latter point, Choy et al135 showed, using a cell culture model, that GrB could induce SMC apoptosis in the absence of perforin through the disruption of SMC\u2013ECM interactions and induction of anoikis. Conversely, levels of the endogenous GrB inhibitor PI-9 in SMC markedly reduced in unstable plaques versus stable plaques, implying a role for GrB-induced SMC apoptosis. It should be noted, however, that although the GrB-inhibitory role of PI-9 is well-established, its effects on GrB as a potential mechanism were not considered nor discussed in the latter study. Rather, reduced PI-9 was associated with increased SMC caspase-1 activity and IL-1\u03b2 production.35 With regard to its extracellular function in atherosclerosis, GrB is capable of cleaving multiple ECM proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin.134, 135 These data suggest that GrB may contribute to plaque instability through both intracellular and extracellular activities, leading to the formation of a necrotic core and thinning of the fibrous cap, and ultimately plaque rupture.10 Although ongoing, preliminary studies have been reported using apolipoprotein E \u00d7 GrB double knockout mice in which GrB deficiency was found to be associated with reduced atherosclerosis, suggesting that this protease may be important in this disease.305",

GrB can also bypass the mitochondrial pathway and initiate caspase activation directly and/or cleave caspase substrates such as the inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (ICAD), thereby allowing CAD to translocate to the nucleus to fragment DNA.

During a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, GrB accumulates extracellularly in the tissues, blood stream, and other bodily fluids. GrB retains its activity in the blood, suggesting that, unlike MMPs and cathepsins, extracellular inhibitors of GrB activity may be limited. GrB can cleave proteins involved in structural integrity and wound healing such as fibronectin. GrB can also cleave proteins related to clotting (fibrinogen, vWF, plasminogen). GrB can induce detachment-mediated cell death (anoikis) through the cleavage of ECM. Although yet to be shown for granzymes, MMP-mediated fragments of fibronectin and elastin show chemotactic properties and may enhance the immune response in atherosclerosis. Fragments may also exhibit bioactive properties and may be able to release cytokines from the matrix.

(a) Infiltrating immune cells in RA (CTLs, macrophages, NK cells, and T-helper cells) express and release GrB in joints and induce apoptosis in resident cells (1). GrB may contribute to proteoglycan degradation as GrB-positive cells are found at the pannus\u2013cartilage junction, an area of cartilage destruction (2). Extracelllular GrB levels are elevated in the synovial fluid of RA joints and are believed to further degrade matrix (3). Chondrocytes express GrB in RA and are capable of inducing apoptosis in neighboring cells and secreting GrB into the extracellular milieu, which causes further extracellular damage (4). (b) GrB may contribute to skin aging, alopecia, and disease through various intracellular and extracellular pathways. UVA light, which is believed to be responsible for visible aging that occurs in the skin, induces reactive oxygen species production, which leads to GrB expression in keratinocytes (1). GrB from keratinocytes cleaves the ECM protein fibronectin (2), inhibits cell migration, and can also induce apoptosis in neighboring cells (3). Mast cells from the skin are another cell type that express GrB (4). GrB from CTLs has been proposed to induce melanocyte apoptosis in vitiligo (5). Invading CTLs express GrB in alopecia areata and influence hair follicle regression (6). Substance P secreted by skin mast cells increases GrB-positive CTLs in the skin, further promoting AA (7). Whether substance P induces mast cell degranulation leading to the release of GrB is unknown. (c) At the early stages of atherosclerosis, after endothelial dysfunction and intimal lipid retention, CTLs, and monocytes infiltrate the vessel wall and migrate into the intima. SMCs and macrophages engulf oxidized lipoproteins and become lipid-laden foam cells, leading to GrB expression in these cells. The latter may promote foam cell apoptosis in developing plaques. GrB can also cleave various extracellular matrix proteins that maintain fibrotic cap stability. In addition to a loss in matrix integrity, ECM cleavage will also result in a loss of SMC\u2013ECM interactions, which may promote apoptosis. SMC expression of PI-9 is decreased in unstable plaques, rendering SMCs susceptible to GrB-dependent apoptosis and further promoting plaque instability and rupture.",
