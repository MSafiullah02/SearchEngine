A birth cohort, enrolled between August and December of both 2012 and 2013, were followed by a combination of passive and active surveillance for development of RSV infection during the subsequent winter. Infants with respiratory symptoms were evaluated at home for RSV infection using an RSV group\u2013specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay [19]. A second cohort was enrolled when seen for acute respiratory symptoms in pediatric offices or emergency rooms and tested for RSV by antigen detection (Quidel, San Diego, CA) and/or RT-PCR. The third cohort consisted of infants hospitalized with RSV at URMC\u2019s Golisano Children\u2019s Hospital. Eligible subjects were full-term (>36 wk gestation) healthy infants born after the previous May 1 and aged <10 months at RSV infection to ensure primary infection. The hospitalized infants were seen daily until discharged, and charts were reviewed for signs of respiratory illness and lowest room air oxygen saturation (SaO2).",

Interleukin 9 (IL-9) pathway signaling was also predicted to be altered, but it was unclear whether this pathway was activated or inhibited. Identification of these pathways was predominantly driven by genes demonstrating significant increases in expression, including IRS1, CISH, and SOCS2, among others in severe subjects. Next, we performed a survey for upstream regulatory molecules capable of explaining global changes in gene expression associated with disease severity (Supplementary Figure 2). Interestingly, prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES)\u2013 and cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2)\u2013mediated regulation was associated with CD4+ T-cell gene expression in severely ill infants, implicating shifts in arachidonate metabolism. Activation of NRF2 (NFE2L2), the major antioxidant pathway, was also associated with CD4+ T-cell gene expression in severely ill infants. This analysis also suggested activation of a number of regulators of mitogenesis, including MYC, KRAS, KIP1 (CDKN1B), and p53 (TP53).",

In fact, some observed gene expression changes specifically implicated responses associated with CD4 T-cell subtype, such as regulation of IL-9 signaling (Figure 2B). Also noted were increased activation of JAK2 and increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes in CD4 T cells from severe subjects, particularly SOCS2, which antagonizes the other SOCS proteins, and together with JAK2 regulates early Th1/Th2 differentiation [24\u201326]. In an effort to directly test whether severity-associated changes in gene expression were consistent with alterations in T-cell subtype, we implemented Bayesian estimation of transcription factor activity to predict transcription factor activity based upon CD4 gene expression patterns associated with severity [23]. We found changes in GATA3 activity were predicted to be significantly associated with severity as defined by the univariate model (P = 1.62E-05), whereas RORA was marginally significant (P = .04) and STAT1/2/4 and SMADs were not significant (P > .05). GATA3 is a transcriptional activator that is required for T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation. It also plays a role in differentiation of Th9 cells. These data support the interpretation that changes in CD4 T-cell subtype differentiation are associated with severity in RSV infection.",

Another study found that Treg cells express prolactin receptor and exposure to prolactin inhibited their suppressive effect on Th1 cells in vitro [28].

Confirming that such an effect is detectable in circulating, purified CD4 T cells is novel. It is known that the RSV NS1 and NS2 proteins block type I effectively via degradation of the transcription activator STAT2 [30]. The SOCS genes are included in the JAK/STAT pathways, and the SOCS2, SOCS3, and SOCS5 genes were all overexpressed in the severely ill subjects. It has been reported that SOCS3 is expressed during Th2 immune responses and in vitro experiments after exposure of murine respiratory epithelial cells to RSV [31]. Both STATs and SOCS are key regulators of T-cell differentiation, maturation, and function [32]. Similar to STATs, SOCS may cross-regulate one another, and the proteins are differentially expressed in Th cell lineage [33]. SOCS1 and SOCS3 favor Th2 and Th17 differentiation, and SOCS2 favors the differentiation of Th17 by the compensation of Th2 differentiation [34\u201336]. It also was not surprising to find that the PI3K/AKT pathway activation was increased in severe RSV disease. PI3K signaling is thought to have an important role in CD4 T-cell differentiation and function, including Tregs [37]. Respiratory syncytial virus has been shown to rapidly activate this pathway, which is associated with inhibition of cellular apoptosis as well as increased inflammatory cytokine production [38].",

In a murine model of RSV infection, depletion of IL-9 enhanced clearance of virus from the lungs, and the authors concluded that IL-9 promoted a Th2-type inflammatory response [41]. Together, our data are supportive of a model where shifts in CD4 T-cell subtype toward a Th2 phenotype are associated with severity of illness in RSV-infected infants. Further studies, particularly in larger and more heterogeneous populations, will be required to confirm this observation and to determine whether these changes are mechanistic or are purely a result of the illness itself.",

Although we did not use a formal severity scoring system to define disease severity in our population, we believe that the clinical criteria selected provided a valid separation of mild and severe disease. The use of sorted CD4 T cells, rather than whole blood, and RNA-seq are unique aspects of this study and add to the existing gene expression literature. A potential limitation of this method is that some of the findings might have been affected by manipulation of the CD4 T cells during purification and sorting. However, and critically, identical procedures were used for processing samples from all subjects, regardless of disease severity. All blood samples were collected between 8 and 10 am, kept at room temperature, and processed immediately. Therefore, any impact of sample processing should be applicable to all subjects and result mostly in limitations of sensitivity.",
