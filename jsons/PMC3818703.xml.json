In addition to being difficult to resolve in crystallographic structures, they are likely to be intrinsically disordered (Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008, Liljas, 2011). Intrinsically disordered sequences are typically characterized by a high proportion of polar and charged residues and underrepresentation of bulky hydrophobic residues. Furthermore, intrinsically disordered regions have high specificity but lower affinity in their interaction with ligands, a feature useful for multifunctional proteins (Dunker et al., 2008). Importantly, proteins with intrinsically disordered regions include ones that act as hubs to mediate a network of protein\u2013protein interactions (Dunker et al., 2005). This feature likely applies to viral CPs.",

With the nonenveloped viruses, the NTA may function in virion trafficking in the cell and/or RNA release. The NTAs of Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV: Bromoviridae) and Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV; Tombusviridae) are highly sensitive to proteases, suggesting that they can extend outside of the virion (Kakani et al., 2004, Speir et al., 2006). Intriguingly, the NTA of the CNV CP facilitates interaction with cellular filaments to mediate virion trafficking to plastids (Xiang et al., 2006). These reports suggest that flexibility of the CP arms to shuttle from the interior to the exterior of the capsid are involved in the virion's translocation.",

Following addition of other dimers, the dimers of CPs may associate into higher-order intermediates, such as pentamers of dimers or trimers of dimers, which ultimately leads to the formation of capsid (Prasad et al., 1999, Rossmann et al., 1985, Sorger et al., 1986). Structures of a number of spherical (+)-strand RNA viruses have revealed the association of the RNA density with dimers, pentamers or hexamers of the CPs (Bottcher and Crowther, 1996, Chen et al., 1989, Fisher and Johnson, 1993), indicating that the RNA-CP interface may change with the oligomerization state of the CP. This, in turn, could influence the conformation and function of the RNA. The status of CP oligomerization also dictates its protein\u2013protein interaction interface, as has been demonstrated for capsid assembly (Stockley et al., 2007). Although atomic structures of many capsids are well-characterized, the dynamic interaction between CP subunits or between CP and RNA is more difficult to capture. Nonetheless, it is likely that the oligomerization state of CPs significantly impact their regulatory activities.",

The structure of the CP-RNA complex exhibits sequence-specific recognition (Valeg\u00e5rd et al., 1994). Interestingly, the motif regulated by the MS2 CP also functions as an encapsidation signal during virus assembly (Beckett and Uhlenbeck, 1988). Several CP mutants defective for virion assembly suppressed the RdRp translation better than did the wild type, presumably through elevated concentrations of the CP dimers (Peabody and Ely, 1992).

The AMV CP was found to interact with the host translation initiation factors eIF4G and eIFiso4G that bind the 5\u2032 cap structure of mRNA (Krab et al., 2005). Since the AMV CP also binds to the 3\u2032 UTR of the viral RNAs, interaction with the translation factors that bind to the 5\u2032 UTR will functionally circularize the capped viral RNAs. This could facilitate ribosome reloading in translation. Furthermore, the AMV CP is effectively mimicking the function of host PolyA-binding protein (PABP) (Neeleman et al., 2001). The CP of Rubella virus (Togaviridae) specifically binds and sequesters the host PABP (Ilkow et al., 2008). Sequestration of PABP suppresses both the translation of host mRNAs and the viral RNAs that contain 3\u2032 polyA tails. Impairing viral RNA translation may promote the encapsidation of viral RNAs while suppressing translation of host mRNAs perhaps reduce host immune responses to viral infection (see sections below).",

            "text": "In addition to the effects on translation, binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of viral RNAs by the AMV CP can regulate RNA synthesis. One model suggests that the interaction stimulates RNA synthesis by reorganizing the conformation of 3\u2032 UTR to facilitate the recognition of the promoter for minus-strand synthesis by the viral RdRp (Guogas et al., 2004, Reichert et al., 2007). An alternative model proposes that the change in 3\u2032 UTR conformation upon CP binding blocks RNA synthesis (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010, Olsthoorn et al., 1999). A key to reconciling these discrepant observations may be that the CP strongly stimulated viral RNA replication at low concentrations, but inhibits replication at higher concentrations (Guogas et al., 2005). The stepwise binding of CP to multiple elements in the 3\u2032 UTR of the AMV RNA may switch AMV RNAs from translation to replication to virion assembly (Petrillo et al., 2005, Reusken et al., 1994). The BMV CP has also been implicated in viral RNA replication through its recognition of the promoter for BMV minus-strand RNA synthesis when present in low amounts (Yi et al., 2009, Zhu et al., 2007). A single nucleotide change to the promoter that dramatically reduces BMV RNA replication (Sivakumaran et al., 1999; Kim and Kao, 2001) also decreases binding by the CP (Zhu et al., 2007).",

Introduction of the CP gene into the deleted region of the P150 gene yielded a viable subgenomic replicon that accumulated with wild-type kinetics (Tzeng and Frey, 2009). A cluster of positively-charged residues close to the RNA-binding region in the NTA of the CP was necessary for the complementation. This finding is unique in that the CP shares a common function with part of the replication protein, likely RNA binding, for viral RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the Rubella virus CP enhanced the replication of subgenomic replicons at low CP levels, but inhibited replication at high CP levels (Chen and Icenogle, 2004, Tzeng and Frey, 2005).

A single amino acid mutation in the P domain of capsid protein VP1 of Murine norovirus (MNV: Caliciviridae) attenuated pathogenicity in mice as well as decreased MNV replication (Bailey et al., 2008, Strong et al., 2012). A MNV replicon with a frameshift mutation that disrupted VP1 expression was defective for RNA replication, and expression of VP1 in trans rescued its replication (Subba-Reddy et al., 2012). Co-expression of the VP1 and RdRp of the genogroup II.4 human norovirus also significantly enhanced RNA synthesis by the viral RdRp (Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2011, Subba-Reddy et al., 2012). In this assay, the S domain of VP1 was necessary and sufficient to increase viral RNA synthesis.",

The most extensively characterized is TCV, where a dominant gene HRT (Hypersensitive Response to TCV) confers hypersensitive response (HR) in the inoculated leaves to limit TCV spread. A recessive gene, RRT (Regulator of Resistance to TCV), also contributes to resistance (Cooley et al., 2000, Kachroo et al., 2000). Overexpression of the CP in seedlings wild-type for HRT resulted in HR-induced necrosis (Cooley et al., 2000). A transcription factor TIP (TCV-interacting protein) in the NAC family of developmental regulators in Arabidopsis has been identified to bind to the arginine-rich NTA of the TCV CP in the yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro (Ren et al., 2000, Ren et al., 2005). The link between TIP and the R genes is unclear since insertion-inactivation of TIP did not affect the HR response to TCV infection, although an increase in CMV infection was observed (Jeong et al., 2008).",

It regulates the development of immune system cells as well as eliminates the infected cells (Roulston et al., 1999). There are two pathways to activate apoptosis (Elmore, 2007). The extrinsic pathway initiates with recognition of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by transmembrane receptors that leads to the activation of effector caspases. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by a diverse array of intracellular signals that act on sensors such as p53 and the signals are propagated to the mitochondria. A loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential activates caspases. Not surprisingly, some viruses can avoid the elicitation of apoptosis. However, others viruses can stimulate apoptosis as part of their pathogenesis or dissemination (Everett and McFadden, 1999). Therefore, controlling the apoptosis machinery is crucial to the viral infection cycle. Numerous viral factors, including the viral CP, modulate apoptosis (Galluzzi et al., 2008).",

Expression of WNV core protein suppresses apoptosis through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and its downstream target, Akt, a pro-survival kinase (Urbanowski and Hobman, 2013). In contrast, the precursor WNV core protein with the C-terminal signal peptide induced p53-mediated apoptosis (Yang et al., 2008). The precursor core protein promoted abnormal p53 accumulation by sequestering the HDM2 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation. An explanation for the opposing effects is that the release of core protein following virus entry inhibits apoptosis in early stages of infection and the accumulation of the precursor core protein triggers apoptosis later in the infection cycle (Lee et al., 2005).",

These processes are mediated by the viral movement proteins (MPs), but CPs of some viruses have also been demonstrated to play a role. Mutation of a single residue on the CP of Carnation ringspot virus (CRSV: Tombusviridae) abolished virus systemic infection without disrupting the encapsidation function of the CP (Sit et al., 2001). A similar effect was observed in the related Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (Tombusviridae) where virus with mutations of the CP could systemically infect N. benthamiana only at a low temperature (Xiong et al., 1993). Deletions in the CP of Cowpea chlorotic mosaic virus and Cucumber mosaic virus of the Bromoviridae prevented virion formation yet supported systemic or local spread of viral RNAs (Kaplan et al., 1998, Schmitz and Rao, 1998, Schneider et al., 1997).

The CPs of multiple (+)-strand RNA viruses can regulate viral genome translation and replication and host cell immune responses. In several cases, the CPs exert both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the same viral infection processes or host responses. This likely reflects that the CP oligomerization is a function of subunit concentration. The state of oligomerization could change the interaction interface of CPs and the kinetics of binding to RNAs or proteins. This could, in turn, influence interpretation of results from experiments, especially where the CP was expressed ectopically rather than in the context of virus infection.",

            "text": "Finally, it is important to note that the regulatory activities of the CPs of (+)-strand RNA viruses mirror those of nucleocapsid proteins of (-)-strand and dsRNA viruses (Tao and Ye, 2010). (-)-strand and dsRNA viruses replicate within virion core structures or require the presence of the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein has been shown to bridge the interaction between RNA template and viral replication proteins (Green and Luo, 2009), or allosterically regulate replication protein activities (Lawton et al., 1997, McClain et al., 2010, Newcomb et al., 2009). Therefore, some of the lessons already learned from viruses whose infection cycles are more intimately intertwined with the nucleocapsid proteins could be instructive to those who study (+)-strand RNA viruses. Furthermore, most depictions of RNA viruses inaccurately leave the capsid at the surface of the infected cell. This should be reconsidered, given that some of the CP likely interacts with the viral and host factors to contribute to the infection process.",
