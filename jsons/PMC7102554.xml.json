The origin of MERS virus is not fully understood, but according to the analysis of different virus genomes, it is believed that it has originated in bats and was transmitted to camels [2]. Most people infected with MERS have developed severe pneumonia, extra pulmonary organ dysfunction and ultimately death has ensued [3]. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and since then has spread in over approximately 27 countries. Out of the listed countries, the majority of cases (85%) have been reported from a single country Saudi Arabia [4]. To the date of the study, 1479 cases of MERS patient have been detected in Saudi Arabia, of which 854 (57.8%) have recovered, 617 (41.7%) have died and 8 (0.5%) are alive and undergoing treatment [5].",

More than half of all laboratory-confirmed cases have been associated with secondary cases, especially in healthcare settings [8] or transmission to close household contacts [6]. The transmission of the MERS virus to health care workers have been reported in different studies [9,10]. The majority of secondary cases reported in Saudi Arabia, were acquired through human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings [6]. Human-to-human transmission seems to be more probable in some cases of health care facilities, especially when infection prevention and control practices are insufficient. A study reported that infection control measures could keep the MERS virus at further restraining by taking appropriate actions otherwise disinclined to work lead to adverse effects on society and even numerous deaths [10]. Similarly, in another study, spread of MERS was reported due to lack of awareness, insufficient infection prevention and control in hospitals and overcrowding in emergency rooms [11].",

To measure the knowledge and practice of healthcare workers towards MERS, in which the options Yes or No against each set of questions were evaluated. To verify the attitude of healthcare workers, three options agree, disagree and neutral variables were used. To measure knowledge of workers, scores ranged from 0 to 13 and cut off level of \u22659 considered as good knowledge and <9 scores was set for poor knowledge. To evaluate the practice of workers towards MERS, a score of \u22676 was considered as a good practice while a score of <6 as a poor practice. A sample of 420 self-administered questionnaire were distributed randomly among healthcare workers.

The Current study results strongly support the similar findings in which the main source of MERS was reported as the internet and social media [13,14]. This clearly indicates that health care workers are relying on the internet, social media and online information as the easiest ways to get the information compared with books, articles, and other resources. The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have provided cluster with MERS information through their websites and are recommending everyone to be aware of updates knowledge about MERS [4,5]. However, in terms of seminars, a previous study reported only 1% as a source of information when compared with the current study [14]. Such a big difference possibly explained by the fact that the MOH in Saudi Arabia has planned and conducted serieses of workshops and seminars in the hospitals and health care settings to avail with the most up-to-date information of MERS among different health care workers to update their knowledge, skills and understanding of viral infection. The least source of MERS reported in the current study was a layperson. Depending on a person without professional or specialized knowledge in MERS could lead to an adverse effect on the impact of healthcare in treating MERS cases which is strongly recommended for health care professionals not to rely on lay people as a source of information.",

Interestingly, physicians showed higher knowledge levels of MERS when comparing with other workers such as technicians, pharmacist and nurses. Good knowledge level was clearly shown in response to the questions \u201cMERS patients develop severe acute respiratory illness\u201d (93.9%) and \u201cspecial caution required when a person presents with symptoms of MERS\u201d (93.3%). The outcomes of these questions are coincident with a similar study reported earlier [14]. All other answers to the remaining questions showed knowledge between 80 to 90% (Fig. 2). These results were of confidence that the healthcare workers are aware of MERS infection and its associated hygienic conditions. Possibly due to the Ministry of Health conducting successions of workshops and seminars resulting in levraging health care professionals knowledge. Furthermore, most health care workers are utilizing social media and browsing the internet for online information as observed in the current study (Fig. 1.) These results are stimulating that most health care professionals are utilizing social media and internet to understand the diagnosis of MERS easily that can help in preventing the spread of diseases. Interestingly, 92% of health care professionals participated in the current study were knowledgeable that meanwhile, there is no vaccine available in the market and the research are still ongoing in various countries in developing a vaccination against MERS. Which indicates that health care professionals must take at most precaution in treating and preventing the virus, as there is no vaccine. The health care workers were least knowledgeable regarding the questions; incubation time for the virus is 14\u201328 days (78.0%) and MERS-CoV caused by an alpha coronavirus (74.2%) respectively. These percentages of response are much lower when compared with a similar study [14] and higher with another study [13], the incubation period will be prolonged up to two weeks in humans [16]. Interestingly, mostly physicians and nurses wrongly answered when compared with technicians and pharmacist that the MERS caused by an alpha coronavirus. This demonstrates that there was a disparity in the level of knowledge among the health care workers. This level of knowledge is in contradiction with other studies towards Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [17]. In contrast, these results demonstrate that more priority towards these professions apart from the physician because they play key roles in improving health outcomes of MERS patient. This result also further encourages maintaining collaboration among health care professionals as teamworks in relation to clinical decision-making.",

These results are the resemblance to other studies where it has reported a positive attitude regarding the use of protective equipment when dealing with MERS patient [14] and further goggles and gloves should be worn when dealing with healthcare associated infections [13,18]. Similarly, all other questionnaires related to attitude showed good response among healthcare workers and that agreed ranges between 90 to 96%. These results in the present study acknowledge that healthcare workers are increasing acquaintance and awareness about disease and protect themselves during the outbreak of the disease. Similar results reported in dealing SARS infectious diseases [19]. The findings in the present study also illustrate that there is no negative attitude towards MERS among participants. On the contrary, to the results, there was a negative attitude reported in different studies in dealing with MERS and SARS infectious diseases [13, 14, 20 and 21]. However, when comparing different health care professionals, physicians and nurses showed a good attitude, whereas pharmacist and technicians showed the least attitude and do not show any statistical significant (p = 0.273) (Table 2). Different studies have shown a positive attitude of physicians when comparing different healthcare workers [14, 22, and 23].

This result is of a particular concern that though the workers have good knowledge and attitude, poor practice can lead to the spread of the infection in the community and further increasing mortality and morbidity. It was reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) helps prevent the spread of germs in the hospital and further protect people infections [25]. Therefore, it is important among different workers to adhere to the practice guidelines according to MOH and WHO intending the MERS infection in the community.

            "text": "Overall, among the studied different demographic characteristic features, age, gender and professions showed significantly associated with mean knowledge score (Table 4). However, the experience did not show any significant association with knowledge. In comparisons to similar concepts, two studies reported in which age, specialty and experience were significantly associated with a mean knowledge score [13] and another study showed association with gender and experience [14]. Additionally, statistical significance observed in gender and experience with mean attitude score in the current study. A previousstudy showed a significant association between genders with practice score, but no significance with knowledge and attitude score were observed [13]. Another study reported, gender and experience were associated with attitude scores which support the findings of the present study results [14]. This difference may be due to differences in the professional and academic training of physicians compared with other workers. Further, physicians remain abreast of current recommendations from MOH and WHO and ensure proper treatment and prevention of MERS infection when compared with all other workers as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and in Table 3. In terms of gender differences, it could be explained by Islamic traditional and cultural practices as males are more exposed to healthcare settings compared to females. Other studies have showen gender inequity in health education and public health sectors in Saudi Arabia can support the findings in the current study [26,27]. In contrast, the current study explores the positive correlation between knowledge and attitude of different health care professionals that is important in developing knowledge and understanding about MERS and leads to a positive attitude in treating MERS infection.",

Such outcome from the current study has important implications for future interventions such as to improve self-care, coordination of care with MERS patient and educating with infection prevention and control guidelines of MERS. The present study also was able to identify specific elements in knowledge, attitude and practice gaps to address during the implementation of future awareness programs and the major practice issues that need emphasis among all workers.
