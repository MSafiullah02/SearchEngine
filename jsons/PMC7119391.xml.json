Multiple etiologies have been linked to ND, including medication intolerance or abuse, antibiotic-associated disease, medical procedures, hyperalimentation, diarrhea associated with other medical conditions (diabetic neuropathy, uremia, etc), or acquisition of a nosocomial pathogen (1). The National Nosocomial Infections Study reported an overall rate of ND of 1.3/10,000 hospital discharges (2) from 1980 to 1984. In the 1990s, rates of ND in adults and elderly patients of 3.2\u201331.3 per 100 hospital admissions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 were reported.",

They estimated that this would decrease the number of stool exams by 30\u201350% without negatively affecting quality of care, and resulting in savings to the health care system of $20\u201330 million a year in 1990 dollars.

Fifty-three percent (567/1097) of adult stool cultures were ordered on patients hospitalized for longer than 3 days. None of those cultures were positive. They estimated that the cost per positive culture would drop from $1276 to $670 if cultures after the 3rd hospital day were rejected. In the second part of their trial, they instituted an intervention comprised of rejection of all stool cultures ordered past the 3rd hospital day, a circular to the medical staff justifying this rule, and the option for the clinician to contact the on-call fellow to override the rejection for clinical reasons. Their intervention resulted in a decrease of the percentage of stool cultures ordered past the 3rd hospital day from 53% to 30%. Three hundred sixty-eight cultures were rejected under the new rule. Clinical override was granted for 23 specimens, none of which turned out positive. They found stool leukocytes to be unhelpful as a screening test before culturing.",

The modified 3-day rule was then retrospectively tested at three other institutions using 14 yr worth of data amounting to 27,000 stool cultures. The modified rule would have missed two of 65 positive cultures obtained from patients after their 3rd hospital day; neither of them required antibiotic treatment. The unmodified 3-day rule would have missed 52 positive cultures, 28 of which required antibiotic treatment.

Laboratories that have not yet implemented strategies to limit wasteful stool cultures for ND can find in this modified rule a relatively safe and effective way to achieve better yields. Even in the absence of laboratory strategies, physicians can use this modified rule to increase their effectiveness in ordering stool cultures and shift their focus to other causes of ND in patients who do not fit these criteria. It is important to reiterate that, in contrast to stool cultures, tests for C. difficile toxin are positive in 20\u201325% of cases and should continue to be a routine component of the evaluation of ND.",
