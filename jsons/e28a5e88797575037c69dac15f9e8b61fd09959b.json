The classic example is smallpox, a disease which was eliminated by an international programme of vaccination using live vaccinia virus. (Vaccinia virus is a member of the Poxviridae and is immunologically related to smallpox virus.) Although for some people (such as immunosuppressed individuals) vaccination with vaccinia virus is not advisable, and although virus can be transferred from a vaccinee to others, the smallpox eradication programme was a milestone in human medicine that probably would not have been achieved as cheaply or as proficiently if a killed, or subunit, vaccine had been used. The eradication programme undoubtedly also owed its success to the fact that smallpox infection is limited to man. There is no other natural vertebrate or invertebrate reservoir of the virus. Other virus diseases exclusive to man (e.g. polio, measles and mumps) could, theoretically, also be eliminated with appropriate vaccination programmes . By contrast, it is unlikely that human viral diseases that also involve wildlife ",

The Baculoviridae are a family of lipidenveloped viruses with circular, double-stranded, DNA genomes of 80-150 kilobase-pairs, depending on the vir~&~. Unlike vaccinia virus, the virions neither possess nor require virus-encoded DNA-directed RNA polymerase activities. Naked viral DNA is infectious per se. Baculoviruses are restricted in their host ranges. They do not infect vertebrates, non-arthropod invertebrates, microorganisms, or plants. Indeed, baculoviruses infect only a few arthropod species. Many baculoviruses are pathogenic for these arthropods and a dozen or more are being used commercially as alternatives to chemical insecticides. Their use, which dates back to the 19th century and the induction of 'caterpillar wilP, has been successful and environmentally acceptable. But the commercial use of virus insecticides has been limited, Although specificity is an ecologically desirable feature, a single specific viral insecticide is insufficient to treat crops infected with several unrelated pests. Also, unlike chemicals, viruses may take several days or weeks to kill an insect pest. During that time the pest may cause an unacceptable level of damage to the crop. Chemical insecticides have a broader specificity and kill quickly. However, chemicals that affect beneficial insects as well as the pest species, or preparations that leave residues in the environment that affect other organisms (birds, fish, man), are also not desirable.",

The most frequently used system is one in which the foreign gene @laces the polyhedrin gene, allowing selection of non-occluded recombinants. Chimeric genes involving the foreign gene tagged on to part of the polyhedrin protein have also been described. Since in either case polyhedrin protein is not made, recombinants produce polyhedrin-negative plaques in tissue culture, in contrast to wild-type virus which produces plaques that contain cells with visible occlusion bodies. Alternative promoters have also been used, and selection systems similar to thoseusedtorecovervacciniarecombinants have been studied. In addition, duplicated promoters have been described, which allow both the native gene (e.g. the polyhedrin gene) and the foreign gene to be expressed\". The levels of expression of foreign genes can represent up to 50% of the total protein recovered from infected tissue culture cells, or from infected caterpillars. Virus insecticides are environmentally acceptable alternatives to chemical insecticides. By genetic engineering procedures it might be possible to improve the efficacy (e.g. speed of action) of such insecticides and induce other changes in phenotype.

As expected for an occluded virus, persistence was demonstrated throughout the six months of study both in soil and on foliage. In 1987, a second genetically manipulated virus insecticide was developed and tested in a field study. In this virus, the gene coding for the protective viral coat (the polyhedrin) was removed. The data from this study indicated that such a genetically crippled virus was still an effective pathogen. The study also demonstrated that the virus could not persist in the environment post infection, thus limiting its possible dispersal or interaction with other baculoviruses. Such a virus is planned to be a substrate for the next phase of the programme -the incorporation of genes designed to alter the virus phenotype.",

Such plants would probably be welcomed by farmers, because they would cut costs and reduce hazards to workers. From an environmental perspective, the small amount of biodegradable Sendotoxin would be a welcome replacement for insecticides that cause on-site and off-site pollution. While such an approach is certainly an improvement over the prophylactic use of synthetic pesticides, a closer look from an ecological and evolutionary perspective indicates that some changes in this approach could lead to long term benefits. The current approach for engineering B. t. 6-endotoxin genes into crops involves linking the DNA sequence that codes for the toxin with a constitutive promoter sequence. When such a construct is spliced into a plant's DNA, the toxin-encoding sequence should theoretically be expressed in all of the plant's tissues. In practice, there is usually some quantitative variation among tissues in expression of these genes. Nevertheless, the goal of producing a plant in which all structures are highly toxic to insects is in sight.",
