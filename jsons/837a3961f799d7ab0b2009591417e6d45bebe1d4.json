The clinical presentation of BRONJ is coupled with poor healing, spontaneous intraoral ulceration, and necrosis of the bone in the oral and maxillofacial regions (Sehbai et al, 2007) . BRONJ has been described in a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases including skeletal metastasis from solid tumors, multiple myeloma, and osteoporosis. It has been suggested that the risk of developing BRONJ is related to the duration and \u2044 or dosing frequency of BP treatment (Ruggiero et al, 2004; Durie et al, 2005; Cremers and Farooki, 2011) . Approximately 30% of patients with BRONJ are asymptomatic at clinical presentation, and the rest complain of severe local pain associated with soft-tissue swelling, loosening of teeth, and drainage. Other symptoms may include numbness, heaviness, and dysesthesia of the affected jaw (Vassiliou et al, 2010) .",

            "text": "The direct cause \u2044 effect relationship between BP treatment and BRONJ has yet to be elucidated although several possible mechanisms of BRONJ pathogenesis have been suggested including ischemia, reduced bone turnover, toxicity to bone, toxicity to soft tissue, microcracks, inflammation, and infection (Lesclous et al, 2009; Reid, 2009; Hoefert et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2010) . ONJ incidence correlation with BP potency suggests that inhibition of osteoclast function and differentiation might be a key factor in the pathophysiology of the disease. However, ONJ associated with patients receiving denosumab, a human RANKL monoclonal antibody (Aghaloo et al, 2010) , suggested another trigger for developing ONJ than BP therapy. The oral cavity is home to hundreds of microorganisms, and cases of bone necrosis secondary to BP therapy occur almost exclusively in the jaws where oral bacteria have access to bone (e.g., through saliva or odontogenic infection), especially after exposure of bone following a dental procedure such as an extraction. Compared with other parts of the body, bone can easily be colonized by the abundant flora of bacteria and yeast in the oral cavity that have the potential to cause biofilm-mediated disease (Sedghizadeh et al, 2008 (Sedghizadeh et al, , 2009 ). Hoefert and Eufinger (Hoefert and Eufinger, 2011) in their recent study indicated that long-term preoperative antibiotic treatment can lead to a complete healing in 70-87% of cases in contrast to 35-53% with a short-term regime. In addition, patients with cancer are routinely treated with immunosuppressive agents and these patients are susceptible to bacterial infections (Kosmidis and Chandrasekar, 2012) . Affected bone is an ideal incubator for periodontal and periapical bacteria, chronically stimulating inflammatory and immune responses (Ricucci and Siqueira, 2008; Rokadiya and Malden, 2008; Heitz-Mayfield and Lang, 2010) . Although the disease can occur spontaneously, 90% of cases are coupled with surgical dental treatment, such as tooth extractions, mandibular exostoses, periodontal disease, and local trauma from ill-fitting dentures.",

BP treatment may change the oral environment of the patient and BRONJ may be supported by increased bacterial adhesion to bone coated with BPs (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011) . The bone exposition during the surgery or during tooth extraction acts as a trigger opening the door for bacterial invasion. As a result, it creates a more favorable condition for the growth of oral pathogens on the bone surface that may be a contributing factor to the development of BRONJ. To delineate the BRONJ pathogenesis, it is vital to identify the bacterial species \u2044 phylotypes that colonize jawbone associated with BRONJ. Moreover, it is not well understood whether the bacteria involved in bone infection associated with BRONJ is similar or different to other biofilm associated bone infections in the oral cavity (Ruggiero et al, 2004; Sedghizadeh et al, 2008 Sedghizadeh et al, , 2009 (Ruggiero et al, 2009) .",

DGGE analysis results demonstrate that each group has its unique pattern of 16S rDNA species and displayed statistically significant clustering of profiles (Figures 2-3) . The banding pattern indicated that some bacterial species \u2044 phylotypes present in one group were either reduced in numbers or absent in other group (Figure 2) . The results of our study also demonstrated that the DGGE profiles of each group type formed significant group-specific clusters. Moreover, the overall BRONJ and control profiles were more similar within each group than between the groups, which suggest the presence of Bacterial diversity in jawbone of BRONJ X Wei et al Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, which are associated with other bacterial infections in oral cavity, were present in both groups (Paster et al, 2001; Kumar et al, 2005; Vickerman et al, 2007; Sedghizadeh et al, 2008 Sedghizadeh et al, , 2009 ). The phylum Fusobacteria (15%) was detected only in the control group, whereas the phylum TM7 was only found in BRONJ group (2%). Species within this phylum have been commonly identified in both healthy subjects and those with periodontitis (Paster et al, 2001) . It was reported that TM7 was strongly associated with subgingival plaques (Paster et al, 2001; Brinig et al, 2003; Ouverney et al, 2003; Ledder et al, 2007) , and there are no cultured representatives of this phylum. The top three genera ranked among the BRONJ group were Streptococcus (29%), Eubacterium (9%), and Pseudoramibacter (8%), while in the control group were Parvimonas (17%), Streptococcus (15%), and Fusobacterium (15%) ( Figure 5 ). Actinomyces are usually considered as opportunistic pathogens, and many species in this genus have been reported to be associated with periodontal disease, osteomyelitis, as well as BRONJ (Fine et al, 1999; Slots and Ting, 1999; Tonetti and Mombelli, 1999; Hansen et al, 2006; Estilo et al, 2008; Naik and Russo, 2009 ). However, in our BRONJ samples, we did not observe high number of Actinomyces. Naik and Russo (Naik and Russo, 2009) reported the presence of the actinomyces-like organisms from bone associated with BRONJ and in an another study using histomorphometric analysis of oral mucosa and jawbones have shown that Actinomyces is associated with BRONJ (Kaplan et al, 2009) ; however, most of these assumptions were based only on microscopic observations. We used molecular 16S rRNA gene and Actinomyces primers in combination of universal primers (Olson et al, 2007; Sakamoto et al, 2008) but did not observe high abundance of Actinomyces as indicated by DGGE gel (Figure 2 , lower bottom bands) and sequencing. More significantly, we identified 13 strains that were only present in BRONJ ( Table 2 ). The presence of these opportunistic organisms such as Finegoldia magna, gram-positive bacteria responsible for prosthetic infections, septic arthritis, and other bone and joint infections (Levy et al, 2009) ; Moryella indoligenes, grampositive bacteria responsible for abscess (Carlier et al, 2007) ; Oribacterium, gram-negative after staining but structurally gram-positive responsible for maxillary sinusitis and its major metabolic end products are acetic, butyric, and lactic acids (Carlier et al, 2004) ; Selenomonas infelix, gram-negative anaerobic bacilli normally found in human buccal flora and can cause bacteremia and lung abscess in a patient with cancer (Bisiaux-Salauze et al, 1990) ; and species of Porphyromonas and Prevotella, responsible for endodontic infections (Gomes et al, 2005) , indicated that BRONJ lesions \u2044 bone are colonized by different bacteria than those that are present in other biofilm-associated jawbone infections.",

We used S Chao 1 and S ACE estimator to determine the real phylotype abundance distributions in our samples (Kemp and Aller, 2004) . The ratio of observed phylotypes to predicted S Chao1 was 0.65 for control group and 0.71 for BRONJ group, and the ratio of observed phylotypes to predicted S ACE was 0.64 for control group and 0.59 for BRONJ group. These data suggested that with larger sample size, a more precise estimate of phylotype richness would be possible. However, the Shannon index, which indicates rarity and commonness of species, indicated that control and BRONJ had high species evenness and richness. The diversity of bacteria in the control group (H\u00a2 = 3.83 \u00b1 0.1) was greater than that in BRONJ group (H\u00a2 = 3.71 \u00b1 0.1). Simpson index, which represents the number of species present, as well as the abundance of each species, indicated that both the groups had \u20210.96, which meant that the probability of two clones from one of the groups that belonged to the same species was \u00a34%. The Good's coverage and evenness index indicated that our sequencing results covered 85% of species present in BRONJ samples, and the individuals (species) were distributed more evenly in BRONJ group than the controls. These data proved that the sample sets had high bacterial diversity and richness, and with limited sample size, we can determine the bacterial profile associated with each group.",

            "text": "There are many hypotheses for BRONJ pathogenesis (Allen and Burr, 2009 ) the manifestation of necrotic bone resulting from BP-induced remodeling suppression that allow accumulation of non-viable osteocytes, direct cytotoxic effect of BPs on osteocytes, BPs antiangiogenic effects, and role of oral bacteria. Our observations indicated that the BRONJ bone was colonized by bacteria, and the bacterial phylotypes were different from other bone infections in the oral cavity not associated with BP therapy. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant cause of osteomyelitis, and the composition of local flora may allow other pathogens access to the bone; however, in our study, we did not detect any S. aureus which indicated that there may be other oral bacteria which can trigger bone infection in BRONJ. Bacterial profile of our control group was similar to other jawbone infection like caries and periodontal disease (Dewhirst et al, 2010) . The BRONJ group had totally different bacterial phylotypes that are not associated with other jawbone infections (Table 2 ), but are known to cause other opportunistic infections. The plausible basis for BRONJ development is also the increased bacterial adhesion to the BP-covered bone (Allen and Burr, 2009; Kos and Luczak, 2009 ). Kos and Luczak (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011) proposed that BRONJ may result from increased bacterial adhesion to bone coated with BPs. In their mouse models, zoledronic acid promoted the adherence and proliferation of S. mutans to hydroxyapatite, suggesting that zoledronic acid may increase bacterial infection. They further suggested that this could be mediated by proteins termed \u00d4microbial surface components which Bacterial diversity in jawbone of BRONJ X Wei et al recognize adhesive matrix molecules' (MSCRAMM) and that the binding of gram-positive strains was attributed to the amino-terminal domain of MSCRAMM structure that may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of infection (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011) . Similarly, in our studies, we observed that BRONJ bone was colonized by bacteria which were different from bone infections that were not associated with BP, indicating that BP may play a significant role in bacterial colonization of jawbone. The cationic amino group of nitrogen-containing BPs may attract bacteria by direct electrostatic interaction, through a direct surface protein interaction or by providing an amino acid mimic on the surface of the bony hydroxyapatite that interacts with MSCRAMM component and mediates increased bacterial adhesion (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011) . We did not observe high number of S. mutans, but we did observe high number of organisms that belong to genus Streptococcus and other organisms such as Oribacterium. It is also hypothesized that the bone is healthy until it is injured and infected with specific oral bacteria, and reduced resorptive ability caused by BP hinders the formation of new bone or there may be vascular damage caused by BP (Street et al, 2002; Aspenberg, 2006; Bi et al, 2010) . Infection could contribute to BRONJ by enhancing osteoclastindependent bone resorption. BRONJ tissue consistently shows a prevalence of scalloped bone surfaces, a seemingly paradoxical property, given the effect of BPs on bone resorption. Bacteria and associated fibroblastlike cells have the capacity to directly resorb bone, independent of osteoclasts, by liberating various acids and proteases (Allen and Burr, 2009) .",
