Spallanzani\", Rome, with fever and respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was accomplished using real-time RT-PCR [1] on a nasopharyngeal swab and sputum for patient 1 and on a nasopharyngeal swab for patient 2, collected 1 day after symptom onset. Partial sequencing confirmed both patients to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

At the time of writing, virus isolation from the nasopharyngeal swab sample collected from patient 2 was not successful, likely due to the lower viral load (higher cycle threshold value, 24.56 in the real-time RT-PCR), therefore no further analysis was performed on the virus detected in patient 2. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on the respiratory samples from patient 1 and on the primary isolate, prior to any further passage, by using the Ion Torrent S5 platform (Thermofisher). The mean count of sequencing reads obtained per sample was 44 000 000 (minimum 41.6 \u00c2 10 6 to maximum 49.7 \u00c2 10 6 ). The reads from the two respiratory samples of patient 1 were merged to obtain a better coverage along the virus genome, and in this paper are referred to as data from the clinical sample.

When applied to SARS-CoV-2 in this study, the analysis of sequence variability supported the presence of viral quasispecies in the clinical sample as well as in the primary isolate. Namely, two positions with variant frequency >10% were observed in the biological sample, both in Orf1a: A2269T, synonymous, and G7388A, corresponding to amino acid change A2375T. The synonymous variant A2269T, representing a minority variant in the clinical sample, was the dominant one in the isolate. Although low coverage may have affected the precise calculation of minority variant frequency in the clinical sample, the data are consistent with variant selection occurring during the isolation procedure, as previously shown for other respiratory viruses. In the respiratory sample neither mutations nor intra-sample variants were found at positions 8782 and 28 144, recently identified as hotspots of hypervariability (coverage: 61x and 76x respectively) [5] .",
