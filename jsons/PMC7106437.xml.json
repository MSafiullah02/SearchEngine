Between January, 2015, and May, 2016, more than 1\u00b72 million people have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, including economic migrants hoping for a better life and refugees fleeing conflicts, political upheaval, ethnic discrimination, and religious persecution. The continuing swell of refugees worldwide is creating an ever-increasing economic and social burden on host countries and presents new public health challenges, alongside the deeper humanitarian and social issues. With such mass involuntary migration\u2014and the associated overcrowding, poor sanitation, and restricted access to clean water\u2014often comes a substantial increase in risk of infectious disease outbreaks, depending on the context. For example, after an official declaration of cholera outbreaks in Iraq in September, 2015, and with the continued degradation of health services and surveillance infrastructure in neighbouring Syria, the risk of disease contagion and large-scale outbreaks occurring in the wider region is increasing.2\n",

As a result, policies and interventions in high-income countries taking in refugees will be increasingly framed mainly in relation to risks to national security rather than equity and global health security. We propose three broad contributions that could be made by the global health community to help assess, better inform, and reduce potential infectious disease risks associated with incoming refugees, and improve social integration in relation to the refugee crisis in Europe.",

The arduous journey that many refugees have endured might increase their risk of infectious diseases\u2014particularly of measles and food and water-borne diseases to which they are at an increased risk if immunisation programmes were interrupted in their countries of origin.7 However, despite the commonly held view of an association between migration and spread of infectious diseases, no systematic association has been shown with many of the infectious diseases of concern. For example, enteric fever is already reported in the European region with most cases occurring in returning travellers rather than refugees or migrants. Additionally, the risk of other infectious diseases, including viral haemorrhagic fevers or Middle East respiratory syndrome, is low with most cases occurring in health-care workers or travellers rather than refugees.7 The threat of infectious disease outbreaks from population movements to Europe might thus be substantially less than perceived.",

The evidence must be clearly provided and understood by politicians and the general public. To generate a strong evidence base, a coordinated approach to health needs assessments and surveillance should be developed, leveraging institutional networks such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and its links to reference laboratories and individual national public health agencies. Estimation of the infectious disease risk to Europe from cholera, for example, should take into account the well developed public water and sanitation systems, excellent health infrastructure, and well integrated and responsive disease surveillance networks, all of which substantially reduce the chances of large outbreaks of cholera. Accurate communication of infectious disease risk assessments to the general public and policy makers is thus key to rationalise the broader debate for this issue.",

Although cases traceable to Syria were identified in Iraq,8 no cases were identified in asymptomatic toddlers screened in Germany.9 Yet, both the medical10 and lay press coverage had extensively discussed the so-called polio threat in view of low vaccination rates in the UK and Germany. What these reports did not consider was the ability of the global system to respond appropriately. The global response in that instance was measured, and risk communication on the whole was effective, with WHO's Emergency Committee's declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The declaration brought WHO's Global Polio Eradication Initiative together with different organisations to complete several rounds of vaccinations in affected areas, and was effective at controlling the outbreak and minimising risk of spread.",

These poor baseline health conditions might be exacerbated by provision of inadequate health services at refugee reception or processing centres, which can thus become a risk to the collective health of host populations. For example, conditions in Australia's Nauru and Manus Island detention centres for offshore processing have resulted in outbreaks of infectious diseases.21 By contrast, the strong system of vaccination surveillance in Germany identified low measles immunisation in incoming refugees to Lower Saxony; measures are being taken to vaccinate arriving groups, illustrating how evidence can be used to reduce health inequalities in refugees and host communities. The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015\u2013202022 details the importance of equitable access to vaccination and to encourage access for refugees and migrants with culturally appropriate services.7\n",

These efforts are important and build on the continuing work of WHO's Europe Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project,28 which has developed both evidence-based guidance and a series of tools to assist countries to assess and address the health needs of migrant and refugee populations.

The 2015 EU agreement29 to provide US$1\u00b79 billion to address the drivers of outward migration from Africa implied some recognition of these drivers of migration. Hopefully, some of that fund could be used to support more equitable structuring of economic and commercial agreements between LMICs and high-income countries, and a more equal sharing of profits.
