For example, Cui et al. [11] investigated the impact of media coverage on the spread and control of infectious diseases (such as SARS) in a given region/area. Xiao et al. [12] analyzed a mathematical model on an infectious disease system with a piecewise smooth incidence rate concerning media/psychological effect. In particularly, when media coverage is present, social distancing mechanisms come into effect. The reporting by media can be assumed to be an increasing function of the number of infectious cases present, and consequently, the effective contact rate between susceptible and infectious individuals should be a decreasing function of the number of infectious cases present. Therefore the effective contact rate can be described by the following non-linear function [11]: \u03b21\u2212\u03b22f(I),where \u03b21 and \u03b22 are respectively the direct contact transmission coefficient and the maximum reduced contact rate due to the presence of protected individuals affected by the media coverage.

Semenza and Menne\u2019s experimental results [14] presented that the effects of global climate change on infectious diseases are hypothetical until more is known about the degree of change in temperature and humidity that will occur. Thomas and Kevin [8] pointed out that global climate change may cause considerable uncertainty about the rates of change. Therefore, the environmental fluctuation (uncertainty change in temperature or humidity) may translate to affect the transmission rate of infectious diseases [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].

More precisely, the main aim is to obtain the completed threshold results and the existence of stationary distribution of stochastic epidemic model (1.3). As far as we know, there is rare result of model (1.3) with respect to a completely threshold and its statistical characters (i.e., the existence of stationary distribution).",

            "text": "As well known, there are different potential methods to introduce the environmental noise into a deterministic model. In [24], the authors used a white noise type that is directly proportional to S(t),I(t) and influences on dS(t)dt,dI(t)dt, respectively. However, model (1.2) in this paper, we focus on the effect of environmental fluctuation on the key parameter \u03b21 in epidemic models. The diffusion term of model (1.2) is not only dependent on S(t) but also on I(t) in a nonlinear form \u03c3SIS+IdB(t). Moreover, the random noises for the two subpopulations (S(t) and I(t)) are assumed to be correlated, which corresponds to the real situation when the system is suffered from the same environmental factor (such as meteorological conditions etc.). Mathematically, the random perturbations of model (2.4) in [24] are described by two independent standard Brownian motions Bi(t),i=1,2, while model (1.2) uses a degenerate type B(t). Since Fokker\u2013Planck equation corresponding to model (1.2) is of degenerate type, it is difficult to establish the existence of stationary distribution (unless the Markov semigroup theory is used for a two-dimensional system with degenerate type white noise, please see [16], [25]). Fortunately, there exists an invariant set \u03a0 for stochastic model (1.2), and thus it can be reduced to a one-dimensional system (1.3) with initial value (1.4). Then, using Feller\u2019s test we can establish the complete threshold, and applying the Khasminskii\u2019s method we can further prove the existence of stationary distribution.",

If it is not true, then there is a sufficiently small \u03b5\u2208(0,1) such that (3.8)P(\u03a91)>\u03b5,where \u03a91={lim supt\u2192\u221eI(\u03c9,t)\u2264\u03be\u22122\u03b5}. For every \u03c9\u2208\u03a91, there is a T=T(\u03c9)>0 such that when t\u2265T(\u03c9), (3.9)I(t,\u03c9)\u2264\u03be\u2212\u03b5.Clearly, we can choose \u03b5 small enough such that f(0)>f(\u03be\u2212\u03b5). According to (3.5)\u2013(3.7), when t\u2265T(\u03c9) we have (3.10)f(I(t,\u03c9))\u2265f(\u03be\u2212\u03b5).By the large number theorem for martingales [28], there is an \u03a92\u2282\u03a9 and P(\u03a92)=1 such that for every \u03c9\u2208\u03a92: (3.11)limt\u2192\u221e1t\u222b0t\u03c3(N\u2212I(s,\u03c9))dB(s,\u03c9)=0.Now, for any fixed \u03c9\u2208\u03a91\u2229\u03a92, it then follows from (3.4), (3.10) that for t\u2265T(\u03c9), we have ln(I(t,\u03c9))\u2265ln(I0)+\u222b0T(\u03c9)f(I(s,\u03c9))ds+f(\u03be\u2212\u03b5)(t\u2212T(\u03c9))+\u222b0t\u03c3(N\u2212I(s,\u03c9))NdB(s,\u03c9).This results in lim inft\u2192\u221e1tln(I(t,\u03c9))\u2265f(\u03be\u2212\u03b5)>0.Thus, limt\u2192\u221eI(t,\u03c9)=\u221e.However, this contradicts with (3.10). We therefore must have the desired assertion (3.1).Similarly, we can prove assertion (3.2). If it is not true, then there is a sufficiently small \u03ba\u2208(0,1) such that P(\u03a93)>\u03ba,where \u03a93={lim inft\u2192\u221eI(\u03c9,t)\u2265\u03be+\u03ba}. Hence, for every \u03c9\u2208\u03a93, there is a \u03c4=T(\u03c9)>0 such that when t\u2265\u03c4(\u03c9), (3.12)I(t,\u03c9)\u2265\u03be+\u03ba.Now, for any fixed \u03c9\u2208\u03a93\u2229\u03a92. It then follows from (3.4), (3.11) that for t\u2265\u03c4(\u03c9), ln(I(t,\u03c9))\u2264ln(I0)+\u222b0\u03c4(\u03c9)f(I(s,\u03c9))ds+f(\u03be+\u03ba)(t\u2212\u03c4(\u03c9))+\u222b0t\u03c3(N\u2212I(s,\u03c9))NdB(s,\u03c9).That is, lim supt\u2192\u221e1tln(I(t,\u03c9))\u2264f(\u03be+\u03ba)<0.Whence limt\u2192\u221eI(t,\u03c9)=0.This contradicts with (3.12), we thus have the desired assertion (3.2).  \u25a1\n",

So we may assume that the average population number in large-scale cites is about N=13827000, and in middle-scale cites, it is about N=1382700. Therefore, for model (1.3), we choose two different size scale population N=13827000 and N=1382700, which represent respectively two kinds of audience scopes of media coverage. The others parameters are the same as in Table 1. It can be obviously observed from Fig. 5 that the effect of same intensity environmental fluctuation (\u03c3) may result in a more stronger fluctuation of I(t) for the larger size scale population (N=13827000), that is to say, the smaller size scale of the population is less sensitivity to the environmental fluctuation.

Dynamical modeling of infectious disease has become a powerful tool to improve our understanding of the pattern of epidemic spread and develop better controlling strategies [41]. Meanwhile, in real situation, the environmental fluctuation should not be ignored. In this paper, we investigated a stochastic SIS epidemic model with both media coverage and environmental fluctuation. By using the Feller\u2019s test method, we obtained that the dynamical behavior of model (1.3) is completely determined by the stochastic basic reproduction number R0s\u2254R0d\u2212\u03c32\u22152(\u03bc+\u03b3). More precisely, if R0s\u22641, the disease will go to extinction; if R0s>1, the disease will be stochastically persistent in some ranges and model (1.3) admits a stationary distribution with ergodicity. Our theoretical and numerical simulation results showed that the environmental fluctuation \u03c3, media coverage \u03b22 and population size scale N may exert important influences on an epidemic:",
