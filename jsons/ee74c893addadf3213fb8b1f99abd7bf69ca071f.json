For the geriatric population, telemedicine consultations can also help with overcoming isolation and loneliness due to disconnection with the external world. Moreover, by reducing the number of hospital visits for periodical consultations and prescriptions among the geriatric population with mental illnesses, telemedicine may potentially reduce the number of secondary or tertiary infections that could occur on route to the hospital or while waiting for care. Furthermore, telemedicine may also reduce the loss to follow up among psychiatric patients. Through telemedicine, doctors are able to continuously identify and manage each patient's condition, which may prevent patients from not receiving appropriate treatment if their psychiatric symptoms worsen.",
