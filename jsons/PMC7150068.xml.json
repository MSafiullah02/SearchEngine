Such new trends are also modifying the patterns of food production, distribution and consumption, integrating agricultural and food industries. Although international food trade offers many benefits to consumers, by bringing wider variety of foods to the market which are accessible, affordable, and meet consumer demands and provide opportunities for food-exporting countries to earn foreign exchange. The global value of food trade now exceeds US$500 billion. However, globalization of food trade has also brought new challenges and risks to food control and regulations and even a single source of contamination may become widespread, with global consequences. Antimicrobial resistance to food-borne pathogens; emergence of new pathogens, chemical contaminants, new technologies in food production and processing, like genetic engineering and nanotechnology, changing animal food production and animal husbandry practices, are impacting consumer safety (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005).",

Early warning system, based on robust risk assessment to inform action, is very useful in addressing health threats and their timely communication. In response to threats such as the avian influenza virus H5N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Global Early Warning System (GLEWS) for Transboundary Animal Diseases, including Zoonoses, was jointly established by WHO, FAO, and OIE. GLEWS builds on existing internal systems of three participating organizations to confidentially track and verify events in order to improve harmonization and decrease duplication. It embodies a unique cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary partnership for early identification and assessment of health risks at the human\u2013animal\u2013ecosystem interface. Joint WHO-FAO International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), is a voluntary global network of food safety authorities and provides an important platform for rapid exchange of information in case of food safety crises and for sharing data on both routine and emerging food safety issues. It tries to insure effective and rapid communication during food safety emergencies. To insure a comprehensive approach, GLEWS links with INFOSAN to insure and promote seamless action throughout food value chain within human\u2013animal\u2013ecosystem interface (WHO, 2013).",

This period has witnessed a gradual shift from a \u201chazards-based approach\u201d to food safety (i.e., mere presence of a hazard in a food was deemed unsafe) to a \u201crisk-based approach\u201d (determination whether exposure to a hazard has a meaningful impact on public health). Standard methods of analysis help in confirming that a food system is controlling a specific hazard. Through the selection of analytical method, sampling plan, and frequency of testing, a risk-based decision is introduced. Analysis of collected information is another challenge. Traditionally, food safety systems look at the individual steps along food chain, treating each step in isolation from others. However, as the systems become more complex, interactions and synergies between components become increasingly important and decrease utility of simple analyses of individual steps. When a high level of complexity is reached, impact of individual steps cannot be analyzed without considering the entire system.",

use.\u2022\u201cFood Safety Management System\u201d means the adoption of Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Hygienic Practices, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point and such other practices as may be specified by regulation, for the food business.\u2022\u201cPrimary food\u201d means an article of food, being a produce of agriculture or horticulture or animal husbandry and dairying or aquaculture in its natural form, resulting from the growing, raising, cultivation, picking, harvesting, collection, or catching in the hands of a person other than a farmer or fisherman.\u2022\u201cRisk\u201d in relation to any article of food, means the probability of an adverse effect on the health of consumers of such food and the severity of that effect, consequential to a food hazard.\u2022\u201cRisk analysis\u201d in relation to any article of food, means a process consisting of three components, that is, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication.\u2022\u201cRisk assessment\u201d means a scientifically based process consisting of the following steps: (1) hazard identification, (2) hazard characterization, (3) exposure assessment, and (4) risk characterization.\u2022\u201cRisk communication\u201d means the interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risks, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions.\u2022\u201cRisk management\u201d means the process, distinct from risk assessment, of evaluating policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the protection of health of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options.\u2022\u201cUnsafe food\u201d means an article of food whose nature, substance, or quality is so affected as to render it injurious to health.\n\nCAC (2013) has provided the authentic definitions related to Food Safety as under:\nHazard: a biological, chemical, or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect.\nRisk: a function of the probability of an adverse health effect and the severity of that effect, consequential to a hazard(s) in food.\nRisk analysis: a process consisting of three components: risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication.\nRisk assessment: a scientifically based process consisting of the following steps: (1) hazard identification, (2) hazard characterization, (3) exposure assessment, and (4) risk characterization.\nRisk management: the process, distinct from risk assessment, of weighing policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties, considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the health protection of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options.\nInterested parties: are risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and, as appropriate, other relevant parties and their representative organizations.\n\nRisk communication: the interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risk, risk-related factors, and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions.\nRisk assessment policy: documented guidelines on the choice of options and associated judgments for their application at appropriate decision points in the risk assessment such that the scientific integrity of the process is maintained.\nRisk profile: the description of the food safety problem and its context.\nRisk characterization: the qualitative and/or quantitative estimation, including attendant uncertainties, of the probability of occurrence and severity of known or potential adverse health effects in a given population based on hazard identification, hazard characterization, and exposure assessment.\nRisk estimate: the quantitative estimation of risk resulting from risk characterization.\nHazard identification: the identification of biological, chemical, and physical agents capable of causing adverse health effects and which may be present in a particular food or group of foods.\nHazard characterization: the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the nature of the adverse health effects associated with biological, chemical, and physical agents, which may be present in food. For chemical agents, a dose\u2013response assessment should be performed. For biological or physical agents, a dose\u2013response assessment should be performed if the data are obtainable.\nDose\u2013response assessment: the determination of the relationship between the magnitude of exposure (dose) to a chemical, biological, or physical agent and the severity and/or frequency of associated adverse health effects (response).\nExposure assessment: the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the likely intake of biological, chemical, and physical agents via food as well as exposures from other sources if relevant.\nFood safety objective (FSO): the maximum frequency and/or concentration of a hazard in a food at the time of consumption that provides or contributes to the appropriate level of protection (ALOP).\nPerformance criterion (PC): the effect in frequency and/or concentration of a hazard in a food that must be achieved by the application of one or more control measures to provide or contribute to a PO or an FSO.\nPerformance objective (PO): the maximum frequency and/or concentration of a hazard in a food at a specified step in the food chain before the time of consumption that provides or contributes to an FSO or ALOP, as applicable.\nAttrey (2008) has identified the definitions from QMS resources as under:\u2022\nQuality: is the totality of features and characteristics of a product showing its ability to meet stated or implied needs or degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils customer requirements.\u2022\nQuality management: are the coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to quality.\u2022\nSystem: is a set of interrelated and interfacing elements. Quality System is the organizational structure, responsibilities, procedures, processes, and resources for implementing quality management.\u2022\nManagement system: management system refers to what the organization does to manage its process or activities. It is a system to establish a Quality Policy and achieve quality objectives in an organization.\u2022\nQuality management system (QMS): it is a management system, which directs and controls an organization with regard to quality. QMS has a set of requirements that deal with each aspect of the activities of the organization that affect quality.\u2022\nQuality requirements: ISO family of standards represents an international consensus on good management practices with the aim of ensuring that the organization can time and again deliver the product or services that meet the client\u2019s quality requirements. These good practices are combined in a set of standardized requirements for QMS (e.g., ISO 22000, the Food Safety Management System (FSMS), which has two parts, namely, \u201cSystem Requirements\u201d and \u201cProduct Quality Requirements\u201d).\u2022\nQuality assurance (QA): all activities needed to provide adequate confidence that a product or service will fulfill the requirements for quality. All activities associated with the attainment of quality, constitute Quality Assurance. It is that part of quality management which focuses on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled.\u2022\nQuality control (QC): actions and systems to measure and regulate the \u201cquality,\u201d constitute Quality Control.\u2022\nImplementation: means putting all the intentions (Quality Policy and Objectives) into practice.\u2022\nProcess: consists of a series of actions, which produce a change or a set of interrelated or interacting activities which transforms inputs into outputs. A series of operations or steps that results in a product or service or a set of causes and conditions that work together to transform inputs into an output.\u2022\nProduct: in relation to the QMS, a product is either a tangible product obtained from raw materials through a series of standardized processes or it can be an intangible process/technology, a service or an information or scientific data, etc.\n\n",
