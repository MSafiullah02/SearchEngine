The virus was also then seen across West Africa and into Asia.5, 6 However, because Zika causes a mild illness with clinical similarities to dengue and many other tropical infectious diseases seen in the region, it was almost certainly mis-diagnosed and under-reported. The first large human outbreak was in the Pacific island of Yap in Micronesia in 2007.7\n",

Zika was not suspected (as it had not previously been known in South America) and was not initially tested for. Phylogenetic analysis of virus from seven early Zika patients has subsequently indicated that Zika may have been imported to Brazil between March and December 2013.10 However, in May 2015, Brazil confirmed the presence of circulating Zika virus and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO\u2014WHO's regional office for the Americas) recommended that countries in the Americas where the natural vector\u2014Aedes aegypti\u2014was present should develop and maintain surveillance systems for Zika and the capacity to diagnose it.11 Shortly after this, Brazil reported neurological disorders including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome apparently linked to Zika infection. Increasing numbers of cases led WHO to state: \u2018Given the worldwide spread of chikungunya and dengue, associated with urbanisation and globalisation, there is a potential risk of outbreaks of urban Zika virus infection in urban settings in any part of the world where the mosquito vector is present or may become established in future\u2019.12 Through 2016, numbers of suspected and confirmed cases of Zika infection rose steadily to a peak of \u223c18,000 cases per week before declining to the current (December 2016) weekly average of \u223c270 cases per week.",

As a further extension of learning from Ebola, the UN established a Zika Multi-Partner Trust Fund to help secure funds to support the R&D efforts.18 In response to the recognised difficulties in diagnostic testing for Zika,19 WHO issued a Target Product Profile in April to support and direct research efforts to develop better tests.20\n",

Third, the additional volume of travellers associated with the games, although important, was not significant against the background level of trade and tourist travel to Rio.
