The rapid transmission of COVID-19 infection as well as the higher case-fatality might exacerbate existing psychiatric disorders, and enhance the risk of new episodes. In addition, elderly subjects usually suffer from lower social support and require long-term care due to existing disabilities; this may significantly enhance loneliness, despair and hopelessness which are independent predictors of suicide. Furthermore, older patients may be not adequately treated particularly in territories where the activities of mental health services are drastically restricted due to quarantine, and only a limited access to Internet services and smart phones is allowed 5 . Last but not least, prejudices and discrimination towards marginalized individuals such as aged subjects with mental disorders may be generally reinforced in situations of social crisis, fear, frustration and uncertainty. Stigma is a relevant predictor of negative outcome and represents an important barrier to care, particularly when it coexists with social isolation.",

When compared with younger subjects, we found that subjects aged 65 or above with prolonged hospitalization in our hospital are more vulnerable to: i) environmental factors (e.g., social isolation and distance from family members, stay in intensive/subintensive units, communication difficulties due to therapeutic devices); ii) individual factors (COVID-19 possible neurotropic properties, impairments in insight and cognitive dysfunctions comorbid medical conditions, and use of multiple medications).",

We firmly believe that the management of older adults with psychiatric disorders really represents a major challenge in this difficult period. Unfortunately, inadequate attention has been provided for this vulnerable population while targeted interventions aimed to remove barriers to care need to be carefully planned.",
