            "text": "Arboviruses are so named because they are arthropod-borne and cycle between an arthropod vector (e.g. mosquito, biting midge, tick) and a vertebrate host. Arboviruses may cause disease in humans or livestock or both and examples include West Nile virus (WNV), bluetongue virus (BTV), dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Temperature affects arbovirus transmission through the geographic range and global distribution of the arthropod vector species and through the local density of arthropods and the rates at which the arthropods feed on and bite vertebrate hosts (Guis et al., 2012, Wittmann and Baylis, 2000, Carpenter et al., 2011, Turner et al., 2013). Temperature is also a major factor in arthropod vector competence which is the ability of an arthropod species or sub-population of species to transmit an arbovirus to a subsequent host individual through feeding, after itself being infected through a blood-meal from a previous viraemic vertebrate host (Mullens et al., 2004, Wittmann et al., 2002). Arthropods are poikilothermic and arboviruses thus have to infect the arthropod vector at the ambient temperature, the average of which may vary considerably depending on climate, season and local conditions (micro-climate). In this respect, understanding how vector competence varies with temperature is important for assessing not only the short term risk of a BTV epizootic in livestock for example but also the long term impact of climate change on the geographical range of an arbovirus (Guis et al., 2012, Wittmann and Baylis, 2000). The vector competence considered here is restricted to a given life cycle stage (namely the adult midge or mosquito) of the arthropod and does not include transstadial or transovarial transmission of the virus within the arthropod.",

In general arthropod vector competence increases with temperature as in the case of BTV in Culicoides biting midges (Wittmann and Baylis, 2000, Carpenter et al., 2011) and flaviviruses such as DENV and WNV in mosquitoes (Vogels et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2017). However, there are also a few specific arbovirus/vector combination examples for which the opposite effect has been observed (Samuel et al., 2016) with enhanced vector competence for arbovirus being associated with lower temperatures. For example, in a study with CHIKV in Ae. albopictus, Zouache et al. (2014) reared all the mosquito larval stages at 26 \u00b0C before testing the competence of the adult females to virus at 20 \u00b0C and 28 \u00b0C; 20 \u00b0C representing the low-temperature threshold recorded when local CHIKV transmission occurred during the Italian and French epidemics and 28 \u00b0C the typical average temperature in tropical regions. The 2010\u20131909 CHIKV strain in general showed higher transmission efficiencies in Brazilian Ae. albopictus mosquito populations at 20 \u00b0C compared to 28 \u00b0C while the 06\u2013021 CHIKV strain in general showed increased competence at the higher temperature (Zouache et al., 2014).",

In physical biochemistry, temperature has two independent effects. First, it affects the strength of the binding affinity between a virus and its host cell through the thermodynamic equilibrium constant Ka (Gale, 2017) according to Equation 1 (see Table 1\n) and second it affects the rate of biochemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation (Equation 2). The overall objective of the work here was to develop a mechanistic model for the effect of temperature on arthropod vector competence by linking Equation 1 and Equation 2. The main parameters of the model, in addition to temperature, would therefore be the thermodynamic terms, namely the changes in the enthalpy (\u0394Ha_virus) and entropy (\u0394Sa_virus) on virus binding to the arthropod midgut epithelial cells in Equation 1 and the kinetic terms, namely the activation energy (EA) and a \u201crate\u201d constant (pcomplete283) in Equation 2.",

            "text": "The advantage of this physical biochemistry-based approach is that three of these parameters, namely \u0394Ha_virus and \u0394Sa_virus (or some of their component terms according to Equation 3 and Equation 4 respectively) and EA can be measured in biochemical \u201ctest tube\u201d experiments (Carneiro et al., 2002, Fei et al., 2015, Scholtessik and Rott, 1969). In theory therefore it may be possible to partly parameterize a model for the effect of temperature on vector competence based on biochemical data obtained from molecular components isolated from the arbovirus and arthropod host cells. Furthermore, the model developed here identifies the data gaps, namely the pcomplete283 \u201crate\u201d term in Equation 2 and of great interest, the change in entropy on immobilization of the whole virus on its binding to the host cell, \u0394Sa_immob, in Equation 4. To the author's knowledge the \u0394Sa_immob term identified here through application of a thermodynamic analysis to virus binding has never been defined before let alone quantified. Its importance is therefore unknown but is potentially huge as discussed here. It is anticipated that through application of the model developed here to experimental virus binding data and to empirical vector competence data it may be possible to back calculate \u0394Sa_immob and pcomplete283. However, even if the mechanistic model developed here is never sufficient to replace insectary-based vector competence experiments measuring infection rates in live arthropods, it offers a novel approach that complements current statistical approaches (Carpenter et al., 2011) to relate experimental vector competence data to temperature by providing a thermodynamic/kinetic framework that naturally accommodates temperature through Equation 1 and Equation 2, the parameters of which are directly related to the molecular mechanisms of the various infection stages. Furthermore changing these parameters in the model e.g. on the basis of molecular structure data (Gale, 2018), could aid the interpretation and understanding of experimental vector competence data (Wittmann et al., 2002) in terms of molecular mechanisms, highlighting the direction of further experiments at the molecular level. For example, it is shown here that the thermodynamic nature of virus binding could determine whether significant transmission occurs at low temperatures or whether instead there is greatly diminished transmission. This is important for assessing the seasonal risks of BTV transmission in northern Europe, for example. The model here could also be used to develop a dose-response for infection of an arthropod at constant temperature although the probability of getting through the pathogen-recognition receptors of the innate immune system in the arthropod midgut would need to be modelled, perhaps using the thermodynamic approach developed for virus binding to mucins in the human intestinal tract model (Gale, 2018). Although not discussed here, this could provide useful information for arbovirus transmission in an arthropod at low challenge doses and hence separate \u201cdead end\u201d vertebrate host species from potential reservoir vertebrate host species on the basis of measured viral titres in their blood and hence in the blood-meal ingested by an individual arthropod. Insectary experiments to measure low transmission efficiencies at low virus challenge doses would require individual analysis of huge numbers of arthropods. The model could be used to model transmission efficiency in terms of two independent variables, namely arbovirus dose and vector temperature. A unique advantage of the model developed here is that the predicted differences in virus infectivity and vector competence are due to differences in the input parameters \u0394Ha_virus, \u0394Sa_virus, EA and pcomplete283 which in the arbovirus/arthropod infection process will be related to the gene sequences of specific viral and host proteins (see Gale, 2018). Thus this thermodynamic treatment may provide the link to relate genetic sequence data to virus infectivity and vector competence which is a major goal of current research.",

            "text": "The steps in the mechanistic model developed here for infection of an arthropod vector are shown in Fig. 1\n. The thermodynamic component of the model here focuses on arbovirus binding to the microvillae surface (the so-called brush borders) of the arthropod midgut epithelial cell which is the first step in infection of the arthropod (Forrester et al., 2012, Franz et al., 2015) and involves specific interactions between a receptor molecule (Cr) on the brush border surface and a (glyco)protein (GP) on the arbovirus coat. In the case of BTV for example, the Cr may be a sialic acid (SA) on the arthropod midgut epithelial cell surface (Zhang et al., 2010). Here three thermodynamic GP/Cr binding scenarios, namely enthalpy-driven (Fei et al., 2015), entropy-driven (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995) and entropy-assisted (Caro et al., 2017) are considered in terms of their impact in modulating the effect of temperature on the strength of virus binding to a midgut cell as represented by Ka. In enthalpy-driven binding, it is the large negative \u0394Ha_virus term in Equation 1 that dominates in maximizing Ka and overcoming an unfavorable negative \u0394Sa_virus term (see Table 2\n), while in entropy-driven binding it is the large positive \u0394Sa_virus term that overcomes an unfavorable positive \u0394Ha_virus term. In entropy-assisted binding a small positive \u0394Sa_virus term adds to a small negative \u0394Ha_virus term in maximizing Ka (Table 2). The magnitude of Ka together with the virus dose (\u223cVfree) in the midgut dictate the number (C.VT) of arthropod midgut cells with bound virus at a given temperature (Gale, 2018) according to Equation 5 and Equation 6. In addition to the strength of the binding of GP to Cr as represented by the thermodynamic dissociation constant, Kd_receptor (Xiong et al., 2013), two other factors affect Ka, namely the number, n, of GP/Cr contacts made on binding of the virus to a cell and the unknown entropy term \u0394Sa_immob (see above). The kinetic component as represented by pcompleteT in Equation 2 is the probability of spread of infectivity through the arthropod to its salivary glands at a given temperature once virus in the initial challenge dose in the ingested blood-meal has bound to a midgut cell brush border. This represents the rate of virus replication and has to be completed within the lifetime of the arthropod so that it can infect another vertebrate host through feeding before it dies. In this respect, the probability pcompleteT has an implicit time dimension. The thermodynamic output, C.VT, and kinetic output, pcompleteT, are linked through the standard \u201cdose-response\u201d relationship in Equation 7 to give the transmission efficiency (vector competence) at temperature T as represented by ptransmissionT.",

This provides a basis for understanding the outputs from the vector competence model;4To develop, using the best available data, a two-stage mechanistic model based on virus binding affinity and virus replication rate which can accommodate both the increases and decreases in vector competence with temperature observed experimentally; and5To identify mechanisms by which the effect of temperature on virus binding may be modulated and hence explain the temperature paradox. The temperature paradox is that according to thermodynamics, strong enthalpy-driven virus binding should be much weaker at higher temperatures.\n",

The \u0394Ha_receptor and \u0394Sa_receptor data for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) monomers binding to soluble SA glycans (sialyllactose) (Fei et al., 2015) and for human rhinovirus serotype 3 (HRV3) binding to soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995) are presented in Table 2 and are examples of enthalpy-driven and entropy-driven GP/Cr binding respectively. However, the Kd_receptor values for HA monomer/sialyllactose binding at 25 \u00b0C (Table 2) are much higher than the 10\u22123 M generally associated with HA monomer/SA binding (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006, Xiong et al., 2013). This may be because the sialyllactose (Cr) used in Fei et al. (2015) being soluble has a high degree of motional freedom such that the \u0394Sa_receptor values observed by Fei et al. (2015) (Table 2) are too negative to represent SA glycans in Cr immobilized on the host cell surface and thus the Kd_receptor values in Table 2 may be unrealistically high for the virus/host cell interaction. Indeed Caro et al. (2017) reported values of \u0394Sa_receptor for protein/ligand binding ranging from \u2212243 J/mol/K to +263 J/mol/K reflecting negative and positive values of \u0394SconfGP and \u0394SconfCr (Equation 10). For the model here it is desired to have realistic values of \u0394Sa_receptor and values of \u2212125 J/mol/K, +40 J/mol/K and +125 J/mol/K are therefore chosen for the enthalpy-driven, entropy-assisted and entropy-driven GP/Cr binding scenarios respectively, (Table 3\n) as these are well within the range reported by Caro et al. (2017). Rearranging Equation 8 and Equation 9, the magnitude of \u0394Ha_receptor required to achieve the specified Kd_receptor value of 10\u22123 M at 37 \u00b0C given an assumed or known value of \u0394Sa_receptor is calculated using Equation 11.",

The main conclusion was that the value of Ka over the range 105 to 1015 M\u22121 is critical in affecting Fc and hence the risk of infection. Here, Equation 5 is used to calculate the Ka values for which Fc equals 0.001, 0.5, and 0.999 representing 1 midgut cell with bound virus, half the midgut cells with bound virus and nearly all the midgut cells with bound virus, respectively (see below for description of midgut model).",

The \u0394Sa_immob term is itself comprised of several entropy terms (Equation 14). These include the changes in translational and rotational entropy of the whole virus (\u0394Strans and \u0394Srot respectively) and an entropic pressure (\u0394Smem) associated with bringing two membranes close together, as for example, when the virus envelope approaches the host cell membrane (Sharma, 2013).",

Therefore, some assumptions are made here to enable the significance of the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob to be assessed. Both \u0394Strans and \u0394Srot are negative for soluble protein-protein associations and the \u0394Strans + \u0394Srot term for binding of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase to its snake toxin inhibitor, fasciculin-2, is \u223c\u2212125 J/mol/K (Minh et al., 2005). \u0394Strans and \u0394Srot and hence \u0394Sa_immob would be expected to be much more negative for binding of a whole virus to a host cell. Thus, according to Mammen et al. (1998) the translational entropy of a molecule is related to the natural logarithm of its mass. On the basis of the molecular weights of Bromegrass mosaic virus at 4.6 \u00d7 106 Da (Bockstahler and Kaesberg, 1962) and Semliki Forest virus at 6.5 \u00d7 107 Da (Houk et al., 1990) \u0394Strans would be 6.5-fold and 9-fold higher, respectively, than that for fasciculin-2 at 6735 Da (Sigma-Aldrich, 2018). For the purpose of demonstration of the effect of \u0394Sa_immob here, \u0394Sa_immob is assumed to be 6-fold that for fasciculin-2 binding (Minh et al., 2005), i.e. 6 x \u2212125 J/mol/K = \u2212750 J/mol/K.",

The number of GP/Cr contacts per virion also depends on the number of GP molecules per virion and their spatial geometry. Xiong et al. (2013) estimate that 5.5 AIV HA monomers can bind to sugars from the geometry of the virus particles. Attachment of bluetongue virus (BTV) is mediated by the VP2 coat protein (Zhang et al., 2010) which is a trimer and presents three SA-binding pockets for interaction with SA glycans on the host cell surface (Zhang et al., 2010). Cell binding of BTV could involve more than one VP2 protein as there are 60 VP2 proteins per BTV virion (Zhang et al., 2010) and thus more than 3 GP/Cr contacts could be possible. Kuhmann et al. (2000) demonstrated that approximately four to six Cr molecules assemble around the HIV virion to form a complex needed for infection. Carneiro et al. (2002) estimated 7 GP/Cr contacts for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) binding, albeit to phospholipid bilayers. Overall it is concluded here that the number of GP/Cr contacts could range from 3 to 7 for spherical viruses. However, some viruses such as AIV and Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) form filaments (Seladi-Schulman et al., 2013, Dadonaite et al., 2016) which could make many more GP/Cr contacts during infection than spherical forms. Thus here up to 20 GP/Cr contacts are modelled for the purpose of demonstration.",

            "text": "\nForrester et al. (2012) define three main infectious transitions or stages during mosquito infection after taking a viraemic blood-meal from a vertebrate host: 1) midgut epithelial cells infection, 2) midgut escape, when the virus enters the haemocoel to infect secondary tissues, and 3) salivary gland infection resulting in release of virus with saliva for horizontal transmission to an uninfected vertebrate host (Smith et al., 2008, Franz et al., 2015). The spread of arbovirus through the midgut and salivary glands of a mosquito is shown schematically in Franz et al. (2015). For simplicity and to demonstrate proof of principle, the mechanistic model here (Fig. 1) is based on just two stages namely: 1) binding of virus in the blood-meal to the midgut epithelial cell brush borders through GP/Cr interactions, and 2) subsequent infection of the midgut cell followed by midgut escape and salivary gland infection. The first is the thermodynamic component, the second is the kinetic component. The output of the model is the probability of transmission, ptransmissionT, of an arbovirus by an arthropod at temperature T. This is defined as the probability of completion of infection of the arthropod salivary glands within the lifetime of the arthropod given the arthropod has ingested a blood-meal containing arbovirus. The time between initial oral challenge of the arthropod and the ability to infect a new vertebrate host is called the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and decreases with increasing temperature for orbiviruses in biting midges (Carpenter et al., 2011, Mullens et al., 2004, Wittmann et al., 2002) and mosquitoes (Liu et al., 2017), as does the lifetime of the arthropod (Wittmann and Baylis, 2000, Turner et al., 2013). In effect the transmission probability is the probability that the EIP is less than the lifetime of the arthropod. In the case of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) in Aedes taeniorhynchus mosquitoes, a single infected midgut epithelial cell may sometimes be sufficient to establish infection of the whole mosquito including its salivary glands (Smith et al., 2008). Indeed Smith et al. (2008) describe probabilistic events where \u223c23 infected midgut cells are needed to obtain infection in \u223c100% of mosquitoes, and \u223c1 infected midgut cell has a 50% probability of leading to infection of the whole mosquito. The model here builds on this probabilistic concept for the infected midgut cell by going back to the stage of initial binding of virus to the midgut epithelial cell surface and defining pcompleteT as the probability that, given a virion has bound to the surface of a midgut cell, that midgut cell becomes infected and its progeny viruses go on to infect the salivary gland so completing the arthropod infection process within the life time of the arthropod at temperature T. The model output, ptransmissionT, is related to the number of midgut cells (C.VT) with bound virus at temperature T according to Equation 7 and is the probability of at least one of those cells successfully infecting the rest of the arthropod at temperature T within its lifetime. Thus the more midgut cells (C.VT) with bound virus then the greater the chance that infection will reach the salivary glands from at least one of those midgut cells within the lifetime of the arthropod.",

            "text": "This is Stage 1 in Fig. 1. The thermodynamic equilibrium component is based on the mechanistic dose-response model developed for faecal-oral viruses in a human intestinal tract (Gale, 2018) and is applied to the midgut of the arthropod. The approach requires an estimate of the arthropod midgut volume, the number of epithelial cells lining the midgut (to which virus can bind) and the challenge dose in virions. The volume of blood ingested by an arthropod vector is related to the midgut volume and varies depending on the life cycle stage and the species of arthropod. Thus an adult female Culicoides variipennis biting midge is able to ingest \u223c10\u22124 ml (10\u221210 m3) (Fu, 1995) and larval tick stages ingest \u223c1 \u00b5l (10\u22129 m3) while adult ticks may ingest \u223c1 ml (10\u22126 m3) (Koch and Sauer, 1984). The luminal surface area of the mosquito midgut is 3 mm2 (3.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 m2) (Houk et al., 1990) and assuming a spherical shape, the volume of the midgut in an engorged female mosquito would be 0.49 mm3 (4.9 \u00d7 10\u221210 m3). Houk et al. (1990) estimated 10,000 epithelial cells in the mosquito midgut, although Smith et al. (2008) estimated that, of these, only 100 midgut cells in Ae. taeniorhyncus mosquitoes were actually susceptible to infection by VEEV even with high-titred blood-meals. For the purpose of the model here, the total number, Ctotal_midgut, of arthropod midgut epithelial cells able to bind virus is assumed to be 103 and the arthropod midgut volume is assumed to be 10\u22126 dm3 (10\u22129 m3). The arbovirus challenge dose in the midgut, Vtotal, used here is relatively high and fixed at 105 virions which is representative of vector competence experiments (Liu et al., 2017, Vogels et al., 2016, Zouache et al., 2014) which use a high dose in the blood-meal (typically 107.5 pfu cm\u22123) to ensure a high chance of infecting a high proportion of the arthropods at optimum temperature. Here it is assumed that all 105 virions have reached the midgut and are contained within the midgut for long enough to reach dynamic equilibrium with epithelial cells according to Equation 12. This Vtotal of 105 virions is realistic based on Kay and Jennings (2002) feeding individual mosquitoes doses of 20,000 TCID50 of Ross River virus and consistent with Smith et al. (2008) feeding \u223c10\u22123 cm3 volume blood-meals of up to 108 VEEV pfu/cm3 when taking into account that the TCID50 and pfu typically comprise many virions in the case of RNA viruses (Rodriguez-Calvo et al., 2011). Lower doses are not considered here. The advantage of using a high Vtotal that greatly exceeds Ctotal_midgut is that as previously demonstrated by Gale (2018) the fraction (Fc) of midgut cells with bound virus at temperature T can be calculated from Ka and the concentration of free virus in the midgut ([Vfree]) using Equation 5. Equation 5 simplifies the calculation and avoids the need for tedious difference equation approaches at low virus challenge doses (Gale, 2018). Furthermore since Vtotal at 105 virions greatly exceeds Ctotal_midgut at 103 cells, Vtotal may be used as an approximation for Vfree in Equation 5. This is analogous to the Michaelis equation in enzyme kinetics where [substrate] >>[enzyme]. Thus even when all the midgut cells have a single bound virus, Vfree = 105 \u2013 103 = 99,000 \u223c Vtotal. Using the Avogadro number, L = 6.02 \u00d7 1023 particles/mole, and a midgut volume of 10\u22126 dm3, [Vfree] is approximately constant at 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221213 M. For each temperature, T, Ka is calculated from Equation 16 and used to calculate Fc from Equation 5. Finally, C.VT is calculated from Equation 6 and used in Equation 7.",

The probability pcompleteT depends on rates of biochemical processes including rate of entry of bound virus to the midgut cell, rate of virogenesis and budding and rate of spread through the mosquito to the salivary glands and is assumed here to be a kinetic process related to temperature over the 10 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C range at least. In chemical kinetics, the rate of reaction, k, is modelled by the Arrhenius equation which is based on the activation energy EA. EA is often positive (representing an energy barrier to be overcome) and k increases exponentially with increasing temperature as more molecules acquire the kinetic energy to overcome EA. Rates of viral protein synthesis and nucleic acid replication increase with temperature (below protein denaturation temperatures). For example, Scholtessik and Rott (1969) demonstrated that the rates of synthesis of AIV HA and neuraminidase (NA) increased with temperature from 28 \u00b0C to 34 \u00b0C and the enzymatic activity of the AIV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) increased from 24 \u00b0C to 36 \u00b0C, peaking at 38 \u00b0C and then falling by 40 \u00b0C as the enzyme was completely inactivated by heat at 41 \u00b0C. Here, the kinetic component of infection of an arthropod by an arbovirus is modelled using the Arrhenius equation where k is replaced by the probability, pcompleteT (Equation 2) and pcomplete283 is the probability that a single midgut cell with bound virus results in successful infection of the salivary glands within the lifetime of the arthropod at a temperature of 283 K i.e. 10 \u00b0C. The magnitude of pcomplete283 covers a number of factors in the host pathogen response including the ability of the virus to enter and then replicate in the host cell once attached and then bud (Gale, 2018) and also the immunity of the arthropod to the virus. Thus the more immune the arthropod is to an arbovirus then the lower the magnitude of pcomplete283 in Equation 2 and hence the lower the magnitude of pCompleteT as the probability of spread of the virus through the arthropod decreases. It should be noted that the units of pcompleteT are not those of rate (s\u22121) because pcomplete283 is a dimensionless probability in Equation 2. It was checked that pcompleteT did not exceed 1 at the temperature of 35 \u00b0C as it is a probability.",

(2002). In Table 5, \u0394Ha_virus values required to achieve a range of Kd_virus values at 37 \u00b0C for three different \u0394Sa_virus scenarios are calculated using Equation 11. For each \u0394Ha_virus the decrease in Ka on increasing the temperature from 10 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C is calculated using Equation 15. Kd_virus values reported for viruses are in the 10\u22129 to 10\u221215 M range (Xiong et al., 2013), for which Ka is decreased by six-fold to 20-fold between 10 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C if \u0394Sa_virus is negligible. To compensate the huge \u0394Sa_virus of \u221216,062 J/mol/K from Carneiro et al. (2002) requires \u0394Ha_virus in the range of \u22125000 kJ/mol according to Equation 11 such that the decrease in Ka over the 10 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C temperature range is \u223c1076\u2013fold even for the weakest binding i.e. Kd_virus of 10\u22123 M (at 37 \u00b0C). Even using a more realistic value of \u0394Sa_virus = \u2212750 J/mol/K (derived in Methods) gives decreases in Ka of 19,000-fold to 66,000-fold over the 10 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C temperature range for viruses with Kd_virus of 10\u22129 to 10\u221215 M at 37 \u00b0C (Table 5).",

It can be seen that the sensitivity of Ka to increasing n depends on the temperature and that this sensitivity is different for the enthalpy-driven (Fig. 3a), entropy-assisted (Fig. 3d) and entropy-driven (Fig. 3e) GP/Cr binding scenarios despite each having the same Kd_receptor of 10\u22123 M at 37 \u00b0C. Thus, the effect of increasing the number of GP/Cr contacts on enhancing virus binding is much more marked at the lower temperature of 10 \u00b0C compared to 35 \u00b0C for the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr scenarios in Fig. 3a, b, and c with the difference between Ka at 10 \u00b0C compared to 35 \u00b0C increasing with n according to Equation 15. This is due to the negative \u0394Ha_receptor in enthalpy-driven binding (Tables 2 and 3) such that binding affinity is increased at lower temperatures as for all exothermic processes. In contrast, the sensitivity of Ka to changing the number of the entropy-assisted GP/Cr contacts in Fig. 3d is less affected by temperature reflecting the smaller magnitude of \u0394Ha_receptor (Table 3). Indeed, with \u0394Sa_receptor = +57.4 J/mol/K, a Kd_receptor of 10\u22123 M (37 \u00b0C) is achieved with \u0394Ha_receptor = 0 kJ/mol (Equation 11) and there is then no temperature effect on Ka (Equation 15) with the lines for all temperatures being overlaid (not shown). While the entropy-assisted binding of GP to Cr minimizes temperature sensitivity of increasing n, the entropy-driven binding of GP to Cr actually reverses the temperature sensitivity such that the effect of increasing the number of GP/Cr contacts on enhancing virus binding is more marked at higher temperatures (Fig. 3e, f). This is due to the positive \u0394Ha_receptor (Tables 2 and 3) such that binding affinity is increased at higher temperatures as for all endothermic processes. It is assumed that \u0394Ha_receptor is constant over the 10 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C temperature range which is acceptable.",

The low temperature differences are more apparent when the transmission probabilities are log-transformed (Fig. 4d). Thus the lower the temperature, the more the transmission efficiency with entropy-driven GP/Cr binding is diminished relative to that of enthalpy-driven binding although there is no minimum temperature threshold. Thus replacing n = 4 enthalpy-driven GP/Cr contacts with n = 4 entropy-driven contacts decreases transmission by 135-fold at 10 \u00b0C but only by 1.4-fold at 35 \u00b0C. All three curves in Fig. 4c,d intercept at 37 \u00b0C because they each have the same Kd_receptor of 10\u22123 M at 37 \u00b0C. The predicted changes in C.VT with temperature for the three thermodynamic scenarios for WNV binding to Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens midgut epithelial cells are compared in Fig. 5\n.

Thus the \u0394Sa_virus /R term is the y-axis intercept for lnKa when plotted against 1/T. This is apparent in Fig. 2 where with the \u0394Sa_virus of \u221216,062 J/mol/K as reported by Carneiro et al. (2002), the change in Ka for binding of VSV to phospholipid bilayers is biologically significant (i.e. 106 M\u22121 <Ka <1015 M\u22121) over the temperature range of 30 \u00b0C to 33 \u00b0C. However increasing \u0394Sa_virus by 500 J/mol/K to \u221215,562 J/mol/K shifts the range of biologically significant Ka to temperatures above the biologically relevant temperature range, i.e. >40 \u00b0C (Fig. 2), such that at all temperatures below 40 \u00b0C, the Ka is >1015 M\u22121. Conversely decreasing \u0394Sa_virus by 500 J/mol/K to \u221216,562 J/mol/K hugely decreases the binding affinity (Fig. 2), such that at temperatures above 26 \u00b0C the Ka is less than 1 M\u22121 and there is a \u201crepulsive\u201d force between virus and host cell.",

The enthalpy-driven and entropy-driven scenarios are supported by some experimental data for virus GP/Cr interactions (Table 2), but are modified for modelling in Table 3, firstly so that each GP/Cr interaction scenario has the same Kd_receptor of 10\u22123 M (37 \u00b0C) to represent a single BTV VP2 SA binding pocket interaction with an SA and secondly so the \u0394Sa_receptor values are not too extreme. X-ray structure data for MERS-CoV and EBOV GPs\u2019 binding to their respective Crs (Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016, Yuan et al., 2015) suggest many virus GP/Cr interactions are enthalpy-driven although HRV3/ICAM-1 is one example of entropy-driven virus binding as reported by Casasnovas and Springer (1995) (Table 2). Indeed, Carneiro et al. (2002) reported a huge \u0394Ha_virus of \u22124958 kJ/mol driving the binding of VSV, and concluded that virus binding was enthalpy-driven. To the author's knowledge entropy-assisted binding has not been documented for virus GP/Cr systems, although it has been demonstrated for protein/protein interactions (Table 2) and for about a quarter of the 28 protein/ligand complexes studied by Caro et al. (2017) the conformational entropy change assisted the driving of specific binding. There is much indirect evidence to support the important contribution of entropy in GP/Cr binding. Thus according to De Graaf and Fouchier (2014) among the major difficulties of X-ray crystallography structural studies of AIV HA interacting with SA receptors are the flexible nature of both the HA protein and the glycan structure, which is largely undetectable in crystallography. This motional freedom is consistent with the importance of \u0394SconfGP and \u0394SconfCr in the GP/Cr interaction, as is the presence of IDRs in many viral proteins (Dolan et al., 2015) and their receptors (Fong et al., 2009).",

However, the biologically significant range of Ka is from 106 to 1015 M\u22121 such that for Ka >1015 M\u22121, temperature induced changes in Ka have no biological effect on infectivity either because at high virus challenge doses all the 1000 arthropod midgut cells have bound virus, or because at low virus challenge doses all the virus is bound to midgut cells (Gale, 2018). Similarly, Kas below 106 M\u22121 require unachievably high virus challenge doses for a realistic chance of infection at the individual arthropod level. It should be noted that a Ka of <106 M\u22121 does not represent a threshold just because Fc is less than 0.001 (albeit with an unrealistically high challenge dose of 109 virions), and it should be stressed that Fc decreases linearly with decreasing Ka (Gale, 2018). Indeed at the arthropod population level where infection of 1 in 1000 arthropods may be epidemiologically significant in disease transmission, the low Ka values may be biologically important. Thus a Ka of 6.0 \u00d7 106 M\u22121 would give virus binding in 1 in 106 midgut cells, i.e. 1 in 1000 midgut cells in just one of a 1000 individual arthropods (each receiving a blood-meal of 105 virions which is realistic). It is suggested that Ka \u223c106 M\u22121 may be epidemiologically significant in arbovirus transmission depending on the number of arthropods and their biting rates. The biologically significant range of Ka (106 M\u22121 to 1015 M\u22121) for the individual arthropod midgut is very similar to that for the human intestine model (Gale, 2018), suggesting the effective range of Ka is not affected by the volume of the midgut (10\u22126 dm3) or the intestine (0.314 dm3; Gale (2018)), and would also apply to other virus routes such as AIV in the fluid in a lung for example.

The results in Table 5 and Fig. 2 demonstrate that Ka may be decreased by orders of magnitude for enthalpy-driven GP/Cr binding over relatively small temperature increases depending on the magnitudes of n and \u0394Ha_receptor. Since the \u201cn x \u0394Ha_receptor\u201d term (and hence \u0394Ha_virus) is constant, the change in Ka with temperature according to Equation 15 does not depend on whether there is one single interaction of enthalpy \u0394Ha_virus kJ/mol or multiple (n) interactions each of \u0394Ha_receptor kJ/mol which when summed give \u0394Ha_virus according to Equation 3. This is important because it might be thought that having multiple interactions each of very small \u0394Ha_receptor could alleviate the effect of temperature on Ka compared to a single large \u0394Ha_virus for example from a very high affinity single GP/Cr interaction.

The relative lack of importance of temperature between 10 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C reflects the relatively small values of \u0394Ha_receptor (Table 3) according to Equation 15. However, for AIV HA/siallylactose binding (Fig. 3b,c) the much more negative values of \u0394Ha_receptor (Table 2) result in much lower Ka values at the higher temperature (35 \u00b0C) so that many more GP/Cr contacts are needed to achieve a biologically significant Ka. Thus to achieve biological significance at higher temperatures with only a few GP/Cr contacts, it is beneficial for \u0394Ha_receptor not to be too negative, hence the potential benefit of entropy-assisted or entropy-driven GP/Cr binding.",

            "text": "Although the second (kinetic) stage also involves cell binding by the virus (e.g. to the salivary glands) this is ignored here in effect assuming that midgut cell brush border binding in the first stage is the most important binding process. This is justified because differences in mosquito vector competence are in part due to arbovirus-specific midgut epithelial Cr receptors on the brush borders (Franz et al., 2015). Indeed Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) bound with high affinity to brush border fragments (BBFs) from the midguts of susceptible Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes but not to those from refractory mosquitoes, confirming the importance of the appropriate Cr molecules (Houk et al., 1990). The second stage lumps together all the infection stages of the arthropod following midgut cell surface binding and is entirely kinetic being based on the Arrhenius equation (Equation 2). Justification of this is as follows. First, infection of just one midgut cell is sufficient for a 50% probability of subsequent infection of the salivary glands in the case of VEEV in Ae. taeniorhynchus (Smith et al., 2008). This suggests the midgut escape, dissemination and salivary gland stages are more efficient than midgut infection and are not major barriers and can therefore be lumped together into a single kinetic component reflecting the time required for viral replication and spread within the arthropod. This is supported by the results of Vogels et al. (2016) showing that while oral challenge of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes with WNV resulted in salivary gland infection in only 2% \u2013 35% of mosquitoes depending on temperature (Fig. 4c), intrathoracic injection of WNV achieved salivary gland infection in 95% \u2013 100% mosquitoes at all temperatures (not shown). Intrathoracic injection by-passes the midgut entry, infection and escape stages. Second, Scholtessik and Rott (1969) concluded that the activity of RdRp is rate-limiting in AIV infection of cell cultures. Thus by analogy all that is needed for the kinetic component of the vector competence model here are the EA and pcomplete283 values for the rate-limiting step of the midgut cell infection, dissemination and salivary glands stages. This rate-limiting step being the slowest of these will limit pcompleteT and hence overall vector competence in Equation 7.",

            "text": "A formal validation cannot be performed here because of the lack of the required thermodynamic/kinetic parameters for arboviruses. For the next step in the development of this mechanistic model, data for the kinetic parameters, pcomplete283 and EA, and the thermodynamic parameters, n, \u0394Ha_receptor, \u0394Sa_receptor and \u0394Sa_immob for arbovirus molecular components set out in Table 4 should be obtained experimentally and the model outputs validated against competence data from insectary experiments as shown for Figs. 4 and 6. Parameterization of \u0394Ha_receptor and \u0394Sa_receptor for arboviruses as Fei et al. (2015) presented for AIV HA may be achieved in the near future and furthermore changes in \u0394Ha_receptor may be predictable from molecular data as described previously (Gale, 2018) particularly as more detailed information becomes available on arbovirus structure and Cr binding (Zhang et al., 2010). Due to the current paucity of Kd_receptor data for arboviruses, the models here are based on multiple integer GP/Cr contacts each of Kd_receptor = 10\u22123 M (37 \u00b0C) to represent a typical SA binding site on an arbovirus for the purpose of demonstration. That cell surface SA is important for BTV binding was demonstrated by the finding that blocking the SA on the cell surface reduced production of BTV in cell culture by \u223c20-fold (Zhang et al., 2010). The thermodynamic parameters used here in Table 4 are believed to be realistic and reassuringly the model outputs give good approximations to the experimental vector competence data (Figs. 4 and 6). It is also reassuring to note that the Ka of 3.5 \u00d7 1012 M\u22121 predicted for CHIKV binding to Ae. albopictus at 20 \u00b0C in the model (Table 4) is within two orders of magnitude of that of 2.2 \u00d7 1011 M\u22121 measured experimentally for the arbovirus WEEV binding to Cx. tarsalis BBFs at 20 \u00b0C (Houk et al., 1990). This offers some validation of the binding component of the model at least. For the kinetic component, while no data are available for pcomplete283, Scholtessik and Rott (1969) presented EA values for AIV RdRp of +83.7 kJ/mol and +150.6 kJ/mol, which are remarkably similar to the values of +105 kJ/mol and +270 kJ/mol used in the models (Table 4). In the absence of data for pcomplete283 the values used here in the kinetic component were chosen to give good approximations to the data in Figs. 4 and 6 to demonstrate proof of principle. The parameter pcompleteT is related to \u03bd in Turner et al. (2013) which is the rate at which latently-infected Culicoides midge vectors (i.e. those exposed to an effective BTV dose through feeding) become infectious and is the reciprocal of the EID in units of per day. Turner et al. (2013) calculate \u03bd for a given temperature T (in \u00b0C) using \u03bd = 0.0003T(T \u2013 10.4) from Mullens et al. (2004). In effect, \u03bd is the probability that the EIP is 1 day and at 11 \u00b0C for example has a value of 0.002 according to the equation of Mullens et al. (2004). The value of pcompleteT at 11 \u00b0C for CHIKV in Fig. 7 is very similar at 0.001, although pcompleteT is not in units of per day but is by definition the probability over the lifetime of the vector in the model here. Differences in pcomplete283 and EA at the biological level could represent the ability of virus to replicate in the midgut or salivary gland cells, for example, with the magnitude of EA representing how the efficiencies in these processes increase with temperature.",

(2002) report a huge \u0394Sa_virus of \u221216,062 J/mol/K which is consistent with a large \u0394Sa_immob in agreement with the theory for immobilization of the high molecular weight virion with its large moments of inertia, the models in Fig. 3a, d and e show that large numbers (n = 12 to 18) of GP/Cr contacts are required to overcome a \u0394Sa_immob of \u2212750 J/mol/K. This is irrespective of whether the GP/Cr binding is enthalpy driven, entropy-assisted or entropy-driven. There is no evidence that such large numbers of contacts occur during virus binding, most being estimated to be between 5 (Xiong et al., 2013) and 7 (Carneiro et al., 2002) contacts. Since using a \u0394Sa_immob of 0 J/mol/K gives more realistic results in terms of the number of GP/Cr contacts required, it is tempting to conclude that the contribution from \u0394Sa_immob to \u0394Sa_virus is small even for the results of Carneiro et al. (2002). For this reason, the arbovirus vector competence models in Figs. 4 and 6 are based on low values for \u0394Sa_immob (Table 4). Xiong et al. (2013) appear to assume \u0394Sa_immob is negligible by not considering it. Thus setting \u0394Sa_immob = 0 J/mol/K in Equation 17 expresses Ka as the reciprocal of Kd_receptor raised to the power of n as assumed by Xiong et al. (2013).",

It is interesting to note that only the CHIKV 2010\u20131909 strain showed decreased transmission efficiency at 28 \u00b0C compared to 20 \u00b0C for five of the six Ae. albopictus mosquito populations (Zouache et al., 2014). In contrast, CHIKV 06\u2013021 strain showed higher transmission efficiency at 28 \u00b0C compared to 20 \u00b0C for five of the six mosquito populations. This suggests the decreased transmission at higher temperature is a feature of the 2010\u20131909 strain and consistent which a property such as \u0394Sa_immob which is virus specific and independent of the host cell. However, \u0394Sa_immob alone was not sufficient to change vector competence from decreasing with temperature to increasing with temperature (Fig. 6), suggesting that the kinetic component is also important as is now discussed.",

            "text": "From Fig. 7 it can be seen that the temperature dependence of DENV transmission in Ae. albopictus is more influenced by the effect of temperature on the kinetic component than by the effect of temperature on C.VT. Indeed C.VT for DENV is relatively unaffected particularly at the lower temperatures because the 1000 midgut cells are almost fully saturated with virus with Ka > 1015 M\u22121 (Table 4). Thus DENV C.VT only starts to fall significantly at temperatures above 25 \u00b0C as Ka decreases well below 1014 M\u22121 (Fig. 7). In contrast for the CHIKV model, Ka is less than 1014 M\u22121 even at 10 \u00b0C (Table 4) and the midgut cells are not saturated. Thus CHIKV C.VT experiences the full effect of increasing temperature, but DENV does not in this model. This is solely due to the difference of 32 J/mol/K for \u0394Sa_immob which decreases the Ka for CHIKV to below 1014 M\u22121 such that Ka is 46-fold lower for CHIKV than for DENV at all temperatures (Table 4). In terms of overall impact of temperature on vector competence, the strongly-affected kinetic component due to the large value of EA for DENV dominates over the less affected C.VT and vector competence increases overall with temperature for DENV and for WNV (Fig. 4) which also has a large EA (Table 4). In contrast for CHIKV, the effect of temperature on the kinetic component is much weaker (Fig. 7) due to the smaller EA (Table 4) and there is a peak in the vector competence (Fig. 6) due to the opposing effects of temperature on C.VT and pcompleteT. Thus for CHIKV 2010\u20131909 in Brazilian Ae. albopictus, the strong effect of temperature on reducing C.VT wins at higher temperatures over the slowly increasing pcompleteT giving a peak followed by a decrease in transmission efficiency at temperatures above 18 \u00b0C (Fig. 6). The transmission probabilities for increasing competence for DENV and WNV in Fig. 4 would also peak, but at higher temperatures around 36 \u00b0C-38 \u00b0C as the vector/virus enzymes are denatured at 41 \u00b0C (Scholtessik and Rott, 1969) although some WNV strains vary in their temperature sensitivity (Kinney et al., 2006). This peak is not addressed here and arthropod temperatures are unlikely to exceed 35 \u00b0C particularly in northern Europe.",

            "text": "The results here show that information on whether GP/Cr binding is enthalpy-driven, entropy-assisted, or entropy-driven is important because it affects the temperature sensitivity of Ka (Fig. 3) and therefore C.VT (Fig. 5) and markedly influences the effect of temperature on arbovirus transmission efficiency particularly at lower temperature (Fig. 4c, d). Thus the increased virus/host cell binding affinity at lower temperature of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr contacts (Fig. 3a) greatly promotes transmission efficiency at lower temperatures giving a good fit to the data of Vogels et al. (2016) for WNV transmission by Cx. pipiens in Fig. 4c, d. In effect higher C.VT at lower temperatures with the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr binding (Fig. 5) compensates for the lower replication kinetic rates (Fig. 7) to some degree such that significant transmission can still occur at lower temperatures. For the entropy-assisted scenario, virus/host cell binding affinity (Fig. 3d) and C.VT (Fig. 5) are little affected by temperature such that the effect of temperature on vector transmission efficiency (Fig. 4c) is predominantly determined by the kinetic component (Equation 2). For entropy-driven GP/Cr binding, the decrease in C.VT with decreasing temperature (Fig. 5) together with the decreasing kinetic rate (Fig. 7), act synergistically to greatly diminish transmission efficiency and hence vector competence particularly at lower temperature compared to enthalpy-driven GP/Cr binding (Fig. 4d). Although not shown in the results here, decreasing the value of EA and increasing pcomplete283 in the kinetic component (Table 4) shifts the curve (dotted line in Fig. 4c) for entropy-driven GP/Cr binding back to the left giving a reasonable fit to the WNV data points of Vogels et al. (2016). However at 10 \u00b0C, the transmission efficiency predicted is only a third of that of the enthalpy-driven model (solid line in Fig. 4d). Thus there is a complex interplay between the thermodynamic scenario used for GP/Cr binding and the kinetic component that influences transmission efficiency at low temperatures.",

            "text": "The minimum temperature threshold is an important consideration for assessing the risks of BTV transmission by Culicoides midges in northern Europe. Carpenter et al. (2011) and Wittmann et al. (2002) specify minimum temperature thresholds of 11 to 13 \u00b0C for different orbiviruses in Culicoides midge species. Indeed the predicted EIP is infinitely long at a temperature of 10.4 \u00b0C according to the model of Mullens et al. (2004) such that transmission is zero at this temperature. The model here does not have a low temperature threshold because pcomplete283 is not zero (Table 4) and even with entropy-driven GP/Cr binding, the predicted transmission efficiency is not zero at 10 \u00b0C (dotted line Fig. 4d). At 10 \u00b0C the model for DENV in Ae. albopictus with n = 4 (or 5) enthalpy-driven GP/Cr contacts predicts a ptransmissionT of 0.0008 (solid line Fig. 4b), such that 1 in 1250 arthropods would transmit at this low temperature. Even with n = 3 GP/Cr contacts, the model predicts 1 in 15,300 arthropods would transmit at 10 \u00b0C (crosses, Fig. 4b). This absence of an absolute threshold predicted by the thermodynamic model here is entirely consistent with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for velocities of gas molecules which shows that a proportion of molecules have high kinetic energies even at lower temperatures, and also with the fact that at low temperatures adult arthropods live for longer, giving more time for virus replication to complete. This however does not take into account biomolecular mechanisms for a threshold which could include cold lability of proteins (i.e. some proteins denature at low temperatures) and also molecular phase transitions e.g. in phospholipid bilayers at lower temperatures (Gale and Watts, 1991). Thus lower lateral diffusion rates of Cr molecules within the plane of the membrane due to reduced fluidity of the phospholipid bilayer may restrict recruitment of a sufficient number of Cr molecules for high affinity virus binding. For this reason values of ptransmissionT may be much lower than suggested by the model here at lower temperatures. If there is molecular evidence that replication cannot occur below (or above) a certain temperature, then pcompleteT should be set to zero over those temperatures, and ptransmissionT will also equal zero according to Equation 7. In addition there are temperature-specific biological factors to consider including for example the effect of temperature on core inhibition of RdRp in the case of BTV (van Dijk and Huismans, 1982) and host immune responses (Foxman et al., 2015). These biological factors could mean that the change in magnitude of pcompleteT with temperature is not as straight forward as suggested by Equation 2.",

This is consistent with the data of Houk et al. (1990) for binding of 35S-labelled WEEV to mosquito BBFs. Thus the specific binding of WEEV decreased from 14% at 20 \u00b0C (at which binding was optimal) to just 3% at 40 \u00b0C for BBFs from susceptible Cx. tarsalis mosquitos. Fei et al. (2015) showed experimentally that the GP/Cr binding affinity for enthalpy-driven binding of AIV HA to SA glycans decreased by 10-fold over a 10 \u00b0C increase in temperature. Indeed results in Fig. 3b,c for AIV HA/sialyllactose binding suggest that AIV would not be very infectious at mammalian or avian body temperatures which is clearly not correct. The effect of temperature on Ka is potentially huge as demonstrated for VSV in Fig. 2. Paradoxically, this does not always relate to the observed effect of temperature on published virus infectivity data or even to all published virus binding data. Indeed the opposite is observed in some cases. Thus, Nunes-Correia et al. (1999) reported that the binding affinity of AIV H1N1 to canine kidney cells increased by over 10-fold from 4 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C. In the case of filovirus infectivity, Miller et al. (2016) demonstrated that at 72 h, titres of Ebola virus Makona and Marburg virus Angola were 1000-fold and 100-fold higher, respectively, at 41 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C in Rousettus aegyptiacus cell lines (although they were both similar at the 96 h end point). This is not consistent with a negative \u0394Ha_receptor for GP binding to Cr and indeed suggests a positive \u0394Ha_receptor as in entropy-driven binding (Fig. 3e, f and Fig. 5). Of course temperature kinetic effects on rates of viral macromolecule replication (Scholtessik and Rott, 1969) would also be important here (Fig. 7), but without efficient cell binding, infection would not initiate in the first place.",

            "text": "The work here identifies three thermodynamic/mechanistic reasons why strong virus binding and/or infectivity could still occur at high temperatures. First, increasing the number of GP/Cr contacts made on virus/cell binding by just one or two at higher temperature compensates the decrease in Ka due to temperature for enthalpy-driven GP/Cr binding (Fig. 3a). The impact on vector competence is shown in Fig. 4a with transmission efficiency increasing greatly at the higher temperatures as n is increased from 3 to 5. This mechanism requires n to increase with temperature as has been reported for HIV binding through increasing host membrane fluidity allowing effective recruitment of more Cr molecules to bind the virus (Harada et al., 2004) and is consistent with the observed increase in specific binding of WEEV to mosquito BBFs from 3% to 14% on increasing the temperature from 4 \u00b0C to 20 \u00b0C (Houk et al., 1990). The second is that GP/Cr binding is entropy-driven for some viruses as shown for HRV3 such that C.VT increases with temperature (Fig. 5). Alternatively the temperature sensitivity of binding can be eliminated through entropy-assisted binding as \u0394Ha_virus \u21920 kJ/mol (Fig. 3d and Fig. 5). The third (which applies to infectivity and not to binding affinity per se) is that the Ka values are >1015 M\u22121 over the biologically relevant temperature range (Fig. 2) such that changes in Ka, although large in magnitude, have no observed effect on C.VT and hence on infectivity. An example of how temperature-induced changes in Ka outside the biologically significant range of Ka have relatively little effect (over the low temperature range at least) on infectivity is apparent in the plot of C.VT as a function of temperature in Fig. 7 for DENV in Ae. albopictus.",

            "text": "In Fig. 2 it is shown how changes in \u0394Sa_virus of \u00b1500 J/mol/K are sufficient to select the temperature window over which Ka for VSV binding is either within or outside the biologically significant range of 106 to 1015 M\u22121. It is suggested here that through the \u0394SconfGP and \u0394SconfCr terms in Equation 10, the IDRs in the GP and Cr molecules (Fong et al., 2009, Dolan et al., 2015) could control \u0394Sa_receptor and \u0394Sa_virus and hence dictate the temperature range over which Ka is biologically significant. Thus, based on the estimated change in conformational entropy (\u0394\u0394Sconf) of \u223c 6.1 J/mol/K per amino acid residue in an IDR of a protein (Rajasekaran et al., 2016), \u201cadjusting\u201d \u0394Sa_virus by \u00b1500 J/mol/K would require a change in the order/disorder status of 82 amino acids in the VSV GP/Cr system. This is across seven VSV G proteins (Carneiro et al., 2002) and hence seven Cr molecules and would equate to \u223c12 amino acid residues per GP/Cr pair. IDRs in proteins may be up to 23 to 30 amino acid residues in length (Fong et al., 2009, Liu and Huang, 2014). Thus a change in the order/disorder status of 12 amino acid residues per GP/Cr pair would be quite feasible and across seven GP/Cr pairs involved in binding would be sufficient to change \u0394Sa_virus by \u00b1500 J/mol/K. VSV is an arbovirus and its life cycle involves horizontal transmission from insects to mammals (Za'arate and Novella, 2004). Using the \u0394Sa_virus value of \u221216,062 J/mol/K from Carneiro et al. (2002) predicts that VSV binds to phospholipid bilayers very strongly at arthropod temperatures (25 \u00b0C) but not at mammalian temperatures (37 \u00b0C) (Fig. 2). Strong binding at 37 \u00b0C is achieved with \u0394Sa_virus = \u221215,562 J/mol/K. Although speculative, it is suggested here that the order/disorder status of the IDRs of the VSV GP/mammalian cell Cr pair could shift \u0394Sa_virus by +500 J/mol/K such that VSV binds strongly at mammalian body temperature. Although outside the scope of the work here, some mechanism is needed to facilitate arbovirus binding to mammalian host cells which in the case of avian species for WNV could be at temperatures as high as 44 \u00b0C (Kinney et al., 2006) at which Ka would be greatly diminished compared to 25 \u00b0C, depending on the thermodynamics of GP/Cr binding.",

            "text": "A model for the effect of temperature on the transmission efficiency of an arbovirus by an arthropod vector is developed based on a simulated arthropod midgut and a thermodynamic/kinetic framework that naturally accommodates temperature. The model can explain both increasing and decreasing arbovirus transmission efficiency with temperature by allowing for the opposing effects of temperature on the affinity of virus binding (as defined by Ka) and on the rate of viral replication and spread to the salivary glands. The model is based on four thermodynamic/kinetic parameters, \u0394Ha_virus, \u0394Sa_virus, EA and pcomplete283, some of which may be measured experimentally in biochemical \u201ctest tube\u201d experiments, and it is anticipated, may ultimately be related to gene sequence data for the arbovirus and its arthropod vector. The thermodynamic nature of GP/Cr binding (i.e. enthalpy-driven, entropy-assisted or entropy-driven) influences the sensitivity of Ka, and hence vector competence, to temperature. GP/Cr binding for many viruses is enthalpy-driven and there is evidence for entropy-driven binding for at least one virus. Specifically enthalpy-driven GP/Cr binding promotes transmission efficiency at low temperature while entropy-driven GP/Cr binding diminishes transmission efficiency at low temperatures although there is no minimum temperature threshold according to the model. Enthalpy-driven binding, however, presents a paradox in that the stronger the binding at lower temperatures, then the weaker the binding at the higher temperatures at which virus replication rates are optimal. This may not necessarily result in lower infectivity at higher temperatures. Thus, according to the arthropod midgut model developed here, changes in Ka above 1015 M\u22121 have little effect on the number of midgut cells with bound virus hence masking the underlying effect of temperature on Ka. Furthermore higher temperatures may allow formation of more GP/Cr contacts which have a dominant effect (over the decrease in Ka with temperature for enthalpy-driven binding) on increasing Ka. According to the model increasing the number of enthalpy-driven GP/Cr contacts from three to five greatly increases transmission efficiency at the higher temperatures. Although entropy-assisted binding has not yet been documented for virus binding, it would minimize the effect of temperature on Ka. The potential role of the entropy of intrinsically disordered regions of GP and Cr in controlling the temperature sensitivity window of virus binding should be investigated in relation to binding at arthropod temperatures and the higher temperatures of the avian or mammalian host reservoirs. The thermodynamic approach developed here identifies the entropy of immobilization of the whole virus particle on binding to the host cell (\u0394Sa_immob) as a key parameter, the \u201crepulsive\u201d effects of which can be offset by increasing the number of GP/Cr contacts made. According to the model, even small differences in \u0394Sa_immob strongly influence the effect of temperature on the number of midgut cells with a bound virus and hence infectivity. It is anticipated that thermodynamic and kinetic data obtained from biochemical experiment and the interpretation of gene sequences could be applied to modelling the effect of temperature on arthropod vector competence through this model.",
