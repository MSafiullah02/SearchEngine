However, the techniques relying on indirect detection methods, i.e. turbidity and colorimetry, may not be able to distinguish between real and false positives under some unexpected cases when non-specific amplification occurs [19]. In this regard, the monitoring may be done by use of fluorescent dyes viz. SYBR Green I. In the presence of sufficient amount of double stranded DNA, the color of SYBR Green I turns from orange to green which is apparent under natural as well as ultraviolet light [19, 20] making it ideal for easy monitoring through naked eye. Furthermore, the employment of SYBR Green I lead to increased sensitivity when compared with visual turbidity measurements as per Zhang et al. [20] and Soli et al. [21].",

Although, the risk of contamination of amplicons may increase because of the need to open the reaction tubes to add the dye, however, opening the reaction tube after amplification with care to prevent carry-over contamination can be done to minimize the risk. On the other hand, agarose gel electrophoresis is a conventional method for monitoring the LAMP amplicons directly [13, 18, 19, 24], and even serves as a \u201cgold standard\u201d methodology in many situations. The results are interpreted as appearance of ladder-like banding in positive reaction tube under  ultra-violet (UV) gel imaging analysis system. However, ethidium bromide, used in gel electrophoresis, may act as mutagen, carcinogen, or teratogen, though this depends on the organism exposed and the circumstances of exposure [25]. Additionally, the method possesses a risk of cross-contamination and also relatively long turnaround times [26]. Also, the requirement for electrophoresis apparatus and UV detection limits the suitability for field applications.",
