            "text": "In the present review we discuss recent scientific discoveries of these long-misunderstood elements, previously considered to be junk DNA but which, in some instances, are now known to contribute to physiological functions (\u2018domesticated copies\u2019) 5, 6, 7 or to remain as dormant functional copies encoding retroviral proteins 5, 8, 9. We attempt to explain how these peculiar genetic elements may provide missing keys to understanding complex multifactorial diseases. The best-studied diseases where consistent scientific data support an involvement of HERV genetic elements in their pathogenesis are MS (Box 1\n) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but we also introduce chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). In addition, we discuss novel HERV-targeted therapeutic avenues that are starting to be evaluated in MS and ALS. Moreover, HERVs have also been associated with other diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [10], as well as with type 1 diabetes [11], but much less data are available for these disorders.Box 1Viruses in MSAn infectious origin of MS was suggested for the first time by Pierre Marie in 1884, but was rejected by the contemporary medical community. The evidence that viruses may contribute to MS comes from the accumulation of immune cells within the brain and CSF, local immune reactivity to specific viruses, and the presence of oligoclonal bands. MS epidemiology indicates some triggers during adolescence, an unusual geographic distribution (a gradient with latitude, but with exceptions: e.g., contrasting patterns in Sardinia and Japan), and epidemic clusters in previously isolated islands. Over time, several viruses have been proposed as causative agents of MS. From the 1940s onward they included rabies virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), scrapie prion, an unidentified MS-associated agent, parainfluenza virus 1, measles virus, simian virus 5, chimpanzee cytomegalovirus, coronavirus, EBV, an unidentified SMON-like virus (subacute myelo-opticoneuropathy virus), tick-borne encephalitis virus, HTLV-1, HSV-1, VZV, and HHV-6. The proposed mechanisms were direct brain or peripheral infection, activation of autoreactive T cells against nerve myelin, bystander activation, epitope spreading, molecular mimicry, and virus\u2013virus interactions. However, the link to MS was shown to be weak for the majority of the above viruses. The most consistent and independently confirmed studies for viral involvement in MS are for EBV. They appear to be confirmed, but only with indirect links, by history of infectious mononucleosis (IM; primary infection with EBV causes IM), and high anti-EBNA-1 (EBV nuclear antigen 1) IgG titers before MS onset. However, a new concept arose with the discovery that HERVs express pathogenic proteins in disease, and the best evidence of an association and pathogenic involvement is for HERV-W/MSRV (detected in MS blood, spinal fluid, and brain, in parallel with MS stages, active/remission phases, and therapy outcome). EBV is known to activate HERV-W/MSRV in vitro and in vivo (in IM patients and in healthy humans with high anti-EBNA1 IgG titers). This suggests that EBV could be an initial trigger, and that HERV-W/MSRV is a direct neuropathogenic contributor, before and during MS, in addition to its known contribution to promoting autoreactive T cells, immunoinflammation, and remyelination blockade.Alt-text: Box 1",

The ability of HERVs to become activated is linked to the chromatin state where a given copy is located [20]. DNA methylation and histone modifications are essential to the epigenetic control of human genes, including HERV elements. The prerequisite for functional transcription is that HERV sequences must retain functional long terminal repeats (LTRs), or become controlled by another promoter, without deletions or nucleotide substitutions that disrupt their open reading frames (ORFs). Because the nuclear microenvironment including the chromatin accessibility of coding regions differs between tissues, the baseline predisposition of a HERV copy to be activated can be tissue-, cell-, or maturation stage-specific.",

            "text": "After an initial study, which first presented evidence that herpesviruses might trigger HERVs in patients with MS as part of the retrovirus hypothesis for MS etiology [25], several teams showed that transcription of HERV genes and/or reverse transcriptase (RT) activity is increased in various human cells in vitro by Herpesviridae with tropism for nervous cell. This includes herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in lymphocytes from MS patients [26] and in neuronal or in brain endothelial cell lines [27]; varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in lymphocytes from MS patients [26]; cytomegalovirus (CMV) in kidney transplant recipients [28]; human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6) in lymphocytes from MS patients [26] and in T cell leukemic cell lines [29]; and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) in T cell lines [30] and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients as well as in astrocyte cell lines [31]. Many of these viruses have been implicated in MS (reviewed in [32]). Herpesviridae may invade brain parenchyma and induce local proinflammatory responses, but these pathogens are normally intercepted by perivascular macrophages (Figure 3\n). Macrophages are not permissive for their replication but may allow expression of HERV-transactivating Herpesviridae immediate-early genes [33]. The EBV gp350 protein has been shown to activate HERV-W in vitro in B cells and monocytes, but not in T cells, whereas monocyte/macrophage cells appear to be most susceptible [31]. Because EBV has also been shown to potently modify epigenetic traits of host cell DNA (reviewed in [34]), the reported association with infectious mononucleosis, in addition to the elevated anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1 IgG titers in patients with MS [35], might support the hypothesis that EBV acts as a priming trigger. However, this has not been directly demonstrated. Nevertheless, Herpesviridae (or other environmental activating factors) are now suggested to upregulate HERV-W expression, with its Env protein acting as a pathogenic effector in MS [36].",

Specifically, the HTLV-1 Tax transactivator potently increased the transcriptional activity of HERV-W, HERV-H, HERV-K, and HERV-E families in T cells [37]. Moreover, effects of HIV on HERV-K and on HERV-W in astrocyte cell lines and peripheral blood cells in vitro have been reported to be mediated by the HIV Tat protein, which can indirectly activate HERV-W through Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) along with TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB. Thus, by this pathway, HIV Tat could influence non HIV-infected cells [22]. This indirect mechanism suggests that the HIV-driven activation pathway requires persisting Tat stimulation for HERV activation. This differs from Herpesviridae in that self-sustained HERV expression may be induced following specific triggering events, which could explain the lifelong progression of MS and the multiple triggering events that are required before a pathogenic threshold leading to disease onset can be passed.",

Usually, T lymphocytes recognize their target antigen through a combination of variable domains in TCR chains that define the antigen-binding site of specific T cell clones. The interaction of these HERV Env proteins with another TCR region, which is known to be independent of the antigen-binding site and present on numerous T cells, is known to activate multiple clones irrespective of their antigen specificity. Molecules inducing such polyclonal activation are SAgs. An inflammatory loop also likely contributes to HERV pathogenicity: following initial priming and induction of specific HERV copies, macrophages and/or B cells produce HERV Env proteins that might fuel local innate inflammation and upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, causing further polyclonal activation of tissue-attracted T cells and therefore of B cells. This potential inflammatory loop could result in the development of devastating local lesions, while antigen-presenting cells stimulated via TLR and polyclonal activation of lymphocytes might promote breaks in immune tolerance that lead to autoimmunity, as was observed in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) treated with HERV-W Env protein [39].",

Histopathologically, MS is characterized by demyelinating lesions that predominantly expand in the white matter, causing destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes and leading to axonal disruption in the brain and spinal cord. Lesions spread to cortical regions, affecting grey matter and neurons. Active lesions also show blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, with infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes, whereas activated microglia represent the hallmark of regions within active and chronic lesions, where ongoing demyelination and axonal loss are now understood to cause functional impairment (reviewed in [40]).",

Retroviral sequences from RT-PCR with selected primers on particles produced by MS derived EBV-B lymphoblastoid cell lines identified sequence variants homologous to HERV-H elements (formerly named RTVL-H or RGH) [53]. Another study showed that B cells and monocytes from patients with active MS showed detectable surface expression of both HERV-H Env and HERV-W Env[54].

Subsequent studies over the following 25 years revealed that these particles originated from HERV elements, first termed MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV), whose sequences were determined from purified retrovirus-like particles isolated from MS cell culture supernatants 59, 60. The initial sequence identified from several MS isolates was obtained using a PCR protocol designed to detect unknown retroviral sequences flanked by conserved domains in most retroviral pol (polymerase) genes [61]. This prototype MSRV sequence identified a previously unknown HERV family, now named HERV-W because it uses a tryptophan (W) tRNA as a primer for reverse transcription, and that comprises multiple copies homologous to MSRV prototypic sequences 59, 62.",

Further investigations indicated that HERV protein expression is mainly restricted to macrophages and microglia, a minor proportion of lymphocytes, and to a few endothelial and astrocyte cells in active lesion areas 31, 63, 68, 69. HERV-W Env protein was similarly detected in MS lesions by using different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against different epitopes [64]. Its association with areas of active demyelination from active to chronic brain lesions, with fairly intense expression until the death of the patient, as seen post-mortem, suggests an involvement in the long-term pathogenic progression of the disease [69].",

Treatment of cultured primary oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) with HERV-W Env was shown to result in an overall reduction of oligodendroglial differentiation via activation of TLR4 [68]. OPCs contribute to neuroregeneration and myelin repair processes in the adult CNS, and blocking their differentiation by HERV-W Env protein may therefore result in remyelination failure (Figure 4\n). The negative impact on myelin synthesis in primary oligodendroglial cells could be rescued using a specific Env-neutralizing humanized immunoglobulin termed GNbAC1 [72]. Different mAb versions of GNbAC1 have been assessed on a small scale in MSRV Env-induced experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and these appeared to inhibit and somehow reverse EAE clinical evolution [73]. In addition, exposure of the HCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cell line to HERV-W Env was shown to impair endothelial cell physiology by boosting ICAM-1 expression (allowing T cell homing into tissues) and proinflammatory cytokine release via TLR4 activation, thereby suggesting that Env might affect BBB integrity (Figure 3) [74].",

This trial was a baseline-versus-treatment study with 20 patients with active RRMS defined as gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline. They were monitored for 3 months with monthly MRI and then treated with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir for 3 months. This trial did not reach its primary endpoint goal of significantly reducing either lesion count or lesion development during the treatment period versus baseline. Nonetheless, the tested drug is a known and effective inhibitor of HIV integrase which plays a role in chromosomal retrointegration of newly generated HIV DNA copies. Because this may not be a major aspect of HERV expression, and is unlikely to be a key issue for HERV Env production, the mode of action of this anti-HIV drug may not have had relevant effects on HERVs, thus explaining the negative results of the study.",

This investigation also showed TLR4-mediated effects of HERV-W Env protein on primary human Schwann cells. Such direct effects on Schwann cells, and the ability of HERV-W Env protein to cause tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity, make it an interesting potential new target for the treatment of patients with CIDP and HERV-W upregulation.

Expression levels of each gene correlated with each other, suggesting that an entire HERV-K genome is activated.

Some of the recently endogenized HERV-K elements have complete ORFs and can form complete viral particles [92]. These are probably recent insertions into the human genome because evolution has not yet introduced major deletions or mutations, and epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be responsible for HERV-K gene silencing, which may be overcome by environmental triggers.

These patients also showed expression of HERV-K in blood, the levels of which fell in all patients after the initiation of antiretroviral drugs [98]. As previously discussed in the context of HERV-W, it is possible that HIV proteins such as Tat may regulate the expression of HERV-K [99], and this could explain why the triggering pathways and expression feedback loops may differ in sporadic ALS that is not associated with HIV. It remains possible that anti-HIV drugs might indeed inhibit HERV-K, but that their efficacy is not as good as for HIV [95]. To further investigate the possibility that antiretroviral therapies might be of benefit in ALS, an open-label pilot study has been initiated in Australia and the UK. The trial is enrolling 40 patients with ALS, and will follow them for 3 months without treatment; then treat them for 6 months with triumeq \u2013 which includes two reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir and amivudine) that have been shown to effectively inhibit HERV-K reverse transcriptase activity in vitro, and an integrase inhibitor dolutegravir (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02868580).",

Although many issues remain unresolved (see Outstanding Questions), this scientific domain represents a rapidly evolving area of cutting-edge research (Box 2\n), and further studies may reveal that HERVs contribute to other complex and multifactorial human diseases. Therapeutic approaches targeting toxic HERV proteins or, more directly, HERV gene expression may thus create a change of paradigm with completely novel treatment perspectives. Finally, but not of the least interest, treatments targeting non-physiological HERV components would not dysregulate physiological functions and thus should have favorable safety profiles.Outstanding QuestionsHERVs are evolutionarily acquired, mostly defective and inactive, and comprise epigenetically silenced genetic elements without assigned physiological functions. However, for what reasons are they are maintained and represent 8% of the human genome?How are HERV dynamics in health and disease related to the transcriptional activity or protein expression, composition, or mutation of ancestral copies, as well as of unfixed non-ubiquitous copies?How can we best neutralize endogenous proteins such as those encoded by HERVs? Potential approaches include vaccination, antibody-mediated neutralization of pathogenic components, and antiretroviral compounds.What are the appropriate windows of opportunity for anti-HERV treatment? Can biomarkers be identified in peripheral blood that would permit routine assessment of HERV reactivation in CNS disease?\nBox 2Clinician\u2019s CornerThe involvement of HERV expression in MS and ALS provides a shift in paradigm not only for understanding their complex pathogenesis but also as for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat such diseases.Although positive results in the first therapeutic attempts to target these HERV elements or their pathogenic proteins would create an immediate breakthrough, the emerging domain of HERVs and human disease is likely to remain cutting-edge science for many years.The perspectives of future research in this domain at the frontiers of science are expected to unravel etiopathogenic cascades leading to many of the chronic, complex, and multifactorial diseases for which present knowledge remains obscure or partial, and where appropriate therapeutic approaches are not yet available.Alt-text: Box 2",

(A) DNA sequences representing remnants of mobile genetic machinery represent nearly 50% of the human genome. These are predominantly retrotransposons, that use RNA intermediates and a \u2018copy-paste\u2019 mechanism for retrointegration into chromosomes, and DNA transposons that use a \u2018cut and paste\u2019 mechanism; these represent 42% and 3% of the human genome, respectively [3]. Among retrotransposons, an important group is represented by the endogenous retroviruses (ERVs; HERVs for human ERVs) that entered the genome of species through infections of germline cells during evolution leading to subsequent endogenization \u2013 integration into the genome and presence in the DNA of every cell of the offspring [5]. About 8% of the human genome is constituted by HERV sequences; complete sequencing has revealed that intact coding sequences for functional HERV proteins represent <3%, if not 1% 101, 102. The remaining sequences comprise non-coding DNA, often within introns of \u2018classical\u2019 genes, with a potential role in generating non-coding RNAs [103].
