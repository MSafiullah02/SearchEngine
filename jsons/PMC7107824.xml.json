Then, on the basis of the final model selected, the area under the curve from the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the model's ability to discriminate between SARS and dengue. ORs and their 95% CIs were provided as estimates of the effect sizes. Those parameters identified as independent predictors by multivariate analysis were used for the predicted probability equation.

For patients without evidence of pneumonia at the initial evaluation, serial observations over time may be needed to identify those for whom isolation precautions can be discontinued safely [23]. Resolution of symptoms and lack of development of radiographic evidence of pneumonia by week 2 of illness argue against the diagnosis of SARS [17]. However, isolating all patients with fever of unknown origin over an extended period of time will overburden any health care system.

For the analysis, we elected to use a cutoff of <140 \u00d7 109 platelets/L for platelet count, because this was the cutoff used in a study of hematologic manifestations in patients with SARS [22], and this cutoff was also shown to be predictive in distinguishing dengue from other infectious diseases in Asia [12]. A WBC count of <5 \u00d7 109 cells/L has been reported to have a high positive predictive value for dengue fever in patients presenting with febrile illnesses [12, 24]. The cutoff of 34 IU/L for elevated AST level was based on the upper limit of the normal range in our laboratory. A model with the combination of these 3 parameters and using these cutoff values identifies dengue correctly in 75% (sensitivity of 75%) and rules out dengue in 100% (specificity of 100%) of cases. From a public health point of view, a specificity of 100% is desirable so that no case of SARS will be misdiagnosed as dengue, and thus, the patient not be isolated, leading to secondary transmission. With a sensitivity of 75%, still \u223c25% of patients with dengue will need to be isolated, until the results of dengue-specific tests become available.",

Lymphopenia is characteristic and of similar magnitude for both dengue and SARS. However, lymphopenia in dengue was also associated with depletion of total WBC count and neutrophil count, whereas for SARS, it was associated with normal total WBC count and normal-to-high neutrophil count. Neutrophilia in patients with SARS has been described in several case series but may be due to steroid treatment or secondary bacterial infection [15, 22]. This was not seen in our patients, most likely because the values were taken before the institution of any therapy. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase level is a predictor for poor prognosis in SARS [15], but the majority of patients with SARS admitted early in the course of disease had normal values. Although we did not have data for the cohort of patients with dengue, lactate dehydrogenase levels have been reported to be moderately elevated in patients with dengue [25]; therefore, this parameter is unlikely to discriminate between dengue and SARS.",
