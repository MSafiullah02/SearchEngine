While US and UK cases had plateaued near the peak number of cases but continued with large absolute numbers of new cases, Australia, had fewer than 20 new cases per day and had several 0 death days [8].Similarly, while R(t) was similar in Hungary and Argentina on May 8th, the trajectory of new cases was very different(Figure 2).",
