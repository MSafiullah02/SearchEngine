            "text": "Human infections by simian viruses represent increasing public health concerns. Indeed, by virtue of their genetic and physiological similarities, non-human primates (NHPs) are considered to be likely the sources of viruses that can infect humans and thus may pose a significant threat to human population. This is well illustrated by retroviruses, which have the ability to cross species, adapt to a new host and sometimes spread within this new species (Locatelli and Peeters, 2012). Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies have thus clearly showed that the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 in humans have resulted from several independent interspecies transmissions of different SIV types from Chimpanzees and African monkeys (including sooty mangabeys), respectively, probably during the first part of the last century (Aghokeng et al., 2006, Hahn et al., 2000, Plantier et al., 2009, Van Heuverswyn et al., 2006, Van Heuverswyn and Peeters, 2007). The situation for Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is, for certain aspects, quite comparable. Indeed, the origin of most HTLV-1 subtypes appears to be linked to interspecies transmission between STLV-1-infected monkeys and humans, followed by variable periods of evolution in the human host.

            "text": "The first STLV-3 strain (STLV-L/PH-969) was isolated in 1994, after co-culture of human cord blood lymphocytes with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from an Eritrean sacred baboon (Papio hamadryas) kept in captivity in a research laboratory in Leuven (Belgium) (Goubau et al., 1994). Sequencing of this virus, considered as the third lineage of the PTLV group and labeled thus as STLV-3, revealed a significant nucleotide divergence when compared to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 prototypical sequences (40% and 38%, respectively). From December 2001, a series of other STLV-3 strains were then described. Those strains were Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-amplified from the PBMCs of different monkey species, originating from West, Central and East Africa. Some of these STLV-3 viruses were present in wild-caught and/or wild-born animals living in Cameroon, Nigeria or Ethiopia, while other monkeys had been kept in captivity either in France in an ethological center, or in US zoos (Courgnaud et al., 2004, Meertens and Gessain, 2003, Meertens et al., 2002, Meertens et al., 2003, Takemura et al., 2002, Van Dooren et al., 2001, Van Dooren et al., 2004). Most STLV-3 serologies resembled an HTLV-2 pattern (gag-p24>gag-p19 and env-gp21 GD21, +/\u2212 env-gp46 K55) when determined with an HTLV-1/2 commercial western-blot assay (HTLV2-4 WB GenLabs) and/or with other assays (INNOLIA) (Courgnaud et al., 2004, Meertens and Gessain, 2003, Meertens et al., 2002, Van Dooren et al., 2004). Very few data are available on the epidemiological determinants (i.e., age, sex, modes of transmissions) of STLV-3 infection within infected non-human primates (NHP) as to date, most studies were performed in wild-caught monkeys (Courgnaud et al., 2004, Liegeois et al., 2008, Sintasath et al., 2009a, Sintasath et al., 2009b, Takemura et al., 2002). STLV-3 prevalence varies greatly according to the NHP species, the geographical location and the methodologies used for animals sampling (living monkeys kept as pets in villages, dead animals with bushmeat samples collection of blood or of dried blood spots), but STLV-3 infection has not been linked to any pathology so far. STLV-1 and STLV-3 can be found in the same primate species and even in the same animal (Courgnaud et al., 2004, Liegeois et al., 2008, Sintasath et al., 2009a). Based on partial or complete sequence analysis, STLV-3 lineage is now considered to be composed of four main subtypes (A\u2013D) that roughly correspond to the geographical source of the strains. Subtype A comprises strains from East Africa (Ethiopia and Eritrea), subtype B corresponds to strains from West and Central Africa, while the subtypes C and D comprise strains from Central Africa. Therefore, and although STLV-3 genome can be edited by double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (Ko et al., 2012), its variability remains low as it is the case for other PTLVs.",

These two viruses could not be isolated in culture, but the proviruses were PCR-amplified using a series of primers designed to amplify all known HTLVs and STLVs.

Phylogenetic studies indicated that HTLV-4 constituted clearly a monophyletic viral group and is considered as the oldest PTLV known-lineage (Switzer et al., 2009). Its sequence is equidistant from HTLV-1, HTLV-2 and HTLV-3, sharing only 62\u201371% nucleotide identity with them, respectively. Given previous epidemiological data on PTLV-1 and PTLV-3, it is likely that a monkey species is infected or has been infected with the simian counterpart of HTLV-4. However, despite screening of a large number of monkey species from Cameroon, Gabon and Democratic Republic of Congo, the search for such a virus has been unsuccessful up to now (Ahuka-Mundeke et al., 2012, Liegeois et al., 2012, Liegeois et al., 2008, Sintasath et al., 2009a, Sintasath et al., 2009b).",

            "text": "The prototype HTLV-4 proviral sequence (1863LE) is 8791-bp long (Switzer et al., 2009, Wolfe et al., 2005), while that of HTLV-3 (Pyl43) is 8553-bp long but contains a 366-bp deletion (Calattini et al., 2006a). Other HTLV-3 sequences are larger (8922-bp long for Lobak18, 8917-bp for 2026ND and 8913-bp for Cam2013AB) (Calattini et al., 2009, Switzer et al., 2006, Zheng et al., 2010). The overall HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 genomic organization is similar to that of other retroviruses with the presence of gag, pro, pol and env Open Reading Frames (ORF) encoding for structural and enzymatic proteins from non-spliced or singly-spliced mRNAs. As other HTLVs which belong to the complex retroviruses family, the provirus also contains additional ORFs: tax and rex on the sense strand and the Antisense Protein of HTLV-3 (APH-3) or of HTLV-4 (APH-4) ORFs on the antisense strand (Larocque et al., 2011) (\nFig. 1). The presence of additional ORFs that would encode for auxiliary proteins is the subject of current investigations (see below). HTLV-3/-4 proviral DNA sequence is flanked by two complete Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) sequences. Contrary to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 5\u2032LTR that contains three 21-bp repeats sequences (also name Tax Responsive Elements), HTLV-3/-4 5\u2032LTRs contain two of those motifs (Calattini et al., 2006a, Switzer et al., 2006, Switzer et al., 2009). They correspond to transcription factor binding sites, where the RNA PolymeraseII complex will be recruited through Tax interaction. A c-Myb binding site is also present in HTLV-4 5\u2032LTR (Switzer et al., 2009). HTLV-3/-4 3\u2032LTRs also contain a promoter whose regulation is currently unknown and that allows transcription of aph-3/4 mRNAs (Larocque et al., 2011).",

As HTLV-1/-2, which, in addition to dendritic cells, infect activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively in vivo, we have shown that HTLV-3 surface envelope glycoprotein (gp46 or SU) binds to both activated CD4+ and CD8+ T, but also to na\u00efve CD4+ T cells (Jones et al., 2009). The latter do not bind HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 SU and do not express detectable levels of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) and Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1). A series of experiments also demonstrated that GLUT-1 serves at a post-binding step factor for HTLV-3. These results indicate that the complex of molecules used by HTLV-3 to bind and enter into CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in vitro differs from that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (\nFig. 2). Ongoing experiments are currently being performed using blood samples from STLV-3 infected animals and should allow the determination of PTLV-3 tropism in vivo in non-human primate cells.",

Tax-3 sequence shares a number of key similarities with Tax-1, including the presence of a putative Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), a functional CBP/p300 binding domain, a Nuclear Export Signal, a CR2 binding domain and a PDZ binding motif (PBM) (Chevalier et al., 2006). Importantly, this latter sequence is critical for the ability of the Tax-1 protein to transform cells in vitro.

In silico analyses suggest that APH-3 and APH-4 are more closely related to APH-2 than to HBZ (Larocque et al., 2011). However, in transfected cells, both proteins are localized into the cell nucleus and nucleolus, APH-3 being also partially detected in the cytoplasm (Larocque et al., 2011). Surprisingly, this localization is more similar to that of HBZ than to APH-2. As their HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 counterparts, both APH-3 and APH-4 repress transcription from the HTLV-1 5\u2032LTR (Larocque et al., 2011).

The prevalence of FVs in naturally infected animals is generally high, but can vary widely according to species and environmental conditions. Several epidemiological studies indicated that, among captive NHP populations (Blewett et al., 2000, Calattini et al., 2004, Hussain et al., 2003, Schweizer et al., 1999, Schweizer et al., 1995), but also in free-range colonies (Calattini et al., 2006c, Mouinga-Ondeme et al., 2010) and in the wild (Jones-Engel et al., 2005, Leendertz et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2008), SFV seroprevalence can reach up to 75\u2013100% in adults, but is generally much lower in infants and juveniles (Liu et al., 2008). SFV virions are present at a high concentration in the saliva of infected NHPs (from 104 to 109 FV RNA copies/104 cells equivalent). In African green monkey and macaques NHPs, oral mucosa tissue is indeed an important site for viral replication (Falcone et al., 1999, Murray et al., 2008, Murray et al., 2006). These results, as well as epidemiological studies and long-term behavioral observations, strongly suggest a saliva-based means of transmission such as bites, licking, and mucosal splashes (Calattini et al., 2006c, Leendertz et al., 2010).

Recent phylogenetic studies demonstrated that this virus originated from the East African chimpanzee subspecies (Pan t. Schweinfurtii). This virus has now been renamed as the \u201cprototype foamy virus\u201d, PFV. However, it remains unclear whether this first \u201chuman\u201d foamy isolate arose from an in vivo cross-species transmission from a chimpanzee to the African carrier, or if it originated from a cell culture contamination.",

Results were contrasted. Whereas several serological studies provided evidence for FV in different populations, other groups mainly found negative results. (reviewed in (Meiering and Linial, 2001)). Such discrepancies reflected the high percentage of non-specific serological reactivities and the lack of specific confirmatory test at that time. Indeed, when SFV-specific serological (western blot (WB), radio-immunoprecipitation (RIPA), specific IF) and molecular assays (PCR) were available, most of the positive results obtained previously in different human populations, as well as in several series of patients (neurological disorders, cancers, thyroiditis, inflammatory diseases), were not confirmed (Meiering and Linial, 2001).",

After these initial studies, a Center for Diseases Control (CDC) team demonstrated that, some workers occupationally exposed to NHPs were SFV infected (Heneine et al., 1998). Another study demonstrated the presence of SFV infection in workers from a primate facility in Canada (Brooks et al., 2002). Interestingly, among 187 persons occupationally exposed to NHPs from the large CDC cohort, SFV infection was found to be much more frequent (3.4%) than infection by other simian retroviruses such as SIV (0.06%), STLV (0%) or simian type D retrovirus (0.5%) (Switzer et al., 2004). Such transmission in personnel from zoos or primate centers was also recently demonstrated in Gabon and in China (Huang et al., 2012, Mouinga-Ondeme et al., 2010) (Table 1).",

While 10 out of 1099 (1%) individuals from Cameroon, had antibodies to SFVs, only 3 out of these 10 seropositive persons had detectable SFV sequences in the DNA extracted from their PBMCs (\nTable 2).

We demonstrated the presence of SFV infection in more than 50 persons (Bantus or Pygmies), the great majority of them being hunters having been bitten by an ape (mostly gorilla but also chimpanzee) or a small monkey (mostly C. nictitans) during hunting activities (Betsem et al., 2011, Calattini et al., 2007).

Once produced, the Tas transactivator activates the internal promoter (IP), giving rise to a positive feedback loop (Kang et al., 1998). When sufficient amount of Tas is produced, it can also bind to specific elements in the LTR promoter, with a lower affinity than for the IP. Activation of the LTR, which remains otherwise silent, induces the expression of the Gag, Pol and Env structural proteins, ultimately leading to the formation of viral progeny (reviewed in (Rethwilm, 2010)).

However, some cell lines as well as primary cells of the myeloid or lymphoid lineage can also remain chronically infected (Mikovits et al., 1996, Yu et al., 1996c).

            "text": "However, when looking at FV polymorphism in viruses present in human PBMCs (5 individuals), we did not find striking differences between those viruses and that present in NHPs, suggesting that, even decades after primary infection, FV genomes are still fully replicative (Rua et al., 2012a). This raises the question of their apparent restriction in humans which might thus be linked to their immune control. In vitro, FVs are sensed by human hematopoietic cells and induce the production of the antiviral cytokines IFN-I (Rua et al., 2012b). In culture systems, the addition of type I IFN (Regad et al., 2001, Rhodes-Feuillette et al., 1990, Sabile et al., 1996), or the expression of various IFN-stimulated genes, including APOBEC3 and tetherin, impair FV replication (Delebecque et al., 2006, Dietrich et al., 2011, Lochelt et al., 2005, Perkovic et al., 2009, Russell et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2011). It is tempting to speculate that the type I IFN response is in large part responsible for the control of viral replication in infected individuals. In line with these in vitro studies, it was reported once that FV genomes found in humans displayed few G to A mutations, as if they were partially sensitive to the action of the APOBEC3G restriction factors, which are induced by IFN-I (Delebecque et al., 2006). In addition, neutralizing antibodies are known to inhibit SFV transmission and infection in rhesus macaques (Williams and Khan, 2010), indicating that the adaptive immune response may control further the virus in vivo. Studies are thus needed to understand the role of the adaptative immune system in FV restriction in humans.",

            "text": "The recent discovery of HTLV-3/4 and foamy retroviruses in humans raises important questions, still unanswered, concerning different aspects of the natural history of these retroviruses (\nFig. 5).1)The first question concerns the magnitude and the distribution of these viruses in humans living in areas that are highly endemic for infected non-human primates.Concerning foamy viruses, around 100 persons have already been convincingly reported as infected by SFV (Table 1, Table 2). Most of them are living in central Africa, especially in villages or settlements located in the forest area of Cameroon and Gabon. In most cases, infected persons are men who reported a close contact, especially a bite from a NHP during hunting activities (\nFig. 6). However, in few cases including some women, the exact origin of the infecting contact remains yet unknown (Betsem et al., 2011, Calattini et al., 2007, Wolfe et al., 2004). This suggests the possibility of viral transmission during handling, processing, or food preparation tasks, of possibly infected NHP game. These tasks are frequently performed by women. Future studies are also necessary to define SFV prevalence in humans living in other areas of Africa. In Asia, even if the situation is less known, presence of SFV have already been clearly reported in some persons (Huang et al., 2012, Jones-Engel et al., 2005, Jones-Engel et al., 2008). Furthermore, contacts between persons and NHPs are in Asia common (Jones-Engel et al., 2006). Thus, SFV infections in humans are likely to be very prevalent among persons who live or work near NHPs.Concerning HTLV-3 and HTLV-4, the only data available so far were obtained from a series of a few thousand individuals mostly living in south Cameroon (Calattini et al., 2009, Calattini et al., 2011, Calattini et al., 2005, Wolfe et al., 2005, Zheng et al., 2010), an area where STLV-3 strains are endemic in several monkey species. One could however hypothesize that HTLV-3/4 viruses are also present (probably at a low prevalence) in other populations living in other countries of West, Central and East Africa. Indeed, in such regions; (i) HTLV indeterminate Western blot serologies are frequent, including some patterns that are quite similar to those found in HTLV-3 infected persons and (ii) STLV-3 strains have been reported to be endemic in several monkey species from West (Meertens and Gessain, 2003), Central (Liegeois et al., 2008, Meertens et al., 2003), and East Africa (Takemura et al., 2002, Van Dooren et al., 2004). However, studies specifically aimed at detecting HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 in such countries have not been published. We should also keep in mind the very peculiar epidemiology of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, with the presence of high endemic foci, often located nearby large regions with a low prevalence. This has been well exemplified recently in South Cameroon for HTLV-2. Indeed, in this large area, HTLV-2 is nearly absent, except in the Bakola's Pygmy population (Mauclere et al., 2011). Such situation which is very probably linked to a founder effect followed by favorable viral transmission in a given community, may also happen for HTLV-3 or -4 infections.2)The second question concerns the possibility of inter-human transmission of those retroviruses.Based on available data, SFV transmission among humans has not been yet demonstrated. Indeed, only around 40 family members (mostly spouses) of men infected by SFV have been studied and scored negative (Betsem et al., 2011, Callahan et al., 1999, Heneine et al., 1998, Switzer et al., 2004; Boneva et al., 2007) suggesting that SFV transmission does not occur frequently through sexual contacts or saliva exposure. The persistence of infectious virus in PBMCs, and the identification of infected blood donor (CDC study conducted in North America (Boneva et al., 2002)) had raised safety concerns regarding a potential viral transmission through blood transfusion. These concerns are supported by recent studies demonstrating that SFV can be transmitted in macaques through blood transfusion of an infected donor animal ((Khan and Kumar, 2006) and reviewed in (Khan, 2009)). Studies are ongoing to search for SFV replication sites in infected humans (Rua et al., unpublished data).The HTLV-3/4 situation is probably different. Even if these viruses originally arose through interspecies transmission from STLV-3/4 infected monkeys to humans, it is difficult to speculate on the relative part of the direct acquisition from infected monkeys versus the acquisition from other infected humans through sexual activity or breast-feeding. Most HTLV-1/2 infected individuals living in central Africa were very probably infected through human contacts and not through NHPs interspecies transmission. Familial studies on larger series of HTLV-3/4 infected studies are thus required to determine whether those viruses can be transmitted from humans to humans.3)The third question concerns their possible associated morbidity and mortality in humans.Concerning SFVs, their apparent lack of pathogenicity in humans is based on studies conducted on a very limited number of cases with a short follow-up (Boneva et al., 2007), and contrasts with the massive in vitro lytic properties of these viruses both in monkeys and in human cells. The selection bias inherent to the enrolment of mostly healthy persons, in the few published series limits greatly the ability to identify any potential acute and/or severe associated diseases. Ongoing case-control study, based on a larger number of SFV-infected persons is therefore necessary to shed light on any possible chronic diseases and/or biological abnormalities associated to SFV infection in humans. However, we have to keep in mind that, as for all the diseases associated with HTLV-1, incidence of disease in an SFV infected person might be very low and may follow very long latency periods. Thus, more data are absolutely needed before SFV can be classified as a non-pathogenic virus in humans.Regarding HTLV-3/4, the situation is even more complex, since only 5 cases (4 HTLV-3 and one HTLV-4) have only been reported (Calattini et al., 2009, Calattini et al., 2011, Calattini et al., 2005, Wolfe et al., 2005, Zheng et al., 2010).Questions regarding any possible chronic/acute disease and/or biological abnormality in humans are similar to SFVs with the necessity of a case-control study based on larger numbers of HTLV-3/4 positive individuals, with a long term follow-up. Regarding viral tropism and pathogenicity of STLV-3, colonies of infected STLV-3 NHP are already available and might allow to answer to these questions. Alternatively, the use of other animal models such as humanized-mice might also allow us to determine the pathogenicity of those viruses.\n",

Some of them were even quite specialized in such hunting activities as all the Hunter-gatherer groups, including several Pygmies tribes living in Central Africa. In most cases, bushmeat hunting and related-activities (butcher, smoked meat, selling, consumption, pets,..) were quite restricted to remote areas with mostly local meat consumption. The situation has greatly changed during the last decades due to several factors. As an example, there has been a tremendous increase of hunting activities, resulting from a combination of urban demand for bushmeat, greater access to NHP habitats provided in part by logging roads, easier accessibility to fire arms, and an increase in populations living in forest areas, as well as the associated increase in local food needs. Growing urban populations, expansion of logging industries and oil and mining companies and even in some cases, armed conflicts have also contributed at different levels to the increase of bushmeat trade. Interestingly, in a study conducted in South Cameroon, most SFV-infected persons were relatively young and have acquired the virus during the last 20 years indicating that such cross-species transmission is still ongoing (Betsem et al., 2011). Today, between 3 and 5 million tons of bushmeat are eaten each year (with around 15% originating from NHPs) in Central Africa. There is an evident lack of economic options of affordable substitutes. Indeed, bushmeat is around 75% cheaper than domestic meat (Coad et al., 2010, Karesh and Noble, 2009, Macdonald et al., 2011, Wolfe, 2005).",

Indeed, HIV is now endemic in many African countries at a relatively high level in rural and urban adult populations that are now at risk for retroviral (STLV, SFV, SIV) cross-species transmissions. Such co-infections are very likely to occur in Central African populations where HIV-1 is endemic and were in fact already reported (Switzer et al., 2008). The outcome of an HTLV-3/4 or SFV infection in an immunosuppressed person is unknown. However, one may expect that such co-infection may modify (pro)viral load and/or tissue distribution (as shown for macaques co-infected with SIV and SFV for instance (Murray et al., 2006)) and thus possibly viral transmission and pathogenicity in the infected person.",

This is totally different to the situation with the other human retroviruses of zoonotic origin as HIV-1 and HTLV-1, which have became largely epidemic and endemic, respectively.",
