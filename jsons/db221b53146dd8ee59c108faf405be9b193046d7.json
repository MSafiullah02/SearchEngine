The S protein is involved in receptor recognition and carries distinct functional domains near its amino (S1) and carboxy (S2) termini, while the N-terminal S1 domains recognize sugar receptors, and the S2 subunit is a transmembrane protein that mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion during cell invasion (Fang Li, 2016) . S1 and S2 contain several antigenic domains, but S1 appears to be the most efficient at inducing antibodies with high neutralizing activities in its host (Yoo & Deregt, 2001) . The HE protein contains two important functional domains: the lectin domain and the esterase domain.",

The receptor-binding (lectin) and receptor-destroying (esterase) domains may be important for virus entry (Kienzle, Abraham, Hogue, & Brian, 1990; Schultze, Wahn, Klenk, & Herrler, 1991) . Therefore, in addition to the S protein, the HE protein serves as a second viral attachment protein for infection initiation (Groot, 2006) . The primary role of BCoV N protein is to package the viral genome into long, flexible, helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, protect the genome and ensure its timely replication and reliable transmission, as well as playing a role in viral transcription and translation (Hurst, Ye, Goebel, Jayaraman, & Masters, 2010) .",

            "text": "The high genetic diversity in coronaviruses is attributable to the high mutation rates associated with RNA replication, the high recombination frequencies within the coronavirus family and the large coronavirus genomes (Woo, Lau, Huang, & Yuen, 2009 ). Recombination in coronaviruses plays an important role in virus evolution and can result in the emergence of new pathotypes (Menachery, Graham, & Baric, 2017; Wang et al., 2015) as well as changing the host ranges and ecological niches (Bakkers et al., 2017) . Thus far, recombination regions in coronaviruses have been extensively reported for the S gene (Kin et al., 2015; Lau et al., 2011; Minami et al., 2016) , a finding also applicable to BCoV (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2012) . Recombination events in M (Herrewegh, Smeenk, Horzinek, Rottier, & Groot, 1998 ), N (Kin et al., 2015 , RP3 (Lau et al., 2010) and the ORF1 gene (Chen et al., 2017; Kin et al., 2015) have also been reported. However, to date, recombination events in HE have only been reported in MHV, a betacoronavirus, and this situation may act as a strong force for generating strains with new genotypes, host spectra and tissue tropisms (Groot, 2006; Luytjes, Bredenbeek, Noten, Horzinek, & Spaan, 1988; Smits et al., 2005) .",

Therefore, in this study, we screened 190 diarrhoea faecal samples from calves, 36 of which were found to be BCoV-positive, and the positive samples were distributed across 13 of the 14 farms we screened across six provinces in the major dairy cattle production areas of China. The results showed that BCoV is circulating widely in these dairy cattle, a finding that should help with the diagnosis and control of diarrhoea in these animals.

Recombination events between the esterase and lectin domain of HE were identified as occurring at remarkably high frequencies, and these recombinant strains are widely prevalent in dairy cattle in China. As far as we F I G U R E 6 Phylogenetic tree based on the deduced 448 aa sequences of the complete N gene. Sequence alignments and clustering were performed by ClustalW in MEGA 7.0 software. The tree was constructed by the maximum-likelihood method with bootstrap values calculated for 1,000 replicates. The strains in this study were marked with a circle, and the other Chinese BCoV strains were marked with a triangle are aware, this is the first description of a recombination event in the HE gene of BCoV, and our findings will enhance current understanding about the genetic evolution of BCoV. F I G U R E 7 Phylogenetic tree based on the deduced 230 aa sequences of the complete M gene. Sequence alignments and clustering were performed by ClustalW in MEGA 7.0 software. The tree was constructed by the maximumlikelihood method with bootstrap values calculated for 1,000 replicates.

The most common betacoronavirus HE receptor is 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia; Matrosovich, Herrler, & Klenk, 2013). However, the MHV-S receptor is 4-O-Ac-Sia, not 9-O-Ac-Sia, and this change may be caused by aa substitutions and/or insertions in the receptor-binding region of the HE lectin domain, as compared with the Mebus BCoV prototype strain (Langereis et al., 2012). The HE protein lectin domain recognizes the sugar receptor, and the R2-loop in the lectin domain (residues 176-185) plays an important role in ligand binding; aa substitutions in this region may reduce receptor-binding activity (Bakkers et al., 2017).
