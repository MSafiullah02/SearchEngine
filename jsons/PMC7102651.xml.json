The model suggested that at least one or more of the predictors had a significant relationship with the student\u2019s levels of anxiety [F(8165) = 12.71, <0.001]. The student's improvised hygienic habits score correlated significantly with the student\u2019s reported level. Also, the students reported social avoidance score converged significantly with the students reported anxiety score when considering all other variables jointly. Those were followed by the GAD score, which shows significant correlation with the student\u2019s reported anxiety from the MERS-CoV when all the other variables were controlled.",
