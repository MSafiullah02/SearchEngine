Immediately after brain injury, proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) as well as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) are produced in large volume. These worsen the condition of trauma and delay the recovery by producing oxidative stress and matrix metalloproteinases [13, 14]. These post-traumatic inflammatory cascades cause blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, which ultimately leads to the influx of inflammatory cells from the blood to the brain [15]. Production of reactive oxygen substrates (ROS) directly or indirectly, as oxidative by-products of lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids are common following traumatic brain injury. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the major by-products of lipid peroxidation. MDA is potentially an atherogenic lipid peroxide and generated in vivo via peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids [16].",

Early nutrition support in TBI patients results in a significant reduction in mortality rate, less infectious complications, and lower risk of poor outcome [18]. There has been a growing use of immunonutrition to modulate the inflammatory response in injury or infection and to improve clinical outcomes [19]. Immune-modulation enteral formula has been proven to significantly reduce infection rate in TBI patients [20]. One of the ingredients that can be used in an immunonutrition formula to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress is pycnogenol.",

It is classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) in the USA [22]. Clinical effects of PYC include endothelium-dependent vasodilator activity [23] and anti-thrombotic effect as shown by numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations in animals and human clinical research studies [21, 24]. PYC prevents neurotoxicity and apoptotic cell death in oxidative stress status [25, 26]. Also, PYC protects against lipid peroxidation and pro-oxidants and peroxynitrites [27, 28]. A number of animal studies have proven the protective effect of PYC following traumatic brain injury by suppressing IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels [29, 30]. No serious adverse effects have been seen in any clinical trials or commercial use [31]. The most commonly observed adverse effect is gastric discomfort due to its mild and transient nature [22].",
