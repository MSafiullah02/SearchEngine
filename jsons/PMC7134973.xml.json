This reduction in the amount of RNA used is due to the fact that commercial kits use purified RNA, whereas we use matrix-contaminated RNA. In this case it is common practice to reduce the amount of material used in order to avoid inhibition. We noticed that while the MEP method perfectly performs with standard samples a delay of crossing point (CP) values is observed with samples contaminated with hemoglobin.",

At this number of cycles an increase of the fluorescence signal of the first dilution stage (1:10) could be measured when using the commercial kits.
