However, failure of the immune system due to illness and/or the use of immunosupressors and other therapeutic drugs can increase the patient's susceptibility to infections. Moreover, the use of antibiotics can inadvertently select antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. 21 Since the environment serves as an important reservoir for infectious organisms, the control of hospital infections is a matter of great concern and a major challenge. The introduction of optimized disinfection products and processes is critical to control and prevent the spread of nosocomial infections, cross-resistance and persister cells. 24 Within recent decades, requirements regarding the antimicrobial activity of disinfectants in the medical field have been defined in various European standards. 25 Also, guidelines have been developed by the CDC, which recommend hospitals to thoroughly clean and disinfect environmental and medical equipment surfaces on a regular basis. 26 However, there is a variety of products available on the market with moderate or even insufficient antimicrobial action. 25 New products and technologies with 'permanent' antimicrobial activity without the risk of generating resistant microorganisms are needed. 12 Hence, this manuscript provides information on the main pathogens causing HAI and the relevant in-use and emergent strategies for their control.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 171, "text": "9 -12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 421, "end": 427, "text": "13 -18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 584, "end": 586, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 884, "end": 895, "text": "1,11,20 -23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1334, "text": "21", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1681, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1844, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2019, "end": 2021, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2145, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2286, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The increase in HAI is associated with the higher capacity of bacteria to resist and adapt to harsh environmental conditions, including the presence of antimicrobial agents.

Thus, antimicrobial therapies fail to kill biofilms most of the time. 27 -30 Furthermore, there are few prevention techniques to control biofilm formation without causing side effects. 31 Some of the most important pathogens involved in HAIs include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE), Acinetobacter baumannii and some Enterobacteriaceae strains. 1, 21, 32, 33 To a lesser extent, pathogens such as Candida species, viruses [adenoviruses, noroviruses, rotaviruses, influenza, parainfluenza, hepatitis B viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronaviruses] can also survive on surfaces and medical equipment, although there is little evidence of possible survival. 2,32 -34 Most of these pathogens can survive for months on surfaces. 32, 35 Some examples of the most persistent hospital pathogens are summarized in Table 1 along with some of their characteristics. Some investigations have proposed that Gram-negative bacteria persist longer than Gram-positive bacteria and, although it has been suggested that the type of surface does not influence the period of persistence, it has also been shown that longer persistence may occur on plastic or even on steel. 32, 36 In terms of environmental conditions, lower temperatures (4 -68C) and high humidity (.70%) improved the persistence of several bacteria, fungi and viruses. 32 Moreover, the frequency of contamination has been shown to vary depending on the body sites at which patients are colonized or infected.

Drees et al. 41 demonstrated an increase in VRE infection risk for an occupant of a room where a patient with this infection was previously treated.

Medical devices, including stethoscopes and otoscopes, are highly prone to be contaminated with bacteria and have been implicated as potential vectors of cross-transmission. 46 Moreover, bacteria were found on various plastic items in the hospital, including pagers and cell phones. 47 Cotterill et al. 48 provided suggestive evidence that contaminated ventilation grills were sources of MRSA outbreaks in hospitals. Additionally, an estimated 20% -40% of HAIs have been attributed to cross-infection via the hands of healthcare personnel, who have become contaminated from direct contact with the patient or indirectly by touching contaminated environmental surfaces. 15, 38 In fact, hand hygiene is a major contributing factor to the current infection threats to hospital inpatients. 49 Barker et al. 50 showed that norovirus is consistently transferred via the fingers to melamine surfaces and from there to other typical hand-contact surfaces, such as taps, door handles and telephone receivers. Pessoa-Silva et al. 51 demonstrated that hands become increasingly contaminated with commensal flora and potential pathogens during neonatal care and that gloves do not fully protect the workers' hands from contamination. Pittet et al. 52 concluded that bacterial contamination increased linearly with time on ungloved hands during patient care. This demonstrates the importance of decontaminating hands before every patient contact. Fendler et al. 53 concluded that the use of an alcohol gel hand sanitizer decreased infection rates during a 34 month period and can provide an additional tool for an effective infection control programme. The same conclusion was reached by Hilburn et al. 54 The gloves of medical staff are also easily infected from direct contact with an infected patient or, indirectly, by touching contaminated surfaces, which serve as a carrier for pathogenic microorganisms. 11 In a study focused on MRSA infection, 42% of personnel gloves that contacted the furniture/surfaces of a patient room but had no direct contact with infected patients were contaminated. 37, 44 More significantly, it was found that 65% of the nursing staff that had directly treated an infected individual contaminated their gowns/uniforms with the organism. 55 The white coats, shirts and ties of doctors have also been found to contain potentially pathogenic flora. 56 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 183, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 400, "end": 402, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 403, "end": 406, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 407, "end": 410, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 411, "end": 413, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 428, "end": 430, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 721, "end": 723, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 830, "end": 832, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 850, "end": 852, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1219, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1222, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1335, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1352, "text": "Barker et al. 50", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1569, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1785, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 1998, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2237, "end": 2239, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2445, "end": 2447, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2634, "end": 2637, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2638, "end": 2640, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2806, "end": 2808, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2915, "end": 2917, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influence of clinical environment on HAI propagation"}, {"text": "Maintenance of a good hospital environment requires the implementation of adequate strategies.

Alcohols such as ethanol have a long history of antiseptic use; around the 19th and 20th centuries phenolics and hypochlorites started to be employed and, later, quaternary ammonium compounds. 66 More recently, the most common products have been chlorhexidine and silver salts, peroxygens, glutaraldehyde and ortho-phthalaldehyde. 66, 67 Alcohol disinfectants cause protein denaturation and are effective against vegetative bacteria, fungi and viruses, but have no effect on spores. 61, 68 Chlorine-releasing agents can oxidize membrane proteins and are very effective in removing biofilms from surfaces, requiring short exposure times for growth inhibition. 57, 61, 68 However, these chemical agents are corrosive to metals and can be inactivated by the presence of organic matter. 57, 61, 69 Moreover, in the last few years the use of chlorine has been associated with the formation of carcinogenic compounds and some pathogens have been shown to be resistant to chlorine. 70 The aldehyde-based disinfectants disrupt proteins and nucleic acids by alkylation and have antimicrobial activity against spores, bacteria, viruses and fungi. 61, 64 Quaternary ammonium compounds and phenols solubilize the membrane and the cell wall. 68 Hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid promote protein denaturation, and are active against several groups of microorganisms and pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections. 38, 57, 61, 64 The mechanism of action of different disinfectant categories has been presented elsewhere in greater detail. 64, 71, 72 Countless studies have been performed regarding the antimicrobial action and efficacy of different disinfectants. Rutala and Weber 69 reviewed the use of inorganic hypochlorite (bleach) in healthcare facilities for disinfection of medical devices and environmental surfaces, and concluded that the many advantages of chlorine (e.g. fast microbiocidal activity, cost-effectiveness and good track record) are likely to support its continued use in healthcare settings. Griffiths et al. 73 evaluated the efficacy of several disinfectants (sodium dichloroisocyanurate, chlorine dioxide, 70% industrial methylated spirits, 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde, 10% succinedialdehyde and formaldehyde mixture, 0.35% peracetic acid and a peroxygen compound at 1% and 3%) against different strains of mycobacteria and showed that disinfectants based on sodium dichloroisocyanurate were more effective. Moreover, they concluded that clinical strains were more resistant to biocides than laboratory type strains. 73 Other studies have shown that chlorhexidine at 0.5% concentration is the best choice, among several antiseptics and surface disinfectants (including betadine, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, alcohol and ultraviolet radiation), to kill clinical yeast isolates, either in planktonic cultures or in biofilm. 74 Oie et al. 75 analysed the effects of four different chemical treatments (0.2% alkyldiaminoethyl glycine, 0.01% or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite and 80% ethyl alcohol) on the disinfection of porous and smooth surfaces contaminated by S. aureus in a university hospital. The results demonstrated that the disinfection of porous surfaces was more difficult and none of the disinfectants was effective, highlighting the need for more frequent disinfection and the use of high-level disinfectants on these surfaces. 75 More recently, Speight et al. 76 evaluated the effect of 32 disinfectants on spores of C. difficile by a suspension test and only eight products gave .3 log 10 reduction in viability within 1 min (to have a more realistic simulation of probable real-life exposures) under dirty conditions (3% BSA). These results underscore the importance of carefully selecting the disinfectant to eliminate spores of this particular microorganism. 76 Kim et al. 77 Review concluded that not all biocides used in hospitals can kill this microorganism. Also, the efficacy of disinfectants was higher for planktonic cells (reduction to undetectable levels). 77 Bridier et al. 78 studied the effects of three common disinfectants (peracetic acid, benzalkonium chloride and ortho-phthalaldehyde) on 77 bacterial strains and found that mycobacteria demonstrated a marked resistance to all the biocides.

However, this kind of disinfection has some disadvantages: the application of disinfectants requires an exposure time of at least 5-10 min; the chemicals might react with acids; they might lose their activity in contact with organic substances; and some of them can cause skin, eye and respiratory tract irritation. 23 In this context, new disinfection strategies must be developed and their efficiencies must be evaluated in terms of their potential applications in hospital settings. This need for novel control methods has been emphasized by the increased resistance of bacterial species to some disinfectants, mainly as a consequence of biofilm formation. 31 One of these alternative strategies is steam vapour disinfection, which has been evaluated by different groups. Tanner 84 demonstrated a reduction of 7 log 10 in MRSA, VRE and P. aeruginosa (to undetectable values) within 5 s of application of a steam vapour system. Sexton et al. 23 applied a steam vapour system to combat MRSA, total coliform bacteria and C. difficile cells, attaining a 90% reduction in bacterial levels. Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) is also used for decontamination of clinical surfaces and equipment. Otter and French 85 found that vegetative bacteria and spores (6 -7 log 10 cfu) survived on surfaces for .5 weeks, but were inactivated within 90 min of exposure to HPV in a 100 m 3 test room. Initial inocula of M. tuberculosis ( 3 log 10 ) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (6 log 10 ) were exposed to HPV at 10 locations during room experiments and both microorganisms were inactivated in all locations within 90 min of HPV exposure. 86 Falagas et al. 38 reviewed other studies of disinfection with HPV against MRSA, C. difficile and other pathogens in several sampled hospital locations (including surgical wards, ward side rooms, single isolation rooms, multiple-bed ward bays and bathrooms); complete or almost complete disinfection of the sampled hospital sites was achieved with airborne hydrogen peroxide. HPV appears to have low toxicity and has good compatibility with most inanimate materials. 87 UV light exposure has also been applied for room decontamination. It has been used in air-handling systems and upper-room air-purifying systems to destroy microorganisms and can also inactivate microorganisms on surfaces. 88 UV-C was demonstrated to be effective in eliminating vegetative bacteria on contaminated surfaces (both in the line of sight and behind objects) within 15 min and in eliminating C. difficile spores within 50 min. 89 In other study, a mobile UV-C light unit significantly reduced aerobic colony counts and spores of C. difficile on contaminated surfaces in patient rooms. 88 It was also demonstrated that ceiling-mounted UV germicidal irradiation lamps were effective in reducing the viability of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis vegetative cells and spores after a minimum exposure time of 1 h at an intensity as low as 8 mW/cm 2 . 90 Both the HPV and UV light methods have demonstrated good results. However, they require the removal of patients and healthcare personnel from the room, have a high acquisition cost and increase room turnover time. 91 Moreover, they do not replace standard cleaning and disinfection. 92 Bacterial adhesion to stainless steel surfaces (the most commonly used material in industry and hospitals) is one of the major reasons for cross-contamination in many scenarios. 93 Thus, more recently, different strategies for the production of antimicrobial surfaces with the purpose of reducing HAI have been extensively investigated and developed. Researchers have focused on the development of surfaces with antimicrobial coatings in order to inhibit biofilm formation by either killing the bacteria or preventing their adhesion. Bacterial growth control can then occur by three different modes of action: biocide leaching, which involves the release of a cytotoxic compound to kill attached microorganisms; adhesion prevention, which uses a super-hydrophobic Review 2723 JAC Continued Review 2725 JAC covering in order to prevent microbial adhesion; and contact killing, which consists of disruption of cell membranes in contact with the surface. 13 Many of these techniques consist of surface modification by introduction of antimicrobial substances such as antibiotics, metals (such as copper and silver) and antiseptics. 93 -98 These surfaces can be obtained by different methods, including adsorption, ligand -receptor pairing and covalent binding. 94 Surfaces that release antimicrobial products can work quite efficiently, although they eventually become exhausted and the diffusible antimicrobials pose the potential problem of inducing microbial resistance, since the surfaces are continually releasing active compounds to the environment for a long period of time. 55, 99 Alternatively, the design of surfaces that kill microbes on contact and do not release biocides may solve this problem. The covering of surfaces with transient metals, such as copper and silver as mentioned above, is a well-established strategy. Moreover, surfaces that catalytically produce biocides using externally applied chemical, electrical or optical energy are an interesting alternative. 99 An example of biocide leaching is the use of Surfacine, which incorporates an antimicrobial compound (silver iodide) in a surface-immobilized coating (a modified polyhexamethylenebiguanide). 83 This compound interacts with the microorganism by electrostatic attraction, penetrates the cell and finally kills it. 83 Surfaces treated with silver iodide resulted in excellent elimination of VRE at challenge levels of 100 cfu/in 2 for at least 13 days. 11 Furthermore, these surfaces retained the antimicrobial effect even after cleaning. 11 Photocatalytic oxidation on surfaces coated with titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is also a possible alternative. In the presence of water and oxygen, highly reactive OH 2 radicals generated by TiO 2 and mild UV-A are able to destroy bacteria, thus reducing bacterial contamination. 100 Another example of a product that releases an organic antimicrobial is Microban w , which contains triclosan [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol] as the antimicrobial agent, making the surface resistant to the growth of microorganisms. 55 This antimicrobial technology can be found in hundreds of consumer, industrial and medical products around the world.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 163, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 592, "end": 594, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 936, "end": 938, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1222, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1903, "text": "86", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1921, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2370, "end": 2372, "text": "87", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 2595, "end": 2597, "text": "88", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2811, "end": 2813, "text": "89", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 2969, "end": 2971, "text": "88", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 3241, "end": 3243, "text": "90", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 3458, "end": 3460, "text": "91", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 3527, "end": 3529, "text": "92", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 3708, "end": 3710, "text": "93", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 4482, "end": 4484, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4659, "end": 4665, "text": "93 -98", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4788, "end": 4790, "text": "94", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 5109, "end": 5112, "text": "55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 5113, "end": 5115, "text": "99", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 5513, "end": 5515, "text": "99", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 5707, "end": 5709, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 5828, "end": 5830, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 5966, "end": 5968, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 6052, "end": 6054, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 6331, "end": 6334, "text": "100", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 6576, "end": 6578, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Alternatives to traditional disinfection"}, {"text": "Covalent immobilization of bioactive compounds onto functionalized polymer surfaces has also seen rapid growth in the past decade in such industries as biomedical, textiles, microelectronics, bioprocessing and food packaging. 101 Table 4 presents some examples of the application of these surfaces.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 229, "text": "101", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 237, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Alternatives to traditional disinfection"}, {"text": "Furthermore, other kinds of surface are stimulating intensive research and some of them are already used, while others are promising candidates for practical application. 102 -104 Examples include materials for medical implants (such as catheters), devices and instruments that are in contact with patients, surgical gowns and other protective clothing (such as surgical masks, caps) and polymeric coatings on surfaces such as shower walls. 102, 103 Antimicrobial polymers provide a very suitable strategy for achieving this objective since they can be applied to diverse objects. Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) have also been investigated extensively as biomaterials and biomaterial interfaces and also for bacterial contamination prevention. 104 Gas plasma is another promising alternative to sterilization that can be applied in healthcare services, although it is mainly targeted to equipment rather than to surfaces. Plasma consists of a mixture of photons, electrons, ions, atoms and radicals (such as atomic oxygen, ozone, nitrogen oxides, hydroxyl and superoxide). As a result of air plasma discharges, the gas enters an ionized state (by energetic transfer) and exhibits antimicrobial properties. 9, 20, 105, 106 Two types of plasma can be defined according to the conditions under which the plasma is formed: thermal and non-thermal plasmas. Compared with non-thermal plasmas, thermal plasmas require higher pressure and are characterized by higher temperatures and a local thermodynamic equilibrium. 105,106 These systems have many advantages over more conventional disinfection techniques as they enable the disinfection of the interior of some types of equipment and materials, such as needles, at low cost and with easy handling. 107,108 Furthermore, gas plasma does not require chemical products and it is not toxic to the skin. 20 Shimizu et al. 108 performed treatments with plasma using a surface micro-discharge device, under different temperature and humidity conditions. The antimicrobial effect was tested on Escherichia coli and Enterococcus mundtii with a reduction of 5 log 10 after 15 and 30 s of plasma treatment for E. mundtii and E. coli, respectively. 108 Other researchers have developed a large-scale plasma dispenser and evaluated its effect on E. coli and Candida albicans in agar plates in the presence and absence of textiles. 107 Their results demonstrated that the system was not affected by the presence of the textile, and in both cases a 15 s treatment caused a 5 log 10 reduction and, after treatment for 5 s, the fungi were reduced by 4 log 10 . Joshi et al. 10 studied the biocidal efficacy of non-thermal dielectricbarrier discharge plasma against E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA in biofilms and planktonic cells. The planktonic cells were completely eliminated after 120 s of treatment, whereas the MRSA growing in biofilms were killed by .60% within 15 s, suggesting that the effectiveness of a plasma system is highly dependent on exposure time and cell density. 10 Recent investigations evaluated the effect of non-thermal gas plasma on biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis and MRSA on glass surfaces; a log 10 reduction of 4 and 4.5 was observed after 1 h of exposure, respectively, and greater reductions could be attained with more prolonged exposure times. 9 Burts et al. 20 tested an atmospheric non-thermal plasma as a disinfectant for hospital pagers by analysis of MRSA reduction, and found complete disinfection within 30 s. Different cell densities and exposure times were also evaluated and a 4 -5 log 10 reduction was obtained within 10 min.
