Design guidelines often assume that interface habits are beneficial. However, we lack quantitative evidence of how the development of habits actually affect user performance and an understanding of how changes in the interface design may affect habit development. Our work quantifies the effect of habit formation and disruption on user performance in interaction. Through a forced choice lab study task (n=19) and in the wild deployment (n=18) of a notification dialog experiment on smartphones, we show that people become more accurate and faster at option selection as they develop an interface habit. Crucially this performance gain is entirely eliminated once the habit is disrupted. We discuss reasons for this performance shift and analyse some disadvantages of interface habits, outlining general design patterns on how to both support and disrupt them.",

Even with optimal intentions to follow these guidelines, changes are regularly made to interfaces that incorporate new features and design norms. When this occurs, previously learned habits may become disrupted, meaning users have to relearn how to perform desired actions. Currently there is limited quantitative evidence specifically addressing how these disruptions affect performance.",

To do this we conducted two studies (one in the lab and one in the wild) examining the building of interface habits. Our studies indicate that as people develop a habit, they become quicker and more accurate at option selection. A concentrated set of repetitions over 80 trials in the lab was enough to create strong improvements in speed and accuracy. In addition, more dispersed daily interactions within a 22-day period in the wild were also enough to see significant improvements in speed. Yet once these habits are disrupted, all performance benefits are significantly reduced.",

Although habits are commonly defined in the literature as \"learned sequences of acts that have become automatic responses to specific cues\" (Verplanken & Aarts, 1999, p 104) , there is currently a debate in the literature as to what truly constitutes a habit. In an effort to reduce the conflation between habits as behaviours and habits as causes of behaviours, Gardner (2015a) defines a habit as \"a process by which a stimulus automatically generates an impulse towards action, based on learned stimulus-response associations\" (p. 4), which isolates the description to that of impulses to act, regardless of whether an act is completed. Critically these actions and/or impulses have a degree of automaticity, and tend to be instigated during stable contexts (Orbell & Verplanken, 2010) .",

These become automatic when context-response associations are created in procedural memory, bypassing the need to analyse the context when searching for an appropriate response (Wood & Neal, 2007) . This benefits users by decreasing the cognitive load required to complete frequently repeated actions (Law, Wehrt, Sonnentag, & Weyers, 2017) leaving more cognitive resources for other activities. While many actions are initially performed with goal-driven intentions, over time repeated exposure to stable contextual cues reinforces the association within procedural memory (Wood & Neal, 2007) . This diminishes the need for the initial goal-driven motivation (Wood & R\u00fcnger, 2016) making a habit primarily driven by environmental context rather than a specific goal. As highlighted by Gardner (2015a) the process of learning stimulus-response associations is critical in forming a habit, with the strength of the stimulus-response associations dictating the strength of the developed habit.",

Rather than just displaying information, these notifications commonly include a request for the user to select a function from a set of options, much like a dialog box. These types of notifications can become strong cues that instigate particular habitual responses to clear them. Notifications act as frequent calls for users to perform a consistent action and can act as gateway to further app use (Oulasvirta et al., 2012) , making them optimal habitual response cues. Any design changes to these cues are likely to disrupt the habits that users form around an interface. Design changes are believed to force users out of automatic behaviour, removing their attention from the task, and instead focusing it back on the design of the interface (Raskin, 2000) .",

Yet these types of measures can have downsides. Awareness decreases as automaticity develops (MacLeod & Dunbar, 1988) , making subjective reflection on the automatic process potentially less reliable. Because of this, measures like response time and accuracy have been used as successful alternatives in gauging automaticity (Logan, 1979; Poldrack et al., 2005) . We therefore measure how long people take to select the label (Response Time) and the accuracy of their response (Response Accuracy) in each of the trials.",

This analysis allowed us to assess the impact of the fixed effects (in this case the within participant variable: Experiment Phases) on the participant's response time, whilst controlling for individual differences in participant performance through random effects (for comprehensive review see Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013) . In accordance with Barr et al. (2013) , we ran the maximal model with by-participant random slopes, simplifying the model where needed to achieve convergence. The LME model includes Experiment Phases as a fixed effect (3 levels -Baseline, Habit & Disruption) and by-participant random slopes (random effect).

Study 2 was conducted on a much smaller screen, with participants having to read more detailed written instructions on this display. This increased focus could have led to higher selection times compared to Study 1. Nevertheless, the clear difference in response time between the phases show how in the wild measures can still be useful in quantifying increased automaticity in response to a cue, providing a useful metric for interface habit development.",

Once again, this supports previous psychological research on habits that describe the negative effects of habit disruption on speed (Anderson, Folk, Garrison, & Rogers, 2016; Lally, van Jaarsveld, Potts, & Wardle, 2010) , with only partial support for effects in accuracy (Logan, 1979) . The discrepancy in the findings for accuracy may have arisen due to limitations of a study conducted outside controlled conditions. The real-world mobile notification context may be a contributory factor in this. Dialogs were presented when performing other tasks, subsequently interrupting the user.

Once in procedural memory, participants no longer need to read the labels to allow them to select the correct action and can rely solely on their automatic reaction. While it could be argued that improvements in response time occurred because the habit phase was easier, the reality is that the task was only easier due to the increase in automaticity from the development of a habitual response. If a user was not able to form habits or move associations into procedural memory, they would not see such an improvement in performance. This deterioration or inability to learn new response patterns can be seen in patients suffering from damage to brain regions associated with procedural memory (Ackermann, Daum, Schugens, & Grodd, 1996) but is not seen when the damage is associated with other types of memory (Cohen & Squire, 1980) .",

We show that disrupting this habit development has serious consequences for user performance, leading people to be slower when selecting options. We also show that response times can be used effectively to differentiate between users who are and are not forming an interface habit, allowing for different actions to be targeted at each group.

Although further work would need to be done to identify how our findings would scale to more general and major changes to interfaces (e.g.operating system interface changes), our work points to the need to carefully consider the effects of making such large-scale changes. Systems could be more aware of the need to supply extra confirmations or ways to undo functions for previously heavily habitual tasks identified on previous designs. This would make the new design more sympathetic to people's previous habitual actions.6.1.5 The importance of deliberate habit disruption.It must be noted that there are also circumstances in which deliberate disruption of interface habits may be required.Cox, Gould, Cecchinato, Iacovides, and Renfree (2016) describe such disruption as micro boundaries and suggest their use principally to encourage reflection and subsequent behaviour change. This type of deliberate disruption of built up habits should be considered where execution of habitual selection may lead to irreversible, and potentially dangerous outcomes",
