Now, to meet the critical and quickly intensifying need, Chinese and American engineers are devising new procedures for decontaminating and reusing masks that hospitals already have on hand (Fig. 1 ) [1] . Although some of these procedures require specialized equipment, others are simple enough to use at home (Fig. 2) [2, 3] .",

The most time-consuming part of the procedure is de-gassing; it usually takes 4 h before the decontamination room is safe to enter. But the masks are safe to wear after that, because the hydrogen peroxide decomposes into oxygen and water. Using the Bioquell Z-2 hydrogen peroxide vapor generator (Fig. 4) , the Duke staff can disinfect 1250 masks per cycle, and 2500 per 12 h shift [1] .",
