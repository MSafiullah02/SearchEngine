            "text": "CD4+ T\u2010helper (Th) cells are critical components of the adaptive immunity in the lung (Fig. \n1). The development of these cells arises after priming with antigen presented by class II major histocompatibility complexes (termed signal 1). Further activation occurs after the engagement of costimulatory molecules and their receptors expressed on both antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs) and T cells (termed signal 2). This second signal is critical for both generating antigen\u2010specific effector T cells as well as memory cells. Presentation of antigen in the absences of costimulation can result in T\u2010cell anergy. Final effector function is due to cytokine/growth factor\u2010directed CD4+ T\u2010cell differentiation (signal 3). This latter aspect of differentiation is driven by lineage\u2010specific transcription factors as well as changes in chromatin remodeling. The critical role of CD4+ T cells in lung immunity and pulmonary host defenses was clearly demonstrated by the high incidence of pulmonary infections as a complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 1, 2, 3.",

            "text": "Th2 CD4+ T cells differentiate from naive precursors under the direction of the transcription factor GATA3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) 4. Effector cytokines produced by Th2 cells include interleukin\u20104 (IL\u20104), IL\u20105, and IL\u201013. GATA3 binds directly to the Il4 locus, and IL\u20104 and signaling via STAT6 is critical for further Th2 proliferation and lineage commitment 4. Th2 effector cytokines mediate immunity against infections with helminths (Fig. \n2). Deletion of Gata3 in mice results is embryonic lethal, but conditional deletion of Gata3 in T cells confirms the essential role of this transcription factor in Th2 differentiation and the expulsion of helminths from the gastrointestinal tract 5. IL\u20105 is an essential growth factor for eosinophilopoiesis 6, 7. Mice with homozygous deletion of Il5 have substantial reduction in both peripheral and bone marrow eosinophils 6, 7. In contrast, overexpression of IL\u20105 protein results in substantial eosinophilia in blood and tissues 8. IL\u201013 signals through a receptor complex of IL13RA1 and IL4R\u03b1 and activates STAT6 signaling. These receptors are expressed on airway epithelium as well as airway smooth muscle. In bronchial epithelium, IL\u201013 is a major factor in mucous production and goblet cell differentiation in the airway 9, 10. Moreover, IL\u201013 signaling via STAT6 in airway smooth muscle and in airway epithelium leads to airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine 9, 10. These cells and effector cytokines have been implicated in diseases such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma 11. Anti\u2010IL\u20105 has been investigated in asthma and although initial studies did not show clear cut efficacy 12, but subgroups of patients with high sputum eosinophilia respond to IL\u20105 blockade 12. Similarly, initial studies with IL\u201013 blockade were also negative, but recently, studies suggest that by stratifying patients with IL\u201013 driven asthma (by assessing the serum level of periostin, an IL\u201013 regulated gene in lung epithelium) can identify subgroups who respond to anti\u2010IL\u201013 13. In addition to asthma, IL\u201013 has been implicated in fibrotic processes in the lung in response to drugs such as bleomycin 14, 15, 16.",

Differentiation of CD4+ Th1 cells is controlled by the transcription factors T\u2010bet 19 and STAT4. Differentiation is controlled by IL\u201012p70, which is a heterodimer of IL\u201012p35 and IL\u201012p40 subunits 20. However, both in vitro and in vivo Th1 differentiation can be independent of IL\u201012. One critical IL\u201012\u2010independent pathway is through the induction of type I interferons that can facilitate Th1 differentiation in certain situations 21. IFN\u2010\u03b3 which signals via a receptor complex consisting of two IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 and two IFN\u2010\u03b3R2 chains can signal in an autocrine paracrine fashion to further amplify Th1 differentiation and lineage commitment. IFN\u2010\u03b3 receptors are expressed on a wide variety of cells including myeloid cells including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), as well as structural cells in the lung such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts 22. IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3R2 activate Janus\u2010associated kinases 1 and 2 (JAK1/2), which phosphorylates STAT1. STAT1 undergoes homodimerization and translocation to the nucleus and binds to DNA\u2010encoded \u03b3\u2010activated sequences that ultimately control gene transcription 22.",

Th17 cells differentiate under control of the transcription factors retinoid orphan receptor\u2010\u03b3 (ROR\u03b3), ROR\u2010\u03b1, and STAT3 26, 27. It was initially believed that one of the critical instructional cytokines for Th17 differentiation was IL\u201023 28; however, IL\u201023 receptors are not expressed on naive CD4+ T cells. Landmark studies published in 2005 showed that these cells develop independently of STAT4 or STAT6 as well as T\u2010bet or GATA3 29, 30. These data implicated that Th17 cells were a distinct CD4+ T\u2010cell lineage 29, 30. Th17 differentiation can occur with stimulation with transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) and IL\u20106 31, 32, 33. Moreover, this cytokine/growth factor combination induces the expression of IL\u201023R 31, 32, 33. Signaling via IL\u201023 allows terminal differentiation and expansion of Th17 cells 34. Another critical effector cytokine produced by Th17 cells is IL\u201022, which is controlled by IL\u201023 as well as the transcription factor the arylhydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) 35. IL\u201021 36, 37 can function in an autocrine manner to further expand Th17 differentiation (Fig. \n1). It has been recently shown in vivo that TGF\u03b2 activation and thus differentiation of Th17 cells requires activation of latent TGF\u03b2 by \u03b1v integrins 38, 39. This pathway is not required for IL\u201017 production by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells 38, 39.",

It has been shown that IL\u20104 treatment of macrophages can reduce their phagocytic ability, but IL\u20104 stimulation of macrophages can augment the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils 63. Alternatively, activated macrophages (AAMs) play regulatory roles in helminth infection and can reduce immunopathology 63. It has also been shown that AAMs have augmented dectin\u20101 expression as well as the macrophage mannose receptor. Given that both of these receptors are critical in recognizing the fungal carbohydrates \u03b21,3 glucan and mannan, respectively, AAMs may have greater fungicidal activity. Induction of AAMs may also be exploited by pathogens to allow their survival.

Thus, IL\u201017A and IL\u201017F have limited activity on myeloid cells. It has been reported that IL\u201017 can enhance IL\u201012p70 in alveolar macrophages 89 as well CCL2, CCL3, GM\u2010CSF, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20109 in CD4+ T cells 90. Th17 cells express IL\u201017RA and IL\u201017RE, which form a receptor complex for IL\u201017C 91, 92, 93. IL\u201017C can increase the production of IL\u201017 by these cells 91, 92, 93. IL\u201017C can be expressed in lung epithelium (unpublished observations) and thus can serve as a feed forward mechanism by which the epithelium could influence interstitial T\u2010cell responses. In addition to regulating neutrophil recruitment in the lung 94, IL\u201017 augments apical bicarbonate transport in HBE cells 95. Carbonate anion regulates the activity of \u03b2 defensins 96, and this may be an important mechanism of IL\u201017's net anti\u2010microbial effect in the lung mucosa.",

However, CD4+ Th17 cells can be elicited in the lung by vaccination. Vaccine\u2010induced Th17 responses have been shown to play protective roles in a diverse set of organisms including both intracellular and extracellular bacteria as well as fungi. For example, Th17 cells induced by vaccination with the antigen from M. tuberculosis ESAT\u20106 induce a population of Th17 cells that augment the local production of ligands for CXCR3 in the lung and result in substantial enhanced recruitment of protective Th1 cells 103. Fungal\u2010specific Th17 cells have also been shown to be critical for vaccine\u2010induced protection against Coccidioides posadasii, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Blastomyces dermatitidis infection 104.

Chen et al. 48 have also shown that Th17 cells elicited by K. pneumoniae vaccination recognize conserved outer membrane proteins in the cell wall of the bacteria and these antigens could also provide serotype\u2010independent immunity. Th17 cells conferred heterologous protection against multiple serotypes of the organism 48. Thus, in two models of important human extracelluar pathogens, Th17 cells are capable of mediating serotype\u2010independent immunity which may advance vaccine approaches against these pathogens. It still remains to be defined which specific aspects of Th17 function that are required for protection. There needs to be better understanding of factors important in generating mucosal Th17 cells in the lung such as adjuvants, factor regulating proliferation, homing, and survival.
