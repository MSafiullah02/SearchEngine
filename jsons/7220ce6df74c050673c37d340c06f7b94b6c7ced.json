Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of \"immune enhancement\"). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway. Translational consequences of these findings are explored.",

This suggests, at least partly, an autoimmunology basis of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. A number of causal bases of autoimmunity from exposure to viral epitopes is well established, whether the route of administration be by exposure via infection or vaccination. Systemic respiratory viral infections can have numerous serious health effects, including dyspnea, hypoxemia, dysuria, meningitis, low blood pressure, shock and death. Sequalae of viral infections can include various short-term and sometimes permanent effects on the central nervous system, via direct injury to CNS tissue due to viral replication (viral neuropathology) or due to the host immune system learning to attack CNS tissue (viral neuroimmunopathology). The public health consequences from some viruses can include impaired immunity, encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases such as demyelinating disorders and relapsing events such as those seen in multiple sclerosis (MS).",

The etiology of the age-specific mortality seen in COVID-19 is largely unknown. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Other tissues are obviously also potential targets for viral immunopathology, including mucosal cells of the intestine, epithelial cells of the kidneys, brain cells (neurons), and cellular components of the immune system. In severe cases of SARS, and likely in SARS-CoV-2, this viral targeting leads acutely to pneumonia.
