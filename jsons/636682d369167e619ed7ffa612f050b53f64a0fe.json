The minimal requirements for the POC blood-testing device are blood microsampling, blood separation, immunoassay, and detection and communication of the signals. The microsampling of the blood can be achieved by specialized needle, which can be connected to the microchip or analytical devices. The sampled blood is then separated using either a filter (weir or pillar type), or by the phenomena unique to microfluidic system. The separated blood should then go through sandwich, homogeneous non-competitive, or competitive immunoassay, which can effectively diagnose diverse diseases. Lastly, the device should detect and translate the immune-signals to readable, and clinically significant signals. The development of such device will play a great role for improving healthcare technology.",

            "text": "Despite recent remarkable progress in medical technology, the challenge of overcoming diverse critical diseases\u2212including cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and Alzheimer's\u2212still remains. Even though the complete treatment of these diseases is difficult, early diagnosis might be one of the crucial clues for the patient survival and successful prognosis of the disease. To date, several techniques have been developed for the early detection of such diseases, but most of these techniques are lab-based, complex, slow, and also require experienced personnel to conduct the analysis. Moreover, the patients need to visit medical service centers, such as hospitals, for the diagnosis. However, the contemporary generation simply does not have time to spare on regular medical checkups, which prevents the early detection of disease. To minimize the patients' inconvenience, the analysis of blood sample, saliva, urine and body fluid at home or office and the direct transfer of data through networks are highly required. Therefore, there has been an ever-increasing need for novel, efficient, easy and personal diagnostic tools for the early detection of diseases, especially at the point-of-care (POC) [1, 2] . However, the technical limits (size, sensitivity, etc.) have hindered the realization of such POC devices. Recent rapid progress in microfluidic technologies has played a pivotal role in handling and processing quite a small amount of liquid, and the integration of biosensors in the microfluidic chips has extended the application of 'lab on a chip (LOC)' to biomedical areas [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . More importantly, size, compact integration of the components, low sample volume consumption, and fast analysis and response time due to short diffusion distances may enhance the portability of device as well as shortening the diagnosis time and enabling the integration of LOC to electronic devices such as smartphone, and personal computers (PC). Supported by LOC technology, the POC device for the ubiquitous diagnosis could be achieved.",

To narrow the focus, we concentrated on the diagnosis from a small amount of blood. For this purpose, blood microscale sampling, blood separation, immunochemical assay, and detection (optical and electrical), and communication to personal device (such as smart phones or PC) are the essentially required processes (Fig. 1) . Especially, the data stored in the PC or smartphone can be transmitted to doctors and nurses for analysis and earliest possible diagnosis. Here, we have described the technical status and trends about these four processes and considered a future prospects. The described LOC technologies for in situ diagnosis can be extensively used even for diagnosis of the extremely contagious and infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. The early detection of such contagious diseases will greatly contribute to prevent the rapid spread throughout the global world.",

Therefore, a small sample of blood can reveal a lot about a patients' health status. The blood contains white blood cells (that can be counted for the immune-responses), red blood cells (anemia, sickle cell disease), and platelets (blood clotting activity), as well as plasma that contain the possible bacteria and virus that can affect the bodily functions. Thus, blood sampling in a microscale amount, and loading the sample to diagnostic device is important. Traditional sampling method is a simple collection of blood using the syringe. A rather large amount of blood was drawn using the needle of the syringe, and then discharged into the prepared test tubes containing the additives such as Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citrate. Sometimes, the blood had to be collected multiple times if a patient needs to be tested for multiple diseases. This method of blood sampling had many shortcomings, as the whole process was time consuming as well as providing a lot of room for error.",

Li et al. have developed a system that can sample blood from a laboratory mouse in the ~ 1 L range by eliminating the large dead/ transfer volumes of conventional approaches (Fig. 2) [9]. The system draws blood sample through the needle and into a biocompatible steel reservoir that could be interchanged for a microanalytical chip. In the microfluidic sampling system, the needle must at least penetrate through the stratum corneum layer of the skin into the dermis layer, which indicates the importance of the needle [10] . Several blood or body fluid sampling systems that are simple, biocompatible and stable have been developed. S. Aoyagi proposes a biodegradable polymer (Poly Lactic Acid (PLA)) needle with a trench for collecting blood [11] . Because hollow needles are difficult to fabricate, etching a trench on the needle surface has been proposed as an alternative. E.V. Mukerjee et al. have developed micro-needle array for the effective puncturing of human skin and extracting and delivering interstitial fluid (ISF) to the microchannels [12] . Besides, diverse micro-pumping and valve systems can be combined with microneedles to enable delivery and extraction of blood and body fluids of accurate amount.",

The cells can be separated from the blood based on their sizes, and weights.

Conventionally, the physical membranebased filtration has been widely used because it is simple and relatively efficient. However, the high cellular fractions lead to membrane clogging and compromise the separation efficiency. The FACS and MACS are methods that sort cells with high precision. But the technical requirements for these methods are too expensive and complicated to be used for a point of care diagnosis, and the machines required for these are not mobile at all, being bulky and heavy. In addition, these macro-scale cell-sorting methods have their limitations in complicated sample preparation procedures, target cell loss, requirement of skilled technician and introduction of artifacts, which are highly undesirable for the point of care diagnosis.",

The separation using filter or mesh is most common, and integration of such small filter in the microfluidic chip is one of popular methods in blood separation. In a microfluidic chip, diverse shapes of filters are used for blood separation, and among them, the comb, pillar, weir-type and microparticle based filters are popular ( Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b ). VanDelinder and Groisman devised weirs of gap size 0.5 m that can weed out the WBCs, RBCs, and platelets while letting the plasma pass through [15] . The device can operate continuously for an hour extracting up to 8% of plasma at the flow speed of 0.65 L/min and with less than 0.1% hemolysis. Moorthy and Beebe came up with a microporous filter within the microchannel using the emulsion photo polymerization to filter through the whole blood that can be utilized to extract the plasma from the sample [16] . Crowley and Pizziconi also utilized the microfilters of planar shape to separate the plasma from the whole blood. They demonstrated the design and operation of passive microfilter devices applicable to the separation of plasma from whole blood in miniaturized clinical diagnostic devices [17] . Chen suggested pillar-and weir-type filtration microchips, and optimized cell concentration and length of separation channels to enhance the separation efficiency, and 95% RBC can be removed from the initial whole blood, while 27.4% WBC can be obtained [18] .",

The microfluidic network was designed using an analogous electrical circuit and the experimentally determined plasma selectivity with respect to blood hematocrit level was almost 100% [20] . Some researchers also developed a microfluidic device capable of separating WBCs from the whole blood without any pretreatment and lysing the separated WBCs in a continuous and near real-time fashion. Choi et al. have developed isolation method of WBCs using a microfluidic device composed of slanted obstacles and filtration obstacles, and the device isolated WBCs with 210-fold enrichment within a short filtration time of ~ 0.3 s [21] .

The most distinguished aspects of the micro-scale immunoassays are its simplicity, efficiency, and the speed. First of all, the on-chip immunoassay allows for extreme simplification of the whole procedure. The simplicity comes from the integration of all immunoassay steps on one chip. The traditional immunoassay procedures require sampling of the whole blood, separation of the cells, and many other steps before the actual immunoassay takes place. Also, data needs to be collected in a separate apparatus, and analyzed before the results can be presented. However, the on-chip immunoassay integrates all those preceding steps, detection, and analysis into one, which increases the mobility of it. This makes the micro-scale immunoassay highly desirable for POC, or single use assays that can be widely distributed to the public. The on-chip immunoassay allows the increase of precision by decreasing the volume of the analytes. The small size of it not only increases the mobility and precision of this diagnostic tool, but also allows multiple assays to be done in simultaneously: the micro-scale immunoassay widens the scope of the analysis [22] . Lastly, the on-chip immunoassay is kinetically efficient. By reducing the distance the molecules need to travel, the assay can be done in a speedier manner without affecting its results [23] .",

The emitted light from the labeled molecules is detected by the photodetector. Hu et al. utilized the aqueous- phase-synthesized quantum dots (aqQDs) as fluorescent markers to develop highly sensitive (femtomolar sensitivity) microfluidic platform for detecting the cancer biomarkers [32] . Luminescence detection, on the other hand, measures the spontaneously generated luminescence intensity without the excitation light source because an enzymatic reaction between luminescent substrates and enzyme reagents causes photochemical emission. In 2007, Battacharyya et al. developed a microfluidic chip for detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) using chemiluminescence-based immunoassay. The assay results were presented on an on-chip instant photographic film, which was then read by an imager that can detect the chemiluminescent signals [33] . In colorimetry, colored stains resulting from the immunoassay is measured by a spectrophotometer. Despite the poor sensitivity of colorimetry compared to that of other optical methods, the simplicity and potential for miniaturization of colorimetry provide several advantages. Yu et al. developed a dextran-functionalized microfluidic immunosensor that can demonstrate colorimetric detection of several biomarkers (IL-5, hepatitis B surface antigen, and immunoglobulin G) in sera through spectrophotometer or naked eyes. The dextran modification on the microfluidic channel surface enhanced the hydrophilicity and the efficiency in protein immobilization, distinguishing this particular platform from the other colorimetric platforms with a high sensitivity (detection limit of up to 100pg/ ml) [34] . SPR is one of the useful biosensing systems to investigate biomolecular interactions and has diverse features including label-free, real-time, high-throughput, and sensitive analysis. SPR is also the most common optical evanescent wave biosensor. This type of detection uses the variation of the reflectivity on a metallic layer, which when closely in contact with a dielectric media, reflects the concentration of bound target (Fig. 5 (right) ). Kurita et al. successfully detected a cardiac marker B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) with the detection level of 5 pg/ml -100 ng/ml. This was achieved by monitoring the real-time SPR angle shift while accumulating the thiol compound (generated by the enzymatic reaction during the immunoreaction) on a gold thin film on the microfluidic platform [35] . SERS was first introduced in order to enhance the sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy. The method incorporates metallic nanostructures or surfaces to improve the sensitivity from 10 6 to 10 14 . SERS provides molecular information and its unique features are non-destructive, non-invasive, works in-situ and in-vitro for biological samples. In addition, SERS can operate irrespective of temperature and pressure. The molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces enhance Raman scattering and enhancement factors can be over 10 10 , which are sufficient to allow even single molecule detection. Chon et al. used SERS of hollow gold nanospheres on a microfluidic chip to successfully detect the target marker. The limit of detection on the specific target marker they used (rabbit immunoglobin, IgG) was estimated to be 1 -10 ng/ml [36] .",

This method of detection is highly sensitive as well as rapid and selective in determining the analytes, and they can be easily incorporated into the miniaturized POC devices. The electrochemical immunosensors detect the electric signals that arise from the immunoreactions that occur near the surface of the electrodes. The two main types of electrochemical reactions-redox, and non-redox\u2212that can be detected by the immunosensors are discussed here. Most redox-based detection relies on the electrochemical signals that the conjugated enzyme generates in enzymelabeled assays. Commonly, the redox species such as Prussian blue (PB) are added to monitor the electron transfer in the enzymatic reaction [37] . Rossier and Girault presented ELISA with electrochemical detection on a microchip with the horseradish peroxidase-secondary antibody conjugate (HRP-conjugate) as the enzymatic mediator (to catalyze electron transfer reaction). They incorporated the electrode inside a 40 nL microchannel that can detect the redox active enzyme substrate directly in the microchannel. The apparatus detected 0.1 -100 nM of D-Dimer with the sandwich immunoassay, which was the relevant concentration level for clinical settings [38] . Meanwhile, enzymatic reactions that convert an electrochemically inactive substrate into active product can be another signal that can be electrochemically detected. Jang et al. used the alkaline phosphate (AP) labeled secondary antibody to convert the electrochemically inactive substrate into active p-aminophenol, which was measured by the oxidation peak current during electro-oxidation into pquinoneimine (PQI) at the working electrode. Using this method, Jang and her coworkers were able to detect with the limit as low as 485 pg/mL with 95% accuracy [39] . The electrochemical signals can also be generated by the nonredox reactions. Zhao et al. reported a novel non-redox based electrochemical immunoassay. They used the Cadmium-Sulfur (CdS) quantum dots (QDs) on the electrode surface, allowing for the photoelectrochemical sensing. The HRP conjugated with the antibody allowed for the precipitation on the CdS-QD electrodes, which was directly proportional to the target concentration [40] .",

            "text": "Detecting for mechanical signals is another way of immunosensing. Mechanical detection provides highly sensitive and multiplexed analysis in a short period of time. This method usually involves immobilized antibodies on a sensing surface, and the binding of the target antigens onto these antibodies, which causes physical disruption of the equilibrium state, and ultimately, a mass change. This change in mass can be detected by the use of microcantilevers (MCs) or acoustic wave sensors. These offer highly sensitive detection of the mass changes, and do not require labels, thus deeming suitable for the POC diagnostic devices. The use of microcantilevers in immunosensors provides sensitive and label-free detection. The deflection mode of detection is based on the change in the mechanical deflection of the MC that occurs as a result of antigen binding. In 2005, Backmann et al. reported a MCbased immunosensor that operates on a deflection mode with a sensitivity level comparable to the SPR. Using the single chain Fv antibody fragments as the receptor molecules, Backmann and the coworkers were able to attain the sensitivity of ~1 nM [41] . MCs working in the resonance mode are generally used to measure the change in resonance frequency resulting from the target binding. These are generally called the \"piezoelectric\" microcantilever (PEMC). Hwang et al. utilized the PEMC in a microfluidic immunosensor. The device allowed for dynamic detection and measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without using the labels [42] .",

In this review, we overviewed the microfluidic technologies that are required per procedure and are currently being actively developed and researched. The developed microfluidic technologies surpass the limit of conventional immunosensing systems by enabling the reduced consumption of reagents and samples, and reducing the assay time, cost, power consumption, and size. In addition, the versatile technologies facilitate the sensitive multiplexed immunosensing and increased realistic clinical applications for POC diagnostics. We expect that the microfluidic immunosensing system on a single microfluidic platform is relevant for use by primary care physicians and outpatient clinics even in developed countries, because in-situ diagnosis can lead to higher rates of correct treatment and lower rates of unnecessary overtreatment [43] . Furthermore, in developing countries or on-going battlefields, the proposed microfluidic immunosensing system will play a great role to save lives and prevent the disease breakouts, such as highly infectious bird flu.",
