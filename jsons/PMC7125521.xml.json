Isothermal gene amplification can resolve the electricity-associated problems (Demidov, 2002, McCarthy et al., 2006). Among the isothermal amplification methods, there have been recent noteworthy studies (Jung et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2015). Through RCA of complementary targets in microfluidic channels, amplified DNA forms DNA hydrogels by adding a dumbbell-shaped padlock probe (Lee et al., 2015). The DNA hydrogels block microchannel flow of a dyed liquid, which can be identified with the naked eye. Unfortunately, the whole process takes 2 h to completely block channel flow. The long process time is mainly due to the limited surface area for pathogen DNA amplification, which occurs at the microchannel surfaces. Furthermore, it requires a large number of DNA strands to form the hydrogel and to block a wide cross-sectional area of the microchannel. In addition, the RCA detection method was further developed by using bead technology. With RCA, nanometer-scale single DNA templates were converted to micrometer-scale fluorescent DNA dots, which can be quantified using an optical device (Jarvius et al., 2006, Sato et al., 2010). However, the bead-based RCA processes encountered various difficulties, including inefficient DNA hybridization and enzymatic reactions, due to physical properties of the bead surface (Sato et al., 2013).",

The core technology in the present study is the formation of a DNA hydrogel on the surfaces of thousands of microbeads packed in a microchannel, blocking the flow path formed between the beads. In this system, the RCA processes occur at each microbead surface. Due to the microbeads packed into the microtube, the surface area on which RCA may occur is significantly increased and the corresponding cross-sectional flow area is decreased. Thus, the present system could significantly shorten the detection time to within 15 min. Furthermore, the limit of detection (LOD) of the present system is 10\u2013100 times increased over that of the previous system (Jung et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2015). Above all, since the present system can be operated after generation of a simple vacuum without any electricity-operated instrument or device, it can be utilized at any location or point-of-care.",

For multiple pathogen detection, the present system shares one sample chamber with multiple channels, which can serve as detection sites for the different pathogens, such as Ebola, MERS, Zika, and Dengue. When a target pathogen exists in a sample, it can bind to the specific template in a tube and a subsequent RCA process occurs. After a certain period of time for the RCA process to occur, sufficiently amplified DNA products become entangled with each other and form a DNA hydrogel, which blocks liquid flow. The syringe is used to generate variable vacuum pressures with a dead volume. Due to the large dead volume (4.1 mL) compared to sample volume (25 \u03bcL), the newly generated vacuum pressure does not significantly change during the entire test.

We adopted the previous design of a molecular padlock to form a DNA hydrogel as the product of RCA (Fig. S2) (Jung et al., 2016). The pathogen template consists of a primer binding site, a pathogen-binding site, and a self-assembly region that form a molecular dumbbell shape. The design of the template considers thermal stability at room temperature and specificity for primer and pathogen hybridization by controlling the length of each region. Upon annealing, the pathogen template forms an asymmetric dumbbell shape. Then, the templates are hybridized with primers immobilized on a microbead surface. When the template on the microbead encounters a target pathogen, they hybridize. With help from a ligase, the opened template can be ligated to form a closed-loop template, which is ready to undergo the RCA process. As time passes, complementary ssDNA strands are elongated with the dumbbell shape by Phi29 polymerase during the RCA process. Since the void space between the adjacent beads is narrow and small, the dumbbell-shaped long DNAs tend to aggregate with neighbor DNAs and form a DNA gel (Fig. S2 (b)).",

As shown in\nFig. 3(a, b), polystyrene beads and Sepharose beads were compared after primer immobilization. If the primers are successfully immobilized on the surface of microbeads, they combine with the complementary fluorescent probe (FAM). Sepharose beads yield vivid fluorescent images (Fig. 3(d)), whereas polystyrene (PS)-beads do not (Fig. 3(c)). We further performed fluorescence analysis using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. S4, the percentage of beads with a high fluorescence intensity (> 103) was 99.9% for Sepharose beads and 0.1% for PS beads. These results indicate that primers were densely immobilized on the surface of the Sepharose beads but not on that of the PS microbeads.",

They confirmed that agarose-based beads showed a higher amplification rate of target DNA compared to plastic beads using an RCA process. They also speculated that the reaction area of the polystyrene beads was smaller than that of the porous Sepharose beads and, thus, the polystyrene beads showed a lower amplification rate than did Sepharose beads. Even though we did not describe in detail, various beads were tried and agarose-based hydrogel beads and magnetic beads were the only ones successful to immobilize the primers. Thus, we decided to use the agarose gel beads (Sepharose\u2122) in the present study.",

For the present test, the RCA process time was fixed at 30 min. Also, the length of the bead-packed tube was fixed at 20 mm. The result of the pressure at which ink flows with varying pathogen concentration is shown in Fig. 4(a). When there was no target in a sample and, thus, there was no occurrence of the RCA process, there was not any blockage in the bead-packed tube. The fundamental flow resistance of the bead-packed tube requires 3.65 kPa to cause ink to flow through the bead-packed tube. When target pathogen DNA was present at a concentration of 0.01 pM, the required pressure to pass through the bead-packed tube was slightly increased but that amount was not statistically significant. The pressure increase in the control was mainly due to DNA hydrogel formation in the bead-packed tube. Thus, we defined the pressure on the vertical axis as the critical pressure to break the DNA gelation inside the bead-packed tube. When the pathogen concentration was 0.1 pM, the critical vacuum pressure was significantly different from those for the control and 0.01 pM (p < 0.05). Furthermore, when the concentration of target pathogens was higher than 0.1 pM, the critical pressure was significantly different from the control (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, we also calculated the LOD of concentration according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC) guideline. First, we calculated the LOD of the suction pressure, which was 5.06 kPa, which can be utilized as a cut-off critical pressure. Using a calibration curve for pressure vs. pathogen concentration, the LOD of concentration was calculated as 0.019 pM.",

Thus, the short detection time is critical for point-of-care devices and sensors. Thus, we examined the minimum test time required for pathogen detection via the RCA process in the present microfluidic system. The pathogen DNA concentration was fixed at 1 pM In addition, the length of the bead-packed tube was fixed at 20 mm. As shown in Fig. 4(b), there was a significant difference after 15 min of the RCA process time (p < 0.05). After 20 min of the RCA process, the critical pressures were significantly different (p < 0.001) from that of the control (0 min). The LOD and detection time for various pathogens were similar. These results would be natural since the whole experimental conditions except for the pathogen binding site are the same each other. Considering these results, the present LOD is 10\u2212100 times higher than previous results (Jung et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2015), using naked eye detection. Furthermore, the minimum time for detection of pathogens using the RCA process was dramatically reduced from 2 h to 15 min by adopting the bead-based RCA process.",

All test procedures can be completed within 30 min. Thus, the present system can be further simplified with a syringe and a multi-channel-equipped microfluidic chip. The syringe is specially designed to have two stop positions: one for the dead volume and another for the fixed cut-off vacuum pressure.

For calibration purposes, we added a positive control tube, which should be blocked with any sample.

The increase in surface area for the RCA reaction could shorten the detection time by up to 15 min, but did not increase the detection limit. By integrating multi-channel designs, multiplex analysis can be performed simultaneously for detection of a variety of infectious pathogens.
