Broad sampling has revealed the importance of bats in the diversification and spread of viruses and eukaryotes to other animal hosts. Vector-borne bacteria of the genus Bartonella are prevalent and diverse in mammals globally and recent surveys have revealed numerous Bartonella lineages in bats. We assembled a sequence database of Bartonella strains, consisting of nine genetic loci from 209 previously characterized lineages and 121 new cultured strains from bats, and used these data to perform the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Bartonella to date. This analysis included estimation of divergence dates using a molecular clock and ancestral reconstruction of host associations and geography. We estimate that Bartonella began infecting mammals 62 million years ago near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Additionally, the radiation of particular Bartonella clades correlate strongly to the timing of diversification and biogeography of mammalian hosts. Bats were inferred to be the ancestral hosts of all mammal-associated Bartonella and appear to be responsible for the early geographic expansion of the genus. We conclude that bats have had a deep influence on the evolutionary radiation of Bartonella bacteria and their spread to other mammalian orders. These results support a 'bat seeding' hypothesis that could explain similar evolutionary patterns in other mammalian parasite taxa. Application of such phylogenetic tools as we have used to other taxa may reveal the general importance of bats in the ancient diversification of mammalian parasites.",

We hypothesize that mammal-infecting bartonellae evolved with their hosts starting in the late Cretaceous or early Paleogene when many eutherian and metatherian taxa diversified (21) . We expect to see clustering of lineages associated by host orders and correlation between diversification dates of hosts and Bartonella clades. Using ancestral state reconstruction and network analysis, we discern which orders of mammals were highly influential in the diversification and spread of Bartonella to other host orders and geographic regions. We predict that the speciose orders of bats (Chiroptera) and rodents (Rodentia) are important in the historical expansion of the Bartonella genus, however bats may have a more profound influence in this process because of their ability to fly and quickly disperse over wide areas. This study provides a more complete understanding of Bartonella evolution and biogeography and the role of bats as important hosts of pathogens through a suite of phylogenetic methods that can be adapted to understand these processes in other host-specific parasites and symbionts. Such investigations could lead to a deeper evolutionary understanding of symbiosis and parasitism and the identification of key host groups in the diversification and spread of these organisms. ",

To determine a clock prior for the 16S rRNA locus, we analyzed published 16S rRNA sequence divergence and host divergence times for bacterial symbionts of arthropods (17) . A linear regression model was fit to the data in R (26) and a lognormal prior was estimated by moment matching to the normal distribution for the fitted mean and standard error of the slope (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ). The prior distribution for the exponential clock rate for 16S rRNA was set to this lognormal distribution while prior distributions for the exponential clocks of the remaining eight loci were set to an approximate reference prior for continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) rates (27) . Thus, the 16S rRNA clock acts a strong prior and the rates for the other eight loci are estimated relative to the 16S rRNA rate. This approach allows for external validation of Bartonella diversification events based on host diversification dates without explicitly using host diversification dates as calibration points for the parasite tree. Extensive testing using alternative substitution (with or without codon partitioning), clock, and tree models and subsets of genetic data determined that model choice or the exclusion of the ITS locus had little influence on tree topology and estimated divergence dates (SI Appendix, Table S5 ). Additional details regarding model priors and run settings can be found in SI Appendix. ",

Previous analyses of Bartonella host associations have shown that host-switching is common (30) , so a calibration approach that assumes strict cospeciation across the tree would not accurately reflect the evolutionary history of these bacteria. However, Bartonella lineages are broadly host-specific within orders (18) and host-switching is more frequent between closely related hosts (31) . We defined 15 host-associated Bartonella clades (Tables S5-S6 ) at relevant taxonomic scales below the order level to test the hypothesis that Bartonella lineages diversified with their hosts while accounting for frequent hostswitching that could occur within a host clade. We collated divergence dates for the most recent common ancestor uniting the host taxa of interest within each clade from available studies in the TimeTree database (http://timetree.org/), summarized by the estimated mean, 95% confidence intervals, and range of dates across studies (32) . We then correlated these mean host divergence dates with our estimated median divergence date of the associated Bartonella clade (Table S7) . A significant linear fit between these dates would support the hypothesis that Bartonella diversified within their hosts after colonization. To validate measurement of the divergence time for mammal-associated Bartonella clades with the ultrametric tree produced in BEAST, we also generated a calibrated timed phylogeny with the ML tree. Using the RelTime relative rate framework (33) within MEGA v10.0.5 (34) we generated a timed phylogeny using host clade divergence dates from TimeTree (Table S7) . We used confidence intervals (or ranges in the case of clade J) for the 15 host clade divergence dates as minimum and maximum divergence dates in RelTime. The program then calculated divergence dates on the tree using a maximum likelihood approach (33), producing mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals for clade dates that we could compare with the eubartonellae date estimated in BEAST. This analysis can confirm that the date estimation is robust to different approaches by comparing a calibration-based method on an existing tree to a method that relies on relaxed clock priors during tree estimation.

Specifically, we inspected the posterior support for the node and the posterior probability of the host order and ecozone at the node across all posterior trees. However, due to the large number of Bartonella lineages associated with Chiroptera in the database (n = 160) relative to those in other diverse orders (Rodentia, 87; Artiodactyla, 32; Carnivora, 21), we tested the influence of this sampling bias on uncertainty about ancestral states using stochastic character mapping of host orders and ecozones onto trees (35) . We wrote a custom R function to resample tips from the phylogenetic tree and perform stochastic character mapping on the pruned tree using the packages ape and phytools (36, 37) assuming an equal-rates model. The function ran 100 mapping simulations on each pruned tree and calculated the probability that Chiroptera and Palearctic were the inferred host order and ecozone at the node uniting eubartonellae. These states were chosen based on initial reconstructions from BEAST indicating them as ancestral traits. We performed this simulation using three resampling schemes: equalizing the number of tips associated with bats and rodents (n = 87), equalizing tips associated with bats, rodents, and artiodactyls (n = 32), and equalizing tips associated with bats, rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores (n = 21). Resampling schemes were run with 100 resampling iterations on the MCC tree and 10 resampling steps on 10 randomly sampled posterior trees. We summarized the resulting probability distributions by the mean and interquartile range (SI Appendix, Table S11 224 S12). Separate host order and ecozone networks were then built from these median transitions, and node-level properties including degree, out-degree, and betweenness centrality were calculated using the R package igraph (38) .",

Yet in all resampling scenarios, the median posterior probability that bats are the ancestral hosts of mammal-infecting eubartonellae exceeded 0.9 (SI Appendix, Table S11 ).

Specifically, this system could inform theory about how agents adapt to and diversify in hosts over time and the ecological conditions that lead to accidental infections and host-switching. Using a multi-faceted analytical approach, this study answered several key questions about the evolution of Bartonella bacteria. First, we found that the Bartonella genus began diversifying with mammals around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Our novel approach used a strong relaxed clock prior on the 16S rRNA locus based on substitution rates observed in bacterial symbionts of arthropods (17) while accounting for rate variation at eight other genetic loci to yield a highly supported phylogenetic tree with estimated divergence dates. Second, we showed that Bartonella clades diversified along with their mammalian hosts. Ancestral state reconstruction on the phylogenetic tree showed that Bartonella lineages tend to cluster by host taxonomic orders and this clustering was found to be significantly higher than random expectations using tip-association tests.",

Thus, calibrating divergence dates by relying on codivergence between host taxa would poorly reflect this history. Instead we initially avoided a calibration approach in favor of using a relaxed clock prior, then validated estimated divergence dates based on 15 radiation events within particular bat, rodent, ruminant, and marsupial host taxa. The Bartonella divergence dates correlate strongly with the host divergence dates, although with a widespread delay in the colonization of Bartonella within a clade (Fig. 2) . While it is possible that this delay in Bartonella colonization is associated with the divergence date estimation approach and bacteria diverged immediately along with their hosts, we suspect the delay reflects some biological reality. According to Manter's rules (56, 57) , parasites evolve more slowly than their hosts due to the relatively uniform environments they experience within a host. This slow evolution may help to explain rampant Bartonella host-switching between related hosts in the tree, since from a parasite's perspective the intracellular environments of phylogenetically similar hosts are unlikely to have significantly changed. Despite these inherent delays, the clustering of Bartonella strains with host orders and particular clades within those orders along with the correlation of divergence times strongly suggest a shared evolutionary history between Bartonella strains and their hosts, although a more complicated one than simple cospeciation.",

As the two most speciose groups of mammals, they could be expected to host diverse parasites according to Eichler's rule (58) , which predicts positive covariance between host and parasite diversity. While more studies will need to be done to explicitly test patterns of host and Bartonella diversity while accounting for sampling biases, it associated clades in the growing diversity of trypanosomes, Hamilton and others hypothesized that bats may have been highly influential in the geographic spread of the T. cruzi clade and host-switching to other mammals (14) . This 'bat-seeding' hypothesis has continued to gain support since it was proposed with the discovery of diverse lineages in the T. cruzi clade in bats globally (12, 41) . Similar patterns have been noted in malarial parasites (Haemosporida), wherein the transition from sauropsids into mammals likely occurred only once, with bats being a possible bridge to other mammals (13, 65) . In light of the results of this study and the patterns in other systems, we contend that the 'bat-seeding' hypothesis may apply more widely among mammalian parasites. Our approach using comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, estimation of divergence times, and ancestral reconstruction of host associations could be applied to understand the evolutionary radiation and host-switching patterns of these parasites, and potentially the role that bats have played in their diversification. between the outgroup (Brucella abortus) and between mammalian orders and arthropods have been removed for clarity.

We further assessed the nature of transitions between hosts and ecozones by performing additional stochastic character mapping simulations on posterior trees followed by network analysis of state transitions. Host orders and ecozones were simulated with phytools over 1000 posterior sampled trees with an equalrates model. The number of state transitions were then summarized over all 1000 simulations by the median and 95% credible intervals, ignoring state transitions with a median of zero (SI Appendix,",

However, our approach has substantially altered the order of the deep branches within the phylogeny, including the delineation of five distinct Bartonella clades restricted to bats. Additional details regarding revisions to the Bartonella tree topology and clock rate estimates for sequenced loci can be found in SI Appendix. Beyond a revised phylogeny, our approach demonstrated that bartonellae are ancient and supports the hypothesis that the genus diversified with mammals. We confirm that the genus first evolved as a symbiont of arthropods, represented by the species B. apis, B. tamiae and the ant symbiont Candidatus Tokpelaia hoelldoblerii, before transitioning to a parasitic lifestyle in mammals. These mammal-infecting eubartonellae (excluding B. apis and B. tamiae) began diversifying 62 million years ago (mya; 95% HPD: 40-90), near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary 66 mya (Fig. 1; SI Appendix, Fig. S6).

This fits with the classification of bats within the clade Laurasiatheria and previous reconstructions of chiropteran biogeography which found that extant bats may have originated in Eurasia(40). However, the inference of the geographic origin of eubartonellae is less certain when host sampling bias was accounted for in the stochastic character mapping analysis.The median posterior probability for a Palearctic origin of eubartonellae ranged from 0.63 to 0.77 across all resampling scenarios (SI Appendix,",

The switch from symbiont to mammal parasite could then have occurred early in the evolution of mammals. There is evidence that ancestors of extant mammalian ectoparasites implicated as Bartonella vectors (48-50) were already present by the end of the Cretaceous, including sand flies (51), fleas (1), sucking lice (52), bed bugs (2), and hippoboscoid flies (53). Based on available evidence, the colonization of mammals by Bartonella bacteria may have occurred via hematophagous vector, possibly parasitizing early bats. An ancestral relationship with bats is supported by recent detection of B. tamiae in bat flies and bat spleens(54,55), suggesting that this species can opportunistically colonize bats from arthropods even today. The initial transmission may have occurred through contamination of skin with arthropod feces containing bacteria, direct consumption of an infected arthropod, or some other unknown route(4).

While endemic Bartonella infections are likely maintained by transmission by specialist ectoparasite vectors, generalist vectors could target the most abundant species in the community (e.g., rodents or bats) and occasionally infest alternative hosts, resulting in opportunities for accidental Bartonella infections in phylogenetically distant hosts over evolutionary time(31). Reconstructing some of these ancient host-switching dynamics would require knowledge of ancestral ectoparasite associations and the interactions of hosts and their ectoparasites within communities.Finally, bats were identified as the most probable ancestral host of eubartonellae in mammals even after accounting for sampling bias in the database. The fact that bats can fly would have hypothetically increased their dispersal ability during their early diversification. This is exemplified by numerous long-distance colonization events: from mainland Africa to Madagascar by seven different extant bat families, including the endemic Myzopodidae; from Australia to New Zealand by the family Mystacinidae; and from mainland North America to Hawaii by Lasiurus cinereus(59). The dispersal of bats to distant landmasses during the early diversification of extant mammals could have played a role in the importance of bats as sources of Bartonella infection to other hosts. We also note that bats appear to be highly tolerant of infections, especially of intracellular bacteria and viruses(60), showing few signs of disease and unique immune responses compared to other mammals(7,(61)(62)(63). Such patterns in extant bats may have ancient origins linked with their ability to fly(64) and thus bats may have been ideal hosts for the early colonization of mammals by arthropod-borne bartonellae.The importance of bats in the evolutionary diversification of mammal parasites has been discussed by other authors working in distinct systems. One of these groups are the Trypanosoma parasites that include T. cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease. Observing the broad distribution of bat",
