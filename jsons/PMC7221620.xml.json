            "text": "The oxidation of active methylene groups with selenium dioxide was reported in the open literature in 1932 [1]. While studies of the eponymous SeO2-mediated oxidation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] and companion chemistry occupied Harry Lister Riley (1899\u20131986) [9] for a relatively short period, the 1932 publication [1] had perhaps the deepest impact among his more than four decades of publications. The role of selenium oxides as oxidants of organic compounds was apparently surmised in the late 19th century owing to the presence of the congeneric selenium oxide as an impurity in fuming sulfuric acid [10], yet it was the systematic studies of Riley and coworkers with purified SeO2 that captured the imagination of synthetic chemists. The impact was torrential\u2014at least 10 overviews and summaries appeared in the ensuing dozen years [11], and a chapter in Organic Reactions (1948) listed >500 distinct substrates that had been subjected to reaction with SeO2 [10]\u2014all of which highlight the unmet needs for synthetic transformations that were fulfilled by the advent of SeO2-mediated oxidation. Riley oxidation has found enduring use with application to diverse substrates, as recounted in broad-ranging reviews [10,11,12,13]. Our focus here is to comprehensively review the use of Riley oxidation in a key transformation leading to synthetic analogues of the native photosynthetic pigments. The scope of this targeted review covers the totality of all work on this topic since inception, which was in 2001.",

Shown alongside the native pigments are the structures of synthetic chlorin (1, 2) and bacteriochlorin (3, 4) analogues. Each analogue contains a gem-dimethyl group in the pyrroline ring, and each synthesis begins with gem-dimethyl substituted precursors. Direct hydrogenation of, or cycloaddition to, a porphyrin to form the chlorin or bacteriochlorin also constitutes de novo synthesis, but the inclusion of a gem-dimethyl group via the precursors affords the following advantages: (1) achieves complete control over the location of the pyrroline ring relative to the other substituents in the macrocycle, (2) imparts resistance to adventitious oxidation that leads to the less saturated macrocycle (i.e., the chlorin or porphyrin), and (3) is compatible with formation of the isocyclic ring (ring E). On the other hand, the de novo construction of gem-dimethyl substituted hydroporphyrins entails a considerable synthetic effort [15], the simplification of which is an ongoing effort in our lab.",

            "text": "Two prior routes to gem-dimethyl-substituted hydroporphyrins have employed Riley oxidation as a key step in the synthesis. Jacobi and co-workers developed a route to dihydrodipyrrin-dicarboxaldehydes, wherein the aldehyde attached to the pyrrole is installed by the use of trimethyl orthoformate, and the aldehyde attached to the pyrroline is formed by Riley oxidation of a 1-methyldihydrodipyrrin (5) (Scheme 1, left). Acid-catalyzed reaction of a dihydrodipyrrin-dicarboxaldehyde (6) and a dipyrromethane-dicarboxylic acid (7, which undergoes didecarboxylation in situ) affords the corresponding chlorin (8) [16,17,18]. In our work, analogous Riley oxidation of a 1-methyldihydrodipyrrin (9) affords the dihydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde (10). Conversion of the latter to the corresponding dimethyl acetal (11) followed by head-to-tail self-condensation under acid catalysis affords the bacteriochlorin (12) (Scheme 1, right) [19,20]. In both synthetic routes, the gem-dimethyl group of the dihydrodipyrrin is conveyed to the pyrroline ring (ring D) of the corresponding chlorin. The pre-installation of the gem-dimethyl group in the dihydrodipyrrin enables the presence of peripheral substituents, and the positions of such substituents relative to ring D, to be set at very early stages in the synthesis. The specific location of such substituents relative to the pyrroline ring can alter the spectroscopic features, physicochemical features, and supramolecular phenomena exhibited by the resulting macrocycles.",

Double-ring closure of each affords the model chlorophyll (2) [21] or bacteriochlorophyll (4) [22], respectively (Scheme 2). The resulting macrocycles share the full hydrocarbon skeleton with the native tetrapyrrole photosynthetic pigments, exemplified by chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a. The double-ring closure is carried out as a one-flask procedure, wherein multiple chemical transformations occur\u2014including Nazarov cyclization, electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr), and elimination of methanol\u2014albeit in unknown sequence. For a definition of all abbreviations employed herein, please see the Section entitled Abbreviations. Again, the desired array of substituents in the target macrocycle is established at a very early stage of the synthesis, upon creation and/or modification of the dihydrodipyrrins for synthesis of the bacteriochlorophyll model compounds (4), or with the dihydrodipyrrin and dipyrromethane precursors to the chlorophyll model compounds (2).

The general structures are shown in Chart 2. As stated for the analogous tetrahydrodipyrrins [23], a dihydrodipyrrin appears quite simple, but the appearance may be deceptive because the two different heterocycles (pyrrole, pyrroline) present quite distinct reactivity as follows: (1) the pyrrole contains up to three open sites for electrophilic substitution; (2) the imine of the pyrroline, and the methylidene linkage between the pyrrole and pyrroline, are susceptible to reduction and addition; (3) the imine nitrogen can coordinate to metals; and (4) the pyrrole is a weak acid, whereas the pyrroline is a weak base.",

The paper is divided into two main parts. Part 1 provides a representative summary of the various conditions that have been employed, some quite sporadically, in Riley oxidations of diverse substrates (beyond dihydrodipyrrins) over the years. This section aims to cover the scope of the conditions, but is not comprehensive with regards to the scope of substrates and applications, for which other reviews are available [10,11,12,13]. Part 2 provides a review of all cases of dihydrodipyrrins subjected to Riley oxidation including structures, reaction conditions, and yields. One known dihydrodipyrrin is subjected to several reaction conditions identified in part 1. An interlude between the two parts provides an overview of mechanisms. Some insights have emerged from this comparative analysis, although a solution to the limited yields of the Riley oxidation with dihydrodipyrrins remains obscure.",

A key issue here is the use of additives or other variations to the reaction conditions. While benzeneseleninic anhydride is not the same as SeO2, owing to the remarkable observations of Barton and coworkers, one set of examples is included. Barton and co-workers found the reaction of 17 and benzeneseleninic anhydride afforded 18 in 42% yield and the 2-selenide derivative 19 in 20% yield [24]. The addition of 3.0 equiv of indole (20) as a scavenger for Se(II) caused formation of 18 in almost quantitative yield, the complete absence of the unwanted derivative 19, and the formation of the indole-trapped phenylselenide 21 (Scheme 3). Reaction with dihydropyran (22) as a scavenging agent afforded similar results along with formation of the dihydropyran-phenylselenide adduct (23). An upshot of this result is that the selenium product likely reacts with the organic product, an undesirable process that can be thwarted by the addition of a scavenging agent. The following examples focus almost exclusively on additives in reactions with SeO2.",

On account of the rate-accelerating effect of pyridine and perhaps also the limited stability of dihydrodipyrrins under acidic conditions [17,26], pyridine was added to the Riley oxidation of a set of dihydrodipyrrins. Thus, dihydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde 24 afforded the dihydrodipyrrin-dicarboxaldehyde 6 in 61%\u201371% yield, and increased the yield for the conversion of 25 to 26 to 37% (Scheme 4, top). For those substrates with acid-labile groups, only a few oxidations were successful [27,28]. The reaction of 27 with SeO2 gave a mixture of compounds (28\u201332) owing to hydrolysis of the ketal (Scheme 4, middle). However, the addition of a slight stoichiometric excess of pyridine with respect to the SeO2 resulted in the isolation of 28 as a major product in 42% yield (Scheme 4, bottom) [29].",

The N-oxide substrates 83 and 84 did not give a substantially higher yield of the corresponding aldehydes 85 and 86 upon Riley oxidation versus that of 78 and 79; however, for the N-oxide, a monoaldehyde was formed to the exclusion of any dialdehyde 87 (Scheme 9). In this case, the improved reaction selectivity and yield of the monoaldehyde with N-oxide substrates must stem in part, if not wholly, from the greater ease of formation of the corresponding enamine, although the greater stability of the heterocycle-N-oxide versus the parent heterocycle toward indiscriminate oxidation (e.g., removal of an electron from the heterocyclic nucleus) as opposed to site-specific SeO2-mediated oxidation cannot be discounted.",

The reaction can be carried out catalytically by the addition of stoichiometric oxidants such as TBHP or O2, both of which are desirable from economic, health, and environmental standpoints, as well as easing the challenges of purification. A method for benzylic oxidation that employed O2 in excess in conjunction with catalytic amounts of nitric oxide and Se or SeO2 was applied to a series of 2-alkylnaphthalenes (96\u201398), affording the corresponding naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (99) (Scheme 11, top) [44]. The same reaction with picolines 100 and 101 afforded the isonicotinic acid (102) and picolinic acid (103), respectively [44]. In both reaction sets, the yields spanned a considerable range, from 25% to 80% for 99, and 38% and 94% for 103 and 102, respectively.

A first set of examples includes conversion of 2,6-lutidine (104) and neocuproine (106) to the respective products 105 and 107 (Scheme 12, a) [45]. The oxidation of camphor (108) and derivatives by SeO2 is often sluggish (15 h\u201314 days), whereas the microwave-assisted process shortened the reaction time to 75 min and produced the corresponding product (109) in good yield (Scheme 12, b) [46]. The microwave-assisted SeO2 oxidation of 1,2-diarylethanones (110, representing 18 compounds) to form the diones 111 also shortened the reaction time from 8 h to 30\u201390 s (Scheme 12, c) [47]. The nature of the aryl groups in 110 included considerable diversity in Ar1 (= X-phenyl, where X includes \u2013H, \u2013F, \u2013Cl, \u2013Br, \u2013CH3, \u2013OCH3, \u2013SCH3; 2- and 4-positions only) and also Ar1 = thiophen-2-yl, but was more limited for Ar2 (= X-phenyl, where X includes \u2013H, \u2013NO2, \u2013Cl, and \u2013OCH3; 2- and 4-positions only). In addition, the inclusion of urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) and application of microwave-assisted SeO2 oxidation of alkenes (112) shortened the reaction time to 40 s and increased the yield of the corresponding \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes (113) (Scheme 12, d) [48]. The substituents accommodated in the R group of 112 include an ethyl group terminated with \u2013OH, \u2013OAc, or \u2013Br; an oxo group; an ethylidene acetal; a 2-acetoxyethylidene group; and an acetoxymethyl-substituted oxiranyl group [48]. More recently, closed-vessel microwave (CVMW) irradiation accelerated the SeO2 oxidation of 1-tetralones (114) to 1,2-naphthoquinones (115) to the remarkably brief period of 1 s, compared with 4\u20137 h upon refluxing in acetic acid (Scheme 12, e) [49].",

(Note: the authors of this review believe that the cited contribution likely is that of H. L. Riley with typographical replacement of A for L. While the aforementioned publications in Organic Syntheses list no information concerning institutional affiliation, our supposition is posited on (i) familiarity with typewriters and typed print from that era, wherein A could be easily misread for L; (ii) the topic; (iii) publication in 1935, so soon after the original discovery; and (iv) the absence of any other publications concerning chemistry by an H. A. Riley in the period 1920\u20131950 as concluded from a search in Web of Science across all databases; moreover, there are only six publications to A. R. Gray, suggesting the latter likely was a research group member with H. L. Riley.) The balanced reaction for Riley oxidation of acetophenone to form phenylglyoxal is provided below (Equation (1)), where the inorganic products are elemental selenium and water.

First, that \u201ccommercial selenious acid (129 g, 1 mol) may be used in place of the mixture of selenium dioxide and water\u201d. Second, referring to the mixture of SeO2 and water in dioxane, \u201cthe mixture is heated to 50\u201355 \u00b0C and stirred until the solid has gone into solution\u201d, whereupon acetophenone is then added. Third, at the end of the reaction, that \u201cthe hot solution is decanted from the precipitated selenium\u201d. The first and second statements highlight the question concerning the nature of the oxidizing species, while the third points to the heterogeneity of the process regardless of whether there is a homogeneous solution at the outset. The oxidation of acetophenone to form phenylglyoxal (Figure 1) was carried out by one of us following the protocol of Riley and Gray (except at 1/100th scale and at 1.0 rather than 1.7 M). The presence of water is required to achieve a homogeneous solution with SeO2 in dioxane. A black precipitate forms early in the reaction upon refluxing in the presence of acetophenone. Note that acetophenone is colorless, whereas phenylglyoxal is light yellow. The same reaction entirely at room temperature did not yield an initial homogeneous solution, but did afford a red precipitate.",

The subsequent intramolecular [2,3]-sigmatropic shift of II gives III, which, upon elimination, generates IV. The latter could proceed via reductive elimination or by hydrolysis followed by redox transformations.Route II begins with imine\u2013enamine tautomerization of I. The enamine of I reacts with SeO2 to generate intermediate V, and then Pummerer-like rearrangement via intermediate VI yields VII.

Several points [60] germane to any contemplation of mechanism are as follows: (1) SeO2 in the solid state is a polymer; (2) SeO2 hydrates reversibly to give selenous acid (H2SeO3; known as selenious acid in the older literature); (3) SeO2 is insoluble in many organic solvents, whereas selenous acid is more soluble; (4) water is often added to the reaction mixture [1] to \u201cdissolve\u201d SeO2; (5) the common oxidation states of selenium are \u22122, 0, +2, +4, and +6; and (6) elemental selenium forms multiple allotropes (red, black, grey) including ring species (e.g., cyclo-Se8) akin to those for elemental sulfur.",

For the mechanisms shown in Scheme 13, the eliminated selenium byproducts (Se or HSeOH)\u2014often not displayed explicitly in reports wherein mechanisms are proffered\u2014are formal entities, and in fact, relatively little data are typically available concerning the composition of the selenium products, which is understandable given the focus by synthetic chemists on the organic product of the reaction. In his first paper, Riley described the appearance, recovery, and regeneration of the precipitated selenium species [1], and a selenium-containing insoluble orange, red, or black film inside the flask upon quenching the Riley oxidation (by addition of water or base) has been noted by many, including Jacobi and coworkers, who performed the first Riley oxidations of hydrodipyrrins [17], the focus of the present review. Early reviews described reports of complexes of organic substrates and selenium species in the precipitates, as well as controversies about mechanism [10]. The complexity of oxoselenium chemistry precludes simple correlation of selenium products with proposed organic mechanisms; in this regard, a formal species such as HSeOH could in principle undergo reaction, disproportionation, or combination with SeO2 or other species to form polyselenides and/or other products (as one hypothetical example, HSeOH + SeO2 \u2192 H2SeO3 + Se); similar reactions may occur with SeO2 (or oligomeric species thereof) with O\u2013Se\u2013OH moieties attached to an intermediate (e.g., III or V). If multiple selenium oxide species are present, one or more of a multiplicity of pathways may prevail, particularly under various conditions\u2014as one explicit example, acidic conditions that cause protonation of a heterocyclic nitrogen atom may shift a reaction toward one pathway that is not a significant conduit for reactant to product under neutral conditions, and vice versa. Thus, the three mechanisms displayed in Scheme 13 are shown here for completeness as well as consideration of the results obtained upon Riley oxidation of diverse substrates.",

Concerning solvent, dioxane and DMF were usually employed. In some cases, pyridine was also added as a base. Jacobi and coworkers reported that the use of sublimed SeO2 and a \u201cwet\u201d solvent did not substantially increase the yield, and even a trace amount of water accelerated decomposition [17]. Concerning temperature, most reactions were carried out at room temperature. On the other hand, the Jacobi and Lash groups often performed the oxidation for several hours at room temperature, and then at 80 \u00b0C for 15 min (entries 35, 36a, 37, 38, 39b, 40b, 41b, 42, and 43). No examples are known of reactions at a lower temperature (<0 \u00b0C). The most significant insights concern structural effects. The interpretations drawn from the results in the table must be provisional in many cases given that, often, only single instances are available for comparison, and the synthetic work was carried out at a range of scales with various purification methods by different experimentalists. With those caveats, the insights to date include the following:A pyrroline N-oxide provides superior results (entry 1 versus 2, 79% versus 0%).Two 1-methyltetrahydrodipyrrin-N-oxides (entries 1 and 3) could be converted to the corresponding aldehyde, but neither product was subsequently converted to a hydroporphyrin. Methods for N-deoxygenation will likely be required to do so.\u03b2-Alkyl versus \u03b2-aryl groups afford comparable results (entry 6 versus 4, ~40%; and 26 versus 27, 31%).An aza-spirohexyl group in lieu of a gem-dimethyl has no adverse effect (entries 7,8 versus 4; ~40% for both; the former are dimethyl acetals).\u03b2,\u03b2-Dialkyl or \u03b2,\u03b2-annulated arenes afford comparable results (entries 9, 11 and 12; ~60%).A tert-butyl ester and ethyl ester at the 9-position afford comparable results (entries 9 and 12; ~60%).A pre-existing aldehyde group on the pyrrole unit survives intact and causes no adverse effect (entries 13 and 39\u201343; all yields >60%).The presence of a single aryl-substituted pyrrole gives yields of 22%\u201357% (entries 14\u201316).A lone p-bromophenyl group on the pyrrole unit affords acceptable results (entry 16, 38%), as does a p-iodophenyl group (entry 15, 57%), whereas a lone bromine atom on the pyrrole unit results in failure (entry 17, 0%) unless the pyrrole is stabilized with an ester substituent (entry 25, 37%; a dimethyl acetal) or a pyrrole N-tosyl group (entry 3, 43%; also a pyrroline N-oxide). Halopyrroles lacking stabilizing (e.g., electron-withdrawing) substituents are known to be unstable [66].A meso-alkyl or meso-aryl group affords comparable results (entries 19 and 20; 63% and 65%; the former is a dimethyl acetal).A meso-alkyl group has no apparent adverse effect (entries 42 and 43 versus 39a; >60%).The position of the gem-dimethyl group at the 2,2- versus 3,3-site has relatively little adverse effect (entry 23 versus 4; 25% for the dimethyl acetal versus 32 or 40% for the aldehyde).The presence of larger 2,2-dialkyl groups is satisfactory (entries 29 and 30; yields >50%, the latter is a dimethyl acetal).In one case, a Z-isomer gives the Z-isomer (entry 29, 57%), whereas the E-isomer gave a ~4:1 mixture of the Z- and E-products (entry 30; 51% and 12%; both dimethyl acetals).In another case, the Z- and E-isomers individually each give a mixture of the Z and E products (entries 31 and 32; total yields >55%; all dimethyl acetals). In this and the preceding example, the 2-position substituents are bulky (alkyl or phenyl) groups.2,2-Diphenyl substituents afford both the Z- and E-isomers in comparable quantities and nearly twice the yield of the 2,2-dimethyl unit (entry 31 versus 18; 55% total versus 30%).In yet another case, the Z-isomer gives a 5:1 mixture of the Z and E products (entry 40a).The remarkably high yields of 99% (entries 13 and 40a) are hard to reconcile with yields of ~60% for nearly identical substrates (entries 12 and 39).The presence of a single ester substituent on the pyrrole unit affords good yield, whereas the fully unsubstituted pyrrole does not afford product (entry 34 versus 45; 47% versus 0%; the former is a dimethyl acetal).The presence of an unsubstituted pyrrole affords products that are not stable or are formed in low yield (entries 44, 45; 5.8% for the bacteriochlorin product of the former, 0% for the latter).",

In organic chemistry, selenium finds its most widespread use in the SeO2-mediated conversion of a methyl group to the corresponding aldehyde group, which originated with the pioneering work of Harry Lister Riley in the early 1930s. In tetrapyrrole chemistry, Riley oxidation provides an essential transformation of 1-methylhydrodipyrrins to the corresponding hydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde or dimethyl acetal thereof. The comprehensive review here shows that the Riley oxidation has considerable tolerance for substituents in the pyrrole and pyrroline ring of the dihydrodipyrrin, although in general, the yields rarely exceed 70%, with yields of 30%\u201340% often more typical. Hardly any data are available concerning the nature of the side reactions, and byproducts formed, that account for the low yields. In context, most substrates examined to date for Riley oxidations have contained ketones or alkenes rather than heterocycles or imines, as described herein. Particular structural limitations that cause failure of the Riley oxidation with hydrodipyrrins include the absence of any substituents in the pyrrole nucleus, or the presence of a lone bromine atom. On the other hand, a single ester or even aryl substituent in the pyrrole nucleus suffices to give a successful oxidation. Such structural limitations impact the scope of available hydroporphyrins. The survey in part I here of a broad range of substrates reveals diverse conditions beyond those considered for the classic Riley oxidation, namely SeO2 in 1,4-dioxane. Many observations that bear on mechanism have been reported over the years, but fundamental mechanistic studies (which largely petered out in the latter part of the 20th century) may warrant renewed investigation, particularly in the context of the available diversity of reaction conditions. Most such reaction conditions have not been applied to the hydrodipyrrins, which may present new synthetic opportunities as the Riley oxidation nears its century mark.",
