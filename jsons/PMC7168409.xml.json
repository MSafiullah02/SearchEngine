            "text": "The possibility that Plasmodium parasites have developed ways to interfere with host cellular functions is an interesting one, particularly in light of how long this parasite has had to evolve. Plasmodium has a complex system for the export of membrane proteins to the red blood cell (RBC) surface (Marti et al., 2004) and also secretes non\u2010membrane\u2010associated proteins from micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules (three types of specialized secretory organelles) into the RBC, which are essential for merozoite invasion (Binder and Kim, 2004). Whether these parasites secrete proteins capableof interfering with host ubiquitination in nucleated cells remains to be determined. As a eukaryote, Plasmodium possesses its own post\u2010translational modifying machinery, including a ubiquitin\u2010proteasome pathway. This pathway has yet to receive its due attention for therapeutic development, with the exception of a recent publication that reports toxicity of proteasome inhibitors for Plasmodium falciparum (Lindenthal et al., 2005). Although the complete sequencing of the P. falciparum genome has revealed several putative Ub C\u2010terminal hydrolases, there has been no evidence of expression and function for any of these gene products. The assignment of a putative deubiquitinating enzyme based solely on sequence similarity is precarious, as the enzyme may prefer to react with Ub\u2010like modifiers, rather than with Ub itself (Hemelaar et al., 2004; Misaghi et al., 2006). Examples of enzymes with dual specificity, for example, reactive with both Ub as well as with Nedd8, have been reported (Wada et al., 1998; Linghu et al., 2002). Here we identify a P. falciparum protein, homologous to human UCH37, which we designate PfUCH54, with apparent deubiquitinating as well as deNeddylating activity.",

Upon attack by the target enzyme, an irreversible thioether bond is formed between enzyme and probe. These interactions can then be detected by immunoprecipitation or by immunoblotting against the epitope tag (Fig. 1).",

Consequently, such probes are expected to react only if the Plasmodium\u2010derived modifiers are sufficiently conserved to allow cross\u2010reaction. A sequence alignment and consensus analysis of P. falciparum SUMO, Nedd8 and Ub modifiers with their human counterparts is shown in Fig. S1. ISG15 homologues have not been found outside of vertebrates so this alignment is not included. A SUMO\u2010related sequence is found in P. falciparum and shares an average of 50% amino acid sequence identity with the four human SUMO variants (48% SUMO1, 53% SUMO2, 51% SUMO3, 50% SUMO4). Likewise, a Nedd8\u2010like protein which is 52% identical to its human counterpart is also present.

We treated the cultures with saponin to release the schizonts and to remove any unparasitized red blood cells (uRBCs).

In both cases, addition of N\u2010ethyl\u2010maleimide (NEM) eliminated this reactivity, evidence of an enzymatic mechanism that involves a cysteine residue at the active site. Conversely, the SUMO and ISG15 probes failed to react with the parasite lysate (data not shown).

The quality of the mass spectra obtained and the extent of sequence coverage allowed robust and unambiguous identification (Fig. 3). Although the gene designation suggests DUB activity, as determined by sequence similarity with known mammalian UCH\u2010type enzymes, these data are the first evidence that this gene product is both expressed and functional. For this reason, the identified protein was named PfUCH54, for P. falciparum Ub C\u2010terminal hydrolase with a molecular mass of 54 kDa. The discrepancy in predicted versus observed size of the protein (54 kDa versus \u223c100 kDa) can possibly be explained by aggregation in the course of electrophoresis. It has been established that consecutive repetitions of a single amino acid, such as glutamine or alanine, can lead to protein aggregations (Ravikumar et al., 2002). We believe that the homopolymeric region of asparagines embedded in the PfUCH54 sequence may cause the observed aggregation. Peptides matching PfUCH54 were also recovered from 65 kDa and 40 kDa regions of the gel. The 65 kDa mass is consistent with a 54 kDa protein with a 10 kDa probe attachment, while the 40 kDa fragment most likely represents a degradation product. Mass spectral quality for these polypeptides was inferior to that of the 100 kDa band, hence, the latter data are presented in Fig. 3.",

A sequence alignment of these two proteins, in addition to two other well\u2010characterized human DUBs, UCH\u2010L1 and UCH\u2010L3, revealed only moderate sequence identity but conservation of all active site residues, consistent with the observed DUB activity of the parasitic protein (Fig. 4A). The predicted active residues for PfUCH54 are Cys145, His220 and Asp235. The insertion of a homopolymeric asparagine stretch in the parasite sequence is common to many expressed proteins (Pizzi and Frontali, 2001) in P. falciparum. Although the function of these low\u2010complexity homopolymeric regions is not known, they may serve as sites of interaction with other proteins or may expand the parasite's antigenic repertoire, thereby contributing to immune evasion (Schofield, 1991). As the crystal structure of UCH\u2010L3 has been solved (Johnston et al., 1997; Misaghi et al., 2005) and as the structure of UCH37, the closest PfUCH54 homologue, is predicted to be very similar (Kelley et al., 2000), we prepared a threaded model of PfUCH54 based on that of UCH\u2010L3 (Fig. 4B). The predicted structure of the PfUCH54 insertions were calculated using ROSETTA (Bystroff and Shao, 2002) and manually inserted into the final model (Guex and Peitsch, 1997). We were encouraged to see that the three major insertions in the parasitic protein sequence (shown in green in the model) are unlikely to interfere with the predicted architecture of the catalytic site (active cysteine residue shown in blue), as was confirmed by experiment (see Fig. 5). If these homopolymeric amino acid stretches serve a function, it is likely one not directly related to the protein's enzymatic activity.",

Furthermore, a similar shift was also observed with the Nedd8\u2010vinylsulphone (VS) probe. Based on reactivity with these probes, enzymatic activity is inferred (Kattenhorn et al., 2005; Schlieker et al., 2005; Misaghi et al., 2006). Binding to both Ub\u2010VME and Nedd8\u2010VS were entirely blocked upon addition of NEM. Specificity was further substantiated by the failure of the catalytically inactive mutated protein to be modified by either probe. These data demonstrate the requirements for the cysteine residue for reactivity, a hallmark of DUB activity. In addition to the polypeptide that exhibits mobility shifts upon reaction with the probe, each sample contains two additional prominent polypeptides that do not react with the probe. Because these polypeptides are recovered via the C\u2010terminal epitope tag, they must correspond to N\u2010terminal truncations of the primary translation product. Based on the location of additional methionine residues at positions consistent with the observed size of these polypeptides, we propose that they derive from the use of alternative translation start sites (indicated in Fig. 3).",

Differences in the ubiquitin\u2010proteasome system have been successfully used for diagnosis of parasitic diseases (Telles et al., 2003). The ubiquitin\u2010proteasome pathway is ancient and has been conserved throughout evolution (Catic and Ploegh, 2005), and the dynamic addition and removal of Ub is central to a wide variety of eukaryotic cellular processes in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. The many effects of ubiquitination render the enzymes that act on Ub crucial to proper cellular function and survival, a possible target for development of methods to handicap pathogens. The evolutionary distance between the parasite and its host may have resulted in differences in enzyme structure sufficient to allow selective inhibition, with the core function of the enzyme remaining conserved. Interference with the ubiquitin\u2010proteasome pathway has been successfully targeted in cancer therapy (Voorhees and Orlowski, 2006) but has been largely overlooked within infectious disease, particularly with regard to diseases of significant public health importance, such as malaria. Indeed, interference with protein degradation in P. falciparum, by blocking proteasome function, results in growth inhibition and toxicity to the parasite (Gantt et al. 1998; Lindenthal et al., 2005) and validates this pathway as a legitimate drug target. Given the variety of molecules that mediate this branch of the ubiquitination pathway, more specific and elegant therapies might be developed by targeting individual components of the processing cascade, rather than by indiscriminately blocking the proteasome itself. The data presented here establish the expression and functionality of the enzyme PfUCH54, both as a deubiquitinating and as a deNeddylating agent and provide the first experimental evidence that these enzyme families are active in P. falciparum.",

Although the alignment of UCH\u2010L3 with PfUCH54 does not show a high level of identity between the two proteins, putative active site amino acids reside within highly conserved sequence blocks. The dual specificity observed for PfUCH54 does not allow us to state with confidence whether its primary function is to target Ub\u2010modified or Nedd8\u2010modified proteins. Nedd8's role, as far as is known, is restricted to the modification of cullins, which are part of the SCF\u2010type Ub ligases involved in cell cycle control (Chiba and Tanaka, 2004). It is possible that PfUCH54 may contribute to regulation of both Ub and Nedd8 conjugation in P. falciparum. The Nedd8 reactivity of PfUCH54 is of particular interest given that mammalian and parasitic Nedd8 share only 52% identity. Nonetheless, there are three distinct blocks of conserved sequence (aa 5\u201311, 42\u201350, 71\u201376; see Fig. S1), which suggests that these regions of the protein are the critical components for proper folding and function.",

These proteins are either assembled or secreted into the host cell's cytoplasm where they interfere with the Ub pathway. A catalytically active truncation of UL36, the major tegument protein of herpes simplex virus\u20101 (HSV\u20101), is able to cleave polyubiquitin chains (Kattenhorn et al., 2005) and a related activity is conserved across the Herpesviridae (Schlieker et al., 2005). Likewise, C. trachomatis encodes two recently identified proteins with deubiquitinating activity, ChlaDUB1 and ChlaDUB2 (Misaghi et al., 2006). Homologues to these enzymes are not present in non\u2010pathogenic Chlamydia spp., an observation that supports the idea that these proteins may contribute to pathogenicity. Additional examples of proteins with deubiquitinating activity are also encoded by the SARS virus (Barretto et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005) as well as adenoviruses (Balakirev et al., 2002).",

In order for a parasite protein to be secreted, it must contain a specific N\u2010terminal signal sequence, otherwise known as a PEXEL domain (Binder and Kim, 2004; Marti et al., 2004). PfUCH54 lacks such a sequence, suggesting that its function is intraparasitic rather than host\u2010targeted. In addition, asparagine repeats which are commonly found throughout the P. falciparum genome are most commonly associated with parasite\u2010internal proteins (Singh et al., 2004). The presence of an asparagine\u2010rich region in PfUCH54 and the presence of a strongly HA\u2010Ub\u2010VME\u2010reactive band at 54 kDa in saponized parasites (Fig. 2A) suggest intraparasitic localization, a conclusion that would require further support by direct immunohistochemical analysis.",
