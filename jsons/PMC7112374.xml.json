            "text": "It has been discovered that the specially-created Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down has developed, in collaboration with industry, a novel polymeric material that demonstrates both moisture vapor permeability and chemical barrier properties [1]. This material is composed of two water-soluble polymers, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The selectively permeable material acts as a complete barrier towards toxic liquid, vapor and aerosol challenges yet allows moisture vapor to permeate, consequently representing a leap forward in the area of protective garment design. PVA can be considered a good host material for metals and semiconductors due to its good thermo-stability, chemical resistance and gas barrier properties [2]. Moreover, it contains a carbon backbone with hydroxyl groups attached to methane carbons; these hydroxyl groups can be a source of hydrogen bonding, hence assisting in the formation of polymer blends [3]. PEI is a hyper-branched amine polymer based on aziridine that has widespread applications in adhesives, coatings, textile manufacture, food packaging and cosmetics. PEI-treated cotton fabric has also been shown by the Dstl to be an excellent scavenger of sulfur mustard (HD) and soman (GD) vapors: this may be attributed to the nucleophilic amine groups, which can react with electrophilic species such as these [4].",

Many classes of POMs undergo rapid, reversible redox changes. They are of proven value in catalysis and other areas, partly because their extremely versatile redox potentials, acidities, polarities, solubilities, and other properties can be readily altered synthetically. Several types of POM change color when they are reduced. So, if a chemical warfare agent (CWA) with an oxidizable group, such as the sulfur atom in HD or possibly in VX, were to come into contact with the POM\u2013cream mixture, the POM would be reduced (the HD or VX oxidized). Because the reduced POM (POMRed) and the oxidized POM (POMOx) are different colors, the wearer would therefore have a facile indicator or warning of the presence of the CWA [10], [11], [12] \u2013 in other words, the agent would be detected by the POM\u2013cream mixture. If the POM in the cream catalyzes the O2-based oxidation and/or hydrolysis of the CWA, the POM\u2013cream could be catalytically decontaminating as well as detecting.",

In particular, the sizes and globular structural motifs of many POMs are similar, and in some cases nearly identical, to some water-soluble fullerene derivatives that exhibit fairly good anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity [13], [14], [15]. So far, various biological effects of POMs have been reported in terms of antitumor and antivirus activities [16], [17]. With regard to the antibacterial activity of POMs, we found that polyoxometalates with Keggin, lacunary Keggin, Wells-Dawson, double-Keggin, and Keggin-sandwich structures enhanced the antibacterial activity of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [18], Helicobacter pylori\n[19] and the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [20], [21], [22].",

An iodosobenzoate derivative of \u03b2-cyclodextrin (IBA-\u03b2CD) has been reported to catalyze the hydrolysis of soman and soman analogues [25]. In laboratory tests, these materials have demonstrated an ability to detoxify and destroy chemical agents and their simulants by breaking down their chemical structure; they have also been determined to be effective in destroying biological agent simulants including virus and bacteria spores in initial tests.

The SEM image of the Polymer/POM-8 hybrid film showed non-agglomerated, uniformly-distributed POM particles in the PVA/PEI film. The particles are of a spherical nature and seem to be nanosized, typically in the range of <20 nm (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, it was observed that the PVA/PEI blend exhibited a heterogeneous morphology with PEI polymers of micron size (<1 \u03bcm in diameter). This is characteristic of the facilitated transport mechanism, and clearly demonstrates that PEI functions efficiently as a carrier of vapor in the blend membrane. Chu and Yang investigated the effect of heat-treatment of a PVA membrane on water permeation through the membrane [28], and found that as the duration of heat-treatment increased, the density of the crosslinking formed by the condensation reaction between molecular chains increased, which resulted in a lower water permeation rate. This is attributable to the decrease in the pore size of PVA brought about by the increase in the crosslinking density. The TEM image of the Polymer/POM-8 hybrid solution showed non-agglomerated, scattered spherical POM particles at a low concentration, of sizes in the range of less than 20 nm (Fig. 1C). EDX analysis confirmed the existence of POM in the PVA/PEI matrix and qualitatively revealed the POM nanoparticle content.",

The thermal decomposition temperatures in the 300\u2013480 \u00b0C region were enhanced and in the 480\u2013550 \u00b0C region were weakened for the Polymer/POM hybrids, and these effects increased with increasing POM content. On the other hand, the char yield (Y\nc) in the degradation of the Polymer/POM hybrids was found to be proportional to the POM content. These results indicate that the thermal stability of the hybrid is influenced by the POM. This observation was further illustrated by the DTG curves obtained as a function of temperature. The weight loss below 200 \u00b0C is due to the degradation of water and small molecules, and the weight loss between 200 and 300 \u00b0C is attributed to the decomposition of hydrogen bonds between PVA and the PEI polymer. The weight loss in the intervals of 300\u2013450 \u00b0C and 450\u2013600 \u00b0C is attributed to the decomposition of the PEI and PVA units, respectively. Moreover, the maximum rate of weight loss of the PEI units (300\u2013450 \u00b0C) decreased with increasing POM content, while that of the PVA units (450\u2013600 \u00b0C) increased.

The major mass loss of the PVA/PEI blend in the 200\u2013430 \u00b0C region is attributed to the decomposition of the PVA\u2013PEI crosslinking chains. It can be seen that the DTG curves of the Polymer/POM hybrids exhibit three clear stages in the 200\u2013500 \u00b0C region, which can be attributed to the decomposition of the PEI (200\u2013320 \u00b0C), PVA (320\u2013430 \u00b0C), and PVA\u2013POM (430\u2013500 \u00b0C) units, respectively. The weight loss in the 430\u2013500 \u00b0C region, which is absent for the PVA/PEI blend, is mainly attributed to thermo-oxidative degradation of the PVA\u2013POM units. Moreover, the degradation temperature of the PEI units is lower and the PVA units are higher as compared with those of the PVA/PEI blend. The DTG curves show that the POM weakens the rate of the scission of PVA chains, while the same rate of the PEI chains is almost constant. On the basis of the above observations, it is thought that the PVA chains with hydroxyl groups could exert chelating behavior, and this may be due to the coordination between O and the POM. Consequently, the thermo-oxidative stability of the hybrids was influenced by the inclusion of the inorganic component. Such a consequence may be due to the enhancement of heat transfer as a result of the increase in mobility of the POM, which leads to an increase in scission in the PEI chains, resulting in a reduction in scission within the PVA chains.",

When CEES comes into contact with the Polymer/POM hybrids, the hybrids change from orange to blue in ca. 1 h at ambient temperature, exhibiting a potential HD-detecting capability. These Polymer/POM hybrids possess excellent antibacterial abilities: their antibacterial performance against Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and Gram-positive S. aureus and B. subtilis, was investigated by zone of inhibition testing, MIC and the plate-counting method, and the results showed that the Polymer/POM hybrids exhibit strong antibacterial activity against these bacteria.

The structure and negatively-charged anion characteristics of the POM are important in the antibacterial activity against Gram microbes. Further study is still needed in order to validate that these material systems are robust enough to survive the military environment, but the initial test results are very positive.
