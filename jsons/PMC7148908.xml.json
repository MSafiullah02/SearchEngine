LCCs in Korea can be categorized into two types from the view point of ownership; independent LCCs and dependent LCCs. First, independent LCCs refer to LCCs that are not owned by full service legacy carriers.4\nSecond, dependent LCCs refer to LCCs that are wholly-owned LCC subsidiaries of legacy carriers.5\nIn response to the emergence of the independent LCCs the two full service carriers established their own subsidiary LCCs, either replacing their prior services with them or flying under both legacy carrier brand and LCC brand. AAR replaced its service on some routes with its own LCC, Air Busan (ABL), and KAL operated under two-brand strategy through its subsidiary LCC, Jin Air (JNA).",

While non-scheduled air service carriers were only allowed to operate irregular flight services with aircraft, each having less than 80 seats, scheduled air service carriers could operate regular flight services with a license issued by a government aviation body. These restrictions on non-scheduled air service carriers, combined with irregular flights service, greatly limited their aircraft availability and selection (turboprop aircraft with less than 80 seats). Since 2005 a few independent LCCs had flown some city pair routes, but most of these were non-scheduled air service carriers subject to regulated market policy.

In Hotelling's linear city model with linear transport cost, each of duopolists differentiate their products in only one dimension, geographic location. Firms are located at the same point (minimal differentiation, i.e., perfect substitutes). Given the assumption of a quadratic transport costs, D'Apremont et al. (1979) show that duopolists with a single outlet locate at opposite ends of the linear markets. An example of the study of the circle model of spatial competition is Martinez-Giralt and Neven (1988). They developed spatial competition models allowing for competition from multiple outlets. In the circle model of spatial competition with duopolists, in equilibrium each firm positions its two outlets at the same point. As summarized in Borenstein and Netz (1999), theoretical models of spatial product differentiation suggest two possible polar cases regarding location competition outcomes: minimal differentiation in order to steal customers from rivals, and maximal differentiation in order to soften price competition with competitors.",

            "text": "Unlike perfectly competitive markets in which firms take prices as a given, the air travel industry is characterized by differentiated products. With differentiated products, competition has both price and non-price dimensions. Airline carriers choose not only prices, but also flight frequency and flight departure times. Spatial competition theory has been applied to airline studies such that airlines compete on departure times where the departure times of flights on a route can be interpreted as locations on a 24-h clock and the air traveler's preferred departure times are non-uniformly distributed, i.e., heterogeneous consumer's preferences. One of the studies in the airline industry literature related to departure flights scheduling competition is Borenstein and Netz (1999). In this study, passenger's transport costs are assumed to be quadratically related to departure flight times in minutes. They empirically test the relationship between the level of competition and spatial product differentiation using cross-sectional U.S airline 1975 (when fares were regulated) and 1986 (when fares were not regulated) data, respectively for a given number of flights on a route. According to their findings, airlines schedule their flights more closely to each other as competition increases for both periods. They also find that reductions in scheduling constraints increase differentiation in departure times after deregulation. Yetiskul and Kanafani (2010) also test location theory using cross-sectional U.S. airline 2005 data. They find that intense competition leads to less departure time differentiation. This tendency is lower in the presence of low cost carriers on a route. Salvanes, et al., (2005) empirically examine departure time differentiation in the Norwegian airline industry. When price is exogenous, they find evidence that an increase in competition on a route leads to a decrease in departure time differentiation.",

            "text": "In sum, spatial competition model in the airline industry suggests that when prices are set exogenously, then it follows that carriers would minimize departure time differentiation in the absence of price competition. On the other hand, carriers might increase departure time differentiation in order to soften price competition in the presence of potential intensive price competition. Deregulation in the Korean airline industry concentrated on eliminating regulatory barriers to entry, but did not lead to a huge reduction in the average fares due to unexpectedly introduced fuel surcharges on all domestic city-pair routes. With this small variations in fares within carriers, carriers would have engaged in non-price dimension competition. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether the pattern for scheduling departure flight times has changed since the 2008 Deregulation Act, and if so, the estimated effects differ depending on the types of routes: the Jeju island routes (leisure type) and the inland routes (business type).",

The route-specific profitability would drive carriers to schedule flight times either more closely to or farther from each other. On a route with higher profitability as exogenous, a carrier would have a greater incentive to schedule flight times closer to each other's flights, drawing passengers off from the most nearby flights.

Interestingly, the average value of LCCsh1 in the post-deregulation period, 26.3 per cent, was almost twice the share of LCCs in the pre-deregulation period, 14.1 per cent. The average value of LCCsh2, the independent LCCs flight shares, in the post-deregulation period recorded a 17 per cent, which was only 2.9 per cent higher than that of pre-deregulation. The difference between the average values for LCCsh1 and LCCsh2, about 9 per cent, represents the flight shares scheduled by the legacy carriers' subsidiary LCCs. These huge gaps between the two measures could be attributed to the two legacy carriers\u2019 intense multiproduct activity through their own subsidiary LCCs operation in the post-deregulation. The value less than one for RelFare would imply that the average airfare for the Jeju island routes was lower than that of the inland routes. A reduction in flight duration, combined with a rise in LCC flight shares, would support an evidence that deregulation has led to structural change in the Jeju island routes, removing restrictions imposed on aircraft size and eliminating the administrative regulation of entry into the Korean airline industries.",

Along with the fact that no independent LCCs operated any of the six inland routes in the deregulated period, LCCsh2 has a virtually zero value. With respect to RelFare, the value greater than one would imply that the average airfare for the inland routes was higher than that of the Jeju island routes. The inland routes recorded a relatively low load factor as compared to the Jeju island routes, the country's largest island and tourist destination. This low average value for LoadFac is not surprising because there are substitutable transportation modes such as bus, rail, and automobile.

Scheduling patterns of departure flight times constrained by both the demand side and supply side perspectives would affect the number of passengers on a route, thereby the load factor, LoadFac. Thus we control for these potentially endogenous variables using instrumental variables (IVs).

The estimates of two models of departure flight times differentiation are presented in Table 8\n; we attempt to fit a regression to pooled data from 6 inland non-stop routes.20\nThe estimated impacts of both LCOMP1 and LCOMP2 are negative, implying that competition leads to a less differentiated scheduling pattern with regard to departure times.

The results suggest that for the inland routes the degree of this tendency for less product differentiation is relatively weak when compared with the Jeju island routes in the post-deregulated period. In other words, the larger gaps among departure flight times were found in the deregulated period than in the regulated period. The reason why deregulation is estimated to have route type-specific effects can be due to the fact that the Jeju island routes (leisure type routes) recorded high volumes of passenger traffic relative to the inland routes (business type routes). The Korean airline industry deregulation has led to substantial traffic growth, carrying more passengers at lower fares. In particular, competition among the two legacy carriers and independent LCCs for the Jeju island routes has intensified due to the dominance of air transportation for travel to and from Jeju island, the country's largest island and tourist's destination. Along with the demand-driven motivation, fuel costs and capacity constraints also provide an incentive for a carrier to schedule more frequent flights, which are concentrated into the route of high demand, in a more strongly clustered pattern as opposed to less frequent flights for the low demand routes, resulting an asymmetric pattern of clustered departure flight times across the type of routes in the deregulated period. We see that its interaction effect with competition level is negative and statistically significant.

The changed competition conditions, which culminated with the implementation of the May 2008 Deregulation Act, contributed to route-type specific consequences: the Jeju island routes (leisure type) and the inland routes (business type). We find a strongly clustered pattern of airline scheduling in the Jeju island routes where there have been competitive pressures associated with new low cost entrants. On the other hand, due to the lack of entry to inland routes, we find partial support for the clustered pattern of airline scheduling. The two legacy carriers' subsidiary LCCs operation leads to less dominant pattern of clustered flight, lowering the competition level.
