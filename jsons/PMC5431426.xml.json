Several cases of family clusters have been reported since the outbreak of the novel H7N9 avian influenza virus in 2013 in China, with 8% of H7N9 infections occurring in clusters10, and most cases of the family clusters were found to share a common history of poultry exposure, resulting in difficulty in differentiating between common exposure and human-to-human transmission1, 11. Although healthcare workers with H7N9 infections have been reported in H7N9 clusters12, epidemiologic and virologic evidence demonstrates limited and non-sustainable human-to-human transmissibility of the H7N9 virus13, 14. On January 2015, two separate family clusters were identified in Fujian Province, Southeast China. In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, and virologic characteristics of four H7N9 cases from these two family clusters, and we investigated the possibility of human-to-human transmission in these clusters.",

The index patient (the son) was a 54-year-old man with a fever of 40 \u00b0C at the onset of illness on January 5, 2014, and he saw a countryside doctor. However, his fever did not improve after 4 days of treatment. On January 13, the son was admitted to Putian Municipal No. 1 Hospital (Putian, China) because he experienced more severe coughing and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown origin and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the H7N9 virus was detected in his throat-swab samples by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Oseltamivir was given as an antiviral treatment against H7N9 infection; however, the son, unfortunately, died on January 15. The second patient was the index patient\u2019s 77-year-old mother, who was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection through monitoring and testing of close contacts with the confirmed index patient. On January 5, she saw a countryside doctor because of coughing and dizziness, and her physical condition improved following a 2-day treatment. She was investigated because of her close contact with her son, and her throat-swab specimen was collected and analyzed on January 15. On the following day (January 16), she was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection, and she was transferred to the Affiliated Hospital of Putian University (Putian, China) and placed in an isolated ward. Her vital signs and a routine blood test were normal during her stay in the hospital; however, oseltamivir was administered and she was not discharged from the hospital until two consecutive PCR assays of her throat-swab specimens were negative on January 22. The index patient lived with his mother in a two-floor house in Putian city, Fujian Province, where live poultry were freely bred in the backyard, which was full of chicken feathers and feces. According to the recollections of the patient\u2019s family members, most of their neighbors bred live poultry, and some of the poultry died prior to his reported illness. Before the son became ill on January 5, his mother lived in extremely close contact with him, including feeding chickens, sitting, and eating together until January 13.",

At dusk, the grandfather visited a rural hospital and received an antondin injection and traditional Chinese medicine (no exact details are available). During the period from January 7 through 13, he had recurrent clinical manifestations, including weakness, coughing, shortness of breath, and fever, and his highest body temperature was 39.6 \u00b0C. Then, he visited Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University (Xiamen, China), and he was given cefotaxime treatment for 3 days. Because of the development of a more severe shortness of breath, the grandfather was hospitalized on January 15, and a routine blood test revealed a 2.75 \u00d7 109/L white blood cell (WBC) count, which comprised 81% neutrophils and 16% lymphocytes. Oseltamivir, cefotaxime, doxycycline, and other symptomatic treatments were given for anti-infective therapy. He was diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown origin by consultation with multi-disciplinary experts on the morning of January 16, and his throat-swab specimens were collected and transferred to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention to detect the H7N9 virus. On the afternoon of January 16, he was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection. Because his physical condition improved, he was discharged from the hospital on February 4. The second patient was the index patient\u2019s 2-year-old grandson, who was admitted to Zhongshan Hospital because of facial paralysis. Because of his close contact with his grandfather, the grandson was investigated, and his throat-swab specimens were sampled on January 16. He was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection by RT-PCR on January 17, and he had a fever of 39 \u00b0C in the afternoon. Then, he was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University (Xiamen, China) and placed in an isolated ward. A routine blood test revealed a 1.04 \u00d7 1010/L WBC count, comprising 71% neutrophils and 13% lymphocytes. After the virus failed to be detected in the throat-swab specimen, the grandson was discharged from the hospital on January 23. The grandfather frequently visited a live poultry market near his house prior to the onset of his illness. After the grandfather became ill on January 6, he had close contact with his grandson (from January 10 to 14), including sitting and eating together, as well as kissing and hugging. The grandson did not visit any live poultry market, and he did not have any direct contact with live poultry.",

To investigate the phylogenetic and genetic characteristics of the H7N9 viruses from these two family clusters, their complete genome sequences were analyzed and compared with several representative genome sequences available in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database (www.gisaid.org). Based on the temporal distribution of the H7N9 viral strains, 41 complete genome sequences of H7N9 viruses from the four epidemic waves were selected for phylogenetic analysis, and eight gene segments were closely related to each other, with \u226593.4% homology (Table 2). The viral strains isolated from the patients in the same family cluster shared high sequence similarities (Table 2), and all eight gene segments clustered together in the phylogenetic trees, with \u226599.9% (cluster 1) and \u226599.8% (cluster 2) identities in all eight gene segments at the nucleotide level. High sequence similarities were also observed between the complete genome sequences of the A/British Columbia/1/2015 viral strain from Canadian patients and the A/Fujian/18/2015 (the first patient from cluster 2) and A/Fujian/22/2015 viral strains from Xiamen, Fujian Province, China (Fig. 2), suggesting that two Canadian travel-associated cases became infected with the H7N9 virus in Xiamen. Table 2 and Fig. 2 show that the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments had fewer nucleotide substitutions during viral genetic evolution relative to the other six internal gene segments (those encoding polymerase basic protein 2 [PB2], polymerase basic protein 1 [PB1], polymerase acidic protein [PA], nucleoprotein [NP], matrix-2 protein [M2], and non-structural protein 1 [NS1]).\n\n",

For the HA protein, all four H7N9 viruses contained G186V and Q226L substitutions (H3 numbering), which have been shown to increase the binding affinity of the H7N9 virus in the human upper respiratory tract16, 17, and the A/Fujian/18/2015 viral isolate contained an additional G225D substitution in the receptor binding site.

To date, the virus has caused four outbreaks in humans, and most cases occurred during winter and spring25. The H7N9 virus is a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus, and it does not cause identifiable illness or death in poultry, whereas humans act as sentinels for the presence of these viruses in avian infections17. Currently, humans get infected with the H7N9 virus predominantly through contact with asymptomatic poultry, and sporadically via direct contact or exposure to environments that are contaminated with infected poultry1. However, there are increasing reports of clusters of human cases infected with the H7N9 virus, among which some cases have close contacts and some share common exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets, thereby resulting in difficulty in identifying viral transmission routes (either via common exposure or human-to-human transmission)26, 27. However, close, persistent, and unprotected contacts with symptomatic cases with H7N9 virus infections may cause human-to-human transmission, although this transmissibility is limited and non-sustainable13, 14. Therefore, it is important to examine the likelihood of efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus. Here, we reported the epidemiological, clinical, and virologic characteristics of two family clusters with H7N9 virus infections in Southeast China to clarify the transmission and pathogenicity of the virus.",

We collected specimens from live-poultry markets neighboring the patients\u2019 houses, and H7N9 viruses were detected in the poultry washing water and cage surface cleaning wipes by RT-PCR (Supplementary Table S1); however, it was unfortunate that the H7 and N9 gene sequences were not obtained at that time. It was estimated previously that the mean incubation period of the H7N9 virus is 3.3 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.7 days), with a 0.76 coefficient of variation (95% CI, 0.1 to 5.5)28, 29. The onset of H7N9 infection-like syndromes occurred on the same day in the two patients from cluster 1 (January 5, 2015), and the time required for human-to-human transmission was not met, implying a simultaneous or common route of infection. For cluster 2, the index patient visited a live poultry market frequently prior to the onset of his illness (January 6, 2015), with close contact with the secondary patient from January 10 to 14. The secondary patient became ill on January 17 without exposure to any live poultry market or direct contact with any poultry.

The four viral isolates from the two family clusters showed the features of the avian influenza A (H7N9) virus as reported previously40, in terms of their transmissibility, pathogenicity, host adaptation, and antiviral drug resistance. In addition, our data indicated that the A/Fujian/18/2015 virus contained an additional HA G225D substitution (the receptor binding site), which binds preferentially to \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids and may increase the likelihood of viral upper respiratory tract transmission41, 42. It was reported that the HA G225D mutation in the H1N1 virus potentially contributes to the specificity of HA for the sialic acid receptor Sia(\u03b12-6) Gal, thereby enabling the replication and transmission of the virus within and among humans43. In addition, we found that all four isolates were resistant to amantadine and rimantadine because of the S31N substitution in the M2 protein44. However, no substitutions were detected in the enzyme-active functional domains of the NA protein, suggesting that it is sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Thus, early clinical suspicions or confirmed cases of H7N9 virus infection and early administration of oseltamivir may help to reduce the severity of the disease. Since 2013, the HA and NA proteins of the H7N9 virus have maintained stable potential glycosylation sites, indicating that glycosylation may not be the factor affecting viral evolution and virulence.",

Until now, there has been no stable and effective human-to-human transmission of H7N9 viruses; however, increasing evidence shows that the H7N9 virus has become better adapted to mammalian infections3, 45, 46. Therefore, it is of great importance to strengthen the surveillance of the H7N9 virus among poultry and humans, confirm the source of infections, trace and investigate close contacts with confirmed cases, complete viral isolation from H7N9 patients quickly, and emphasize individual protective interventions. In addition, virologic analyses to assess genetic changes of the H7N9 virus are of great value to determine the viral transmissibility among humans, as well as the pandemic potential.",
