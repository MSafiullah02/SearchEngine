            "text": "M ODERN lung ventilators are equipped with a variety of support techniques that provide the clinician various ways of artificially ventilating patients. Mandatory minute ventilation (MMV) is one such ventilation technique that interact with the patient in such a way that the delivery of a preset minimum minute volume (inhaled volume per minute) is guaranteed. The number of volume control breaths 1 per minute automatically increases or decreases to ensure the delivery of the requested mandatory or minimum minute volume. The concept of MMV appears attractive in that it provides the ability to increase or decrease the number of volume control breaths in a given time span. Thus, if the patient is apneic, an appropriate number of volume control breaths are delivered, and as the patient resumes spontaneous ventilation, the number of volume control breaths decreases gradually. This support scheme provides flexibility for a patient to automatically take up the work load of breathing and for the machine to gradually wind down at the same time.",

In the event of an increase or decrease in arterial CO tension, the MMV setting may be decreased or increased respectively by the clinician to correct the disturbed arterial CO tension. Regulating the MMV setting to maintain an acceptable arterial CO tension could be performed automatically. This paper deals with such an automatic ventilation scheme that maintains the arterial CO tension less than a specified level determined by a clinician. 1 A volume control breath delivers a fixed volume specified by an operator.

            "text": "During respiration not all inhaled air reaches the alveoli, as part of it remains in the conducting portion of the airway. The region of the respiratory system where gas exchange does not take place is termed the respiratory dead space. By examining the CO content of the exhaled air, Bohr formulated the following relationship [1] : (1) where is the dead space, is the tidal volume (i.e., volume inhaled per breath), is the arterial CO tension, and is the average CO tension in exhaled air. A typical trace of exhaled CO tension against exhaled volume (i.e., SBT-CO plot 2 ) consists of three phases [1] : phase 1 comprising the CO -free gas from the airways, phase 2 a transition phase characterized by a S-shaped up-swing in the tracing representing the washout of airway with alveolar gas, and phase 3 comprising CO -bearing gas from the alveoli (see Fig. 1 ). The initial volume of expirate which includes the volume of fresh air down to the alveolar/fresh air interface represents the airway dead space. Airway dead space is, therefore, defined as the volume of air that does not reach the sites of gas exchange (i.e., alveolus). On the SBT-CO plot this corresponds to an exhaled volume in phase 2. The exact location of this position on the SBT-CO plot is reported in [2] and [3] , and here it is taken as the exhaled volume corresponding to the point of inflection on the SBT-CO curve. Alveolar tidal volume is the part of inhaled volume that reach the alveoli (2) where is alveolar tidal volume and is airway dead space. However, not all inhaled air that reaches the gas exchanging zone takes part in the mixing process. This fractional volume in alveoli that does not contribute to gas exchange is termed alveolar dead space. Combination of alveolar dead space and airway dead space defines the total dead space of the respiratory system (3) where is alveolar dead space. The effective alveolar ventilation is the difference between alveolar tidal volume and alveolar dead space (4) where is the effective alveolar ventilation. The alveolar dead space can be related to areas of SBT-CO plot (see Fig. 2 ). In Fig. 2 , the dashed vertical line falls through the point of inflection of the SBT-CO curve. The areas and represents the following.",

The continuous estimation of arterial CO tension is based on instantaneous, correlated measurements of ventilatory flow, airway pressure, and CO tension of exhaled air measured by a capnograph. Although end tidal CO tension may approximately follow the variations in arterial CO tension, various studies have shown that utilization of end tidal CO as a noninvasive monitoring substitute for trends in arterial CO tension in critically ill patients may be misleading [6] , [7] . The algorithms described here are based on the efficiency of gas mixing in the lung as oppose to an algorithm based on end tidal CO tension. The efficiency of gas exchange may be defined using Bohr's equation efficiency (6) where is the dead space, is the tidal volume, is the arterial CO tension, and is the average CO tension of exhaled air. The term represents how well the inhaled tidal volume is used in the lungs for the purpose of gas exchange, and hence the term may be referred to as the efficiency of gas mixing efficiency (7) Experiments carried out on human subjects [5] , [8] have found that the efficiency of gas mixing stays relatively constant for various levels of ventilation. Hence, if the efficiency of gas mixing is calculated upon performing a blood test and assumed constant in an individual patient for subsequent breaths following the blood test, the only unknown in (7) is the blood CO tension, provided that the average partial pressure of CO in exhaled air is known. Using basic gas laws, can be expressed as follows: (8) where",
