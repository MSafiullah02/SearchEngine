Intravascular fibrin generation has been described during the last decade as an effector of innate immunity: activation of coagulation generates thrombin which drives many amplifications pathways. This concept is resumed as thrombo-inflammation [5] . The inflammatory response observed in patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy can activate coagulation using several pathways (polyphosphates, complement pathway, granulocyte NETosis expelling cell-free DNA and histones) but the cytokines and chemokines generated by the challenged immune system can also activate monocytes and vascular endothelial cells leading to a prothrombotic phenotype. We have no evidence that the SARS-Cov-2 virus can directly activate coagulation. However, significant inflammation is present in patients with the viral infection, based on elevated levels of IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen at presentation, and elevated plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines were found, with higher levels in ICU-patients. Some patients do have a \"cytokine storm\", which may explain more dramatic changes in coagulation tests.",

There is however no data to support full dose anticoagulation at this time for this indication and in prior trials of anticoagulation with sepsis, lowdose heparin was used.

Are we sure that elevated D-dimers in COVID-19 uniformly mean an intravascular fibrin generation, meaning a clinical prognosis? Is worsening coagulopathy a consequence of poor outcomes, or at least a partial cause? Do we have any demonstration that anticoagulant-based treatments can have an inverse dose-effect relationship 4 between their intensity and the severity of the coagulopathy? Are anticoagulants really the best approach for limiting thrombotic complications of the thrombo-inflammation process, or do we have to test multi-drug approaches, including anticytokine treatments\u2026? COVID-19 coagulopathy marks the end of too simple thrombotic risk models and leads us into a complex domain fuelled by polymorphic, sometimes systemic alterations affecting multiple interconnected biological systems, which we do not yet know how to qualify, explore and quantify.

Obese patients have a doubling of their daily injection. Individual patient assessment incorporating an evaluation of the bleeding risk is required. Of note, COVID-19 coagulopathy do not result in significant bleeding. The treatment of microvascular thrombosis, which may also be responsible for multiorgan failure, is problematic due to the absence of treatment against the virus. Heparin and derivatives have demonstrated limited efficacy in sepsis-induced coagulopathy. Antithrombin and soluble thrombomodulin may have a trend towards increased survival in septic patients with laboratory proven DIC. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy should be managed like other coagulopathy, including sepsis-associated DIC.",
