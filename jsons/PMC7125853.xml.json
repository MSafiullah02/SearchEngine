            "text": "The spike glycoprotein, found on the virion envelope of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is a major determinant of viral pathogenicity (Phillips et al., 1999). Entry into susceptible cells and cell-to-cell spread of MHV are mediated by the spike. Spike is synthesized as an 180- to 220-kDa glycosylated precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved into two 90-kDa subunits, S1 and S2 (Frana et al., 1985). Oligomeric spike is present on both viral and infected cell membranes. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike has been mapped to the amino-terminal 330 amino acid residues of the S1 subunit (Kubo et al., 1994), which is though to form the globular head of the spike. The RBD is responsible for the initial attachment of MHV to the cell-surface receptors, members of the CEACAM subclass of the CEA gene family (Dveksler et al., 1991). This initial binding event is thought to trigger a conformational change in spike that allows S2, the stalk portion of the peplomer, to initiate fusion of the two membranes Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001, Matsuyama and Taguchi 2002a, Zelus et al 2003. A candidate fusion peptide domain has been identified within S2 (Luo and Weiss, 1998; Fig. 1); however, the actual fusion peptide for the MHV spike has not been definitively identified. Within S2 there are two heptad repeat (HR) domains (HR1 and HR2) which are structural features common to all coronavirus spikes as well as of attachment/fusion proteins of many other viruses (DeGroot et al., 1987). More recently, a third heptad repeat region located to the N-terminal side of HR1 was predicted within the MHV spike Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001, Krueger et al 2001. The HR domains are believed to form \u03b1-helical configurations, which have been though to play a role in the oligomerization of the spike peplomer DeGroot et al 1987, Luo et al 1999. It has also been believed that these domains participate in the conformational change of the spike peplomer, which allows for the insertion of the putative fusion peptide into the cell membrane and that interactions between HR1 and RBD may play a role in fusion Krueger et al 2001, Matsuyama and Taguchi 2002b. However, recently, it has been shown that the S1 subunit contains sequences responsible for oligomerization (Lewicki and Gallagher, 2003), suggesting that the conformational changes that spike undergoes during the process of fusion may be quite different from previously postulated.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the wild-type JHM strain (previously referred to as MHV-4; see Materials and methods) can utilize both endosomal and nonendosomal pathways for entry (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997). Wild-type JHM fuses at neutral pH; however, persistent JHM infection of a neuronal cell line (OBL21a) gave rise to an acid-dependent fusion variant OBLV60. OBLV60 is unable to induce fusion at neutral pH and enters cells via the endosomal route Gallagher et al 1991, Nash and Buchmeier 1997. Sequencing of the spike genes of JHM and OBLV60 demonstrated that there were eight amino acid differences between these two spike proteins. Five of these substitutions were located in the S1 subunit of the spike gene. However, it was demonstrated that the change from neutral pH-induced fusion to low pH-induced fusion was dependent on the amino acid substitutions Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R, all within the first heptad repeat (HR1) of the S2 subunit (Gallagher et al., 1991; see Fig. 1).",

In contrast, the OBLV60 variant is neuroattenuated; infection with OBLV60 is limited mainly to the neurons of the mitral and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulbs, and no fatal encephalitis is observed (Pearce et al., 1994). We wanted to determine whether the three amino acid substitutions in the HR1 of the OBLV60 spike were responsible for its low pH-dependent route of entry into cells in vitro and/or the attenuation and limited spread of the virus in vivo. It was also important to determine whether these phenotypes could be dissociated from each other. We were particularly interested in the substitution at residue L1114, as this residue has been substituted in viruses with altered phenotypes isolated in several studies Gallagher et al 1991, Wang et al 1992, Saeki et al 1997.",

Subsequently we used recombinant viruses expressing chimeric spike proteins to demonstrate that the RBD determines the specificity of receptor utilization (Tsai et al., 2003). Here we focus on the phenotype of a virus encoding the three HR1 amino acids that were previously shown to be sufficient to result in the low pH-dependent requirement for cell-to-cell fusion (Gallagher et al., 1991). Thus, we have selected recombinant viruses with a defined genetic background expressing the JHM spike protein, encoding the amino acid substitutions in HR1 of OBLV60 (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R) or L1114 alone. The three substitutions are sufficient to confer a neuroattenuated phenotype to this recombinant virus, which similar to OBLV60, displays virus spread restricted to the olfactory bulbs. Interestingly the L1114R substitution alone is capable of causing in vivo attenuation and restricted spread, while displaying a fusion phenotype close to wild-type as well as the ability to enter cells at neutral pH.",

If so, we then wanted to determine whether these in vivo phenotypes were dependent on the in vitro property of acid pH-dependent fusion and entry Gallagher et al 1991, Nash and Buchmeier 1997. This was not possible to accomplish with OBLV60, due to the presence of five other substitutions within S1 (Fig. 1) and an unknown number of amino acid substitutions outside of the spike. Thus, we used targeted RNA recombination to select isogenic recombinant viruses expressing the JHM spike gene encoding either the three HR1 amino acid substitutions (SJHM-HR1) or the L1114R alone (SJHM-L1114R), as well as a virus expressing wild-type JHM spike (SJHM-RA59) Kuo et al 2000, Phillips et al 2001. (See Fig. 1 for a schematic of the spike proteins expressed by these viruses.) All these viruses had genes other than spike derived from MHV-A59 (Phillips et al., 1999) and are described under Materials and methods.",

This is consistent with previous data on the inability of OBLV60 to induce cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH (Gallagher et al., 1991) and confirms the observation that the three amino acid substitutions in HR1 (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R) present in both SJHM-HR1 and OBLV60 are sufficient to confer a fusion-negative phenotype at neutral pH. SJHM-L1114R, expressing the L1114R substitution alone, does induce significant levels of cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH; however, fusion induced by this recombinant is less extensive than that induced by SJHM-RA59 (Fig. 3).

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is known to enter cells via the endosomal pathway and to require low pH for entry, was used as a control. In the presence of 20 mM ammonium chloride, the replication of VSV was reduced about 10,000-fold at 12 and 24 h postinfection of L2 cells (Fig. 4). Similarly, the replication of SJHM-HR1 was reduced more than 1000-fold in the presence of 20 mM ammonium chloride. Similar levels of inhibition were observed for OBLV60 (Gallagher et al., 1991; our data, not shown). In contrast, only a minimal reduction in replication level was observed when either SJHM-RA59 or SJHM-L1114R infection of L2 cells was carried in the presence of ammonium chloride. (Statistical analysis demonstrated, however, that SJHM-L1114R was inhibited to a greater extent than SJHM-RA59.) Similar patterns of inhibition were observed in infections carried out in the presence of 40 \u03bcM chloroquine (data not shown). Thus, the L1114R substitution alone does not result in an absolute dependence on low pH for virus entry.",

OBLV60 is a highly neuroattenuated mutant of JHM (Pearce et al., 1994). To determine whether the three amino acid substitutions in the HR1 of OBLV60 or L1114R alone are sufficient to confer a neuroattenuated phenotype, mice were inoculated either intracranially (ic) or intranasally (in) with serial dilutions of SJHM-RA59, SJHM-HR1, and SJHM-L1114R and observed for disease and death. Inoculation with SJHM-HR1 (up to 5000 PFU ic and up to 105 PFU in) or with SJHM-L1114R (up to 104 PFU ic) did not result in any mortality throughout the 21 to 28 days the mice were observed. In contrast, mice inoculated with doses as low as 1 PFU ic or 1000 PFU in of SJHM-RA59 exhibited clinical signs of disease, such as hunched posture, ruffled fur, and abnormal gait with occasional paralysis, at 4\u20135 days postinfection.

We used the in route of inoculation because it is a more natural route and detection of viral antigen following in inoculation is more discreet than following ic inoculation. Thus, mice were inoculated in with 5000 PFU each of SJHM-RA59, SJHM-HR1, or SJHM-L1114R and titers of infectious virus in the brain at various times postinfection were determined by plaque titration. Patterns of infection with all of these viruses were similar in terms of kinetics and extent of replication; viral replication in the brain peaked at 5 days postinfection (Fig. 5). SJHM-HR1 displayed slightly higher viral titers at 5 and 7 days postinfection as compared to SJHM-RA59; however, the difference was less than 1.0 log10 unit. SJHM-L1114R replicated less efficiently than SJHM-RA59; however, the difference between the titer of infectious virus in the brains of mice infected with these two viruses at 5 days postinfection was not significant (two-tailed t test, P < 0.06 and P < 0.11 for each of the two SJHM-L1114R isolates).

These sections were labeled with polyclonal antisera directed against MHV structural proteins and then detected using a biotin-avidin-labeled secondary antibody as described under Materials and methods. The difference in the patterns of viral antigen distribution observed in the brains of animals infected with SJHM-RA59 and the viruses expressing mutant spike was striking. The distribution of SJHM-RA59 viral antigen was widespread. Viral antigen was detected in olfactory bulbs, as well as in other regions of the brain, from the basal forebrain to the brain stem (Phillips et al., 1999). (Fig. 6\nshows sections from the basal forebrain and the olfactory bulbs.) However, in mice infected with SJHM-HR1 or SJHM-L1114R, viral antigen was primarily detected in the mitral layer of the olfactory bulbs and in the adjacent glomerular and external plexiform layers (see below). Outside the olfactory bulbs, there were only occasional antigen-positive cells. The majority of antigen-positive cells looked morphologically similar to neurons. Thus, both mutants showed patterns of antigen distribution similar to OBLV60 (Pearce et al., 1994); this indicates that the L1114R substitution alone, as well as the three HR1 substitutions, is sufficient to restrict antigen expression to the olfactory bulbs.",

In mice infected with either the single or the triple substitution HR mutants, the level of infectious virus within the olfactory bulbs was 2\u20135 log10 units greater than that in the rest of the brain. (The distribution of infectious virus was similar in brains from mice infected with OBLV60 (Fig. 8; Pearce et al., 1994).) For recombinant virus expressing wild-type JHM spike, approximately equal amounts of infectious virus were detected in the olfactory bulbs and the rest of the brain. Thus, for each virus, the amount of infectious virus present in the olfactory bulb as compared with the rest of the brain is consistent with level of viral antigen detected in each fraction (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8). For all viruses examined, the olfactory bulbs are an abundant source of infectious virus. The olfactory bulbs represent approximately 6% of the weight of the brain, yet even in animals infected with recombinant expressing wild-type spike, olfactory bulbs contain close to half the infectious virus.",

Thus, we used targeted recombination to select viruses in a defined genetic background, differing from the parental virus only in the three mutations in HR1 of S2. These viruses express the JHM spike protein containing the three HR1 substitutions present in the OBLV60 spike (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R). The genes other than the spike in these viruses were derived from MHV-A59. We had shown previously that the parental virus used for comparison for these experiments, SJHM- RA59, which contains the wild-type JHM spike, displays in vitro properties and the high neurovirulence phenotype exhibited by wild-type JHM (Phillips et al., 1999). We found that the recombinant virus, expressing the JHM spike with HR1 mutations. SJHM-HR1, displays similar phenotypes to OBLV60 (Gallagher et al., 1991; J.C. Tsai and S.R. Weiss, unpublished data). As described above, this includes sensitivity to lysosomotropic agents, inability to induce cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH, as well as in vivo attenuation. Thus, with respect to the HR1 substitutions within JHM spike, the background genes of the virus (MHV-A59 or JHM) do not influence the phenotypes that we have studied here.",

Our observations that SJHM-HR1 is highly attenuated in neurovirulence and restricted in spread from the olfactory bulbs into the more caudal areas of the brain allow us to conclude that the HR1 substitutions are responsible for the altered pathogenesis displayed by OBLV60 (Pearce et al., 1994).",

SJHM-L1114R induced syncytia at neutral pH, albeit at a lower level than SJHM- RA59; furthermore SJHM-L1114R was relatively resistant to the effects of lysosomotropic agents, but not quite as resistant as parental SJHM-RA59. Yet, the SJHM-L1114R viruses were attenuated and displayed antigen only in the olfactory bulbs.

By analogy with other viral spike proteins, such as HIV gp41 and influenza HA2, it is believed that conformational changes in spike, mediated by intramolecular heptad repeat interactions, are necessary to promote fusion through the insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide in the opposing cell\u2019s membrane White 1992, Carr et al 1997, Singh et al 1999. The three substitutions present in the SJHM-HR1 spike are found within HR1, downstream of the putative fusion peptide (Luo and Weiss, 1998). We have observed previously that uncharged-to-charged amino acid changes within HR1, such as L to R, can affect the ability of the MHV spike to induce cell-to-cell fusion despite the fact that such spike molecules are processed and delivered to the plasma membrane (Luo and Weiss, 1998). Gallagher et al. (1991) suggested that the acquisition of a titratable proton and/or positive charge, as a result of the Q-to-H substitutions within the OBLV60 spike HR1, could result in the requirement for a low pH (pH 6) environment for the activation of fusion. However for the OBLV60 spike and the spike proteins studied here, multiple substitutions were necessary for the low pH requirement for fusion; in a vaccinia virus based expression system, neither spike proteins with the L1114R alone nor proteins with both Q-to-H substitutions without L1114R could induce the altered fusion phenotype (Gallagher et al., 1991). Consistent with this, the L1114R substitution alone results in only a small decrease in the ability to induce cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH and does not confer significant sensitivity to ammonium chloride (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).",

In addition to L1114R in the OBLV60 spike (Gallagher et al., 1991), substitutions at this residue have been identified in the spike of a monoclonal antibody resistant mutant (Wang et al., 1992) and a soluble receptor resistant mutant, srr7 (Saeki et al., 1997). The srr7 mutant (expressing a spike containing L1114F) demonstrated increased stability of the S1/S2 interaction, the loss of the ability to induce CEACAM-independent fusion (Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002), and altered interactions with CEACAM1b as well as soluble receptor Matsuyama and Taguchi 2002a, Matsuyama and Taguchi 2002b. Similarly, OBLV60 exhibits increased thermostability (M. Buchmeier, personal communication) and loss of the ability to induce CEACAM-independent fusion (T. Gallagher, personal communication). The recombinant virus expressing L1114R alone (described in this article) is also unable to induce CEACAM-independent cell-to-cell fusion (data not shown). Finally, recombinant viruses expressing A59/JHM chimeric spikes were also neuroattenuated, thermostable, and unable to induce receptor independent cell-to-cell fusion Tsai and Weiss 2001, Tsai et al 2003. Thus, these data are consistent with the observation that high thermolability, the ability to induce receptor-independent fusion, and the propensity to dissociate from receptor are associated with high neurovirulence and rapid spread in the CNS and relatively less efficient replication in cultured cells, displayed by JHM Krueger et al 2001, Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001, Phillips et al 1999.",

By day 5, both SJHM-RA59 and mutant viruses (SJHM-HR1 and SJHM-L1114R) replicated to much higher titers, per gram of tissue in the olfactory bulb, as compared with the rest of the brain (Fig. 8). Thus, the titer of infectious virus in the olfactory bulbs represents a large fraction of total virus in the brain and the ability of virus to replicate in the olfactory bulb is sufficient to achieve a high titer. Furthermore, the observation that the recombinant viruses expressing mutant spikes replicated to similar titers as wild-type is consistent with previous observations that the level of replication of MHV in the CNS is not necessarily reflective of the neurovirulence level (Phillips et al., 1999).",

Alternatively, it is possible that the neurons of the olfactory bulbs are different from other neurons (perhaps, for example, in receptor expression) and that viruses with the L1114R substitution cannot replicate in cells outside the olfactory bulbs. However, this is not an absolute restriction, because at later times postinfection, increased numbers of infected cells are detected outside of olfactory bulbs (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, OBLV60 can spread beyond the olfactory bulbs when the immune response is compromised (Pearce et al., 1994). Thus, it is likely that the differences in the efficiency of replication between the mutant and the wild-type recombinant viruses in the CNS give the immune response an advantage that restricts spread sooner and more efficiently than for wild-type virus.",
