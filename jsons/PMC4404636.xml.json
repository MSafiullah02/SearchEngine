In a context of renewed and intensified commitment of the international community towards malaria eradication [4,9,10], a surge of interest has emerged regarding this species, possibly because of the major challenges posed for its control, ensuing from its poorly understood ability to present clinical relapses [5,10], but also due to its capacity to cause a more complicated disease [11-13]. P. vivax benign clinical course has now been completely reconsidered, as the evidence of life-threatening disease has been reported from diverse endemic areas, such as Latin America [7,14,15], India [16,17], and Southeast Asia and the Pacific regions [18,19]. In spite of the World Health Organization (WHO) recognition as early as 2006 of the potential of P. vivax to cause severe disease [20], there are still several gaps in knowledge to be filled [5,11,21,22].",

Indeed not all endemic areas have been reporting severity attributed to infection with this parasite, such as the Thailand-Myanmar border, where severity was reported only very recently [23]. In the absence of adequate experimental models, or the paucity of postmortem samples to further elucidate the pathophysiology of this infection [5,13,24], systematic multisite clinical studies become a unique opportunity to better understand this geographic variability and characterize the severe vivax malaria syndrome. Indeed, comprehensive reviews of the literature demonstrate that severe vivax malaria occurrence is an old, and not infrequent, phenomenon that was not being properly recognized [12,25,26].",

Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) is located in the city of Manaus, in the Brazilian Western Amazon, with 150 beds for hospitalization. This hospital is the reference tropical medicine and infectious disease center for the area, and receives patients from all over the Amazonas state, referred or not to this service. Admission is free of charge, and admission criteria for malaria patients are any clinical complications suggestive of severe malaria, or complications impacting proper antimalarial treatment, such as severe vomiting. Six other hospitals in town are the reference for pediatric diseases. Anopheles darlingi is the major malaria vector in the region, with transmission occurring continuously throughout the year with peaks in the beginning of the dry and the wet season. In recent years there has been a decrease in the number of reported episodes paralleled to an increase in the proportion of cases attributed to P. vivax, which is now responsible for more than 90% of cases of malaria in the region [27]. Sardar Patel Medical College (SPMC) hospital is located in Bikaner in the Rajasthan state of India, where, as a result of environmental and climatic reasons, malaria transmission has a well-defined seasonal pattern with practically no cases being reported during the dry season, and P. vivax is responsible for 50% of the cases [28]. An. stephensi, An. culifascies, and An. annularis are the major malaria vectors in the region (Figure 1). The hospital includes around 500 beds for hospitalization in general, and a specific malaria ward, which remains closed except for the duration of the malaria season. The hospital receives referrals from the entire Rajasthan state, although other hospitals (including private ones) are also available for patients in the area. Admission is free with the exception of certain subsidized procedures, and during the malaria season most of the patients are routinely admitted to this ward, often because they are being referred. Neither of the two hospitals is a specifically pediatric referral center, although pediatric patients may be admitted in both.",

In addition to the reading performed for patients\u2019 diagnosis, each blood slide was analyzed independently by two microscopists. A slide was recorded as negative if no parasite was detected in the 200-field reading. If parasites were detected on the slide, quantification was performed by counting the number of asexual and sexual parasites until either 500 leukocytes or 500 parasites were counted (whichever occurred first). In case of discordance (species-specific, or in the density quantification whenever discrepancy was higher than 10%), a third reading was performed by a different microscopist. The parasite density was calculated by the arithmetic mean of two concordant readings and the white blood cell count obtained from the total blood count analysis as previously described [32]. In addition, species-specific real-time PCR for Plasmodium was performed to confirm P. vivax mono-infection status and exclude P. falciparum co-infection. P. malariae was not tested considering previous data from both sites confirming the absence of circulation of this species in the study areas.

There was evidence of association of female gender as a risk factor for death among P. vivax admitted patients, and although the proportions of individuals with chronic co-morbidities and non-pregnant women were higher among the patients who died, the differences were not meaningful and the lack of power needs to be taken into consideration (Table 4). Similar findings resulted when the same analysis was performed per site (data not shown). Further characterization of specific manifestations is shown below. An additional linear regression analysis on the association with the number of severe criteria in each patient with the same investigated risk factors was also undertaken, with the only variables with significant association being female gender (coefficient = 0.45; P = 0.001), pregnancy status (coefficient = 0.81; P = 0.002), and the presence of any chronic co-morbidity (coefficient = 0.45; P = 0.049).",

Through additional investigations, we have been able to identify a high number of associated co-morbidities, although by not performing a systematic investigation in all admitted cases from both sites, there was an important limitation on estimating the prevalence of their occurrence and association with severe syndromes, an important issue to consider [35,36]. Furthermore, although we have tried to ascertain the presence of previous chronic co-morbidities through medical interviews and patient record revisions, the possibility of underreporting and underdiagnosis must be considered. Indeed, one of the main concerns of the protocol was to exclude misdiagnosis and co-infection with P. falciparum by applying validated and standardized molecular methods [33], as microscopy can frequently miss out or even misdiagnose a varied proportion of cases. Our data provide yet again a robust confirmation of the potential of this species to cause significant morbidity and even mortality, a fact now widely recognized by the scientific community and by WHO in its recently published severe malaria monograph [37]. Indeed, the associated case fatality rate (CFR) among admitted patients to the study in the Brazilian Amazon (0.9%) and Indian Rajasthan (1.5%) is not negligible, and is comparable to CFRs previously described in Papua New Guinea [38] and Indonesia [18], and not too dissimilar to those for P. falciparum in Africa [2]. These findings must be taken cautiously, as the low incidence of P. falciparum in the study areas and the hospital-based design can limit comparisons and estimates of community CFRs. However, when compared the overall hospitalization and fatality rates, a striking difference could be observed between Manaus and Bikaner, as the latter presented much higher rates, up to 20-fold higher for fatality.",

The influence of these factors could already be observed by comparing the descriptions of clinical epidemiology of complications associated with this infection from different sites, showing that in areas of higher transmission intensities, children are the most frequently affected population [18,19,39,40], while in areas of moderate and low intensities, adults contribute more to the proportion of severe cases [7,14,41]. Our study highlighted many of these differences. For instance, when comparing patients hospitalized at both sites, there was evidence that the higher proportion of patients being admitted in India was secondary to a higher frequency of first malarial infections in that location, reflecting distinctive transmission dynamics, including a differential pattern of relapse rates that could contribute to some degree of clinical immunity among Brazilian patients [42,43]. The spectrum of clinical complications in both sites was broadly similar, with severe anemia being by far the most frequent of the complications, as previously described in other P. vivax endemic settings [14,17,18,44], and followed by acute renal failure, a complication that seems to be particularly frequent in the two countries where the study was conducted albeit rare elsewhere [37]. The presence of three or more severity criteria was also frequent and common at both sites. The proportion of severe malaria cases with acute lung injury/respiratory distress was, however, significantly higher among Brazilian patients. This particular difference could be due to a number of factors, including a higher proportion of Indian patients being systematically treated with antibiotics, or differences in parasite virulence or host genetics, which could not be assessed in this study and should be considered in future studies. However, our data point to the beginning of antimalarial treatment as a triggering phenomenon of respiratory distress, which needs further investigation. There were only six episodes of cerebral malaria among our patients, with one of them presenting co-infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) isolated by PCR from the CSF, in agreement with data from other settings showing low rates of occurrence [45].",

One of the most striking findings in this study was the confirmation that pregnancy seems to be a clear risk factor for severe vivax malaria and even for death (despite being only borderline significant). It has been argued that, unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax rarely causes severe malaria in pregnant women [37,46-48]; however, our series confirms a very high and almost identical proportion (above 2/3 in both sites) of pregnancies among the cases of severe malaria occurring in women of reproductive age, and four maternal deaths (all occurring in Bikaner). Pregnant women were systematically evaluated for obstetric complications, allowing us to diagnose an abortion occurring as a consequence of a subchorionic hematoma which we attributed to a malaria-related complication, leading us to hypothesize that further studies aimed at this population could properly detect and estimate the pregnancy-related burden of P. vivax infection. We were also able to detect the frequent occurrence of pregnancy-related complications such as subchorionic hematoma. On the other hand, the histopathological evidence in the literature points to minor damage of P. vivax-infected placentas [49,50]. Ongoing studies specifically targeting malaria in pregnancy in malaria endemic areas should help clarify the specific contribution of this parasite in causing maternal morbidity and death.",

Bacterial systemic concurrent infections were rarely observed in Manaus, which could be a potential reflection that among adult patients the concomitant occurrence of bacterial infection seems much rarer than that among P. falciparum-infected children [56]. Yet other studies have reported similar rates affecting both age groups [57], in which factors associated with each setting could be playing a higher role, a topic we could not explore due to the systematic use of antibiotics in Bikaner. There were, however, important differences in the prevalence of co-morbidities in Manaus and Bikaner, with the former presenting considerably higher frequencies of both acute and chronic illnesses. The difference in the observed proportions of co-morbidities between malaria endemic areas is a reflection of the local epidemiology influenced by the demographic and socioeconomic structures, and also of the health systems\u2019 capacities to diagnose and detect concomitant illnesses. Previous studies from the Brazilian Amazon region had already described the joint occurrence of malaria simultaneously with other health conditions, either acting as a contributing factor for severe manifestation or eventually being an incidental finding in patients with other severe diseases leading to critical illness or even fatal outcomes [14,25,58]. In a scenario where many tropical regions are facing epidemiological transition, the occurrence of P. vivax infection in individuals with chronic diseases is likely to become an important problem in these areas [59-61], putting a great deal of stress on and requiring effective recognition and management by local health systems.",

Other clinical syndromes were also observed to occur with considerable frequency, noteworthy anemia requiring transfusion and acute renal failure, with cerebral malaria remaining a rare and intriguing manifestation within this infection [45]. The WHO severe malaria criteria were initially developed to identify individuals with P. falciparum infection at higher risk of death [63], and there have been discussions among experts on the need to define specific severity criteria to be applied for P. vivax infection. Our study demonstrates that the application of the WHO criteria can reliably identify the patients at higher risk of complications, who therefore require more urgent and intensive care, which further agrees with previous pediatric data from the same research group [15]. A comprehensive analysis of the array of complications observed among the patients in our study and in the published literature provides reassurance of these findings by demonstrating that the spectrum of clinical manifestations is broadly covered by these definitions [12,25], with unusual manifestations being rarely reported. However, it seems important to highlight that severity derived from the use of primaquine among G6PD-deficient individuals, or splenic rupture, two well-known complications mostly seen in vivax infections [58,64], are not included in the current WHO definitions and should be carefully considered by clinicians working in vivax endemic areas. Furthermore, one must consider that in primary and community healthcare units, the characterization of the fulfillment of all WHO criteria is not possible due to the unavailability of laboratory facilities. More easily applicable guidelines to identify severely ill patients regardless of etiology must be used by health professionals to assist with decisions on referral or more aggressive management.",

Among the clinical and laboratory markers, only total bilirubin presented a high discriminative performance to identify more than three criteria of severe disease, showing that although jaundice was justifiably excluded from the WHO severe malaria criteria, it still has an important prognostic value and should not be dismissed by health professionals in their initial assessment of P. vivax-infected patients.

We decided to focus on providing a more comprehensive description of the clinical manifestations and complications associated with P. vivax infection in detriment to comparing disease expression between sites due to lack of adequate power and heterogeneity of procedures, undermining what could have been an important output from this study. The unrepresentativeness of children at both sites probably reflects the fact that neither of the sites is a reference center for pediatric populations, albeit publications from both locations have previously described severe manifestation among P. vivax-infected children [15,16]. The fact that the decisions to admit patients were made at the attending physician\u2019s discretion may have resulted in added selection bias, which we tried to minimize by applying the WHO severe malaria criteria and determining the occurrence of more than three criteria (as a surrogate for more severe disease). Note also that there are important differences in the health system organization as well as particular disparities in the management of cases, such as for example the systematic use of antibiotics upon admission in India. Ensuring that both sites followed the common protocol proved also to be challenging, and in some cases probably hinders some of the comparisons in this study, especially regarding the presence of co-morbidities, such as malnutrition and other co-infections. Also, by not systematically measuring some immune molecules that have been associated with clinical complications of this infection, such as superoxide dismutase-1 [67], an opportunity was missed to properly evaluate the prognostic value of some promising biomarkers that could be of potential utility for future case management.",
