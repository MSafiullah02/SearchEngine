UV promotes the formation of pyrimidine dimers within the nucleic acids of irradiated cells (Mitchell & Nairn, 1989). The extent of inactivation is a function of characteristics specific to the organism and the UV dose, which is the product of the incident irradiance expressed as mW/cm2 and the time (in seconds) of exposure. This product is expressed as mW\u00b7s/cm2 and is equivalent to mJ/cm2. The dose requirements for 4\u2010log10 (99.99%) inactivation of microorganisms range from 3\u201310 mJ/cm2 for vegetative bacteria (Wilson et al, 1992; Chang et al, 1985) to 20\u201350 mJ/cm2 for a number of human enteric viruses (Wilson et al, 1992).",

UV technology has been applied to drinking water for control of bacteria and viruses in Europe (Sommer et al, 1998) and in wastewater in the United States since the 1950s. Until recently, however, it had not been accepted as an effective disinfectant for control of Cryptosporidium. Early research using in vitro methods (excystation and vital dye stains) to assess oocyst viability following UV treatment suggested that a UV dose of 120 mJ/cm2 would achieve only 2\u2010log10 inactivation (Ransome et al, 1993) and that doses >8,700 mJ/cm2 were necessary for 3\u2010log10 inactivation (Campbell et al, 1995).",

Tests using exposure times expected to provide 5 mJ/cm2 achieved inactivation levels predicted for 7.5 mJ/cm2 in the reference. Although this constitutes a 50% difference, the results do indicate that the lower target doses were not overapplied by orders of magnitude. Notably, the response of the MS2 to UV doses of 10\u201350 mJ/cm2 fell within the range specified in the USEPA draft UV guidance manual (USEPA, 2003b); the response to UV doses of 10\u201340 mJ/cm2 fell within the range suggested by the National Water Research Institute and AWWA Research Foundation guidelines (NWRI/ AWWARF, 2003). These dose comparisons support the reliability of the radiometer irradiance readings and offer confidence that the reported UV doses were applied to the Cryptosporidium oocysts.",

UV doses of 10 and 40 mJ/cm2 were selected originally for all strains. Because other research has provided a large body of data for the Iowa strain in this UV dose range (Craik et al, 2001; Clancy et al, 2000; AWWARF, 2000; Bukhari et al, 1999; Finch & Belosevic, 1999), a reduced dosage range was evaluated in this study (2\u20134 mJ/cm2) to assess the effect of low UV dose for that strain. Shin and co\u2010workers (2001) showed that a low\u2010pressure UV dose of 3 mJ/cm2 resulted in 2.6\u2010log10 inactivation of the Iowa strain of C. parvum using cell culture to measure inactivation. The results in the current study showed good agreement with those data, with 3.2\u2010log10 inactivation at a UV dose of 2 mJ/cm2 and 4.1\u2010log10 inactivation at 4 mJ/cm2. The inactivation of the Moredun strain could not be precisely measured; UV doses of 10 and 40 mJ/cm2 resulted in complete loss of oocyst infectivity, yielding a value of at least 5.6\u2010log10 inactivation at 10 mJ/cm2. The TAMU strain showed >5.5\u2010log10 inactivation at 40 mJ/cm2 with a measured 5.2\u2010log10 inactivation at 10 mJ/cm2.",

These results apply only to the UV response of genotype 2 strains of C. parvum, which are capable of infecting both humans and some animals, and do not rule out the existence of some strain(s) exhibiting greater resistance to UV. However, the results do expand the under\u2010standing of the UV dose\u2013response of Cryptosporidium oocysts from a single strain to five and bolster confidence in UV technology as an effective treatment of drinking water for disinfection of Cryptosporidium.

Currently, UV dose requirements for drinking water disinfection have not been mandated by the federal government. However, USEPA is considering doses that may be <12 mJ/cm2 to achieve 3\u2010log credit for control of Cryptosporidium (Schmelling, 2002). In Austria (Austrian Standards Institute, 2001) and Germany (DVGW, 1997), doses of 40 mJ/cm2 are required when UV disinfection of drinking water is practiced. USEPA is expected to promulgate the LT2ESWTR sometime in 2004, requiring up to 2.5\u2010log10 inactivation of Cryptosporidium in addition to the physical removal achieved by coagulation and filtration processes. The findings in this study support UV as a technology capable of achieving that level of inactivation. Economic analyses suggest that the application of UV at doses as high as 40 mJ/cm2 would be cost\u2010effective relative to ozone disinfection in small (1 mgd [3.8 ML/d]) to large (>100 mgd [379 ML/d]) drinking water utilities (Cotton et al, 2001; Dyksen et al, 1998).",
