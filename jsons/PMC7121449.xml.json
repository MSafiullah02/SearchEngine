            "text": "In the last 20 years, the number of passengers traveling on planes has increased exponentially. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) along with other sources reports the number of persons traveling by air to be more than 2.5\u20133.2 billion worldwide every year, with an estimated 5% of travelers experiencing a chronic illness [1\u20134]. Although air travel is quite safe from a technical point of view, passengers are increasingly at risk during flight due to individual health problems [5]. Although air travel is growing safer and more comfortable, the increasing average age of passengers, heightened security, and stress surrounding flights and schedules, combined with the unique environment of airplanes with changes in cabin temperature, air pressure and humidity levels, narrow seats, and frequent flight delays, may result in adverse medical conditions during flights [6]. Combined with the rising number of passengers and increased capacity of larger aircraft with more long-distance domestic and international flights [2, 7], with long-haul aircrafts\u2014such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 LR now capable of extending flight times to 18\u201320 h\u2014it is likely that the incidence of in-flight medical emergencies will continue to increase in the coming years [3]. International air travel in particular combines long-haul, extended flight times with unique exposures, and an even more austere, secluded environment for passengers with acute and/or chronic illnesses, and suggests unique medical challenges for recognition, stabilization, treatment, diagnosis, and disposition.",

A study by the Medlink group (a ground-based medical consulting service for airlines) found a similar rate of response, with medical professionals responding to in-flight medical emergencies about 70% of the time [8, 16]. However, in one study, in the year ending 31 March 1999, British Airways carried 36.8 million passengers and there were 3,386 reported in-flight medical incidents: about 1 per 11,000 passengers. Although 70% were managed by cabin crew without the assistance of an onboard health professional, in almost 1,000 incidents doctors and nurses were asked to help with the management of ill passengers [17].",

The reliance of airlines on volunteer medical assistance combines with several other issues: inadequate space and seating for passengers, inadequate space to provide proper and adequate medical care, inadequate training of crew members, inadequate medical equipment, and inadequate or unclear laws pertaining to volunteer providers, crew members, airlines, and patients, especially on international flights crossing state and national borders and airline ownership; all these combine to increase difficulties of medical stabilization, treatment, diagnosis, and disposition, and even more so on long-haul, international flights [21].",

In 1998, Congress enacted the US Aviation Medical Assistance Act, which outlines protection for physicians and airlines who provide emergency medical care for passengers on commercial airliners, provided that the physician acts in good faith, receive no monetary compensation, provide reasonable care, and does not \u201cgrossly neglect\u201d the patient or commit \u201c willful misconduct.\u201d An example of such disregard would be an intoxicated physician treating a patient [46].

The study noted that each airline had its own reporting system and protocol.\nThe optimal content of first aid kits on airplanes should be determined, with a mandate that a standard kit, with identical elements, in identical locations, be on every flight [13].Even though emergency medical kits are mandated to contain certain medications and equipment, the actual kits vary from airline to airline [52, 53].\nThe training of flight attendants in how to deal with medical emergencies should be enhanced and standardized.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)mandates that flight attendants receive training \u201cto include performance drills, in the proper use of AEDs] and in CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] at least once every 24 months\u201d [52, 53]. However, the FAA \u201cdoes not require a standard curriculum or standard testing\u201d [52, 53].\nAccess of flight crews to ground-to-air medical support should be standardized.Many airlines also contract with a commercial on-ground support company that can, in theory, offer radioed, real-time medical advice [54].\n\n",
