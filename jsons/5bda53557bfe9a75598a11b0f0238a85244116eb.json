Currently, there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 based on large clinical trial data, and hence, management involves infection prevention and control measures and supportive care. With anecdotal reports and in vitro studies suggesting that certain medicines already in use for treatment of other conditions could be viable treatment options, there has been an increased demand for these therapies which could have adverse consequences on patients and healthcare systems. Toxicity from these medicines resulting from a mad rush for them at community pharmacies and pressure on physicians to prescribe for individuals who do not have the infection are worth noting. Furthermore, the indiscriminate use of these medicines could result in viral resistance as well as acute shortage such that patients who routinely take them for other conditions may not get them.",

This leaves healthcare professionals in a predicament as to deciding the best therapeutic agents to use in order to achieve optimal treatment outcomes. As a result of the self-limiting nature of most viral infections, physicians manage the symptoms and complications of infection while the patients are advised to rest and maintain good nutrition and hydration to enhance immune function [9, 10] . However, with COVID-19, there are emerging therapies which are purported to be associated with very good treatment outcomes. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) of the USA for instance has sanctioned the compassionate use of chloroquine [11] , a 4-minoquinoline medicine which has been used for many years to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and porphyria cutanea tarda even though its use in the treatment of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa was banned in the early 2000s due to the incidence of adverse reactions and resistance [12] . This compassionate approval of chloroquine as well as a statement made by President Trump on the possible benefits of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has led many into believing that chloroquine is a magical COVID-19 drug.",

Moreover, a recently conducted randomized controlled study by Gautret et al. in France showed that 100% of patients who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin tested negative and were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment [14] . Consequently, large pharmaceutical companies are considering re-positioning themselves to manufacture chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in larger volumes and seeking to establish contacts with markets where profitability could be maximized with the resulting increase in the demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Bayer and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for instance have donated chloroquine products to the USA while Mylan plans to restart production of chloroquine tablets [11] . Currently, many countries have drafted their COVID-19 treatment protocols using these medicines and there have been varying treatment outcomes which corroborate what another French study on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has found out-there is no evidence of rapid antiviral clearance or clinical benefit [15] .",

However, the authors advised that the clinical use of chloroquine should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as required by the WHO [16] . While the compassionate use of chloroquine and other medicines pending the approval of potent medicines from clinical trial data might be good news for medical professionals and COVID-19 patients, there are likely consequences these unlicensed indications could have on people who do not have the disease as well as the healthcare system. These include toxicity of medicines, shortage of medicines, and viral resistance to medicines in case they finally get approved by drug regulatory agencies.

Rather, they must be educated on approved methods of preventing the spread of the virus recommended by the WHO. In spite of the global panic to quickly resolve the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists must be vigilant and ensure rational medicine use while repurposing old remedies.",
