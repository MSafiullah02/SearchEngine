Based on these interlink relationships, personal as well as professional identity, with appropriation of social appreciated values, is established through a reciprocal process of social interaction.

We suggest a steady instillation of nursing identity into the minds of nursing students. By incorporating SARS experiences into nursing education curriculum, a sharing session is proposed to be integrated with nursing subjects such as ethics or professional development. This session will introduce students to a rich array of materials related to SARS events, including featured story and reports, thematic video.
