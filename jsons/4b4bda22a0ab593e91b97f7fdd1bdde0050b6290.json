In addition to serving as the physical barrier to these toxic agents, intact epithelia also are major sources of various macromolecules including antimicrobial agents, antioxidants and antiproteases [ 3 , 4 ] as well as proinfl ammatory cytokines and chemokines that initiate and amplify host defensive responses to these toxic agents [ 5 ] . Airway epithelial cells can be categorized as either ciliated or secretory [ 6 ] . Secretory cells, such as goblet cells and Clara cells, are responsible for the production and secretion of mucus along the apical epithelial surface and, in conjunction with ciliated cells, for the regulation of airway surface liquid viscosity. In addition, submucosal mucus glands connect to the airway lumen through a ciliated duct that propels mucins outward. These glands are present in the larger airways between bands of smooth muscle and cartilage. See Fig. 1 .",

Details of the role of airway epithelium in the host immune responses are described in a recent review [ 12 ] .

            "text": "Airway disease is a crucial pathologic component of multiple infl ammatory lung diseases (See Table 1 ). Pathologic changes in airway epithelium of COPD patients include squamous metaplasia, infl ammatory cell infi ltration, goblet cell hyperplasia, and mucus metaplasia, a process in which mucus is overproduced in response to infl ammatory stimuli (Figs. 2 and 3 ) [ 22 ] . These abnormalities are seen in both the larger central airways as well as smaller respiratory bronchioles [ 23 -26 ] . Airway infl ammation from smoking begins early in the course of the disease, and leads to persistent and progressive airway remodeling, even after smoking cessation [ 27 ] . Niewoehner et al. discovered infl ammatory changes in the peripheral airways of young smokers who died suddenly, suggesting that airway disease developed before the diagnosis of COPD could be established [ 28 ] . As further evidence of this concept, epithelial layer thickness and mucous metaplasia increase incrementally with disease severity [ 26 , 29 ] . These alterations in the epithelium increase airfl ow obstruction by several mechanisms: (1) excess mucus occludes the airway lumen [ 30 ] ; (2) epithelial layer thickening encroaches on the airway lumen, thereby reducing inner diameter [ 31 ] ; and (3) increased mucus alters surface tension of the airway, predisposing it to collapse during expiration [ 32 ] . Hogg et al. found inverse relationships between infl ammatory cell infi ltration and luminal occlusion of the small airways and lung function [ 29 ] , strongly supporting the notion that small airway pathology is responsible for severity of illness. Airway disease also has prognostic signifi cance in COPD. Mucus metaplasia in COPD has been associated with worse physiologic response to lung volume reduction surgery [ 33 ] as well as greater mortality [ 34 ] .",

These phenomena are without a doubt a result of increased airway infl ammation and worsened airfl ow obstruction, in addition to the aforementioned mechanisms. In a long term study of over 9,000 adults, an excess yearly rate of FEV 1 decline of 12.6-22.8 mL was attributed to chronic mucus hypersecretion [ 21 ] . We have found chronic cough and sputum production in patients with severe COPD were associated with higher dyspnea scores and more upper airway symptoms [ 43 , 48 ] . In multiple studies, patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD were found to be at a 1.20-1.92-fold increased risk for COPD exacerbation compared to those without chronic bronchitis [ 43 -47 ] . The cause of the observed increase in allcause mortality, however, is still a matter of debate. It is hypothesized that the increased lung infl ammation associated with chronic bronchitis causes greater systemic infl ammation, resulting in numerous downstream consequences, including coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and skeletal muscle weakness [ 50 ] . In the Tucson Epidemiological Survey of Airway Obstructive Disease, chronic bronchitis was associated with a 2.2-fold greater risk of all-cause mortality in those under the age of 50, and was also associated with higher serum levels of IL-8 and C-reactive protein at enrollment [ 49 ] .",

Large airway goblet cell hyperplasia and smooth muscle hypertrophy are prominent pathologic features of asthma. Goblet cell hyperplasia is more consistently seen in asthma compared to COPD, where clinical and pathologic phenotype is a highly variable combination of airway disease and emphysema. In asthma, mucus hypersecretion leads to obstruction of the majority of distal airways and ultimately respiratory failure during fatal asthma exacerbations [ 55 ] . Diffuse occlusion of the small and medium sized airways by mucus and cellular debris has been demonstrated in multiple autopsy studies of patients who died from asthma [ 56 , 57 ] .

Strict regulation of mucus production is indispensable for normal lung function. The protective function of mucus depends on its proper composition of constituent components, particularly mucin glycoproteins. Mucins are high molecular weight proteins with O-glycosidic linkages between the fi rst GalNAc residue of the oligosaccharide side chains and serine and threonine amino acids of the polypeptide backbone. Over 20 mucin (MUC in human, Muc in animals) genes have been cloned, 12 of which are expressed in the lung [ 2 , 60 ] . The airway mucin include secreted gene products (MUC2, 5AC, 5B, 7, 8, and 19) and membrane-tethered mucins (MUC1, 4, 11, 13, 16, and 20) . MUC5AC and MUC5B are the two major secretory mucins in the respiratory tract. The levels of these mucins in mucus have been shown to signifi cantly increase, and to directly correlate with, the number of goblet cells under the pathological conditions of goblet cell metaplasia or goblet cell hyperplasia. Although the exact roles of MUC5AC and MUC5B in the airways remain to be fully elucidated, it has been suggested that MUC5AC expression is inducible during airway infl ammation, whereas MUC5B expression is constitutive [ 61 ] . A recent report supports this notion by demonstrating that MUC5AC levels correlated with the degree of airway obstruction in COPD patients [ 62 ] . Cystic fi brosis, in contrast, is characterized by greater MUC5B levels compared to MUC5AC [ 63 , 64 ] , suggesting that impaired mucociliary clearance is the principal mechanism responsible for the overwhelming burden of mucus in these patients.",

            "text": "TLRs, and related molecules, on airway epithelial cells comprise a second line of defense against inhaled microbial pathogens [ 65 ] . These pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) constitute an evolutionary conserved family of gene products that interact with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to initiate downstream signal transduction and innate infl ammatory responses. In general, all TLRs possess a leucine-rich repeat region in their ectodomains and an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. TLR signaling is activated by agonist-induced receptor homodimerization, recruitment of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins (MyD88, TIRAP, TRIF) to the TIR domain, and activation of protein kinases (IRAKs, TRAF6) [ 66 ] . Although all of the 10 known human TLRs are expressed by airway epithelial cells, TLR2 and TLR5 are the predominant respiratory PRRs [ 67 , 68 ] . TLR5 engages fl agellin, the major protein component of the bacterial fl agellum, while TLR2 recognizes a diverse array of components from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including lipoproteins and peptidoglycan. It remains unclear how a single receptor (TLR2) can recognize such a broad diversity of stimuli, but a possible explanation is the ability of TLR2 to form heterodimers with TLR1 and TLR6. For example, bacterial peptidoglycan interacted with the TLR2/6 co-receptor complex on airway epithelial cells to activate NF-\u03baB and stimulate production of TNF-\u03b1 [ 69 ] . The magnitude of the response generated by the TLR2/6 heterodimer was greater than that produced by TLR2 alone. While TLR5 homodimers are clearly capable of binding to fl agellin, Mizel et al. [ 70 ] reported that nitric oxide production by airway epithelial cells in response to fl agellin was dependent on interaction of TLR5 with TLR4. TLR2 also was shown to be involved in signaling induced by fl agellin in human airway epithelial cells, suggesting a possible TLR2/TLR5 heterodimer interaction [ 67 ] . Biotinylation of surface proteins of airway epithelial cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both TLR2 and TLR5 were associated with the ganglioside, asialoGM1, in the plasma membrane [ 71 ] . IRAK1 and TRAF6 were also found in the co-receptor complex, whereas TLR4 was not. Furthermore, treatment of airway epithelial cells with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pili or fl agella mobilized asialoGM1, TLR2, and TLR5 to the apical surface of the cells leading to Ca +2 -associated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB, and production of IL-8 [ 67 ] . These combined results indicate that TLRs link the asialoGM1 glycoconjugate to intracellular signal transduction leading to a proinfl ammatory host response following interaction with bacterial components. Other groups, however, have questioned the role of asialoGM1 as a cell surface receptor for P. aeruginosa , particularly clinical isolates of the bacterium [ 72 ] .",

The anti-microbial function of these immune cells is directly mediated through phagocytosis, and indirectly by the release of antimicrobial agents [ 73 ] . Among the soluble mediators released by neutrophils is the serine protease, neutrophil elastase (NE). Studies using NE knockout mice showed that this protease is required for host defense against experimental infection by Gram-negative bacteria [ 74 ] . However, the role of NE in the normal lung response to spontaneous bacterial infection needs to be more fi rmly established. Some evidence suggests that NE promotes neutrophil migration into the lung by degradation of the extracellular matrix, but this remains controversial [ 75 ] . In general, NE is considered as a proinfl ammatory molecule, and NE chemical inhibitors decrease infl ammation and lung edema in animal models [ 76 ] . Part of the mechanism through which NE mediates its anti-microbial effects is up-regulation of mucin secretion by goblet cells [ 77 ] . Using a co-culture system containing neutrophils and primary tracheal epithelial cells, Kim et al. [ 78 ] demonstrated that activation by fMLP/cytochalasin B resulted not only in increased NE production by neutrophils, but also greater mucin release from the epithelial cells. Both effects were blocked in a dosedependent fashion by pretreatment with \u03b11-protease inhibitor, implicating a proteolytic effect of NE on the epithelial cells. Kohri et al. [ 79 ] reported that NE treatment of NCI-H292 airway epithelial cells stimulated the production of MUC5AC mucin through transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1)-dependent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Park et al. [ 80 ] showed that NE treatment of well-differentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) increased the release of MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins via an intracellular signaling pathway involving protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4). To date, NE is the most potent mucin secretagogue described.",

This balance ensures that harmful environmental insults are effectively neutralized without excessive bystander tissue damage. Although a large body of literature has characterized the microbial-stimulated pro-infl ammatory pathways summarized above, relatively less is known about the compensatory anti-infl ammatory responses. Nevertheless, it is hypothesized that failure to down-regulate airway infl ammation results in the development of acute or chronic respiratory diseases, including COPD, CF, ARDS, and asthma [ 25 ] . A number of anti-infl ammatory molecules have been shown to play an important role in controlling the normal infl ammatory response in the lung, including IL-10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), peroxisome proliferator activating receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3, and Mucin-1 (MUC1) [ 25 , 81 , 82 ] . However, what is less clear is whether defective expression and/or structure/function of these, or related, anti-infl ammatory mediators is responsible for the etiopathogenesis of infl ammatory lung diseases. The following sections briefl y describe each of these key anti-infl ammatory mediators with the goal of stimulating further basic and clinical research on their role in airway infl ammatory diseases.",

IL-10 also enhances B cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production. These pleiotropic effects are mediated through interaction of the IL-10 homodimer with its cognate IL-10 receptor \u03b1 subunit (IL-10R\u03b1), and subsequent binding of this ligand-receptor complex to the IL-10R2 co-receptor. An accumulating body of evidence points toward a role for IL-10 in chronic infl ammation during COPD and asthma [ 84 , 85 ] , although a direct causal effect for IL-10 in the pathogenesis of these disorders is unclear. In the case of CF, airway secretions from affl icted patients, as well as CFTR \u2212/\u2212 mice, have decreased IL-10 levels compared with secretions from normal individuals or CFTR +/+ mice [ 82 ] .",

Additional evidence supporting an anti-infl ammatory role for TGF-\u03b2 comes from the observation that intratracheal delivery of TGF-\u03b2 suppressed allergen-induced airway infl ammation in a murine model of asthma [ 87 ] . Increased airway infl ammation also was evident upon inhibition of TGF-\u03b2-dependent intracellular signaling [ 88 ] . Genetic studies have demonstrated an association between gene polymorphisms of the TGF-\u03b2 locus and COPD [ 89 ] .

PPARs form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors that regulate gene transcription. PPAR\u03b3 is expressed as two isoforms, PPAR\u03b31 and PPAR\u03b32, that differ by the presence of a unique 30 amino acid segment in the latter [ 91 ] . PPAR\u03b32 is primarily expressed in adipose tissue, while PPAR\u03b31 is expressed in the lung, heart, skeletal muscle, intestine, kidney, pancreas, spleen, breast, and lymphoid tissues [ 92 ] . Both PPAR\u03b3 molecules are activated by prostanoids, a subclass of eicosanoids consisting of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins. Synthetic PPAR\u03b3 ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones [ 93 ] , have been developed that suppress infl ammation both in vitro and in vivo [ 94 , 95 ] , including in response to lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 96 ] , the major bacterial species that is responsible for the morbidity and mortality of CF. In the case of CF, at least three lines of evidence have been reported for an anti-infl ammatory role for PPAR-\u03b3. First, PPAR-\u03b3 inhibits airway infl ammation by competitively inhibiting NF-\u03baB binding to gene promoters, thereby blocking the activation of proinfl ammatory cytokines [ 97 ] . Second, PPAR-\u03b3 expression is decreased in lung of CFTR \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with CFTR +/+ mice [ 98 ] . Finally, CF airway epithelial cell lines have reduced PPAR-\u03b3 levels compared with normal cells [ 99 ] . Thus, decreased PPAR-\u03b3 expression likely contributes to defective NF-\u03baB signaling that favors increased airway infl ammation in CF, and possibly other infl ammatory airway diseases.

The two polypeptide structure of MUC1 arises as a consequence of proteolysis within the SEA domain [ 102 ] . MUC1 is unique among the membrane-bound mucins because its CT region constitutes a signal transduction domain. The CT contains multiple amino acid sequence motifs predicted as binding sites for Shc, c-Src, Grb-2, \u03b2-catenin, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [ 25 ] .

Given that the host responses to lung pathogens involves the expression of multiple PAMPs, which must be activated and regulated in response to infection, this fi nding suggests a crucial role for MUC1/Muc1 in the resolution of infl ammation, and perhaps in the genesis of chronic infl ammatory disorders, such as COPD, CF and asthma.",

            "text": "Given the anti-infl ammatory role of MUC1 in the airways, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which MUC1 gene expression is regulated. Several proinfl ammatory cytokines have been shown to up-regulate MUC1 expression. Noteworthy in this regard is TNF-\u03b1. Skerrett et al. [ 111 ] reported that TNFR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice treated intranasally with P. aeruginosa showed signifi cantly increased airway infl ammation compared with wild type mice, as measured by enhanced bacterial clearance from the lungs, increased numbers of neutrophils in BALF, and higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 in BALF. Subsequently, TNF-\u03b1 was demonstrated to stimulate MUC1 expression in A549 lung epithelial cells [ 107 , 112 ] . The molecular mechanism of TNF-\u03b1-induced MUC1 up-regulation has been described in detail using a combination of biochemical, pharmacological, and molecular biological approaches [ 107 ] . The requirement for TNF-\u03b1 in increased MUC1 expression has also been observed in A549 cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [ 109 ] , as well as in mice infected with P. aeruginosa [ 113 ] . Thus, these results suggest that TNF-\u03b1 may play a key role in controlling infl ammation during airway infection, from the initiation phase of bacterial exposure to the fi nal resolution of infl ammation, the latter likely by inducing the expression of key anti-infl ammatory molecules, such as MUC1, with possible assistance by IL-10 and/or PPAR-\u03b3.",

            "text": "Based on the accumulated published literature, we propose the following model to account for MUC1, TLRs, and TNF-\u03b1 in the airway epithelial response to respiratory infection [ 25 ] . Normally, transiently inspired pathogens are quickly removed by mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis by resident leukocytes in the airway lumen. With abnormally high pathogen load, for example due to a predisposing condition such as CF, microbial PAMPs activate TLRs resulting in the production of proinfl ammatory mediators (IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1), thereby promoting leukocyte infl ux into the airways. During the early stage of infection, MUC1 expression is suffi ciently low and TLR signaling is not antagonized. However, after invading pathogens have been cleared, increased levels of infl ammatory products such as neutrophil elastase and TNF-\u03b1 up-regulate MUC1 expression which, in turn, suppresses the release of TNF-\u03b1, thus inhibiting TLR-dependent airway infl ammation. The net effect facilitates pathogen removal and returns the lungs to homeostasis. Future experiments are needed to provide additional support for this proposed negative feed-back loop model system.",

[ 114 ] demonstrated that intratracheal LPS-induced neutrophilic infl ammation in rats can be inhibited by intratracheal administration of soluble TNFR, suggesting that TNF/TNFR interaction plays a key role in LPS-induced airway neutrophilic infl ammation. Interestingly, TNFR1 defi cient mice not only failed to control either LPS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa -induced neutrophilic infl ammation [ 111 ] but showed greater neutrophilic infl ammation to the contrary. Recently Choi et al. [ 113 ] showed that Muc1 \u2212/\u2212 mice behaves exactly the similar way as TNFR defi cient mice in response to airway Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, i.e., an increased neutrophilc infl ammation, compared with their WT Muc1 +/+ mice. The relationship between TNFR and Muc1 can be explained by Koga et al. [ 107 ] who demonstrated that the levels of MUC1 are controlled by the TNF/TNFR signaling pathway. Thus, MUC1/Muc1 seems to be controlled mainly by TNF both in vivo [ 113 ] and in vitro [ 107 ] . This timely regulation of infl ammation and its resolution has also been demonstrated in vivo between TNF and IL-10, in which the former induces the latter, one of the major anti-infl ammatory molecule [ 115 ] . Thus, failure to induce sufficient levels of anti-infl ammatory molecules in a timely manner during the course of lung infl ammation will result in lung tissue damage, and the subsequent repair processes will result in lung remodeling, a major characteristic of infl ammatory lung diseases such as COPD and CF. Whether other anti-infl ammatory molecules are also controlled through the similar mechanism remains to be elucidated.",

Their primary role in the process of host defense becomes dysregulated, and the excess infl ammation causes increased mucus production and hypersecretion, resulting in mucostasis, airway obstruction, and tissue remodeling from several downstream events. Clinical consequences include an accelerated decline in lung function, greater respiratory symtoms, exacerbations of underlying lung disease, recurrent lower respiratory tract infection, and higher mortality. Multiple complex interactions between infl ammatory cytokines and epithelial cells exist, and the precise roles of each in the generation of mucins and the amplifi cation of lung infl ammation remain unclear. There is, however, emerging evidence that the role of MUC1 mucin is essential to the airway epithelium's response to environmental toxic agents, and therefore essential to the development of chronic and persistent infl ammation. Further studies are required to better understand the roles of this mucin as well as others in the pathogenesis of infl ammatory lung disease.",
