Across the country certainly, there was much attention at the local level devoted to the development of emergency response plans for infectious diseases, and Alberta was no exception. However, this continued preparedness was not prioritized in the run up to the complex restructuring of health services in Alberta in 2008-2009. 3 Only two reviews of the Alberta experience have been published-one commissioned by the government 3 and the other focused on surveillance. 4 In this retrospective, the authors draw from these and their own personal recollections and reflect on challenges experienced and opportunities presented during the AHS PI response related particularly to the coordination of public health, emergency and disaster management, communications, and health services delivery.

Although a provincial Emergency/ Disaster Management (E/DM) program had been approved and funded early in the inception of AHS, establishment had yet to occur. Challenges arose related to the coordination of multiple legacy jurisdictions with no established incident management structure, processes, or defined roles and responsibilities that would facilitate the new organization working together. For Wave I, AHS' internal response was reliant upon legacy RHAs' PI preparedness (including stockpiling of PI supplies), which had been organized independently, planned differently, and were at varied levels of readiness. In the absence of an AHS Incident Management System (IMS), an ad hoc AHS Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was established and co-located with the AHW EOC, to facilitate sharing of information, planning, decision-making, and communication required to support a coordinated, provincial Wave I response.",

The AHS command and control structure included an Executive Policy Group, AHS provincial Emergency Coordination Centre, five Zone EOCs, and numerous site and service command posts, that provided strong and consistent support to operations and the frontline staff and enabled a more effective, timely and provincially collaborative management of Wave II.

However, as identified in the review of the Alberta response to the PI by the Health Quality Council of Alberta, communications challenges remained both between AHS and AHW, and between central AHS leadership and the zones. Feedback provided by zone respondents was that at times the efforts to achieve consistency across the province did not take into account local nuances of geography and resources-the \"one size fits all\" approach chafed. 3 The PI response experience provided an opportunity for AHS and AHW to enhance their separate and collective performance. Post PI, AHS, AHW, and AEMA developed a tripartite Alberta Pandemic Influenza Plan that aligned with the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Planning Guidance for the Health Sector. Alberta Health Services adopted an \"all hazard\" approach to emergency planning and management supported by a committee structure with oversight for the development of functional operational plans that are flexible and scalable and can be adapted to any situation.

A combined team from AHW and AHS quickly developed preliminary guidance documents for the pandemic strain, including a requirement for CD professionals to collect and report individual hospitalized case data through enhanced surveillance. This ensured a standardized approach and helped to inform the development of the national pandemic guidelines. The fact of the incompatibilities of the various legacy systems of the former RHAs, including those of both public health and acute care, plus the repeated changes in official nomenclature of the pandemic strain, presented huge challenges to the team with resultant inefficiencies and gaps. An additional challenge that biased the available data toward the urban centres was the centralization of respiratory virus laboratory testing in Calgary and Edmonton, so that results from rural areas were delayed. However, the resulting situational reports were very useful in informing decision-makers and triggering interventions such as the opening of the influenza assessment centres and mass immunization clinics, plus the proactive increase in emergency and hospital staffing, and release of antiviral medications. 4 The Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab) was a key contributor to the surveillance activity. Prior to the pandemic, the ProvLab had been transitioning from viral culture techniques to molecular-based assays that could handle greater volumes with similar labour resources and yield reported results in a fraction of the time. These preparations were timely and valuable, as the ProvLab was the first diagnostic laboratory in Canada to provide subtype determinations for the pandemic strain, apart from the National Microbiology Laboratory.",

When it became apparent (only 4 days after the opening of the public immunization clinics) that the supply of adjuvanted vaccine was to be temporarily slowed nationally, the public health team recommended a one day closure of the clinics to permit a refocusing of the program. However, AHW made the decision to keep the clinics closed for 4 days and then reopen to a gradual progression of high-risk groups. Only quite late in the rollout of the immunization program when demand for vaccine had decreased substantially were arrangements finalized to enable pharmacists, community physicians, and paramedics and to also provide the vaccine.",

They also, using a clinical database in use in Calgary, adapted a national futility rating tool to fit their experience which enabled a more aggressive approach to care in some cases.

Unification of all health services under AHS clearly provided the opportunity to become the go-to authoritative source, and the manner in which the Chief MOH (within AHW) and the Senior MOH (within AHS) worked together to brief the public and health professionals was exemplary. Still, issues of timeliness, accountability, and emphasis were common at all levels and between all stakeholders, contributing to errors, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities. That AHS was the lead agency most obviously responsible for responding to the PI made it an easy target for criticism in the media, which likely contributed to a risk aversion position that extended from the political to the frontlines. For example, the early huge demand for vaccine, the expectation to avoid long clinic queues, and the evolving list of eligible risk groups all combined almost paradoxically to yield lower than expected vaccine coverage and high vaccine wastage.",
