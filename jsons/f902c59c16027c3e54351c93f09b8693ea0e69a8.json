Viral 'fusion proteins' facilitate this process. They vary greatly in structure, but all seem to have a common mechanism of action, in which a ligand-triggered, large-scale conformational change in the fusion protein is coupled to apposition and merger of the two bilayers. We describe three examples-the influenza virus hemagglutinin, the flavivirus E protein and the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-in some detail, to illustrate the ways in which different structures have evolved to implement this common mechanism. Fusion inhibitors can be effective antiviral agents.",

Moreover, they all happen to be trimeric in their fusion-active state. In the initial step in the fusion reaction, the fusion protein, responding to binding of a ligand (protons in many cases, as the mechanism has evolved to respond to the low pH of an endosome 3, 4 , but cellular or viral protein ligands in other cases), undergoes a conformational change that extends each subunit toward the target membrane and yields a contact between that membrane and the fusion peptide or loop(s) (Fig. 1a to Fig. 1b) . Many fusion proteins are C-terminal fragments of a larger precursor (for example, the HA2 fragment of influenza virus hemagglutinin or the gp41 fragment of HIV Env), and initiating the fusion process requires that they must first shed their N-terminal fragment, which often contains a receptor-binding domain (for example, HA1 or gp120-see the more detailed description of influenza virus hemagglutinin below). Although strong, the evidence for an extended intermediate is indirect. The putative extended state is sometimes called a 'pre-hairpin intermediate' , as the next step is collapse into a folded-back conformation. The intermediate may have a relatively long half-life; for HIV-1 gp41, the half-life seems to be many minutes, but in other cases, it may only be a few seconds.",

In most cases, steps 3 and 4 probably require concerted action of more than one 'Enveloped' viruses-those with lipid bilayers as integral parts of their structure-enter the cells they infect by fusion of viral and host-cell membranes. One or more viral membrane proteins facilitate the various fusion steps. Several such fusion proteins have now been studied in great detail, with crystal structures determined for both the form of the protein present on the viral surface before interaction with the cell ('pre-fusion' conformation) and the form of the protein after fusion is complete ('post-fusion' conformation). The proteins show a variety of molecular architectures, but what we can infer from the various structures and from experiments both in solution and with cells suggests that all of them catalyze fusion in essentially the same way. We can even draw a rough analogy to serine proteases, which can have very different polypeptide chain folds but identical active-site mechanisms.",

Fusogens of all kinds lower that kinetic barrier; viral fusion proteins do so by using the free energy liberated during a protein conformational change to draw the membranes together. The general outlines of the pathway leading from two separate bilayers to a single one is relatively well understood (Fig. 1) . A 'hemifusion' state-in which the apposed, proximal leaflets of the two bilayers, but not yet the distal leaflets, have merged-is almost certainly an obligatory intermediate. The structure of the hemifusion intermediate is probably stalk-like (Fig. 1d) . Studies of fusion mediated by viral proteins provide some of the best evidence for hemifusion as a required intermediate stage 1 . There are probably substantial kinetic barriers both leading into this intermediate and leading away from it toward the product (Fig. 2) .",

The crystal structure of its ectodomain in a prefusion conformation was determined in classic work by Wiley, Wilson and Skehel in 1981 (refs. 18,19) ; the post-fusion conformation was finally visualized in 1994 (ref. 20), and the uncleaved precursor, HA0, in 1998 (ref. 21). The core of HA1 is a sialic acid-binding domain, borne on a stalk formed by HA2. The central feature of the stalk is a three-chain, \u03b1-helical coiled coil. HA0 and its cleaved product, prefusion HA1-HA2, are essentially identical in overall structure. The cleavage, which normally happens in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but which can also occur after viral budding, leads to a modest local rearrangement, in which the newly generated N terminus of HA2 inserts into a pocket along the three-fold axis, burying the fusion peptide (the first 20-25 residues of HA2). The pocket is created by a splaying apart from each other of the C termini of the HA2 coiled-coil helices, so that the three helices diverge from the three-fold axis and from each other, rather like a narrow tripod (Fig. 3a) .",

As the plasma membrane recycles regularly through various forms of endocytosis, the virus-receptor complex may not require a specific endocytic signal in order to reach an endosome. When the HA1:HA2 trimer encounters low pH, it undergoes a large-scale conformational rearrangement, in which HA1 separates from HA2 ( Fig. 3a to Fig. 3b) , except for a residual disulfide tether, and the latter effectively turns inside out 20,23,24 . The two key features of this HA2 refolding are a loop-to-helix transition 25 in the region connecting the fusion peptide to the central coiled coil (Fig. 3b to  Fig. 3c) and reorientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule so that it zips up alongside the extended coil ( Fig. 3c to Fig. 3d) . These correspond, respectively, to formation of the extended intermediate and to its collapse into a conformation that brings together the fusion peptide and the transmembrane anchor. The loop-to-helix transition in the N-terminal part of HA2 augments the central coiled-coil at its N-terminal end (Fig. 3c) ; reorientation of the C-terminal part of the protein breaks the central helices where they splay apart, at the site fusion-protein trimer (as symbolized by the two apposed trimers in Fig. 1 ). The number of trimers that participate and the nature of the interaction that couples them may vary from case to case, and these issues are still matters of some debate.",

That is, each HA2 chain can complete its refolding independently of the other two, and the loss of overall three-fold symmetry during the transition (Fig. 1c,d) is a natural consequence of this independence. Formation of the cap structure ( Fig. 3e) restores global three-fold symmetry; if the transmembrane helices pass completely through the bilayer, this step probably requires the presence of an aqueous channel-that is, a committed fusion pore (Fig. 1e) .",

In the fully rearranged, low-pH conformation (Figs. 5d,e) , the C-terminal segment has zipped up along the fusion domains, much as in the flavivirus fusion transition. Aside from this zipping up of the C terminus, the most pronounced conformational change is the loop-tohelix transition of the 12-residue segment between the fusion domains and the core domain ( Fig. 5b to Fig. 5c , blue helix), reminiscent of the even more notable loop-to-helix transition in influenza HA2. As in hemagglutinin, the loop-to-helix transition in VSV-G creates a long, three-chain coiled coil at the trimer axis and seems to propel the fusion loops toward the target membrane. The herpesvirus fusion protein, gB, is a 'stretched' version of VSV-G 40 . This unexpected similarity between fusion proteins of a DNA virus and a negative-strand RNA virus has led to some evolutionary speculations, but the important result from the point of view of understanding fusion mechanisms is that information about one protein (for example, glycoprotein (G) of rhabdoviruses (for example, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus) seems to be reversible 38 .

The hemagglutinins of many influenza strains undergo just this kind of inactivation when the pH is lowered in the absence of attachment to a target membrane. One possibility is that on the viral surface, the protein can shift reversibly between the states represented by Figure 5b and Figure 5c , but insertion of the fusion loops into a target membrane somehow favors the further (irreversible?) transition to the state in Figure 5d .",

The post-fusion conformation of the gp41 ectodomain is particularly simple-just a trimer of hairpins, in which both prongs of the hairpin are \u03b1-helices [49] [50] [51] (Fig. 6) . Approximately 50 residues immediately C-terminal to the fusion peptide (designated HR1, where \"HR\" stands for \"heptad repeats\") form a central, three-chain coiled coil. A loop that contains a conserved disulfide bond connects the HR1 segment to a second heptad-repeat element, HR2, which forms an outer-layer \u03b1-helix. Peptides from this outer layer can inhibit the fusion process 52, 53 . The mechanism involves association of the peptide with the inner core, preventing transition to the post-fusion conformation. The lifetime of the intermediate, as detected by the capacity of such peptides to inhibit fusion during the period after attachment and initiation of conformation change, is at least several minutes 54 ; its magnitude is probably determined by the resistance of the two membranes to being pulled toward each other. Without that resistance, the zipping up of the outer layer might be too rapid for peptide to intervene. HIV fusion occurs at the cell surface, and one such inhibitory peptide (T-20, or enfuvirtide) is a clinically useful drug 55 . Mutations conferring resistance to T-20 can occur at various positions in the envelope protein, including residues in gp120 (ref. 56) . Some of the mutations in HR1 that reduce T-20 binding also retard fusion and enhance sensitivity to antibodies targeting the membrane-proximal region of gp41 (ref. 57 ). There is also biochemical evidence that the extended intermediate is the target for this set of neutralizing antibodies 58 .",

The energy barrier that must be overcome en route to a hemifusion stalk is thought to be about ~40-50 kcal mol -1 (refs. 2,5) .

How a binding-induced conformational change in gD leads to the reorganization of gB remains to be worked out.

Priming is usually the result of proteolysis-either of the fusion protein itself, as in the case of influenza hemagglutinin or retroviral Env, or of an accompanying protein, as in the case of flavi-and alphaviruses. For these viruses, priming occurs during transport of the immature glycoprotein to the cell surface, either before assembly of the virus particle by budding at the cell surface or after a formation of an immature particle by budding through an internal membrane. The glycoproteins of other viruses-Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in particular-require cleavage by endosomal cathepsins B or L during cell entry rather than during maturation 42, 43 . The SARS coronavirus spike protein, S, is a trimer of uncleaved chains on the virion surface, but receptor binding seems to make it susceptible to cathepsin L (ref. 43 ). In addition to making the fusogenic conformational rearrangement possible, cathepsin attack, by releasing a covalent constraint, may also be sufficient to induce the rearrangement-that is, cleavage may be a triggering as well as a priming step, after a 'pre-priming' by the receptor interaction. The Ebola virus glycoprotein, GP0, is cleaved by furin to GP1 and GP2 before incorporation into virions. Degradation of GP1 by cathepsins may be part of the triggering step, to release GP2 from the constraints that prevent its fusogenic conformational rearrangement, but some further endosomal activity seems to be required as well 44 .",

Once that covalent restraint has gone (irreversibly), a high kinetic barrier still separates the primed from the post-fusion conformation. The trigger that lowers this barrier (or provides the required activation energy) can be binding of a proton, for viruses that have evolved to detect a low-pH, endosomal environment, or binding of a co-receptor in some other cases (for example, HIV-1); for herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses, the trigger is an altered lateral contact with another viral surface protein that has itself changed conformation because of binding with a cellular receptor.

For flavivirus E proteins, the initial dissociation of the dimer probably allows the monomer to flex outward, encounter the target membrane and associate into trimers 36 (Fig. 4b-d) . Soluble E ectodomain dimers dissociate reversibly at low pH and redimerize if the pH is returned to neutral.

Deformation of a planar membrane into a nipple-like bud (Fig. 1c) creates a nearly hemispherical cap, with roughly uniform positive curvature, and a flared region joining it to the planar membrane of the membrane. The flared region has positive curvature in one direction (around the axis of the nipple) and negative in the other (within the plane of the cross-section in Fig. 1c) , and hence little net elastic distortion. Using reasonable dimensions for the bud 5 , one can estimate the difference in area between the inner and outer leaflets of the positively curved cap as 2 \u00d7 10 4 \u00c5 2 . Available structural data show that fusion loops and fusion peptides insert only partway into the outer leaflet of the target membrane, displacing lipid head groups laterally and therefore favoring curvature of the leaflet 11,17,27 . But their contribution is probably only a modest fraction of the total curvature in the cap. For example, the tip of one flavivirus trimer occupies about 800 \u00c5 2 . Hence, insertion of the tips of even five or six trimers will provide only 20%-25% of the required distortion. The direction of curvature promoted by the observed insertion does suggest, however, that as the extended intermediates collapse, their fusion peptides or fusion loops may tend to concentrate in the positively curved cap and migrate toward the developing hemifusion stalk. At this stage, they may contribute substantially to the difference between the areas of the inner and outer leaflets.",

The membrane-proximal segments (10-15 residues) of many fusion-protein ectodomains have characteristic hydrophobic and often relatively tryptophan-rich sequences. At the end of the fusioninducing conformational change, these segments are apposed to the merged membrane and could in principle interact with the membrane or the fusion peptides/loops (or both). The membrane-proximal segments of influenza virus hemagglutinin might have a defined role in stabilizing the final, post-fusion structure (and hence potentially in stabilizing an open fusion pore) (Fig. 3e) . The membrane-proximal region of HIV gp41 has been studied with particular attention, as it is the target of two well-characterized, broadly neutralizing antibodies, both of which seem to target the extended intermediate rather than the pre-fusion envelope trimer. Some recent NMR experiments suggest that it could form a bent amphipathic helix lying in the outer part of the membrane bilayer 62 .",

If influenza virus hemagglutinin is linked to a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor or to a truncated protein anchor that does not completely traverse the membrane, the fusion process halts at hemifusion and proceeds forward very slowly [63] [64] [65] . It thus seems that collapse of the extended intermediate-the transition that induces hemifusion-stalk formation-is not sufficient to drive the fusion process to completion. At the hemifusion stage, a hemagglutinin-Cell-cell fusion mediated by influenza virus hemagglutinin responds nonlinearly to the concentration of hemagglutinin on the cell surface, in a manner consistent with cooperativity in fusion-pore formation 59 . An estimate obtained from analysis of the lag time to fusion (after a drop in pH) for red blood cells with hemagglutinin-expressing cells suggests that three or four hemagglutinin trimers might participate in a single fusion event. As the resistance of the two membranes to deformation and the height of the kinetic barrier leading to hemifusion will probably change with membrane composition, it is likely that the actual number of hemagglutinin trimers required will vary from cell type to cell type.",

Experiments with HIV and HIV pseudotypes containing a mixture of cleavable and uncleavable (and hence active and inactive) fusion proteins suggest that only one active retroviral envelope trimer is sufficient for fusion, while confirming the requirement for several hemagglutinin trimers 60 . The fusion proteins of HIV and other retroviruses may have evolved to manage with a single fusion protein, as the complement of trimers on the virion surface can be rather sparse: estimates of 15-20 trimers total have been made for HIV. Rough calculations based on the known (K d \u2248 1 nM) affinity of an HIV gp41 outer-layer peptide for a trimeric inner core suggest that the free energy liberated during collapse of the extended intermediate to the folded-back trimer of hairpins might approach the estimate of ~40-50 kcal mol -1 for the hemifusion barrier.",

A specific structure for such a ring has been proposed for the alphavirus fusion protein 17 . Lateral contacts would couple the conformational change of one trimer to that in another, as in allosteric regulation of multi-subunit enzymes. The other mechanism, which induced fusion pore can flicker open and closed 6 , and we may infer that some property of the fusion protein, connected with complete traversal of the membrane, must accelerate the forward reaction. The capping of the central helix in influenza HA2 (Fig. 3e) shows that formation of a well-defined structure, with tight hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions among the participating amino acid residues, brings about a concerted closure of the conformational transition, drawing the near ends of the transmembrane helices together and causing the cytoplasmic segments on the opposite side of the membrane to pass into or through the nascent fusion pore 24 . Presence of these segments in the aqueous channel of a fusion pore will prevent its resealing and may explain how a cytoplasmic element at the far end of the transmembrane anchor can drive the fusion process forward 65 . In other words, formation of a cap on the HA2 helical bundle when zipping-up is complete becomes a mechanism for making pore formation irreversible 28 because cap formation couples to a translocation, into or through the pore, of material from the cytoplasmic face of the bilayer.",

            "text": "Ligands can retard or block viral entry if they bind selectively to any conformation of the fusion protein that precedes, in the fusion pathway, merger of the two bilayers. For example, inhibition of fusion is a mechanism by which some neutralizing antibodies block viral infection. T-20, the outer-layer peptide from HIV gp41 described above, demonstrates that agents selected or designed to inhibit the fusion-inducing conformational change can be useful in the clinic 55 . Small molecules have been found that block HIV fusion, by screening for compounds that compete with an outer-layer peptide for binding to the three-helix bundle of the post-fusion gp41 inner core 66 . It might be possible to extend this strategy to many other viruses, as zipping up of an outer-layer segment against the inner core of an intermediate is a universal feature of the fusioninducing conformational changes illustrated in Figures 3-6 . Small molecules have also been found that bind HIV gp120 in its prefusion conformation, thereby raising the barrier to the initial steps of the fusion sequence 67 . The site for these molecules is probably a pocket in gp120 that closes up in the initial, CD4-induced conformational transition 68 . Productive receptor binding must expel the compound from this site and thus incur an inhibitor-specific free-energy cost. A candidate has been described for a similar kind of site on dengue virus E-a pocket that disappears when the protein starts to rearrange 10 . Indeed, any protein that undergoes a large-scale conformational change is likely to have some sort of small-molecule binding site that changes or disappears in the transition from one state to the other. We need now to understand when it is practical to exploit this property for discovery of useful compounds. A structure-based, mechanistic analysis of membrane fusion, as outlined in this review, can clearly contribute to the discovery process.",

Sequence of events in membrane fusion promoted by a viral fusion protein. Ambiguities remain in some aspects of this scheme (see main text). (a) The protein in the pre-fusion conformation, with its fusion peptide or loop (light green) sequestered. The representation is purely schematic, and various features of specific proteins are not incorporated-for example, the displacement of the N-terminal fragment of proteins that are cleaved from a precursor or the dimer-to-trimer rearrangement on the surface of flaviviruses. (b) Extended intermediate. The protein opens up, extending the fusion peptide or loop to interact with the target bilayer. The part of the protein that bears the fusion peptide forms a trimer cluster. (c) Collapse of the extended intermediate: a C-terminal segment of the protein folds back along the outside of the trimer core. The segments from the three subunits fold back independently, so that at any point in the process they can extend to different distances along the trimer axis, and the entire trimer can bow outward, away from the deforming membrane. (d) Hemifusion. When collapse of the intermediate has proceeded far enough to bring the two bilayers into contact, the apposed, proximal leaflets merge into a hemifusion stalk. (e) Fusion pore formation. As the hemifused bilayers open into a fusion pore, the final zipping up of the C-terminal ectodomain segments snaps the refolded trimer into its fully symmetric, post-fusion conformation, preventing the pore from resealing.",

The drawing embodies the suggestion that domains I and II have swung outward, while domain III and the stem remain oriented against the membrane roughly as in the pre-fusion state. The fusion loop is now at the top of the diagram and is shown already interacting with the target bilayer. (d) Extended intermediate. Domains I and II have associated into the trimeric core of the post-fusion conformation, but domain III has not yet flipped over (upper arrows) to dock against them47 . To indicate that the stem segment must then zip back along the trimer core (lower arrows), the stem is represented by loops 'poised' to reconfigure. (e) Post-fusion conformation. Domain III has reoriented, and the stem (dashed line, as there is no direct structural information on its conformation or exact position in the postfusion trimer) connects it to the transmembrane anchor, now brought together with the fusion loop in the single, fused bilayer.

This domain contains residues from the N-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain and residues from near the C-terminal part of the chain: we can consider it a framework around which the rest of the molecule reorients. The other two domains form a jointed, two-part fusion machinery. The net effect of their rotations relative to each other and to the core domain is to translate the fusion loops, at the tip of the outermost domain, away from the viral membrane and toward the target membrane.
