He also reported nausea, one episode of vomiting, and watery diarrhea for 3 days. On examination, his temperature was 37.7\u02daC, pulse rate was 87 beats/min, BP was 120/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. Physical examination was notable for moderate respiratory distress and bilateral crackles. The chest radiograph demonstrated a fine nodular interstitial pattern (Fig 1\n). A room air arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.43, Pco\n2 of 36 mm Hg, Po\n2of 41 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 78%. The peripheral WBC count was 9.4 \u00d7 109/L, with 61% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, and 12% monocytes. Treatment with IV erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated. Sputum culture revealed mixed flora. Blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 3, due to the lack of improvement, he underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy of the left lower lobe and lingula. This revealed extensive proliferative (exudative) bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia consistent with BOOP (Fig 2\n). Microbiological staining and cultures of the tissue were negative. The acute serum cold agglutinin titer was 1:512 and the M pneumoniae IgG (complement fixation) was 1:64. The IgM antibody for M pneumoniae was 1:2,560. Convalescence titers for cold agglutinin and IgM were negative. A regimen of IV methylprednisolone was started, 250 mg every 6 h, and the regimen of erythromycin was continued. The patient was discharged from the hospital on hospital day 11 to complete a 3-week course of erythromycin, 500 mg four times daily, and prednisone, 80 mg once daily. Pulmonary function at hospital discharge revealed an FEV1 of 2.03 L (54%), FVC of 2.74 L (59%), FEV1/FVC of 74%, thoracic gas volume of 2.26 L (66%), residual volume of 1.05 L (66%), and total lung capacity of 3.57 L (56%), consistent with severe restrictive lung disease. After 1 month, a chest radiograph revealed only minimal linear scarring at the left lung base. At 5 months, the FEV1 improved to 2.67 L (69%), FVC to 3.52 L (68%), and FEV1/FVC was 76%. Prednisone dosage was tapered over 9 months, guided by improvement in the patient's symptoms and reduction of oxygen requirements.",

This was followed by a nonproductive cough, dyspnea, bilateral pleuritic chest pain, and fevers for 2 days prior to hospital admission. On examination, he was in mild-to-moderate respiratory distress. His temperature was 38.0\u02daC, pulse rate was 120 beats/min, BP was 122/74 mm Hg, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min. There were markedly diminished breath sounds throughout the left lung with scattered bilateral crackles. A room air arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.47, Paco\n2of 31 mm Hg, Pao\n2 of 55 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 88%. The chest radiograph was normal. Treatment with IV ceftriaxone, 1 g every 12 h, and erythromycin, 500 mg every 6 h, was initiated. A ventilation-perfusion lung scan revealed a marked decrease in both ventilation and perfusion on the left (Fig 3\n). On the right, there were several matched ventilation and perfusion defects. A pulmonary arteriogram was normal. Pulmonary function testing revealed FEV1 of 1.87 L (43%), FVC of 2.44 L (44%), FEV1/FVC ratio of 77%, functional residual capacity of 1.85 L (50%), residual volume of 1.64 L (74%), total lung capacity of 4.19 L (54%), and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide corrected for alveolar volume of 6.88 mL/min/mm Hg/L (127%), consistent with a severe restrictive defect. The high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan revealed fine centrilobular nodules throughout the left lung (Fig 4\n). A similar pattern was observed in the superior segment of the right lower lobe consistent with an inflammatory bronchiolitis. Gram's stain, routine bacterial and fungal cultures, and viral cultures of BAL fluid were negative. Sputum cytology and BAL fluid were negative for viral inclusion bodies. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) determination for M pneumoniae from the BAL fluid was positive. PCR amplification was performed at the Diagnostic Virology Laboratory at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and was based on a method previously described.17 The pair of primers used were MP4A (5\u2032-AGG CTC AGG TCA ATC TGG CGT GGA-3\u2032) and MP4B (5\u2032-GGA TCA AAC AGA TCG GTG ACT GGG T-3\u2032), both of which are specific for the M pneumoniae P1 adhesion gene. Once the results of the PCR were known, prednisone, 60 mg/d, was added to the erythromycin regimen, with significant improvement in the patient's symptoms.",

He was a never-smoker. He was treated with cefaclor 1 week prior to hospital admission, without relief. On examination, his temperature was 37.1\u02daC, pulse rate was 106 beats/min, BP was 158/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. On lung examination, there were bilateral crackles and inspiratory squeaks. There was no clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction. Room air arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.39, a Paco\n2 of 36 mm Hg, a Pao\n2 of 44 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 79%. Chest radiograph demonstrated a mild increase in interstitial markings with peribronchial thickening. HRCT of the chest revealed multiple tiny and indistinct nodular opacities with a branching pattern (\u201ctree in bud\u201d) in the periphery, consistent with bronchiolitis (Fig 5\n). In addition, scattered areas of ground-glass opacities were present bilaterally. A ventilation-perfusion lung scan showed multiple ventilatory defects that were either greater than or matched to perfusion defects. A spirometry revealed an FEV1 of 1.17 L (52%), FVC of 1.40 L (36%), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 83%. Sputum culture grew mixed oral flora. The acute cold agglutinin titer was 1:2,048, and a convalescent titer obtained 3 weeks later was 1:16. The level of M pneumoniae IgG fell from 260 to 170 U/mL during the same period. The patient was treated with azithromycin, with progressive improvement of his symptoms.",

Infectious bronchiolitis is an acute, cellular bronchiolitis with epithelial necrosis, inflammation of the bronchiolar walls, and an intraluminal exudate.32\n33 Proliferative bronchiolitis, characteristically seen in the setting of BOOP, consists of polypoid masses of new granulation tissue (Masson's bodies) within the lumina of bronchioles and alveolar ducts, often extending into the alveolar spaces.34 In addition, there is an interstitial cellular response comprised of neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes that can be followed by fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition.33\n35\n36 BOOP is a common nonspecific histologic finding occurring in a variety of unrelated lung diseases, including an idiopathic form.34\n36\n37\n38\n39 Obliterative or constrictive bronchiolitis is recognized by submucosal and peribronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis of the membranous and respiratory bronchioles, leading to concentric bronchiolar luminal narrowing.22 Bronchiolar lesions comprised of both intraluminal granulation tissue and peribronchiolar fibrosis have been described, which suggest that in some cases, constrictive and proliferative bronchiolitis may be expressions of the same disease process.25\n40 Although alveolar wall fibrosis may occur in both proliferative and constrictive bronchiolitis, these entities are clinically and histologically distinct from usual interstitial pneumonitis.41 Constrictive bronchiolitis may demonstrate a variety of radiographic findings, including a normal chest radiograph, hyperinflation, or diffuse nodular opacities. The radiographic pattern in BOOP typically consists of patchy ground-glass opacities, although interstitial and small rounded opacities may be observed.42 Functionally, BOOP and inflammatory bronchiolitis are characterized by a restrictive ventilatory defect with a loss of diffusing surface area. Constrictive bronchiolitis, however, shows progressive obstructive physiologic findings.22\n",

            "text": "The incidence of proven infections that cause bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization in adults is low. Ham43 described seven adults with acute infectious bronchiolitis with obstructive physiologic processes. In one fatal case in which lung tissue was available for examination, findings were more consistent with fatal asthma with evidence of mucus plugging of primary and secondary bronchi, basement membrane thickening, marked eosinophilic infiltration, and Leyden crystal deposition. In another patient, an acute obstructive defect with hyperinflation, a diffuse and fine granular pattern on chest radiograph, and a cold agglutinin titer of 1:1,024 were found, consistent with constrictive bronchiolitis due to either a viral or Mycoplasma infection.43 The patient's dyspnea improved over 3 weeks after inhaled isoproterenol. In the remaining cases, evidence for bronchiolitis was not convincing.43Constrictive bronchiolitis with obstructive physiologic condition was also described in an adult with varicella pneumonia.44O\u2019Reilly45 described an adult with bronchiolitis due to parainfluenza type 2. Despite a normal chest radiograph, there was significant hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Although symptoms and moderate airflow obstruction improved with bronchodilator and corticosteroid treatment, airflow limitation persisted.45 Seggev et al46 reported three cases of bronchiolitis obliterans in which detailed physiologic studies were available. One, a 69-year-old nonsmoking woman, developed a postviral respiratory illness characterized by shortness of breath, airflow limitation, and hypoxemia. Open lung biopsy specimen revealed narrowing of the bronchiolar lumina due to subepithelial deposition of fibrous connective tissue. Although the airway obstruction initially improved with corticosteroid therapy, the patient developed refractory respiratory failure and died. Both the histopathologic condition and the lack of significant improvement with corticosteroids in this patient are consistent with a diagnosis of constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans.",

Goldstein et al49 described BOOP in four patients with nosocomial Serratia marcescens pneumonia. However, in all cases, the BOOP reaction was not the predominant feature but rather accompanied a necrotizing bronchopneumonia. Sato et al31described a case of bronchiolitis resulting from L pneumophila, diagnosed by a fourfold rise in indirect fluorescent antibody titer. The patient presented with radiographic bilateral diffuse infiltrates and severe hypoxemia that dramatically responded to corticosteroids. Based on the pathologic description of the polypoid masses of intraluminal connective tissue and the favorable response to corticosteroids, this lesion should be classified as BOOP. Miyagawa et al50 described two elderly patients with postinfectious BOOP. One had serologic evidence of L pneumophila infection and the other, M pneumoniae infection. Interestingly, circulating immune complexes were found in both patients prior to treatment with corticosteroids and were undetectable after treatment. A 57-year-old woman was recently reported to have BOOP due to M pneumoniae infection.51 Similar to our patient 1 with BOOP, there was significant improvement with corticosteroid treatment. In a patient with IgA deficiency due to ataxia-telangiectasia, BOOP occurred due to M pneumoniae infection.52\n",

In three of the cases, there was an accompanying bronchopneumonia. A lymphoplasmocytic bronchiolar wall infiltrate with a neutrophil-rich intraluminal exudate was present. Ultrastructurally, there was extensive injury to the respiratory mucosa, causing loss of cilia and ciliated cells. Also noted was edema, fibrosis, and plasma cells infiltrating the bronchial and bronchiolar walls with extension of the inflammatory exudate from the bronchiolar lumen into the alveolar spaces. This histologic pattern is distinct from both constrictive bronchiolitis and BOOP. Although most patients with acute infectious inflammatory bronchiolitis recover without significant sequelae, some may develop constrictive bronchiolitis or reactive airways disease.33\n53 Based on this and the few reports of constrictive bronchiolitis evolving from BOOP, we speculate that acute inflammatory bronchiolitis could also be an earlier stage of proliferative bronchiolitis (BOOP). Fraley et al12described a patient with respiratory failure from M pneumoniae pneumonia who had both acute necrotizing pneumonitis with consolidation and \u201cbronchiolitis obliterans\u201d on open lung biopsy specimen. Although the type of bronchiolitis was not described further,12 the restrictive changes noted on pulmonary function tests would argue against constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans and would be more representative of BOOP or inflammatory bronchiolitis. In another patient with respiratory failure due to M pneumoniae, a nodular infiltrate on chest radiograph correlated with a lung biopsy specimen that showed a confluent infiltrate in a bronchiolocentric distribution.13 The inflammatory infiltrate consisted of plasma cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in addition to basophilic connective tissue obliterating the lumen of the small airways and alveolar ducts. Pulmonary function testing in this patient revealed a mixed obstructive and restrictive defect.",

            "text": "Herein we describe three adults with M pneumoniae pulmonary infections who presented with small airways disease as their only manifestation. One (patient 1) had postinfectious bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and two had an acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. Although patient 1 had BOOP, his chest radiograph was atypical. Patients 1 and 3 had subtle findings on chest radiograph despite severe gas exchange abnormalities, and patient 2 had striking ventilatory and perfusion defects despite a normal chest radiograph. These cases are unusual because both BOOP and inflammatory bronchiolitis are uncommon presentations of M pneumoniaeinfections, especially in the absence of lobar or patchy alveolar pneumonia. Moreover, acute infectious bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization is unusual in adults. In patient 1, open lung biopsy specimen demonstrated a proliferative bronchiolitis. The restrictive physiology, crackles on lung examination, and response to corticosteroids in this individual are consistent with the diagnosis of BOOP.34 Although it is possible that constrictive bronchiolitis may follow BOOP, this patient, after 2 years of follow-up, has not developed progressive airflow limitation. One notable finding in patient 2 was the marked asymmetric and extensive involvement by bronchiolitis of the left lung, as evinced by physical examination, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning, and HRCT. The bronchiolitis present in patients 2 and 3 is not consistent with either constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans because of the lack of obstructive physiology or of BOOP based on the HRCT scan, but it rather is characteristic of an inflammatory (cellular) bronchiolitis.56 The HRCT findings are similar to other inflammatory bronchiolar diseases such as diffuse panbronchiolitis.32 In two of the patients in whom full pulmonary physiologic testing was done, severe restrictive lung disease was present in both patients. Although restrictive physiologic condition is to be expected in the patient with BOOP,18 we postulate that the matched ventilatory and perfusion defects that were present in the left lung of the second patient with inflammatory bronchiolitis indicated a poorly functioning left lung, resulting in low lung volumes. The third patient did not have lung volumes measured, but the FEV1 to FVC ratio of > 100% predicted suggests a restrictive pattern.",
