Humanitarian settings present complex challenges in delivering healthcare.3 Despite international commitments to upholding health as a human right for all, humanitarian crises-affected populations are often neglected in emergency disease control strategies. The threat that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to humanitarian settings is significant and requires urgent attention. We highlight areas of particular concern and call on international and local partners, national governments and donors to ensure that humanitarian settings are not left behind in efforts to collectively manage the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide.",

Any loss to the health workforce will add pressure to an already under-resourced service, with implications for patient care and ability to control COVID-19.

We anticipate that in countries with a high number of refugees, host populations may be prioritised by governments in their strategies to tackle COVID-19. This is a concern from an equity and human rights perspective, as well as continuing risk of transmission among the population as a whole if refugee populations are not fully integrated into the COVID-19 strategy. Within humanitarian settings, outbreak surveillance mechanisms are often weak due to limited laboratory capacity, lack of beds in intensive care units, lack of ventilators and lack of infrastructure in good condition.8 The expertise of humanitarian organisations already present can be integral to setting up health facilities to triage and manage COVID-19 patients; however, this should not distract from ensuring governments and partners implementing sustainable strategies to manage outbreaks.",

Interventions endorsed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as social distancing will prove extremely challenging to implement. Measures to reduce overcrowding must be prioritised, including upgrading shelter to achieve minimum shelter standards of personal covered living space.7 If upgrading shelter is not possible, then one of the following three options recommended by Dahab et al, should be implemented based on the type of humanitarian setting: (i) household-level shielding, (ii) street-level or extended family-level shielding or (iii) neighbourhood-level or sector-level isolation.13\n",
