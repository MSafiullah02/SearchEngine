The number of cases and case-fatality rate in Italian adults with COVID-19 are higher compared with many other countries [5]. This may be because of an older mean population age, higher frequency of comorbidities in the older population, and the limited number of rhino-pharyngeal swabs performed on asymptomatic people during the initial phase of the Italian epidemic. In this scenario, data from our paediatric multicentre study confirm the different course of the infection in the paediatric age group: children were a marginal percentage of the Italian infected population admitted to hospital and tended to develop benign, pauci-symptomatic disease.",

            "text": "The contribution of children to disease transmission is still under debate, including whether they might serve as facilitators of viral transmission, being a silent reservoir for the virus. Many hypotheses have been formulated on the mechanisms underlying children\u2019s lower susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults; these include an immature receptor system, specific regulatory mechanisms in the immune respiratory system and cross-protection by antibodies directed towards common viral infections in infancy [6]. However, nearly 40% of the children included in this report were under 1 year of age and the majority of them were hospitalised, suggesting a higher susceptibility to symptomatic COVID-19 in this specific age group: the two children who required ICU admission were a neonate and a 2-month-old infant. However, the high number of children under 1 year of age in our study may also reflect both a higher tendency for families to seek medical advice for younger children and a higher propensity among clinicians to admit them to hospitals. Also in the United States (US), hospitalisation was more common among children under 1 year of age than in other paediatric age groups, including ICU admission [1]. According to the Italian national public health institute\u2019s surveillance report of 10 April, SARS-CoV-2 infection affected a total of 1,936 children, of whom 5.2% were hospitalised; the percentage of hospitalised children within the 0 to 1-year-old age group was 10.9%. A rough estimate of the general hospitalisation rate in the Italian paediatric population is 39.6 per 1,000 children [7].",

First, our population includes children and adolescents under 18 years of age: this make some results difficult to compare with other publications that consider children and adolescents up to 15 or 16 years. Secondly, the limited sample size for some analyses does not allow to draw definite conclusions. For example, because of small numbers and differences in demographic conditions between children who did vs did not receive antiviral treatments, clinical progression of treated and untreated children could not be compared. Also, with a wider population, specific comparison and analysis in different age groups should be looked specifically at.",
