In addition, networks underlying infection events are often much more complex than described by meanfield equations or regular lattices. In models with simple transition rules such as the SIS and SIR models, heterogeneous contact rates are known to decrease epidemic thresholds. We analyze steady states of various multi-state disease propagation models with heterogeneous contact rates. In many models, heterogeneity simply decreases epidemic thresholds. However, in models with competing pathogens and mutation, coexistence of different pathogens for small infection rates requires network-independent conditions in addition to heterogeneity in contact rates. Furthermore, models without spontaneous neighbor-independent state transitions, such as cyclically competing species, do not show heterogeneity effects.",

We concentrate on endemic models in which the phase boundary between the coexistence state, where both susceptible and infected individuals can survive, and the disease-free state with the susceptible individuals only is concerned. Of course, we then disregard the other important class of epidemic models including the SIR model, in which possibility of one-shot waves of outbreaks rather than coexistence is concerned (for this distinction, see [5, 16] ). Instead of covering both classes, we investigate phase boundaries of endemic models with more than two states and possibly with more than two phases. We show that the critical infection rates are largely extinct as k 2 \u2192 \u221e. However, there are a couple of important exceptions to this rule: models with mutation or cyclic interaction. In Sec. II, we start with studying two models that follow the k / k 2 -scaling. Sections III, IV, V, and VI are devoted to the analysis of representative models with different characteristics and outcomes. Some of them do not follow the k / k 2 -scaling.

In other words, a birth event occurs at a vacant site at a rate proportional to \u03bb and the number of neighboring adults. Youngs (state 1) spend random time of mean r before becoming adult (state 2). They are also subject to random death events at a rate of \u03b4. Adults die at a rate of 1, which gives normalization of the entire model. Alternatively, we can interpret the three states as 0: vacant, 1: partially occupied, and 2: fully occupied colonies. Then, only fully occupied colonies are potent enough to colonize vacant lands. In the disease analogue, 0 is susceptible, 1 is infected but in the incubation period (not infectious), and 2 is infected and infectious.

The heterogeneity in contact rates equally boosts the infection strengths of competing pathogens in these models. Whether multiple strains survive or one overwhelms the others depends on network-independent mutation rates that modulate relative strengths of pathogens. The rock-scissors-paper game and the voter model stipulate another class of models in which heterogeneity does not affect the equilibrium population density at all. For the heterogeneity to take effects, there must be at least one neighbor-independent transition rate.",

However, we consider that what essentially matters is gross arrangements of contagion pathways. If there is at least one transmission route independent of the neighbors' states, which is not the case for the rocksrissors-paper game, the equilibrium population density will depend on degree distributions as does the contact process. A care must be paid to cases of competing pathogens with mutation. We hope that our results give prescription for understanding complex-network consequences of other models.",

In addition, the stability of coexistence solutions of the rock-scissors-paper game shows network dependence [28] . These topics are warranted for future work. ",
