While parenchymal lesions exhibit a more insidious and non-specific presentation, endotracheal and endobronchial lesions often present with unilateral wheeze due to obstruction and can be easily misdiagnosed as asthma [7]. Despite the rarity and non-specific clinical presentation of most lung tumours, malignant disease should be considered in children with constitutional symptoms and persistent wheeze, haemoptysis, atelectasis or pneumonia who fail to respond to therapy [5].",

Aggregates of rigid blasts cause plugging of the microvasculature and associated oxygen defects, potentiating pulmonary endothelial injury, haemorrhage and tissue hypoxia [8, 13, 14]. As such, the risk of respiratory complications increases with the degree of leukocytosis [15]. However, not all children with high leukocyte counts, such as those with chronic leukaemias, develop this complication due to the morphology and maturity of the leukocytes. Children with AML are at greatest risk of pulmonary leukostasis and tend to develop respiratory distress at lower leukocyte counts than those with ALL [9, 12]. This is because myeloblasts are larger and release pro-inflammatory cytokines with specific adhesion molecules that facilitate aggressive invasion of pulmonary endothelium [12, 16]. \n",

Computed tomography (CT) radiography may demonstrate thickening of the bronchovascular bundles, prominence of peripheral pulmonary arteries and ground-glass opacities due to leukaemic cell infiltration [1, 17, 18].

While bronchoalveolar lavage is a valuable diagnostic tool, it may be of less value if patients have already commenced empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobials [46]. CT-guided fine-needle biopsy can also play a role; however, the gold standard remains thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy [47].

Subsequent vascular permeability results in interstitial oedema and the formation of hyaline membranes as plasma proteins and fluid enters alveoli [2]. Cytokines (primarily TNF-\u03b1, IL-1B and TGF-B) further potentiate endothelial damage and type 1 pneumocyte apoptosis [61, 74, 75]. Finally, inflammatory cell influx and immune processes lead to fibrosis of the lung parenchyma and bronchi [2].

Reduced DLCO is considered the most sensitive marker of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, where therapy cessation is indicated if <60% of baseline [2, 62]. However, it is important to note that DLCO abnormalities may only become apparent 6 months post-therapy. CT radiography can be a useful adjunct for monitoring disease progression and typically demonstrates fine nodular infiltrates with a bibasilar reticular pattern [55]. While bleomycin injury is generally associated with restrictive defects and impaired diffusion, a recent study in children treated with contemporary, lower-dose bleomycin\nregimens found hyperinflation and obstructive lung disease to be most common up to 12 years post-diagnosis [2, 65, 66]. It has been hypothesised that these abnormalities could be due to airway inflammation from bleomycin-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines or a bridging process of early fibrosis.",

While the etiopathogenesis is difficult to determine, thromboembolic events may be associated with increased thrombin generation with malignancy, tumour emboli from cell lysis, altered haemostasis due to L-asparaginase use, acquired thrombophilia in the early post-transplant period, thrombogenic intravenous hyperalimentation and/or endothelial injury with central line use [98\u2013100]. In children with acute respiratory failure associated with PE, studies suggest prompt thrombolytic therapy is effective for reducing early morbidity [95]. However, asymptomatic and undetected PEs do not appear to adversely affect patient outcomes [97]. \n",

Children are at risk of impaired alveoli development, which can lead to respiratory insufficiency [102, 103]. Abnormal growth of musculoskeletal structures can also decrease chest wall compliance and further restrict pulmonary function [58]. Other respiratory morbidities can be associated with cardiopulmonary compromise, limited exercise tolerance and infections due to delayed immune reconstitution. Notably, studies have found the cumulative incidence of pulmonary morbidities increases with time since diagnosis [59]. This suggests that early childhood injury may cause late-onset respiratory complications and potentially accelerate physiological lung function decline. \n",

Though opportunistic infections rarely occur late post-BMT, cases are reported which suggests that transplantation itself (in the absence of GVHD or immunosuppression) can cause long-term immune dysfunction [115]. One of the factors influencing this is that for restoration of humoral immune function, post-BMT rebuilding of stores of na\u00efve B cells and memory B cells is necessary. Hence all BMT patients are at risk of opportunistic infections from encapsulated bacteria and viruses for up to 1 year post-BMT [115].",

DAH begins in the pre-engraftment period (most commonly in the second or third week) [113], and a higher rate of DAH is seen in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) [118]. Typical clinical features are increasing dyspnoea, dry cough, and hypoxaemia [113]. Fevers may or may not occur. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) reveals increasingly blood-stained fluid; however, haemoptysis is not typically seen [114]. PERDS develops in the first 5 days post-engraftment during neutrophil recovery [114] [121]. Classically patients present with fever, rash and hypoxaemia and dyspnoea due to non-cardiac pulmonary oedema [121]. PERDS has been observed in non-myeloablative regimens that avoid conditioning-associated toxicities. This would suggest that white cell recovery itself and the associated release of soluble factors are implicated in the aetiology of PERDS [121].",

Lung biopsy is not often performed in BMT patients, and therefore the extent of GVHD and level of pulmonary tissue damage are not as clearly understood as that of other organ systems [122]. Historically the lungs were not believed to be a typical target for acute GVHD; however, data now reveals that this is the case for a subgroup of patients [122]. Recent National Institute of Health (NIH) working groups have sought to better define lung chronic GVHD [123, 124]. Previously, the only diagnostic pulmonary manifestation of cGVHD was biopsy-proven constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans (CBO); however, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a clinical entity, is now included in the NIH diagnostic criteria for lung cGVHD [123].",

Risk factors for development in post-BMT populations include chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), pre-transplant conditioning (e.g., busulfan), early viral infections and advanced age of recipient [112]. Treatment involves immunosuppression using oral and inhaled corticosteroids. Other medications which may have a role include azithromycin used for its anti-inflammatory properties and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab [112]. A wide range of non-steroidal immunosuppressive agents have also been used including azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, imatinib, and etanercept [127].

While the clinical BOS classification includes CBO, BOS also encompasses other pathological entities such as lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB) [124, 128]. In LB, lymphocytic inflammation occurs around and infiltrates the peripheral airways; however, there is no sub-epithelial fibrosis. It has been proposed that LB may be an earlier stage in the development of CBO from several differing underlying disorders including infection [129]. CBO and LB patients present with similar clinical symptoms and have similar pulmonary function; however, those with LB respond better to treatment [128].

It is most commonly reported in allogeneic transplant recipients, and risk factors are HLA mismatch, T-cell-depleted grafts and EBV-seronegative recipients matched with EBV-seropositive donors [131]. Conditioning protocols that result in T-cell depletion and in turn cause uninhibited EBV-driven B-cell production are implicated in PTLD. PTLD can be classified into four pathogenic categories:Early lesions including reactive plasmacytic hyperplasia (PH) and infectious mononucleosis (IM)-like PTLDPolymorphic lesions which show disruption of nodal architecture or a destructive extra-nodal massMonomorphic PTLD which can be divided into B-cell or T-cell neoplasmsHodgkin lymphoma (HL) which is an unusual form of PTLD with histology similar to classic HL [132]\n",
