The anti-inflammatory influence of near-daily physical activity in lowering C-reactive protein, total blood leukocytes, interleukin-6, and other inflammatory cytokines may play a key role in lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, sarcopenia, and dementia. Moderate exercise training causes favorable perturbations in immunity and a reduction in incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). During each bout of moderate exercise, an enhanced recirculation of immunoglobulins, neutrophils, and natural killer cells occurs that persists for up to 3-h post-exercise. This exercise-induced surge in immune cells from the innate immune system is transient but improves overall surveillance against pathogens. As moderate exercise continues on a near-daily basis for 12e15 weeks, the number of symptoms days with URTI is decreased 25%e50% compared to randomized sedentary controls. Epidemiologic and animal studies support this inverse relationship between URTI risk and increased physical activity.",

During prolonged and intense exercise, IL-6 is produced by muscle fibers and stimulates the appearance in the circulation of other anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ra and IL-10. 26 IL-6 also inhibits the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a and stimulates lipolysis and fat oxidation. 26 With weight loss from energy restriction and exercise, plasma levels of IL-6 fall, skeletal muscle TNF-a decreases, and insulin sensitivity improves. 27, 28 Thus IL-6 release from the exercising muscle may help mediate some of the health benefits of exercise including metabolic control of type 2 diabetes. 27, 28 Fig. 1. C-reactive protein (CRP) adjusted means for frequency of physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and several other lifestyle and demographic factors. 15 Clinical implications of exercise immunology Muscle IL-6 release, however, is very low during moderate physical activity. For example, during a 30-min brisk walk on a treadmill, plasma IL-6 concentrations increased from1.3 pg/mL to 2.0 pg/mL in female subjects. 29 The increase in IL-6 during brisk walking is probably insufficient to mediate anti-inflammatory and other beneficial health effects, and additional research is needed to determine the relative contribution of myokines compared to other exercise-induced factors. The acute exerciseinduced increase in IL-6 after heavy exertion (e.g., typically above 5 pg/mL, 10 pg/mL, and 50 pg/mL following 1-h, 2-h, and marathon race running bouts, respectively) may indeed orchestrate anti-inflammatory influences, lipolysis, and improved insulin sensitivity, but this amount of physical activity is beyond levels achievable by most overweight/obese individuals.",

            "text": "URTI is the most frequently occurring infectious disease in humans worldwide. 31e33 More than 200 different viruses cause the common cold, and rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are the culprits 25%e60% of the time. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases reports that people in the USA suffer one billion colds each year with an incidence of 2e4 for the average adult and 6e10 for children. 31 URTI imposes an estimated USD40 billion burden in direct and indirect costs on the U.S. economy. 32 Low to high exercise workloads have a unique effect on URTI risk. 34 Regular physical activity improves immune function and lowers URTI risk while sustained and intense exertion has the opposite effect. Marathon race competitions and heavy exercise training regimens increase URTI risk, but relatively few individuals exercise at this level, limiting public health concerns. The second half of this chapter will review the benefits of regular, moderate activity in improving immunosurveillance against pathogens and lowering URTI risk. This information has broad public health significance and appeal, and provides the clinician with an additional inducement to encourage increased physical activity among patients.",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence support the linkage between moderate physical activity and improved immunity and lowered infection rates: survey, animal, epidemiologic, and randomized training data. Survey data consistently support the common belief among fitness enthusiasts that regular exercise confers resistance against infection. In surveys, 80%e90% of regular exercisers perceive themselves as less vulnerable to viral illnesses compared to sedentary peers. 35, 36 Animal studies are difficult to apply to the human condition, but in general, support the finding that moderate exercise lowers morbidity and mortality following pathogen inoculation, especially when compared to prolonged and intense exertion or physical inactivity. Mice infected with the herpes simplex virus, for example, and then exposed to 30-min of moderate exercise experience a lower mortality during a 21day period compared to higher mortality rates after 2.5 h of exhaustive exercise or rest. 37 Another study with mice showed that 3.5 months of moderate exercise training compared to no exercise prior to induced influenza infection decreased symptom severity and lung viral loads and inflammation. 38 Retrospective and prospective epidemiologic studies have measured URTI incidence in large groups of moderately active and sedentary individuals. Collectively, the epidemiologic studies consistently show reduced URTI rates in physically active or fit individuals. A one-year epidemiological study of 547 adults showed a 23% reduction in URTI risk in those engaging in regular versus irregular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. 39 In a group of 145 elderly subjects, URTI symptomatology during a one-year period was reduced among those engaging in higher compared to lower amounts of moderate physical activity. 40 During a one-year study of 142 males aged 33e90 years, the odds of having at least 15 days with URTI was 64% lower among those with higher physical activity patterns. 41 A cohort of 1509 Swedish men and women aged 20e60 years were followed for 15 weeks during the winter/spring. 42 Subjects in the upper tertile for physical activity experienced an 18% reduction in URTI risk, but this proportion improved to 42% among those with high perceived mental stress.",

In a randomized, controlled study of 36 women (mean age, 35 years), subjects walked briskly for 45-min, five days a week, and experienced one-half the days with URTI symptoms (5.1 vs. 10.8) during the 15- week period compared to that of the sedentary control group. 46 The effect of exercise training (five 45-min walking sessions/ week at 60%e75% maximum heart rate) and/or moderate energy restriction (1200e1300 kcal per day) on URTI was studied in obese women (n \u00bc 91, BMI 33.1 AE 0.6 kg/m 2 ) randomized to one of four groups: control, exercise, diet, exercise and diet. 47 Energy restriction had no significant effect on URTI incidence, and subjects from the two exercise groups were contrasted with subjects from the two nonexercise groups.

Animal data indicate that lung macrophages play an important role in mediating the beneficial effects of moderate exercise on lowered susceptibility to infection. 54 Stress hormones, which can suppress immunity, and pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines, indicative of intense metabolic activity, are not elevated during moderate exercise. 29 Although the immune system returns to pre-exercise levels within a few hours after the exercise session is over, each session may represent an improvement in immune surveillance that reduces the risk of infection over the long term. Other exerciseimmune related benefits include enhanced antibody-specific responses to vaccinations. For example, several studies indicate that both acute and chronic moderate exercise training improves the body's antibody response to the influenza vaccine. 55e58 In one study, a 45-min moderate exercise bout just before influenza vaccination improved the antibody response. 55 These data provide additional evidence that moderate exercise favorably influences overall immune surveillance against pathogens.
