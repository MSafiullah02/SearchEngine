Neonatal myasthenia gravis associated with MuSK antibodies is often a severe and protracted albeit transient disease (B\u00e9hin et al. 2008; Evoli 2010) . Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis (MG) is a human model of passively transferring the disease. Although all newborn babies of myasthenic mothers have anti-AChR antibodies at birth (Morel et al. 1988; Tzartos et al. 1990) , only a small percentage of them (10-15%) express the myasthenic syndrome (Namba et al. 1970) . The myasthenic symptoms usually appear a few hours after birth and their average duration is about 3 weeks. Neonatal myasthenia gravis is transiently transferred from the mothers to the newborn. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies result in loss of AChRs and also directly block the function of the remaining AChR molecules, thereby causing a defect in neuromuscular transmission. The majority, though not all, of both myasthenic and non-myasthenic infants were found to have a repertoire of anti-AChR specificities very similar to their mothers. No significant differences were observed between sera from the two groups of mothers. Adequate treatment in mothers can reduce both frequency and severity of neonatal disease. Neonatal disease will recover following IVIg treatment (B\u00e9hin et al. 2008; O'Carroll et al. 2009 ).

The human fetal acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is present until 33 weeks gestation, when the fetal (g) subunit is replaced by the adult (e) subunit.
