A novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) was identified as the cause of the infections and has since spread worldwide. As of May 7, 2020, more than 3.6 million cases of COVID-19 (illness caused by SARS-COV-2) have been reported in 184 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f countries and territories, including ~250,000 deaths (Dong et al., 2020 , World Health Organization, 2020 . The pandemic has overwhelmed both national and local healthcare capacity in several countries (Ferguson et al., 2020 , Kissler et al., 2020 , and is projected to do so in many others. Low-and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable (Walker et al., 2020) , since financial and logistical challenges may hinder their ability to augment treatment capacity. As such, many countries have resorted to societal-wide social distancing interventions in the hopes of reducing morbidity and delaying the demand for healthcare resources, in order to gain time to increase treatment capacity.",

While informative, these efforts have been limited to specific nations and snapshots in time and public health officials are reliant on the authors for updated estimates as the pandemic evolves. Other internet-based tools offer public health users the ability to generate estimates on their own, but these are limited in their practical utility because their assumptions and desired results may not match the specific needs of jurisdictions and public health decision makers, or they require coding knowledge to access or modify the calculations (Healthcare, 2020 , Henderson, 2020 . These considerations are more critical in low and middle-income countries, which may not have the resources to complete or modify such analyses on their own. Therefore, we developed a modeling tool for use by practicing public health officials to estimate the future impact of the CoVID-19 outbreak on the demand for healthcare resources in their jurisdictions and for examining the costs and benefits of various intervention strategies. Once downloaded, the model can be used without an internet connection, to assist public health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f officials with choosing locally applicable intervention strategies and by how much to increasing hospital treatment capacity. For illustration, we apply the model to Chile, a Southern Hemisphere country where the virus is generating local transmission, and compare various interventions options in the three most affected regions of the country.",

We also assume transmission chains generated by infected travelers entering the population are minimal compared to existing transmission in the community. As a result, the number of new infections each day is the product of the proportion of the population that is susceptible, the number of infectious persons on a given day, and the average number of new infections each infected person causes over the span of their illness (the reproduction number; hereafter, \"R\") divided by the duration (in days) of the average infectious period. Infectiousness is assumed to occur five days after infection (Lauer et al., 2020) and lasts 11 days (You et al., 2020) . Upon recovery from infection, individuals are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f assumed immune to re-infection during the timespan modeled (through December 2020). In the absence of intervention R is 2.0 (low estimate) and 2.8 (high estimate), approximately spanning the middle 50% of the gamma distribution of R (95% intervals: 1.4-3.8) estimated from the early growth-rate of the epidemic in Wuhan (Li et al., 2020, Riou and .

Our projections also suggest that with immediate aggressive action to implement several combinations of interventions the current amount of hospital beds and critical care beds may be sufficient. In specific circumstances, regional authorities may find it easier to augment their current capacity (e.g. ventilators in \u00d1uble) along with some mitigation strategies to meet demand versus strictly burdening society with disruptive mitigations. Policymakers should be aware, however, that our results indicate that more effective intervention strategies at temporarily suppressing transmission can also result in larger epidemics upon lifting the strategy than less effective, longer-lasting strategies (in the absence of vaccine and changes in individual behavior). As such, it may be necessary to keep societal-wide interventions in place, or intermittently start and stop them again based on active monitoring of cases counts and treatment capacity, until a vaccine or treatment that can be administered outside of the hospital setting are available.",

            "text": "While our projections are reasonable estimates for how the pandemic may play out given our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2, they should not be considered as forecasts of what will occur. This is due to the uncertainty in our understanding of an outbreak that is still unfolding, the application of experiences of other countries to Chile (such as case severity, resource use by non-COVID patients, intervention effectiveness, compliance over time), simplifying assumptions (such as homogenous mixing), and case surveillance uncertainty. We assumed homogenous mixing to make implementing our model in a spreadsheet more tractable, but as a result, do not reflect potential important variabilities in contact patterns stemming from population social and spatial structures or behavior differences that can affect disease dynamics. Since obtaining accurate data regarding contact patterns during an ongoing outbreak is challenging and because these patterns may evolve with the outbreak we chose to focus on producing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the simplest useful model. To address case surveillance uncertainty, users can scale upwards or downwards their case count inputs occurring over the prior two weeks based on perceived underreporting or overreporting and examine the influence on outputs (as we did in our illustrative scenario). Similarly, all assumptions and sources are explicitly presented in the tool, and all can be readily modified by the user to reflect their interests and as new information comes to light. Therefore, users should consider the value of this tool as its ability to support the evaluation of relative differences in results associated with \"what-if\" scenarios. COVID Surge has other limitations worth noting. Our estimates of beds and ventilators needed and the number of deaths averted also depends on associated resources not modeled here. Such resources include trained staff (respiratory therapists, nurses, and physicians) for the successful clinical management of hospitalized and ventilated patients and ancillary supplies associated with a bed or ventilator (e.g. electric circuits, oxygen, etc.). Furthermore, these resources may be impacted by the pandemic itself: staff absenteeism due to illnesses (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) and supply-chain disruptions in personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel may further exacerbate the situation. The effects of seasonality on the transmission dynamics of COVID19 remains unclear, but the transmission of similar respiratory illnesses (e.g., influenza, syncytial virus) peaks in the wintertime Viboud, 2009, Shaman and Kohn, 2009 ). If COVID19 exhibits similar seasonality, or patients with these other illnesses place additional demands on the healthcare system, there may be even fewer resources available to treat COVID19 patients at the epidemic's peak. Finally, we do not differentiate between specialized pediatric and non-pediatric resources. While this is justifiable because the current pandemic does not appear to pose a great enough risk to children to overwhelm pediatric healthcare capacity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f , Verity et al., 2020 , users of the tool should take note of this meaningful difference when inputting resource amounts.",
