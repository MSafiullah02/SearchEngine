One challenging aspect of the course is to introduce students to epidemiology, which considers the causes, dispersal, and control of disease. Although disease transmission models have helped develop successful strategies for managing epidemics, most science students are unaware of their advantages and complexities. To address this challenge, the microbiology course at Wofford College has incorporated a sequence of three or four laboratories on modeling the spread of disease. Emphasis in Computational Science students who have studied modeling and simulation in depth serve as laboratory assistants and mentors. Evidence from test scores and self-assessment support the hypothesis that the sequence of laboratories has improved student understanding of human disease dynamics and demonstrated the utility of computational models.",

As another example, using data and mathematical models, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports developed \"a national plan to minimize effects of pandemic influenza\" [2] . Recognizing the benefits of modeling the spread of disease, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the National Institutes of Health, has a collaborative effort, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS), to develop computational models for use by \"policymakers, public health workers, and other researchers who want to better understand and respond to emerging infectious diseases\" [3] .",

Even students who have not had calculus or who have not taken mathematics in several years quickly grasp the concept and derivative notation. In the tutorial, they learn that in unconstrained growth, such as for the prey in an environment of unlimited resources and no predator, the rate of change of prey is proportional to the number of prey, or d(prey_population)/dt = growth_rate * prey_population, where growth_rate is a constant. Figure 1 shows a model diagram of the prey in such a circumstance. Using systems dynamics software, the user double-clicks each component and enters the initial prey population, constant of proportionality, and differential equation for growth, namely growth_rate * prey_population, in the flow into prey_population.

However, this prey's population is reduced by an amount proportional to the product of the number of predators and the prey, prey_death_proportionality_constant * predator_population * prey_population. One interpretation considers the product predator_population * prey_population, which is maximum number of distinct interactions between predators and prey. The decrease in the number of prey is proportional to this product, where the constant of proportionality is related to the hunting ability of the predators and the survival ability of the prey. A second interpretation is that the size of the prey population decreases in proportion to the size of the predator population.",

With the analogy of unconstrained growth/decay for prey births and predator deaths, students quickly understand the rate recover to be proportional to infecteds, so that recovery_rate * infecteds is the formula in the recover flow. Moreover, just as interactions hurt prey and help predators, interactions between susceptibles and infecteds result in illness. Thus, the flow from susceptibles to infecteds gets the formula infection_constant * susceptibles * infecteds. Figure 5 presents a typical graph of the number of susceptibles, infecteds, and recovereds for the SIR model.
