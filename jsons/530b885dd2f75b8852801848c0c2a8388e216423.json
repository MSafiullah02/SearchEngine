The concomitant increase in antibiotic use along with the ease with which organisms develop mechanisms of resistance have together become a medical crisis, underscoring the importance of developing innovative and effective antimicrobial strategies. Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenously produced molecule with many physiologic functions, including broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and immunomodulatory properties. The risk of resistance to NO is minimized because NO has multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial action. NO's clinical utility has been limited largely because it is highly reactive and lacks appropriate vehicles for storage and delivery. To harness NO's antimicrobial potential, a variety exogenous NO delivery platforms have been developed and evaluated, yet limitations preclude their use in the clinical setting. Nanotechnology represents a paradigm through which these limitations can be overcome, allowing for the encapsulation, controlled release, and focused delivery of NO for the treatment of SSTI.",

            "text": "T he incidence of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) due to multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens is continuing to rise. 1 As a result, antibiotic use has increased in parallel to this trend. For example, a population-based study in Canada demonstrated a 15% increase in physician visits for SSTI and an associated 49% increase in antibiotic prescriptions between 1996 and 2008. 2 Unfortunately, increasing antibiotic use has become a major driving force in the development of resistant organisms, undermining their very purpose. 3 Staphylococcus aureus is the etiologic agent and endemic cause of the majority of SSTI in the United States. 4, 5 The growing rate of methicillin-resistant Resistance can also occur via de novo mutations or by the acquisition of resistance genes via horizontal transfer between microbes. 1, 7 Some resistance mechanisms include direct removal of the drug from the intracellular space, decreased diffusion of the drug via modification or loss of porins, alterations or upregulation of drug target sites, bacterial enzyme drug degradation. 8 Because excessive antibiotic use is associated with the emergence of and selection for resistance, 3 antibiotic overuse and misuse also contributes to the growing problem of bacterial resistance. 1, 4, 9 Nitric oxide (NO) is a diatomic gaseous molecule endogenously produced which, among other properties, exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Antibiotic agents that exert multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial action limit pathogens' ability to develop resistance; such drugs are advantageous for this reason. The risk of bacterial resistance to both innate production and exogenous delivery of NO is minimized because NO exhibits multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial action. 8 However, NO's utility in the clinical setting has been restricted because it is highly reactive and lacks proper vehicles for its delivery and storage, [10] [11] [12] A variety of exogenous NO sources have been developed and studied for antimicrobial efficacy, but limitations preclude their use in the clinical setting. Nanotechnology offers a platform for targeted drug delivery, and extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of antibacterial nanoparticles (nps). NO's broad antimicrobial properties and successful incorporation into nps offers a promising solution to the treatment of SSTI.",

When activated, both of these enzymes produce low quantities of NO for short time periods. 15 In these small quantities, NO functions as a signaling molecule. 22 NOS2 or inducible NOS (iNOS) was originally discovered in macrophages 4, 24 but is now known to be expressed in many cell types. 23, 24 iNOS generates large quantities of NO in a noncalcium-dependent fashion, and is induced by a wide array of stimulants including proinflammatory cytokines, 13, 20, 21, [23] [24] [25] bacterial polysaccharides and endotoxins, 13, 21, 23, 25 and neuropeptides 23 (Figure 1 ), which often act synergistically in iNOS activation. 15",

            "text": "NO plays a variety of important physiologic roles including blood pressure regulation, neurotransmission, inhibition of platelet aggregation, immune response, and wound healing. 12, 26, 27 Because of its short half-life, measured on the order of seconds, NO's biological impact is determined primarily by its rate of formation. 14, 16 Its site of action is often close to its site of generation, as NO is rapidly scavenged by hemoglobin and myoglobin. 13, 16 NO initiates multiple cellular signaling cascades, most notably via the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) pathway. In this paradigm, NO binds to sGC, causing increased cyclic GMP levels and activation of protein kinase G. This signaling cascade leads to many downstream effects that facilitate both NO's local biologic activity as a vasodilator and neurotransmitter, as well as its distant impacts as an anti-pyretic. 23 NO can interact with many molecular targets, including protein thiols, heme, nonheme iron, tyrosyl radical proteins, deoxynucleotides, and deoxynucleosides. 14 It can react with glutathione (GSH) and other thiol-containing molecules to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs), which function as NO carriers and donors. 28 As a free radical, NO can generate potent nitrosylating agents capable of both signaling and cellular damage, such as peroxynitrite (OONO \u2212 ) in the presence of superoxide. 23 This effect only occurs at higher concentrations, since as mentioned above, NO is rapidly scavenged in most physiological conditions. RSNOs, S-nitrosylated proteins, nitrosyl-metal complexes, and nitrite may assist in long distance transport of NO. However, the actual NO species, once liberated from these carriers, are short lived. 23 The majority of cutaneous cell types, including adipocytes, endothelial cells, melanocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, Langerhans cells, neutrophils, and macrophages express some isoform of NOS and are therefore able to generate and release NO for a broad array of physiologic processes. 16, 24, 26, 29 Keratinocytes are the major constituent of the epidermis and express all three NOS isoforms. They produce NO and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in response to inflammatory stimuli. This likely acts as one of the chief protective mechanisms of the skin, as the epidermis is constantly exposed to foreign matter and organisms. Additionally, NO synthesis on the skin surface may also regulate the growth of cutaneous commensal organisms. 24 In the acidic skin environment, reactive nitrogen intermediates are formed, such as nitrous acid (HNO 2 ), dinitrogen trioxide (H 2 NO 3 ), and peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2212 ), which may serve as a nonspecific defense mechanism against cutaneous pathogens. 30 In addition, finely regulated responses are also exhibited by NOS species; wound healing is one example. Fibroblasts, found in the dermis, are key regulators of dermal remodeling by synthesizing extracellular matrix, collagen, and fibrin, while orchestrating many of the complex steps of wound healing. Fibroblasts express eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS, 24 but this expression is inconsistent across different cells and possibly depends on cell maturation. Due to its widespread distribution, NO can help regulate basic physiological roles such as establishing and maintaining blood flow, protective responses against invading microorganisms, ultraviolet light-induced melanogenesis, and development of erythema and edema in the setting of a sunburn. 24",

            "text": "NO has several intrinsic antimicrobial properties and is therefore vital to the body's innate immune response in the defense against invading microbes. 17, 18, 24, 26, 31 One of the main mechanisms is its ability to generate RNOS via spontaneous reactions with oxygen or superoxide. These RNOS include peroxynitrite (OONO \u2212 ), RSNOs, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), dinitrogen trioxide (N 2 O 3 \u2212 ), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4 ). 13, 19, 25 These RNOS are thought to exert NO's antimicrobial effects because they induce nitrosative and oxidative stress that is toxic to microbes. 8 Peroxynitrite is formed during the oxidative burst in macrophages and is the most highly reactive and potentially cytotoxic of these RNOS. 32 RNOS nitrosate protein thiols and modify amino acid residues and thus can inactivate essential enzymes. 15 They can also nitrosylate metal centers (Fe-S), further modifying protein functioning and depleting intracellular iron stores. These events ultimately block essential microbial processes. 1, 21, 29, 33, 34 RNOS also damage microbial DNA, and they do so via a variety of mechanisms, including direct RNOS interaction with DNA, inhibition of DNA repair and replication, and increased synthesis of genotoxic mediators such as alkylating agents and H 2 O 2 . 15, 28 OONO \u2212 can also induce DNA strand breaks and abasic sites, among other alterations. 13,21,28 OONO \u2212 and NO 2 have also been implicated in lipid damage and peroxidation with subsequent disruption of the microbial membrane. 15, 33 Importantly, NO's ability to execute its antimicrobial properties is dictated by its concentration. At low concentrations, NO exerts its antimicrobial properties by acting as a potent immunostimulatory molecule. 33 In this role, NO mediates immune cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, cytokine production, expression of adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules, and synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix constituents. 35 As NO concentration builds secondary to iNOS activation, its inherent antimicrobial properties come into play. 15 The importance of iNOS activation to combat infection was demonstrated by iNOS knockout mice having greater susceptibility to herpes simplex virus infection, higher frequency of viral reactivation, and delayed viral clearance from dorsal root ganglia as compared to infected heterozygous mice. 36 iNOS knockout mice are also more susceptible to Dengue virus infection, and were found to have significantly higher viral loads and greater mortality compared to wildtype mice. 37 Similar results were seen in mice treated with the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine: treated mice were more susceptible to Salmonella typhimurium infection and death. 38, 39 NO provides less feedback inhibition to iNOS compared to eNOS and nNOS, allowing for a bolus production of high NO levels to thwart a microbial threat. 15 Antimicrobial Spectrum NO has demonstrated activity against a variety of pathogens, 14 including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. 29",

Constant exposure to 80 ppm of gNO inhibited P. aeruginosa and S. aureus growth, and gNO was bactericidal at 160 ppm. 26 gNO delivered at 200 ppm for 24 h was bactericidal against a variety of clinically relevant pathogens, including S. aureus, MRSA, E. coli, Group B Streptococcus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. 40 When gNO was administered intermittently to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli in short durations and at high doses (160 ppm), the same bactericidal effect was demonstrated compared to continuous gNO delivery. However, it took 10 h longer to achieve this effect. 7 Furthermore, the utility of intermittent gNO treatment may be limited in vivo because the time between treatments may permit bacterial replication; this possibility warrants further investigation. The efficacy of continuous gNO treatment was also evaluated in vivo: S. aureus was inoculated into full-thickness wounds in the New Zealand white rabbit; wounds were then treated with 200 ppm of gNO for 8 h a day for three consecutive days. Treatment caused significant reduction in wound bacterial burden. 56 Although effective as an antimicrobial, gNO is limited because of its expense, required delivery from a gas tank, length of time required for treatment, requirement for nonambulation during therapy, and potential toxicity to host cells from the production of NO 2 and development of methemoglobinemia. 7, 23, 25, 27, 40 Furthermore, gNO is not the best candidate for topical antimicrobial therapy because its short half-life prevents delivery to deep wounds. 8",

Firstly, the rate and duration of NO release can be modified by alterations in np size, composition and surface hydrophobicity. 10 Secondly, toxicity can be minimized by varying the ingredients used for np synthesis. Thirdly, np synthesis can incorporate specific functional groups to maximize targeted delivery as well as to enable medical imaging. 10 Finally, nps are advantageous because their small size enables them to surpass biological barriers that impede targeted delivery of drugs in other forms. through which encapsulated sodium nitrite is thermally reduced to NO within the polymeric nps. 16 This platform is based on established silane-based sol-gels made from either tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) or tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Sol-gel refers to the transition of a system from a liquid 'sol' into a solid gel phase. 23, 67 Sol--gels are capable of trapping proteins and other large molecules, yet they remain porous to smaller molecules like NO, which can limit their drug delivery capabilities. To overcome this limitation and minimize porosity, glass-forming sugars and polysaccharides like chitosan can be added during sol-gel synthesis to essentially plug up these pores. 23, 67 The resulting glassy properties are also of benefit because the matrix promotes the thermal reduction of nitrite to NO, as well as NO retention and sustained release. 16, 23 The final NO-np formulation is stored in a powder form. The NO remains trapped in the matrix when dry, permitting easy storage. Upon exposure to an aqueous environment, NO release is initiated as the nps swell from taking on water. 4, 16, 31 The rate and total quantity of NO release can be modified by altering the synthesis steps, such as changing the concentration of nitrite or polyethylene glycol's (PEG) molecular weight and/or concentration. 4, 15 For example, the utilization of larger PEGs increase pore size, allowing for a rapid bolus-type NO release pattern, whereas NO-nps made with smaller PEGs demonstrated a slower, sustained NO release over time. NO-nps were minimally toxic to treated human lung fibroblasts and reconstituted human epidermis in vitro. 16, 68 Human lung fibroblasts treated with NOnps in vitro demonstrated minimal toxicity compared to those cultured with media and control particles. This suggests that these NO-nps are therapeutic agents safe for topical application. 16 Furthermore, no clinical adverse events were reported in murine models of infection treated with NO-nps. The ease of synthesis, storage, administration and control over NO release makes NO-nps attractive for a broad range of clinical scenarios, including the treatment of SSTIs.",

Biofilms represent a serious therapeutic impediment given their ability to block drug penetration as well as permit transfer of resistance genes between communal cells. 72 It is hypothesized that the ease with which NO diffuses across biological membranes may allow for its enhanced penetration into biofilms compared to traditional antibiotics. 32 Therefore, an NO-delivering platform may be one avenue to address this challenge. 72 applied to a murine model of MRSA-infected fullthickness wounds, NO-np-treated wounds clinically demonstrated accelerated wound closure ( Figure 3 ) and significantly lower bacterial burden as compared to controls. Histological examination of wounded tissue showed that those infected wounds treated with NO-np had less inflammation, more organized granulation tissue, and less destructive changes to dermal architecture than in controls. 69 In an analogous study, these NO-nps were applied to a murine model of MDR A baumanniiinfected full-thickness excisional wounds. Similar to their effect on MRSA-infected wounds, NO-nps significantly increased the rate of wound healing (Figure 4) , even more so than in the MRSAinfected wounds, decreased wound bacterial loads, and inhibited collagen degradation. 70 A. baumannii is an increasingly common etiologic agent of nosocomial infections, and is also implicated wound infections in soldiers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its resistance to many antibiotics complicates treatment of such infections; 70 therefore, the success of topical NO-nps in the treatment of A. baumannii wound infections is promising. ",

In light of this, Friedman et al.'s hybrid NO-nps were evaluated for the treatment of both of these clinical entities in murine model. Both topical and intradermal NO-np application significantly reduced intradermal abscess area ( Figure 6 ) and bacterial burden. Treatment resulted in improved preservation of dermal and subcutaneous architecture, with less inflammation, and bacterial presence on histologic exam. 68 In a mouse model of MRSA-infected intramuscular abscesses, both topical and intralesional administration of the hybrid NO-nps also significantly decreased MRSA burden within the muscle compared Figure 7) . Histologically, intralesional NO-np administration resulted in less muscle necrosis, granulomatous inflammation, and decreased bacterial load compared to control mice. While vancomycin did have a significant impact on the intramuscular abscesses as compared to untreated, the outcome was not to the extent as those animals treated with the NO-nps. 33",

In doing so, GSNO can reversibly block enzyme and protein functioning and disable key pathogen machinery. To counteract the threat to cell viability that results from nitrosation of critical cellular elements, bacteria employ GSNO reductases 40 and nitroreductases, and also regenerate GSH. 34 GSNO serves as a stable reservoir for NO donation and is advantageous compared to NO because S-nitrosothiol half lives are measured in minutes to hours, compared to the seconds-long halflife of free NO. 27 Additionally, as described above, GSNO is a potent nitrosating agent, conferring it with antimicrobial activity that threatens microorganism viability. In fact, the antimicrobial efficacy of GSNO in solution against E. coli has been previously reported. 34 To elucidate GSNO's impact on bacterial growth and survival, Friedman et al. evaluated the ability of the hybrid NO-nps to generate GSNO in the presence of GSH. 34 When combined with GSH, NO-np not only formed GSNO, but also produced significant concentrations of GSNO over an extended time period (greater than 24 h). This is likely secondary to the controlled and sustained release of NO from the NO-np, which corresponds to steady GSNO formation. The mixture of NO-np with GSH significantly inhibited the growth and/or survival of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa compared to controls and NO-np alone. K. pneumoniae was the most resistant to this formulation, whereas P. aeruginosa was the most susceptible and exhibited no growth over 24 h. 34 Given the static and cidal activity of NO-npgenerated GSNO in vitro, the efficacy of this platform was evaluated in the previously described excisional wound model infected with an MDR clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa. Wounds treated with NO-np + GSH exhibited significantly accelerated wound closure clinically and histologically, as well as lower bacterial burden based on tissue cultures when compared to NO-np-treated and control wounds. The finding that NO-np + GSH was more effective than NO-np correlates to the in vitro data in that P. aeruginosa may be more sensitive to nitrosothiols as opposed to NO. In both the in vitro and in vivo setting, NO-nps + GSH had greater antimicrobial activity compared to NO-nps alone. This may be because GSNO is a more stable reservoir for NO and because it is a potent nitrosating agent, capable of rendering microbial proteins inactive. Additionally, GSNO can be actively taken up by microbial systems that usually function to import GSH. This enables GSNO to reach intracellular bacterial targets that NO cannot access. These results are promising and further highlight the versatility and applicability of NO-nps to a wide array of clinical scenarios. 73 ",

NO's small size and hydrophobic nature enable it to rapidly traverse bacterial membranes, where it can significantly impact and interfere with cell function. Importantly, it has been shown that multiple bacterial species do not develop resistance to exogenous NO even after multiple exposures and cell passages-it is therefore unlikely that resistance would develop, as it would require multiple mutations to occur simultaneously. 8 Despite the proven antimicrobial efficacy of a variety of NO donors, many have limitations that preclude their use in clinical settings. Recent advances in NO delivery, particularly the use of nanotechnology, are promising. The ease of nanoparticle production, storage, administration, and modulation render it an attractive therapeutic modality for SSTI. Its design for local application minimizes the risk for systemic toxicity associated with traditional, systemically administered antibiotics. The proven in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy provide further evidence that NO-based nanotechnologies have the potential to treat SSTI caused by a variety of pathogens, including those with resistance to traditional antibiotics. Their therapeutic use in combat and/or disaster situations in which specialized medical care or technology is not readily available would be ideal given the breadth of physiologic, and importantly, antimicrobial, activities. 17 NO-nps are an innovative approach and promising solution to the treatment of SSTI in the setting of escalating bacterial resistance.",
