The name COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, was proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. The virus was officially named as \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u2019 (SARS-CoV-2) [2]. The incubation period of COVID-19 falls within 2 to 14 days according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3], although the incubation period could be up to 24 days in rare cases [4]. Symptoms of the infection include fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Computed tomography scans showed patchy shadows or ground glass opacities in the lungs. Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia and shock, and the mortality rate was 2.3% according to a large-scale retrospective study [5]. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has evolved into a global health threat within weeks. As of 27 February 2020, there were 82,294 confirmed cases involving 47 countries [6]. There were 92 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, including both imported and local cases [7]. This paper aims to share our local experience to help ophthalmologists globally to take necessary measures to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients.",

            "text": "According to the WHO, during previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contacts and fomites, suggesting that the mode of transmission of COVID-19 could be similar [8]. As of 14 February 2020, 1716 healthcare workers in China were infected with COVID-19 and six of them died [9]. One of them was Dr. Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital. In early January, he contracted COVID-19 from an asymptomatic glaucoma patient and succumbed to the disease one month later [10]. There were anecdotal reports suggesting that individuals may be infected by patients with subclinical infection [11], either by droplets or by direct contact with secretions from infected cases followed by subsequent inoculation into mucous membranes. Anecdotal reports suggested that when no eye protection was worn, the virus could also possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva and cause infection [12\u201314]. Hence the close proximity between ophthalmologists and patients during slit lamp examination and direct ophthalmoscopy may pose an infectious risk to ophthalmologists. Ophthalmologists may also be caught off guard as conjunctivitis, though uncommon, could be the first presenting symptom of COVID-19, before the appearance of other symptoms such as cough and fever [12, 13]. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has issued an alert advising ophthalmologists to wear masks and eye protection when seeing conjunctivitis patients with respiratory symptoms and history of international travel [14]. Moreover, in 2003, the SARS coronavirus was isolated from SARS patients\u2019 tear samples [15] and thus, it is possible that the novel coronavirus may also be present in tears of COVID-19 patients.",

Furthermore, since ophthalmic consultations often involve multiple investigations, including visual acuity, intraocular pressure measurement, pupillary dilatation and others, it is not uncommon that patients have prolonged stay in the clinic to complete the whole examination [17]. All these factors potentially increase the risk of cross-infection, between patients and between healthcare workers and patients, in outpatient clinics in ophthalmology than other clinical disciplines.",

Informing a large number of outpatients to reschedule their appointments is often challenging. We took advantage of short message service (SMS) to send information to patients via their electronic mobile devices, at least one week in advance before their scheduled appointments, providing them with an enquiry phone number so they could call to postpone their appointments and consider drug-refill if appropriate. Out of 1117 SMS sent out during the first week of February 2020, we had an encouraging response rate of 23.5% (262 responses). 24.6% of patient attendance was reduced as a result. Medical records would be screened by ophthalmologists and new appointments were sent out by post.",

It is therefore necessary to ensure that fever patients are identified before they enter the clinical area. A triage station was set up at the entrance of eye clinic. All patients and their accompanying persons were screened using infra-red thermometers. Fever patients were provided with health advice pamphlets and were advised to seek medical attention and reschedule their eye clinic appointments if their eye conditions were non-urgent.

These shields acted as barriers to droplets and they were cleaned and disinfected after every clinic session, or if the shields were visibly soiled or contaminated.

Nevertheless, due to variations in outbreak severity and individual hospital settings in different localities, we suggest ophthalmologists to consult their local infection control experts for detailed risk assessment before deciding on the extent of infection control measures to be implemented in their own clinical settings. As the novel coronavirus infection is still in uprising trend, it is of paramount importance to remain vigilant and start taking necessary measures to prevent its transmission.",
