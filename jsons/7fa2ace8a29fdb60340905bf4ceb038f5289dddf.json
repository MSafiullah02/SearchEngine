In particular, we verify a given clustering result for the GISAID data set, which was obtained analyzing the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic trees. For this purpose, we use alignment-free dissimilarity measures for sequences and combine them with learning vector quantization classifiers for virus type discriminant analysis and classification. Those vector quantizers belong to the class of interpretable machine learning methods, which, on the one hand side provide additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations, and on the other hand can be equipped with a reject option. This option gives the model the property of self controlled evidence if applied to new data, i.e. the models refuses to make a classification decision, if the model evidence for the presented data is not given. After training such a classifier for the GISAID data set, we apply the obtained classifier model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus data set. On the one hand side, this allows us to assign new sequences to already known virus types and, on the other hand, the rejected sequences allow speculations about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences.",

Investigations of the virus sequence are of special interest. Frequently, those are based on mathematical/statistical analysis. However, machine learning methods represent a promising alternative, if one focuses on interpretable models, i.e. those that do not act as black-boxes. Doing so, we apply variants of Learning Vector Quantizers to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We encoded the sequences and compared them in their numerical representations to avoid the computationally costly comparison based on sequence alignments. Our resulting model is interpretable, robust, efficient, and has a self-controlling mechanism regarding the applicability to data. This framework was applied to two data sets concerning SARS-CoV-2. We were able to verify previously published virus type findings for one of the data sets by training our model to accurately identify the virus type of sequences. For sequences without virus type information (second data set), our trained model can predict them. Thereby, we observe a new scattered spreading of the sequences in the data space which probably is caused by mutations in the viral sequences. 18 SARS-CoV-2 genome [11]. The molecular differences in coronavirus populations were 19 investigated using phylogenetic trees so far resulting in three clusters which are 20 identified as virus types [12]. Yet, SNP-based radial phylogeny-retrieved trees of 21 SARS-CoV-2 genomes result in five major clades [11]. Generally, a disadvantage of 22 those decision-tree-like approaches is the problem of out-of-sample considerations, i.e. 23",

            "text": "new data cannot easily be integrated [13, 14] . The respective tree has to be reconfigured 24 completely, which frequently leads to major changes in the tree structure [15, 16] . 25 Frequent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes are in the genes encoding the S-protein 26 and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein. Applying a sequence alignment 27 and similarity comparison using the Jaccard index, a method for monitoring and tracing 28 SARS-CoV-2 mutations was established in [17]. However, a general mathematical 29 evaluation of similarities is crucial because respective similarity measures only partially 30 reflect all biological aspects of similarity between RNA sequences [18]. Alignment based 31 methods usually rely on variants of the Levenshtein distance [19], which, however, are 32 computationally costly: O (n 1 \u00b7 n 2 ) is the time complexity for both the 33 Needleman-Wunsch-algorithm [20] and for the Smith-Waterman-algorithm [21, 22], 34 2/24 where n 1 and n 2 are the sequences length. Hence, if n 1 = n 2 = n the complexity is 35 simply O n 2 . Both approaches solve internally a mathematical optimization problem, 36 i.e. both algorithms belong to the algorithmic class of dynamic programming with high 37 computational complexity. Other alignment based methods consider (multiple) longest 38 common subsequences with similar complexity [23]. 39 Therefore, alignment-free alternatives are promising [18, 24-28]. Most common those 40 approaches are Bag-of-Words (BoW, [29]), information theoretic methods based on the 41 Kolmogorov-Smirnov-complexity [30] and the related Normalized Compression 42 Distance [31, 32]. Recently, similarities based on Natural Vectors gained 43 attraction [33-35]. These methods have in common that the sequences are considered in 44 terms of their statistical properties and distributions of the nucleotides. However, local 45 information like precise nucleotide positions as well as specific motifs are lost. An 46 overview of prominent measures and their behavior for sequence analysis can be found 47",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 viruses, whose origin 2 lies probably in Wuhan (China), is a severe respiratory disease [1] . Currently (May 3 2020), it is spreading rapidly all over the world [2] . Yet there are several indicators that 4 the molecular characteristic evolves during time [3, 4] . This evolution is mainly driven 5 by mutations, which play an essential role and maybe accompanied by mechanisms of 6 stabilization [5, 6] . 7 The analysis of the genomic structure by sequencing is currently topic of ongoing 8 research to better understand the molecular dynamics [7] . Obviously, changing the 9 genomic structure may cause new properties and, hence, could increase the difficulties 10 in finding drugs for treatment. For example, changes may lead to behavioral changes, 11 such as the increased binding of the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein to human ACE2 12 receptors [8] . 13 Viruses of the family Coronaviridae possess a single stranded, positive-sense RNA 14 genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length and frequently are extremely 15 similar [9] . Therefore, the analysis of those sequences to understand the genetic 16 evolution in time and space is very difficult. This problem is magnified by incorrect or 17 inaccurate sequencing [10] . Further, mutations are not equally distributed across the in [36, 37] . 48 In the present publication, we investigate whether alignment-free dissimilarities are 49 suitable for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 clusters/classes in combination with 50 interpretable machine learning methods for clustering and classification [38, 39] . This we 51 do for two data sets: GISAID-data and NCBI-data. For the first one, virus classes 52 (types) were identified by phylogenetic tree analysis in [12] , whereas the second one is 53 without class information. 54 Although deep neural network approaches provide impressive results in sequence 55 classification [16, [40] [41] [42] , deep architectures are at least difficult to interpret [43] . 56 Therefore, we focus on applying prototype based methods using alignment-free 57 dissimilarity measures for sequence comparison. In fact, prototype-based machine 58 learning models for data classification and representation are known to be interpretable 59 and robust [44] [45] [46] . Using such methods for the SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, first we 60 verify the classification results for the GISAID-data. In particular, we classify the 61 sequences by a learning vector quantizer, which is proven to be robust and 62 interpretable [45, 47] . Thereafter, we use this model to classify the new data from the 63 NCBI. Moreover, this interpretable classifier provides correlation information regarding 64 data features contributing to a class discrimination. This additional knowledge allows a 65 further characterization of the virus classes. 66 Materials and methods 67 68 In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 viruses in terms of sub-type spreading, two virus 69 sequence data sets were considered. 70 The GISAID Dataset D G 71 The first one, abbreviated by D G , is from the GISAID coronavirus repository (GISAID - 72 Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data). It consists by March 4th, 2020 of 73 254 coronavirus genomes, isolated from 244 humans, nine Chinese pangolins, and one 74 bat Rhinolophus affinis. After preprocessing, 160 complete human sequences are 75 obtained as described in [12] , where these genomes of SARS-CoV-2 have been used to 76 create a phylogenetic network. The resulting network analysis distinguished three types 77 of the virus (cluster) A, B, and C: A is most similar to the bat virus, whereas B are 78 3/24 sequences obtained from A by two mutations: the synonymous mutation T8782C and 79 the non-synonymous mutation C28144T changing a leucine to a serine. A further 80 non-synonymous mutation G26144T changing a glycine to a valine lead from B to type 81 C. In this sense, the classes (virus types) code implicitly the evolution in time of the 82 virus. 83 In our data analysis, we removed two sequences, whose accession numbers occur twice 84 in the data record, and another two, which we identified as not human resulting in 156 85 final sequences. Additionally, we take the type/class information as label for the virus 86 genome sequences and, hence, as reference. A detailed data description as well as 87 complete list of sequences can be found in [12] . The virus type assignments and 88 additional data (country, collection date) as well as accession numbers for all 156 89 sequences in use are additionally provided in the supplementary material.",

The Median Neural Gas algorithm (MNG) is a neural data quantization algorithm for 158 data compression based on dissimilarities [56, 57] . It is a stable variant of the k-median 159 centroid method improved by neighborhood cooperativeness enhanced learning, where k 160 is the predefined number of representatives [58, 59] . In this context, median approaches 161 only assume a dissimilarity matrix for the data and restrict the data centroids to be 162 data points. Thus, after training, MNG provides k data points to serve as 163 representatives of the data. Thereby, the data space is implicitly sampled according to 164 the underlying data density in consequence of the so-called magnification property of 165 neural gas quantizers [60, 61] . 166 It should be emphasized that despite the weak assumption of a given similarity matrix, 167 MNG always delivers exact data objects as representatives. Hence, any averaging for 168 prototype generation like in standard vector quantizers is avoided here. This is essential, 169 if averaged data objects are meaningless like for texts, music data, or RNA/DNA 170 sequences, for example.",
