Current methods are therefore restricted to viral purification by the use of isopycnic gradients (Keller et al., unpublished) to obtain sufficient target read coverage for viable bioinformatics analysis. While viral purification by isopycnic gradients allow a high purity of viral RNA, only RNA from encapsulated viruses are obtained (Liu et al., 2011) , making this technique unfeasible for the study of unassembled viral genomes, which have also been shown to be crucial to our understanding of viral replication machinery (Moon et al., 2015) ( Manokaran et al., 2015) .",

This was corroborated by our direct RNA sequencing results. Indeed, unpurified viral RNA represented by the pre-capture group did not produce sufficient throughput for any meaningful downstream analysis due to the indiscriminate nature of the sequencing of both host and viral RNA. However, after treatment with our capture method, the amount of host RNA background has decreased greatly as seen from the 272 fold increase in mapping rates to target viral RNA. More significantly, the recovery of the whole DENV1 genome and the much higher read coverage across DENV1 obtained from sequencing concentrated post-capture RNA further demonstrates the superiority of our capture-based purification method even to PCR enrichment methods. In comparison, even with the incorporation of PCR amplification for shotgun sequencing of enterovirus, Jensen et al. (2015) reported only a 2-13 fold increase in mapping rates to enterovirus. This suggests that our capture-based purification method is highly successful in the removal of host RNA background. The minimum coverage required for variant calling was, as described above, benchmarked to that of Illumina reads so that the effectiveness of our capture-based purification method could be more accurately evaluated based on the higher error read rates of direct RNA sequencing technology.",

(unpublished) utilized a custom sequencing adapter complimentary to the 3' end of influenza A viral genome to obtain sufficient sequencing throughput. However, this will be highly unviable for samples where viral strains or genotypes, as with viruses cultured from clinical samples. An appropriate example is the wide diversity in hepatitis C virus genotypes, which has caused issues in PCR primer design for target enrichment strategies due to sequence ambiguity (Thomson et al., 2016) . On the same tangent, Cowan et al. (2005) noted that PCR-based enrichment techniques where a priori knowledge of target sequences is required for PCR primer design render the enrichment strategies ineffective in the characterization of novel viruses. It follows that the same sequence ambiguity would pose a problem for using customized sequencing adapters during direct RNA sequencing. Our method fundamentally allows for the capture of unknown viral strains and genotypes due to the flexibility of using multiple baits complementary to different regions of the viral genome, or even multiple baits specific to different viruses in the hybridization step of our capture method. Indeed, Deviatkin et al. (2017) has reported the successful use of genus-specific degenerate baits for hybridization-based enrichment, which can be seamlessly incorporated into our bait design.",

            "text": "One point of concern for our protocol is the low capture yield. However, it must be noted that the capture yield is still significantly higher than that of conventional viral purification methods. Hall et al. (2014) , in a study evaluating conventional viral purification methods, reported a 100 fold decrease in viral copy number posttreatment, whereas our method results in, at most, a 14 fold decrease in viral copy number. In evaluating our capture-based purification method, a wide range in capture yield was observed, which was due to the high sensitivity of RNA to potential contamination during handling. This is problem common to We recommend that the capture should be performed in a sterile workspace, strictly adhering to basic RNA handling procedures. We also recommend visual inspection to ensure that no beads are pipetted during stringent washing and clean-up steps are done to prevent accidental removal of bead-bound RNA during the capture. It is of utmost importance during the stringent washing that heated washes be done quickly to increase stringency, and that tubes are inverted and gently shaken to wash off any contaminants in the 1.5mL tubes. Aggressive vortexing is likely to cause some mechanical shearing of RNA and so we recommend gentle agitation of the tubes to re-elute during washing and clean-up steps.",
