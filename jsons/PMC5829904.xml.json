Children, elderly and immunocompromised adults are most at risk of contracting the virus.3\u20135 Children younger than 5 years of age seem to be particularly susceptible to HMPV. Previous studies,6\u201312 which were mainly conducted in developed countries, have revealed that approximately 2.5%\u201311.3% of respiratory samples were positive for HMPV in children \u22645 years, and 90% of individuals were seropositive for HMPV by 5 years of age.13",

ARI was defined as an illness that presented with at least two of the following clinical presentations: cough, nasal obstruction, coryza, sneeze and dyspnoea during the previous week. Patients, who were diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography during the previous week, were also included in the study, even if they did not show the clinical features described above. Some patients, who had been cured and discharged some time ago and readmitted because of new episodes of ARI, if met the recruitment criteria, were included in the study as new cases, otherwise excluded. Chest radiography was performed based on the clinical situation of the patients. The samples were collected according to established clinical protocols.17 The samples were refrigerated at 2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C in viral transport medium, transported on ice to the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and analysed immediately or stored at \u221280\u00b0C before analysis as previously described.18",

Patients with vomiting, poor appetite or diarrhoea were categorised as having gastrointestinal illness. Some patients were assigned to several clinical presentation groups. Patients with incomplete clinical data were excluded from this analysis. Increased lung markings, bronchopneumonia, pneumonia and bronchiolitis were diagnosed by chest radiography.

This may be explained by the immunity against HMPV, which is passed down from mother to child, gradually subsiding over time. Moreover, children were more contact with outside world as they grew older. Therefore, children of this age need more attention to prevent HMPV infection. Moreover, our findings suggested no difference in risk between sex, there was no significant difference in the HMPV prevalence between male and female patients (P=0.771), which is consistent with previous studies.35 36",

Consequently, it is possible we will have incomplete or even an inaccurate description of patients\u2019 manifestations. Second, because our study mainly focused on HMPV, other common respiratory pathogens, including bacterial pathogens, were not tested and subsequently our study does not give a fully account of respiratory pathogen infection in hospitalised paediatric patients with ARI. Third, the characteristics of patients who are HMPV negative and outcome data (discharge/death) were not analysed further, because our study only focused on the epidemiological and clinical features of HMPV positive cases. This might affect our understanding of the clinical features of patients who are HMPV positive. Despite these shortcomings, our results provide a valuable insight into the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HMPV present in patients hospitalised with ARI in Guangzhou, Southern China.",
