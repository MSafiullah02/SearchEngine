All viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and need to enter cells to replicate. Nucleic acid genomes delivered to the cytoplasm provide a template to generate new genomes which in turn initiate the synthesis of mRNA that encode viral proteins. These processes require the assembly of complex replication machines that ensure that genome replication and packaging are carefully coordinated. For many viruses this is achieved by concentrating virus genomes, replicase proteins, and the host proteins required for replication in a \u2018mini-organelle\u2019 called a virus factory or \u2018viroplasm\u2019 (Netherton et al., 2007, Fernandez de Castro et al., 2012).",

Viruses are grouped into the \u2018RNA\u2019 or \u2018DNA\u2019 viruses according to the nature of their genome. The (+) strand genomes make an mRNA that is immediately translatable, and the complimentary RNA or DNA sequence is called negative (\u2212) strand. This means that the genomes of (+) strand RNA viruses can function as mRNA while the (\u2212) strand RNA viruses need to be delivered into the cell with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that uses the negative template to make the (+) strand. In both cases virus replication occurs in association with cytoplasmic organelles and (+) RNA is translated by ribosomes into protein. The genomes of most DNA viruses are made from double-stranded DNA and most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus because they need to recruit host proteins for DNA replication. The DNA viruses also show temporal gene expression with genes being expressed at early, intermediate, and late times during infection. Early genes are expressed before the onset of replication while late genes are normally used for replication and assembly. The small DNA viruses, for example, polyoma and papillomaviruses have limited coding capacity and do not make their own DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DdDp). The large DNA viruses, for example herpes viruses and poxviruses encode their own DdDp, but the herpes viruses still rely on nuclear factors for genome replication. Interestingly, the poxviruses encode all the enzymes needed for DNA and mRNA synthesis, and replicate in the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Evolution has not been blind to viral infection and cells make several proteins that recognize viral genomes as danger signals because they are different from host DNA or RNA. The RNA viruses are a good example because replication of RNA from an RNA (rather than DNA) template generates a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediate that is not generated by the host cell. Recognition of dsRNA in plants, insects, and other primitive animals results in gene silencing while in vertebrates this leads to activation of interferon (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). Cells also contain sensors for viral DNA that activate proinflammatory responses (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2011). The concentration of replicase proteins within virus factories would be expected to provide a potent signal for activation of these defenses. Viruses have overcome this problem by using virus factories to shield replication intermediates from recognition by nucleic acid sensors, but at the same time the factories retain connections to the cytoplasm to allow export of nucleic acid to sites of genome packaging.",

            "text": "The mammalian alphaviruses, for example, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and the rubivirus rubella virus are members of the \u2018Togavividae\u2019 and encode a single polyprotein called nsp1234 that contains the helicase, methytransferase, and RdRp. Proteolytic processing releases the RdRp (P4) which binds to P1,2,3 and is targeted to membranes by a hydrophobic domain in P1 (Figure 1(a)\n). The structural proteins are generated as a second polyprotein encoded by a sub-genomic message which is formed when the RdRp transcribes RNA from an internal initiation site. A signal sequence exposed after removal of the capsid protein directs synthesis of envelope proteins by ribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The \u2018Togaviridae\u2019 generate large \u2018cytopathic vacuoles\u2019 with 50 nm diameter invaginations called spherules aligned along the inside face of the vacuole. The vacuoles contain replicase proteins and are derived from endosomes and lysosomes. Spherules can be generated from many different membrane-bound organelles. Flock house virus, an insect virus, generates spherules in the outer membrane of mitochondria (Figures 1(b) and 1(c); Miller et al., 2001) while Brome mosaic virus, a plant virus, generates spherules in the ER. In each case the spherules are of similar size and contain approximately 100 copies of the replicase protein packed along the inner membrane surface (Kopek et al., 2007). The interior of each spherule is connected to the cytosol by a thin membrane neck that surrounds a channel wide enough to allow passage of (+) RNA into the cytosol allowing assembly with capsid proteins. Spherule formation involves the assembly of replicase proteins on the cytoplasmic face of membrane-bound organelles where they induce negative curvature forcing membrane to invaginate into the organelle. Multivesicular body formation is topologically similar where ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) proteins assemble on the cytoplasmic face of endosomes generating vesicles that bud away from the cytoplasm into the endosome. Recent work has shown that proteins of the ESCRT-III complex are required for proper formation of spherules where they may drive spherule closure and at the same time maintain the channel that allow genomes to pass into the cytosol (Barajas et al., 2014, Diaz et al., 2015).",

The flaviviruses are enveloped viruses and the initial processing of the polyprotein exposes signal sequences that direct synthesis and processing of the polyprotein by the ER. The NS5B protein at the C-terminus of the polyprotein is targeted to the cytoplasmic face of the ER by hydrophobic domains in NS4A, NS5A, and NS5B. The flaviviruses generate 80\u2013100 nm diameter invaginations into an ER membrane connected to spherical vesicles and convoluted membranes (Figure 2(b)). These invaginations are less well organized than spherules, even so the spherical vesicles contain the viral polymerase and dsRNA and each has a pore opening to the cytosol that could allow exit of viral RNA for packaging with capsid proteins and envelopment (Welsch et al., 2009, Romero-Brey et al., 2012). The genome of the coronaviruses (CoV) is similar in organization to the flaviviruses, but these viruses are the most complex of the (+) strand RNA viruses and encode as many as 15 nonstructural proteins. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are between 150 and 300 nm diameter connected to the ER (Figure 2(c); Knoops et al., 2008). The infected cells also contain convoluted tubular and reticular membranes, and later during infection \u2018vesicular packets\u2019 appear where vesicles are surrounded by a common outer ER membrane (Knoops et al., 2008). It is thought that replication occurs in the convoluted membranes and that genomes are transported to vesicular packets for envelopment and budding.",

This is cleaved by the viral protease 3Cpro to generate capsid proteins from VP1-4 and replicase proteins from 2ABC and 3ABCD. The RdRp is encoded by 3Dpol which is targeted to membranes by hydrophobic domains in 3A, 2B, and 2C. Picornaviruses generate large numbers of membrane vesicles which vary between 200 nm and 400 nm diameter and some have double membranes (DMVs) while others have single membranes. These DMVs were observed in the first electron micrographs generated from cells infected with viruses in the 1960s (Dales et al., 1965) and their precise origins are still in dispute. The sizes and relative numbers of vesicles vary greatly between picornaviruses families and it is not clear whether single or DMVs house the RNA polymerase. For enteroviruses, such as poliovirus and coxsakievirus, replication may take place on tubular membranes generated during the log phase of virus production, and these may been seen as single membrane vesicles in cross section in electron micrographs (Limpens et al., 2011, Belov et al., 2012). Single membrane tubes may gain curvature following progressive assembly of replicase proteins or through recruitment of reticulon proteins (see below) leading to formation of DMVs (Figure 3(a)). The DMVs generated during picornavirus replication lack an obvious opening to the cytosol making it possible that they seal and are a by-product of replicase assembly and used to store viral RNA.",

            "text": "The DMVs seen in cells infected with enteroviruses may be formed from autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are generated by a membrane trafficking pathway called autophagy that delivers portions of the cytosol to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is activated during many viral infections and capture by autophagosomes can lead to destruction of viruses in lysosomes. It was therefore a surprise when it was discovered that poliovirus benefits from autophagy, with virus yields increasing some 10-fold when autophagy is activated during infection (Jackson et al., 2005, Wileman, 2006). The poliovirus replicase proteins associate with autophagosomes during infection and co-expression of 2BC and 3A in cells generates autophagosomes and DMVs (Schlegel et al., 1996, Suhy et al., 2000). It is currently believed that poliovirus 2BC and 3A activate autophagy during infection allowing replication to take place on the surface of autophagosomes. The enteroviruses infect via the gastrointestinal tract and are resistant to acid pH and proteases. It is likely that they can survive in lysosomes and there is evidence that low pH promotes maturation of the poliovirus capsid before release from cells by exocytosis (Richards and Jackson, 2012). Autophagosomes are used as sites of assembly for the replicases of other picornaviruses such as coxsackieviruses, human enterovirus 71, and encephalomyocarditis, but the role played by lysosomes during virus release is less clear. Unlike the enteroviruses, FMDV is very susceptible to low pH and this facilitates disassembly of the virus during endocytosis and cell entry. This sensitivity to low pH makes it unlikely that the FMDV would survive in autophagosomes or lysosomes. Autophagy is, however, activated during FMDV infection but this takes place early during infection before the nonstructural proteins are synthesized, and can be activated by empty capsids and UV inactivated viruses that cannot replicate (Berryman et al., 2012). It is thought that FMDV capsids activate autophagy during cell entry and this is consistent with the co-localization of capsid proteins with autophagosomes.",

The positive curvature of ER tubes is maintained by a family of proteins called reticulons which have hydrophobic domains that insert into the outer leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer (Diaz and Ahlquist, 2012, Tang et al., 2007). The picornavirus 2C proteins that provide a scaffold for the 3Dpol polymerase and target the replicase complex to membranes bind reticulon proteins and replication is reduced in the absence of reticulons. Most DMVs are derived, at least in part, from the ER, making it possible that reticulons play a key role in the formation of DMVs.",

Lipids can also provide sites for assembly of replicase complexes. The RdRp (3Dpol) of poliovirus and coxsackievirus, for example, binds phophatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4-P). This means that recruitment of the 3Dpol polymerase can be increased if membranes contain increased levels of PI4-P. For some viruses this is achieved by manipulation of host proteins that control membrane traffic through the secretory pathway. The 3A protein of poliovirus and coxsackievirus increases the activity of the Arf1 GTPase and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Under normal circumstances activation of Arf1 by GBF1 results in formation of the COP1-coated vesicles that carry proteins from the Golgi to the ER. Activation of GBF1 by the viral 3A protein, however, results in recruitment of an alternative Arf1 effector protein, phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase-III\u03b2 (PI4-III\u03b2) to membranes (Hsu et al., 2010). The enzyme phosphorylates PI4 to generate PIP-4 providing membranes enriched in PIP-4 which recruit 3Dpol. A similar mechanism may operate for flaviviruses (Reiss et al., 2011, Berger et al., 2009) and coronaviruses (Verheije et al., 2008) where replication and membrane remodeling are reduced following inhibition of the Arf1 GTPases or phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase-III.",

The Bunyamwera virus serves as a good model for this family of viruses. The genome is segmented into three (\u2212) strand RNA strands named according to their size. The long (L) segment encodes the RdRp, the medium segment encodes a polyprotein that is processed by the ER to make the envelope proteins Gn and Gc which travel to the Golgi apparatus, while the small segment encodes the nuclear protein (NP). One copy of each segment is packaged within the virus and each segment binds one copy of the RdRp and the rest of the RNA strand is protected by several NP proteins. On entering the cell the RdRp copies each (\u2212) strand to make (+) strands that can be read as mRNA. Infection of cells with Bunyamwera virus results in the formation of tubules within the Golgi apparatus which form the virus factory (Fontana et al., 2008). These tubules contain the RdRp, NP, and viral RNA. It is likely that they function as specialized spherules for generating new genome segments which are assembled with the RdRp and NP. The formation of the factory in the Golgi apparatus would facilitate delivery of RNA segments budding into late Golgi compartments during virus assembly and envelopment.",

            "text": "The nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) are a family of large DNA viruses with genomes ranging from 150 kb to 1.2 MB. The family includes the poxviruses iridoviruses, African swine fever virus (ASFV), phycodnaviruses, and mimiviruses that share several conserved core genes. The NCLDV infect a wide range of hosts including mammals, arthropods, fish, and marine plankton, but all replicate and assemble in large factories located close to the nucleus at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) (Figure 4\n). The factories contain viral DNA and structural proteins but lack cellular membranes and are very similar to inclusions called aggresomes that form during protein misfolding diseases (Heath et al., 2001, Wileman, 2007). Protein misfolding leads to the formation of small protein aggregates in the cytosol which are transported along microtubules by dynein motors to the MTOC where they encounter the major cellular pools of chaperones and proteasomes. If aggregates fail to fold, or exceed the proteolytic capacity of the proteasomes, they accumulate within an aggresome surrounded by mitochondria and a cage made from the vimentin filaments (Figure 4(a)). The inclusions also contain ubiquitin and a linker protein called p62/SQSTM1 that binds ubiquitin and LC3. LC3 is the major membrane protein of the autophagosome and p62 is used to remove ubiqutinated proteins from aggresomes into autophagosomes which deliver them to lysosomes for degradation. Virus factories and aggresomes share many features in common including recruitment of chaperones, proteasomes, and mitochondria and confinement within a vimentin cage. Many viruses are recognized by dynein after entering cells and delivered to the MTOC. It is possible that incoming virus capsids stimulate an aggresome response because they appear foreign or misfolded to cells (Wileman, 2007). For the NCLDV this may be beneficial and provide transport to a site for replication, for other viruses it may represent an innate immune response leading to confinement at the MTOC and degradation.",

During cell entry the poxviruses release a viral core into the cytoplasm which binds dynein motor proteins (Figure 4(a)). The core immediately starts the synthesis of at least 100 early genes using a viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The mRNA transcribed from early genes by the polymerase are delivered into the cytosol as the core travels to the MTOC. The early proteins encoded by the mRNA are used to break open the core to release viral DNA through a process requiring proteasome-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated capsid proteins. Poxviruses are unusual DNA viruses because they encode all the enzymes needed for DNA and mRNA synthesis and do not need to travel to the nucleus. The viral genomes remain at the MTOC where they create a factory by providing a template for DNA replication and generation of viral mRNA encoding intermediate and late genes. Interestingly, for poxviruses it appears that intermediate and late proteins are synthesized within the factory rather than in the cytoplasm. This means that viral mRNA is retained within the factory and that the factory recruits cellular factors needed for translation. Detailed analysis of poxvirus factories shows that cavities within the viral DNA recruit viral mRNA, intermediate and late proteins, and host cell translation initiation factors such as eIF4g and eIF4e. The results suggest that translation of viral mRNA takes place on ribosomes recruited into the factory, and that sites of translation are segregated from sites of genome replication (Katsafanas and Moss, 2007). Viral structural proteins are retained in the factory until they are assembled into new viruses which are carried into the cytosol along microtubules.",

The cores deliver the genome to the nucleus where it provides a template for the formation of short precursor fragments that are exported to the cytosol for replication. The formation of the ASFV factory begins with the removal of cellular material from the MTOC where it is replaced by a high concentration of vimentin filaments arranged into an \u2018aster\u2019 aligned along microtubules. This site also recruits chaperones and mitochondria. Following the onset of DNA replication the vimentin filaments are rearranged into a cage surrounding virus DNA and delineate the edges of the factory (Figure 4(b)). The factory is kept at the MTOC by microtubules and becomes dispersed through the cytosol if microtubules are depolymerized. The rearrangement of vimentin into a cage requires phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of vimentin that is important for filament assembly by host cell calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKinase II). This phosphorylation is required for replication because inhibition of CamKinase II blocks late gene expression (Stefanovic et al., 2005). In common with poxviruses, ASFV structural proteins do not leave the factory until they are assembled into new viruses (Figure 4(c)). At late stages in the lifetime of the factory the MTOC is lost and microtubules form bundles in the cytosol. It is thought that this may weaken the factory to facilitate release of viruses into the cytosol.",

The PML-NBs do not move through the nucleus but PML proteins exchange rapidly with the surrounding nucleoplasm. Recruitment into the PML-NB is dependent on addition of ubiquitin-like SUMO proteins to PML, and the presence of SUMO interaction motifs in Daxx and Sp100. Viral DNA entering the nucleus lacks chromatin and this may expose a damage signal that recruits PML-NB proteins which would add chromatin to genomes and repress transcription (Figure 5). For HSV-1 this cellular defense is countered by the regulatory protein ICP0 which is expressed very early during infection. The ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of ICP0 ubiquitinates PML leading to degradation of PML by proteasomes and loss of PML-NBs from the nucleus of infected cells. Evidence that PML-NBs suppress virus replication before they are dispersed by ICP0 comes from the observation that HSV-1 strains expressing defective ICP0s fail to degrade PML, have reduced replication and can fail to proceed to lytic infection. Herpes viruses also use structural proteins to combat PML-NBs. The herpes virus nucleoprotein core is surrounded by a layer of tegument proteins (i.e., viral matrix) that lie beneath the envelope. The human cytomegalovirus tegument phosphoprotein pp71 locates to PML-NBs soon after cell entry and induces degradation of PML, similarly the major tegument protein of Epstein-Barr virus BNRF1 disassembles the Daxx\u2013ATRX complex.

Nuclear aggresomes also appear during herpes virus infection, and in some reports they are called virus-induced-chaperone-enriched (VICE) domains. These domains appear adjacent to sites of replication soon after the dispersal of PML-NBs by ICP0. Proteomic analysis has shown that 20 or more host proteins may be recruited to replication sites. These include proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair, and RNA polymerase II which is used to transcribe the viral genome. As seen for the poxviruses the sub-compartmentalization of the virus factory through the formation of a VICE domain may facilitate replication by sequestering structural proteins away from sites of genome replication and transcription. VICE domains may also store viral proteins, such as the UL6 viral portal protein, and pp65 tegument protein, that are prone to aggregation when they are made in excess over levels needed for the assembly of new viruses. Evidence that aggregation of viral proteins is detrimental to replication comes from studies of HCMV strains expressing a defective tegument protein called UL97. UL97 is a kinase that can reduce protein aggregation (Prichard et al., 2005). Drugs that inhibit the kinase activity of UL97, or mutations that abolish kinase activity, reduce replication and induce the formation of aggresomes containing tegument proteins.",

Precisely where this occurs in the nucleus is not known because the PML-NB markers are dispersed by ICP0. The genomes of HSV-1 expressing a defective ICP0 accumulate in large PML-NBs making it likely that replication takes place within the residue of the PML-NB or VICE domain. Once genomes have been generated in the factory they have to be assembled with capsids. Capsid proteins are synthesized on ribosomes in the cytosol and imported into the nucleus where they assemble with scaffold proteins and a portal protein to generate empty immature capsids. Import of the genome through the portal results in proteolysis and loss of the scaffold and formation of the mature capsid. These events take place in the nucleus and early studies identified an \u2018assemblon\u2019 as a site of virus assembly, seen late during infection which contains tegument proteins and aggregated capsids. The assemblon may serve as a site of virus assembly early during infection and becomes the VICE domain/nuclear aggresome at later times when structural proteins are made in excess over levels that can be packaged into viruses. Fully assembled capsids pass across the nuclear envelope and enter the cytoplasm where they are enveloped in the trans-Golgi network before release from the cell.",

DNA viruses are transferred from the MTOC to the nuclear pore complex for disassembly and release of the DNA genome into the nucleus. In many cases the RCs form close to the nuclear envelope next to a nuclear substructures called promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NB) which vary between 100 and 1000 \u00b5m in diameter and contain PML Daxx, Sp100, and ATRX (i). PML-NBs have also been called nuclear aggresomes (ii) because they accumulate misfolded proteins, cellular chaperones, proteasome subunits, and ubiquitinated proteins. Viral DNA entering the nucleus lacks chromatin and exposes a damage signal that recruits PML-NB proteins to add chromatin to genomes and repress transcription (iii).
