Under certain network structures, it is then possible to obtain a closed form study of the underlying transmission pattern [10], [12]. In particular, [12] studied the transmission of an epidemic among a population whose individuals are connected both locally and globally.

The important feature of both SW and SF networks is that they are highly connected: the average path length between random individuals is relatively short. Moreover, for SF networks, the node degree distribution follows a scale-free distribution. Hence, in many areas of natural and physical science, this new model structure has unveiled a rich range of behaviours. In this paper, we apply these methods to the modelling of the spread of SARS in Hong Kong; transmission is only allowed to occur along a limited number of direct links between individuals. By doing this, we will avoid making one of the assumptions underlying standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models: a homogeneous fully connected population. The SIR model assumes that all individuals are susceptible to the disease and all suffer an equal, small, positive probability of contracting the virus. This homogeneous model leads to a continuous and smooth inter-day distribution of infections. Irregularities in this are usually attributed to random variation and non-stationarity in the model parameters.",

While it is impossible to predict the occurrence of such outbreaks, SW\u2013SF models provide a more realistic physical model of the relationships between individuals in a community and will therefore provide a better picture of the true disease dynamics. Note that, since one cannot actually predict when a particular SSE will occur, one cannot accurately model the timing of the peak in the time series of Fig. 1. Moreover, it is not possible to accurately model the initial SSE at the Prince of Wales hospital, which \u201ckick started\u201d the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong.

Individuals can be susceptible (S), prone (P), infected (I), or removed (R). The transmission path is depicted in Fig. 2\n. Infected individuals can cause susceptible individuals, to whom they are linked, to become prone with some probability (p1 or p2). By infection we mean the transition from the susceptible state to the prone state. Infected individuals can cause their immediate neighbours to become infected with probability p1; long range links cause infection with probability p2. Prone individuals become infected with probability r0 and, finally, infected individuals become removed with probability r1. Just as in the SIR model, we do not distinguish fatalities from recoveries: in either case, the individuals are assumed to have acquired immunity. The model states that we describe here bear a close correspondence to the four states of the SEIR model. The prone state is analogous to the exposed (E) state in the SEIR model. We choose to use the new term P because the epidemiological state is slightly different. By prone we mean both the infected but not infectious (incubation) period and the pre-symptomatic period. For SARS, all infections in Hong Kong could be traced to contact with a symptomatic individual.2\nHence, for the purposes of modelling transmission, we assume that, during the pre-symptomatic period, there is no chance of transmission. Moreover, to calibrate our model with the observed data (which, by definition, are hospital admissions), we further prescribe that the time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalisation is constant (or, equivalently, follows a stationary unimodal distribution).Fig. 2The top panel depicts the transmission state diagram: S to P based on the SW structure and the infection probabilities p1,2; P to I with probability r0; and I to R with probability r1. The lower panel depicts the distinction between \u201clocal\u201d (i.e. short range) and \u201cnon-local\u201d (long range) network links. The lower panel shows the arrangement of nodes in a small-world network. The black (infected) node may infect its four immediate neighbours with probability p1 and three other nodes (hashed) with probability p2.",

The population of N nodes is arranged in a regular grid, of side length L (L2=N), and each node is connected directly to n1 immediate neighbours.5\nAn infected individual will infect each of its n1 neighbours (provided that they are still susceptible) with probability p1. Furthermore, each node has n2 non-local (i.e. long distance) links (see Fig. 2). These are links to nodes that are geographically remote from one another; infection occurs along these pathways with probability p2. For each node i, the number n2(i) is fixed, and so are the links to its n2(i) remote neighbours once they are established. The number n2(i) is chosen to be proportional to a decaying exponential fX(x)\u221de\u2212x\u03bc with parameter \u03bc proportional to the expected (average) number of links to remote nodes, where n2(i)=\u230ax\u230b.

In this paper, we assign an exponentially decaying probability distribution to any number of links, and (for uni-directional links) this is sufficient to generate the necessary SW properties. An SF network requires a power-law distribution of the number of links (which can consequently lead to more nodes with many more links) and we do not examine that case here. The SF distribution of the induced network of actual infections has been considered elsewhere [16].",

(8), subject to (7), in [0,1].\u2022The epidemic is under control if nk=n1kp1+\u03bcp2<r1 (Section 2.2).\u2022For the endemic case, the rate of growth of infection is 1\u2212r0+r12+14(r0\u2212r1)2+nkr0.\n\u2022This model exhibits behaviour consistent with both SSEs and persistent localised transmission (Section 3.4). More extreme SSEs can be observed simply by fattening the tail of the distribution of links. By assigning a power-law distribution to the number of nonlocal links that a node has, one can readily obtain SSE involving many hundreds of secondary infections from a single source.\u2022An SSE does not imply highly infectious individuals, only highly connected ones (Section 3.4).\u2022Theoretical results and model simulations are unlike the true data, unless exposure time is significantly greater than an average of three days (2.2, 3.3). If the exposure time is three days or less, the rate of growth of the epidemic is significantly lower than that observed in the true data.\u2022Nosocomial transmission was therefore a key factor in the acuteness of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003. Effective control of hospital transmissions would have prevented a serious outbreak (Section 3.3). With respect to nosocomial transmission, our model therefore confirms what has been observed independently, and suggested by many authors.\u2022Simulations of our model, with minimal parameter variation, produced dynamics indistinguishable from the true data. These same parameter values exhibit a wide variety of behaviours (Section 3.5). Hence, any effort to actually obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates from the observed data is futile. Despite this, our calculations show that the true data is certainly typical of our models. Moreover, our models exhibit a marked long-tailedness both in infection times and epidemic lifetimes.\u2022The likelihood of infecting fewer than 20 people was approximately 0.18, and the likelihood of infecting more than 1000 was 0.27 (Section 3.5).\n",

            "text": "Apart from deriving analytic expression for the spreading and control of an epidemic, the main results of this study, when applied to the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003, is that our data is consistent with the observation that the epidemic that occurred was largely preventable. The primary factor for the severity of the outbreak was poor infection control in the hospital setting and the delayed introduction of quarantine and community isolation practices. This is consistent with various discussions presented elsewhere. However, we note that nosocomial transmission was considered only by supposing (admittedly erroneously) that the time between becoming symptomatic (and infectious) and hospitalisation is constant. Nosocomial transmission is simulated by changing the expected duration between becoming symptomatic (I) and becoming removed (R). Although this is perhaps unconventional from an epidemiological viewpoint, it is probably the best that we can do, as the only data that we have to work from is the date of hospital admission. This conclusion is in contrast with work done by Pastor-Satorras and colleagues [20], [21] with scale-free SIS type [7] disease models. In that case, they found that the disease would almost always persist and that random immunisation was ineffective [21].",

We model the inter-connection between nodes with one-directional links (rather than the bi-directional links we would expect for social contacts) because this makes the network much easier to construct, without sacrificing any realism. This model could easily be extended to exhibit scale-free characteristics, by simply altering the distribution of non-local links (to follow a power-law distribution). Doing so would produce simulations with a larger number of highly connected individuals, and therefore we could simulate the largest SSEs in the data. The results presented in this paper show small (less than 100 individuals) SSEs; extension to the power-law distribution would provide SSEs with a larger number of secondary infections.",

Certainly, we cannot exclude the (quite likely) probability that other parameter values also produce behaviour of which the observed data is typical. Therefore, in this paper we only draw conclusions based on our observations of parameters that produce behaviours that are either typical or (more importantly) atypical of the observed data. Although we have observed that our model exhibits more realistic dynamics than SIR models, it is only a model. And, like the SIR model, our model is a compromise between complexity and realism. We intend to address this problem in the future by applying Monte Carlo Markov Chain models [22] to this sparse data [23].",

Apart from repeating, or modifying, this analysis for different infectious diseases (such as HIV AIDS), we imagine that these techniques could be useful in the theoretical study of quarantine and isolation practices, as well as disease transmission among isolated communities. Quarantine can be effectively modelled as a limitation of long range transmission. One can easily model change in quarantine by varying the parameter \u03bc (or alternatively, but not equivalently, p2). This should provide a new, simpler approach to the study of quarantine to supplement compartmental models such as those described in [25].",
