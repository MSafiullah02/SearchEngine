In each, localized, often mild outbreaks were followed some months later by massive waves of illness and mortality, often in younger age groups.2 Virulence varied widely; the 1918 to 1920 pandemic (also caused by an H1N1 strain) was by far the worst, killing 20 to 40 million people worldwide. The 1968 to 1970 pandemic was the mildest of the 4. But in each instance, the toll of deaths and illness substantially exceeded that of a typical flu season.3\n",

Between May 15 and June 15, more than 44,000 people with influenza-like illness had visited New York City emergency departments (EDs) compared with 4,267 the year before. Total ED visits increased by 32%, from 325,135 the previous year to more than 428,000.9 In some communities, ED use surged by 50% to 100%.10 Because the second wave of influenza pandemics is typically larger than the first, officials worried at the time that a sustained surge of ED visits could worsen already dangerous waits for emergency care,11 overload EDs, and promote iatrogenic transmission of influenza from individuals with flu to medically fragile patients nearby.",

In an accompanying disclaimer, the CDC stated that the algorithm was intended for use \u201cby physicians and those working under their supervision.\u201d It was also limited to patients older than 18 years. Five days later, US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Katherine Sibelius announced the posting of an H1N1 self-evaluation application at http://www.Flu.gov. It closely adheres to the CDC's adult algorithm and used many of the terms and phrases we devised for our demonstration Web site. It is intended for use by adults older than 18 years. The same day (October 7, 2009), Microsoft Corporation unveiled its own flu self-assessment application at http://www.H1N1ResponseCenter.com. Like Flu.gov's application, Microsoft's site closely adheres to the CDC's adult algorithm and uses health-literate language licensed, at no charge, from Emory University. Both HHS and Microsoft encouraged health departments, nongovernmental organizations, private health plans, employers, and other organizations to link to their Web sites free. Many chose to do so.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics worked directly with the CDC on a pediatric algorithm, which was posted on the CDC's Web site on October 16 (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/clinicians/pdf/childalgorithm.pdf). As soon as this pediatric algorithm was posted, we began drafting health-literate content to offer the guidance directly to the public through the Web. Unfortunately, the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this effort because the algorithm was not prospectively validated.
