This CoV strain had the capacity to spread from person to person, and many of the infected people became severely ill with SARS. The official toll from the multifocal epidemic that ensued was 8,422 cases and 816 deaths on five continents.1 This startling epidemic demonstrated the continuing risk of zoonotic diseases for humans and the awesome potential for emerging diseases to wreak havoc around the globe. SARS brought several ethical issues associated with new, severe epidemic diseases into sharp focus.",

Secondary pneumothorax developed in other patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or who had catheters inserted into veins near the pleura.

The responses of physicians who have faced risks from contagion throughout history have been mixed. Many physicians fled epidemics of plague that swept repeatedly across Europe.5 During an epidemic of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, some physicians stayed and performed heroically while others fled.5 As medicine became a rigorous scientific discipline in the twentieth century, physicians gained increased respect and power, and the medical profession became more cohesive and developed integrated, widely accepted ethical codes. A social contract developed between physicians and society, whereby in return for substantial income, high social prestige, and professional autonomy, physicians are expected to go to great lengths to provide optimal care even in perilous times.6 This social contract exists throughout the world. Section 29.1 of the Professional Code and Conduct for the Guidance of Registered Medical Practitioners of the Medical Council of Hong Kong reads in part, \u201cAll patients, including those with serious contagious/infectious diseases, are entitled to timely and appropriate investigations and treatment.\u201d7 The American Medical Association Declaration of Professional Responsibility reads in part, \u201cWe, the members of the world community of physicians, solemnly commit ourselves to: \u2026 (3) Treat the sick and injured with competence and compassion and without prejudice; and (4) Apply our knowledge and skills when needed, though doing so may put us at risk\u2026.\u201d8\n",

It was clear early on that cases were occurring in health-care workers. By the end of the epidemic, approximately 30% of reported cases were in health-care workers, and some died.11 We know now that the primary mode of spread was by respiratory droplets, but that fomites and aerosolized feces also spread the virus under some circumstances. The rate of spread from most people with SARS to household or casual contacts was only moderate. Occasionally, large numbers of people became infected from single ill individuals, so called \u201csuperspreading events\u201d that remain poorly understood. The potential for spread was substantial within the health-care setting, but we know now that intensive but widely available, practical infection control measures effectively prevented transmission.12, 13, 14 A case control study in Hong Kong found that personnel who used gowns, masks, and gloves, and washed their hands regularly did not come down with SARS while other personnel who were less scrupulous did become ill.14 In multivariate analysis, wearing masks (N95 or surgical masks) was the single practice that seemed to be protective. By analogy, other frightening epidemic viral diseases like Ebola or Lassa fever have spread from patients to healthcare workers when modern infection control practices have not been followed or have not been possible because of lack of resources in underdeveloped countries. However, when supplies and equipment widely available in developed countries have been provided and infection control practices have been followed, health-care workers have been protected.15, 16, 17\n",

When it became clear that people were faced with a new transmissible disease and after strict infection control practices were implemented, those who followed these practices were protected. Optimal care of patients with a new infectious disease may entail invasive tests or surgical procedures. Rational steps should be taken to reduce risks whenever possible. If multiple management or treatment options are available and they can be expected to result in equivalent, optimal patient outcomes, options that pose lesser risks to health-care providers should be selected. The overriding principle for our patients and our profession is that that we must provide the best possible care to patients.
