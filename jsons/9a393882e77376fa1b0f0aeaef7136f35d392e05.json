            "text": "Live and killed vaccines constitute the vast majority of vaccines currently in use. Live vaccines are prepared from attenuated pathogens that are almost or completely devoid of pathogenicity but are capable of inducing a protective immune response. Dead vaccines are produced by killing and administering the whole pathogen, or by using a purified component of the pathogen. There are both advantages and disadvantages of using live over dead vaccines. For example, live vaccines may be able to induce a greater degree of protection for a longer period of time. However, there is also a risk of reversion to virulence associated with the use of a live vaccine; obviously this is not a risk for killed vaccines. Vaccines available for use in cattle in the UK are summarised in Table 1 (NB: This only includes products included in the NOAH Data Sheets Compendium).",

BS40 5DU Cattle immunology: vaccination and immunological testing are under the control of a single owner and tend to have relatively little contact with animals on other holdings. Compare this to the situation in human or small animal medicine, where the decision to vaccinate is taken at an individual level, so there is little effective ability to control the proportion of the population which is vaccinated against a disease. It is well recognised that this is an important factor in the success of vaccination programmes to protect against infectious disease.",

Many vaccines rely on vaccination of the entire group of animals to decrease level of disease in the population, thereby decreasing the exposure of the animals to the pathogen and making protection provided by the vaccine more effective. Examples of situations in which this opportunity is commonly missed include: G vaccination against calf pneumonia of dairy-bred heifer calves intended as replacement stock, whilst not vaccinating the beef cross or dairy bull calves that are housed in the same accommodation G vaccination of a single cohort of animals within the adult herd (first lactation heifers are sometimes vaccinated in herds which do not vaccinate the cows against the same pathogen).",

            "text": "Another important concept is the understanding that immunity (vaccinal or natural) is not a 'binary' state (i.e. animals are not simply 'immune' or 'na\u00efve'). Immunity tends to increase after vaccination, peak within a few days to weeks (depending on vaccine type and route of administration) and then gradually decline. Vaccines are often licensed to provide a certain duration of cover, but it is still worth being aware that protection is likely to be more effective early in the period of cover. Good examples of utilising this knowledge can be found in adult dairy cows. Vaccines against bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) and leptospirosis are amongst the most commonly used cattle vaccines in the UK, and vaccines with label claims for 12-month protection are available against both diseases. However, the principle that animals will be less well protected in the period before revaccination is due can still be useful: G Infection with leptospirosis is more likely at pasture: therefore peak coverage should logically apply during the grazing season, so annual vaccination should be timed to early spring G The major aim of BVD vaccination is to prevent cows becoming infected around the time of conception and early pregnancy (as this could lead to failure of conception, embryonic loss or production of a persistently infected calf): therefore vaccination should logically be completed before the breeding period. In seasonally-calving herds, this is a practical possibility (and is often done), but in year-round calving herds would mean vaccinating smaller numbers of cows over the course of the year rather than vaccinating the herd as a batch.",

Many vaccines prevent only a single strain of a disease, and may provide limited or no cross-protection against other strains. A good example of this is vaccination against bluetongue virus (BTV). The currently licensed vaccines in the UK protect only against BTV-8 (the strain that has been diagnosed in the UK); other strains of the virus are present in continental Europe and could easily enter the UK. Although many CATTLE G PRACTICE UK Vet -Vol 14 No 4 July 2009 3 farmers are well informed about BTV, there are still a large number that are unaware that the currentlyused vaccines do not protect against other strains which may be a threat.
