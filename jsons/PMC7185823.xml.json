Techniques for blood collection are described in detail elsewhere. Most reference laboratories are willing to provide the practitioner with specimen containers designed for smaller volume samples, such as micro-gel separator tubes, both plain and coated with lithium heparin, and smaller calcium or sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid tubes for submission of whole blood. Submitting small volume samples in standard-sized tubes containing anticoagulant may result in dilutional artifact because of improper ratio of anticoagulant to sample (Fig 1).\n",

Techniques for ultrasonography of small exotic mammals and various reptile species have also been described. Ultrasound machines should be equipped with a transducer suitable for the size of the animal, with a small footprint or contact area. Transducers with frequencies from 7.5 to 12 MHz will be the most useful. Many standard ultrasound machines can be fitted with probes of this frequency. Color Doppler is advantageous for assessing blood flow, but it is harder to interpret. Most new ultrasound machines are capable of digital recording to facilitate further review after contact with the patient is completed. Ultrasound-guided biopsy of organs can be performed as in traditional pet species.",

The endoscope and light source are the minimum equipment required for visualization of the oral cavity, ear canal, and nasal cavity of small exotic mammals (Fig 2). However, more advanced techniques such as endoscopic evaluation of the urethra, bladder, and vagina, and abdominal or thoracic endoscopy require a diagnostic sheath to allow insufflation of sterile fluid or air to enhance visualization. The diagnostic sheath also allows introduction of a variety of instruments for sample collection for cytology, culture and sensitivity, and/or biopsy.3 All endoscopic procedures benefit from the addition of a camera to allow viewing of images on a monitor, and an image capture system to save images for education, documentation, or teaching purposes. In reptiles, diagnostic endoscopy is most often used to examine the oral cavity, coelomic cavity, vent, urinary tract, and even portions of the reproductive tract of female animals.4, 5\n",

Several manufacturers make smaller, inhalant anesthetic cones and endotracheal tubes with narrow interior diameters (for example, 1.5 mm). In exotic mammal medicine, intubation of rabbits, ferrets, and larger exotic pets is common. Laryngoscopes with straight Miller blades sizes 0 or 1 facilitate intubation and visualization, particularly in small carnivores. Intubation of smaller mammals is technically much more challenging than that for the larger exotic species previously mentioned. Endoscopically guided intubation may be useful in these difficult cases. Johnson recently described this technique in rabbits, ferrets, prairie dogs, chinchillas, and guinea pigs using a semirigid 1.9-mm endoscope (Focuscope; MDS Inc., Brandon FL USA).7 This may be exceedingly more difficult to impossible to perform in chinchillas and guinea pigs using a true rigid endoscope that is incapable of making the slight bend required to direct the endoscope and tube into the trachea. Other equipment that may aid intubation includes a variety of mouth gags, one designed specifically for ferrets (Nazzy Ferret Mouth Gag; USI/BSI, Universal Surgical Instruments, Glen Cove, NY USA).",
