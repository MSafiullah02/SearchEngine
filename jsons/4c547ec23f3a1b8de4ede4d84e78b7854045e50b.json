Despite the remarkable and necessary increase of food availability in a context of intense demographic transition, food insecurity has not been eradicated, with a persistent number of persons suffering from undernutrition while obesity spreads dramatically in all countries. In addition, diets (Willett et al. 2019 ) and food systems stand at the heart of a nexus that links nutrition, health, the viability of ecosystems, climate change, political stability and social justice, and can be considered a lever to address the whole 2030",

New connections between the environment, health and the food sectors are already made (Morand et al. 2016) . New behaviors and norms will affect consumption and international exchanges rules and patterns. The lock-in of frontiers, supply disruptions and global trade dysregulation will contradict the governance doctrine which has prevailed for the last decades to ensure food supply. The unquestioned faith in the trade capacity to ensure supply will give way to sovereignty, a forgotten approach at the national level and left to promote local alternative to globalization. As local processes will undoubtedly gain traction, organizing the right balance between local, national and international supplies will be challenging, in order to ensure access to healthy food everywhere, at all moments, at an affordable price, while limiting loss and waste and preventing global overproduction and related impact on the environment. Opposing scales is not appropriate, as processes taking place at each of them are strongly articulated. National and international contexts and regulations should not be omitted as they influence the potential of local initiatives to serve as models and to structure in return national action and global frameworks.",

This lead Bi\u00e9nabe et al. (2017) to urge public and private actors to invent regulations in agri-chain. Time has come to do so, providing that social and greenwashing are avoided. In innovatively articulating long and short distance supply chains, territory will play a key role. This is the level at which consistency and arbitration between economic, social and ecological dimensions of all sectors may be politically achieved through inclusive process. Commons offer an asset (Elinor 1995) and the design of common projects a way between State and market for addressing future challenges. Territory can be considered an alternative to embed and anchor economic dynamics into political regulation. Territorial development may contribute to reframing public action and policies at all levels and open an avenue to transform the world (Caron et al. 2017 The risk exists to forget about the crisis and continue until the next one as if nothing happened. It is amplified by the irreducible dualism which has taken place between those who deny sustainability concerns and oppose any change and those who advocate for a revolution to prevent an announced collapse. All are convinced they defend the general interest. Strategies to delegitimize opponents of all sides, as well as doubt or certainty selling behaviors will not make transformation easy. All knowledge resources will be required as well as reshaping the role of technology to move beyond binary opposites between positivism versus reject stances.",
