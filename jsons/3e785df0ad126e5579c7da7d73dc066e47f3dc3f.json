It increases user's comfort and diagnosis quality of chronic cardiac and/or high-risk patients. This paper covers the enormous data to be transmitted from the ECG device to the physician's, namely the cardiologist's, control unit. Existent ECG devices uniformly sample analog signals and convert them to digital samples which are compressed before data transmission. However, event-driven sampling simultaneously compresses and samples. Therefore, this paper quantitatively compares successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) compression and level-crossing analog-to-digital converter (LC-ADC). Evaluation metrics are the percent root-mean-square difference (PRD), bit compression ratio (BCR) and data length in bits. When a 12-bit reconstruction is operated on the outputs of an 8-bit LC-ADC with 12-bit and 10-kHz reference counter, the BCR is equal to 80% for 75% of test ECG signals. That is better than the 71.87% BCR of the 12-bit 1-kHz SAR ADC with DWT compression. The modeled LC-ADC guarantees a signal quality in terms of PRD comparable to the PRD of the SAR ADC with DWT compression. The data length in bits of the LC-ADC is lower than the data length in bits of the SAR ADC with more than 14-bit resolution with DWT compression for 82% of the test ECG signals. However, for lower resolutions, to obtain lower power consumption for radiofrequency transmission, a better alternative remains the SAR ADC with DWT compression. sensors, become increasingly vital to the twenty-first century patients. Increased need for ECG devices is driven due to rising healthcare costs and increasing rates of CVD worldwide. These factors drive the demand for low-cost, reliable and wearable ECG devices. These devices allow ECG signal acquisition [5] , digital signal processing [6] and data transmission to the remote physician, namely the cardiologist [1], for abnormal ECG signal analysis [1] . This leads the authors to focus on ECG signal acquisition but not only ECG features extraction. Commercialized wearable ECG devices as QARDIOCORE by Qardio [7] and wired ECG devices derive from 1 to 12 signals, known as leads in medical context. Each is composed of the P wave, the QRS complex and then the T wave.",

Apple Watch Series4 also records a single-lead ECG for 30 s and detects only atrial fibrillation or normal heart rhythm. QARDIOCORE, meanwhile, detects heart rate variability without diagnosis prediction. It records 3 ECG signals or leads with a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at 600-Hz sampling frequency. It sends a message via Bluetooth wireless communication to the connected smartphone. Then, the smartphone transfers the message to the physician within few seconds.

In the scientific literature, to optimize or reduce data transfer, decrease sensors' power consumption and increase wireless sensor network lifetime, three research axes have been developed. First, communication protocols consider the optimization of data communication between the healthcare sensors or devices, the patient's smartphone and the hospital server [10]. Second, radiofrequency (RF) transceiver is miniaturized to realize a comfortable wearable smart sensor as in [11] . Third, message data length of the ECG is reduced in order to optimize the data transfer via a given wireless communication transceiver [12] . In this context, this paper argues that the event-driven ECG sensor should be used to reduce message data length and to optimize data transfer.",

Data are uniformly extracted at every sampling period, considering at least Nyquist frequency according to Shannon theorem [5] . In fact, sigma-delta ADCs offer higher resolutions than Nyquist ADCs, but generally require higher power consumption due to their oversampling technique. Besides, the maximum frequency of ECG signal is 250 Hz [15, 16] . Consequently, the sampling frequency must be higher than 500 Hz according to Shannon theorem. ADC survey shows the successive approximation register ADCs (SAR ADCs) are more suitable for ECG signal acquisition than pipeline, continuous-time sigma-delta (CTSD), switched-capacitor sigma-delta (SCSD) and flash ADCs according to the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and for a given technology as the 180 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) [17] . Moreover, SAR ADC architectures use few building blocks and thus consume less power than other ADC architectures [18] . Their propagation delays are lower than those of other architectures and are less sensitive to technology accuracy limits of passive components and jitter.",

In this section, the ECG monitoring system architecture is introduced to show its key blocks.

The obtained ECG signal from two electrodes is filtered, amplified then sampled and quantized in the analog front end to deliver the digitized signal. In commercialized systems [1] , ECG signal acquisition is only operated using Nyquist or sigma-delta ADCs. However, in the ECG devices that have been suggested in the literature [20] , level-crossing ADCs have been also employed. The compression is required for Nyquist or sigma-delta ADCs but never quantitatively compared to the inherent compression of level-crossing ADCs. In fact, the LC-ADCs decrease the amount of data compared to Nyquist ADCs and considerably decrease the amount of data compared to sigma-delta ADCs. After compression or source encoding, followed by radiofrequency (RF) transmission, the digital reconstruction block performs signal decompression or source decoding. In case of event-driven devices, interpolation is also required to recover uniform samples. The control unit manages the signal decompression, the digital signal processing and the interpolation. The physician also analyzes the ECG signals using one of his communication devices and saves only received data if required.",

            "text": "Most of ECG acquisition systems generally digitize analog signals with successive approximation register ADC (SAR ADC) as stated in the commercialized systems or in the scientific literature proposals [1] . Indeed, the SAR ADC structure is simply composed of a sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit, a comparator to compare the sample to the previous estimation, successive approximation of registers (SARs) and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) [18] . The DAC delivers the analog value of the previous estimation. The SAR ADC converts an analog ECG signal into digital samples. Thus, the T-to-P ECG waveform, which amplitude variations are lower than 0.1 mV during at least 0.3 s, and the QRS complex, which amplitude is around 1 mV during at most 0.1 s Fig. 1 Configuration of a wearable ECG monitoring system [22] , are sampled at the same frequency [23, 24] . That delivers an important number of redundant samples in the T-to-P ECG waveform. However, sampling only when events occur makes it possible to reduce the T-to-P ECG data. For instance, in the pacemaker proposal in [25] , flexible resolution SAR ADC with asynchronous dynamic logic samples the ECG leads and their features after the QRS complex extraction in the analog domain. Moreover, in [14] , to reduce the data length when sampling an ECG signal with a SAR ADC, the QRS complex is sampled at a frequency higher than the sampling frequency of the remaining parts of the ECG signal. Further compression reduces the number of bits per sample. In fact, after the SAR ADC, a digital adaptive controller is required to compare the difference between successive samples and the predefined threshold to select adequate sampling frequency. The SAR ADC parameters given in [14] are measured only for a test ECG signal. Another SAR ADC-based proposal is to sample the ECG signal at two different sampling frequencies which are selected according to its analog slope extraction [26] . Additionally, authors in [27] propose a high-precision ECG sensor system due to an ADC that integrates a stochastic flash ADC with a digitally controlled variable threshold comparator into a SAR ADC. In addition, a dynamic tracking SAR ADC and a hybrid SAR-sigma-delta ADC are proposed in [28, 29] , respectively. Otherwise, sigma-delta converters are rarely used as in [29, 30] . Indeed, they offer higher resolutions, but require important sampling frequencies due to their oversampling technique [17] .",

            "text": "Therefore, the event-driven signal acquisition is a more appealing architecture than the SAR ADC, also known as level-crossing sampling. It has been introduced since the 1980s as a combined compression digital encoding technique of analog signals [31] , but its circuit implementation or modeling is recent. In fact, level-crossing analog-todigital converter (LC-ADC) architectures are proposed to sample signals regarding amplitude levels instead of time instants. That detects the exact amplitude values instead of the quantized data values. The LC-ADC thus guarantees the conversion of the samples at selected levels. However, it requires a quantization of each interval between two successive level-crossing instants. In the last decade, for instance, authors in [32] and [33] studied event-driven speech and biomedical signals, respectively. Different circuit realizations were particularly proposed for bio-signal acquisitions, ranging from LC-ADCs in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) [34, 35] to fully integrated system-on-chip (SoC) solutions for wearable sensors [20] .",

In fact, the floating-window type is the conventional and the widely adopted type in LC-ADC architectures. It consists of two comparators, two digital-to-analog convert- Not tested for sinewave signal ers (DACs), a logic control and a reference counter clock. First, the comparators detect the input crosses of the analog levels. Second, the DACs create analog levels bounding the input. Third, the logic control obtains up/down slope and evaluates the samples. Fourth, the reference counter clock quantizes the interval between two successive levelcrossing instants. Alternatively, the fixed-window type does not require the updating of the window between two successive analog levels, but it requires the subtraction of the DAC output from the analog input. The obtained difference is compared to the analog fixed levels. Instead of DACs in the LC-ADC, some proposals are based on a scaler to select analog levels for the comparators [40] . Furthermore, authors in [35, 38] suggest other solutions with variable resolutions regarding slope threshold which is the window out of the quantized time between two successive samples. The LC-ADC state of the art is presented in Table 2 . The LC-ADC references are organized according to the LC-ADC resolutions, M, that are sorted from 5 to 8 bits. These values are adequate to digitize the test ECG signals according to the literature. In addition, the reference counter frequency, F C , quantizes the time between two successive level-crossing instants. In Table 2 , the power consumption and core area values are sometimes proportionally computed from other values in the given reference or in a previous reference of the same authors. Table 2 shows that LC-ADC power consumptions vary from 0.0024 to 106 \u00b5W for test sinewave input signals at different frequencies from 1 Hz to 10 kHz. These values are close to SAR ADCs' values from 0.884 to 78.8 \u00b5W when 1 kHz reference frequency is adopted. However, it is important to mention that for low-frequency and low-amplitude inputs, as in T-to-P ECG waveform, the LC-ADC samples less densely in time than for high-frequency and high-amplitude inputs, as in QRS complex. As far as the areas are concerned, they are generally similar because most of SAR ADC and LC-ADC architectures are based on comparators, DACs and digital processing.",

ECG sensor in [20] is tested with an ECG signal, but performances are not measured. In fact, the ENOB of [14] is 6.63 bits for a 10-bit SAR ADC, 1 kHz reference frequency and test ECG signal, whereas it is 7.43 bits [20] for an 8-bit LC-ADC with a sinewave test signal at the input. That ENOB is estimated from SNDR which is computed according to the ECG wireless sensor's input referred noise and input voltage. Therefore, LC-ADC and SAR ADC have almost the same performances leading to similar sensitivity levels [14, 20, 35] . Thus, aside from the combined signal acquisition and inherent compression of analog signals with LC-ADC, many compression techniques have been proposed in the literature. These techniques were implemented and tested on digital test ECG data at the SAR ADC outputs. In the next subsection, the existent compression methods are introduced and compared.",

For example, in ECG acquisition systems, data reduction for the sake of storage is introduced in [41] with amplitude zone time epoch coding (AZTEC). In fact, large amount of ECG data compression is applied either to store or to transmit less data in order to reduce bit rate and time processing while decreasing power consumption [42] .

Combining predictor with entropy coding algorithms makes the bit compression ratios vary between almost 48% and 58% [46] [47] [48] [49] as shown in Table 3 . Combining fuzzy optimization and Huffman region coding offers a BCR of 64.7% [50] . Nonetheless, adaptive trending predictor with modified Huffman and GR coding offers a BCR of 62.5% [51] . In these references, the obtained results are measured for a small number of test ECG signals or for test ECG signals from the same database, generally the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database [21] .",

            "text": "However, nowadays, researchers in the field of smart health sensors adopt higher bit compression ratios with lossy data compression methods that offer a small ECG data distortion. In fact, works in [44, [52] [53] [54] are based on thresholding-based wavelets or discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as lossy compression methods. The best trade-off combines DWT with shrinkage, Huffman and run-length encoding (RLE) algorithms to offer a 96% BCR and 3% Adaptive trending predictor/modified Huffman and GR coding [51] 62.5 PRD comp [53] . Other lossy compression methods are proposed in [42, 55] . They offer around 77% and 87% of BCR with an excellent PRD comp , that is, lower than 2%. In [55] , the method consists in ECG data decimation by a fractional factor. In [42] , the method uses Fun algorithm that is combined with an on-demand residual Huffman coding. Thus, Huffman compression is only applied on the residual data after online decompression and residual data request. As far as [56] is concerned, the proposed compression method detects turning angles larger than a threshold. In fact, the useful information for the diagnosis is in the rapid variations of the P wave, the QRS complex and the T wave. Another proposal comes in [12] to reach a 99% BCR, but only an 8% mean PRD comp is obtained for all test ECG signals of MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. In fact, convolutional auto-encoder is applied to ECG data compression by adopting a spindle structure to extend and then reduce the data length. A more recent work shows a double exponential wavelet design that is combined to compressive sensing [57] . This compression method tries to reach a 90% BCR and a 6.5% PRD comp , but these are mean values obtained from 20 test ECG signals. Additionally, in [58] , the compression algorithm begins by segmentation of the test ECG signal into clinically relevant parts (the QRS complexes and possibly P and T waves) and nonclinically relevant parts (the remaining parts of the ECG signal). The first group is compressed with differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) and run-length encoding (RLE) that are lossless methods, whereas others are compressed due to DWT with threshold which is a lossy method. Table 4 summarizes the lossy data compression state of the art. The obtained results are measured for one test ECG signal [56] , two test ECG signals [58] or all test ECG signals [12] from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Thus, after the SAR ADC, the DWT-based compression methods provide the best trade-off between BCR and PRD comp [53] . In addition, the DWT compression as implemented in [53] does not require test ECG signal segmentation as in [58] , and decompression is always irreversible. However, the LC-ADC seems to be appealing as it simultaneously operates ECG signal acquisition and data compression. Besides, the reconstruction is always irreversible. In fact, although the LC-ADC allows lower amount of data regarding the SAR ADC with DWT compression, quantitative comparative study has not been conducted yet in terms of bit compression ratio, message data length in bits versus signal quality for both architectures. Thus far, the main contribution of this paper is a quantitative comparison between (A1) the SAR ADC architecture with DWT compression and (A2) the LC-ADC architecture. This comparison is important as the lower the message data length in bits is, the lower the ECG sensor power consumption of RF transmission is. In fact, the data length in bits is multiplied by the RF transmission power consumption per bit [14] to obtain the ECG sensor power consumption, knowing that RF transmission results in 63% of the power consumption of a given ECG sensor [13] . Thereafter, the next section describes the evaluation methods for both architectures and defines the evaluation metrics.",

For an orthogonal matrix with no normalized rows to unit, the irreversible decompression is done with the K active columns of \u03a8 and the matrix \u03a6\u03a8 is diagonal. For a biorthogonal matrix, the rows of \u03a6 are biorthogonal to the columns of \u03a8 and the decompression is also irreversible. Thus, each scalar product \u03c6 i \u03c8 j is equal to 1 only if i is equal to j for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 L. Besides, both orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet matrices can be implemented due to tree-structured filter banks. The filter coefficients of the analysis tree are deduced from the decomposition matrix factorization. Meanwhile, the filter coefficients of the synthesis tree are deduced from the wavelet matrix factorization [59] . The number of matrices in a factorization corresponds to J which is the wavelet decomposition level. The filter bank is tree-structured with J low-pass (LP) filters and J high-pass (HP) filters in both analysis and synthesis banks. LP filters in the analysis bank select signal information. These LP filters outputs are known as approximations. However, HP filters in the analysis bank select noise part of the signal. These HP filters outputs are known as details. The approximations and details are truncated to m bits that are the SAR ADC resolution. The selected values that are higher than the threshold, Th, constitutes the DWT compression output, ECG comp . Its length in bits, Lb comp , is equal to m times K that is the number of the selected coefficients, ECG comp . Therefore, in this paper, the DWT compression as a lossy compression is selected for implementation with tree-structured filter banks since the authors study an embedded solution for IoT healthcare devices. The online DWT compression of clinically and nonclinically relevant ECG parts is preferred to off-line solution with lossless compression of clinically relevant ECG parts and lossy compression of nonclinically relevant ECG parts after ECG data segmentation.",

For each family, there are one or more subfamilies according to wavelet family parameters that impact numbers and values of the filter coefficients. After the SAR ADC, DWT-based ECG data compression often uses Daubechies or biorthogonal wavelets. These two wavelet examples of orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet families are widely used and yield good compression ratios [53] even though, to quantitatively compare (A1) the SAR ADC with DWT compression to (A2) the LC-ADC, it is necessary to select the best-fit wavelet subfamily. The objective is to select the best DWT compression to be implemented after the SAR ADC considering the compression ratio, the ECG signal distortion and the implementation complexity. Thus, to select the best-fit wavelet subfamily regarding only the compression ratio, BCR, and the ECG signal distortion, PRD comp , the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is used to obtain an approximation of the signal in the L-by-L dictionary consisting of wavelet subfamily where L corresponds to the number of the SAR ADC samples. In fact, the OMP algorithm aims at computing all coefficients, {\u03b1 i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L}, and selecting the K most significant ones, based on an iterative application of the DWT [62] . Thus, K is provided as the convergence criterion and is also defined as the minimum number of iterations to guarantee a given PRD comp since the OMP selects the most active row of \u03a6 at each iteration. The methodology of the DWT compression study is defined in order to evaluate DWT compression on a uniform ECG data, ECG out , and for a given wavelet subfamily, as shown in Fig. 4 . The DWT compression study, organized in 5 steps, is proposed to select the best-fit wavelet subfamily according to the compression ratio and the ECG signal distortion. The proposed study is achieved through MATLAB simulations including the functions of wavelet toolbox, statistics and machine learning toolbox as well as the signal processing toolbox. In fact, the simulations are based on the function of the denoising and compression wavelet family to perform the OMP algorithm. This algorithm is developed for the sake of rapid MATLAB programming and simulation results.",

A detailed LC-ADC model is already implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and designed according to ECG signal specifications in terms of amplitude and frequency [66] . In order to recover the Behavioral simulations are done with modeled ECG signals for normal, bradycardia and tachycardia [66] and then tested with real ECG records for normal, emotional or physical duress and various pathologies from Physionet database [21] . In fact, the LC-ADC is designed and modeled to cope with all ECG signals that give heart rates from 30 beats per minute (bpm) to 240 bpm [66] . Thus, the LC-ADC full scale, FS, is set to 10 mV, the reference counter frequency, F C , is equal to 10 kHz, and the reference counter resolution, N , is 12 bits for an M-bit LC-ADC where M is equal to 8. In the present paper, the LC-ADC performance evaluation test bench is illustrated in Fig. 6 . As in Fig. 3 , to obtain test ECG signals that represent analog signals, the input data, ECG data , are up-sampled at 1 MHz to obtain the \"analog\" signal, ECG in , with a fine time axis. This \"analog\" signal is the LC-ADC model input. Besides, the signal reconstruction to obtain uniformly sampled signal at F ref , ECG outLC , is operated due to linear interpolation with a p-bit resolution. In fact, the 1 kHz reconstruction frequency and the p-bit resolution are the same as the S/H frequency, F ref , and the resolution, m, respectively, in the SAR ADC to perform the quantitative comparative study. Afterward, the LC-ADC evaluation metrics are computed from three vectors of data obtained during the same time duration. They are the samples at the LC-ADC output, ECG outLC , and the linear interpolation output, ECG outLC , but also the SAR ADC output after truncation, ECGt out , as described in Fig. 3 .",

The test ECG data are the V1 lead of s0044lre from PTB diagnostic ECG (ptbdb) [21] . An example of samples at the LC-ADC output versus the sam- ples at the SAR ADC output is given in Fig. 7 . The patient of s0044lre has a mean cardiac rhythm of 67 beats per minute (bpm) and suffers from myocardial infarction which is a challenging medical emergency. In this example, the Q wave, that is, generally before the R wave, is not observed. Between the pointed data cursors, the LC-ADC delivers S samples, equal to 184, whereas the SAR ADC delivers L samples, equal to 782 samples. Between the pointed data cursors in Fig. 7 , the SAR ADC delivers L samples, equal to 782 samples of 16 bits each. Alternatively, the LC-ADC delivers S samples. This number S is equal to 184 which needs 3680 bits if 8 bits per ECG outLC and 12 bits per TI are sent. However, the LC-ADC can deliver only INC and DEC that are the required bits aside with the first crossed level, ECG outLC (1), to update LC-ADC levels and to provide the exact samples at the LC-ADC output before linear interpolation. This optimization makes the amplitude output requires only 376 bits. As far as the time intervals, TI, are concerned, they require 2208 bits for S samples. Thus, instead of 12512 bits at the SAR ADC output, the LC-ADC can send only 2584 bits. Thus, this LC-ADC with data optimization represents the architecture (A2). In case of (A1) the SAR ADC with DWT compression at BCR equal to 70%, the data length of 12,512 bits becomes equal to 3754 bits. That confirms the SAR ADC output compression's importance of test ECG signals or the use of LC-ADC amplitude output optimization.",

            "text": "Preliminary simulations were done for a single test ECG signal which is the I lead of s0044lre from PTB diagnostic ECG (ptbdb) with all the wavelet subfamilies of MATLAB. Each subfamily is set for wavelet decomposition levels, J , from 2 to 4, and for decomposition matrix dimensions, D \u00d7 D, equal to 64 \u00d7 64. Besides, as the decomposition matrix is invertible and matrix dimensions are required to be a power of 2 to design analysis and synthesis filters, the authors observe preliminary results also for D equal to 128, 256 and 512. On the one hand, lower values of D may not show enough decomposition matrix rows with many zeros to obtain data decompositions in small and high coefficients. On the other hand, increasing dimensions from 64 to 512 has a slight effect on compression ratio and higher values of D show precisely the same results. For the selected ECG signal and for a PRD SAR&DWT upper limit that is equal to 9%, Fig. 9 shows that the BCR SAR&DWT varies between 54.7% and 93.5% for many configurations of D and J . For the test ECG signal, the best wavelet subfamilies are the bior3.3, bior3.5, bior3.7 and bior3.9 with D equal to 512 and J equal to 4. Increasing the wavelet decomposition level, J , leads to a better compression performance, namely from 2 to 3. For example, Table 5 gives the BCR SAR&DWT values for bior3.3 and Haar for J from 2 to 5. These help to observe that J is fixed till third wavelet decomposition level because for higher values of J , performances do not vary significantly. In fact, for bior3.3 wavelet subfamily, BCR SAR&DWT has increased from 75 to 86.72% when J varies from 2 to 3,whereas increasing J from 3 to 4 adds almost 5% to the BCR SAR&DWT , and from 4 to 5 adds only 1.56% to the previous BCR SAR&DWT . The performances in terms of PRD SAR&DWT concerning the number of decomposition matrix rows, K , retained by the OMP are also analyzed for (J , D) equal to (2, 64) , (2, 128) , (3, 64) or (3, 128) for all test ECG signals. For the sake of clarity, these results are not presented in this paper since that requires four figures for each subfamily. As expected, the PRD SAR&DWT increases when the number of selected rows, K , decreases. In fact, the more decomposition matrix rows are discarded from data representation, the more information is lost. In the case of bior3.3 wavelet subfamily, 18.75-28.12% of the decomposition matrix rows are needed for a 9% PRD SAR&DWT for all the test ECG signals depending on the decomposition matrix dimensions and the wavelet decomposition level. Thus, the correspondent BCR SAR&DWT varies from 71.87 to 81.25%. The maximum value of K is equal to 17 and 36 for J equal to 2 in the case of 64 and 128 matrix dimensions, respectively. The minimum value of BCR SAR&DWT is equal to 73.43% and 71.87%, respectively. For J equal to 2 and D equal to 64, at least 26.56% of bior3.3 wavelet coefficients must not be zeroed to recover ECG signals with 9% PRD SAR&DWT or less. This corresponds to a minimum value of BCR SAR&DWT equal to 73.43%. Furthermore, for J equal to 3, the minimum value of K is equal to 8 and 11 for D equal to 64 and 128, respectively. These are promising values for BCR SAR&DWT equal to 87.5% and 91.4% but guarantee a 9% PRD SAR&DWT only for one test ECG signal. To sum up, preliminary simulation results show that bior3.3 wavelet subfamily is not always the best choice to compress the uniformly sampled ECG signals if the 9% PRD SAR&DWT criterion is respected. The best-fit DWT selection results are presented in the next subsection.",

Using the flowchart in Fig. 4 , the number of the most significant coefficients, K , satisfying the 9% PRD SAR&DWT varies according to the wavelet subfamily, J , D and the test ECG signal. Many wavelet subfamilies are not appropriate to the compression of the uniformly sampled ECG signals regarding others, namely the rbio3.1 wavelet. In fact, it presents the highest variation range of K for all decomposition matrix dimensions and wavelet decomposition levels. This choice delivers the lowest variation range of BCR SAR&DWT that was already detected in the preliminary results presented in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 10 (a) , there are some exceptions, known as outliners, that are the values outside the boxplot range between the minimum and maximum values. The outliners are present for subfamilies which median, first quartile and third quartile are identical. Moreover, the range between the maximum and the minimum is proportional to the range between the first and third quartiles. That hence explains the presence of outliners suggesting that some test ECG signals use more or less coefficients than almost all the test ECG signals. For example, db1 selects 17 coefficients and BCR SAR&DWT is equal to 73.43% for almost all the test ECG signals. However, it rarely selects 13, 15 or 16 coefficients to obtain higher bit compression ratios.",

In Table 6 , it is shown that selected subfamilies are similar except for (J , D) equal to (3, 64) . Besides, dimension increase does not importantly affect the compression ratio but requires two times larger number of ECG samples to be compressed. For D equal to 64 and wavelet decomposition level, J , going from 2 to 3 increases 1.5 times the complexity of the analysis tree. In fact, three high-pass (HP) filters and three low-pass (LP) filters are required instead of two HP filters and two LP filters. For example, for bior3.3 subfamily which is the least complex among selected subfamilies for (J , D) equal to (2, 64) , each LP analysis filter has 8 coefficients and each HP analysis filter has 4 coefficients. However, in the biorthogonal family, bior2.2 and bior3.1 subfamilies have the least numbers of filter coefficients. The factorized values of filter coefficients are given in Table 7 . The number of operations to evaluate filter coefficients is the same, but the bior2.2 filter processing requires more processing cycles as it needs 5 cycles instead of 4 for bior3.1. In addition, from an implementation point of view, using those biorthogonal wavelet subfamilies leads to implement multiplier-free filters in the tree-structured filter banks. As the coefficients of such filters are the addition of powers of 2, there is no added quantization error while performing DWT decomposition. The quantization is only used to code \u221a 2 on m bits which is equal to the SAR ADC resolution. Thereby, following the SAR ADC and for all test ECG signals, the best-fit configuration of DWT compression is obtained for bior3.1 subfamily with J equal to 2, D equal to 64, K equal to 17 and thus BCR SAR&DWT equal to 73.43%. To add some margin to PRD SAR&DWT , the optimal value of K , K opt , is fixed at 18. Thus, BCR SAR&DWT is always equal to 71.875% as the chosen value of 18 coefficients out of 64 coefficients is obtained from 64 samples at the SAR ADC output regardless SAR ADC resolution.

Then, since the LC-ADC resolution, M, has already been chosen in [66] , the converter model is only simulated with a resolution equal to 8. This value is typical for ECG amplitude quantization and also ensures good quality signal reconstruction which requires at least 8-bit resolution [67, 68] . The LC-ADC full scale is set to 10 mV.

            "text": "The bit compression ratio of the LC-ADC, BCR LC -ADC , as given in (15), is computed for a p-bit reconstruction resolution and 1 kHz reconstruction frequency. Indeed, the LC-ADC input is an analog signal, the LC-ADC output is a digital compressed data, whereas compression ratio is a digital performance. For a given signal, the BCR LC -ADC values increase when reconstruction resolution, p, varies from 8, 10, 12, 14 to 16. For instance, if p is equal to 16, the reconstruction recovers a 16-bit code every 1 ms independently from their positions in the test ECG signal. Thus, for a given signal, it is obvious that the 16-bit reconstructed LC-ADC output is more performant in terms of bit compression ratio than lower reconstruction resolutions. As far as (A1) is concerned, DWT compresses all the SAR ADC samples including clinically and nonclinically relevant parts in the test ECG signal. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 14 As mentioned in the SAR ADC state of the art, a 10-bit SAR ADC provides an ENOB of 6.63 and a 12-bit SAR ADC provides an ENOB of 11.77. The authors in this subsection are interested only in ENOBs that are equal to 12, 14 and 16. Thus, PRD results are summarized in Fig. 15 where the PRD SAR&DWT results are computed for SAR ADC with the best-fit DWT compression. That is compared to the PRD LC -ADC results according to the reconstruction resolutions, p, which are equal to the selected values of ENOB. In fact, the LC-ADC delivers non-uniform samples and requires linear interpolation to recover p-bit 1 kHz uniformly sampled signal. The recovered signal is used to evaluate the PRD LC -ADC regarding the SAR ADC output for a given value of ENOB equal to p. Figure 15 shows that the LC-ADC almost performs the same as the SAR ADC with DWT compression in terms of PRD. Thus, as this paper aims at optimizing data transmission in order to save data transmission power in RF sensor networks, the authors quantitatively compare data lengths in bits of (A1) the SAR ADC with DWT compression to the ones of (A2) the LC-ADC. Since LC-ADC has non-uniform outputs, the authors need to adopt a same time duration, DT, to compare data length of (A1) to (A2) for all the test ECG signals. If this DT is equal to one second, an m-bit SAR ADC at 1 kHz S/H frequency delivers m kbits during one second of conversion. This amount is reduced to m(1 \u2212 BCR SAR&DWT ) kbits which is due to the reached compression ratio, BCR SAR&DWT , equal to 71.87%. For a 12-bit SAR ADC with DWT compression, this amount is 3.375 kbits. As far as the proposed 8-bit LC-ADC with 12-bit reference counter is concerned, the mean sampling frequency is between 109 Hz and 348 Hz which depends on the test ECG signal.",

In fact, they recover approximately the same ranges of percent root-mean-square differences, PRD SAR&DWT , as the ones of PRD LC -ADC , for different values of ENOB and of linear interpolation resolutions. As far as compression ratio is concerned, (A1) the SAR ADC with DWT compression has a constant value of bit compression ratio,and thus, data length is expected to be reduced before data transmission. However, the LC-ADC and 8-bit linear interpolation deliver a BCR LC -ADC equal to 70.17%, for 75% of the test ECG signals, which is slightly lower than the constant value of compression in (A1). Finally, the drawback of (A1) is that the data length is always constant as the bit compression ratio is constant too. That is considered as a drawback because the data length in bits of (A2) is lower than the data length in bits of: Consequently, if existent SAR ADC-based ECG sensor requires more than 14-bit resolution, the LC-ADC can be perceived as a better architecture to obtain the same signal quality but with lower message data length to transmit to the physician distant control unit.

For instance, in 180 nm CMOS technology, the circuit areas of (A1) and (A2) are approximately equal to 0.45 mm 2 and 0.2 mm 2 , respectively. In fact, SAR ADC area is computed from the mixed-signal chip of [14] , DWT compression area is computed from the signal processing chip of [53] , and estimated LC-ADC area from the layout is already computed in one of the authors' previous work [66] . Thus, in terms of area the LC-ADC is also a promising architecture. As far as the propagation delay is concerned, the authors evaluate the propagation delays of the comparator which is equal to 5 ns and the digital levels' update circuit which is equal to 0.8 ns. Added to that, the DAC's settling time in the 180 nm UMC CMOS technology is estimated to be at most 62 ns. The total delay is at most 68 ns for the LC-ADC. That is in fact lower than the reference counter period equal to 0.1 ms to prevent from the increase in the time offset and hence from harmonic distortion. The LC-ADC requires in its architecture an 8-bit DAC that provides the output 62 ns after the input is injected. Nonetheless, the SAR ADC requires in its architec-ture a 12-bit DAC that provides the output more than 62 ns after the input is injected. Moreover, the DWT compression will also require more propagation delay to deliver the DWT compression output as it is composed of filters, decimators, detection, estimation and level thresholding [53] . Noting that power consumption is equal to 78.8 \u00b5W in case of SAR ADC with two different sampling frequencies and Huffman compression for test ECG signal [14] , whereas it is only equal to 2.42 \u00b5W in case of LC-ADC for test sinewave signal [20] which is not really concluding. In fact, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no other works have been conducted to measure power consumption with test ECG signals.",

In addition, (A2) is also preferable than (A1) covering area, propagation delay and power consumption. Thus, the leaders in design and manufacturing of mixed-signal processing integrated circuits should more investigate on the event-driven ECG sensors. For example, an autonomous wireless sensor node with asynchronous ECG monitoring has been proposed with a 3.8-mm 2 area and 9.7-\u00b5W power consumption in 180 nm CMOS technology [20] but not completely tested with ECG signals yet.",

Then, it reviews the required tools to deal with the quantitative comparative study, namely the SAR ADC architecture, the DWT definition, its parameters and its related compression method. It also explains the performance evaluation test bench of (A1) the SAR ADC with DWT compression architecture. Moreover, (A2) the LC-ADC architecture, the LC-ADC model and performance evaluation test bench are described as well as the evaluation metrics of both compared architectures. Finally, performance evaluation results are discussed to show similarities between the two architectures in terms of signal quality for different configurations. However, the aim is to optimize data transmission and therefore reduce the ECG sensor power consumption of the RF transmission. Accordingly, the proposed 8-bit LC-ADC with 12-bit and 10-kHz reference counter delivers less data than the 14-bit SAR ADC with DWT compression for 82% of the test ECG signals. Consequently, the 16-bit or 14-bit SAR ADC would be replaced by the LC-ADC in the commercialized ECG sensors.",

Meanwhile, SAR ADC results should be improved by the acquisition of ECG signals from existent ECG test devices instead of test ECG signals from Physionet databases. Then, DWT compression can be implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) and tested on the acquisition of ECG signals. Besides, more digital signal processing and lossless compression will be also implemented and tested. In fact, a lossless compression, such as the Huffman coding, can be adopted for the DWT selected coefficients. As far as the LC-ADC is concerned, the authors have to send to the foundry the CMOS circuit design files. An LC-ADC test platform will be achieved in order to test ECG signal acquisition. Afterward, the comparison of (A1) the SAR ADC with DWT compression to (A2) the LC-ADC will be more effective. Following that, a lossless compression, such as the Huffman coding, can be adopted after the LC-ADC to the values that are higher than a given amplitude level and to all time intervals. Future works will also deal with an event-driven ECG device with online ECG features' extraction from the LC-ADC optimized outputs, identification and authentication of patients. Additionally to the LC-ADC, the bradycardia requires the highest value of the reference counter resolution that is equal to 12 bits. Meanwhile, other pathologies require lower values of the reference counter resolution. Consequently, pathologycentric event-driven ECG sensors which are different in terms of LC-ADC's reference counter resolution would be proposed.",
