A. baumannii can develop diverse mechanisms of resistance and so is capable of escaping from the effects of the commonly used antibiotics [2] . It may cause a range of nosocomial infections, including pneumonia, bacteremia, wound infection, and postneurosurgical meningitis, threatening the lives of patients, particularly in the setting of intensive care unit (ICU) [3] .",

After removing the duplicate records between databases, the abstracts of the remaining 262 articles were retrieved for a preliminary screening. Thirty-four studies with full texts were further assessed for eligibility, of which 13 studies were excluded because of insufficient information of carbapenem-resistance, 5 were excluded due to the unavailability of the data of 1month mortality, 4 were excluded because patients were co-infected with other bacteria and 1 study was excluded because patients in control group did not receive active treatments. Finally, a total of 11 studies were included in our meta-analysis. Additional data were obtained from the author of the paper published by Raz-Pasteur and colleagues in 2019 [19] . The data were adequate for comparing colistin with ampicillin-sulbactam and comparing colistin with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole separately in two independent sets of data. Therefore, a total of 12 datasets were analyzed. A flowchart of study selection is shown in Fig. 1 .",

The characteristics of the included studies are listed in Table 1 . These 11 studies consisted of 8 retrospective studies [13, 14, 19, 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] , 2 RCTs [20, 21] and 1 prospective study [23] . The research hospitals are in North America and Europe (USA, Greece, Spain, Turkey, and France), Middle East (Iran, and Israel) and Asia (Taiwan, China, and Thailand). Two studies [25, 26] assessed patients with intracranial infections (such as meningitis). One study [13] reported on patients with intra-abdominal infection. Five studies examined pneumonia [14, [20] [21] [22] 24] , including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Three studies [19, 23, 27] included more than one site of infection. In polymyxins group, colistin was administered in 10 studies [13, 14, 19-24, 26, 27] and polymyxin B [25] was used in only one study. In the control group, carbapenems, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, quinolones, aminoglycosides and glycylcycline (tigecycline) were the most commonly used alternative antibiotics. In 7 studies [13, 14, 19-21, 23, 24] , the intravenous (IV) route of administration was used in both polymyxins and control groups. But in the other 4 studies [22, [25] [26] [27] , patients in polymyxins group received IV and intrathecal/intracerebral (IT) polymyxins or IV and inhaled (IH) polymyxins, while patients in control group were given IV antibiotics only. One-month mortality was reported in all studies, clinical and microbiological response was reported in 5 studies. The length of stay in hospital and adverse events were reported in 4 studies.",

No significant difference was seen between polymyxins based therapies and non-polymyxins based therapies after subgrouping. The pooled ORs of pneumonia, intracranial infection and mixed infection were 1.10 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66), 0.27 (95% CI, 0.02 to 3.35) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.39 to 2.50), respectively. Only one paper reported the intra-abdominal infection caused by CRAB and the OR was 0.72 with 95% CI (0.15 to 3.54) (Fig. 5) . A subgroup analysis was carried out based on route of administration to compare the 1-month mortality between a subset of studies in which antibiotics were given intravenously in both groups and a subset of studies in which polymyxins were given by multiple routes. The pooled OR of studies, in which multiple routes (IV plus IH/IT) were used for polymyxins administration, was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.96). The pooled OR was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.83) in studies that antibiotics were administered intravenously only (Fig. 6 ). This result indicated that lower mortality was associated with the direct delivery of polymyxins to the focus of infection by intrathecal/intracerebral ventricle injection or inhalation. A subgroup analysis was also carried out according to geographical region in order to understand the regional difference of 1-month mortality. Interestingly, the result showed that studies from Middle East region were in favor of non-polymyxin therapies because of lower mortality rate (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.98) (Fig. 7 ).",

            "text": "Infections due to CRAB require special attention. The high morbidity/mortality, the potential to cause outbreaks and the spread of antibiotic resistance are all associated with CRAB infections [3] . Polymyxins are the common options for CRAB infections in clinical practice nowadays. Are polymyxins actually the optimal choice for treating CRAB infections? We aim to answer this question by compiling the up-to-date knowledge on the efficacy and safety of polymyxin-based and nonpolymyxin-base therapies for CRAB infections. The goal of all medical treatments is to improve the overall survival of patients. The all-cause mortality is a measurement of overall survival and an objective endpoint which is not subject to bias. That is why we chose 1-month mortality for any cause as the primary efficacy outcome in this meta-analysis. And one-month followup period is commonly used in hospitals [28] . One-month mortality for any cause was 30.6% in polymyxins group and 42.3% in non-polymyxins group. Our metaanalysis showed that polymyxins based therapies were not associated with lower 1-month mortality when comparing with non-polymyxins based therapies. Many uncertainties are related to 1-month mortality. Especially in our study, 193 patients were in ICU settings with To further comprehend the relative efficacy on a more specific level, clinical and microbiological responses were designed as secondary outcomes. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the performance of polymyxins based therapies (desirable clinical response in 61.7% patients) was better than non-polymyxins based therapies (desirable clinical response in 39.3% patients) in terms of clinical response. The percentage of patients achieving a good microbiological response at the end of treatment was 63.5% in polymyxins group, which was 2 times higher than that in non-polymyxins based group (30.5%). The microbiological response rates favored polymyxins group, but the statistical significance was not reached, probably due to small sample size.",

However, the cases included in their analysis did not share a clear definition of carbapenem resistance. They evaluated the treatments of A. baumannii infections showing different types of drug resistance or no resistance. Given the importance of distinguishing drug resistance in antimicrobial treatments, a clear definition of drug resistance in our study selection could reduce the heterogeneity of meta-analysis. Furthermore, only the studies involving adult patients were included in our analysis, while Liu et al. compiled studies of both adult and pediatric patients. Considering the unique physiological and microbiological conditions of pediatric patients, antimicrobial therapy targeting resistant microorganisms should be discussed in pediatric patients separately.
