Thus, drug repositioning, also known as redirecting, repurposing, and reprofiling [4 , 5] , emerges as an effective possibility for generating new treatments against COVID-19. Repositioning is defined as a new use of a drug, in addition to its original indication(s), and is an option for rapid identification of new therapeutic agents. The availability of drugrelated information, such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity [6] , is an important advantage in the research effort s to quickly find an effective treatment for this deadly virus. Table 1 presents a selection of recent studies that investigated the antiviral activity of several pharmacological classes, including antimalarial drugs and antibiotics, as options for repositioning as treatments of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43) [7] [8] [9] [10] . A search was conducted on three databases (PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science) be- ] with review filters appropriate for individual databases. The inclusion criterion was studies that included the repositioning of drugs with antiviral activity against coronavirus. Duplicate cases were excluded, as were studies that did not address the issue.",

Several authors report the potential of chloroquine as a therapeutic option against this virus: in vitro it presented an EC 50 of 1.13 \u03bcm and in vivo it caused a negative conversion of the virus in more than 100 patients who were participating in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China [7 , 8] . In the in vitro study performed by Liu et al. (2020) , both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibited the virus from entering the cell and, at later cell stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, blocked virus transport between cell organelles, which is considered a determining step for the release of viral genome in cells in the case of SARS-CoV-2. However, chloroquine was observed to have a higher efficacy [9] .",

(-) Not determined Gautret et al. (2020) conducted a clinical trial using hydroxychloroquine in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The initial results show a significant reduction in viral carriage and the use of hydroxychloroquine in conjunction with azithromycin was more efficient in eliminating the virus [11] . There is also expectation for the results of the WHO solidarity initiative, which consisted of a worldwide call for a clinical study to simultaneously research the efficacy of four drugs, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for the treatment of patients affected with COVID-19 [12] . Thus, drug repositioning is a promising alternative for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, and a more complex investigation of the antiviral effect of these molecules against SARS-CoV-2 is encouraged.",
