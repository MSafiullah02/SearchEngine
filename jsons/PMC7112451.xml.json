A special feature is the occurrence of \u201crestricted\u201d trophoblast invasion performed by trophoblast giant cells migrating towards and fusing with maternal epithelial cells [1], [2]. Trophoblast invasion may be compared with tumour invasion but in contrast to tumour cells, the trophoblast can regulate its tumour-like attributes and the depth of invasion is limited in a species-specific manner [3]. In the bovine, this migration takes place between only two cell layers suggesting the bovine placenta to be an ideal model to study invasive processes. So far, the expression of potential regulating factors has been studied on in vivo material only [2], [4], [5].",

Furthermore, the few studies undertaken failed to differentiate between the cell types, epithelial cells in particular [12]. So far only one bovine endometrial (epithelial) cell line (BEND) originating from a non-pregnant animal has been characterised and deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC# CRL-2398) [13]. The BEND cell line has been used successfully in many studies; the majority of which have dealt with prostaglandin synthesis and regulation pathways [14], [15]. However, since it was derived from a non-pregnant animal without differentiating between caruncular and intercaruncular regions, it raises the question as whether it is suitable to study processes occurring during pregnancy. Moreover, the ATCC tested the cells positive for the virus of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), a disease of great importance in bovine medicine and management, since it can lead to a reduced milk yield, decreased fertility and abortion. If transmitted intrauterinely to the fetus within the first 120 days of pregnancy, the calf develops an immune tolerance resulting in persistent infection. Superinfection or mutations within the virus in the first few months after birth result in the development of the lethal mucosal disease [16].",

The cells were proven to be of maternal origin by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). It was demonstrated that these cells expressed the epithelial specific proteins cytokeratin and tight junctional zonula occludens-1 as well as integrin subunits and proteins of the extracellular matrix. Endothelial origin could be excluded by the absence of low density lipoprotein (LDL) labelling. Furthermore, it was shown that cryopreservation of the cells is possible. To standardise future experimental conditions, the aim of this study was to create a cell line, representing a functional, differentiated caruncular epithelium from pregnant cows including the assessment of the BVD virus status. We thereby provide the basis for future research on trophoblast invasion, feto-maternal communication, transport and infection in the bovine placenta.",

Protein samples from a shock frozen placentome and a primary culture containing a pure epithelioid cell population isolated from a caruncle served as controls. Protein extraction, electrophoresis, Western blot and immunodetection with the antibodies listed in Table 1 was performed as previously described [17]. In this study protein derived from primary fibroblasts isolated from the caruncle (negative for cytokeratin) was included as well as the detection of a desmin protein specific band in placentome derived and fibroblast derived protein only. Briefly, protein was extracted with TRIzol-Reagent (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), resuspended in a 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solution, diluted to a final concentration of 1000 \u03bcg/ml protein (\u00b110%) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further processing. Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed with the NuPAGE Gel System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 10% and 12% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gels. Blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 \u03bcm pore size) was followed by immunodetection (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Labs). The colorimetric reaction was induced using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, USA).",

The following three passages were characterised by a low viability of the cells (\nFig. 1) and confluence was hardly reached. By day 14 in culture no further proliferation was observed. Subculturing at this time point stimulated cell proliferation and from passage 12 onwards the proliferation rate accelerated markedly resulting in confluence within 7 days (\u00b11) in culture and remained constant for the subsequent 18 passages. From passage 30 onwards the proliferation rate decreased and because the amount of cryopreserved cultures was deemed sufficient, it was decided to stop further subculturing after the 32nd passage.

It has been described in endometrial cell cultures derived from sheep, pigs, dogs, rats and humans [24], [25], [26], [27], [28].

In comparison, the BEND cell line was successfully subcultured for at least 25 passages [14]. In BCEC-1 the variable and prolonged cultivation periods until confluence during the initial passages are partly referable to the process of spontaneous immortalisation. A similar growth pattern was observed during the establishment of the human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10 [32]. The number of viable and proliferating cells decreased within the first 7 passages and spontaneous immortalisation occurred beyond passage 12. Nonetheless, it should be taken into account that the BCEC-1 cells were not counted prior to each seeding and therefore the number of cells transferred to the new flasks was not identical on each occasion. Thus, the differing periods until confluence was reached could possibly be related to different numbers of cells per passage. Nevertheless, the number of days between two passages remained relatively constant between passages 12 and 30. Later experiments with cryopreserved BCEC-1 cells enabled the defining of an optimal seeding density of 7500 cells/cm2, resulting in a subcultivation ratio of 1:4 and a cultivation period of 6 days until confluence on fibronectin coated flasks. These values corresponded to those suggested by the ATCC for the BEND cell line.",

The positive effect of fibronectin on growth properties of the monolayer was confirmed by the results obtained from cell counting of primary caruncular epithelial cells cultured on different extracellular matrices [34]. Fibronectin is a soluble multiadhesive matrix protein and a major component of the extracellular matrix. Amongst other locations in the bovine placenta, fibronectin is expressed in the basement membrane of the caruncular epithelium [2]. In addition, in primary cultures of caruncular epithelial cells fibronectin secretion was shown to be associated with the expression of specific integrin receptors [18]. Fibronectin secretion is a frequently observed feature of epithelial cell cultures and occurs particularly at the basolateral surface [35], [36]. Taken together these results provide evidence that fibronectin may have a positive effect on the culture conditions of BCEC-1, a procedure which is now used routinely when working with this cell line.",

Bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) is a disease of great importance in bovine medicine and has a worldwide distribution [16]. If transmitted transplacentally to the fetus within the first 120 days of pregnancy, the calf develops an immune tolerance resulting in persistent infection with a non-cytopathogenic (ncp) BVD virus. In the first few months after birth superinfection with ncp-virus or mutations within the virus leading to a transformation into a cytopathogenic (cp) virus, result in the development of the lethal mucosal disease. Immunohistological studies demonstrated strong staining of BVD virus antigen in the caruncular epithelial cells of pregnant persistently infected animals [37]. To date, the pathways of infection in a polarised cell culture model derived from the tissue actually participating in vertical transmission have not yet been studied. In a comparable polarised cell culture model of human bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3) the entry and release of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) almost exclusively from the apical border was demonstrated [38].",
