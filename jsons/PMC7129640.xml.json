            "text": "The universal rules of genetic translation have long been known. However, the present situation is more complex. Firstly, the genetic code is not universal. In several organelles and protists, all genes are decoded by a variant code in which a stop codon reads as a sense codon. Moreover, the genetic code can be locally extended by alteration of standard rules in an individually specific manner for given mRNAs. Such extensions of the genetic code are termed reprogrammed genetic decoding or recoding events. Recoding is determined by particular sequences that force the ribosome to escape standard translation. In vivo, recoding is often in competition with standard decoding and permits the synthesis of an elongated polypeptide. Only a defined proportion of the ribosomes translating a given recoded mRNA actually use reprogrammed genetic decoding. Recoding extends the possibilities of increased diversity in gene expression or regulation.",

Efficient \u22121 frameshifting necessitates specific signals on the mRNA. Basically, the model proposed by Jacks and Varmus identified two components of frameshift signals: a slippery heptamer sequence, X XXY YYZ (the frame of the initiator AUG is indicated by a space), and a downstream structural element, often a pseudoknot or a stem-loop (Jacks et al., 1988). The secondary structure induces a ribosomal pause at the slippery site, and the heptamer sequence allows the slippage of ribosome bound A and P site tRNAs by one nucleotide in the 5\u2032 direction. The pause increases the probability of ribosomal movement in the 5\u2032 direction, although pausing seems necessary, but not sufficient, for stimulation (Kontos et al., 2001). More recently, a new sequence element\u2014the spacer region located between the heptamer and the secondary structure\u2014has been shown to modulate frameshift efficiency both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes Bekaert et al. 2003, Bertrand et al. 2002.",

            "text": "Most \u22121 frameshift events have been reported in viruses and transposons, where they serve in synthesis of replicase activities. This mode of expression allows both a very precise control of the Gag-Pol/Gag ratio and a means of incorporating the enzymes necessary for the replication cycle into the viral particle. Enhancement or reduction of the efficiency of this mechanism can influence virus viability Dinman and Wickner 1992, Shehu-Xhilaga et al. 2001. Very few cellular genes with \u22121 frameshifting are presently known: the dnaX gene of Escherichia coli\n(Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990), the cdd gene of Bacillus subtilis\n(Mejlhede et al., 1999), and the Edr gene of mouse (Shigemoto et al., 2001). Even though the identification of novel genes regulated by \u22121 frameshifting constitutes one of the postgenomic challenges, there is presently no general method to do so (Namy et al., 2004). We recently began a computational approach to model frameshifting sites. The rationale was to observe more elements of the sequence in order to obtain a more precise description of characterized frameshift signals, identify pertinent characteristics, and develop appropriate algorithms. This approach previously allowed us to identify a strong bias in the spacer sequence of eukaryotic viral frameshift signals. This bias was shown to be functionally relevant for the frameshifting mechanism (Bekaert et al., 2003). However, only few frameshift signals have been functionally characterized, although several other sites are suspected to possess such signals from sequence analysis. The original goal of this study was to identify new \u22121 frameshift sites in viruses, so as to enrich our collection of sites in the modeling process. We first quantified frameshifting efficiency directed by 20 viruses carrying a putative or characterized frameshift site. From these results, we were able to develop a sensitive search based on HMM. This algorithm enabled us to detect \u22121 frameshift sites in 74 viruses among the available, fully sequenced viruses. Sequence alignment of these virus sites identified a strong composition bias just upstream of the shifty heptanucleotide site. We demonstrate that the sequence of this region actually affects frameshift efficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These results point to the possible involvement of pseudouridine at position 39 of the tRNA present in the E site of the host cell ribosome in modulating frameshifting efficiency. By using PUS3 yeast mutants lacking \u03a838/39 modifications, we show that frameshifting efficiency is modulated by the modification status of the E site tRNA. Overall, our results propose an extended model for \u22121 frameshift sites.",

For the remaining sites, 13 have been analyzed by extensive directed mutagenesis coupled with quantification of frameshifting efficiency, but the others are only partially characterized.

            "text": "Initially, we functionally characterized a larger number of viruses containing a putative frameshifting site. To explore the widest viral diversity possible (order, family, and genus), we deduced a neighbor-joining tree from the 35 viruses, based on the multiple alignment of the polymerase protein sequence (Figure 1)\n. From this tree, we selected a subset of 20 viruses representative of the global viral diversity. To assay the frameshift competence of each putative site, we cloned the entire viral \u22121 frameshift region of the 20 representative viruses in a dual-reporter vector and estimated in vivo frameshifting efficiency in yeast (see Experimental Procedures). Frameshift sites from different eukaryotic species have been shown to function in yeast Bekaert et al. 2003, Stahl et al. 1995. The existence of a functional frameshift signal was demonstrated for all candidates (Table 1)\nexcept the Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV). It is unlikely that the low level of expression of ScYLV is due to the use of a heterologous host cell, because ten frameshift sites from other plant viruses are functional in our assay. This site might be nonfunctional or carry polymorphic variations. The \u22121 frameshifting frequencies varied between 8% and 31%, compatible with those previously obtained with in vitro or in vivo assays (e.g., EAV 15%\u201320%, den Boon et al. [1991]; BWYV 5%, Kim et al. [1999]; HCV 20%\u201330%, Herold and Siddell [1993]; MMTV 20%, Chamorro et al. [1992]; and RSV 4%, Marczinke et al. [1998]). Although our assay does not provide exact frameshift rates in natural host cells (except for L-A and LB-C viruses, which are natural in S. cerevisiae), these results strongly suggest that most of the frameshift sites identified purely by sequence analysis are in fact functional.",

We checked (1) that the first nucleotide of the heptamer is in frame with the AUG of the upstream coding region, (2) for a protein motif associated to the upstream and downstream coding regions, and (3) for the presence of a potential secondary structure downstream of the heptamer. By this procedure, we identified 74 frameshift sites in viral genomes. Most false positives exhibited no secondary structure after the shifty site and were found in the large and highly complex herpesvirus, papillomavirus, and nucleopolyhedrovirus genomes. We consider this assessment to be accurate, because it depends not only on in silico methods but also on the biological assay of the HMM learning set. It is noteworthy that this method is very efficient, even though we did not take into account the stimulatory secondary structures when we defined the profile. RNA folding algorithms are time consuming and cannot be restrained to a defined window in the vicinity of the heptamer. Moreover, the theoretical evaluation of thermodynamic stability of secondary structures is not accurate for pseudoknots (Walter et al., 1994).",

Within each family, only a few subfamilies/genera were capable of \u22121 frameshifting (see Supplemental Table S1 for details). However, in this latter case, all members of the genus submitted to HMM analyses appear capable of \u22121 frameshifting: they carry not only the HMM profile but also secondary structures as a canonical frameshift signal (Supplemental Table S1). For example, manual checking of the Poleroviruses found by using HMM successfully identifies a pseudoknot three to nine nucleotides downstream from the heptamer site. In the Totiviridae family (dsRNA virus), only the Totivirus genus, represented by the L-A and LB-C viruses (two yeast viruses), has a \u22121 frameshift signal. Moreover, all viruses from the Totivirus and the Giardiavirus genera appear to exhibit such sites. The only exception is the Ustilago maydis virus H1 (Totivirus genus): it shows a perfectly conserved canonical slippery sequence and a strong pseudoknot, despite an in-frame gag-pol gene. This could be due to either a sequencing/annotation error or to an unusual configuration where canonical decoding would be responsible for the synthesis of the Gag-Pol protein, whereas the frameshift would lead to the production of only the Gag domain, reminiscent of the control of the dnaX gene expression in E. coli\n(Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990). Another ambiguous case concerns the Helminthosporium victiriae virus 190S, where previous experimental investigation of gene expression concluded that translation of the second ORF is initiated on its own internal AUG codon (Huang and Ghabrial, 1996). However, this does not exclude the possibility that both mechanisms are at play to express different polypeptides involved in polymerase activity, as observed in some bacterial transposons (Fayet et al., 1990).",

A correlation between the presence of pseudouridine at position 39 (\u03a839) of the tRNA anticodon domain was observed (Table 3): all constructs that exhibited a high-frameshifting level use a cognate (or near-cognate) tRNA carrying the \u03a839 modification. Conversely, the sequences that do not involve a codon decoded by a tRNA with the \u03a839 modification direct low-frameshifting efficiency. This observation prompted us to investigate the effect of the mutation of the PUS3 gene, whose product is specifically responsible for the \u03a839 modification (Lecointe et al., 1998).

However, although the mechanism of frameshifting in eukaryotes is thought to involve mostly tandem slippage of the tRNAs occupying the A and P sites, single slippage at the P site has been reported to occur (Jacks et al., 1988). If this is the case in the experimental system used here, there is no tRNA in the A site at the time of slippage Baranov et al. 2004, Leger et al. 2004. To test the occurrence of single slippage, we used a mutant site in which the UUUAAAC heptamer was mutated to UUUAUAC. In this case, tandem slippage should be inefficient due to the presence of two mismatches after repairing of the A site tRNA in the \u22121 frame, but single slippage would not be affected. The frameshifting efficiency obtained with this construct was <0.1%, similar to the background level. This result demonstrates that in these experiments, frameshifting actually occurred through a tandem tRNA slippage mechanism. This implies that the three sites are involved in ribosomal frameshifting (see below).",

However, each host cell, like the yeast strains used here, carries a specific tRNA pool that differs from one organism to another.

Inconsistency of frameshifting patterns with accepted phylogenetic trees is not surprising taking into account the recombinant nature of many viruses; functional requirements probably account for both this complete conservation and the variability of the frameshifting site sequences. Indeed, in the Retroviridae family, the Alpharetrovirus genus is exceptional because some members exhibit frameshift signals but others do not. In fact, this genus is subdivided in two categories: replication-competent viruses, which possess the pol gene, and defective viruses, which do not. Logically, frameshift signals are found only in the latter category. It is even more interesting that despite their position among the Totiviridae, the Leishmaniavirus genus members do not carry \u22121 frameshift sites but, rather, use +1 frameshifting to express their polymerase domain. This suggests that strong biological constraints are at play in the selection of a recoding event in the life cycle of these viruses, possibly related to the incorporation of the polymerase as a fusion protein in the viral particle.",

This implies that the three ribosomal sites are involved in \u22121 frameshifting. Two hypotheses can be proposed to account for the role of the E site tRNA in frameshifting. Firstly, frameshifting might be enhanced by the absence of a tRNA in the E site. In this case, the \u03a839 modification would destabilize the tRNA:E site interaction. Secondly, \u03a839 might interfere directly or indirectly with the interaction of the P site tRNA with the mRNA, decreasing pairing stability.",

Likewise, in eukaryotes, \u03a839 may induce an unusual E site conformation. If this is the case, one would predict that the \u03a839 modification induces a higher frequency of release of the tRNA from the E site. If E-tRNA normally helps prevent tRNA slippage in the P site, this could explain the different susceptibilities of a given heptamer to slippage. Probably the E-tRNA is released during the accommodation step of the A-tRNA and not during the preceding decoding reaction Nierhaus 1990, Noller et al. 2002. However, in the case of a \u22121 frameshift event, E-tRNA release at the decoding step would facilitate the slippery event of A and P site tRNAs, and this precisely might be the effect of \u03a839. Biochemical experiments will be required to clarify this point.",

The closest distance between the anticodon stem backbones of the P- and E-tRNAs is about 6 \u00c5, which is closer than the distance separating the A- and P-tRNAs. The two tRNAs are not in direct contact but are linked by the 16S rRNA helices H24, H28, and H29, and loops 690 and 790, both of which they directly interact with through their anticodon loops (Yusupov et al., 2001). Another link between E and P sites is through the mRNA. A single possible contact was noted between the mRNA and E-tRNA in the crystal structure, but the latter was noncognate. Even this noncognate E site anticodon was close enough to the codon, such that cognate interaction would be structurally plausible; moreover, there is biochemical evidence for codon-anticodon specificity in the E site Lill and Wintermeyer 1987, Rheinberger et al. 1986. E site tRNA is thus sufficiently connected to the P site to suggest that it very likely plays a role in promoting the stability of P site codon-anticodon pairing. \u03a839 modification can be expected to improperly fill the E site during the slippage-prone state, probably resulting in an unstable P site codon-anticon interaction and enhanced \u22121 frameshifting. This is reminiscent of the role played by a particular context of a bacterial tmRNA resume codon. In this case, an unusual E site conformation destabilizes the P site codon-anticodon interaction and induces frameshifting (Trimble et al., 2004).",

Compared to the initial model of Jacks et al. (1988), sequence elements of both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 heptamer elements are now shown to participate in frameshiting efficiency through interactions between tRNA, mRNA, and the ribosome. Similarly, downstream secondary structures can directly or indirectly influence frameshifting. A combinatorial use of upstream codons, heptamer sequences, downstream codons, and stimulatory secondary structures permit a given frameshifting efficiency for a given virus in a given host. Whether or not these different sequence elements act independently remains to be established.",
