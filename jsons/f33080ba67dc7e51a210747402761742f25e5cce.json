Discussions about the negative role of social media in society generally address the myriad problems wrought by social media, including electoral manipulation, foreign disinformation, trolling, and deepfakes, as unfortunate side effects of a democratizing technology. This article argues that the design of social media fosters information warfare. With its current composition and lack of regulation, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are active agents of disinformation, their destructive force in society outweighing their contributions to democracy. While this is not by deliberate design, the twin forces of capitalism and a lack of regulation of the world's largest social media platforms have led to a situation in which social media are a key component of information war around the globe. This means that scholarly discussions should shift away from questions of ethics or actions (or lack thereof) on the part of social media companies to a frank focus on the security risk posed to democracy by social media.",

The problem with trying to \"balance\" both the benefits of social media such as its challenge to censorship and ability to aggregate social movements against destructive elements such as disinformation and the loss of privacy suggests we can somehow offset one side against the other. But if social media are making a country vulnerable to a key component of modern warfare, that really cannot be \"balanced\" even by the ability of social media to give voice to those often ignored by the mainstream media or to allow citizens to find affinity groups online. It's like saying that we can find a \"balance\" for discussing other national security issues, such as the idea that while an enemy might have superior weapons, at least our nation spent more on social welfare over the past decade. It might be true, but it won't help you win the war when the tanks roll over your borders.",

It is not so much that we need to understand the digital aspect of modern warfare; rather we need to see that digital warfare is a new way of understanding war in the digital age. Digital war is the central, rather than peripheral, issue. According to the Federation of American Scientists, digital war is \"a subset of what we call information war, involves non-physical attacks on information, information processes, and information infrastructure that compromise, alter, damage, disrupt, or destroy information and/or delay, confuse, deceive, and disrupt information processing and decision making.\" 1 One of the most useful frames to consider information war is as the \"fifth dimension\" of warfare, joining land, sea, air, and space as spheres of battle (Franz 1996) . Information war is more precise than the notion of \"cyber war\" (Hunker 2010) . Indeed, the two concepts of \"digital war\" and \"cyber war\" are often conflated, given that \"cyber\" capabilities could be much broader than information operations and could embrace such tactics as dedicated denial of service (DDoS) attacks to bring down servers, the takeover of critical infrastructure via online or local malware, or even drone attacks that are programmed from afar.",

Cutting off access is an obvious act of war that has a clear solution.

Indeed, information operations not only augment, but they often presage or even essentially replace conventional warfare. While the most publicized attack on democracy has been through attempted Russian influence in the U.S. elections, countries in Europe also have uncovered sustained anti-democracy campaigns by Russians in countries ranging from Estonia to the United Kingdom.

A combination of fear, a large degree of unknown about the virus, as well as the rapid shifts in the evolution of the epidemic highlight how quickly disinformation can travel through social media at vulnerable moments. While national governments and major media outlets also are struggling with covering and framing the outbreak, social media platforms allow for authoritarian communication campaigns to widen and deepen the gaps between citizens and countries just when those connections are most desperately needed to combat an international health crisis. An example of this has been the attempt by authoritarian states (including China) to hint or even outright claim that the virus originated in a laboratory in the United States. Now that it is impossible for social media companies to ignore the rising evidence of the central role of social media in inculcating conflict, they have defaulted to two key arguments in their defense: freedom of speech and the idea that the problem is limited to a fundamental misuse of their platforms. A core point emphasized by social media supporters was that the platforms were also vehicles for positive social change, such as in the Arab Spring, although the platforms showed very little ability or desire to adapt their programs to a range of national laws or norms. A 2008 article called \"Doing Just Business or Just Doing Business\" highlighted the problem: If internet companies choose to do business in China, for example, they must abide by China's censorship rules. In the case of the Yahoo! email service, this meant turning over personal information on Hong Kong dissidents (Dann and Haddow 2008) . Dann and Haddow argued that the companies had violated their ethical standards, in that it was reasonable to surmise that turning over the information would have adverse consequences for their users.",

Dann and Haddow describe a world in which the main concerns were about privacy, censorship, and state surveillance, notably whether a country could compel an internet service provider to hand over personal information on its users. There was also disquiet about search engines being compliant with information filtering and collection regimes in non-free states. Social media companies still face these challenges, but they pale in the face of the ability of states to weaponize social media for both domestic and international use. In particular, the way that social media companies organize users into affinity groups (for example, by friending on Facebook or via hashtags on Twitter) makes it remarkably easy to find ways to manipulate these groups. When you add on the way that social media companies sell audiences to advertisers by identifying key markers via user activity (friends, posts, clicks, likes, shares, etc.), you have the ability to manipulate both domestic and foreign audiences as never before. While there has been outrage over Cambridge Analytica, the same capacity to identify and manipulate social media users still lies at the heart of the social media business model.

            "text": "Social media companies would (and do) argue that it's unfair to blame the nature of social media itself if it winds up as the fifth dimension of warfare. Siva Vaidhyanathan disagrees: In his 2018 book Antisocial Media, Vaidhyanathan asserts that the entire design of social media makes it the perfect carrier for disinformation and that social media companies do little to counter this. Indeed, the arguments by Mark Zuckerberg and other social media officials are at best misinformed and, at worst, disingenuous. Given the evidence of the weaponization of social media and the particular lack of foreign citizens to have any right of redress against U.S. companies, 2 it is clear that unregulated and mostly unresponsive dominant media platforms are choosing not to fundamentally change their business model. Indeed, shareholders in Facebook, Twitter, and similar companies would not wish for greater policing of their platforms. The central element of the social media business model is the argument that social media companies are platforms, not providers, of information. This is protected by Section 230 of the U.S. Communication Decency Act, which states that \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" This sounds a little circular but it means that the blame lies with the source of any problematic content, not the platform that provides the content. This has functioned as a get-out-of-jail-free card for Facebook and other internet providers if someone, for example, harasses or bullies or even threatens an individual or group. At the same time, Section 230 has been hailed by internet advocates as protection of free speech, which is true, but also (inadvertently) creates a great opportunity for proponents of disinformation. 3 Section 230 is a very liberal interpretation of U.S. law, which is quite protective of free speech to the point that even hate speech is permissible in the United States. This has created some friction in the United States, but the truly dangerous aspect isn't entirely domestic. It creates opportunities for digital war in two ways. First, it leaves the \"digital borders\" for disinformation more or less open for foreign states (this is aside from the problems of domestic disinformation). At the same time, as Facebook became the dominant social media platform around the world, citizens in other countries find themselves in the same dilemma. While citizens and their leaders discover they need to use the U.S.-based platform in order to communicate and even govern, at the same time social media platforms such as Facebook foster disinformation. They have introduced a communications system with a powerful virus of disinformation. This is exacerbated by the fact that Facebook also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, which carry the same problems. A U.S. freedom of speech model has set up a system through which disinformation flourishes and undermines democracy in countries worldwide.",

On the one hand, better content moderation would make a more pleasant experience for a user seeking to avoid extreme speech, pornography, trolling, or what could be considered culturally inappropriate elements of the public sphere (or inappropriate for a particular age or group). Social media companies do moderate their content to screen out child pornography, extreme violence, etc., although even this is quite difficult. Yet, emotionally charged subject matter drives engagement (Celis et al. 2019 ). This dovetails with the need to attract consumers to the site so that they can be marketed to advertisers. Thus, a quiet, calm public sphere is not the best for their business model. It's true that it would be much more expensive for social media companies to moderate either content or users in a more forceful and efficient way. But as with fake users, outrageous content also helps the bottom line. So it's a lose-lose for social media companies to police their users and their content, as it would be far more costly and actually might reduce engagement. So their reluctance to do so is more than financial or logistical. Moderation works directly against their core economic interests as companies. 7",

However, this is a misconception in a world in which information is deployed into highly engaged, yet highly segregated, communities of voters who are essentially walled off from fact-based journalism and information.

Initially, cars were seen as independent luxury items and there were few rules to govern their use. The early automobile age was accompanied by chaos and a high rate of accidents. Over time, governments took over regulation of the roads and-to a large degree-of car safety through the introduction of seat belts, anti-locking brakes, airbags, and other features. Yet, almost 40,000 Americans die in car accidents every year and tens of thousands more are injured. 8 So Americans do accept tradeoffs. But there has never been a national discussion about the security tradeoffs in social media. What is the level of safety that is necessary? How can we start a national conversation about this?

Prior to 9/11, the idea that U.S. citizens would go through body and luggage searches for all domestic flights would have been laughable. Yet, Americans and visitors now go through searches not only at airports, but in a wide range of other public spaces. While this is framed as a defense against foreign attacks, Americans face significant threats from domestic terrorism. Here is a silver lining to how illuminating the capabilities of social media as a tool for foreign actors to wage disinformation war against U.S. citizens is useful. American democracy also faces significant online domestic threats, from anti-vaxxers to hate groups to disinformation attacks on political opponents. Politically, though, there is no will to frame social media as a key part of that problem; rather, the general narrative is that disinformation is an unfortunate side effect of the social media we cannot live without.",

American perception of conflict and security shifted radically with 9/11. The threat of social media is much less visible and woven not only into the generally opaque nature of social media as people pose, pretend, and market themselves. It also comes at a time when the U.S. government is particularly weak as the political sphere is deeply split over the Trump administration's actions.",

While Russian interference is seen through a strictly partisan lens, Chinese interference creates a much more unified response. Nor have social media executives won themselves much praise for their disingenuous performance at congressional hearings. As the coronavirus pandemic has led to heightened awareness of both the importance and vulnerability of trustworthy information, this could be a watershed moment in understanding and valuing the communication ecosystem. YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki said that the virus had been \"an acceleration of our digital lives\" and noted that it caused the platform to speed up changes to direct users to authoritative information. 10 It is particularly relevant to consider how YouTube addressed health disinformation in the coronavirus pandemic, in that a study by the Oxford Internet Institute found that the platform had emerged as a \"major purveyor of health and wellbeing information\" (Marchal et al. 2020, p. 1) . The Washington Post column that quoted Wojcicki speculated that health disinformation was taken more seriously than political disinformation by social media platforms.",

All it will take is some relatively unified political leadership that can highlight this threat and Americans may indeed be ready for significant changes to the current social media model. Just as Americans pay a security tax for every airline flight, they may be willing to endorse a model of social media that is forced to take responsibility for its users and content. This will likely mean much more stringent government regulation and a change from Section 230. While this is disappointing for liberal concepts of free speech, free speech cannot work in a system in which it is weaponized by foreign adversaries.",
