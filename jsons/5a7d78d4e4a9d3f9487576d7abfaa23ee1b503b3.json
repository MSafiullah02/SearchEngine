Based on the model, we have developed a generic framework for modeling interleaving stems of pseudoknot structures; we propose an algorithm that can efficiently assign stems to components such that interleaving stems are profiled in different components. The components with more stems are associated with higher weights in determining the overall conformation of a sequence segment. In order to efficiently perform alignments of the sequence segment to the model, instead of iteratively aligning the sequence segment to the CM components, our searching algorithm aligns it to each component independently following the descending order of component weights. The statistical log-odds scores are computed based on the structural alignment scores of each CM component. Stem contention may occur such that two or more base pairs obtained from different components require the participation of the same nucleotide. Due to the conformational constraints inherently imposed by the CM components, stem contentions occur infrequently (less than 30%) and can be effectively resolved based on the conformational constraints from the alignment results on components with higher weight values. The algorithm is able to accomplish the search with a worst case time complexity of O((k \u2212 1)W 3 L) and a space complexity of O(kW 2 ), where k is the number of CM components in the model, W and L are the size of the searching window and the length of the genome respectively. We used the model to search for a variety of RNA pseudoknots inserted in randomly generated sequences. Experiments show that the model can achieve excellent sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) on almost all of them, while using only slightly more computation time than searching for pseudoknot-free RNA structures. We then applied the model and the searching algorithm to identify the pseudoknots on the 3' untranslated region in several RNA genomes from the corona virus family. An exact match between the locations found by our program and the real locations is observed. Finally, in order to test the ability of our program to cope with noncoding RNA genes with complex pseudoknot structures, we carried out an experiment where the complete DNA genomes of two bacteria were searched to find the locations of the tmRNA genes. The results show that our program identified the location with a reasonable amount of error (with a right shift of around 20 nucleotide bases) for one bacterial genome and for the other bacteria search was perfect.

The only exception is the srpRNA, where the program misses more than 50% inserted sequence segments in one of the experiments. The relatively lower sensitivity in that particular experiment can be partly ascribed to the fact that the pseudoknot structure of srpRNA contains fewer nucleotides; thus its structural and sequence patterns have a larger probability to occur randomly. The running time for srpRNA, however, is also significantly shorter than that needed by most of other RNA pseudoknots due to the smaller size of the model. Additionally, while the alpha\u2212RBS pseudoknot has a more complex structure and three CM components are needed to model it, our searching algorithm efficiently identifies more than 95% of the inserted pseudoknots with high specificities. A higher C+G concentration in the background does not adversely affect the specificity of the model; it is evident from Table 2 that the program achieves better overall performance in both sensitivity and specificity in a background of higher C+G concentrations.
