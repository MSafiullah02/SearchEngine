Based on lesions observed in newborn mice, coxsackie viruses are classified into two large groups, with 24 coxsackie viruses in group A, and six in group B (2005, 1995). Coxsackie A viruses affect skeletal muscle, while coxsackie B viruses cause pathological changes in several tissues, including the central nervous system, pancreas, liver and brown fat (Hyypia & Stanway, 1993). Coxsackie B viruses are the etiological agents of a wide spectrum of human diseases, including mild respiratory infection, aseptic meningitis, and fatal myocarditis. Outbreaks of coxsackie B virus infection occur annually throughout the world (Patel et al., 2004), and coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) is the most significant pathogen of acute and chronic myocarditis in humans (2001, 2004).",

            "text": "Myocarditis caused by CVB3 experiences three phases. In phase 1, the virus enters and proliferates in the myocardium and subsequently activates the host immune system. In rare cases, if host immune activation continues unabated despite elimination of the virus, T cells may target the host's own tissue through molecular mimicry, initiating phase 2 of the disease. In this stage, cytokine activation and cross\u2010reacting antibodies may further accelerate cardiac damage. The cumulative effect may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, when the disease develops into phase 3 (2001, 1996). In general, it has been considered that antiviral therapy would be most effective in phase 1 of the disease process (Levi & Alejos, 2001; Liu & Mason, 2001). Potentially effective antiviral agents include coxsackie receptor blockers (See & Tilles, 1992), nucleoside analogues (1997, 1988), immunoglobulin (1999, 1997) and interferon (IFN) (Heim et al., 1995).",

On the basis of the result shown in Fig. 1d, we isolated total mRNA from human PBMCs incubated with BW001 for 12 h. At this time point, the anti\u2010CVB3 activity was obviously induced. Using reverse transcriptase (RT)\u2010PCR, the IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03c9 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 mRNAs in the total mRNA were analysed. \u03b2\u2010actin\u2010specific mRNA was used as an internal control. The results showed that the BW001\u2010stimulated human PBMCs expressed mRNAs of IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03c9 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Fig. 2a), and that higher levels of mRNAS of IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 were induced than those of IFN\u2010\u03c9 and IFN\u2010\u03b3. These results imply that the anti\u2010CVB3 activity induced by BW001 may correlate with the expressions of IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03c9 and IFN\u2010\u03b3. There is increasing evidence that IFN\u2010\u03b1 is a major factor in conferring antiviral activity to the human body, and we therefore evaluated the IFN\u2010\u03b1 produced by BW001\u2010stimulated human PBMCs from a number of healthy donors. The PBMCs from six donors were treated with 3 \u03bcg mL\u22121 BW001 or BW002 for 36 h, and the supernatants were then harvested for IFN\u2010\u03b1 detection with an ELISA kit. The results showed that BW001 could induce all six donors' PBMCs to produce IFN\u2010\u03b1, and the levels of IFN\u2010\u03b1 ranged from 80 to 200 pg mL\u22121. The control ODN BW002 did not induce IFN\u2010\u03b1 (Fig. 2b). The data confirm that BW001 can activate human PBMCs to secrete high levels of IFN\u2010\u03b1. To clarify the subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03b1 that are induced by BW001 further, we tried to analyse the mRNA expression profile of 13 subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03b1. Because of the amino acid homology among the subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03b1, it is difficult to distinguish them by antibody\u2010based methods such as ELISA. Furthermore, the absence of introns in the genes of IFN\u2010\u03b1 subtypes and the similarity in the size of genes of IFN\u2010\u03b1 subtypes make it impossible to discriminate the subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03b1 by RT\u2010PCR. To conduct the analysis, total mRNAs were isolated from PBMCs from a healthy donor whose PBMCs were treated with BW001 produced 160 pg mL\u22121 of IFN\u2010\u03b1. The total IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010specific cDNAs were amplified with IFN\u2010\u03b1 consensus primers in a RT\u2010PCR and then were used to construct a cDNA library. The inserts of fifty clones in the library were randomly sequenced. After numerating, we found that the clones carrying IFN\u2010\u03b1 1 and IFN\u2010\u03b1 13 cDNAs comprised 24% of the clones in the library; IFN\u2010\u03b1 2, 14%; IFN\u2010\u03b1 7, 14%; IFN\u2010\u03b1 5, 10%; IFN\u2010\u03b1 16, 10%; IFN\u2010\u03b1 21, 10%; IFN\u2010\u03b1 8, 8%; IFN\u2010\u03b1 4, 4%; IFN\u2010\u03b1 10, 4% and IFN\u2010\u03b1 17, 2%; and that clones positive for IFN\u2010\u03b1 6 and IFN\u2010\u03b1 14 were not detected (Fig. 2c). The data demonstrate that BW001 can stimulate human PBMCs to express at least 11 subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03b1 mRNAs, suggesting that BW001 has the potential to stimulate the production of most subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03b1.",

Experiments in mice have shown that antiviral treatment consisting of IFN, immunoglobulins and nucleoside analogues in the early stages of the disease could limit its development (Levi & Alejos, 2001; Liu & Mason, 2001).

Upon invasion by viruses, the cells of the human body can produce various type I IFNs, including IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03c9, to limit the virus infection. In the human immune system, plasmacytoid dendritic cells expressing Toll\u2010like receptor 9 are responsive target cells of CpG ODN with respect to antiviral reactions (Krug et al., 2001). After the challenge of viruses, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of secreting very large amounts of IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2, at levels up to a thousand times more than are typically produced by most cells (Siegal et al., 1999). The results presented here imply that a significant control of CVB3 infection might be achieved in vivo by the injection of BW001, which will induce type I IFN. IFN has been reported to inhibit the replication of viruses, activate natural killer cells (Pestka et al., 2004), kill virus\u2010infected cells, and facilitate the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that conduct further powerful killing of virus\u2010infected cells.",

            "text": "In humans, there are at least 13 subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03b1 (1980, 2000, 1987). It is generally believed that the transcription of the various IFN\u2010\u03b1 species is modulated through multiple signalling pathways depending on the virus and types of cells infected. It has been found that a distinct virus may induce a characteristic profile of IFN production. For example, Newcastle disease virus preferentially induces the IFN\u2010\u03b1 8 subtype in infected cells (Barnes et al., 2001); hepatitis C virus induces increased IFN\u2010\u03b1 5 in PBMCs, Sendai virus causes human peripheral blood leucocytes to express at least nine IFN\u2010\u03b1 species, including IFN\u2010\u03b1 1, IFN\u2010\u03b1 2, IFN\u2010\u03b1 4, IFN\u2010\u03b1 7, IFN\u2010\u03b1 8, IFN\u2010\u03b1 10, IFN\u2010\u03b1 14, IFN\u2010\u03b1 17 and IFN\u2010\u03b1 21 (Nyman et al., 1998). On the other hand, different IFN\u2010\u03b1 subtypes seem to exhibit different profiles of antiviral activity (Cajean\u2010Feroldi et al., 2004). For example, the antivesicular stomatitis virus effects in vitro are due to the existence of IFN\u2010\u03b1 1, IFN\u2010\u03b1 21, IFN\u2010\u03b1 16, IFN\u2010\u03b1 5, IFN\u2010\u03b1 4, IFN\u2010\u03b1 6, IFN\u2010\u03b1 14, IFN\u2010\u03b1 8, IFN\u2010\u03b1 7, IFN\u2010\u03b1 17 and IFN\u2010\u03b1 10 (Schanen et al., 2006). Recombinant human IFN\u2010\u03b1 1, IFN\u2010\u03b1 2, IFN\u2010\u03b1 5, IFN\u2010\u03b1 8 and IFN\u2010\u03b1 10 could inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus. Among these, IFN\u2010\u03b1 8 was the most and IFN\u2010\u03b1 1 was the least effective (Koyama et al., 2005). Our results that BW001 induced 11 IFN\u2010\u03b1 subtypes from the human IFN\u2010\u03b1 gene portfolio suggest that the anti\u2010CVB3 activity induced by BW001 is correlated with the production of mixed IFN\u2010\u03b1 in a balanced ratio.",

In comparison with the most widely used recombinant IFN, BW001 may have several advantages in the treatment of virus infections. The first is that BW001 induces mixed IFNs, whereas the recombinant IFN currently used is usually a single type of IFN. For instance, recombinant IFN\u2010\u03b1 2b is used to treat hepatitis C, hepatitis B, genital warts, Kaposi's sarcoma, hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, malignant melanoma, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and Erdheim\u2013Chester disease (2005, 2005, 2001, 2005, 2005); and IFN\u2010\u03b2 is used for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (2006, 2006). Obviously, the synergistic action of mixed IFNs is more effective than a single type of IFN. The second advantage is that BW001, with a phosphorothioate backbone, is more resistant to endogenous nucleases and therefore has a longer half\u2010life both in vitro and in vivo (1994, 2002). For comparison, in the human body, the half\u2010life of a regular recombinant IFN\u2010\u03b1 is 3\u20134 h and that of the long\u2010term recombinant IFN\u2010\u03b1 carrying polyethylene glycol is 35 h (Glue et al., 2000). The third advantage is that BW001 induces endogenous IFNs with no immunogenicity in the human body. Repeated use of recombinant IFNs was reported to induce IFN\u2010neutralizing antibodies that will hinder continuous therapy (1990, 1989). It is noteworthy that naturally occurring IFNs have been proved to have a higher antiviral activity than their recombinant counterparts in vitro (2004, 1995).",
