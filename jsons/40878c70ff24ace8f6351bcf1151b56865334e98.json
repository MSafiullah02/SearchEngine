We will 37 search the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We will also search for clinical trial 38 registries, such as clinicaltrial.gov for the ongoing clinical trials. Two investigators (MAZ and 39 SH) will independently screen titles, abstracts, and full-text of included studies based on 40 eligibility criteria. These investigators will also independently extract data and appraise the 41 quality of studies. All potential discrepancies will be resolved through consultation with the 42 third reviewer. Data synthesis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 43 5.3) or CMA (version 2). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard I 2 test. A 44 funnel plot, Egger's test, and Begg's test will be used for asymmetry to explore possible 45 publication bias. 46 Ethics and dissemination 47 The findings of this systematic review with proportional meta-analysis will help to identify the 48 safety and efficacy of Favipiravir for COVID-19 patients.

This systematic review and meta-analysis will be carried out to investigate 141 the world's relevant literature on the safety and effectiveness of Favipiravir in the treatment of 142 COVID-19 patients. Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analog, and potent RdRp inhibitor played 143 an important role in the treatment of influenza and Ebola in recent years 9 . Several drugs such as 144 chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test 145 their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in many countries such as 146 Iran, Japan and China 7, 8 . To date, there is no gold standard for the treatment of COVID-19 as 147evidence is poor 16 . The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will help to 148 evaluate the potential safety and effectiveness of Favipiravir compared to other drugs.
