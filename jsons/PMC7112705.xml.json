During the past decade, bats have been associated with several emerging zoonotic agents including Hendra, Nipah, Lyssa, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like viruses [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Therefore, bats are thought to be an important reservoir for many mammalian viruses. Specifically, numerous viruses have been isolated from the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae\n[6], [7], [8], [9]. While the epizootology of these viruses remains unknown, nucleotide sequences for some flaviviruses have been reported [8], [9], [10]. Yokose virus (YOKV) is a flavivirus that has been isolated from a bat in Japan in 1971. YOKV belongs to the Entebbe bat virus group within the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.",

During this 1971 investigation, YOKV was isolated from the long-fingered bat Miniopterus fuliginosus. Recently, Tajima et al. [11] reported the complete nucleotide sequence of YOKV. Kuno and Chang [9] compared the complete nucleotides sequences with those of other flaviviruses. They concluded that YOKV is genetically closer to yellow fever virus or Sepik virus than JEV, and it is most closely related to Entebbe bat virus.",

Although YOKV is classified into the Entebbe bat virus group of vector unknown group, conserved sequence element 1 (CS1) in the 3\u2032-untranslated region of YOKV is similar to that of mosquito-borne viruses, which are known to display highly conserved CS regions [11], [14]. Therefore, Tajima et al. [11] suggested that YOKV belongs to the mosquito-borne virus group. Moreover, previous reports indicated that Entebbe bat virus can replicate in mosquito cells in vitro [15], and experimental infection of Entebbe bat virus using frugivorous and insectivorous bats showed no viral growth in bats [16]. Since the initial isolation with YOKV in 1971, there have been no additional reports on the isolation or antibody detection of YOKV from bats or mosquitoes. Therefore, to determine whether bats serve as a natural or amplifying host for YOKV, we conducted a serological survey and experimental infection studies in bats with YOKV.",

These results suggest that YOKV is distributed not only in Japan, but also in other Asian countries. The possibility exists that antibodies detected in this survey were against other flaviviruses, since antibodies against flaviviruses have been reported to show high cross-reactivity with other flaviviral antigens [26]. Thus, we conducted an ELISA in which we substituted the JEV antigen to confirm assay specificity. The ELISA using the JEV antigen was found to react with the positive serum against YOKV from the immunized bat; however, the titer against JEV was much lower than the homologous titer using YOKV antigen. We also tested field samples using an ELISA with the JEV antigen, and all samples were negative (data not shown). Moreover, ELISA and NT antibody titers from both field samples and positive sera from immunized bats showed a close correlation.

Thus, to reveal whether bats serve as an amplifying host for YOKV, we conducted an experimental infection study of YOKV in bats and examined viral growth and pathogenicity. Since YOKV was originally isolated from a species of microbat, M. fuliginosus, it would be preferable to conduct experiments on viral characteristics of YOKV not only with fruit bats but also with M. fuliginosus or other microbats. However, maintaining and feeding microbats, especially insectivorous bats, is difficult. Therefore, we conducted our experimental infection studies on the fruit bat R. leschenaultia. Prior to experimental infection, we performed an ELISA to exclude fruit bats that had been previously exposed to (i.e., were positive for) antibodies against YOKV. Fourteen percent of the fruit bats collected from several zoos in the western portion of Japan were positive for YOKV antibodies. These positive sera against YOKV were also tested using an ELISA with the JEV antigen. All samples were negative. Given that Leschenault's rousette bats have been bred in each zoo, and reared separately in open-air cages, it seems likely that these antibody positive bats had been exposed to YOKV at the zoos themselves. Although no accounts of viral isolation or antibody detection of YOKV have been reported since the initial one in 1971, YOKV appears to be present in Japan.",

Moreover, significant viral genome amplification was not detected in any of the samples, except for one liver sample obtained from a virus-inoculated bat killed at day 2 postinoculation. No viral particles were isolated from any of the samples and antibody responses were low. These results reveal that YOKV replicates poorly in Leschenault's rousette bats, and might suggest that fruit bats do not serve as an amplifying host for YOKV. Our results from the serological field survey demonstrate a low prevalence of YOKV in bats from the Philippines and Malaysia, further supporting this suggestion. YOKV may have additional amplifying hosts besides bats, such as mosquitoes. To confirm the viral pathogenicity in microbats and also the relationship between YOKV and mosquitoes, further studies are needed. Although no cases of YOKV infection have been reported in other animals, a single human case of febrile illness, possibly caused by Sepik virus, has been published [29]. Interestingly, Sepik virus exhibits high nucleotide sequence similarities with YOKV. Further studies are necessary to more fully elucidate the pathogenicity of YOKV.",
