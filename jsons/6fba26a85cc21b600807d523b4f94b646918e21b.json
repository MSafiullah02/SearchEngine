In addition, a haploid genetic screen that directly assessed the role of host factors 412 involved in HepS biosynthesis revealed a similar enrichment of genes and also identified 413 EXT1 as the most significant hit (42). Other genes that were enriched in these screens 414 included TM9SF2 and prenyltransferase alpha subunit repeat containing 1 (PTAR1). The 415 involvement of PTAR1 in HepS surface expression has been confirmed recently (20, 21, 27) . 416 TM9SF2 is a member of the highly conserved nonaspanin proteins that have been 417 connected to diverse cellular processes, most notably receptor trafficking, and cellular 418 adhesion (50, 51). In addition, TM9SF2 affects the localization and stability of NDST1, which 419 is critical for N-sulfation of HepS (30). TM9SF2 single nucleotide polymorphisms have been 420 associated with several human diseases, including progression of AIDS(52). This association 421 may, in part, be explained by a TM9SF2-mediated decrease of HepS, thereby affecting 422 binding of HIV to the cell surface (53). 423",

As such, it is suggested to function as a cargo receptor in retrograde vesicular 428 trafficking from the Golgi to the ER (54, 56, 57). In addition, TMED10 localizes to the plasma 429 membrane independently of COPI (58). Plasma membrane-localized TMED10 controls the 430 activity of the presenilin/\u03b3 -secretase complex in neuronal tissue, thereby affecting the 431 formation of amyloid beta peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease (59). Other binding 432 partners have also been described for TMED10, including ER-localized MHC class I (60), and 433 C1 domain-containing proteins such as the chimaerins (61, 62).

Rac1 is deactivated by \u03b22-chimaerin localized at the plasma 439 membrane (61). This localization is regulated by TMED10 that redistributes \u03b22-chimaerin to 440 the perinucleus upon binding (61, 62) Conversely, depletion of TMED10 or disruption of the 441 \u03b22-chimaerin/TMED10 complex relocates \u03b22-chimaerin to the plasma membrane, and 442 thereby enhances Rac1 deactivation (61).

A representative image field of 20 different image fields is presented. Bar size: 7.5 \u00b5m. ",

            "text": "Virus Ankara (MVA). Deep-sequencing analysis of virus-resistant cells identified 29 host factors involved in heparan sulfate synthesis, Golgi organization, and vesicular protein 30 trafficking. We validated EXT1, TM9SF2 and TMED10 (TMP21/p23/p24\u03b4) as important host 31 factors for vaccinia virus infection. The critical role of EXT1 in heparan sulfate synthesis and 32 vaccinia virus infection was confirmed. TM9SF2 was validated as a player mediating heparan 33 sulfate expression, explaining its contribution to vaccinia virus infection. In addition, 34 TMED10 was found to be crucial for virus-induced plasma membrane blebbing and 35 phosphatidylserine-induced macropinocytosis, suggesting that TMED10 regulates actin 36 cytoskeleton remodelling necessary for virus infection. 37 38 Importance 39 Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that can infect a wide range of host species. A number of 40 these viruses are clinically important to humans, including variola virus (smallpox) and 41 vaccinia virus. Since the eradication of smallpox, zoonotic infections with monkeypox virus 42 and cowpox virus are emerging. Additionally, poxviruses can be engineered to specifically 43 target cancer cells, and are used as vaccine vector against tuberculosis, influenzahosts. Poxvirus species capable of infecting humans include variola virus, which 60 causes smallpox and is one of the most destructive pathogens in human history. Since its 61 eradication through successful vaccination using vaccinia virus, poxvirus outbreaks in 62 humans are nowadays mainly caused by zoonotic infections of cowpox virus, monkeypox 63 virus, and recently discovered poxvirus species (1-3). The number of zoonotic infections is 64predicted to rise, due to waning population immunity (4). In part, the decreased immunity is65 caused by concerns about vaccinia virus safety, as a minority of vaccinated individuals show 66 adverse side effects (5). These safety concerns have led to the development of safer, 67 attenuated vaccinia virus strains, including the Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA). By 68 passaging vaccinia virus over 500 times on chicken embryo fibroblasts, the resulting 69 attenuated MVA lost 10% of the parental vaccinia genome, and displays an abortive 70 replication cycle in most cell lines (6). MVA is potent vaccine against poxviruses and serves 71 as a vaccine vector against a variety of other diseases (7-13). 72 Due to their low pathogenicity and wide range of applications, vaccinia virus strains are used 73 as model viruses to study the unique life cycle of poxviruses (14). The vaccinia virus life cycle 74 starts with binding to heparan sulfate (HepS) and other glycosaminoglycans expressed on 75 the host cell, although laminin and unidentified cellular proteins may also play a role (15). 76",

Cells were washed with PBA 170 and incubated with a FITC-labeled His-tag-specific mAb (AD1.1.10; Genxbio) in PBA. Cells 171 were washed twice with PBA and fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry (BD 172 Biosciences) and analyzed by FlowJo (Treestar). 173 174 SDS-PAGE and Western Blot analysis 175 Cells were lysed in 1% Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM 2-(N-176 morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid [MES], 100 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris [pH7.5]) in the presence 177 of 10 mM leupeptin and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride. To remove 178 nuclear fractions, lysates were centrifuged for at 12,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. To prepare 179 samples for SDS-PAGE separation, postnuclear lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer 180 for 10min at 70 \u00b0C. After SDS-PAGE on Bolt 4-12% Bis Tris gels (Life Technologies), proteins 181 were transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer 182 system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with primary mouse antibodies harvested using enzyme-free dissociation buffer and 0.5 x 10 5 cells were 191 incubated with VACV-WR (MOI 20) in ice-cold complete medium. After 1h hour on ice, cells 192 were washed in PBS supplemented with 10% FCS and fixed in PBS supplemented with 4% 193 formaldehyde. Cells were incubated with an H3-specific polyclonal rabbit antibody, washed 194 in PBA and incubated with a PE-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were washed 195 twice and fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry. 196 197 Virus blebbing assay 198 MJS cells (5 x 10 4 /well) were seeded on a Nunc Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide System (Thermo 199 Scientific). The following day, VACV-WR was added (MOI 100), and cells were incubated on 200 ice for 1 h to allow synchronized infection. Cells were subsequently incubated for 45 min at 201 37 \u00b0C, washed and fixed for 10 min at RT using PBS supplemented with 4 % formaldehyde. 202Cells were permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 0.1 % Triton for 10 min at RT, and 203 subsequently incubated for 30 min with PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA. Next, slides were 204 incubated with CytoPainter phalloidin-iFluor 488 (Abcam) to stain actin filaments and TO-205 PRO3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to stain the nuclear DNA. Slides were washed and mounted at the appropriate bandwidth using the 488 nm argon laser for phalloidin and the 210 633 nm helium neon laser for TO-PRO3. Images were processed using the DOPC) or a mixture of DOPC and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS) (Avanti 216 Polar Lipids) in a 7:3 molar ratio. Stock solution of DOPC and DOPS in chloroform (10 mM) 217 were mixed in a glass tube, and chloroform was subsequently evaporated with dry nitrogen 218 gas. The yielded lipid film was subsequently kept in a vacuum desiccator for 20 min. Lipid 219 films were hydrated for 30 min in buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 50mM NaCl (pH 7.4) 220 resulting in total lipid concentration of 10 mM. For calcein-encapsulated LUVs, 50 mM of 221 calcein was added during hydration. The lipid suspensions were freeze-thawed for 10 cycles, 222 at temperatures of -80 and +40\u00b0C, and eventually extruded 10 times through 0.2 \u03bcM-pore 223 size filters (Anotop 10, Whatman, UK). Free calcein was separated from calcein-filled LUVs 224 using size exclusion column chromatography (Sephadex G-50 fine) and eluted with 10 mM 225Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl buffer (pH 7.4). The phospholipid content of lipid stock solutions and 226 vesicle preparations were determined as inorganic phosphate according to Rouser (23). 227Finally, average LUV size of 150-200 nm was confirmed using dynamic light scattering. 40 min in complete medium or medium lacking serum where indicated. Cells were 233 subsequently harvested, and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Cells were fixed in PBS 234 supplemented with 1% formaldehyde, and fluorescent calcein signal was quantified by flow 235 cytometry. For microscopic analysis of LUV uptake, cells were seeded onto a Nunc Lab-Tek II 236Chambered coverglass (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The next day, cells were incubated with 237LUVs and directly imaged in a climate chamber set at 37 \u00b0C using the bright field camera and 238 mercury -vapor lamp of the Leica SP5 confocal microscope. genetic screen identifies host factors for MVA infection 244To identify host factors involved in MVA infection, we performed a genome-wide haploid 245 genetic screen using HAP1 cells, which are readily infected and ultimately killed by MVA. A 246 total of 1 x 10 8 HAP1 cells were mutagenized using a gene trap retrovirus and subsequently 247 infected with MVA. Resistant HAP1 cells were propagated for ten days and their retroviral 248 insertion sites were subsequently identified by deep sequencing to recognize the disrupted 249 genes. Genes that were enriched for disruptive gene trap mutations in the virus selected 250 population but not in uninfected control cells were identified (fig. 1and table S1). Stongest 251 outliers were host factors that directly affect HepS chain formation, including XYLT2, 252 B4GALT7, B3GALT6, B3GAT3, EXTL3, EXT1, EXT2, HS2ST1 ,and NDST1 (reviewed by(24)). 253Other host factors affecting HepS transport and biosynthesis of HepS precursor molecules 254 were also enriched in the screen, including UGDH,UXS1 SLC35B2, and PTAR1 (20, 21,). A second cluster of host factors identified in the screen included all the subunits of the 256 Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. This complex is involved in the distribution of 257 glycosylation enzymes in the Golgi (29), and thereby indirectly affects HepS expression (20). 258 Several other significant hits did not cluster with other genes for functional relationship, and 259 were involved in multiple cellular processes, including protein and vesicle trafficking, 260 ubiquitination, and Golgi organization. 261 262 Validation of hits using the CRISPR/Cas9 system 263 We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to validate the a number of hits, including EXT1, TM9SF2, 264 TMED10, and SACM1L. These genes were selected based on the significance of the 265 enrichment and biological interest. In addition, mindbomb protein 1 (MIB1) was selected as 266 a hit that was already significantly enriched in wild type HAP1 cells (see table S1). Up to five 267 gRNAs per gene were selected and co-expressed with Cas9 in the human melanoma cell line 268 MelJuSo (MJS), which was readily infected by the poxviruses used in this study. In addition, 269 control gRNAs were expressed that target TAP1, TAP2, or B2M, which have no known role in 270 primary poxvirus infection. Cells were infected with MVA at an MOI of 50, and surviving cells 271 were counted seven days post infection. The majority of the wild type MJS cells and cells 272 expressing control gRNAs were susceptible to virus-induced cell death. In contrast, four out 273 of the five gRNAs targeting EXT1 and TM9SF2 conferred robust (\u226550%) protection from 274 MVA-induced cell death (fig. 2). Similarly, five out of the five gRNAs targeting TMED10 275 protected the majority of the cells, although not as pronounced as for gRNAs targeting EXT1 276 or TM9SF2. In contrast, only one gRNA targeting SACM1L and no gRNAs targeting MIB1 277 conferred robust protection against MVA infection. Thus, gRNAs targeting EXT1, TM9SF2, 278 and TMED10 protected cells from virus-induced cell death. 279 280 EXT1 and TM9SF2 affect MVA infection through HepS expression 281 Survival from MVA exposure may be due to resistance to virus-induced cell death, or 282 resistance to primary virus infection. To assess their role in the primary infection event of 283 MVA, anti-EXT1 and anti-TM9SF2 gRNA-expressing cells were cloned and subsequently 284 infected with MVA expressing eGFP from an early/late promoter and monitored for eGFP 285 expression 5h post infection (fig. 3A). Several, but not all, clones expressing EXT1 or TM9SF2 286 gRNAs were highly resistant to MVA infection. Primary infection was reduced more than 287 70% in four out of five EXT1 gRNA clones and more than 60% in four out of eleven TM9SF2 288 gRNA clones (fig. 3A). 289 EXT1 is a crucial player in HepS synthesis by catalyzing the final steps in HepS chain 290 formation. TM9SF2 appeared as a hit in a haploid screen for HepS surface expression (20), 291 and was more recently identified as a crucial factor for N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 292 (NDST1) localization and functioning(30). We tested the effect of the EXT1 and TM9SF2 293 gRNAs on HepS surface expression in the same clones presented in fig. 3a. In the EXT1 294 gRNA-expressing clones that were resistant to primary MVA infection, HepS surface 295 expression was reduced to background levels. In contrast, EXT1 clone 2, which was not 296 resistant to MVA infection, displayed unaltered HepS surface levels (fig. 3B). Similar results 297 were obtained for the TM9SF2 clones, although the downregulation of HepS surface levels 298 was less pronounced as compared to the EXT1 clones. A total of 11 TM9SF2 clones were 299 tested for their resistance to MVA infection and HepS surface expression. These clones 300 displayed varying levels of HepS surface expression, which correlated with MVA infection 301 (fig. 3C). These results confirm a key role for EXT1 and TM9SF2 in HepS surface expression. 302 303 TMED10 is necessary for an early stage of vaccinia virus infection 304 Next, we tested the role of TMED10 in primary MVA infection of HeLa and MJS cells. 305 TMED10 gRNA-expressing HeLa and MJS cells were cloned and tested for TMED10 306 expression by immunoblotting (fig. 4A). Although we could readily knock-out TMED10 from 307 MJS cells, we were not able to establish TMED10-null HeLa cells, suggesting that TMED10 is 308 essential in HeLa but not MJS cells (fig. 4A). In line with this, the TMED10 knockdown clones 309 we could establish in HeLa cells displayed decreased growth rate. In contrast, removing 310 TMED10 from MJS cells did not result in altered morphology or growth rate. 311 The role of TMED10 in primary infection was tested by infecting MJS TMED10 KO clones 312 with two recombinant MVA strains that express eGFP during infection controlled by either 313 an early/late or late promoter. To measure early promoter activity, eGFP expression was 314 evaluated 5h after infection (fig. 4B). In both TMED10 KO clones, infection was reduced 315 modestly but significantly compared to control cells. To test whether TMED10 knockout had 316 an enhanced effect during late stages of infection, cells were infected with MVA expressing 317 eGFP from a late promoter, and eGFP expression was monitored 24h after infection. Late 318 gene expression was affected to similar levels as early gene expression, suggesting that 319 TMED10 affects virus infection prior to early gene expression (fig. 4B). A similar reduction in 320 early and late gene expression was also observed in MJS EXT1 clone 1, thereby confirming 321 that EXT1 affects MVA infection before the onset of early gene expression (fig. 4B). 322 To test the role of TMED10 in infection with other vaccinia virus strains, MJS cells were 323 infected with vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (VACV-WR) expressing eGFP from an 324 early/late promoter (VACV-eGFP). Five hours after inoculation, VACV-eGFP infection was 325 significantly more abrogated as compared to the infection with MVA, and showed a 326 reduction of over 50% when compared to control cells. VACV-WR infection was also highly 327 reduced in MJS EXT1 clone 1, although not as pronounced as for MVA. This is in line with 328 previous reports showing that VACV-WR is less dependent on HepS for attachment than the 329 MVA strain (31, 32)(fig. 4B). Next, we tested the role of TMED10 in VACV-eGFP infection of 330 HeLa cells. Despite the incomplete removal of TMED10 protein from these cells (fig. 4A), 331 VACV-eGFP infection was reduced up to 50% in both HeLa TMED10 knockdown clones at 332 differtent MOIs. In the two MJS TMED10 KO clones, infection was again highly reduced at 333 both MOIs tested (fig. 4C). 334 To exclude that the observed phenotype was caused by off-targeting effects of the two 335 TMED10 gRNAs, the TMED10 cDNA was reintroduced in the MJS TMED10 KO clones by 336 means of lentiviral transduction (fig. 4D). Indeed, TMED10 reconstitution facilitated VACV-337 WR infection to similar levels as control cells (fig. 4E). Thus, we identified TMED10 as a new 338 host factor that affects vaccinia virus infection before the onset of early gene expression. 339 Similar to EXT1 and TM9SF2, TMED10 may affect HepS surface expression and thereby 340 impact attachment of the virus to the host cell membrane. However, both TMED10 KO MJS 341 clones displayed similar HepS surface levels as compared to wt MJS cells (fig. 4F). 342 Furthermore, TMED10 KO had no effect on VACV-WR binding to the host cell membrane, in 343 contrast to EXT1 and TM9SF2 KO cells (fig. 4G). To conclude, TMED10 affects poxvirus 344 infection post attachment but prior early gene expression, suggesting a role during virus 345 entry. 346 347 TMED10 is crucial for membrane blebbing and macropinocytosis 348 The more pronounced effect of TMED10 on VACV-eGFP infection compared to MVA 349 infection may result from the differences in entry pathways that both viruses use. Whereas 350 MVA mainly enters cells by virus-cell fusion at the plasma membrane, VACV predominantly 351 enters the cell through macropinocytotic uptake of virus particles (33). Macropinocytosis of 352 vaccinia is a well-described process that is dependent on the presence of phosphatidylserine 353 (PS) in the viral envelope (34, 35). Interactions between PS and PS receptors are facilitated 354 by serum factors, and induce changes in membrane morphology (36-39). These actin-based 355 changes lead to the formation of giant blebs on the surface of affected cells. Upon 356 retraction of the bleb, virus particles are enclosed in a newly formed macropinosome, which 357 subsequently moves further into the cytoplasm (35). 358 The role of TMED10 in the formation of virus-induced blebs was investigated by incubating 359 control cells and TMED10 KO cells with VACV-WR for 45 min. Subsequently, actin filaments 360 were visualized using confocal microscopy. In control cells, blebbing was readily observed 361 on the surface of virus-exposed cells, whereas blebs were absent in uninfected cells (fig. 5). 362 In contrast, virus-induced blebbing was not observed in TMED10 KO cells, although 363 reintroduction of TMED10 restored blebbing in these cells (fig. 5). 364 The role of TMED10 in macropinocytosis was further demonstrated using large unilamellar 365 membrane vesicles (LUVs). These LUVs are similar in size (150-200 nm in diameter) as 366 vaccinia viruses and can be taken up by cells via macropinocytosis (fig. S1). By introducing 367 the self-quencing fluorescent marker calcein in LUVs, their uptake in cells can be assessed as 368 intracellular LUV release results in the formation of a bright fluorescent signal in the cell (fig. 369 S1). As for VACV, the concentration-dependent uptake of LUVs is dependent on serum 370 factors and PS in the membrane (fig. S1B). In addition, LUV uptake can be blocked by the 371 macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA (fig. S1B). LUV uptake was quantified by flow cytometry in 372 control cells and cells lacking TMED10 (fig. 6). In TMED10 knockdown HeLa cells and 373 TMED10 KO MJS cells LUV uptake was highly reduced, as quantified by flow cytometry (fig. 374 6A). LUV uptake was restored upon reintroduction of TMED10 (fig. 6B). In conclusion, these 375 results indicate that TMED10 affects virus-associated membrane blebbing and the 376 subsequent uptake of virus-like particles through PS-dependent macropinocytosois. represents the first genome-wide haploid genetic screen that aimed to identify 381 host factors important for vaccinia virus infection. The relative absence of host factors 382 identified in this screen at later stages of MVA infection may in part be due to the use of 383 replication-incompetent virus. MVA infection is abrogated in most cell lines due to defects 384 in virus assembly (40). Therefore, host factors involved in later stages of infection are not 385 selected for in a given screen. Screening approaches using replication-competent vaccinia 386 viruses may elucidate more of these factors, although our initial results showed that such 387 viruses are too aggressive and did not allow recovery of virus-resistant cells. Another factor 388 that may contribute to the bias towards host factors affecting early stages of virus infection 389 is the selection method of this screen. This is based on resistance to virus-induced cell 390 death, and thereby does not account for selection of genes mediating virus production and 391 spread. In line with this, a haploid screen using replication-competent RVFV or pseudotyped 392 VSV also recovered host factors mostly involved in virus attachment and entry (clearly illustrates the dominant role of HepS in vaccinia virus infection. This is in 396 line with previous studies showing that attachment of MVA and other vaccinia strains to the 397 host cell is primarily mediated by interactions with HepS on the cell surface (43-46). 398 Although MVA and VACV-WR infection is abrogated in the absence of HepS surface 399 expression, a proportion of the cells can still become infected (see fig. 3A and 4B). It is 400 suggestive that attachment of viruses in the absence of HepS is mediated by other 401 glycosaminoglycans, including chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (47). Other factors 402 including the extracellular matrix protein laminin may also participate in virus 403 attachment(48). In addition, unidentified cell surface receptors have been implicated in 404GAG-independent binding to the cell (15). Although our study did not reveal a specific MVA 405 attachment mediator, the preeminent role of HepS may mask the role for such alternative 406 entry mechanisms. In that respect, additional host factors could be identified by performing 407 a screen on HepS-deficient HAP1 cells. 408The HepS-associated host factors identified in this screen largely overlap with factors 409 identified in haploid genetic screens performed for other viruses that (partly) depend on 410",

            "text": ". Early 79 gene transcripts mediate virus core uncoating and DNA replication (18). Replicated viral 80 genomes serve as template for transcription of intermediate and late genes, many of which 81 are involved in the assembly of virus progeny (18). 82 In contrast to most DNA viruses, poxvirus replication is located outside the cellular nucleus 83 in specialized compartments known as viral factories (14). Due to their independence from 84 the host nucleus, poxviruses are required to encode most of the genes involved in DNA 85 replication and transcription. Consequently, poxviruses are considered to be less dependent 86 on host factors compared to other DNA viruses. Nevertheless, interaction with the host cell 87 are required during most stages of virus infection. Here, we employed a genome-wide 88 haploid genetic screen to identify host factors involved in MVA infection. Deep-sequencing 89 of gene trap insertion sites in the virus-resistant population identified genes involved in 90 HepS biosynthesis, Golgi organization, vesicular protein trafficking and ubiquitination. 91 Besides confirming TM9SF2 as a player in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, we identified 92 TMED10 as a crucial factor for vaccinia virus-induced macropinocytosis. 93 The human melanoma cell line MelJuSo (MJS) and T2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 97 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 2mM L-98 glutamine (complete medium). HEK-293T and Hela cells were cultured in DMEM 99 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 2mM \u029f-100 glutamine. 101 VACV strain Western Reserve (WR) encoding eGFP under control of the early/late P7.5 102 promoter (VACV-eGFP) was a generous gift from Dr. Jon Yewdell (NIH, Bethesda, USA). 103 VACV-eGFP was propagated and titrated on Vero cells. 104 Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing eGFP under the early/late 105 promoter P7.5 (MVA-eGFP) or P11 late promoter (MVA-eGFP late ) was propagated and 106 titrated in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs). All viruses have been amplified, purified 107 (sucrose cushion), and titrated according to standard methodology(19). 108 Mutagenesis of HAP1 cells using a retroviral gene trap vector was performed as described 111 previously (20). For the screen, 1x10 8 cells were infected with MVA-eGFP (MOI 50), and 112 surviving cells were expanded and harvested for genomic DNA isolation. Retroviral insertion 113 sites were amplified using a linear amplification-mediated PCR and deep-sequenced 114 (Illumna HiSeq 2000). Sequences were aligned to the human genome (hg19) to identify 115 retroviral insertion sites, which were assigned to non-overlapping protein-coding Refseq 116 genes. Because the gene trap cassette was designed unidirectionally, genes functioning as 117 MVA host factors would be predicted to be enriched for disruptive orientation insertions 118(21), as tested by a binomial test and corrected for multiple testing (Benjamini and 119Hochberg FDR). Genes already enriched in an unselected wildtype HAP1 dataset (NCBI 120 Sequence Read Archive accession no. SRX1045466) were discarded. 121The selectable lentiviral CRISPR/Cas vector used in this study was previously described(22). 124This vector contains a human codon-optimized S. pyogenes Cas9 gene including a nuclear 125 localization signal (NLS) at the N-and C-terminus. At the N-terminus, Cas9 is fused to PuroR 126 via a T2A ribosome-skipping sequence under control of the human EF1A promoter. 127",
