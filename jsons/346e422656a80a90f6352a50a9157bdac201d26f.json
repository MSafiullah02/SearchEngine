Those with a high MELD score have a greater risk of mortality and thus are given priority to transplantation. Patients with a MELD score of 40 have a 75% chance of death within 3 months. This is particularly important given the transplantation is typically performed on those with high MELD scores in large urban areas such as ours in the greater Los Angeles area.

Most severe or accelerated changes in the level of consciousness are the result of a precipitating event such as a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed and resultant uremia or a new infection. Encephalopathy can be exacerbated by the administration of medications such as benzodiazepines that are generally avoided in the routine treatment of this patient population. Those with low-grade encephalopathy, manifested by mild confusion and tremors, are administered agents such as lactulose to decrease ammonia absorption by acidifying bowel content and increase transit of the bowel contents. Rifaximin is also commonly used to diminish the presence of urease and protease-splitting bacteria. It is important to remember to discontinue lactulose therapy in advance of anticipated liver transplantation to avoid intraoperative diarrhea and possible bowel distention.",

As a result, these patients have hyperdynamic and low systemic vascular resistance cardiac profiles and often require vasopressor therapy-whether oral (e.g., midodrine) or intravenous (e.g., norepinephrine)-to maintain adequate mean arterial pressures (MAP) of >65 mmHg. It is important to consider that hypotension may be multifactorial, resulting from active hemorrhage, infection, and/or systemic inflammatory response (SIRS). Further, cardiac contractile function may be impaired in patients with longstanding cirrhosis or in those with associated ischemic cardiac disease. Routine use of beta blockade as prophylaxis in those with varices may also cause hypotension. If hemor-rhage and SIRS response have been addressed and ruled out, refractory hypotension could be a result of adrenal insufficiency; this is a common pathophysiology in end-stage liver disease patients. There is little additional role for invasive cardiac monitoring in cirrhotic patients for the diagnosis and treatment of shock over echocardiography and other noninvasive means. In general, the treatment of shock does not depart much from that in other patients. Patients should be approached similarly with crystalloid resuscitation and early goal-directed therapy; there is little evidence that albumin should be the resuscitative fluid of choice. Monitoring base deficit and lactate is as prognostic and useful to guide resuscitative efforts in patients with decompensated liver disease as it is for the general ICU population.",

Although noninvasive monitoring is helpful and new modalities are being developed, the most expeditious and accurate modality to differentiate between HPS and PPH is right heart catheterization. HPS, PPH, and CHF can all cause elevated pulmonary artery pressures. However, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) is low in HPS and PPH (and elevated in CHF).

            "text": "There are two subtypes of HRS, types I and II. The first type generally progresses with a rapid decrease in renal function and is characterized with doubling in serum creatinine within that period of time. It may be precipitated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, gastroenteritis with high-volume diarrhea, volume loss from gastrointestinal bleed, or largevolume paracentesis without appropriate volume repletion. Type I HRS can be fatal and often leads to multi-system organ failure. Type II HRS demonstrates a more indolent course of renal failure, often precipitated by ascites refractory to diuretic treatment [1] . HRS develops due to splanchnic circulation vasodilation, intravascular hypovolemia, and renal vasoconstriction and is most often a diagnosis of exclusion after investigating for other causes of renal failure. The treatment approach includes strict intake and output monitoring, serum creatinine monitoring, and following changes from baseline or within the past 48 h. If the patient develops oliguria with elevated serum creatinine greater than 50% from a reference value or baseline serum creatinine level, suspect AKI. Multiple diagnostic variable are used to diagnose HRS in patients with cirrhosis ( Fig. 55.1 ). These patients may require combined liver and renal transplant and/or intraoperative renal replacement therapy to assist with volume status, correcting acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities. The mainstay of treatment for HRS is liver transplantation, after which a majority of patients demonstrate a return to adequate renal function. Consideration should be given to a combined liver/kidney transplantation in those who have required dialysis for greater than 2 months, although this time period is controversial. A variety of approaches can be used to increase intravascular volume and MAP including albumin and vasopressors (norepinephrine, terlipressin). Intermittent paracentesis may be necessary to manage third spacing of fluids in hepatorenal syndrome prior to liver transplant [2, 3] . Type 1 HRS requires multiple therapeutic strategies and therapies; please refer to Fig. 55 .2 for a detailed algorithm.",

In general, patients experience toxic necrosis of the liver on a baseline of normal function, most commonly due to intentional or inadvertent ingestion of large doses of acetaminophen. Thus, the abnormalities noted are lactic acidosis, marked elevation of INR, and high-grade encephalopathy. Ascites and hepatorenal syndrome are often not present given the acuity of presentation. Creatinine, however, is often elevated due to ATN. If time of ingestion is known, and within 8 h, N-acetylcysteine should be administered to prevent further toxicity in acute liver failure patients. If the patient fails medical management with progression of liver failure, liver transplantation will be required. The most significant risk of mortality to a patient with fulminant liver failure is that of cerebral edema and subsequent death from cerebral hernia-tion. Intracranial monitoring remains controversial given severe coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and risk of infection.

Patients who may exhibit transfusion-related lung injury after receiving a significant amount of blood products require ventilation strategies similar to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); in this case, target tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg with supplemental oxygen and positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) [9] . Infections of the lower respiratory tract require broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals until species and sensitivities are established.

However, given the already reduced lean muscle mass of this vulnerable patient population, proteinrestricted diets can worsen hepatic failure. Recommended protein intake is 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day, with a total energy intake of 35-40 kcal/kg/day.

The development of post-liver transplant AKI leads to prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay, increased mortality, and decreased duration of liver graft function [15] . In patients that develop AKI post-liver transplantation, treatment includes the prevention of hypotension and decreased use of unnecessary blood products. The use of renal replacement therapy is reserved for patients that develop significant volume overload, uremia, and electrolyte abnormalities. The most effective treatment of postoperative liver transplant AKI is prevention. Preventive strategies include delayed initiation of calcineurin inhibitors, avoiding nephrotoxic agents such as IV contrast, and ensuring adequate control of hyperglycemia [15] .",

Prolonged and complicated operations, multiple catheter insertions, immunosuppression, and large quantities of fresh frozen plasma can all increase the risk of infectious complications [17] . Diagnosis of infections in this patient population may be difficult due to the lack of signs and symptoms such as fever, chills, cellulitis, and leukocytosis due to an immunosuppressed status. Early postoperative infections in liver transplant patients are typically bacterial and related to the donor's status (previous infections from advanced cirrhosis), the surgical procedure itself, prolonged use of invasive catheters, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Perioperative antibiotics are typically broad spectrum and may include third-generation cephalosporins. Early removal of invasive catheters, early mobility, pulmonary toilet, vigilant monitoring of patient's surgical wounds and drains, and early discharge from the ICU may decrease these infectious complications. Liver transplant patients are at risk of developing opportunistic infections given the initial burst of immunosuppression with high-dose steroid therapy and, as such, should be initiated on prophylactic trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and ganciclovir to prevent cytomegalovirus infection.",

The resulting lack of blood flow and developing ischemia and necrosis from hepatic artery thrombosis present with signs and symptoms similar to fulminant liver failure patients with elevated liver serum tests, coagulopathy, and severe metabolic acidosis. Doppler ultrasound of the hepatic artery and portal vein is routinely employed within the first 24-48 h after liver transplant to diagnose possible vascular complications prior to the development of ischemia and necrosis of the liver transplant graft. These patients are at high risk for continued ischemia and necrosis of the graft with the need for urgent relisting and re-transplantation. Compared to patients with hepatic artery thrombosis, those with portal vein thrombosis do not present with such critical signs and symptoms as a rapid rise in liver function tests and disruption in synthetic function. Although portal vein thrombosis leads to elevation in liver serum tests, signs and symptoms are less dramatic and may consist of mesenteric venous congestion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and the development of ascites. Although these patients may require retransplantation, they can typically be managed with thrombectomy, shunt, or revision of the portal vein anastomosis. Biliary duct complications, which include anastomosis stricture or leak, affect 5-25% of liver transplant patients and are often delayed diagnoses [18] . Thrombosis of the liver transplant hepatic artery can also lead to nonanastomotic stricture [18] . Biliary duct complications can be evaluated with ultrasound of the liver transplant graft looking for biloma and biliary duct dilation. Similarly, internal to external drains placed during the liver transplantation may show biliary drainage during the first several postoperative days. Elevated serum liver tests specifically bilirubin will elevate or fail to appropriately decrease after liver transplant, and the patients may develop signs and symptoms of infection. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be used as a noninvasive diagnostic modality to look for biliary anastomosis complications. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) can be used for the diagnosis of biliary anastomosis leak and stricture, in addition to possible treatment with sphincterotomy and/or biliary stent [19] . Endoscopic treatment is often preferred over percutaneous management of biliary leaks and stricture. Treatment options include endoscopic dilation and stenting and have excellent success rates approaching 75% [20] . Surgical revision of the biliary anastomosis due to stricture or leak may be required in 10-20% of patients [18, 21] . The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for treatment or prophylaxis is recommended due to the high risk of cholangitis and intra-abdominal sepsis [22] . 30-50% of patients with biliary stricture will have to undergo re-transplantation due to chronic biliary cirrhosis due to obstruction even with adequate treatment [19, 22] .",

Primary graft nonfunction occurs in 2-14% of orthotopic liver transplants and typically presents similar to fulminant liver failure with significant metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and lack of bile production [11, 23] . Intraoperative hemodynamic instability, reperfusion injury of the liver transplant graft, marginal livers, and advanced age of donors and recipient are factors that may lead to primary graft nonfunction. Once diagnosed, the only treatment indicated is for relisting and liver re-transplantation. Development of hyperacute rejection (HAR) after liver transplant is a rare complication that may develop intraoperatively or in the immediate postoperative period, which is antibody-mediated and due to ABO crossmatch incompatibility. Patients with HAR typically present with progressive encephalopathy and weakness, elevated bilirubin, severe coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, and shock. Diagnosis is confirmed with Doppler ultrasound that displays portal vein thrombosis and absence of biliary duct stricture. Along with critical care supportive therapy, patients can be managed with plasma exchange for antibody removal and intravenous immunoglobulin [11] . Overall, patients that develop HAR will need immediate relisting and re-transplantation. Acute cellular rejection after liver transplant may occur within the first 6-8 weeks, and the patients are often out of the ICU and no longer critically ill. Patients with acute cellular rejection typically are not critically ill and may present with fever, weakness, and elevated liver function tests. Prior to treating the patients for acute cellular rejection, one must rule out all possible acute infections that could account for the signs and symptoms given that the treatment of acute cellular rejection requires immunosuppression with pulse-dose glucocorticoids and adjustment of other immunosuppression medications.",

Common glucocorticoids used for liver transplant include prednisone, hydrocortisone, and methylprednisolone with the first dose given while in surgery. Intravenous hydrocortisone is typically administered in the immediate postoperative period until the patient is taking enteral nutrition and can transition to oral prednisone. Most patients will undergo a glucocorticoid taper and either transitioned off of glucocorticoids or to a low maintenance dose, typically over a 6-month to 2-year period [24] . Glucocorticoids have a significant number of side effects including poor wound healing, increased infection risks, hyperglycemia, and hypertension; these patients may need judicious adjustment of insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia. Glucocorticoid-free immunosuppression is possible and may be of benefit in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus. [25, 26] Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), including cyclosporine and tacrolimus, are used to prevent and treat acute rejection and liver transplant graft loss. Both provide immunosuppression by inhibiting interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma production and require monitoring of blood levels to reach appropriate therapeutic levels. Potential side effects including altered mental status, seizures, neuropathy, renal failure, electrolyte abnormalities, and others should be monitored for and treated appropriately. Tacrolimus is currently the CNI of choice and has demonstrated superiority in preventing acute rejection and graft loss with decreased mortality [27, 28] . Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare syndrome and side effect of CNI that is diagnosed with clinical exam and CT or MRI. Patients with PRES most commonly present with seizures but may also have symptoms such as headache, delirium, and visual changes. Head CT or MRI typically demonstrates vasogenic edema of the parietal or occipital lobes; however MRI may be more sensitive in diagnosing PRES. Treatment of PRES most often involves discontinuing the offending CNI and supportive care.",
