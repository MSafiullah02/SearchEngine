The rates of urbanization in the north and east have exceeded those in the south and west, respectively. 1 The cities consistently receiving the greatest number of in-migrants are Shenzhen, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, and in fact most east coast cities have experienced large numbers of inmigrants. Among provinces, Guangdong has been a major destination historically while provinces like Yunnan in southwest China have become increasingly important destinations for migrants. Geographic accessibility and cultural relationships have also played a role: Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan and Henan are the major origin provinces of migrants to Guangdong, while neighboring Anhui is the major origin province for migrants to Jiangsu (Figure 2). Projections indicate that a large wave of migration and urbanization can be expected yet again in northeastern China, accompanying major industrial development in this region. The relationship between per capita GDP and urban population share in each province or province-level municipality in 2005-2006. The bubble size repsents the percentage of the province's population whose registered residence (hukou) is not the same location as their current residence.

Path colors indicate the total number of cross-provincial migrants moving between provinces in direction of arrow during the time period. The paths shown accounted for 31%, 50%, 66% and 67% of the total migration that occurred in the four time periods, respectively. Data from Wang, Li et al. 2011.",
