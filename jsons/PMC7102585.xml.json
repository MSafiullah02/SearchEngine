Over a decade, DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4is), which are commonly called gliptins, work as valuable oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through extending the half-life of native incretins (Marguet et al., 2000; Mari et al., 2005). After the first DPP4i, sitagliptin, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults with T2DM in 2006, numerous gliptins, are generated, including saxagliptin, alogliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, teneligliptin, trelagliptin, and omarigliptin.",

Pacheco et al. reported that, in a deaminase activity-independent way, ADA interacts with CD26 on the T cell surface. The complex subsequently anchors to DC surface by an ADA-anchoring protein and then triggers costimulation, leading to an augmented T-cell activation with a Th1 pattern and a marked increase in the production of Th1 proimmflamatory cytokines including interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-6 (Pacheco et al., 2005). On the contrast, CD26 knockout in mice leads to a reduction in Th1 immune responses (Preller et al., 2007) but an up-regulation of Th2-type cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Yan, Gessner, Dietel, Schmiedek, & Fan, 2012).

Phenotypic analysis has revealed that CD26(++)CD4(+) T cells contain more than 90% of Th17 cells (Bengsch et al., 2012). CD26 knockout results in a significant reduction of the Th17 cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-21 in mice with lung transplantation (Yamada et al., 2016). The author assumed that the modulation of Th17 cells by CD26 is via the costimulatory effects on signaling lymphocytic activation (Yamada et al., 2016). However, further investigation on downstream signaling was not performed. IL-6 is important for T cell proliferation and Th17 cells show an IL6-dependent increase (Wang et al., 2018; Winer et al., 2009). We have described that CD26 is correlated with augmented Th1 activation along with a marked increase of Th1 cytokines including IL-6. Pinheiro et al. found that sitagliptin treatment could completely abolish IL-6 expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the stimulation of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) from healthy volunteers and inhibit Th1/Th17 differentiation in vitro (Pinheiro et al., 2017). Thus, we assume that IL-6 may also be involved in CD26-mediated Th17 proliferation.",

In addition, DPP4i significantly increases the Treg expansion in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice (Tian et al., 2010), indicating that DPP4/CD26 inhibition may be responsible for the proliferation of Treg lymphocytes. Martinez-Navio identified that ADA promotes an augmented generation of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) Tregs by a mechanism that seems to be mainly dependent on its enzymatic activity (Martinez-Navio et al., 2011). Accordingly, CD26/ADA/adenosine is considered to exert an important regulatory role in the generation of Tregs.",

Specific suppression of DPP4 activity reduces the B cell activation in a dose-dependent manner (Buhling et al., 1995).

Buhling et al. measured the IgM concentrations from highly purified B cells with different inhibitor concentrations and found a dose-dependent decrease of IgM secretion (Buhling et al., 1995).

DPP4/CD26 may also be involved in the natural cytotoxicity of NK cells, which is verified by the observation that NK cell cytotoxicity against tumour (MADB106) cells is diminished in a DPP4/CD26-deficient F344 rat sub-strain, a model of lung metastasis (Shingu et al., 2003). One of the underlying mechanisms is that tumor target cells can directly adhere to NK cells via CD26. In addition, NK cells can exert their cytotoxicity via secretory lysosomes. Interestingly, DPP4/CD26 has been found on the membrane of secretory lysosomes in NK cells by mean of proteomic analysis (Casey, Meade, & Hewitt, 2007).

It is a chemokine which can attract various progenitor cells, stem cells, leukocytes, neurons, angioblast/endothelial cells, and tumor cells. Thus it is involved in plenty of processes such as angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and tissue repair (e.g., myocardial infarction (MI) and ischeamic stroke) (Bromage, Davidson, & Yellon, 2014; Kubota et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017). CXCL12/SDF-1 acts through the G protein-coupled CXCR4. Proteolytic cleavage of CXCL12 by DPP4 generates CXCL12(3\u201368) and results in a reduced CXCR4 affinity and a loss of its calcium-dependent signaling and chemotactic properties (De La Luz Sierra et al., 2004; Janssens et al., 2017).",

A combination therapy of DPP4i and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) increases circulating levels of GLP-1 and gastrin in acutely diabetic NOD mice, resulting in the restoration of pancreatic insulin content, insulin secretion and normoglycaemia (Suarez-Pinzon, Cembrowski, & Rabinovitch, 2009). Treatment of STZ-induced T1DM mice with DPP4i MK0431 before and after islet transplantation prolongs the survival of islet grafts (Kim et al., 2008). Differently, Kim et al. reported that \u03b2 cell mass is enhanced in NOD mice by the combination of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist and DPP4i, but not by DPP4i or TLR2 agonist alone (Kim et al., 2012).",

Likewise, Griffin and colleagues randomly assigned T1DM participants to receive a combined therapy of oral sitagliptin and a PPI lansoprazole or matched placebo for 12 months; however, the difference of c-peptide between groups is not significant (Griffin, Thompson, Gottschalk, Kyllo, & Rabinovitch, 2014). These two trials estimated that gliptins are incapable of preserving \u03b2 cell mass in autoimmune diabetes. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a special subtype of T1DM. Interestingly, a one-year prospective study conducted in LADA patients demonstrated that a combined treatment of sitagliptin to these patients who receive insulin provides significant improvements in the parameters of islet function (Zhao et al., 2014). Similarly, another DPP4i, linagliptin, contributes to a progressive increase in c-peptide levels in patients with LADA during a 2-year study (Johansen et al., 2014).",

Another point worth noting is that, DPP4 suppression alone may not be able to completely prevent autoimmune attack against \u03b2 cells under overt T1DM condition.

To gain insights into the pathophysiological role of CD26 in arthritis, Busso et al. explored DPP4 expression in experimental mice model of arthritis, murine antigen-induced arthritis (AIA), and found a reduced plasma DPP4 activity in those mice models (Busso et al., 2005). Secretion of CXCL12/SDF-1, the substrate of DPP4, by RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) is crucially involved in the inflammatory process by recruitment of CXCR4-expressing T cells and monocytes from the periphery into the rheumatoid synovium (Seki, Selby, Haupl, & Winchester, 1998). In CD26-deficient mice with AIA, the disease severity is increased due to a lower DPP4 activity in synovial fluids, which results in an increase in SDF-1 levels in those mice (Fig. 1C) (Busso et al., 2005). The major extracellular proteolytic enzymes involved in cartilage resorption are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteases (Proost et al., 2001). Ospelt et al. found that inhibition of serine protease activity of DPP4 promotes invasion of RASFs into cartilage in a mouse model of RA and leads to an increase in SDF-1 levels in concert with its downstream effectors MMP-1 and MMP-3 in vitro (Ospelt et al., 2010). These results indicate a central role of DPP4/SDF-1 signaling in protecting articular cartilage against RASFs invasion.",

In a large cohort of diabetic patients, those initiating DPP4i combination therapy appeared to have a decreased risk of autoimmune diseases including RA (hazard ratio 0.66) compared with those initiating non-DPP4i combination therapy (Kim et al., 2015). Similar result was found in a large population-based cohort study conducted by Seong (Seong, Yee, & Gwak, 2019).

            "text": "Sitagliptin has been found to attenuate the adverse remodeling following MI in Fischer F344 rats with STZ-diabetes (Connelly et al., 2013). Notably, DPP4 inhibition in normoglycemic rodents also significantly improves cardiac function and decreases the infarct size within 5\u20137 days after MI (Hocher, Sharkovska, Mark, Klein, & Pfab, 2013; Kubota et al., 2016). Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from the bone marrow are known to promote vascular repair and neoangiogenesis. Importantly, it has been revealed that inhibition of DPP4 potentially enhances the delivery of EPCs towards injured vascular sites after MI in rats (Hocher et al., 2013), probably due to an increased concentration of SDF-1 (Fig. 2C). A 4-week clinic trial in T2DM patients treated with linagliptin identified a significant increase in EPCs and SDF-1 (Fadini et al., 2010). In addition to EPCs, we have described that SDF-1 could also attract other stem cells through the CXCR4. Zhang et al. reported that the combination of overexpression of CXCR4 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with diprotin A, a DPP4 inhibiter, in rat MI model enhances MSC recruitment and penetration into ischemic myocardium via SDF-1 pathway, leading to the inhibition of myocardial ischemia-induced apoptosis, tissue angiogenesis, and an improvement in heart function after MI (Zhang et al., 2010). Furthermore, the cardioprotective effect is abolished by the pretreatment with a CXCR4 antagonist or a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor in mice with MI, indicating that DPP4 inhibition may have direct protective effects on the post-MI heart through SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated STAT3 signaling pathway (Kubota et al., 2016).

Thus the combination of SGLT2i and DPP4i is used more and more widely in T2DM patients. It is reported that genital mycotic infection is one of the most common adverse effects of SGLT2i (Adimadhyam et al., 2019). Of note, the risk of genital infections with combination therapy of Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin is lower than observed with dapagliflozin alone, suggestive of a protective effect of saxagliptin (Matthaei et al., 2015; Matthaei et al., 2016; Rosenstock et al., 2015), although the potential mechanism is unclear. However, a totally different conclusion is drawn by Min and colleagues. They analyzed 7 RCTs and identified that the risk of genital infection increases (Min, Yoon, Moon, Hahn, & Cho, 2018). We speculate that different combinations of SGLT2is and DPP4is together with the add-on method (simultaneous combination/sequential combination) may contribute to the inconsistent the risk of infections.

Interestingly, sDPP4 is identified as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV through its interaction with the spike protein (Raj et al., 2013). It is known that the sDPP4 level in plasma varies depending on pathophysiological conditions (Lambeir, Durinx, Scharpe, & De Meester, 2003). Inn and colleagues observed that sDPP4 in the plasma of MERS patients is significantly lower than those of normal volunteers. The levels of immune-suppressive cytokine IL-10 and protective growth factor epidermal growth factor (EGF) are significantly negatively and positively correlated with plasma sDPP4 concentration, respectively (Inn et al., 2018). Thus, it is assumed that exogenous sDPP4 may have therapeutic potential in MERS patients and that application of gliptins in MERS patients may adversely affect the pathological and immune processes of this disease.",

The pathogenesis of HCV infection is strongly influenced by the nature of the host's antiviral immunity. It has been described that CXCL10 can be truncated by DPP4 (Table 2). Riva et al. reported that subjects developing chronic hepatitis C have higher concentrations of truncated CXCL10 and DPP4 activity; whereas DPP4 activity progressively decreases over time in patients who spontaneously clears the infection (Riva et al., 2014). A follow-up study was conducted to test the effects of DPP4 inhibition on CXCL10 processing in chronic HCV patients. Participants were treated daily with 100 mg sitagliptin, which results in a significant decrease in truncated CXCL10 but a reciprocal increase in full length form (Decalf et al., 2016). These data provide the direct evidence that therapeutic abrogation of DPP4 activity by gliptins in humans can preserve the bioactive form of CXCL10, suggesting that DPP4i may be a novel strategy to target both the virus and the host (Fig. 3\n).",

Accordingly, it is significant to evaluate the immune and virological safety of DPP4 inhibition in HIV. Dube et al. evaluated inflammation and immune markers during treatment with the sitagliptin among virologically suppressed HIV patients without diabetes. It is found that sitagliptin has no effect on sCD14 levels, a biomarker of monocyte activation (Dube et al., 2019). In addition, there are no differences in any of the immune markers except a significant fall in CXCL10 (Dube et al., 2019). Similar investigation was performed by Goodwin which indicated that, despite lowering SDF-1 levels, sitagliptin does not adversely affect immune or virological status, or increase immune activation in nondiabetic HIV-positive adults (Goodwin et al., 2013).",

Additionally, an accelerated hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or stem cell transplantation is observed in DPP4-deficient mice and, to a lesser extent, pharmacologic inhibition of DPP4 with sitagliptin (Broxmeyer et al., 2012). Among the peripheral blood cells, the recovery of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes is more significant than red blood cells (RBCs) (Broxmeyer et al., 2012). Although there are potential concerns that need to be addressed in clinical trials, treatment with DDP4is holds considerable promise as a new strategy to stimulate hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.

It has been shown that inhibition of DPP4 in F344 rats induces the infiltration of eosinophils into the skin (Fig. 4\n) (Forssmann et al., 2008), which is a typical histopathologic feature of BP. The major BP autoantigen BP180, known as a transmembrane collagen XVII, is responsible of anchoring epidermis into the underlying dermis. Under the condition of BP, anti-BP180 autoantibodies could impair BP180 function, leading to dermal-epidermal separation (Algaissi et al., 2019). It should be noted that DPP4 converts plasminogen to plasmin, which is known to cleave BP180 into 120 and 97 kDa fragments (Hofmann et al., 2009; Nishimura et al., 2016). Accordingly, it is speculated that the suppression of DPP4 may be involved in the disruption of BP180 immunotolerance and the subsequent development of epitopes for BP autoantibodies. Further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms.",

Studies from European and French pharmacovigilance databases were the first epidemiological investigations which identify a high BP incidence in gliptins treated T2DM patients (Bene, et al., 2016; Garcia, Aranburu, Palacios-Zabalza, Lertxundi, & Aguirre, 2016). More recently, Douros et al. conducted a cohort study using the U.K. CPRD among 168,774 patients taking OADs and found that current use of DPP4is doubles the risk of BP, albeit the absolute incidence is low. Moreover, hazard risks gradually increased along with the extension of use, reaching a peak after 20 months' application of gliptins (Douros et al., 2019). Likewise, a similar increase was also observed in a Japanese pharmacovigilance database, particularly among patients treated with vildagliptin, linagliptin, or teneligliptin (Arai, Shirakawa, Konishi, Sagawa, & Terauchi, 2018).",

Accordingly, it is speculated that off-target inhibition on other members of DPP family, such as DPP8 and DPP9 may cause the pathophysiology of gliptin-related BP (Lee et al., 2019). However, patients treated with linagliptin, which is a high selective DPP4i, showed an equal risk of BP as well (Baetta & Corsini, 2011), when compared with vildagliptin (Kridin & Bergman, 2018). Therefore, it is assumed that the DPP4i itself rather than the off-target effect contributes to the high risk of BP suffering.",
