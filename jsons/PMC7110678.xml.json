Hyperoxemia occurred in 30% of patients, while two thirds of these patients received excess oxygen therapy.While a similar proportion of patients were hyperoxemic on day 2 of ARDS, higher FIO2 use did decrease. Consequently, most day 2 hyperoxemia was seen in patients at lower FIO2, in whom gas exchange was improving.In the majority of patients, both hyperoxemia and excess oxygen use were transient, although sustained hyperoxemia occurred in 12% of patients.Higher FIO2 use was independently associated with the risk of hyperoxemia, illustrating the need for close attention to oxygen use to reduce this risk.We found no relationship between the degree and duration of hyperoxemia or of excessive oxygen use, and outcome in early ARDS, in this patient cohort.\n",

Tissue hypoxia is harmful, leading to cell death, organ failure, and increased mortality in the critically ill [2]. While oxygen therapy can reverse tissue hypoxia, little evidence exists regarding the optimal use of oxygen in patients with ARDS. Critically ill patients frequently receive higher inspired oxygen concentrations than necessary [3], perhaps due to concerns regarding tissue hypoxia [4, 5].",

Arterial hyperoxemia has been associated with increased mortality in some older [6\u20138] but not more recent [9, 10] studies of patients with acute brain injury. Hyperoxemia was associated with worse outcomes in cohort patients with acute ischemic stroke or subarachnoid/intracerebral hemorrhage that required invasive mechanical ventilation [11]. Supplemental oxygen therapy worsened myocardial injury and infarct size in patients post myocardial infarction [12]. In patients resuscitated post cardiac arrest, hyperoxia has been associated with harm in several [13\u201316] studies, although the most recent study [17] did not confirm this. Potential mechanisms of oxygen toxicity remain poorly understood and may include systemic arterial vasoconstriction [18, 19], and cytotoxic effects of reactive oxygen species [20\u201322]. In randomized trials, \u201cinduced\u201d hyperoxia (using 100% oxygen) increased 28-day mortality in septic shock patients [23], while critically ill patients randomized to a target arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 70\u2013100 mmHg had lower mortality compared to patients with a \u201cconventional\u201d target of PaO2 up to 150 mmHg [24] in a single-center study. While a recent large international multicenter trial demonstrated no effect of conservative oxygen therapy in a diverse cohort of critically ill patients [25], a subsequent sub-study raised the possibility of clinically important harm with conservative oxygen therapy in patients with sepsis [26].",

            "text": "In ARDS, the relationship between oxygen use and outcome is complex. The severely impaired gas exchange means that high fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) use may simply reflect a more severe alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and hence be a marker of ARDS severity. In mild ARDS, relatively modest levels of FIO2 may result in (moderate) hyperoxemia and tissue hyperoxia. In addition, severe degrees of systemic hyperoxemia (i.e., PaO2 > 300) associated with harm in other critically ill populations are not possible in ARDS. However, even moderate systemic hyperoxemia that may be more commonly seen in ARDS could be harmful [27]. Furthermore, the use of high FIO2 can have direct toxic effects on the lung [28, 29], sensitize the lung to subsequent injury, adversely affect the lung innate immune response [30], and worsen ventilation-induced injury [31\u201333]. These complexities highlight the need to distinguish between hyperoxemia and high FIO2 use. In patients receiving high FIO2, it is important to determine whether this was necessary to achieve normoxemia or if it could have been avoided (i.e., excess oxygen use).",

In detail, patients with sustained hyperoxemia and sustained normoxemia were matched (1:1 match without replacement), using a caliper of 0.2 standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score, and the balance between the matched groups was assessed by the standardized differences of each independent variable used in the propensity score estimation. Statistical significance of the difference in continuous variables, as ventilation-free days and duration of MV, was evaluated with Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while for difference in proportions of deaths, we applied McNemar\u2019s test. Survival probability in these matched groups was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach and assuming that patients discharged alive from hospital before 90 days were alive on day 90. Statistical difference between survival curves was assessed through Kein and Moeschberger test. The same approach was used to assess the possible impact of excess use of oxygen on main outcomes.",

Consequently, clinicians are faced with the task of titrating the amount of oxygen delivered to avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia. Prior studies show that clinicians appear to use higher FIO2 than is necessary in the critically ill [3]. While the reasons are unclear, potential explanations include concerns over the need to avoid tissue hypoxia, [4, 5] a desire to provide a \u201cbuffer\u201d should a clinical deterioration occur, or because the consequences of hyperoxia are considered less severe than hypoxia.",

The fact that hyperoxemia was more prevalent than hypoxemia in patients immediately following the onset of ARDS, might seem surprising given that ARDS is a syndrome defined by impaired gas exchange but presumably reflects the effectiveness of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy. Of interest, hyperoxemia was associated with lower SOFA cardiovascular scores, suggesting that clinicians were not permitting hyperoxemia as a \u201cbuffer\u201d in patients with shock. In this patient cohort, hyperoxemia was relatively transient in the majority of patients in early ARDS.",

However, an important difference between these studies and the current study relates to the severity of hyperoxemia. De Jonge and colleagues reported an association between early hyperoxemia and outcome in patients with acute respiratory failure in the Netherlands [44]. However, this association was only seen in patients with relatively severe hyperoxemia (PaO2 > 123 mmHg; uncommon in our cohort) and only on day 1 of ICU admission, while there was no adverse association between hyperoxia over the entire ICU stay and patient outcome. The potential for harm from hyperoxia in the critically ill appears to be enhanced with greater severity and \u201cdose\u201d of hyperoxemia [45]. In fact, in critically ill patient groups where lung function was relatively preserved, such as patients post cardiac arrest, harm was mainly associated with systemic oxygen tensions over 300 mmHg [13]. Greater degrees of hyperoxemia were likely in both the study by Girardis et al. [24] and in the HYPERS2S trial [23] of \u201cinduced\u201d systemic hyperoxemia in patients with sepsis. Our study was focused solely on patients with ARDS, where due to their impaired gas exchange, they cannot attain this severity of systemic hyperoxia.",

The non-linearity of P/F ratio at different FIO2 [46] makes it difficult to predict the effect of FIO2 on PaO2/FIO2, especially when matching patients with mild ARDS. While we have adjusted our analyses to account for known measured confounders, the possibility remains that some of our findings may arise from unmeasured or residual confounding. Moreover, we cannot make causal inferences for any associations seen, given the observational nature of our study. Our dataset comprises daily arterial blood gas and FIO2 data, taken at a standardized time each morning. It is possible that these data do not properly reflect the spectrum of FIO2 use and PaO2 data over the course of that day. Given this, in the hyperoxemia analyses, we focused on patients that were hyperoxemic on both days 1 and 2 of ARDS. There are no single accepted definitions for hyperoxemia, hypoxemia, or excess oxygen use, so our definitions are of necessity arbitrary, and other definitions have been used in other analyses. This could partly explain any divergence in findings across these studies. Lastly, our assumption that inpatients at day 90 survived to hospital discharge is a further limitation.",
