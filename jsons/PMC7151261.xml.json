But unless all suspected patients and close contacts of confirmed infections were quarantined, transmission among household members will still be an import route of transmission, especially in the areas with more family members. Data about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household contacts is now limited. In the report of Zunyou Wu,10 20 provinces outside of Hubei in China found 1183 case clusters, 64% of the clusters have been within familial households. In another research on SARS-CoV-2 infected cases in Zhejiang province, China, 21 of 62 patients (34%) were associated with familial clusters. And previous works on other two coronavirus caused pneumonia epidemics reported secondary transmission rate among household contacts of 5% for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 10.2% for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).11\n,\n12 Our work showed a secondary transmission rate of 30% among household contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan city, which was similar with the data of Zhejiang province and much more severe than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV did. This is in accordance with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has caused infected cases in ever greater quantities and is spreading in a much higher speed than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.13, 14, 15, 16 Based on the imported cases from Wuhan into other cities, the basic reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68. The epidemic doubling time was estimated to be 6.4 days.17 In this work, as there were only 3.0 \u00b1 1.1 days between the onset of second infection and onset of third infection in households, we prefer to consider the second and third infections in households all as second-generation infections.",

By 29 February, 705 of 3,700 passengers and crew (19%) were tested positive with SARS-CoV-2.18\n,\n19 Notably, this infection rate was achieved after an isolation of 14 days, even though the effect of isolation was partly hindered by the limited space on ship. It confirms that SARS-CoV-2 could spread rapidly among close contacts, which indicates that asking people stay in home is not enough to control the epidemic, and quarantine of suspected cases and close contacts is urgently needed.",

The infection rate of children is much lower when compared with adults in most reports.3\n,\n10\n,\n20 In our work, the infection rate of children was 7%, whereas the infection rate of male adults was 45%. Based on the available evidence, without the results of serological studies, it is hard to tell if children are not susceptible. From the report of Zunyou Wu, the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) of 44 672 confirmed cases in China was 2.3%. Cases in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8.0% CFR and cases in those aged 80 years and older had a 14.8% CFR,10 indicating elder patients with COVID-19 are more likely to die. Compared with community transmission, the transmission among household members is more dangerous for elder people for they tend to stay at home. If they were infected, the mortality rate would increase significantly with age. So, much more attention should be given to the elder family members when deal with SARS-CoV-2.",

As the current estimate of the mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 6.4 days and only 1% of positive cases showed no symptom,10\n,\n20 it is likely that there is less possibility of positive patients in the 51 untested cases.
