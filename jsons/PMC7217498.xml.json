These interactions can be categorized into two main classes [7]. One class corresponds to interactions that are recurrently formed between node pairs, following dyadic relationships that are called strong ties\n[8]. Interactions in the workplace or family ties belong to this class, which forms the backbone of the network [9,10]. The second class encompasses interactions that are based on features of the nodes, which are not attributable to dyadic ties with other nodes. For instance, interactions among people queuing in a line or sitting on a plane belong to this class, whereby interactions are triggered by individual attributes such as extroversion in talking to strangers. These relationships are called weak ties\n[8]. Strong and weak ties concur in shaping the dynamic behavior of complex networks [11\u201313].",

The distribution of this parameter, called activity, can be inferred from real-world data [14].

In this model, temporal connections are wired according to a stochastic rule that encapsulates both the topological information of strong ties and the unstructured connections of weak ties. RADNs share similarities with other approaches to include strong ties in ADNs, such as the superimposition of a static network [25,26], and the inclusion of memory mechanisms in the link wiring process [27,28].",

Therein, the authors have proposed a method to reconstruct the backbone of a temporal network from the direct observation of the pattern of interactions over an accessible time-window. Particularly elusive is the problem of distinguishing strong from weak ties from observations of node dynamics, which is typically the only knowledge available in real epidemiological settings [31].",

The selection of which node to connect to is probabilistically dictated by a row-stochastic [55] matrix P\u2208R\u22650n\u00d7n such that\n(1)P=(1\u2212\u03b3)1n\u22121J+\u03b3diag(d)\u22121G,where \u03b3\u2208[0,1] is a constant parameter and J is the n\u00d7n matrix of all ones, except the diagonal entries, which are set to 0.

(1) accounts for the weak ties, while the second summand models strong ties in the backbone. The parameter \u03b3\u2208[0,1] weights the role of strong versus weak ties in the formation of temporal links.

The orange distribution relates to nodes that share a strong tie and the blue one to the opposite case. The backbone network is a 4-regular random graph. The network is simulated for 35000 time steps. The figure suggests that conditioning on the state of node j affects the infection probability for nodes that share a strong tie with j, confirming our analytical results. The red dotted line is the lower bound on Pj\u2192i in the presence of the strong tie {i,j}, computed using Eq. (4a).",
