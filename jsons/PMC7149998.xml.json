The order includes approximately 290 species divided into five families distributed worldwide (Dyke et al., 2003, Payne, 2000): Phasianidae (e.g., chicken, quail, partridges, pheasants, turkeys, peafowl, and grouse), Odontophoridae (New World quails), Numididae (guineafowl), Cracidae (e.g., chachalacas and curassows), and Megapodiidae (e.g., malleefowl, maleo, and brush-turkeys). Galliformes vary in size from the small king quail that weighs 28\u201340 g to the large North American wild turkey weighing up to 14 kg. Some species have been domesticated and are raised for human consumption of meat and eggs. Grouse, quail, partridges, pheasants, and turkeys are hunted regularly in all parts of the world. The majority of the birds in the group are granivorous to slightly omnivorous.",

Extensive hemorrhage and death can occur if a vaccine or treatment is given by injection in this region, especially when it is engorged (e.g., during hot weather, territorial, or sexual displays). Both sexes share in egg incubation and chick care including secretion of crop milk, a thick fluid composed of desquamated epithelial cells, rich in protein, fat, and immunoglobulins that is regurgitated and fed to the young nestlings for about 2 weeks. Production is stimulated by secretion of prolactin in the pituitary gland. During crop milk production, epithelial cells of the crop are hyperemic, hyperplastic, and hypertrophied. Crop milk can be a source of disease transmission, especially when birds are congregated.",

Rickets caused by calcium and/or vitamin D3 deficiencies is characterized by a thickened zone of proliferation in the growth plate of bones and enlarged parathyroid glands. Similar growth plate changes in the absence of parathyroid gland enlargement are associated with phosphorus deficiency or calcium excess.

Vitamin E deficiency (hypovitaminosis E) develops secondary to consumption of diets low in vitamin E and may be accompanied by deficiency in selenium or sulfur-containing amino acids. Accumulation of peroxides and deficiency of antioxidants results in a spectrum of diseases, which includes encephalomalacia, muscular dystrophy, and exudative diathesis (Swayne et al., 2013). Encephalomalacia also known as \u201ccrazy chick disease\u201d is a disease of the central nervous system in young gallinaceous birds fed diets low in vitamin E; it is more commonly seen in 2\u20134 week old birds (Boulianne et al., 2013). Peroxidative damage to capillary walls results in edema, hemorrhage, and malacia of the affected areas. Macroscopically, the cerebellum is swollen and has petechial to diffuse hemorrhage producing a \u201ccherry red\u201d appearance in more severe lesions (Fig. 31.1\n). Microscopically, there is necrosis of the cerebellar folia that affects all layers, capillary thrombosis, edema, and axonal degeneration and hemorrhage in the cerebellar folia and meninges. Birds with muscular dystrophy have white streaks in muscle fibers of the breast, leg, and gizzard. Microscopically, there is degeneration and necrosis of myofibers, myofiber mineralization, satellite cell proliferation, heterophilic cell infiltrates in acute cases with subsequent fibroplasia. Exudative diathesis is characterized by subcutaneous edema and hemorrhage; a green-blue gelatinous appearance commonly seen in the ventral aspect of the thorax and abdomen and less frequently in the mandible and periorbital region (Brugere-Picoux et al., 2015).",

Deep pectoral myopathy has been reported in zoo white-headed pigeons but not in free-ranging birds (Hill and Miller, 2013). Deep pectoral myopathy can be induced by holding a heavily muscled bird by its legs and allowing it to flap its wings (Siller et al., 1979) or by occlusion of the subclavian artery with muscle stimulation (Wight et al., 1979). Compartmental myopathy produces high levels of lactic acid and myonecrosis. Further complications include lactic acidosis, renal failure, arrhythmias, and death. Initially, the supracoracoid muscle is swollen, pale, and edematous. Later muscle becomes green dry and friable. Histologically, there is necrosis.",

Though more commonly used historically, nonanticoagulant rodenticides (e.g., zinc phosphide or strychnine), can also cause toxicity and should not be ignored. Some species, for example, feral pigeons, may be purposely poisoned if they are considered a nuisance. Presently, there are no nationally registered toxic baits available for use on pigeons in the United States (Woronecki et al., 1992). Common poisons used by private individuals are alpha-Chloralose, 4-aminopyridine (Avitrol), thallium, and ethylene glycol (antifreeze). The first two affect the nervous system.

Karyomegaly may be seen and is due to large, round, and basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies with occasional margination of chromatin. Adenovirus isolation pigeons is difficult, thus diagnosis is by histopathology and identification of 75\u201385 nm diameter, icosahedral, and nonenveloped viral particles by transmission electron microscopy.",

It is common in pigeons in the United States of America, Europe, Australia, South Africa, Japan, and China and is probably distributed worldwide. PiCV causes a complex, multifactorial disease primarily in young pigeons (<4 months of age) called young pigeon disease syndrome; adults can be carriers. PiCV can be found in healthy, asymptomatic pigeons (by PCR or ELISA) and has an incidence of 70% or higher (Stenzel et al., 2012, Swayne et al., 2013). Infection causes immunosuppression due to apoptosis of bursal lymphocytes. Sequela includes severe acquired immunosuppression (Abadie et al., 2001) and various secondary infections. Transmission is primarily horizontal but vertical transmission can also occur. Clinical signs vary and often depend on secondary or concurrent infections. Mortality is variable but can approach 100%. Occasionally, abnormal feathers can also be observed. Gross lesions include an enlarged or small bursa of Fabricius with or without luminal, caseous exudate, and splenomegaly. Microscopically, variable degrees of lymphoid necrosis are seen in the bursa: lymphoid depletion in acute disease and cystic follicles in subacute and chronic disease. Lymphoid depletion can also be seen in the spleen, cecal tonsils, and bone marrow. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic basophilic globular or characteristic botryoid inclusion bodies are present in macrophages and, less commonly, epithelial cells of the bursa of Fabricius (Fig. 31.5\n). Similar inclusions can also be observed in the macrophages of the thymus, spleen, cecal tonsils, lungs, and duodenum. Ultrastructurally, inclusion bodies are composed of 15\u201320 nm in diameter, nonenveloped, icosahedral viral particles that are either loosely arranged or in a paracrystalline array. Diagnosis is based on a combination of PCR (feces or tissues), ELISA, and identification of characteristic inclusion bodies in the bursa of Fabricius and/or other organs, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy.",

Virus infects and replicates in respiratory tract epithelium and conjunctiva. Latency is established in the trigeminal ganglia (Bagust, 1986) and viral infection is reactivated in immunosuppressed birds. In mild cases, the larynx, trachea, and primary bronchi contain excess mucus and have hyperemic mucosa with mild petechiae. In more severe lesions, intraluminal accumulation of fibrinonecrotic material and/or abundant hemorrhage (Fig. 31.6\n), which occludes the laryngeal opening and cause suffocation are seen. Affected birds may also have oculonasal discharge, conjunctivitis, and swelling of the infraorbital sinuses. Microscopic lesions in the respiratory tract and conjunctiva consist of epithelial erosion, necrosis, and ulceration with formation of syncytial cells containing eosinophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies (Fig. 31.7\n). Syncytial cells may be present in tissues or sloughed into lumena and are only evident in the early stages of infection (1\u20135 days) (Guy et al., 1992). The mucosa and submucosa are edematous, congested, and infiltrated by mononuclear cells and heterophils. In addition to the pathologic changes, diagnosis can be made also by virus isolation, immunofluorescence, and PCR for GaHV-1 on samples of larynx, trachea, and lungs (Tripathy and Garcia, 2008).",

The disease is more often seen in unvaccinated and sexually immature chickens that are 2\u20137 months old, but can occur at any age (Boulianne et al., 2013). Virus replicates in feather follicular epithelium and is shed in feather dander. Marek\u2019s disease pathogenesis has four phases (Boodhoo et al., 2016, Swayne et al., 2013). In the early phase, the inhalation of cell-free virus with feather dander infects the respiratory epithelial cell and local macrophages followed by viremia with cytolytic viral replication in lymphocytes. This is followed by a latency phase in CD4+ T cells and results in systemic viral dissemination. During this phase, cutaneous viral infection, replication, and shedding occur. The third phase of MDV is characterized by reactivation in CD4+ T cells. During this phase, a late cytolytic stage and immunosuppression occurs. The final, proliferative phase is characterized by reactivation of the virus and neoplastic transformation of CD4+ T cells.",

Peripheral nerve lesions may be unilateral or bilateral and involve the sciatic, brachial, and vagus nerves and spinal root ganglia. Type A and B lesions are present in peripheral nerves and characterized by an infiltration of neoplastic CD4+ T cells and mixed inflammation with edema, respectively (Burgess et al., 2001, Swayne et al., 2013). Peripheral nerve lesions are rare in quail and turkeys (Paul et al., 1977, Swayne et al., 2013, Witter et al., 1974). Microscopically there is cerebral perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, vasculitis, edema, gliosis, and lymphocytic meningitis. Visceral organs contain pleomorphic and neoplastic T lymphocytes (Fig. 31.9\n). Skin lesions may be inflammatory or neoplastic but usually surround feather follicles. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions may be present in cells of the transitional zone and stratum corneum of the feather follicle epidermis (Fletcher, 2008). Lymphoma can be present in the anterior and posterior uvea. Detection of lymphoma in peripheral nerves, brain, and eye by histopathology support a diagnosis of Marek\u2019s disease.

Virus sources include contaminated environment, food, and water as well as the crop milk, which the adults regurgitate and feed their young. The virus initially infects the mucosa of the conjunctiva, respiratory, and digestive tracts after which the birds develop viremia. Clinical signs include lethargy, depression, excess lacrimation, nasal discharge, diarrhea, neurological signs, and sudden death. Morbidity and mortality are variable in a flock but usually low. Squabs that have maternal immunity are protected against severe disease; they survive but become asymptomatic carriers gel (Marlier and Vindevogel, 2006). Gross lesions include conjunctivitis, fibrinonecrotic exudate in the pharynx, esophagus, and crop and most commonly, hepatomegaly with pale foci of necrosis. The spleen can be enlarged and the pancreas may contain pale, patchy areas of necrosis. Microscopically, there is necrosis of the pharyngeal, esophageal, and ingluvial epithelium with ulceration and inflammation. Epithelial cells subjacent to ulcers often contain eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. The liver contains multifocal to coalescing areas of coagulative necrosis with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies are present in hepatocytes, pancreatic acinar cells, and splenic mononuclear cells. Syncytia, some with inclusions, may also be present. Other lesions described less frequently include stomatitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, sialoadenitis, and proventriculitis. Virus isolation, transmission electron microscopy, or PCR for the viral DNA polymerase gene in liver, chicken egg embryos, chorioallantoic membrane, oropharyngeal swab samples, or cell culture are confirmatory when combined with characteristic histologic lesions (Doufour-Zavala et al., 2008).",

            "text": "\nAvian poxvirus infections are caused by Avipoxviruses in the family of Poxviridae. Within the Avipoxvirus genus are numerous species, including fowlpox, pigeonpox, quailpox, and turkeypox. Infections are reported in a wide host range with a degree of host-specificity; morbidity can approach 100% but mortality is low. Avian pox viruses encode a protein similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF) believed to be associated with epithelial cell hyperplasia in infected tissues (Swayne et al., 2013). Gross lesions of cutaneous avian pox consist of proliferative tan nodules primarily on the unfeathered portions of the head (Fig. 31.10\n) and feet. Nodules may become ulcerated, dark brown, and hemorrhagic as a result of localized trauma. The \u201cwet\u201d or diphtheritic form of avian pox is characterized by proliferative and ulcerative lesions with diphtheritic membranes in the mouth, tongue, esophagus, conjunctiva, and upper respiratory tract (Fig. 31.11\n). Sometimes both forms can occur simultaneously. Characteristic microscopic lesions include irregular acanthosis, spongiosis, and ballooning degeneration with brightly eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions (Bollinger bodies) in epidermal (Fig. 31.12\n), and mucosal epithelial cells. The surface epithelium may be ulcerated and contain secondary bacterial and/or fungal infections. Mononuclear cells are commonly present in the surrounding submucosa or dermis. The microscopic appearance of Bollinger bodies is typically considered as diagnostic, but molecular testing is available. Pox virus infection occurs via ocular, digestive, and respiratory routes by exposure to contaminated environments, food, and water. Mosquito bites aid in the transmission of the virus, which results in breaks in the epidermis that facilitate transmission. The incubation period is between 4 and 10 days and all ages are susceptible. Virus isolation in embryonated chicken egg chorioallantoic membranes, PCR, and electron microscopy (especially in the absence of obvious viral inclusions) (Fig. 31.13\n) support the histologic diagnosis of poxviral infection.",

Wild waterfowl in the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the natural reservoirs (Stallknecht, 1998). Traditionally, AIVs have been classified by their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins. Based on the clinical signs and mortality caused experimentally in chickens, AIVs are classified in two pathotypes, low and highly pathogenic AIV (LPAIV and HPAIV, respectively). For domestic species, all AIVs are reportable to the OIE; for wild birds only HPAIVs are reportable (Bonbon et al., 2017). The same AIV may induce a wide range of clinical signs depending on the host species, age, immunity, etc. LPAIV infections may be subclinical or associated with diseases affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and reproductive tracts. These viruses require trypsin-like enzymes for the cleavage of the HA protein, thus viral replication is usually limited to mucosal epithelial cells of the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Circulation of H5 and H7 subtypes of LPAIV in gallinaceous poultry may result in the acquisition of multiple basic amino acids in the HA protein cleavage site and the emergence of highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) (Suarez, 2008).",

NDV has been detected in at least 241 bird species (Kaleta, 1988). NDV strains are categorized as velogenic (highly virulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), and lentogenic (nonpathogenic). Velogenic strains cause severe nervous and respiratory disease and high mortality (up to 100%); mesogenic strains primarily affect egg production, can produce mild respiratory disease and cause low mortality; lentogenic strains usually are asymptomatic in adult birds, but may cause respiratory disease in the young. Chickens are highly susceptible to velogenic NDV. Pathogenesis of ND involves viral replication in mucosal epithelium of the respiratory and intestinal tracts followed by viremia and viral dissemination to multiple visceral organs and brain. Gross lesions include facial edema, ventricular and/or proventricular hemorrhage, necrosis and hemorrhage in the intestinal mucosa, especially at cecal tonsils and Peyer\u2019s patches, and splenomegaly with congestion and mottling (Swayne et al., 2013). Microscopically, affected birds have nonsuppurative encephalitis with gliosis and neuronal degeneration, disseminated vasculitis and thrombosis, and necrosis in lymphoid tissues as well as necrosis and hemorrhage in the mucosa of the conjunctiva, trachea, and gastrointestinal tract. Infections with low virulence NDV can cause mild conjunctivitis, rhinitis, tracheitis, pneumonia, and airsacculitis (Boulianne et al., 2013). Secondary bacterial infections enhance the severity of the respiratory disease caused by low virulence NDV. Virus isolation, RT-PCR, and DNA sequencing of the fusion protein cleavage site on tracheal and cloacal swabs and samples of affected organs support the gross and histological diagnosis; the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test is performed to determine the virulence of the virus (OIE, 2012, Swayne et al., 2013).",

The etiology of many poultry enteric disease syndromes is difficult to elucidate, as many of these viruses cannot be cultured. Astroviruses, reoviruses, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, and parvoviruses, to mention a few, are implicated as causative agents for enteric disease because they have been isolated from or identified in the intestines and intestinal contents of affected poultry (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008, Swayne et al., 2013).

Chickens, pheasants, and guinea fowl with SHS may present with swelling of the infraorbital sinuses, periorbital region, eyelid and subcutaneous tissue of the mandible, neck, and wattles due to accumulations of yellow gelatinous to caseous material. Turkeys with TRT have watery to mucoid exudate in the nasal passages and trachea (Jones et al., 1988) and periorbital and infraorbital edema. Fibrinous polyserositis with airsacculitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis, salpingitis, and oophoritis occur in birds with secondary bacterial infections. Microscopically, there is a loss of epithelial cilia in the respiratory tract and the lamina propria is expanded with edema and inflammatory cells. Small eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions may be seen in epithelium of the nasal turbinates and trachea in the acute stage of the disease (Brugere-Picoux et al., 2015). Conjunctivitis, osteomyelitis of cranial bones, and otitis may also occur.

Lesions are due to viremia and noted in various organs including the brain, inner ear, and viscera. Clinical signs include anorexia, greenish watery diarrhea, lethargy, depression, and most commonly neurological signs, such as ataxia, paralysis of legs and wings, torticollis, and opisthotonus (Fig. 31.14\n). Morbidity can be high, but mortality in a flock is low. Gross lesions include greenish watery intestinal contents, pale tan and enlarged kidneys with increased urates, enlarged and mottled pale tan or red pancreas, and splenomegaly.

Pathogenesis involves infection of the intestinal epithelium followed by viremia and viral dissemination to other visceral organs, skeletal muscle, and the brain (Swayne et al., 2013). Pale discoloration in the muscular layers of the ventriculus may be the only gross lesion seen in birds with clinical disease or gross lesions may be absent; grayish foci may be seen in the pancreas of pigeons (Toplu and Alcigir, 2004). Cataracts may be observed in birds that survive infection. Microscopically, the brain and spinal cord usually contain encephalomyelitis with lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, gliosis, glial nodules, central chromatolysis of neuronal cell bodies, and neuronal satellitosis. Multifocal lymphocytic infiltration may be present in the myocardium, muscular layer of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves (Brugere-Picoux et al., 2015, Swayne et al., 2013). Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs, disseminated nonpurulent inflammation of the central nervous system, and identification of characteristic central chromatolysis in neuronal cell bodies in the brain stem (Fig. 31.15\n).

            "text": "\nLymphoid leukosis (LL) is a disease of semimature to mature chickens caused by avian leukosis sarcoma viruses (ALVs). These viruses are classified into 10 subgroups: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J. ALVs may cause a variety of tumors including lymphoid leukosis, soft tissue sarcomas, epithelial cell tumors (primarily renal tumors), and tumors of endothelial cell origin (hemangioma and hemangiosarcoma among others) (Swayne et al., 2013). Lymphoid leukosis is the most common of these neoplastic conditions. Disease is more frequently seen in chickens older than 16 weeks. ALVs infect and replicate in various tissues, but the bursa of Fabricius is the target organ for neoplastic transformation in chickens with LL. ALVs cause insertional activation of c-myc in transformed follicles by placing this gene under the control of viral LTR, which causes maturation arrest and proliferation of bursal stem cells (Neiman et al., 2001, Neiman et al., 2006). Gross lesions of LL consist of splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and grayish to white soft tumors in various organs but most commonly in liver, spleen and bursa of Fabricius. Microscopically, affected organs have multifocal to coalescing nodules containing a uniform population of large lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) that efface normal tissue architecture and compress adjacent parenchyma. Lymphoma in the bursa of Fabricius has an intrafollicular growth pattern. Diagnosis can be difficult because LL tumors are similar to those caused by Marek\u2019s disease virus and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) (Boulianne et al., 2013). Lymphoma with an intrafollicular pattern in the bursa of Fabricius is typical for LL, but bursal lymphoma caused by REV needs to be ruled out. Immunohistochemistry for B-cell and IgM surface markers, virus isolation from peripheral white blood cells and tumor homogenates, and standard or quantitative RT-PCR can be used for confirmation. Because ALVs are ubiquitous, viral detection alone is not confirmatory.",

Epidemiological surveys classify pigeons from moderately susceptible to highly resistant to M. avium (Dhama et al., 2011, Dvorska et al., 2007, U.S. Geological Survey, 1990). In the past, Mycobacteriosis caused by M. genavense has been reported in captive doves (Haridy et al., 2014, Saggese et al., 2008). Contaminated fecal material is the most important means of dissemination of M. avium. Respiratory tract is also a potential source of infection. The bacteria can survive for more than 4 years in the environment, when not under direct sunlight (Dvorska et al., 2007). Infected birds lose weight, their feathers look dull, and birds have a marked leukocytosis due to monocytosis. Abnormal gait or paralysis can occur with joint infection. The most frequent gross lesions are individual or coalescing, granulomas that vary from pinpoint to several centimeters and can be found in many tissues including the liver, spleen, intestine, lung, and bone marrow. Histologically, lesions vary from mild to severe and consist of multifocal granulomatous inflammation or organized granulomas that, in some cases, replace significant portions of parenchymal organs; multifocal caseous necrosis is also seen. Granulomas are characterized by large accumulations of macrophages with abundant cytoplasm surrounded by multinucleated giant cells and fibrosis. Acid fast stains (e.g., Ziehl-Neelsen) highlight large numbers of bacteria within the cytoplasm of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. These findings are usually sufficient for diagnosis. Other bacterial conditions, such as coligranuloma, Salmonella infections, fowl cholera, etc. must be ruled out as differentials. Mycobacterium can be cultured in suitable media and the species can be identified by PCR and sequencing.",

Young birds are most susceptible and adults can be carriers. Chlamydiosis, on the other hand, is rarely detected in galliforms (Kaleta and Taday, 2003). Turkeys are the most common species affected (Andersen, 2005). One report from China, demonstrates that C. gallinacean, not C. psittaci, is common in clinically healthy chickens (Guo et al., 2016). The disease characteristics, transmission, and diagnosis are essentially the same as in Psittaciformes (see Chapter 32).",

Birds typically become infected through the inhalation of fungal spores from the environment. The spores germinate in the respiratory tract and incite a strong inflammatory response (Iadrola et al., 1998). The fungi can continue to spread within the respiratory system via production of new spores under aerobic conditions, direct seeding into the coelomic cavity and pneumatized bones can also occur (Converse, 2007, Richard and Thurston, 1983). Systemic spread is via macrophages or because Aspergillus is vasotropic via hematogenous route. Disease, occasionally termed \u201cbrooder pneumonia,\u201d tends to be more severe in younger birds (7\u201310 days after hatching in domestic chickens) in association with concurrent immunosuppression, infections, or stress (O\u2019Mearra and Witter, 1971). In captive settings, disease is commonly associated with poor husbandry, moldy feed or litter, damp bedding, high stocking densities, poor ventilation, or increased species, or breed susceptibility (Atkinson and Brojer, 1998). Aspergillosis causing morbidity and mortality is reported in free-ranging wild turkey (Davidson et al., 1985) and Gambel\u2019s quail (Guillion, 1957).",

Ascites is frequently reported in chickens, presumably associated with vascular failure (Julian and Goryo, 1990). Deformities of vertebrae due to osteomyelitis are observed in domestic chickens with chronic infections presumably from hematogenous spread (Bergman et al., 1980). Ocular aspergillosis can be subdivided into two conditions based upon the underlying pathogenesis. Topical exposure results in keratoconjunctivitis with caseous plaques beneath the nictitating membranes (more common in chickens), while hematogenous spread results in posterior opthalmitis or panopthalmitis (more common in turkey poults) (Swayne et al., 2013).",

Clinical signs include yellow colored droppings, depression, and death of affected birds.\nLesions are characterized by multifocal necrosis of the liver that have a bulls-eye appearance (Fig. 31.27\n) and necrotizing typhlitis with luminal necrotic cecal cores. Domestic chickens may carry this parasite and not demonstrate any clinical signs; however, turkeys, pheasants, and peafowl are highly susceptible. Guinea fowl, chukar, grouse, quail, and partridges can also be infected (Morishita and Schaul, 2007, Swayne et al., 2013). Cases of histomoniasis typically occur in birds that have access to the outdoors and can encounter arthropod intermediate hosts as well as ova within the environment. In captive birds, blackhead is usually passed from bird to bird within the ova of the nematode Heterakis gallinae. Mechanical transmission may occur via earthworms, flies, grasshoppers, sowbugs, and crickets. In a recent survey, blackhead was not evident in any of the wild turkeys surveyed despite identification of Heterakis gallinae in the intestine of several birds (Oates et al., 2005). Histomonas meleagridis is reported periodically in free-ranging wild turkeys (Hurst, 1980), but blackhead has a low prevalence in wild gallinaceous birds (Davidson and Doster, 2003, Davison and Wentworth, 1992).",

Blood films stained with Giemsa allow observation of parasites in the erythrocytes. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are commonly observed in birds that died from these infections; hemozoin (malarial pigment) may be seen histologically in some infections. PCR may be necessary for confirmation of infection, especially in low level infections, or to speciate the organisms.",

Lice are the most commonly reported ectoparasites in wild turkeys and pigeons (Adang et al., 2008, Lane et al., 2006). Transmission is by direct contact. Different common names applied to louse species originate mainly from the preferred site of infestation of the species (Swayne et al., 2013). Lice feed primarily on feathers or scavenged debris from feather surfaces (Fig. 31.28\n); they may also take blood, serum, and skin tissues. Clinical signs are associated with weight loss and restlessness due to constant irritation. Eggs are laid along the feather, and usually at the base of the shaft. Harm to the host is minimal, except in very heavy infections. Bathing, preening, and other grooming behaviors help to eliminate lice.",
