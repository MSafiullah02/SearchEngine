At least four defined panzootics have been recognized (Miller and Koch, 2013); negatively impacting not only economic livelihoods, but also human welfare by decreasing food supplies (Alders, 2014). After the initial, almost simultaneous, identification of Newcastle disease in 1926 in Indonesia, England, and possibly Korea, ND was identified to the Philippines, India, Japan, Australia, and Kenya. By 1952 it was also reported in Palestine, Syria, French Congo (present day Gabon, Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic), the island of Sicily, Europe, and the United States. In the 1960\u2019s as part of the 2nd and 3rd panzootics, ND was reported in Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, China and throughout Europe. These panzootics were aided both by the trade and movement of exotic psittacine birds without strict quarantine guidelines, the ubiquitous and synanthropic nature of pigeons, and the industrialization of the poultry industry (Alexander, 1988).",

Virus isolation, either in specific pathogen free (SPF) or NDV antibody-free embryonating chicken eggs or cell cultures, coupled with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) with NDV specific antiserum remain the definitive diagnostic assay for ND (OIE, 2012). The mean death time from the minimum lethal dose (MDT/MLD) assay performed on SPF embryonating chicken eggs continues to provide information on virulence for experimental purposes (Miller and Koch, 2013) and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) is required by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) due to the assay\u2019s ability to discern mixed infections that may be otherwise missed using molecular techniques (OIE, 2012).",

            "text": "Like all other RNA viruses, NDV is constantly evolving. As of 2013, Newcastle disease viruses have been grouped genetically into two classes with only one genotype of class I and 18 genotypes of class II. Historically, grouping NDV strains into genotypes based on the similarities of the genomes began as a way to provide epidemiological information (Lomniczi et al., 1998). The ability to explore the virus repositories of laboratories that had collected NDV strains over the years and to use new sequencing technologies provided previously unknown information as to how the various strains from different outbreaks related to one another. A better understanding on the epidemiological relations among the circulating NDV, their genetic diversity and characteristics, and global distribution is crucial for developing new vaccines and vaccination strategies. Genetic evaluation of the oldest NDV strains grouped them into what is now known as genotypes I, II, III, IV, and IX (Dimitrov et al., 2016b). While genotype I includes predominantly NDV of low virulence, genotype II strains may be virulent or of low virulence, and all of the characterized strains from III, IV, and IX contain cleavage site motifs of virulent strains. Excluding one virus from the 1940s, most genotype IX NDV strains were isolated after the 1980\u2019s in China (Dimitrov et al., 2016a).",

Currently, the effective containment of ND outbreaks is normally achieved with the utilization of a combination of vaccinations, rapid diagnostic assays, and culling of infected flocks. From the early 1950\u2019s to the late 1990\u2019s live and inactivated ND vaccines were the only vaccine platforms available and were used to decrease economic losses resulting from morbidity and mortality (Gallili and Ben-Nathan, 1998).",

The first live vaccines licensed in 1948 were formulated with strains now designated as virulent that produced disease in younger birds and were only applicable for use in chickens at least four-week old and needed to be applied with a wing-web application (Goldhaft, 1980). During this time several laboratories were investigating NDV strains that could be used as a live vaccine with acceptable levels of post-vaccinal clinical disease symptoms. Within two years, two NDV strains of low virulence (B1 and LaSota) isolated from chickens from the USA were also licensed for use (Goldhaft, 1980, Hitchner, 1975). Shortly after these products were available for individual bird administration, mass application techniques deemed necessary for larger commercial settings were investigated and implemented despite varying responses, because of uneven coverage in flocks and less than an optimal percentage of seroconverting birds (Lancaster, 1966). Since the earliest implementation of live ND vaccination, the transfer of antibodies to offspring that can even partially neutralize the live ND vaccines, was known to be a complication. It was also evident that even the vaccines formulated with the more virulent vaccine strains would not provide lifelong immunity and that additional vaccinations would be necessary in layers and breeders. Unfortunately, many of the problems in controlling ND that were clear from the first few decades of ND vaccine use, continue in 2016.",

Besides chickens, other birds (pigeons, cormorants, psittacines, pheasants, peafowl, wild waterfowl and shorebirds) are often reported with infections of virulent NDV (Cardenas Garcia et al., 2013, Diel et al., 2012a, Pearson and McCann, 1975) and NDV of low virulence (Kim et al., 2007). In general, turkeys are slightly more resistant to NDV than chickens; however, some wild-bird NDV strains that have adapted to turkeys are able to infect this species more readily (Dr. Patti Miller, unpublished data). Geese and ducks also show some resistance to infection, with ducks rarely presenting signs of clinical disease and geese showing slightly higher susceptibility, depending on the strain of NDV.",

The roles of the different bird species reported with infections of NDV in the maintenance of the disease are still unclear. Nevertheless, their importance should not be underestimated as sometimes they are reared in large flocks in close proximity to poultry, and their vaccination (when appropriate and feasible) could contribute to the control of ND. Vaccination protocols for these species are dependent on national and international regulations and the specific epidemiological situation (OIE, 2012).",

Viruses circulating in poultry were the source of the LaSota, B1, and VG/GA vaccines. All of those viruses belong to genotype II and are genetically and antigenically highly related among themselves (>98% nucleotide identity). The main differences among those vaccines are the tropism and the capacity to replicate in na\u00efve chickens, which is highest in LaSota and results in higher levels of neutralizing antibodies compared to other strains (Meulemans, 1988). Thus, the LaSota strain is nearly always used in countries where virulent NDV is endemic (Diel et al., 2012b). The VG/GA strain is normally sold as an enterotropic vaccine, and the B1 strain as the most attenuated vaccine to be used in cases of low challenges or in very young birds. While live vaccines provide both mucosal and humoral immunity and can be administered using mass application techniques, they may cause clinical respiratory disease, drop in egg production, and are easily inactivated when not kept at the required temperature (commonly 4 \u00b0C) (Winterfield and Dhillon, 1981).",

Doses of the LaSota vaccine of 106 EID50 or higher produced strong humoral immune responses and no increase in titers was observed after challenge, suggesting little to no replication of the challenge virus (Cornax et al., 2012). Similar survival rates and viral shedding amounts after challenge with virulent NDV strains from genotype VII have been observed with the LaSota vaccines in SPF chickens (Dr. Cardenas Garcia, University of Georgia, USA, personal communication) (Samuel et al., 2013). Cornax et al. results suggested that it may be possible to achieve the three objectives of vaccination when a very high dose of vaccine is used (Cornax et al., 2012). Those results appear to be confirmed by results in the field in which a more aggressive vaccination strategy often results in improved ND control. Unfortunately, the administration of high doses of classical ND vaccines significantly increases the cost of vaccination, thus this practice is not widely utilized.",

            "text": "Inactivated ND vaccines have the disadvantage of requiring a withdrawal period before vaccinated birds can be processed for human consumption, and each vaccine requires individual administration by a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Even though birds vaccinated with inactivated vaccines tend to have higher humoral antibody levels, they do not develop a strong cell mediated response (Schijns et al., 2013), and shed larger amounts of virulent challenge virus compared to birds vaccinated with live ND vaccines (Miller et al., 2013, Miller et al., 2009). Although live and inactivated vaccines protect against clinical disease in SPF chickens, there are continuous reports of vaccine failures under field conditions (Perozo et al., 2012, Rehmani et al., 2015). One of the possible reasons for these failures may be poor vaccination response that is also dependent on field-associated factors unrelated to the vaccines, such as immunosuppression (Meulemans, 1988) from infections prior to ND vaccination. Different avian pathogens such as Infectious bronchitis virus, Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1, Infectious bursal disease virus, and Mycoplasma spp. have been associated with immunosuppressive effects. Understanding the role of field factors and field immunosuppressing agents during and after ND vaccination may lead to the development of more effective vaccines or vaccination strategies. Vaccines that are co-expressing antigens of different pathogens and are simultaneously inducing immunity against several avian diseases would be of great value. Presence of maternal antibodies interferes with the development of active immunity when live vaccines are administered via intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal route, in drinking water, and through aerosol. In chickens with maternal immunity, the best response to live ND vaccine is achieved through conjunctival and intranasal routes of administration, perhaps due to the development of local immunity induced by these vaccines. However, immunity induced by inactivated vaccines was less affected by the presence of maternal antibodies (Lancaster, 1966).",

In 1990, the Fowlpox virus (FPV) vector-based vaccines expressing the NDV F or HN protein were proven to protect chickens from a challenge with virulent NDV (Boursnell et al., 1990). Later, multiple studies were conducted, employing both genes (alone or in combination, also with other viral genes), to investigate the protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccines (Karaca et al., 1998, Taylor et al., 1996). While some have shown that maternal antibodies to the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein can interfere with recombinant FPV (rFPV) vaccines expressing HA (Faulkner et al., 2013), others have shown that immunity to FPV from previous FPV vaccinations, not maternal antibodies, are the problem (Bublot et al., 2006). At least two commercial rFPV-ND vaccines have been registered and are sold commercially. However, the rFPV-ND vaccines are not widely used because they cannot be applied through mass methods. Furthermore, previous exposure to FPV, which is commonly present in the environment, decreases efficacy of the rFPV vaccines.",

            "text": "While the replication of rHVT-ND vaccines appears to be mildly hindered by the presence of maternal antibodies (Le Gros et al., 2009), they are able to prevent clinical disease and mortality when challenged with a virulent NDV six weeks after vaccination (Sonoda et al., 2000). The antibodies induced after the administration of the rHVT-ND vaccines occur at the same time in which maternal antibodies are waning. The rHVT-ND vaccines have many benefits, among these is that they can be administered in ovo at the hatchery or subcutaneously after hatch, and produce long-term immunity (Armour and Garc\u00eda, 2014, Esaki et al., 2013). However, the rHVT-ND vaccines are cell associated, so like Marek\u2019s disease vaccines, they are required to be kept in liquid nitrogen, and to be administered within an hour of being thawed. Unfortunately, rHVT-ND require four weeks before full immunity will be reached (Palya et al., 2012), which would require the strictest level of biosecurity to prevent infection during that period. This may be impossible in countries where ND is endemic. Recombinant HVT vaccines have been widely used in countries where minimum viral challenges exist; however, in endemic countries, these vaccines may need to be used in combination with other ND vaccines to confer acceptable protection. After hatch, the administration of a killed or live ND vaccine to birds that were vaccinated in ovo with rHVT-ND vaccine, increases the level of immunity to facilitate more complete protection and helps decrease the amount of virulent NDV shed after challenge (Palya et al., 2014). This approach is commonly referred to as a Prime-Boost strategy. Because of the lack of simple serologic tests to measure the immune response to rHVT-ND vaccines expressing the NDV fusion protein, a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to evaluate the rHVT-ND vaccine load from feather follicles has been developed (Rauw et al., 2015). This approach may be helpful in evaluating if rHVT vaccine administration was successful. A commercial ELISA kit has been recently advertised that can detect anti-NDV antibodies induced by rHVT-ND vaccines.",

This technology allows researchers to genetically manipulate the genome of NDV and insert non-NDV genes in it. This lead to the development of genetically engineered vaccines while retaining the replication competency of the original virus. Since then, using the reverse genetics technology, many strains of NDV have been developed as vectors to express proteins encoded by the inserted foreign gene for the purposes of developing avian vaccines and for human cancer therapy. A comprehensive review lists the main features of NDVs that allows them to be promising vaccine vector: they replicate well in vivo, induce a robust mucosal and systemic immune response, allow easy genetic manipulation, and avirulent strains usually used for vaccine vectors are safe, do not recombine, and do not incorporate into the DNA genome during replication (Kim and Samal, 2016).",

Recently, the experimental use of a modified virulent NDV vector-based vaccine expressing AIV H5 protein was reported and showed the potential of virulent NDV to be used as vectors (Kim et al., 2014). A NDV vector-based vaccine expressing H5 protein was recently commercialized (Sarfati-Mizrahi et al., 2010). These rNDV-AIV vaccines are heavily used in the field in China with roughly 11.7 billion doses having been applied from 2006 through 2012 (Li et al., 2014a). Limited data from Mexico is available, but during a three-month period in 2008, 32 million doses of rNDV-AIV were administered (Villarreal, 2009).",

Some of them increased the capacity of expressing a larger gene or more than one foreign gene. Expression of a foreign protein through an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) from a second open reading frame in a NDV vector has also been investigated (Zhang et al., 2015), and results suggest that the NP gene downstream non-coding region is the optimal insertion site for a high level of foreign gene protein expression.",

            "text": "Not all rNDV vaccines are equal in their levels of immunogenicity or their ability to replicate in chickens, therefore, each vaccine that is created should be evaluated for its ability to replicate in chickens, and to induce a protective immune response against a virulent NDV challenge. The immune response to vaccination with recombinant vaccines is influenced by many factors, and the expression of the desired level of foreign genes is undoubtedly one of the most important and critical factors for the success of the vaccine. The level of foreign gene expression from a NDV vector can be affected by the rate of replication, the tissue tropism of the viral vector, the size and the sequence of the foreign gene insert, and the genomic location of the foreign gene in the vector. Among these, the genomic location of the foreign gene has been shown to be crucial. To date, most of the foreign genes have been inserted into a non-coding region in the NDV genome as an additional independent transcription unit that consists of NDV gene start (GS), the foreign gene, and NDV gene end (GE) sequences (DiNapoli et al., 2007, Huang et al., 2004, Nakaya et al., 2001, Park et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2014). Based on the sequential transcription of negative stranded RNA viruses (Lamb and Parks, 2013), the best position for foreign gene expression is hypothesized to be the closest to the 3\u2019end of NDV genome. However, the insertion of a foreign gene as an ITU into a promoter-proximal position may interfere with NDV replication more seriously than a promoter-distal position, resulting in lower levels of foreign gene expression (Carnero et al., 2009, Zhao and Peeters, 2003, Zhao et al., 2015b). Therefore, a balance in virus replication and the abundance of foreign gene expression must be considered for selection of a foreign gene insertion site. The insertion of a foreign gene more proximal to the 3\u2032 end, between the NP and P gene, expressed a low level of the foreign protein (Carnero et al., 2009). Further studies supported the conclusion that the P and M junction region is the optimal insertion site for an optimal level of foreign gene expression by a NDV vector (Nakaya et al., 2001, Zhao et al., 2015b).",

It is not uncommon for the virus strains used in vaccines for respiratory diseases caused by paramyxoviruses, such as measles and canine distemper, to be changed over time to improve the efficacy of the vaccine and the achieved immunity (Griffin and Pan, 2009, Martella et al., 2011). These changes are made when the virulent challenge strains accumulate too many genomic mutations over time, and the vaccine virus strains are no longer similar antigenically to the challenge strain. Avian influenza viruses with their multiple serotypes require serotype specific vaccines to prevent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the shedding of virulent HPAI challenge virus after infection was decreased with smaller amounts HPAI shed when the vaccine and challenge virus were more similar (Swayne, 2003). The principle of utilizing a NDV strain closely related or homologous to the challenge strain was tested by our laboratory and produced similar findings (Miller et al., 2013, Miller et al., 2009, Miller et al., 2007).",

Our recent finding of improvements in clinical protection in sub-optimally vaccinated chickens suggests that the advantages of antigenically matched vaccines may be even clearer in the field than under laboratory conditions. Vaccines homologous to NDV genotype V are heavily used in Mexico with 1.1 billion doses applied from January 2015 through July 2016 (Dr. Arnulfo Toscano, Investigaci\u00f3n Aplicada S.A.de C.V., Mexico, personal communication), suggesting that the market is starting to appreciate the benefits of a reduction in viral shedding. A disadvantage of homologous vaccines is the difficulty of the vaccine company to work with virulent NDV in the laboratory because of the need for higher biosecurity. Most countries do not have vaccine companies with the level of biosecurity to safely make antigenically matched vaccines.",

However, live NDV given in ovo can cause decreased hatchability and weak chicks. An innovative approach was developed to use an antigen-antibody complex live ND vaccine for in ovo vaccination to slow the replication without adversely affecting the hatchability. The NDV specific antibodies were able to dissociate from the vaccine virus after the birds hatched, resulting in acceptable hatchability, otherwise not achieved with even the least virulent, asymptomatic wild type or recombinant NDV strains administered in ovo (Kapczynski et al., 2012).",

Innate immune system specifically recognizes foreign pathogens (or their pathogen-associated molecular patterns) with the help of pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a type of PRR and efforts have been made to enhance vaccine potency and to stimulate immune responses by using TLR ligands as adjuvants (Gupta et al., 2014). In a recent review by Gupta et al., chicken TLRs agonists and their use as adjuvants in vaccines against poultry infectious diseases (including ND) have been extensively described (Gupta et al., 2014). Ramakrishnan and colleagues demonstrated significant up-regulation of the transcriptional expression of interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-4, and TLR-7 genes in chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells after administration of resiquimod (R-848, a TLR-7 agonist) (Ramakrishnan et al., 2015) and the synergetic effect of R-848 and lipopolysaccharide, a TLR-4 agonist (Annamalai et al., 2015). The use of R-848 as an adjuvant for inactivated ND vaccine administered intramuscularly in chickens showed significantly up-regulated expression of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, inducible nitric oxide synthase and MHC-II genes and increased protection after virulent NDV challenge when compared to two inactivated ND vaccines used alone (Sachan et al., 2015). Lipopolysaccharide used in combination with liposome encapsulated NDV administered to chickens via the intranasal route induced significant tracheal IgA and serum IgG levels, with increased levels of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and 80% survival after virulent NDV challenge (Tseng et al., 2009). When polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I: C, TLR-3 ligand) was used in chicken embryo cells and exposed to NDV, it induced an antiviral state and reduced the plaque-forming capacity of the NDV (Gupta et al., 2014).",

CpG motifs are recognized as pathogen patterns by the innate immune system to activate defensive mechanisms and induce the immune response of immunized chickens (Vleugels et al., 2002). After internalization by target cells, CpG ODNs reach the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment where they signal by interacting with TLR-21 (chicken ortholog of TLR-9). After intramuscular and intranasal administration, CpG ODN enhanced the activity of a ND vaccine in chickens; increasing the systemic antigen-specific IgG levels in serum (T-cell proliferation), and mucosal (IgA) levels when administered intranasally. Specific-pathogen-free chickens co-vaccinated with ND vaccines and at least 100 \u03bcg of CpG ODN by either route were protected from challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of virulent NDV (Zhang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2008). Vaccines containing CpG ODNs can be applied either systemically or via the mucosa, have good safety profiles, increase the immunogenicity of co-administered vaccines by improving the function of professional antigen-presenting cells, and boost the humoral and cellular vaccine-specific immune responses, highlighting their potential to be used as effective adjuvants for NDV and other poultry vaccines (Vleugels et al., 2002).",

Chicken IFN-\u03b3 (chiINF- \u03b3) is a macrophage activation modulator, inhibits viral replication, promotes development of the Th1 response by inhibiting Th2 cytokine production, and enhances antigen presentation and antigen processing and destruction of intracellular pathogens. This cytokine has been shown to improve protection and enhance immune responses in avian species against different avian pathogens; however, no commercial product has ever reached the market, and controversial results highlight the need for further evaluation of the potential of this cytokine (Cardenas Garcia et al., 2016). Cardenas Garcia et al. demonstrated that co-delivering chicken IFN-\u03b3 with a ND vaccine using three vaccination systems (DNA-vaccine administered in ovo, recombinant vaccine expressing chiINF-\u03b3 used in ovo, and inactivated recombinant vaccine expressing chiINF-\u03b3 administered subcutaneously in two-week-old SPF chickens) did not improve the immunogenicity or the protective efficacy of the evaluated vaccine candidates (Cardenas Garcia et al., 2016). Expression of chicken IL-2 by a highly virulent strain of NDV led to decreased systemic viral load, but did not significantly affect mortality in chickens (Susta et al., 2015a), while expression of IFN-\u03b3 by the same virulent NDV attenuated the virus and decreased morbidity and mortality in SPF chickens (Susta et al., 2013).",

Some TLR combinations can produce a stronger and selective immune response, and others can down-regulate cytokine expression (Gupta et al., 2014). Cytokines are components of a fine-balanced network of immune responses with multiple feedback loops (Schat, 2015); thus, it is possible that inserting cytokine genes or using TLR ligands may deregulate the fine-tuning that exists in the naturally perfectly-timed system that leads to an enhanced immune response (Cardenas Garcia et al., 2016). In addition, the immunomodulatory effect of cytokines and TLR ligands may depend on various factors, such as the type of the pathogen, the amount and type of the co-delivered antigen, the relative time of administration, and the amount of delivered cytokine/ligand. Further studies to evaluate these approaches and the level of protection they induce in comparison to the existing traditional vaccines are necessary.",

The nanoparticle delivery systems protect the delivered antigen from disruption and have advantages such as higher antigen uptake, controlled release, and increased duration of responses (Dai et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2016b). Many types of materials, such as polylactic acid, poly (lactide-co-glycolide), calcium phosphate, carboxymethylcellulose, chitosan, and magnesium phosphate among others, can be used as nanoparticle carriers and administered by multiple routes including oral, mucosal, and parenteral (Dai et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2016b). Two chitosan derivatives, O-2\u02b9-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan and N-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride chitosan, have been utilized to make nanoparticles as a mucosal delivery vehicle for live attenuated ND vaccines (Dai et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2016b). In both systems the release of NDV was effective and sustainable and resulted in stronger cellular, humoral, and mucosal immune responses as measured by levels of specific humoral and local antibodies, spleen lymphocyte proliferation, and levels of cytokines. Both systems also conferred protection upon challenge with virulent NDV and no clinical signs or microscopic lesions were observed in vaccinated birds, while 20% mortality and some hyperplastic changes were observed in the chickens vaccinated with a traditional commercial ND vaccine.",

Recently, a delivery system required to deploy conventional unmodified replicon mRNAs based on the genomes of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) as a vaccine was developed (Chahal et al., 2016). This system supports self-amplification via a double-stranded RNA intermediate in the cytoplasm to drive efficient expression of the immunogenic antigen. Single dose modified dendrimer nanoparticle (MDNP)-delivered VEEV replicon RNAs encoding single or multiple pathogen proteins were shown to protect mice against lethal infection of H1N1 influenza virus (A/WSN/33), Ebola virus or Toxoplasma gondii. This synthetic highly innovative, adjuvant-free system is flexible and can multiplex (co-formulate and co-express) different antigen-expressing replicons (i.e. simultaneously raise immunity against multiple antigens from a single disease and/or multiple antigens from multiple diseases). Moreover, it induces vital antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell and antibody responses without additional adjuvants (Chahal et al., 2016). While the system has not been tested in chickens, some of its main advantages are that the design and production of the vaccines take only 2 weeks, do not require high biosecurity level facilities, and allow for a rapid and on-demand response to currently circulating pathogens, including highly diverse NDV strains.",

Many different paramyxovirus VLPs can be produced upon expression of the M protein or M protein with various combinations of the glycoproteins and NP after the transfection of cells with vectors containing cDNAs encoding for these proteins, with ND VLPs having high efficiency of release (Morrison, 2010). Newcastle disease VLPs, although not being commercialized, have a potential to incorporate glycoproteins of different strains of NDV, could potentially be used against different ND viruses (McGinnes et al., 2010), and have significant potential applications as they can be designed to express protein sequences from many pathogens (Morrison, 2010).",

However, as evident from the multiple outbreaks occurring worldwide, current vaccination strategies are not fully efficacious under different environmental conditions and the development of new concepts for vaccine generation are needed. To enhance the efficacy of vaccines and to improve the immune responses induced by them, investigation of innovative approaches together with the development of safe and novel strong adjuvants are necessary. Future ND vaccine systems that allow rapid development to target emerging NDV strains, and enable design of multiplexed vaccines, will have advantage over currently existing vaccines.",
