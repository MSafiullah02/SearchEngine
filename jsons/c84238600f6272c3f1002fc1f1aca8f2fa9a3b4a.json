Consequently, multiple federal and state governments have placed restrictions on hospitals such as limiting \"elective surgery\" and recommending social or physical distancing. We review the literature on several areas that have been affected including surgical selection, inpatient care, and physician well-being. These areas affecting inpatient paradigms include surgical priority, physical or social distancing, file sharing for online clinical communications, and physician wellness. During this crisis, it is important that orthopaedic departments place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus so that the department can still maintain vital functions. Physical distancing and emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from the novel coronavirus spread. This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic departments during an unprecedented time. Orthopaedic surgeons should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, wear PPE when appropriate, have teams created using physical distancing, understand the department's policy on elective surgery, and engage in routines which enhance physician wellness.",

            "text": "On March 14, 2020, the surgeon general recommended that all elective surgeries be canceled. However, the use of the term \"elective\" has fallen victim to scrutiny, with notable room for subjective interpretation among surgeons. When considering which surgeries to delay and which ones to prioritize, there are several factors to consider. For clarification, it is important to understand that an orthopaedic surgery can be classified as urgent inpatient (intertrochanteric femur fracture), urgent outpatient (flexor digitorum profundus rupture), elective inpatient, and elective outpatient. The orthopaedic department leadership needs to determine what are the prioritized objectives about demand for hospital beds, PPE inventory, and other limited resources including intravenous (IV) fluids, ventilators, and personnel. 5 Targeted reduction on surgeries can be performed for a variety of reasons. Some hospitals may have the objective to vacate inpatient beds. In this scenario, it is important to classify surgeries based on whether they can be performed as outpatient versus inpatient. As such, elective surgeries requiring inpatient admission may be postponed, whereas elective cases that can be accomplished as outpatient are permitted. 4 When admission is required, valuable resources such as beds, nursing, and supplies are necessary, and their limited stock is depleted. These resources can, instead, be preserved by decreasing elective orthopaedic surgery requiring inpatient admission. If the main concern is shortage of ventilators and anesthesia staff, consideration may be made toward moving urgent outpatient surgery to a local ambulatory surgery center (ASC) to decrease utilization of these resources at the inpatient hospital. 6 During the COVID-19 pandemic, vital resources such as hospital beds and rooms as well as ventilators may become scarce. This experience in Singapore with the current COVID-19 crisis has already been documented. Chang Liang et al 4 reported that their department postponed or canceled all nonurgent procedures that needed an inpatient admission. This mainly affected spine surgery, elective pediatric cases, and hip and knee arthroplasty. Other surgeons may use the length of stay (LOS) as a metric to determine which procedures should be performed during this difficult time because longer hospital stays may exhaust more coveted resources and may place patients at increased risk of nosocomial infection.",

The authors reported that sport, hand, and some spine procedures typically have less than 1 day stay, whereas arthroplasty ranged from 2.2 to 3.4 days. The authors also identified which comorbidities are associated with increased LOS. They found that increased age, diabetes, general anesthesia, morbid obesity, COPD, poor nutrition, congestive heart failure, non-Caucasian race, and hypertension were correlated with increased LOS. Current times have shown that individuals with more comorbidities are more predisposed to worse clinical outcomes from the coronavirus. 8 Surgeons may use data such as this to objectively decide which cases are and are not appropriate surgeries, given local resources and pandemic status. In addition, surgeons should optimize modifiable risk factors preoperatively and manage them postoperatively in an effort to decrease LOS. 7 Orthopaedic surgeons, as always, should make sure that preoperative diabetes mellitus is controlled as best as possible. Additional consideration should be given to use regional anesthesia if possible, consulting a nutritionist and internal medicine consultation for assistance with other preoperative comorbidities. 7 Orthopaedic Surgical Selection: Elective, Urgent, and Emergency Surgery",

However, choosing which surgeries to postpone is not easily determined without some controversy. Some recommendations may be to postpone all surgeries that can be delayed more than 1 month. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services advises that a surgery can be delayed if it will not cause harm to the patient and they recommend creating a tiered framework for prioritization. 9 We have categorized major orthopaedic surgeries by how long they can safely be delayed according to the previous studies (Table 1) . Deciding which surgeries to cancel may not be as simple as a binary decision (elective versus nonelective). Depending on the phase of the disease locally, orthopaedic programs may move into more of an emergency surgery situation and then move toward allowing elective surgery, then move back into an emergency surgery only situation again. This could occur with quiescent phases, followed by new outbreaks. This second phase phenomenon occurred in Canada with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereby a second wave of infection followed the initial recovery. 10 To clarify what previous literature has found regarding urgency of orthopaedic surgeries, we have categorized orthopaedic surgeries into five categories based on priority: priority A (emergency surgery within 24 hours), priority B (urgent surgery within ,48 hours), priority C (expedited surgery within 2 weeks), priority D (short-term delayed ,3 months), and priority E (long-term delayed .3 months). We recommend moving between these categories in a continuum based on the needs and priorities of the region and hospital system. The surgeries which are routinely performed outpatient are also delineated in this classification system, and orthopaedic departments should also determine whether they are doing inpatient and/or outpatient surgery for each category.",

Examples include a hip fracture in the elderly, surgical thoracolumbar fracture, or cauda equina syndrome. 12, 19, 20 The term \"expedited\" has been used to describe procedures where there is no an immediate threat to life or limb. 11, 21 Expedited surgeries are most surgical fractures and surgical tendon ruptures where surgical treatment should not be delayed more than 2 weeks because delay past that point leads to worse outcomes or difficult surgery. 11, [22] [23] [24] [25] In addition, delay of surgeries such as delayed closure or flap coverage for open fractures more than 2 weeks can lead to chronic infection or loss of limb. 26 Short-term delayed surgeries are procedures that can wait for weeks, but there is literature that supports increased pathology when waiting more than 3 months, such as with ACL reconstruction, myelopathy, or nerve compression with worsening symptoms or muscle weakness. [27] [28] [29] [30] Finally, long-term delayed surgeries are ones that can be delayed more than 3 months, such as a total knee arthroplasty. 31 Stratification of orthopaedic procedures based on severity and urgency can therefore help conserve and redirect limited resources toward those who may require them more emergently during this health crisis.",

If hospital bed availability is of greatest concern, priority E inpatient surgeries requiring inpatient stays may be postponed. 4 When all resources are being rationed, all priority D and E surgeries may be postponed. During this phase, attempts should be made at performing urgent and expedited surgeries, which are outpatient, at an ASC or surgical hospital separate from the local inpatient hospital. 4, 6, 33 As hospitals move into a recovery phase where resources are more abundant, we recommend performing priority D surgeries before priority E surgeries in case a second phase phenomenon occurs.",

Currently, there are some regions where the strain on resources is so high that local ASCs have been closed. In areas where ASCs remain open for clinical care, they can still play a vital role in providing expedited surgical care to alleviate some of the burden on traditional hospitalbased surgery systems. ASCs play a vital role in caring for underserved patients because 13.6% of their patients are Medicaid payers, and the average time for surgical visits at ASC surgical visits are 25% to 39% shorter than hospital outpatient department visits. 34 These more efficient visits, which have been shown to have lower cost, may use less resources, making ASCs a potentially important player for conservation of medical supplies. Finally, ASCs have been shown to have a low infection rate of 0.484%. 35 As major inpatient hospitals prepare to face an increased burden of COVID-19 patients, it may also be beneficial for patients to have their vital orthopaedic surgeries redirected to an ASC, where there are no COVID-19 inpatients being simultaneously cared for. 6 ",

The American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine has posted a video giving guidance for athletes who have had their elective surgery postponed. 37 The AAOS has released a statement that guidelines should be based on resources including personnel, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, PPE, and respirators. 38 They have also recommended a panel including the chief of the ICU, chief of orthopaedic surgery, chief of anesthesia, and head of the hospital to review possible surgeries. The AAOS has also supported guidelines from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the ACS. The ACS has released orthopaedic guidelines stating that during phase 2 (curtail elective) and phase 3 (eliminate elective), many surgeries should still be performed. They list joint dislocations, quad and patella tendon ruptures, aggressive tumors, impending fractures, lacerated tendons, and many fractures as surgeries that should still be performed.

This fact is especially important when it pertains to airway management of patients with COVID-19. The repercussions of intubating a patient who unknowingly carries the disease can be extreme because the whole surgical team can become exposed to the virus as it becomes aerosolized in an unabated manner during this process. However, if the surgical patient is already known to be a carrier, then precautionary measures can be taken to mitigate further transmission. 41 Because of the gravity of intubating a missed patient with COVID-19, the role of preoperative screening should be given notable consideration. At the time of this publication, there are no established guidelines for preoperative screening for COVID-19. As tests becomes more rapid and accessible than at the infancy of the pandemic, preoperative screening can certainly become a reality. Currently, the international community has turned to already afflicted countries such as China and Italy for guidance.",

Another study from several hospitals in China evaluated 34 elective orthopaedic surgery patients who were in the incubation period of COVID-19. These patients unintentionally had surgery without anyone knowing they were infected with COVID-19 before surgery. A large portion of these patients had major complications with a 20.5% mortality and 44.1% rate of ICU admission postoperatively. 43 The main utility for identification of patients with COVID-19 before orthopaedic surgery would be to avoid these complications and protect medical staff further. 44 5 Another consideration is to limit the number of surgeons or assistants in a particular case. Orthopaedic surgeons are typically part of a small, specialized team, and it is critical that the entire team does not become ill simultaneously. This would cripple the ability of the facility to provide effective orthopaedic care to patients. It stands to reason that any orthopaedic surgeon known to be infected with COVID-19 should be quarantined at home until they are no longer contagious. However, there are several measures that orthopaedic physicians can take that will limit the spread of the virus within their team, should a team member become unknowingly infected.

Coronavirus is estimated to live on surfaces anywhere from several hours up to several days. 48 Items such as computer keyboards can act as fomites and can theoretically Chart showing resource-based strategy of orthopaedic surgery priorities. Based on which resources are needed, surgeons may prioritize different surgeries. Surgeons may move between phases on a continuum. During all phases, outpatient surgery may be moved to a separate surgery center to mitigate risk and conserve resources at the inpatient hospital.

            "text": "Telemedicine has become an increasingly popular method to serve patients while limiting in-person interactions to decrease the spread of COVID-19. Although telemedicine has become popularized in the outpatient setting across multiple disciplines during the COVID-19 crisis, there appears to be a role within the inpatient setting as well. Specialties such as allergy/immunology, dermatology, infectious disease, and even surgery have already implemented roles for telemedicine for inpatients, with equal and satisfactory results as in-person encounters. [49] [50] [51] [52] For orthopaedic surgeons, this may include using computers/tablets to interview and examine patients known, or suspected, to be infected with coronavirus. Orthopaedic surgeons should only expose themselves to a COVID-19 positive patient if absolutely necessary, such as to reduce a fracture or dislocation. Inpatient postoperative physical contact on known COVID-19 positive patients can also be limited to things such as dressing changes. Use of this technology as an alternative to in-person encounters is a viable option when the risk of contracting and propagating the virus in a contaminated environment is a real concern. Nosocomial transmission can also be reduced by minimizing the traffic in and out of a known coronavirus patient's room. Varia et al 53 found that with the SARS outbreak of 2003, the risk of acquiring the droplet-spread virus correlated with the distance to the patient. In addition, inside patient rooms that require contact precautions, not only are the patients contagious but also the medical equipment and accommodations within the room can also become niduses for infection. 54 A novel way of decreasing this traffic can be the creation of an auxiliary space for medical supplies such as IV poles and associated fluids and medications, which can be accessed physically outside of a patient's room. We have developed a system which decreases PPE usage and exposure to medical staff, as seen in Figure 3 . Many of these monitors and fluid management systems are traditionally adjacent to the bedside, requiring nursing staff and physicians to come in close proximity to the patient when they need to be used. In these situations, this can potentiate the spread of highly contagious pathogens from one patient to another when a healthcare personnel needs to perform activities such as changing IV fluids or medications right next to the patient and possibly acquiring the disease inadvertently. The traffic can be avoided, and the contamination of other inanimate objects within a room can be minimized if these fluids and monitors are stationed physically outside the patient's room instead.",

In 1989, Brown et al investigated mice specimens that received a vaccine for the flu virus and showed that sleep deprivation counteracted the effects of the vaccine, making it appear \"as though they had never been immunized.\" 56 Many studies since then have tried to replicate the results and further explore the effects of sleep deprivation on immunity. [57] [58] [59] [60] Benedict et al 59 showed that in human beings, the antibody response to the H1N1 vaccine was delayed in the first few days in the patients who were sleep deprived but no difference past that initial value. Furthermore, Irwin et al demonstrated that natural killer cell activity was decreased in sleep deprived activity. 60 Natural killer cells play a role in viral infection by containing early viral replication and destroying infected cells. 61 Aside from immunity, sleep plays a role in mental well-being. Studies from occupational health studies suggest that acute sleep loss is equivalent to alcoholic intoxication with concerns in productivity and decision-making. 62, 63 In addition, a chronic state of lesser sleep deprivation results in similar mental deficits as acute deprivation. 62 Remaining free of cognitive impairment during this period is critical when you consider paying attention to small details such as donning PPE correctly, recognizing if one is feeling tired from lack of sleep or if this is a part of a constellation of infectious symptoms requiring evaluation, and also to help with clinical comprehension.",

This includes fellow colleagues to discuss and process the current events and normal social activities which people used to relax for work stresses, such as going to a brewery to grab a beer with friends. It gets even worse if you are the unfortunate individual to contract the disease. If you are hospitalized, you will be confined alone within a room, often hours before seeing anyone else because of people trying to limit exposure. (2) Stigmatization: There is a lot of fear surrounding the epidemic. Fear of patients can affect the delivery of care. Fear of having the disease can incite people to congest the testing centers. It can also do the opposite in which individuals may downplay symptoms. This second issue could be a particular issue for orthopaedic providers. Healthcare providers my downplay symptoms in an effort to continue to care for patients. (3) Guilt: As a healthcare worker, it is not an uncommon battle to balance work and home life. Not only are we risking exposure to ourselves at work every day but also bringing home a certain amount of risk to our families. Our team has taken families into consideration by education about changing clothes and showering before coming in contact and inquiring about families' well-being. This not only helps decrease the amount of exposure but again enhances a sense of community. (4) Helplessness: Even persons not involved in direct care of infected populations feel the psychologic impact. There has been a push for \"nonessential\" personnel to be sent home. There is concern that this label implies that a person is not as important as they truly are. The continuation of roles at home gives nonessential individuals something purposeful to do and keep up a normal routine. Change in role, where an individual becomes essential, may be more beneficial. The retrospective evaluation by Maunder et al. 67 showed that people who were recalled from home into an altered role showed more \"psychologic satisfaction.\"",

We have specifically created three resident teams. This leaves one team on the inpatient service at all times (our higher risk exposure group), one team maintaining lower volume, lesser risk services (such as mostly elective services that have reduced volume), and a reserve service (at home, educational and research focused). The staff also have rotations where the inpatient trauma staff rotate to allow coverage if individuals become ill and limit their exposure to the higher risk inpatient setting. In addition, the staff who is not working in the inpatient setting remains isolated in the outpatient setting with a transition to increased use of telemedicine and assistance with administrative duties and supporting the continuation of practices. This continues to allow individuals to work and will create periods of less highrisk exposure for less transmission to self and families. This also increases time for self-care. (3) Self-care focus. Shift work increases time to catch up on sleep. Our normal conferences typically occurred at 6 AM, but our videoconferences were shifted to 4 PM to allow people more time to sleep. Staff has recommended good nutrition and exercise, with increased time to allow providers to accomplish both.",

Modifying surgical selection is paramount to fulfill the needs of the entire health system. Depending on the needs of the local community and the phase of COVID-19 outbreak in a specific area, the surgical selection priorities may change. It remains important that orthopaedic programs place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus so that the department can still maintain vital functions. Emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from COVID-19 spread. This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic surgeons during an unprecedented time. Orthopaedic surgeons should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, wear PPE when appropriate, have teams created that use inpatient physical/social distancing, use online file sharing for clinical communication, understand the department's policy on surgical selection, and engage in routines which enhance physician wellness.",
