Presumed function of OspA and OspB is the adhesion to tick gut epithelium. When tick starts blood feeding on the vertebrate host, both proteins are downregulated.

It enables Borrelia escape from specifi c humoral response due to high VlsE variability. Early humoral response to Borrelia is characterised by production of IgM antibodies specifi c to OspC, fl agellins (p39 and p41), and BmpA (p39).

Based on these results, LYMErix was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 21, 1998. Subsequently, hundreds of vaccinee reported the development of autoimmune side effects. Supported by some patient advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were fi led against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), who found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints [ 22 , 23 ] . Despite the lack of evidence, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the US market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002 in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects.",

The most common modes of association include covalent lipid conjugation (either preor post-vesicle formation), non-covalent surface attachment (via biotin, NTA-Ni-His, or antibody-epitope interactions), encapsulation, and surface adsorption (Fig. 36.2 ) . Many of the early studies of liposomal peptide and protein antigenicity in mice compared encapsulated antigens to those conjugated to the surface of preformed liposomes. Early studies by Alving, Gregoriadis, Therien, and others confi rmed that both methods are generally effective for inducing antibody and T-cell responses to associated protein antigens such as albumin and tetanus toxoid [ 58 -60 ] . In some cases, covalent antigen conjugation results in superior antibody induction, which is not surprising because B-cell receptors can recognise intact antigen on the liposome surface [ 61 ] . As the size and complexity of the antigen decreases, the benefi t of their surface conjugation for antibody induction becomes more pronounced, as found for the synthetic peptides for which surface conjugation provides immune responses superior to encapsulation [ 61 , 62 ] .",

This problem could be divided into two fi elds: fi rst, the stability of the liposomes themselves and second, the effect of the components presented in biological fl uids (e.g. proteins and ions) on the stability of the metallochelating bond. In the example of OspC proteoliposomes, the gel permeation chromatography data indicated a good in vitro stability of the OspC proteoliposomes during the chromatographic process, within which they experience a shear stress and dilution. Also after incubating OspC proteoliposomes in serum at 37 \u00b0C, we demonstrated the stability of the metallochelating bond linking the protein to the liposomal surface [ 37 ] . In fact, in vivo fate of liposomes after the intradermal application is different from the situation after intravenous injection. First, dilution of proteoliposomes after intradermal application is not so rapid and second, the ratio of tissue fl uid proteins to proteoliposomes is more favourable to proteoliposomes owing to their relatively high concentration at the site of application. In the case of another route of application -intradermal -the fl ow rate of tissue fl uid within intradermal extracellular matrix is even lower in comparison with muscle tissue or blood vessels. This fact is often overlooked. The stability of metallochelating bond probably depends also on the character of the particular protein. It was shown that Ni-NTA3-DTDA liposomes (containing three functional chelating lipid) with single-chain Fv fragments (anti CD11c) bound onto the liposomal surface were able to target dendritic cells in vitro as well as in vivo. The application of Ni-NTA3-DTDA probably endows the metallochelating bond with a higher in vivo stability [ 63 ] , but this improved stability did not infl uence higher immunogenicity [ 64 ] . Generally, metal ions, physicochemical character of the metallochelating lipids, and their surface density belong to the factors that could be optimised to get a required in vivo stability and therefore strong immune response.",

This study showed that after 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, more than 60 % of rOspC was still associated with liposomes. Based on this data, therefore, the half-life of rOspC proteoliposomes in serum was estimated to be at least 1 h.

A major functional criterion commonly used for the evaluation of various new adjuvants involves their ability to stimulate the innate immunity cells. This would include engaging other PRRs and the co-receptors and intracellular adaptor signalling proteins with which they are associated. PAMPs and their derivatives are utilised by adjuvant developers to harness the power of innate immunity to channel the immune response in a desired direction. Based on the identifi cation of several TLRs and PAMPs recognised by them, various PAMP agonists were tested as adjuvants. Examples of TLR-PAMP-specifi c interaction include bacterial or viral unmethylated immunostimulating CpG oligonucleotides interacting with TLR9 and liposaccharide and its component monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) interacting with TRL4.

Both Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria contain PGN which consists of numerous glycan chains that are cross-linked by oligopeptides. These glycan chains are composed of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) with the amino acids coupled to the muramic acid. Muropeptides are breakdown products of PGN that bear at least the MurNAc moiety and one amino acid [ 73 ] . One of the prominent muropeptides is muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is known since the 1970s. We will deal with this compound in more detail.",

            "text": "Recently, the molecular bases for MDP recognition and subsequent stimulation of the host immune system have been uncovered. Myeloid immune cells (monocytes, granulocytes, neutrophils, and also DCs) possess two types of intracellular receptor for MDP/MDP analogues, namely, NOD2 and cryopyrin (infl ammasome-NALP-3 complex) [ 74 -76 ] . These two receptors recognise MDP/MDP analogues minimal recognition motifs for bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans [ 77 ] . Another recently reported sensor of MDP is cryopyrin (also known as CIAS1 and NALP3), which is a member of the NOD-LRR family [ 74 ] . Cryopyrin is a part of the infl ammasome complex that is responsible for processing caspase-1 to its active form. Caspase-1 cleaves the precursors of interleukin IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, thereby activating these proinfl ammatory cytokines and promoting their secretion. IL-1\u03b2 is known to be a strong endogenous pyrogen induced by MDP. We showed that norAbu-MDP and that norAbu-GMDP analogues were not pyrogenic even at a high concentration, much higher than the concentrations used for vaccination [ 15 , 65 , 66 ] .",

            "text": "The expression of NOD2 in dendritic cells is of importance with respect to the application of MDP analogues as adjuvants. Nanoparticles like liposomes are able to provide a direct codelivery of a danger signal (e.g., MDP) together with the recombinant antigen and therefore to induce an immune response instead of an immune tolerance. This is especially important for weak recombinant antigens or peptide antigens. Clearly, the recognition of MDP by DCs is crucial for the application of MDP analogues as adjuvants. Within the cell, MDP/MDP analogues trigger intracellular signalling cascades that culminate in the transcriptional activation of inflammatory mediators such as the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Liposomes probably play the role of efficient carriers for MDP and its analogues on the pathway from extracellular milieu into the cytosol, where they trigger intracellular signalling cascades that culminate in transcriptional activation of inflammatory mediators such as the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB pathway. Since the discovery and first synthesis of MDP, about one thousand various derivatives of MDP have been designed, synthesised, and tested to develop an appropriate drug for an immunotherapeutic application that would be free of the side effect exerted by MDP. The main side effects of MDP are pyrogenicity, rigor, headache, flue-like symptoms, hypertension, etc. Only several preparations reached the stage of clinical testing and only mifamurtide was approved for the treatment of osteosarcoma [ 77 ] .

Functionalised nanoliposomes facilitate co-delivery of antigen to immune cells (dendritic cells, macrophages and B-cells). Highly oriented protein antigen on the liposomal surface is able to interact with membrane-bound immunoglobulins on B-cells followed by internalisation of whole complex liposomal antigen. Synthetic lipophilic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (norAbuMDP) provides the danger signal via intracellular receptors like NOD2 and NALP-3 to induce innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, glycopeptide part of the molecule exposed on the liposomal surface forms molecular pattern recognised by immune cells and enhancing internalisation of liposomes (Liposomes and immune cells are not in scale)",

            "text": "( a ) Association of protein antigen with liposome. Protein antigen can be associated with liposome by various ways. Membrane protein can be reconstituted in their natural conformation in liposome membrane ( yellow ); lipophilised protein (e.g. palmitoylated protein) can be anchored in lipid membrane by lipidic residue ( red ). Functionalised liposomes can be prepared to facilitate covalent or non-covalent binding of protein onto the surface of liposomes. Selective metallochelating bond is applicable for His-tagged recombinant proteins ( green ) and this non-covalent bond can be transformed to a covalent one via carbodiimide conjugation. All abovementioned examples represent highly oriented binding of protein onto liposomal surface. Covalent coupling of protein onto liposomal surface functionalised by, e.g. reactive maleiimide phospholipid headgroup, leads to random orientation of bound protein. Electrostatic interaction repre-sents another way for association of proteins with liposomes. This association is non-specifi c and relatively labile in biological milieu ( pink ). Molecule of soluble protein can be also sterically entrapped in water compartment of liposome ( blue ). This is of importance especially for peptide antigens and protein antigens intended for direct delivery into the cytoplasm of immune cells to mimic virus-like pathways for antigen processing.
