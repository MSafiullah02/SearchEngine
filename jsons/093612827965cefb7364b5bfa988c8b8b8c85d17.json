Ideally, the mucosal immune response inactivates the foreign protein without injuring the host. Cellular and noncellular mechanisms participate [1] . Gastrointestinal proteolytic enzymes, extremes in pH, and emulsification by bile reduce antigenic potential. The mucin glycoprotein layer, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and epithelial tight junctions impede attachment and passage of foreign proteins. Junctional integrity may be compromised during the perinatal period, inflammation, and food allergy, permitting luminal antigens and pathogens to gain access to the lamina propria. Once the epithelial barrier is breeched, allergens may crosslink with immunoglobin E (IgE), thereby stimulating mast cell degranulation, epithelial fluid, and electrolyte secretion.",

The antigen is taken up by specialized M cells within the intestinal lining and transferred to macrophages and B cells. Portions of the antigen displayed on macrophage membranes stimulate T-helper (Th) cells and activate B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. Later, ingestion of an intact pathogen elicits memory Th cells to produce cytotoxic T cells, which attack infected cells. Memory Th cells also induce a brisk secretion of antibodies by stimulated B cells. Therefore, oral vaccines can be a particularly effective first line of defense against many of the ingested pathogens responsible for gastrointestinal disease.",

Food allergens can be removed from food plants by mutagenesis, gene silencing, or antisense oligonucleotides. Conversely, novel proteins can be expressed in plants to create edible vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology can be used to transfer genes from other organisms to plants. Similar technology has already been used to make human insulin. One method of gene transfer involves coating microscopic metal particles with the desired DNA and accelerating the particles directly into plant cells with a particle gun. Alternatively, the gene of interest can be inserted into the DNA of a bacterial or yeast plasmid. Plasmid-bearing bacteria then transfer recombinant DNA into host plant cells, where the recombinant DNA incorporates into the plant genome. Transfer of the recombinant DNA into the plant cell by either method is followed by plant cell division, eventually yielding a plant with the transferred trait.",

Most other peanut allergens are isoforms of Ara h1, Ara h2, or Ara h3. Prevention of IgE binding to these three antigens is the basis of the experimental hypoallergenic peanut. Linear epitopes predominate rather than conformational structures. This linearity is important because single amino acid substitutions within IgE-binding sites often lead to loss of binding and abrogate the allergic response [6] . In Ara h1, IgE-binding epitopes are near contact points critical to trimer formation. It is not yet known if amino acid substitution made within these epitopes could inadvertently disrupt trimer formation and alter protein function [6] . Ara h3 has been cloned and characterized. Single amino acid changes at criti-cal residues diminished IgE binding [7] . Hypoallergenic peanuts should conserve the flavor, as different proteins confer taste. Effects on the peanut plant biology and use in food processing are under investigation.",

However, soy provides essential nutrition for many infants as well as for populations of all ages from Asia, where it is a food staple. The only treatment remains avoidance of dietary soy, which is challenging, and risks malnutrition. Soy is ubiquitous in food processing globally because of its high nutritional quality, dense protein content, and physical-chemical properties desirable in food preparation. Baby formulas, salad dressing, soy sauce, milk, flour, cereals, grits, and miso are popular soy-based products. Consequently, elimination of dietary soy risks malnutrition, especially in the very young.",

The strongest allergen is Gly m Bd 30K/ P34, a soybean oil-associated glycoprotein of MW 34,000. It is homologous to Der p (or f), the major allergen in house dust and a member of the papain superfamily. It causes allergy in 65% of soy-allergic individuals. Because all domestic and wild soybean varieties naturally contain Gly m Bd 30K/P34, there is no option to selectively cultivate a naturally occurring crop. Herman et al. [10\u2022\u2022] have produced a soybean cultivar in which Gly m Bd 30K/P34 is silenced or not expressed [11] . Although the function of Gly m Bd 30K is unknown, the resulting soybean plants demonstrate normal phenotype, growth, development, and agronomics [10\u2022\u2022] . No other proteins were induced or suppressed, compared with the wild type [10\u2022\u2022] . Analysis with sera from soybean-sensitive individuals confirmed the loss of the Gly m Bd/P34 allergen without induction of new allergens. Alternatively, a mutant soybean line that lacks Gly m Bd 28K and 60K was created by irradiation. Gly m Bd 30K/P34 was then eliminated by physical-chemical separation and enzymatic digestion of soymilk from this line. In a preliminary trial, 80% of soybean-sensitive patients could ingest products prepared from the hypoallergenic soymilk [9] .",

            "text": "Individuals with wheat allergy are intolerant of wheat for different reasons than those with celiac disease. The toxicity of wheat derives from specific seed storage proteins that are classified based on solubility in water (albumins), dilute salt solutions (globulins), aqueous alcohol (gliadins), or dilute alkali or acid (glutenins). Gliadins and glutenins together are referred to as glutens or prolamins. Prolamins are rich in glutamine and proline. Proline confers resistance to proteolysis and results in presentation of intact antigens to the gut immune system. In wheat allergy, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03c9-gliadins, low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits, albumins, and globulins elicit IgE reactivity, but gliadins and glutenins are the most clinically relevant [24] . Wheat allergy is generally transient. Celiac disease is the permanent intolerance to gluten occurring in genetically predisposed individuals. Here, proline not only protects against proteolysis but also enhances T-cell recognition of gluten through changes in conformation, deamidation, and charge favorable to binding. Susceptibility to celiac disease is linked to leukocyte antigens HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. HLA-DQ2/8 binds gluten, facilitated by tissue transglutaminase, and presents gluten to intestinal CD4 + T cells. The T cells proliferate and secrete interferon-\u03b3, resulting in mucosal damage.",

The first strategy relies on the premise that T cells mediate gluten toxicity and that T-cell recognition of gluten is enhanced by proline. Vader et al. [25\u2022\u2022] recently used site-directed mutagenesis to abrogate the T-cell stimulatory response by substitution of a proline in glutenin and gliadin proteins. However, the response was not completely abolished in all T-cell clones tested, suggesting that additional substitutions might be needed or that only some subsets of celiac patients might benefit. Benahmed et al. [20] further note that young children with celiac disease possess more epitopes than adults, and possibly more clustered or repetitive epitopes. Removal of clustered or repetitive epitopes might reveal alternative competitive epitopes. Non-T cell-mediated pathology must also be accounted for. One example is peptide 31-49 in the N-terminus of A-gliadins, which is inherently cytotoxic.",

Disulfide bridges render many allergens impervious to digestion, resulting in the presentation of intact proteins to the distal gut with subsequent immune stimulation. Glutenins and gliadins are sulfur-rich proteins. Thioredoxins occur in animals, plants, and bacteria. In plants, thioredoxin reduces disulfide bonds in small proteins (such as gliadins and glutenins in wheat) to mobilize starch and protein reserves to provide carbon and nitrogen to germinating seeds. In sensitized atopic dogs, thioredoxin mitigates wheat allergy, as determined by skin testing [26\u2022\u2022] . In some patient subsets, however, thioredoxin alone may not completely abrogate wheat allergy, because some significant peptides, such as \u03c9-gliadin, are not reduced due to lack of disulfide bonds [18,26\u2022\u2022] . Even if possible, elimination of all toxic wheat peptides might not be adequate in the event of environmental exposure to (suspected) molecular mimics such as Ad12 adenovirus, which contains an E1b protein that shares homology with \u03b1-gliadin [27] . Lemaux [12] targeted gene expression in grain endosperm, resulting in a 30-fold increase in thioredoxin expression. Further study is needed to determine the degree to which overexpression of thioredoxin alone could alleviate celiac or allergic symptoms, to identify key allergens and patient subpopulations, and to elucidate the role of molecular mimics.",

Bananas provide one fourth of all food calories in western and central Africa and feed tens of millions in Central America and Asia [32] . As a local crop, bananas incur no cost of foreign production and transport. Bananas are eaten raw, thereby avoiding denaturation of recombinant protein by cooking. Even infants can eat bananas. Ripening bananas contain several upregulated genes that may later prove useful for expression of edible vaccines [33] . Because banana trees require years to grow mature fruit, other plant models are being studied first to determine how best to maximize expression of a vaccine antigen in plant tissue. Eventually, a single banana could yield up to 10 vaccine doses, reducing the cost of one dose to less than one cent [34] .

Even asymptomatic people remain at risk for complications, which include duodenal ulcers, gastric carcinoma, pangastritis, atrophic gastritis, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. In developing countries, H. pylori infection produces associated chronic diarrhea, hypochloremia, malnutrition, predisposition to other enteric infections such as typhoid fever or cholera, and impaired growth. This complex clinical scenario reflects the higher frequency and earlier age of infection in these countries, resulting from environmental factors and poverty. Infection usually persists for a lifetime. Longer duration of colonization correlates with greater risk for complications.",

Therefore, mucosal immunization might be the best route to induce local protection against the organism where it resides. Mounting evidence demonstrates that, in the gastrointestinal tract, B cells preferentially home back to the original site of antigen exposure [49] . Furthermore, unlike animals, humans fail to demonstrate adequate IgA antibody secretion after intranasal or rectal administration of H. pylori antigen [49] . These preliminary data suggest that oral or intraintestinal routes might optimize mucosal induction of B-cell responses in the stomach and proximal gut. Another model is a non-H. pylori typhoid oral vaccine (Ty21) used in H. pylori-infected subjects to study T-cell responses. These studies demonstrated that greater than 95% of circulating T cells possess the gastrointestinal mucosal homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27, suggesting that T-cell responses can also be expressed in gastric mucosa, as cited by Svennerholm [50] . Gastric and jejunal immunization in H. pylori-infected humans produced antibody-specific cells that also expressed the gastrointestinal mucosal homing receptor integrin \u03b14\u03b27. Oral immunization induced significantly greater expression of \u03b14\u03b27 by B cells than did subcutaneous immunization. A plant vaccine might further enhance H. pylori antigen delivery compared with current vaccines, which are compromised by denaturation in gastric acid and by inadequate immune response to single-antigen vaccines. A plant vaccine might protect antigens by encapsulation within cell walls or membranes and could serve as a vehicle for delivery of multiple H. pylori antigens.",

Treatment requires 60 days of antibiotics because germination can occur up to 60 days after exposure. Without early intervention, mortality is high. Although anthrax is rare in humans naturally, the threat of biologic warfare warrants mass vaccination. Current vaccines work, but utility is limited by lack of standardization, high cost, repeat dosing, and side effects. Protective antigen (PA) is the primary immunogenic component. Once bound to mammalian cell surface receptors, PA undergoes cleavage and activation, which facilitates binding to edema factor or lethal factor to form edema toxin and lethal toxin, which are then transported into the host cytoplasm. Cell lysis, toxic shock, and death ensue. Vaccination would obviate disease expression by interfering with PA binding to mammalian cells [52] . Only a fragment of the PA protein is needed to elicit a protective immune response. Recombinant PA has been expressed within spinach plants. Currently, the plants are used as production vehicles to make a safer vaccine. Plants are devoid of human diseases and do not require screening for bacterial toxins or viruses, thus reducing costs. The ideal route of delivery is under investigation (Personal communication, Alexander Karasev, PhD, Thomas Jefferson University) [52, 53] .",

Oral tolerance occurs when ingestion of an antigen suppresses, rather than stimulates, systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune response [4] . In fact, the lack of immune response to commensal bacteria and to food antigens in the gut is thought to be due to oral tolerance. This phenomenon would be counterproductive in an edible plant vaccine intended to provide immunity. However, oral tolerance may provide a means to suppress autoimmunity. Ongoing studies are investigating the technical aspects of creating transgenic plants that express adequate autoantigens to produce vaccines against various autoimmune human diseases and food allergy, as well as ensuring that immunity is stimulated by oral plant-based vaccines intended to combat infectious disease.",

Before implementation, several issues must be clarified: 1) safe use in humans must be established [54\u2022\u2022] ; 2) patient subsets for whom such treatment is appropriate must be identified; 3) all relevant allergens/toxins must be characterized; 4) nutritional quality must be preserved; 5) taste, texture, and temperature properties necessary to food preparation must be retained; and 6) normal agronomics must be maintained. There is much to gain, particularly for highly atopic individuals, who bear the greatest risk of malnutrition due to multiple food allergies or severe reactions. Determination of what components render foods allergenic will contribute to eventual effective therapy. Edible vaccines demonstrate obvious advantages in administration, accessibility, and cost, particularly on a large scale and in developing nations. The key here is to ensure antigenic protein expression that is both adequate and predictable to elicit an effective protective immune response. The eventual elucidation of the molecular biology of humans, food allergens, and pathogens will clarify key interactions and appropriate therapeutic modalities-some of which may be the food we eat.",
