Epidemic models relying on the incidence rate of new cases for forecasting epidemic outbreaks have received increasing attention. However, many prior works in this area mostly focus on the application of the traditional SIR model and disregard the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV, exceptionally the infectious of undiagnosed cases. Here, we propose a SUIR model based on the classical SIR model object to supervise the effective prediction, prevention, and control of infectious diseases. SUIR model adds a unique U (Undiagnosed) state of the epidemic and divides the population into four states: S (Susceptible), U (Undiagnosed), I (Infectious and Uninfectious), and R (Recovered). This approach enables us to predict the incidence of 2019-nCoV effectively and the clear advantage of the model accuracy more reliable than the traditional SIR model.",

Local health authorities identified a novel coronavirus, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, which is the third human cross-infection of coronavirus in 30 years, causing global health concerns. Chinese government took extraordinary measures, first in Wuhan and then in 12 other Chinese cities, to control the epidemic by closing markets and imposing blockades [1] . The disease has now spread globally, including cases confirmed in 187 Countries [2] . Depending on the statistics of the World Health Organization, by the end of March 2020, the Global region was 750890 confirmed cases, and 36405 cases died [3] . Global countries are issue policies to control the 2019-nCoV spread and provide financial support and health rescue. Therefore, predicting the future growth trend of the epidemic situation performs a vital function in measuring the large scale epidemic situation [4] .",

            "text": "Mathematical and Empirical models have been widely adopted in the field of the epidemic, which adequately illus-trates the transmission speed, spatial range, transmission path, and dynamic mechanism of infectious diseases [5] . Depending on the categories of infectious diseases, conventional infectious disease models divide into SIR, time delay SIR, and SEIR model [6, 7, 8] . Subsequently, there are many applications based on the epidemic model. Huo and Zhao considered birth and death rates on heterogeneous complex networks, which proposed a fractional SIR model and obtain results that when the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, the disease can disappear [9] . A detailed study of the T-SIR (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model by Ottar et al. [10] exposed the epidemic cycle and the outbreak of measles. A significant SIR model on the subject was presented by Jiang and Wei [11] , which established the existence of Hopf bifurcations at the endemic equilibrium. Analysis of the SIR model involved with nonlinear incidence rate and time delay was proved that the underlying reproductive number R 0 > 1, the system is permanent [12] . McCluskey further developed a SIR model of disease transmission with delay and nonlinear incidence on [12] , which used a Lyapunov functional shown the global dynamics are fully determined [13] . A qualitative study by Li et al. [14] identified A threshold \u03c3 to determines the outcome of the disease on the SEIR model of infectious disease transmission. Smith et al. applied a latent period, excess death of the infected, and a standard incidence on the SEIR epidemic model to identify the reproduction number \u03b8 [15] . However, these techniques not considered the transmission characteristics of epidemics, such as undiagnosed infectiousness. It is thus critical to assess the effects of undiagnosed states on the epidemic progression for the benefit of global expectation. This paper proposes a Susceptible-Undiagnosed-Infected-Removed (SUIR) Model and applies the simplex algorithm on the historical 14-day incidence data to fit \u03b2 and \u03b3 of parameters, and predict the number of infected and removed (including cured and dead) in the next t (per day). We also confirmed our model prediction combining with a pretraining R 0 [16] and Wuhan R 0 approaches that was addressed the challenging to initialize the susceptible population of the traditional infectious disease model. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the SUIR epidemic model is formulated. In Section 3, the properties of the database are studied, the basic Hyperparameters are given, the reliability of the analytic solution and prediction error are illustrated. In Section 4, some statistical inferences and model results are discussed. Some conclusions are summarized in Section 5.",

            "text": "Kermack-McKendrick [6] proposed the system dynamic (Susceptive-Infective-Removal, SIR) model, which describes the transmission process of infectious diseases through a quantitative relationship to the transmission mechanism of general infectious diseases, analyzed the change rule of the number of infected cases and reveals the growth trend of infectious diseases. SIR model divided into three categories population, which include Susceptible (S), Infectious (I), and Removed (R). Based on the research of Kermack and McKendrick [6] , Beretta and Takeuchi [7] further developed their theories and proposed a time delay SIR model. Cooke and Driessche [8] investigated the incubation period in the spread of infectious diseases, introduced \"Exposed, E,\" and proposed a time delay model. Depending on the above SIR model of infectious diseases, which were similar to the 2019-nCoV epidemic. This paper focuses on applying the SIR model as a fundamental hypothesis. The traditional SIR model is based on the SI model [17] to consider the recovery process of patients further and incorporates two critical parameters, including the infection rate (\u03b2) and the proportion coefficient (\u03b3). Due to the characteristics of the 2019-nCoV, the traditional SIR model without including a unique U state (undiagnosed). Therefore, we inject the state of U (undiagnosed) into the SIR model and propose the SUIR model to effectively track the spread trend of the epidemic situation and predict the future infection population.",

In this regard, \u03c3 determines the spread of infectious diseases, which R 0 < 1 / \u03c3 represents the transmission is limited [22] . Our study generally supports [6] and [22] speculations; we believe the fluctuation of \u03b2 and \u03b3 indicates the epidemic infectivity. Our results in Table IV compares an overview of Hyperparameters in seven countries, Italy, Iran, France, and Germany have higher \u03b2 than other countries, indicating that 2019-nCoV more infectious in these countries. In addition, the most obvious finding to emerge from the analysis is that \u03b3 of the United States located at a lower level than other countries, indicating that confirmed cases in the United States have a postponed treatment period than in other countries. Another important finding was that Iran has a low level of \u03b5, which suggests there is a higher risk of undiagnosed infections.

These experiments confirmed that our prediction model could precisely predict the number of infected and recovered individuals in 2019-nCoV under the database of [20] and [21] with a low error rate. The evidence from this study suggests that utilizing R 0 [16] to predict the future trend of susceptible individuals, it has a significant effect observed from the model. If global countries can adopt the same management measurements as Wuhan and consider the U state of patients, the 2019-nCoV epidemic will have a high probability of controlled under our deterministic model. The most important limitation lies in the fact that until we complete this study, the 2019-nCoV outbreak in some countries, such as the United States, has not recorded the outbreak stage. A further study could assess the long-term effects of recovery cases on infectiousness. In the future, it will be essential to explore the potential use of complex infectious disease models.",
