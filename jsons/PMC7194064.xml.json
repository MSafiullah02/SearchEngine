Without the benefit of modern technology, data keeping was poor, making it difficult to have accurate mortality and morbidity figures; but even then, estimates suggest that the flu killed 1% to 3% of its victims, with the mortality rate reaching 10% in some communities [[1], [2], [3]]. While a 1991 report [3] put the death toll in the range of 24.7\u201339.3 million, and related morbidity estimates between 25% and 90%, recent publications suggest that 50\u2013100 million died as a result of the pandemic [1,4].",

Further raising the level of fear are the portentous economic consequences, which has risen to hitherto unimaginable heights and continues to worsen. That some of the world's largest economies\u2014the US, China, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain South Korea and Switzerland\u2014rank among the worst hit countries, cast a dark shadow on the future of the world as we know it. These developments call for immediate mobilization of every available tool to fight the disease. A frantic search for effective treatments is underway to stem the pandemic and give hope to billions quarantined\u2014willingly or unwillingly\u2014worldwide. However, the world continues to race against time given the rate of spread and the long period usually required to develop effective vaccines.",

This paper suggests that phototherapy, a seemingly forgotten treatment for bacterial and viral infections, has immense potential to reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and similar coronavirus infections, particularly in view of recent developments in the field. Further, it reviews contemporary evidence for this assertion, and offers suggested ways that modern healthcare may integrate readily available inexpensive light technologies in its stash of clinical tools for patients with COVID-19 and other infections.",

In the case of the 1918 flu, overcrowding in poorly lit and poorly ventilated enclosures raised associated risks of infection, a major reason that the City of Boston was badly hit by the flu until exposure to sunlight was introduced [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. By one anonymous editorial account [9], the Massachusetts State Health Department found sunlight therapy to be \u201cthe most valuable factor in reducing mortality,\u201d decreasing fatality of hospitalized patients from 40% to 13%, boosting flu immunity among physicians and nurses, and overall, besting the outcome of vaccines, which, then, were in their early stages of development [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. The benefit of exposure to the healing rays of the sun was so obvious that it became a common form of treatment against tuberculosis\u2014another respiratory disorder, as well as wound infections, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, rickettsia, depression, jaundice, and a host of other diseases [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. Indeed, records indicate that across North America, many healthcare facilities built sunrooms to which patients were wheeled for sun therapy, then known as heliotherapy [11]. Written accounts of the successes of heliotherapy abound, and as the treatment became popular, it was adapted to include treatment with various lamps [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19]].",

Between 1896 and 1901, he treated as many as 804 patients with skin tuberculosis and similar microbial infections at his Medical Light Institute, achieving 83% cure rate [20,21]. The Finsen lamp became widely popular and was adopted in most of Europe and North America, earning Finsen the Nobel Prize in 1903. Finsen himself acknowledged the healing power of sunlight but erroneously assumed that his lamp took advantage of the UV spectrum of radiation. It is quite conceivable that his pioneering work spurred many in the healthcare industry to use sunlight to treat victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic and beyond. To date, studies continue to extol the susceptibility of viruses to rays emanating from the sun [11,16].",

A popular ancient Egyptian image clearly shows a family exposing themselves to the healing rays of the sun (Fig. 1\n). Veneration of the sun and acknowledgement of its healing power remains a cultural practice in most of Africa, and early records indicate that the Egyptians treated chronic ulcers successfully by exposing them to sunlight [23,24]. Furthermore, sunbathing was a common practice, not just in ancient Egypt, Babylonia and Mesopotamia, but ancient Greece and Rome [[23], [24], [25], [26]].",

By this time, lamps generating light from quartz, mercury vapor and other sources were built and used to treat acne, psoriasis, syphilis, leprosy, and pellagra, among others [11,17,25]. Three years later, Finsen began to use filtered sunlight to treat lupus vulgaris and through careful documentation published his Nobel-winning work, in 1901. The use of lamps and other artificial light sources to treat skin diseases continued well into the second half of the 20th century, but was quickly overtaken by easy availability of potent antibiotics, which became popular for their quick results and ease of use [11,25].",

Today, photobiomodulation, which takes advantage of the photochemical effects of low power lasers, LEDs and other monochromatic sources of light to treat various diseases and ailments, has evolved scientifically, allowing evidence-based practice. This development now enables clinicians and others to exploit the specific effect of each wavelength or spectrum of light for treatment purposes. Detailed below are several studies, which show that we do not need UV to kill bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, and that safer wavelengths adjacent to UV, such as violet or blue light, are antimicrobial against microorganisms. Furthermore, evidence shows that red and near infrared light have immense therapeutic value as well, and can be effective in treating a range of ailments, including the respiratory complications of coronavirus disease.",

We now know that light in the blue 400\u2013470 nm range is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria [[23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]] and has the potential to mitigate opportunistic bacterial infections associated with COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. Furthermore, as detailed below, laboratory experiments show that red and near infrared light, with wavelengths approximately in the range of 600\u2013700 nm and 700\u20131000 nm respectively, have the potential to reduce lung inflammation and fibrosis, and hence acute respiratory disorder syndrome, a major cause of death in every coronavirus pandemic, including the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as a part of the ongoing effort to mobilize every clinical tool with the potential to alleviate the disease and minimize its spread, these recent studies offer compelling reasons to explore the potential effects of various spectra of light in reducing secondary bacterial infections associated with the disease, and the possibility of suppressing COVID-19 and other viral infections.",

Thus, when M\u00f8ller et al. measured the radiation transmitted through the Finsen lens systems, and the absorption of the stain solution filters in the lamps relative to the lamp's effect on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, they found that the lens and filters absorbed UV wavelengths below 340 nm [59]. Moreover, the methylene blue solution used to absorb the heat generated by the system also blocked the transmission of wavelengths below 340 nm, as well as light in the 550\u2013700 nm range; thus, allowing predominant transmission of light in the UV-A and violet/blue range [57]. Furthermore, the fluorescence of M. tuberculosis shows the presence of endogenous porphyrins, known to absorb blue light and engender the production of reactive oxygen species and bacterial suppression, not UV absorption [39,[46], [47], [48],[60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]].",

Atmospheric ozone substantially absorbs solar UV rays, allowing transmission of violet/blue light to the surface of the earth. Indeed, the peak transmission at the surface of the earth is in the blue region, and together with violet light, is 10 times more than the amount of UV reaching the surface of the earth [80]. Given the absorption of violet blue light by most microbes and the resulting bactericidal effect, it seems reasonable to attribute a good proportion of the sun's environmental sanitization power to the violet blue spectrum of radiation, and not UV as many assert.",

The first and most well-grounded of which is that blue light triggers endogenous bacterial chromophores such as porphyrins, flavins, NADH and other photosensitive receptors to produce reactive oxygen species, which in adequate amount results in cell death [39,[46], [47], [48], [49], [50],[64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]]. Indeed, porphyrins with absorption peaks in the 405 to 470 nm range have been identified in microbial cells [39,[46], [47], [48], [49], [50],[64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]]. In three recent papers [[34], [35], [36]], we took advantage of this theory by timing in vitro irradiation of P. acnes and MRSA to coincide with periods of abundant endogenous porphyrins and hence elicit maximal bacterial suppression. The outcome was impressive. The dominant chromophores in P. acnes and MRSA emit red light with peak emission between 612 and 660 nm when excited with blue/violet light [36,46,47,64]. Thus, by monitoring the fluorescence\u2014red glow\u2014emitted by both bacteria, we were able to correlate bacterial kill rate with quantitated amounts of remnant bacterial colonies. Not only did it show bacterial suppression, it revealed that their red fluorescence diminished as bacterial colonies were depleted and vice versa [36], further affirming the theory that porphyrins play a major role in antimicrobial blue light treatment.",

Our recent electron microscopic study affirms this finding. It shows that even at a sub-lethal dose level, treatment with pulsed blue 450 nm light disrupts the structural architecture of MRSA cell membrane and its internal organelles. The third and fourth mechanisms of action, deserving further investigation and affirmation are that blue light alters A-DNA [82], and upregulates prophage genes to promote bacteria kill [83].",

They found that the treatment reduced collagen production and the number of inflammatory cells in the alveoli, decreased interstitial thickening, and static as well as dynamic pulmonary elasticity. Further, cultures of pneumocytes and fibroblasts obtained from the animals showed downregulation of pro-inflammatory cells and collagen deposits in the lungs [86]. Another study of the same murine model showed that infrared 780 nm light reduced inflammation and collagen deposits in the lungs of mice, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated the secretion of IL-10 from fibroblasts and pneumocytes. Moreover, it significantly reduced total lung TGF\u03b2 [87]. Taken together, these early results suggest that red and near infrared light have the potential to reduce some of the critical complications of coronavirus infections, i.e., pulmonary inflammation and lung fibrosis. The preliminary nature of these results and the need for improved experimental methods and data reporting should not diminish their significance; rather it should draw attention to another spectrum of light that may be beneficial in the ongoing fight against coronavirus diseases that seems to challenge healthcare systems worldwide.",

The rapid spread of COVID-19 and its clear capacity to kill on a massive scale obviously justify deployment of treatments that seem to work, even though their underlying mechanisms are not clear. Thus, given the potential capacity of red and near infrared light to reduce the life-threatening respiratory complications of COVID-19, it goes without saying that every effort should be made to advance the work so that an effective therapy can be fashioned from the body of research work achieved to date. It will be a wise investment to urgently investigate these initial results clinically, and not wait for another deadly coronavirus pandemic to remind us of the inherent potential of light as a therapeutic tool. The urgency of this call is heightened by recent clinical results, which indicate that patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and others with bronchial asthma and allergy improved significantly following treatment with light [91,92].",

Light has been shown to inactivate baculoviruses [93] and prolonged exposure to blue light in the 420\u2013430 nm range inactivates leukemia virus [94]. One may argue that baculoviruses are confined to invertebrates and are not known to replicate in humans; but the fact that COVID-19 traversed species barrier to humans [84] is a cause to worry. One or more of the 76 species of baculoviruses could mutate to survive and replicate in human hosts, more so because shrimps consumed by humans and mosquitoes that suck human blood are among their 600 or more invertebrate hosts. These prospects make urgent the need to intensify efforts to test the effect of blue light on common viruses, including COVID-19. Further, that light in the visible spectrum constitutes the basis for photodynamic treatment of plasma to inactivate several viruses, including herpes simplex and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [[95], [96], [97]], offers strong reason to suggest that blue light\u2014particularly pulsed blue light, which recent reports have shown to be 40 to 100 times more potent than continuous wave blue light [[33], [34], [35]]\u2014has great potential to inactivate coronaviruses.",

In this recent study, broad spectrum light\u2014mimicking sunlight\u2014was tested on aerosolized influenza virus at 20% and 70% relative humidity, while the decay constant and half-life of the virus were measured as indices of survival. The results showed that relative humidity had no effect. The simulated sunlight alone significantly inactivated the virus, resulting in 0.29 \u00b1 0.09 min\u22121 decay constant and a half-live of approximately 2.4 min compared to non-irradiated controls, which had 0.02 \u00b1 0.06 min\u22121 decay constant and 31.1 min half-life. The resulting 93% increase in decay constant and the concomitant 92.3% decline in half-life due to light is impressive. This is supported by news report of a recent US Department of Homeland Security study, which showed that exposure to the sun kills COVID-19\u2014a more virulent form of the common influenza virus [99]. These recent developments buttress the suggestion that blue light, in particular, pulsed blue light, which recent reports have shown to be 40 to 100 times more potent the commonly available continuous wave blue light [[34], [35], [36]], has great potential to inactivate COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, in addition to suppressing related opportunistic bacterial infections. This recent finding further elevates the urgency to explore the potential of blue light as an antiviral agent. When convincing clinical results prove that blue light is antiviral, in addition to being antibiotic against coronavirus opportunistic bacteria, it would be a revolutionary paradigm shift, considering the ubiquity of low cost blue light emitting devices and the low risk involved in terms of safety. Moreover, the potential to disinfect equipment, the environment and spaces difficult to sanitize with common disinfectants, is huge.",
