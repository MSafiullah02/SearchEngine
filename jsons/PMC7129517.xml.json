Litter size was defined as the total number of kittens (live or stillborn) in each litter at parturition. It was treated as a continuous variable and a linear regression model was used to test the significance of possible explanatory variables. The probability of dystocia, on the other hand, was modelled using logistic regression. The probability of stillbirth and of kitten mortality for the first 12 weeks post partum were both investigated using negative binomial regression. The exposure variables in these models were the total number of kittens (live or stillborn) in the litter and number of live kittens at partus, respectively. In all, the potential covariates considered for inclusion in the initial models were: breed, season, age of queen, litter size, presence of stillborn kittens in the litter and caesarean section. For breed comparisons, the Norwegian Forest Cat was chosen as the baseline breed because it was one of the numerically largest breeds, mesocephalic, and without marked conformational variations.",

The three most common breeds in the survey were those most common in Sweden: Birman, Norwegian Forest Cats and Persian.

Even if only some cats in a group can roam freely, these can in turn infect the indoor cats. However, FIV is not a common infection in Sweden, and in this study no breeder had a cat tested positive for FIV the previous year. Only one breeder had a case of FeLV diagnosed in the cattery. It should be emphasised, that is not known to what extent breeders in the present study have tested their cats for FIV and FeLV. Outdoor cats are at risk of acquiring FeLV in endemic areas, especially when young, but the present study indicates that this infection route is not a major risk for breeding cats. FeLV can also be a problem in indoor cats and especially breeding animals. When introducing new cats into a household, or when mating with cats from other catteries, testing against FIV and FeLV is advisable.16\n",

Even if infections with C felis can be treated successfully, extended treatment periods are required to eliminate the infection.21 As most cases of ocular infections in catteries never get an aetiological diagnosis, it can be assumed that several cats infected with C felis are not receiving appropriate treatment, increasing the opportunity for spread of C felis and an endemic situation in catteries.

Although several precautions are usually undertaken to avoid spread of infections, it is an occasion with a concentration of many cats that can be subclinically infected and potentially excreting the infectious agent. In addition, when signs of infectious diseases occur, cat owners are prone to search for association with a special occasion or event, such as a show. Ectoparasites can spread, but less than 1% of breeders reported acquiring dermatophytosis after a show the previous year and ectoparasite infections were generally uncommon. In contrast, an average of 10.4% of breeders reported conjunctivitis in cats after shows, with a significant variation among breeds, and 14.6% re-ported other upper respiratory signs after shows. Clinical signs might be due to reactivation of latent infections, due to new infections acquired, due to non-infectious causes and may or may not be related to showing. Due to the brachycephalic anatomical conformation of Persian and Exotic breeds, they are also more prone to ocular problems and dyspnoea.23, 24 As the diagnoses in the present survey were made by the owners, this might result in an overestimation of reports of conjunctivitis and rhinitis in these breeds. On the other hand it can be argued that owners are used to these clinical signs, and regard them as normal for the breed.",

Breed did not have a significant independent effect on dystocia, indicating that factors other than breed are more important risk factors for dystocia, as previously suggested by Sparkes et al.15 Both litter size and presence of stillborn kittens were not only associated with dystocia but also differed significantly among breeds.",

The percentage of stillborn kittens increased with larger litter size, as previously described,15 and also differed significantly among breeds. In Birman, British Shorthair and Persian/Exotic the percentage of stillborn kittens was over 10%. It has been suggested that a high proportion of stillborn kittens in Persians is related to a disproportionately high braincase that causes mechanical obstacles during the birth process.24 The mean percentage of stillborn kittens, 9.7, in the present study is slightly higher than in previous studies.10, 15, 30 Kitten mortality including stillborn kittens and mortality from week 1 to 12 was 18.1%, and the percentage surviving kittens at 12 weeks thus 81.9%. These values are in the same range as previously reported.10, 15 In the cat colony studied by Root et al,30 overall kitten mortality was higher, and only 70.1% of the kittens had survived by 8 weeks of age. As in previous studies, the majority of kitten mortality in the present study occurred during the first week after birth. As for stillbirths, kitten mortality post partum differed significantly among breeds. In Oriental Shorthair/Siamese and Persian/Exotic it was over 10%.",

Although Swedish breeding catteries are of moderate size, with a mean of six cats, FIP is a challenge to breeders: 8% had experienced this fatal disease. Despite this, measures to control FCoV infection are rarely undertaken. Breed affects several outcomes, both infectious (prevalence of conjunctivitis and URTD) and breeding parameters (litter size, stillborn kittens and kitten mortality). A careful breeding strategy should, therefore, enable both a reduction of infectious disease and an improvement of reproductive outcome.",
