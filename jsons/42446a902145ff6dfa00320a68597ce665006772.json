Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to identify HRV, and the HRV-positive samples were used for sequencing analysis and to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. HRV was identified in 198 samples (42.2%), and the VP4/VP2 region was successfully amplified in 151 (76.3%). HRV-A was identified in 78 samples (51.6%), HRV-B in 14 (9.3%) and HRV-C in 59 (39.1%). Forty-seven (31.1%) of the children with HRV infection were aged <1 year, 71 (47.0%) were aged 1-3 years, and 33 (21.9%) were aged \u22654 years. Blast and phylogenetic analyses showed that the HRV strains were closely related to a total of 66 reference genotypes, corresponding to 29 HRV-A, 9 HRV-B and 28 HRV-C strains. Nucleotide variability was 37% between HRV-A and HRV-B, 37.3% between HRV-A and HRV-C, and 39.9% between HRV-B and HRV-C. A number of sequences clustered with known serotypes and, within these clusters, there were strains circulating during several seasons. The most frequently detected genotypes were HRV-A78 (n=17), HRV-A12 (n=9) and HRV-C2 (n=5). This study shows that, although it is mainly associated with HRV-A, pediatric CAP can also be diagnosed in subjects infected by HRV-C and, more rarely, by HRV-B. Moreover, a large number of genotypes may be involved in causing pediatric CAP and can be different from year to year. Although the prolonged circulation of the same genotypes can sometimes be associated with a number of CAP episodes in different years.",

However, most of these studies were carried out in a single year and involved a relatively small number of patients, and only a few analysed specific LRTIs.

The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the neighbour-joining method and parameters selected by the MEGA model test program. Branch support was assessed by means of bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Genotypes were assigned on the basis of their clustering with known prototype reference strains present in GenBank. The genetic distances between and within HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C were tested using the MEGA program and compared by means of Student's t-test.

The presence of a virus in the nasopharynx of a child with CAP does not necessarily mean that it is the etiological agent of the disease because it may only indicate a coincidental upper airways infection, or be due to a carrier state or the prolonged shedding of a pathogen that caused a previous infection. This may be particularly important in the case of RVs because a number of epidemiological studies have shown that they can be found in the respiratory secretions of 12-22% of asymptomatic subjects [16, 17] . However, in our study population, we found HRV as a single agent in about 60% of the children in which this pathogen was identified. This strongly suggests that it was the cause of the CAP diagnosed in many of our study patients, particularly in those in whom very low values of WBC counts and CRP were found.",

[21] and Linsuwanon et al. [22] , who studied patients with LRTIs and found that HRV-B was predominant when CAP was diagnosed. However, the diagnosis of CAP in the last two studies was not always radiographically confirmed and this could have affected the results. We detected HRVs more frequently in children aged <1 year (31.1%) and in those aged 1-3 years (47%), than in those aged \u22654 years (21.9%), as has been reported in other studies [18, 23] . In terms of species, HRV-A was more frequently detected than HRV-C in children aged 1-3 and \u22654 years, although a recent study in Thailand found that HRV-C was the most frequent species in children with LRTIs in the same age groups [24] . In our study the circulation of HRV was evaluated only during the winter and spring months. This means that data do not indicate the real circulation of HRV species during the whole year. However, ours is the first study defining the circulation of HRV species and genotypes in children with CAP that is based on such a large number of samples collected over a 5-year observation period, which is significantly longer than in other studies [19, [25] [26] [27] [28] and can give a precise information on the circulation in time of the different HRV species. .",

However, in the absence of a VP1 sequence, the putative new types are considered provisionally assigned. Our data show that a large number of genotypes can circulate during each observation period, and that some can circulate in more than one year and simultaneously in different geographic areas. This is clearly shown by the similarity between the Italian HRV-A strains identified in the present study and those found in Spain [31] and Jordan [32] during 2008, and the fact that we also found the genotypes most frequently detected in Sweden by Sansone et al.: A78, A12, A56, A10, C9 and C43 [29] . Considering only the 2009-2010 season, genotypes A12, A40, A89 and C2 found in this study were also found in a study carried out in France and involving a population similar to ours [33] . Furthermore, HRV-A12 was the most common genotype found in children with a primary diagnosis of viral CAP in Beijing, China, during the 2007-2008 season [34] .",

These may vary from year to year although the prolonged circulation of the same genotypes can sometimes be associated with a number of CAP episodes in different years. This could be the case of HRV-A78-like and HRV-A12-like strains, which were the most frequently found in this study.",
