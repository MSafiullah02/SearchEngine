The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) increased the number of viral findings, revealed that multiple viral aetiological findings are common, confirmed that viruses are often found in nonsymptomatic children and even detected new viruses (2) (3) (4) . Rhinoviruses were discovered in 1956, but the slow, nonsensitive viral culture was the only diagnostic method for decades, and the development of antigen or antibody assays did not help, as there are now more than 100 rhinovirus serotypes. In the 2000s, PCR highlighted the role of rhinoviruses in paediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (1) and identified other agents, such as the metapneumovirus, bocavirus and certain coronaviruses (2, 3) .
