            "text": "Undoubtedly the earliest detection of odorous volatiles being produced by microbes would have been from the process of putrefaction. Putrefaction is known to occur when heterotrophic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and yeast) utilize organic material from once-living tissues (plants and animals, or their products, such as milk or sewage) as a source of carbon-energy. This \u2018feedstock\u2019 has high nutritional value and the presence of easily utilizable polymeric carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, fats, and proteins. Microbes breakdown these compounds using various hydrolytic enzymes (see figure 1 and table 1) and resultant products are utilized by heterotrophic species as both a source of building blocks for the synthesis of their own structural polymers (anabolism), but most frequently by the main route of catabolism, as a source of biochemical energy (NADH and ATP) obtained either from aerobic respiration (O2), anaerobic respiration (using end-terminal electron acceptors such as NO3\u2212 or SO42\u2212 in place of oxygen), or fermentation. Depending on the nature of the microbes and the local physicochemical conditions (i.e. types of organic matter, pH, salt concentration and temperature) the putrefaction process will produce VOC gases, including many that are odiferous. This includes ammonia, volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), indole and certain volatile amines, (including putrescine and cadaverine; Statheropoulos et al\n2005), all products of amino acid utilization for catabolism. The amino acids and small peptides are supplied from proteins following hydrolysis and digestion by proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, microbial processes will ultimately produce a complex mixture of VOCs and/or odour depending on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the composition and pH of \u2018feedstock\u2019. For example, carbohydrates do not result in major VOC odours whilst proteins and/or fats result in a variety of foul putrefactive odours (Statheropoulos et al\n2005). In addition, a low pH (<6.0) is thought to allow yeasts and moulds to dominate, whilst a higher pH favours bacteria and the putrefaction processes, which will release foul-smelling VOCs (Mackie 1995), including volatile sulfide compounds (VSC), indoles and amines.",

            "text": "In general, when complex organic compound mixtures (including those within host organisms) are exposed to complex, highly diverse mixed cultures of microorganisms, then a well described theoretical sequence of ecological shifts (succession) and corresponding metabolic \u2018phases\u2019 or stages occur. Aerobes and facultative anaerobes are the first colonizers, with high growth rate and population expansion, giving accelerated reduction of the oxygen concentration and redox. Mixed culture fermentation produces carboxylic acids that may lower the pH enabling aciduric and acidophilic species to gain a selective advantage (e.g. Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp.; Wilson 2005). When all small molecular weight, easy to assimilate sugars and amino acids have been fully utilized, hydrolytic mechanisms become induced or relieved of catabolite repression (Magasanik 1961) and microbial biotransformation of polymeric molecules (proteins and glycoproteins) becomes of more marked importance. The general phenomena of catabolite repression (Magasanik 1961) occurs when there is an abundance of small molecular weight (cell-transportable) nutrients (e.g. sugars or amino acids), and is a mechanism by which cells may conserve their energy (e.g. ATP) and amino-acid building blocks by repressing synthesis of enzymes involved in hydrolytic depolymerization of large molecules outside the cell. The enzymes are thus redundant under small molecule replete nutrient conditions. Even asaccharolytic species (e.g. Porphyromonas spp.) produce little proteolytic activity when grown in the presence of low molecular weight peptides and amino acids, compared to much higher amounts when grown in the presence of proteins (Minhas et al\n1991).",

The pH may then start to increase, as carbon dioxide is lost and amines and ammonia accumulate. Physicochemical conditions now favour anaerobic proteolytic species, especially strict anaerobes (e.g. Clostridium spp.). Volatile short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) will be produced through primary fermentation, producing mainly lactate, acetate, propionate and ethanol from the main carbohydrates, but is ultimately replaced by secondary fermentation, producing e.g. n-butyrate, propionate, propanol, n-butanol, and n-hexanol (Mackie 1995). The volatile SCFAs propionate and n-butyrate are produced by Propionibacterium spp. and Butyribacterium spp. respectively, as end-products of central metabolism of sugars, and additional amounts are produced by fermentation of amino acids by species such as Clostridium and Fusobacterium (MacFarlane and MacFarlane 1995). If methanogens are present (e.g. within the gastrointestinal tract) and the hydrogen partial pressure becomes sufficiently high, then acetate will be converted to methane (Jones et al\n1987). Hence, the specific microbial succession (and associated microcosm metabolism) that occurs at a given anatomical location will impact on the volatiles produced.",

However, the human microflora is exposed to a variety of physicochemical environments at different anatomical locations, resulting in diverse but often restricted microbial ecology. For example, the diversity of species found in the large intestine of man and mammals is a strongly selected group that can withstand bile secretion and other physicochemical conditions of the gut (Wilson 2005). Skin presents a hostile environment because of its low water activity, salt content, pH, and host defence molecules, but for those strains able to tolerate these conditions easily available nutrients are present, including sweat and sebum (Roth and James 1988). In reality, the predominant microbial flora at a given anatomical site is relatively specialized, and the authors postulate that the VOC profile is therefore likely to be more characteristic of the metabolic pathways favoured by the predominant groups of organisms present (which in turn is reliant on the substrate precursors available).",

Following digestion/depolymerization, carbon-energy monomers (e.g. sugars) are metabolized into pyruvate being an intermediate in several metabolic pathways. Acetate is produced via pyruvate metabolism by many species of microorganisms, as either major or minor components of other metabolic products. Butyrate is also produced as a major end-product of pyruvate fermentation in a small number of different species of obligate anaerobe (Clostridium spp., Roseburia spp. and Eubacterium spp.; Louis and Flint 2009), which are commonly isolated from the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract of man and animals, as well as from infected wounds. Alanine can react with \u03b1-ketoglutarate to form pyruvate and glutamate, and is then again metabolized by a whole variety of routes depending on the species of microbe, and the availability of different types of end-terminal electron acceptors. Amino acids may be deaminated, decarboxylated or transaminated depending on type.

Trimethylamine is produced by many species of bacteria from the breakdown of choline or trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) found in meat, eggs, fish and certain vegetables (Brassica) (Groninger 1959, Yamada 1967). In fish (post mortem), TMAO is reduced by bacteria (notably Gram-negative rods) to trimethylamine (TMA), which gives rise to the characteristic off-flavour and odour of marine fish in the early stage of decay (Beatty and Gibbons 1937, Tarr 1954). In humans, TMA is produced from TMAO (in the diet) or from choline, by intestinal bacteria. From the gut, TMA is then absorbed into the bloodstream and is oxidized into odourless TMAO by the liver enzyme flavin mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO3) and excreted into urine. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; fish odour syndrome) is a rare condition caused as a consequence of an autosomal recessive mutation in FMO3, where TMA is excreted into body fluids (including saliva and sweat) and is detected on breath giving rise to persistent or sporadic oral and body malodour (Mackay et al\n2011, Whittle et al\n2007). TMAO levels in the liver may vary for reasons other than TMAU mutation, including hepatic disease, anxiety and stress, diet and menstruation (Mitchell 2005, Shimizu et al\n2007). A strict diet avoiding choline-rich and TMAO containing foods is advised in the management of these cases (Mitchell 2005).",

Ammonium ion production may be balanced by acid production, but if fermentable substrates are in short supply, the pH will tend to increase converting the ammonium ion present into ammonia gas. In strongly neutral buffered environments, the amount of ammonium ion production is probably not high enough to affect large pH changes. However, additional ammonium ion can be produced from the action of microbial urease enzymes on the substrate urea (found in blood, sweat, saliva and other body fluids in addition to urine), producing ammonium and bicarbonate ions (Mobley and Hausinger 1989). Bicarbonate is a weak acid and easily lost into the gas phase particularly when in the presence of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme found in numerous microbial species, (particularly Escherichia coli; Guilloton et al\n1992, Chirica et al\n1997), as well as mammalian species. This allows the pH of these environments to increase and causes production of significant amounts of ammonia gas.",

            "text": "Although hydrogen sulfide is not organic (and so not strictly a VOC), volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) are associated with desulfurization reactions of the sulfur containing amino acids cysteine, cystine and methionine, and plays a central role in the maintenance of a low redox potential (ideal for proteolytic anaerobes). There are two different mechanisms by which microbes produce hydrogen sulfide. One group of microbial species, collectively known as dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), reduce oxyanions of sulfer (SO4, SO3, S2O32\u2212) as terminal electron acceptors, using cytochromes to perform \u2018anaerobic respiration\u2019 (Postgate 1984). In the mammalian oral cavity SRB (e.g. Desulfovibrio spp.) have been detected, but are generally only a small fraction of the total population (Willis et al\n1995), and their presence shows a negative correlation with VSC production and oral malodour in humans (Willis et al\n1999). It is much more likely that the main microbial path to hydrogen sulfide within mammalian host organisms is via desulfurization of amino acids, and also by species that can utilize glutathione or other thiol containing peptides removing the sulfur in the form of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) (Persson et al\n1990). For example, Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative, anaerobic species found in the human oral cavity with a high propensity for producing H2S (Persson et al\n1990). Three or four distinct VSC producing enzymes have been isolated and characterized, including: (1) \u03b1,\u03b2-elimination of L-cysteine to produce H2S, pyruvate and ammonia; (2) \u03b2-elimination of L-cysteine to produce H2S and L-serine; (3) \u03b2-replacement reaction, where two molecules of cysteine condense to produce H2S and L-lanthione (Fukamachi et al\n2002, Yoshida et al\n2010, Yoshida et al\n2011). A fourth mechanism has also been described involving the enzyme L-methionine \u03b3-lyase (which normally catalyses methionine into methylmercaptan). This enzyme will produce H2S when L-methionine is replaced by L-cysteine (Kyosuke et al\n2011).",

The enzyme responsible is tryptophanase (more correctly named as tryptophan indole-lyase; EC4.1.99.1) and it transforms tryptophan into indole, pyruvate and ammonium ion (figure 2, Newton and Snell 1964). Indole has a low volatility coupled with a very low odour threshold. The odour has been described as foul and repellent (Tso and Adler 1974), and due to its low volatility the smell \u2018lingers\u2019 remaining for hours or days (called stench). Indole acts as a cell-to-cell signalling molecule that mediates biofilm formation in various bacteria carrying the gene for tryptophanase (Newton and Snell 1964, Martino et al\n2003, Mueller et al\n2009), as well as affecting the expression of several other genes, including those associated with amino acid metabolism (Wang et al\n2001), multidrug exporters (Hirakawa et al\n2005) and polysaccharide production (Mueller et al\n2009). The enzyme consists of four identical monomers, each containing one molecule of pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP). The PLP molecule forms an aldimine bond with a lysine residue (Ku et al\n2006) and catalyzes the reversible hydrolytic cleavage of L-tryptophan to produce indole and ammonium pyruvate via an \u03b1,\u03b2-elimination mechanism (Snell 1975).\n3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\n\n\\end{document}",

            "text": "For organic acids (including SCFAs) when the pH is above neutral they exist in the ionic dissociated (salt) form and are not volatile, whereas at decreasing pH, a greater proportion of the acid is in the associated (hydrophobic) state, hence more can partition between the liquid and gas phases. For amines, it is the other way round; when the pH is above neutral, amines exist more in their base-form, and it is only in this associated form that the compound can partition into the gas phase. Independent of the effects of pH on VOC phase transitions, pH will also variably affect the production rate of microbial VOCs, e.g. pH inducible amino decarboxylases in bacteria (Viala et al\n2011). Amine production and its role in pH homeostasis in E. coli and Micrococcus lysodeikticus was described nearly 70 years ago by Gale and Epps (1942). The mechanism occurred as a consequence of low pH inducible amino acid decarboxylase enzymes, which acted on amino acids (particularly glutamate, arginine, lysine and ornithine) producing carbon dioxide and free amine base. At low pH, carbon dioxide is lost from the system (especially in the presence of microbial carbonic anhydrase activity) and the overall balance is for the system to increase the pH from acid towards neutrality. More recently it has been shown how enteric bacteria survive exposure to acidic environments, by inducing genes that provide for acid resistance and pH homeostasis (Bearson et al\n1997, Hall et al\n1995). E. coli has three distinct systems for acid resistance: a glucose-catabolite-repressed system and two amino acid decarboxylase-dependent systems (Castanie-Cornet et al\n1999). Glutamate decarboxylase activity was thought to be the most important pathway in E. coli, the product being gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; which is not volatile at ambient temperatures), but interestingly lysine decarboxylase (producing the volatile cadaverine) has been shown to be central to pH homeostasis in Salmonella typhimurium (Park et al\n1996). These systems overlap in ways that protect both growing and non-growing cells from acid stress across a broad range of naturally occurring acidic environments, and can result in pH dependent volatile products.",

Early research studies used the Duclaux method to analyse volatile fatty acids produced by bacteria. This was based on the differential volatility of fatty acids in steam (in essence preparative chromatography), whereby sequential distillate portions could be collected and titrated with alkali to determine the concentration (Richmond 1895). The method was used very effectively to assay for formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid (Zoller and Clark 1920), and was later improved with more refined quantitative chemical analysis of fatty acid fractions (e.g. mercuric chloride method for detection of formic acids; McNair 1933). The detection of volatile compounds has been used for many years as part of bacterial identification systems, for example the imvic (indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, and citrate) system which differentiates coliforms according to their production of indole, acetoin, and mixed acid fermentation products, in addition to their ability to metabolize citrate (MacFaddin 1980). This biochemical approach to the detection of microbial volatiles continues to the present day, for example functionalized nanoporous xerogels are currently being developed for detection of the presence of acetate and indole (Crunaire et al\n2011).",

            "text": "In most modern analytic research laboratories, the detection of microbial volatiles is carried out using gas chromatography (the separation step), and subsequent mass spectrometry, electron capture or flame ionisation detection, which coupled with analytical software enables quantification and identification of VOCs (with high sensitivity and specificity) from a given microbial species or mixed consortia. Early studies on microbial volatiles used direct gas-liquid chromatography (Gorbach et al\n1976, Bogaard et al\n1986), whereby compounds were identified from their retention times, using a flame ionisation detector (Ettre 1993). This requires preparation of whole microbial cultures by chemical extraction, and modified methods were developed to enable direct injection of whole microbial cultures or faeces for detection of anaerobic bacteria (Bricknell and Finegold 1973). The development of \u2018head-space analysis\u2019 of microbial cultures using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) provided more information, was less laborious, and was capable of automation (Larsson et al\n1978a, 1978b, Zechman et al\n1986). In particular, the use of mass spectrometry (via electron ionisation) has enabled qualitative and quantitative detection of microbial volatiles by measuring the mass-charge ratio of charged sample particles. Subsequent software mining of mass spectral libraries (e.g. NIST or Massfinder) then enables identification of the volatiles present based on the sample mass chromatogram produced. However, this analysis should be performed with caution since many related compounds generate similar mass spectra (Schulz and Dickschat 2007), and it has been suggested that the structure of many microbial volatiles is yet to be \u2018unequivocally\u2019 identified (Kai et al\n2009). The application of head-space GC-MS has been shown capable of identifying anaerobes (Julak et al\n2000, Mardh et al\n1981), facultative bacteria, (Zechman et al\n1986), and fungi (Larsen and Frisvad 1995). The headspace gas sampling procedure initially involved simple purge trap approaches using various adsorbent materials (e.g. charcoal, tenax, super Q), but these are thought to preferentially bind certain compounds according to their chemical composition (Kai et al\n2009). Hence, as GC-MS technology has advanced, so has the sampling procedure, and pre-concentration solid phase micro-extraction (SPME; Bojko et al\n2011, Julak et al\n2003) and closed-loop stripping apparatus (CLSA; Hassett and Rohwer 1999) have greatly improved the sampling efficiency. GC-MS does have some disadvantages being relatively expensive and time-consuming, requiring highly skilled operators, and is reliant on the use of internal standards to identify and quantify each VC component. Therefore, although it is largely considered the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 for microbial volatile detection, other analytical approaches have been explored.",

            "text": "A significant development in microbial volatile analysis is soft ionisation mass spectrometry techniques, enabling direct sampling in air. For example, ion mobility mass spectrometry separates and identifies ionized molecules (including VOCs) in the gas phase based on their mobility in a carrier buffer gas, and has enabled rapid determination of microbial volatiles in humid samples (milliseconds to minutes) (Eiceman 2002, Shnayderman et al\n2005). This is a promising technology with real-world applications, but suffers from being unable to differentiate all volatiles within complex samples due to insufficient sensitivity and mass resolution (Smith and Spanel 2005). To address this issue, a new approach to direct, online microbial headspace analysis has emerged in the form of proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and selective ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). These techniques are capable of determining absolute head-space concentrations of VOCs regardless of humidity, and without need for any sample preparation (Mayr et al\n2003, Smith and Spanel 1996, Smith and Spanel 2005). PTR-MS uses protonated water (H3O+) as a chemical ionisation reagent enabling direct and real-time sampling and analysis of sample specimen headspace (Lindinger et al\n1998). This has been used to quantify VOCs emanating from microbial cultures, enabling not only species specific volatile profile discrimination, but also temporal evolution of VOCs during bacterial growth (Bunge et al\n2008, O'Hara and Mayhew 2009). In contrast, SIFT-MS uses multiple reagent ions (H3O+, O2+ and NO+) to perform soft ionisation. The use of three precursor ions enables internal verification of the VOCs detected, making identification more accurate, and enabling discrimination of isomeric and isobaric compounds (Hu and Storer 2008). The sample gas is delivered to the instrument at a constant rate where it is mixed with microwave generated reagent ions within a fast-flowing helium flow tube. The resultant reaction products are separated and counted downstream by quadrupole mass spectrometry, enabling quantitative measurements of complex volatile mixtures (Allardyce et al\n2006a, Smith and Spanel 2005). Accurate identification and quantification of trace gaseous molecules is possible since the reaction time for molecular interactions is predictable within SIFT-MS instruments, being defined by predetermined rate co-efficients of the ion-molecule reactions (Smith and Spanel 1996). This technology has now been successfully applied to microbial headspace analysis (Allardyce et al\n2006a, Allardyce et al\n2006b), being capable of discrimination of bacterial species when coupled with multivariate analysis (Storer et al\n2011, Thorn et al\n2011).",

Sample discrimination is then achieved through pattern recognition algorithms, principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis, cluster analysis or artificial neural networks (Spinelli et al\n2010). These systems have been used successfully in detecting the presence of microbial activity (Spinelli et al\n2010), and to differentiate microbial species by VOC profiling (Pavlou et al\n2002a, 2002b). However, it should be noted that this is not a quantitative approach and cannot identify or provide absolute concentrations of VOCs, relying purely on comparative detection of patterns.",

Laser (absorption) spectroscopy, based on the attenuation of an electromagnetic signal to produce a characteristic adsorption profile, has been used for accurate detection and quantification of volatile compounds. An extensive review already exists on the use of this technology for detection of volatile sulfur compounds, whereby it was concluded that the detection limits (down to ppb) are sufficient for medical applications and could result in the future development of portable and affordable gas sensors (Ciaffoni et al\n2011). Photoacoustic spectroscopy is the acoustic detection of the interaction of absorbed electromagnetic energy (light) with matter. This is based on a modulating excitation source which excites light absorbing gas molecules, subsequent transfer of kinetic energy to surrounding molecules, and generation of a sound wave which is detected by a specially designed microphone and amplifier (Chivukula et al\n2007). This has been successfully used to measure complex VOCs using a spectrally tunable monochromatic radiation source, in combination with a sophisticated data analysis algorithm (Wolff et al\n2011), and represents a highly sensitive and novel approach that could equally be applied to microbial volatile detection.",

            "text": "Human breath will contain VOCs that have originated from more than one source within the respiratory system. Three main VOC sources can be identified: (1) exogenous sources; VOC's inspired from background ambient gases and then expired again, (2) Extra-oral; from microbes further down the respiratory tract (oropharynx, bronchioles), or else blood-circulatory VOC's that enter the lungs and, through gaseous exchange, are removed from the body, and (3) Intra-oral; microbial VOCs from microbial biofilms that are encountered in the oral cavity. Exogenous sources depend on the ambient gases around the time and place of the sample streams, and may include industrial-synthetic sources or else VOCs emitted from plants, animals or microbes in the vicinity of the sample. The other two sources (extra-oral and intra-oral) can be differentiated by comparing lung gas samples (e.g. collected via nose) with samples obtained from the mouth, following a period of \u2018holding\u2019 the gas within the mouth (by breathing through the nose) to allow for phase equilibration with the aqueous phase (typically one or two minutes) and finally sampling the mouth gas after this period. The majority of human subjects with halitosis (80 to 90%) have oral malodour because of microbial activity from biofilms within the oral cavity (Miyazaki et al\n1995). For extra-oral halitosis, (about 5\u201310% of all cases of halitosis), then the majority of patients have blood-borne halitosis (Tangerman and Winkel 2010). Blood-borne halitosis is frequently caused by odorous VSCs, in particular dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3). Extra-oral halitosis can potentially be a manifestation of a more serious disease, for which treatment is much more complicated than for intra-oral halitosis. Potential sources of (non-microbial) halitosis include liver and kidney diseases, metabolic disorders, medications and certain foods (Greenman and Saad 2009), and most of these VOCs are therefore produced by the mammalian system (van den Veld et al\n2007a). It is therefore of utmost importance to differentiate between intra-oral and extra-oral halitosis. For malodour to be perceived as noticeable and unpleasant, the VOCs in question must be well above the threshold concentration for smell detection by the perceiver. The relative \u2018smell\u2019 of a pure compound can be determined by accurate dilution of the VOC in question to the point where a panel of judges can just detect it. The degree of dilution necessary to reach this point is a measure of the olfactory power (pol value) of the compound in question (Greenman et al\n2004). The main unit of measurement (pol by volume) is defined as the negative log of the threshold concentration expressed in volumic or molar fractions, for example, 1 ppm = pol 6, whilst 1 ppb = pol 9 (Devos et al\n1990). Approximate averaged standardized thresholds have been published for a number of compounds (Devos et al\n1990).",

Most reports now agree that the most frequent sources of halitosis exists within the oral cavity. This includes bacterial reservoirs such as the dorsum of the tongue, saliva and periodontal pockets, where anaerobic bacteria degrade sulfur-containing amino acids to produce the foul smelling volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs); especially hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3) (Tonzetich 1971). Figure 3 illustrates the main microbial mechanisms in generation of oral malodour gases. A \u2018generalized\u2019 bacterial cell is shown since no single species can produce all the enzymes, or possesses all the pathways, for changing primary substrates into corresponding volatile compounds. However, collectively there is sufficient diversity of species within the oral cavity such that all pathways usually operate to some degree, the same being true for the diversity of hydrolytic enzymes that change secondary into primary substrates.",

To date, the exact number of different species resident within the oral cavity is unknown, although several attempts have estimated numbers ranging from; 500 species (Moore et al\n1985, Paster et al\n2001), to 600 species (Kazor et al\n2003), and up to 700 species (Aas et al\n2005). Although the actual exact number will probably remain unknown due to the high diversity of resident oral flora, most estimates propose that over 50% of the microorganisms within the oral cavity are uncultivable, and their presence has only been identified by molecular rDNA testing (Aas et al\n2005, Paster et al\n2001). Hartley et al (1996) counted and identified microbes from tongue biofilm samples from 50 volunteers and showed a strong relationship between microbial numbers isolated (cfu cm\u22122) and the oral malodour status of human volunteers. For subjects grouped into low or high odour producers, significant increases in the total bacterial load and key bacterial groups, namely gram-negative anaerobes, were related to high odour, with two phenotypic characteristics (sulfide production and proteolytic activity) also strongly associated with malodour (Hartley et al\n1996). Further research (Hartley et al\n1999) analysed the tongue microbiota before and after use of a metronidazole mouthwash, a compound that is only effective against strict anaerobes. A reduction in oral malodour correlated closely with the reduction of strict anaerobes (predominantly Gram-negative anaerobes) whilst population levels of other species (facultative and aerobic species) remained constant throughout. Furthermore, malodour return (after 48 h) correlated with return of the strict anaerobes back to their starting numbers (Hartley et al\n1999).",

            "text": "Although there are hundreds of different VOCs reported on breath (Van den Velde et al\n2007b), the most important contributors to oral malodour are thought to be volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). The microbial degradation of cysteine residues produces H2S, and the sufhydryl anion (HS\u2212) is a strong reducing agent that drops the redox potential (Eh) within the tongue biofilm (Kleinberg and Codipilly 2008), favouring the growth of anaerobes (McNamara et al\n1972), and activating thiol-dependent enzymes including trypsin-like protease (important in the putrefaction process; Smalley et al 1994) and cysteine desulfhydrase (the very same enzymes responsible for H2S/HS\u2212 production in the first place). The detection of these compounds is complicated by the high humidity within patient breath samples, but is made possible using pre-concentration steps for GC-MS (Ochiai et al\n2001), or using analytical approaches able to handle high humidity samples without need for sample preparation (e.g. SIFT-MS or PTR-MS; Smith and Spanel 2005). Most of the non-sulfur VOCs that may contribute to halitosis appear to be produced endogenously and/or in the mouth, and include acetone, 2-butanone, 2-pentanone and 1-propanol, appearing in both alveolar and mouth air, as well as indole and dimethyl selenide found mainly in alveolar air (van den Velde et al\n2007a). In recent years halitosis associated sulfide detectors have been developed for this market, including; the Halimeter\u2122 (Rosenberg et al\n1991), zinc-oxide and tin-oxide semiconductor sensors (Shimura et al\n1996, Maita 1996) such as the Breathtron\u2122 (Tanda et al\n2007), as well as the GC-based Oralchroma\u2122 (Tangerman and Winkel 2008). Being compact, affordable, easy to use and capable of producing rapid results, they have been widely utilized in research and dental clinics, but lack the same level of sensitivity and specificity obtained using GC-MS or soft ionisation MS. However, the emergence of laser (absorption) spectroscopy for detection of volatile compounds may address this issue in future, being shown to have high sensitivity and specificity while potentially being scalable to bedside or chairside use (Ciaffoni et al\n2011).",

            "text": "There are several categories of periodontal disease. The most common category (in terms of numbers of cases) is called gingivitis (inflammation of the gum tissue). This is also described as non-destructive periodontal disease since the tissue damage is limited to gum tissue without any involvement of bone or deeper tissue structures (Armitage 1999). The condition is characterized by its reversibility to normal tissue if treated appropriately, i.e. by removal or inhibition of the aetiological agents, considered to be gingival plaque as a whole (Armitage 2004). The most common form of gingivitis is termed plaque-induced gingivitis, since its magnitude relates to the amount or \u2018load\u2019 of microbes present in the gingival plaque around the gingival margin and crevice (Armitage 1999). In the absence of treatment, gingivitis may progress to periodontitis, which is a destructive form of periodontal disease. In contrast to gingivitis, there are at least six different types of termed destructive periodontal disease because they are essentially irreversible; these include; chronic periodontitis, aggressive periodontitis, periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, necrotizing gingivitis/periodontitis, abscesses of the periodontium and combined periodontic-endodontic lesions (Armitage 2004). Whilst the destructive form involves specific species of periodontopathogens that have penetrated the gingival tissue, the non-destructive gingivitis might be simply the result of diffusion and penetration into gum tissue of small molecular weight biologically active molecules (e.g. VOCs butyrate, hydrogen sulfide, and/or histamine) produced by the plaque biomass \u2018as a whole\u2019 into tissue and known to be cytotoxic or inflammatory as pure compounds (Greenman et al\n1988). While in some sites or individuals, gingivitis never progresses to periodontitis (Ammons et al\n1972), data indicates that periodontitis is nearly always preceded by gingivitis. A group of mainly anaerobic species have been classed as \u2018periodontopathogens\u2019 and are commonly associated with chronic periodontitis. These include the proteolytic Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola, and the asaccharolytic Prevotella intermedia and Eubacterium (Loesche and Grossman 2001). Microaerophilic species associated with chronic periodontitis include Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens (Loesche and Grossman 2001).",

The diverse VOC profiles detected suggested that the generation rates of VOCs vary, and that increases in some VOCs related well with collagen breakdown (Kostelc et al\n1980, 1981). Hydrogen sulfide is usually the most predominant VSC in chronic malodour in otherwise healthy individuals. Patients with gingivitis are thought to produce higher levels of methyl mercaptan, but not as high as those generally found in cases of periodontitis (Yaegaki and Senada 1992). Indeed, it is thought that the ratio between H2S to methyl mercaptan can be reliably used to differentiate gingivitis from periodontitis, and significant correlations have been shown between the H2S to methyl mercaptan ratio and periodontal parameters (i.e. severity) (Takeuchi et al\n2010). Likely reasons for the observed differences are thought to be due to the different exposure to sulfur (S)-containing substrates. In gingivitis, the microbes are outside of the tissues and the main sources of S-containing substrates are obtained from the salivary domain. In periodontal disease, microbes are in more intimate contact with connective tissue and this is described as a serum-tissue domain, due to the presence of gingival crevicular fluid where free methionine or methionine containing peptides are at higher concentrations than in saliva.",

Many can also cause significant infection of the throat, ear, and lungs. It is unknown to what extent virus infections would cause target mammalian cells (or migrating white blood cells) to produce a profile of VOC that would be different to normal healthy cells. In adults, respiratory infections such as tonsillitis, bronchitis, or bronchiectasis, or neoplasms, and/or the presence of tonsilloliths may be responsible for causing malodour (Castellani 1930, Rio et al\n2008). VOCs from the sinuses (nasal cavity) may be detected in breath and could play a role in clinical diagnosis. In fact electronic nose technology has already been applied to this problem, and preliminary studies have shown its potential in identifying bacterial species within nose and ear swabs (Shykhon et al\n2004). Interestingly, one study has shown that GC-MS headspace analysis using SPME of the VOCs from above both pure sinus-infection associated bacterial cultures and sinus mucus itself differed significantly, and that identification of bacteria-specific volatiles was possible in some cases (Preti et al\n2009).",

Strict anaerobes such as Fusobacterium may also be associated with peritonsillar abscess formation, and some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection such as Candida albicans causing oral thrush (Choby 2009). A few other causes are rare, but possibly fatal, and include parapharyngeal space infections; peritonsillar abscess (\u2018quinsy\u2019) submandibular space infection (Ludwig's angina) and epiglottitis, the latter most often associated with the presence of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Johnstone and Lawy 1967). Bronchitis is characterized by inflammation of the mucous membranes of the bronchi that carry air and respiratory gases into or out from the lungs. About 90% of cases of acute bronchitis are caused by viruses, including rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and influenza, whereas bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis, account for about 10% of cases (Cohen and Powderly 2004). In patients with cystic fibrosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the three most common organisms causing lung infections, whereas in later life 80% of patients harbour P. aeruginosa and 3.5% Burkholderia cepacia (Rowe et al\n2005, Mitchell et al\n2007). These respiratory disorders can result in odourous gases being expelled in air via the oral cavity and the nose (Castellani 1930, Sanz et al\n2001, Yaegaki and Coil 2000). It therefore seems likely that all the main bacterial pathogens would indicate their presence in significant population numbers by emitting characteristic VOC profiles, which could then be detected in breath.",

For example, 2-aminoacetophenone has been detected (by GC-MS) in the breath of patients with cystic fibrosis, as a marker of colonisation of the lung by P. aeruginosa (Scott-Thomas et al\n2010). Interestingly the volatile sample collection device significantly affected the results; when glass sampling bulbs and Tedlar\u00ae gas sampling bags were compared, this biomarker was found only to be stable within the glass sampling bulbs (Scott-Thomas et al\n2010), and a more recent study has also highlighted the importance of the sampling procedure (Scott-Thomas et al\n2011). Aspergillus fumigates colonisation of the respiratory tract of at-risk patients (chronic lung disease) has been associated with the presence of the volatile biomarker 2-pentylfuran in breath through GC-MS analysis (Chambers et al\n2009), and this is now being developed as a novel diagnostic breath test (Chambers et al\n2011). This volatile is produced by other medically important fungi including Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Scedosporum apiospermum and Fusarium species as well as Strep. pneumoniae, and hence may have applications in other disease states. Electronic nose technology has also been applied to the diagnosis of respiratory tract infection, being shown capable of discriminating between common respiratory pathogens in vitro, including S. aureus, Strep. pneumoniae, H. influenza, and P. aeruginosa (Lai et al\n2002). Moreover, it has shown good correlation with clinical pneumonia score when used to monitor breath samples from mechanically ventilated surgical intensive care patients (Hanson and Thaler 2005).",

            "text": "Rapid, sensitive, specific, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed in order to fight tuberculosis (TB; Syhre et al\n2009), and hence the use of VOC analysis technologies coupled with Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific biomarkers is being explored. This area of research has been spurred on by the observation that rats are capable of smelling the presence of TB in sputum samples, being as least as sensitive a detection method as smear microscopy (Weetjens et al\n2009). Hence, non-specific e-nose studies have been shown capable of discriminating TB from non-TB cultures in vitro (Pavlou et al\n2004, Fend et al\n2006). Specific biomarkers of the growth of M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis cultures in vitro have also been identified (methyl phenylacetate, methyl p-anisate, methyl nicotinate and o-phenylanisole) using SPME and GC-MS (Syhre and Chambers 2008), and methyl nicotinate has shown promise as an in vivo marker of disease in the breath of patients (Syhre et al\n2009). In another study the application of GC-MS consistently identified 130 volatile compounds in the headspace of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and by using pattern recognition and fuzzy logic analysis of breath VOCs, enabled discrimination between hospitalized patients and healthy controls (Philips et al\n2007). This approach has been further developed into a breath test of active pulmonary tuberculosis, by screening for the presence of both putative oxidative stress products (alkanes and alkane derivatives) and volatile metabolites of M. tuberculosis (using GC-MS) (Philips et al\n2010). However, it should be noted that there is criticism of this studies\u2019 suggestion that alkanes and alkenes are biomarkers of oxidative stress (Kwak and Preti 2011). Moreover, breath studies in general often fail to translate into diagnostic aids, largely due to the fact that many diagnostic volatiles are present in high levels in the environment, that there are high levels of inter patient variability, and often a general lack of understanding of the biosynthetic pathways involved (Kwak and Preti 2009).",

Highly-fermentable fibre residues, such as pectin, bran and highly branched starch are transformed by colonic species of bacteria into SCFAs, including significant amounts of butyrate, whereas less fermentable fibres (such as celluloses) produce fewer SCFAs (Cummings et al\n2001).

The overall fermentation in the bovine rumen also proceeds mainly via the EMP pathway, with reductive acetyl co-enzymeA (CoA) pathway accounting for up to one-third of the total acetate, probably associated with the utilization of free H2 formed as an intermediate fermentation product and the utilization of electrons by homoacetogenic, glucose-fermenting species (Miller and Wolin 1996). The other major sources of acetate are produced from the glucose carbon skeleton, probably by a combination of the homoacetate and propionate fermentations. Propionate is formed by CO2 fixation pathways, as in the Propionibacteria, and butyrate is formed from two molecules of acetyl CoA, yielding acetoacetyl-CoA, which is then converted to butyryl-CoA (Diez-Gonzalez 1999). Thereafter, butyryl-CoA may yield butyrate by two different mechanisms, either via butyrate kinase (as in some strains of ruminal Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens), or via butyryl-CoA:acetate-CoAtransferase. The overall scheme is shown in figure 4. Colonic epithelium cells use butyrate (in preference to glucose) as their main energy source (Cummings et al\n1987) and it has been proposed that butyrate could provide protection from colon cancer and colitis (Archer et al\n1998, Christl et al\n1996). Microbial species known to produce butyrate include: Fusobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus, Butyrivibrio and Roseburia (Barcenilla et al\n2000).",

Direct gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionisation detector was capable of discriminating between urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and Klebsiella spp., by analysing spent growth medium from urine samples (Manja 1983). This approach has been further developed using an e-nose system coupled to an automated headspace analyser, which is capable of screening for bacteriuria within clinical urine samples, with the same level of sensitivity as conventional culture (Aathithan et al\n2001, Pavlou et al\n2002b). Human faecal matter has a large microbial component and due to colonic fermentation processes gives rise to a diversity of VOCs, which are largely fatty acids and a smaller VSC component (Sato et al\n2001). GC-MS analysis of \u2018stool\u2019 headspace has demonstrated that different gastrointestinal diseases produce distinct VOC profiles (Probert et al\n2004, 2009). Using multivariate discriminate analysis, significant VOC profile differences have been observed between asymptomatic volunteers and patients with Campylobacter jejuni, ulcerative colitis, or Clostridium difficile infections (Garner et al\n2007). Moreover, this approach has been used to characterize the VOC profile of fecal matter from premature neonates (De Lacy Costello et al\n2008), and with the monitoring of certain VOC profile \u2018shifts\u2019 has potential for use as an early indicator of neonate necrotising enterocolitis (Garner et al\n2009).",

            "text": "Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a complex change in the vaginal flora. The healthy virginal flora is dominated by Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide and produce organic acids (mainly lactic acid) from glycogen in the vaginal epithelium; sufficient to maintain the pH to less than pH 4.7 (V\u00e1squez et al\n2002). They may also synthesize bacteriocins and other inhibitory compounds. In vaginosis, these lactobacilli are replaced by an increased concentration of other organisms, especially anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides spp., anaerobic Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., or Atopobium vaginae (Fredricks et al\n2005). The change in the microflora at the advent of bacterial vaginosis can also be observed microscopically using Gram stain of smears from discharge samples. Gram-positive, long bacilli are predominant in a healthy microflora whilst Gram variable cocci and coccobacilli are dominant in disease. The symptoms of vaginosis can vary from asymptomatic, to one or more of the following: abnormal vaginal discharge (with an unpleasant odour), itching, burning sensation during urination and discomfort during intercourse. Gardnerella vaginalis produces proteolytic carboxylases that decompose vaginal peptides, releasing a variety of amines with fishy odour including putrescine, cadaverine and trimethylamine (Kwak and Preti 2011). These amines volatilize increasingly with rising pH, so patients often note a worsening of this symptom as the vaginal alkalinity is enhanced. Even women considered as clinically normal fall into two types based on their odorant production (Huggins and Preti (1983). These odour differences may be linked to differences in the population of bacterial flora harboured by individual females.",

            "text": "The precursors to axillary odour are produced by the apocrine glands (Shehadeh and Kligman 1963a, 1963b, Zeng et al\n1992, Gower et al\n1994), and the characteristic axillary odour of humans is formed by the interaction of odourless, precursor molecules found in apocrine secretions with cutaneous, axillary microorganisms (Shehadeh and Kligman 1963a, Leyden et al\n1981). It is generally considered that freshly secreted sweat is sterile and that body malodour (e.g. under arm odour; UAO) is the result of biotransformation of sweat components by micro-organisms living on the surface of the skin around the apocrine glands (in the proximity of the axilla) to produce VOCs that are odoriferous. In vitro and in vivo studies of the relationship between UAO and the cutaneous microflora have shown the presence of three dominant genera (aerobic coryneforms, Micrococcaceae and propionibacteria) with no competition for habitat between these groups (Preti and Leyden 2010 and references cited therein). A relationship has also been established between severity of cases and the dominance of aerobic coryneforms within the axillary microflora populations, with Corynebacterium xerosis identified as key (Rennie et al\n1990). A statistically significant association between population density of aerobic coryneform bacteria and UAO intensity was observed, whilst no such associations could be found between UAO and population densities of staphylococci, micrococci or propionibacteria (Rennie et al\n1990). With regard to the production of UAO then it had been shown that Corynebacterium species are unusual in possessing \u2018rare\u2019 enzymes or metabolic pathways to biotransform 16-androstene steroids into odiferous products e.g. 5\u03b1-androstenol, 5\u03b1-androstenone, 3\u03b1(\u03b2)-androstenols, 4,16-androstadien-3-one as well as keto-substituted compounds. All these example compounds were found to be more odiferous than the 16-androstene steroids used as precursors, and found naturally in fresh apocrine sweat secretions (Rennie et al\n1991). Thus the causal links to the production of high UAO were thought to be clear. However, more recent studies have shown that other pathways to odiferous VOC may be much more important regarding UAO. For example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid and 3-methylhex-2-enoic acid (and other related acids) are generated via microbial aminoacylase activity from precursors naturally present in axilliary secretions (Natsch et al\n2003, Natsch et al\n2006). The enzyme is a zinc-dependent N\u03b1-acyl-glutamine aminoacylase (N-AGA) produced from Corynebacterium xerosis, Corynebacterium striatum and other species of Corynebacterium, but not in Staphylococcus or Propionibacterium genus. Other precursors may include the N-terminal amino acid of apolipoprotein D that is putatively covalently bound to 3-hydroxy-3-methyl hexanoic acid, and other key odour acids in axillary sweat (Zeng et al\n1996, Akiba et al\n2011). However, these alternate theories regarding biogenesis still correspond with the strong correlation between a high population of corynebacteria and strong axilliary odour. These compounds are highly odiferous and their pattern of production may even be associated with MHC-allele-dependent mate selection phenomenon in rodents (Yamazaki et al\n1976) and there are strong genetic influences in the patterns of VOCs in humans (Preti and Leyden 2010).",

These VOCs are produced from C-S lyase activity of malodour-forming corynebacteria (Natsch et al\n2004) and have broad substrate specificity for cysteine conjugates. The specific enzyme involved is probably the cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase enzyme (metC gene product) associated with corynebacteria but not staphylococcus (Natsch et al\n2004). In addition, Staphylococcus spp. and Propionibacterium spp. are known to produce a wide range of volatile carboxylic acids, including; isovaleric, isobutyric and propionic acids, as main end-products of the primary fermentation pattern of the species, and may contribute to UAO.",

            "text": "Marshall et al (1987, 1988) examined the microflora found on normal feet and found that foot odour was associated with high population densities of staphylococci and aerobic coryneform. Feet with strong odours had significantly higher population densities of microorganisms that produced hydrolytic exoenzymes (lipase, protease, and callous degrading enzymes). Kanda et al (1990) found that isomers of SCFAs were the primary components of foot odour, and Kobayashi (1990) found that Staph. epidermidis, which is a normal resident of the skin, plays a major role in the development of foot odour. Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is an infection of the foot caused by fungi called dermatophytes which invade the \u2018dead\u2019 outer layers of the skin (Weitzman and Summerbell 1995). The fungi thrive in warm, moist, and dark environments and the disease was thought to be fairly uncommon before human beings started wearing shoes. Pitted keratolysis occurs worldwide, seen in both tropical and temperate environments, and it can be related to occupation or sport activity. Microbial overgrowth of the normal flora occurs, with species including; Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermatophilus congolensis or species of Corynebacterium, Actinomyces or Streptomyces (Nordstrom et al\n1987, Woodgyer et al\n1985, Longshaw et al\n2002). Under appropriate conditions such as prolonged occlusion, hyperhidrosis and increased skin surface pH, these species proliferate and produce proteinases that destroy the stratum corneum, creating pits (Holland et al\n1992). Dermatophilus congolensis liberates keratinases in appropriate substrate (Hanel et al\n1991), and K. sedentarius has been found to produce two keratin-degrading enzymes (Longshaw et al\n2002). The malodour associated with pitted keratolysis is presumed to be the production of sulfur-compound by-products, such as thiols, sulfides, and thioesters (Nordstrom et al\n1986). Strong foot odour (but without pitted skin changes) has also been described due to overgrowth of Staph. epidermidis and production of isovaleric acid from leucine (found in sweat; Ara et al\n2006). Overgrowth of Bacillus subtilis and presence of Brevibacterium have also been associated with strong foot odour. The latter produces methyl mercaptan from methionine; a product of enzyme-hydrolysed skin components (Ara et al\n2006).",

It is generally accepted that all acute, traumatic, surgical and chronic wounds become contaminated with microorganisms (Bowler et al\n2001). This does not necessarily provide a barrier to wound healing, and it is only if a wound progresses towards infection, that there will be a failure to move through the phases of healing in a timely manner (Edwards and Harding 2004). Chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers and pressure ulcers, are known to be regularly colonized by a large number and diverse species of microorganisms including anaerobic organisms (Howell-Jones et al\n2005), even when no clinical sign of infection is evident, possibly correlating with critical colonisation (Panuncialman and Falanga 2009). The classic sign of wound infection is inflammation (localized heat, pain, oedema and erythema), but further criteria include abscess, discharge (often purulent), discolouration (within and around wound margins), bleeding (friable) granulation tissue and wound malodour, i.e. VOCs that are odiferous (Edwards and Harding 2004).",

Various compounds were detected (e.g. acetic, butyric and isobutyric acid), but the main fungating wound odorant was identified as dimethyl trisulfide (C2H6S3), and although no attempt was made to identify its source, it was postulated that this may be the product of bacteria present within the wound bed (Shirasu et al\n2009). Arrays of conducting polymer sensors (e-nose) have now been developed for the purpose of wound monitoring (Bailey et al 2008). One such instrument (the \u2018wound-monitor\u2019) analyses swab material, by first using a solid phase micro extraction (SPME) pre-concentration step, and then together with a pattern recognition system is hoped to assist early and rapid diagnosis of patient wounds (Persaud 2008). Early results have shown good differentiation between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cultures (Persaud 2008). The instrument has also been shown capable of differentiating between infected and uninfected burns patients by pre-concentrating volatiles from swabs and wound dressing material, using principle component analysis (PCA) to analyse the resultant volatile spectrum (Byun et al\n2010). If any such devices are to be used for direct \u2018wound sniffing\u2019 then one problem to be overcome (for all wound types), is the large diversity of human biological volatiles emanating from skin/wounds unrelated to the microbial community present. These must be further identified and characterized, so that signature microbial metabolic processes or volatile profiles can then be detected for use as a diagnostic tool. This would enable the development of a true \u2018bedside\u2019 clinical tool for rapid and non-invasive wound assessment.",

Modern VOC analysis tends to focus on one of two approaches (1) identifying VOC biomarkers only produced by particular species or (2) searching for a range of different VOCs, none of which are unique in themselves but together forming a unique pattern. For example, the first approach has been used in the identification of P. aeruginosa, using the grape-like odour 2-aminoacetophenone, detected by GC-MS (Cox and Parker 1979, Labows et al\n1980). However, as with many other \u2018species-specific\u2019 biomarkers, there are reports of the non-specificity of this compound (Allardyce et al\n2006a), and meticulous design of diagnostic approaches is required if they are to have utility in healthcare facilities.",

Distinct pathways include acetone-butanol fermentation (a characteristic of some Clostridium species: products include acetone, butanol and ethanol), butanediol fermentation (Aerobacter, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Serratia: products include acetate, 2,3-butanediol, butylene glycol, ethanol, carbon dioxide and hydrogen), butyric-butylic fermentation (Clostridium species: products include acetate, butyrate, ethanol, isopropanol, carbon dioxide and hydrogen), homolactic fermentation (Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus: products include lactate and small amounts of acetate), heterolactic fermentation (Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus: products include lactate with significant amounts of acetate and ethanol), mixed acid fermentation (Escherichia, Proteus, Providencia, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia: products include acetate, ethanol, formate, lactate, succinate, carbon dioxide, hydrogen) and propionic fermentation (Propionibacterium: products include acetate, propionate and carbon dioxide). Therefore different species can be differentiated by reference to their principle metabolic products, some of which will be volatile, and this has enabled differentiation and identification of potentially pathogenic organisms in vitro (Pavlou et al\n2002a, Thorn et al\n2011).",

            "text": "Many different physical in vitro models have been used to study growth, metabolism and VOC production in microorganisms, and these are summarized in figure 5. All models break down into two main systems: closed (figures 5(a) and (b)) and open (figures 5(c), (d) and (e)). Open systems have nutrient flow, which brings new nutrients and removes products. Closed systems usually refer to a batch culture where the microorganisms of interest are co-incubated with media and substrates with no additional inputs (i.e. nutrients, media, substrates) or removal of outputs (except those required for analysis). A further distinction can be made for planktonic (i.e. cells in suspension; figures 5(a) and (c)) or biofilm model (figures 5(b), (d) and (e)). Analysis of VOC profiles for a wide number of bacterial species growing planktonically in batch culture mode has now been described (Bunge et al\n2008, Thorn et al\n2011). Although these models can reveal the presence of a wide range of characteristic VOCs for different species, the amounts produced will vary considerably over the period of incubation. In batch culture (figures 5(a) and (b)), growth of the cells goes through different phases (lag, exponential, stationary and decline) and all main physicochemical parameters (substrate concentration, product concentrations, growth rate, growth yield) are never constant. In general, this model is of limited use when trying to extrapolate to how microbes may be behaving in vivo (in response to set changes). In contrast, open systems refer to planktonic culture (figure 5(c)) or biofilm models (figures 5(d) and (e)) that have an element of continuous culture, whereby the nutrient and substrate requirements of the culture are constantly replenished and fed into the system, thus supporting continuous growth. Additionally, outputs from the biofilm (i.e. metabolites, VOCs, cells from microbial growth) are able to leave the system and are available for analysis if required, and dynamic steady states are possible (McBain 2009).",

            "text": "For the vast majority of cases of microbial infections (whether skin, oral cavity, lungs or wound) the microbes attach to a local substratum or matrix to form biofilms (Wilson 2001). Depending on the particular physicochemical conditions, the microbes utilize local nutrient substrates and multiply. The most immediate source of supply of substrates depends upon the composition of the perfusing fluids found in the nutrient domain of the biofilm. For example, supragingival dental plaque is served by nutrients derived from saliva, whilst sub-gingival plaque is served with crevicular fluid (which is a serum-derived exudate) (Marsh and Martin 1999). Typically, a small amount of growth is sustained by immediately available small molecular weight compounds (sugars, amino acids) dissolved in the fluidic domain of the biofilm. This would be blood and serum for infected wounds, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for biofilms in the bronchus/lung, or urine and gastric fluids for urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections respectively. For modelling purposes biofilms are grown under closed (figure 5(b)) or open (figures 5(d) and (e)) conditions. For example, caries-like biofilms can be grown by inoculating dental plaque samples onto slices of hydroxyapatite, glass, or plastic surfaces and saliva periodically added or allowed to flow continuously across the biofilm. For a solid impermeable substratum (such as bone and tooth), the bacterial biofilms are only supplying nutrients from above. They form inner layers, intermediate layers and outer layers, such that inner cells are starved of nutrients by the intermediate and outer layers that are more directly exposed to salivary nutrients. A chemical gradient of growth rate limiting nutrients is formed such that the growth rate of the biofilm cells on the inside are close to zero, whilst close to the maximum dictated by local physicochemical conditions on the outside. As a result, there is a wide distribution of both growth rates and molecule residence times within the system as a whole, and hence the biofilm is heterogeneous. This is not the situation on substrata that are freely permeable. For example, biofilms formed on cellulosic or carbon-veil substrata are served with nutrients by local perfusion via micro-channels (figure 5(e)); cells are more equally supplied with nutrients and all grow at similar rates (Spencer et al\n2007, Greenman et al\n2008a).",

Kleinberg and Codipilly (1995) examined a range of gram-positive (n = 13) and gram-negative (n = 12) pure species supplemented with a range of 18 separate amino acids, and showed that gram-negative organisms produced significantly higher malodorous compounds compared to other groups. Although only batch culture, these models nevertheless helped to confirm the importance of S-metabolism in oral malodour. In dental research, a defined consortium of microorganisms is often used to investigate ecological phenomena such as species interaction, communication (quorum sensing) and competition, which would otherwise be difficult to measure for reasons of complexity. Defined consortiums make use of simplified combinations of organisms that are able to grow together when supplied with same media, and are readily identifiable by selective culture techniques. An example of a defined consortium would be the \u2018Marsh consortium\u2019 developed by Philip Marsh (CAMR, Porton down, Sailsbury, UK) for use in chemostats. This consortium comprises 10 bacterial strains (Bradshaw et al\n1996), representing many of the important physiological and ecological groups that exist in plaque. Although, perhaps surprisingly VSC or microbial VOCs have been little studied using planktonic continuous culture models.",

They are what remain through survival of the transfer process, from in vivo to model. The diversity of a microcosm is usually less than the original inoculum, although it is nevertheless more diverse than a defined consortium. Microcosms have the advantage of maintaining much of the complexity of the original sample, enabling the in vivo microbial community dynamics to be replicated within the biofilm model. For example, a constant depth film fermentor (CDFF) was used to develop plaque microcosm biofilms from inoculation with real plaque samples, and subsequently removed and analysed for VSC generation ex situ using a portable sulfide analyser (Pratten et al\n2003). The model is an example of a continuous culture biofilm, but with biofilm formation over an impermeable substratum surface (figure 5(d)). In contrast, the \u2018Sorbarod\u2019 system is an example of a continuous flow biofilm using a highly permeable matrix (the Sorbarod; figure 5(e); Hodgson et al\n1995). This system has been shown to be capable of maintaining a complex microcosm of tongue-scrape derived inoculums, and this has provided insight into the microbial ecology, physiology and VSC production of oral malodour production (Spencer et al\n2007, Greenman et al\n2008b, Taylor and Greenman 2010).",

Consequently, more research is required to further identify microbial specific VOCs, but also to \u2018unequivocally\u2019 identify the structure of these microbial associated VOCs (Kai et al\n2009) so as to better enable their future detection. This situation is further complicated by the fact that the specific VOCs produced by a given microbial community in vivo will often differ from that in vitro due to varying growth substrates, presence of other (often uncultivable) competing microorganisms, and the impact of host processes. It is important to adequately define the \u2018research question\u2019 being investigated, and hence for in vitro identification systems substrates should be provided that best discriminate microbial metabolic processes as monitored through VOC analysis. However, when developing in vivo detection systems then any in vitro characterisation must attempt to best replicate the real-world environment, including provision of appropriate growth substrates, and potentially actual clinical material as has been suggested by one author investigating sinus infection (Preti et al\n2009). In future it is likely that headspace gas sample VOC profiles from real conditions (in situ from a human) will be compared to an analogous model in the laboratory (see section on in vitro modelling). The differences can then be used to identify VOCs arising from the mammalian system alone, against those produced in the model (microbial alone).",

The ultimate goal of diagnostic VOC analysis would be online sampling of patient breath and/or body odour, enabling bedside or chairside diagnosis of their status in vivo. The rapid advancement of online VOC analysis technologies (e.g. SIFT-MS, PTR-MS) goes someway to realizing this goal, but future developments must be focused on miniaturizing technology without losing analytical or clinical sensitivity or specificity. Perhaps one of the most under-researched areas in the application of microbial VOC analysis in the clinic is time-course VOC analysis (of patient or patient samples), to assess treatment success or failure. For example, preliminary investigations have shown e-nose technology capable of following progression towards healing during wound care treatment (Edwards-Jones and Greenwood 2003). However, for this to be more widely used, VOC sampling and analysis will need to be cost effective in terms of both time and money to enable repeat patient measurements to be made.",

            "text": "It is clear that a huge array of microbial metabolic processes give rise to VOCs, and that these processes are dependent on local physicochemical conditions (e.g. anatomical location). VOC analysis as a method to monitor the progression of microbial disease (and response to treatment) has obvious advantages since it would enable timely and effective treatment decisions, reducing the need for broad spectrum antibiotics and potentially reducing the spread of microbial resistance. Moreover, being non-invasive it would have high patient acceptability. Although more research is needed to truly elucidate microbial VOC generating processes, it is envisaged that in future \u2018VOC profiling\u2019 will enable rapid characterisation of microbial associated disease, providing vital information to healthcare practitioners.",
