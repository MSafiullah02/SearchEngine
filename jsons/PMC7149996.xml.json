            "text": "Whatever the species or cloning technique used, fetal survival to live offspring is generally very low, with the proportion of live offspring/number of transferred embryos being approximately 6\u201315% in cattle and 6% in pigs (European Food Safety Authority, 2012). This low survival rate has not changed much over the past 10 years, and the success rate is to some extent dependent on the genotype of the donor cell line and the cell type used (Heyman et al., 2002, Panarace et al., 2007). The predominant problem encountered in clone pregnancies from most species is failure of placental formation or abnormal placental development, as reviewed recently in cattle (Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2012). In cattle, early pregnancy losses are due to failure of the placenta to form properly (Heyman et al., 2002, Hill et al., 2000, Hoffert et al., 2005, Kohan-Ghadr et al., 2008) whereas in late pregnancy the number of placentomes is often reduced but with a greatly increased placental weight. Abnormalities in fetal growth (early fetal growth retardation with or without subsequent fetal compensatory growth\nor even overgrowth) are common, together with various developmental abnormalities. Hydroallantois and/or abnormal fetal membranes are often reported in ruminants and pigs, and induce heavy perinatal mortality (Heyman et al., 2002, Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2012, Schmidt, 2007, Schmidt et al., 2010, Schmidt et al., 2011). Recipient dams often show a lack of preparation for parturition, and it is rare for these animals to deliver unassisted. Perinatal mortality is higher and survival to weaning is reduced compared with naturally conceived offspring (70\u201375% survival compared to>90%, respectively) (Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2004, Hill et al., 1999, Wells et al., 2004, Watanabe and Nagai, 2009, Watanabe and Nagai, 2011), with some neonatal cloned calves requiring a high level of veterinary intervention to ensure their continued survival (Batchelder et al., 2007a, Batchelder et al., 2007b, Brisville et al., 2011, Meirelles et al., 2010, Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2002b, Hill and Chavatte-Palmer, 2002). Those that survive the first weeks (pig) or to maturity (cattle), however, appear healthy and normal, and food products derived from animal clones are indistinguishable from those derived from conventional animals (as reviewed previously (European Food Safety Authority, 2012; Food and Drug Administration, 2008; Barlow et al., 2008; Kocchar and Rudenko, 2010)), although one report from AgResearch indicates that the culling rate of SCNT cows due to poor health is increased in SCNT compared to controls (Wells et al., 2004).To date, the main obstacle to the further development of the use of SCNT in animals is the heavy pre- and perinatal loss observed in all species, and the ensuing welfare concerns both for the recipient dam and for the clone itself.\n",

            "text": "Because of the high incidence of abnormal offspring syndrome (also known as large offspring syndrome or large placenta syndrome) (Young et al., 1999, Farin et al., 2006, Constant et al., 2006), recipient dams for clone embryos should be selected based on their potential to deliver a larger calf through the vagina and, for cows, a known history of successful uncomplicated delivery. Both heifers and cows are being used successfully to carry clone pregnancies (Chavatte-Palmer and Lee, 2010, IETS Health and Safety Advisory Committee, 2008). Heifers are sometimes preferred because of their higher potential to become pregnant after regular embryo transfer, although they present more potential complications due to dystocia at term. On the other hand, multiparous cows tend to have heavier calves as a function of parity, especially after the fourth or fifth calving (Ferrel, 1989), and therefore older females should be avoided. In AgResearch (NZ), Hereford\u2013Friesian crossbred animals that have calved successfully at least once are generally used as recipients for SCNT embryos. These crossbred animals have been found to be more robust than pure-bred Friesians, and their larger frames enable them to better handle calving of the eventual large SCNT calves. Animals that fail to become pregnant after three consecutive rounds of embryo transfer should be eliminated as recipients. Recipients should be in good body condition (3\u20133.5 on a 1\u20135 scale) and fed to maintenance levels. The recipient cows are synchronized for estrus and the embryos transferred using standard protocols. The choice between single or double transfer was not reported to make a difference in pregnancy rates to term (Panarace et al., 2007, Heyman et al., 1997), although the transfer of two embryos improved the chances for the maintenance of pregnancy beyond the embryo stage. Indeed, unpublished ultrasonographic observations at UC Davis in twin pregnancies indicate that if one of the embryos dies before blood vessel anastomosis (before days 35\u201338), the other embryo appears to stand a better chance of surviving beyond the fetal stage, maybe due to fusion of extra-embryonic membranes from both embryos to the benefit of the surviving embryo. Unpublished data at INRA, however, suggest that late SCNT twin pregnancies may be at a higher risk of abortion compared to singletons.",

Over the 2000\u20132008 period, 1531 SCNT embryos were transferred to 560 recipients, with 765 of these embryos surviving to day 35 gestation (50%). Of these pregnancies, 100 became hydrallantoic (13%). Fetal extraction was performed in 88 of these pregnancies (the rest being slaughtered for recovery of intact placental tissues). Forty of the treated post-hydrops recipients were subjected to single SCNT embryo transfers, and 24/40 (60%) conceived successfully within two rounds of embryo transfer. Of the 67 SCNT embryos transferred, 27 (40%) survived to day 35 and two pregnancies went on to develop hydrallantois. This shows that recipients which have previously carried a hydrallantoic pregnancy can be successfully treated and can become pregnant again on subsequent rounds of SCNT embryo transfers. These animals did not develop more hydrops than conventional recipients, supporting evidence that hydrops is an inherent developmental problem of a proportion of SCNT embryos and not the recipients chosen. Valuable recipients can therefore be re-used for subsequent pregnancies, saving animal wastage.",

Given that SCNT calves tend to be larger than normal calves, it is prudent to induce calving at day 270 of gestation, rather than leave it until later, especially since SCNT pregnancies are generally prolonged, leading to the birth of larger calves (Hill and Chavatte-Palmer, 2002). Induction of parturition is routinely carried out, as cattle carrying SCNT fetuses tend not to show signs of preparation for parturition, if left alone. Calving induction involves giving a single i.m. injection (in the anterior of the neck) of 25 mg long-acting DEX at day 270. At the same time, the cow is given an injection of a mix of Vitamins A, D3 and E (Hidejet, Bomac). All animals are initially monitored for 20 minutes after the DEX injection and then over the next few days for signs of mammary development. Occasionally, an animal may calve after the first DEX injection. Seven days after the first DEX injection, a second injection of 25 mg short-acting DEX is given. Calving usually occurs within 48 hours after the second injection. However, some animals may require an additional short-acting DEX injection before they calve. If the dam shows any signs of distress or appears unable to push the calf out, an emergency C-section should then be performed.",

The date to induce is usually based on the mean of the gestational length in cattle of the same breed in the same herd, and the recipient cows are allowed to calve on their own if parturition initiates before that date (Hill and Chavatte-Palmer, 2002; Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2002a). However, if abnormal placental/fetal development or an abnormally large calf, based on ultrasound observations or rectal palpation (Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2003, Le Cleac\u2019h et al., 2011), is observed within 2 weeks of this calculated term date, the C-section date may be brought forward. Induction protocols differ between laboratories. One indirect (although less sensitive) method of predicting fetal readiness for birth is to monitor steroid hormones in the final 1\u20132 weeks. These values can be compared against well-established normal values, where there is a slow fall in progesterone and rise in estrogens in the 2 weeks prior to birth. Two to three days prior to birth, progesterone falls abruptly and estrogens increase rapidly. By using these data, induction can be delayed until maternal progesterone has fallen below 5\u20136 ng/ml and estradiol has risen above 200 pg/ml (Hill and Chavatte-Palmer, 2002). This is not always practical, as routine assays must be available to get results back promptly. Retrospective data from INRA shows that C-sections were performed in cows with blood plasma progesterone ranging from 5.5 to 11 ng/ml.",

As retained membranes are usually observed after the induction of parturition, a dose of prostaglandin analogue, given i.m to the dam within the first hour after the vaginal or the C-section delivery, has been suggested to facilitate the release of the fetal membranes (Gross and Williams, 1988, Stocker and Waelchli, 1993). In a few cases of IVF- or SCNT-derived pregnancies carrying large calves, membranes are retained not because of a lack of membrane detachment from the uterus but as a consequence of greater depth of cotyledonary villi invasion, reduced uterine tone, and/or a partial closure of the birth (cervical) canal. In such cases, a close examination 12 hours after birth will reveal that membranes are loose and they can be rather easily pulled out by a gentle, rotating or jiggling, manual traction.",

            "text": "Contracted flexor tendons in neonatal SCNT calves greatly hamper their attempts to stand and suckle. Where the contraction is slight, these calves will usually recover with normal exercise. However, some calves are born with severely contracted joints that cannot be corrected, even with tendonectomy (Figure 9.1\n), as the bones on either side of the joint have grown in such a way that the joint cannot be straightened. Contracted joints have seen observed in a day 110 SCNT fetus, suggesting that in some cases it is a developmental problem that has already manifested itself early in gestation. In such cases, it is better to euthanize the calf and not put it through surgical correction, which will be ineffective. It may be possible to X-ray the joints first to see how the bones fit together before a decision is made whether to treat or to euthanize the calf. If a decision is made to deliver a large calf through the vagina, care must be exercised when pulling the calf out, as some SCNT calves are very rigid and inflexible. This problem may range from a few contractures to an arthrogryposis-like condition. The extra large size of the calves and less flexible bones may, in some cases, have contributed to fractures in the vertebrae or cracked ribs sustained during a difficult delivery. Increased bone mineral density in the long bones has been observed in some SCNT calves, and this may explain the rigidity of the bones at birth (Green et al., 2007) (Figure 9.1B, AgResearch). In contrast, preliminary work from INRA indicates a lower bone mineral density, as determined by densitometry, in SCNT calves and adults compared to controls. These differences may be related to the different cloning technique or donor cell lineage.",

Dangerous umbilical hemorrhaging and death may occur if the vessels are not clamped off quickly. The larger umbilici also predispose SCNT calves to postnatal ascending umbilical infections. Suturing the ends of the umbilical stump after birth markedly reduces the incidence of such infections. During initial cloning attempts at UC Davis and at INRA, several born cloned calves died of conditions directly or indirectly related to umbilical infections, even up to 2 months following birth, despite all efforts to control the problem; all had enlarged umbilici. As a minimal procedure, after delivery by C-section the cord should be clamped with two hemostats then dilacerated with a blunt instrument and the vessels clamped off individually with human navel clamps or ligated. The severed end of the cord (and only the end) can be chemically burnt with a mixture of iodine and alcohol, which assists in drying the tissue. Surgical removal of an enlarged umbilicus is now performed routinely at birth in SCNT calves under local anesthesia at INRA (general anesthesia should be avoided), or upon any sign of inflammation or abnormal healing at UC Davis. Usually it involves only the subcutaneous portion of the cord, but in older calves a complete removal may need to be performed after laparotomy under general anesthesia.",

            "text": "Many SCNT calves are slow to get up, and show poor suckling reflexes. Such calves need to be helped and encouraged to find the teat and start suckling. If no progress is made after 2 hours, 2 liters of colostrum should be given from a bottle or administered through a tube. The calf should consume about 10% of its body weight in colostrum in the first 24 hours, with half being administered within 6 hours after birth when gut closure is minimal. If the dam provides good quality colostrum, this can be used; otherwise, colostrum from the bank is used. An alternative colostrum source should be made available to calves born by C-section, as the dams usually do not produce any at this stage. Other measures, such as oral colostrum paste, first defense bolus with antibodies to E. coli and coronavirus, or Clostridium perfingens antitoxin injection, should be taken prior to the first feeding to prevent infection. Moreover, if the calf cannot be kept with the dam, it should be fed with colostrum five times during the first 24 hours until gut closure. Colostrum feeding may be continued for the next 2 days to provide local intestinal protection, but at that time cannot be expected to increase the calf\u2019s plasma IgG levels. Thereafter, feeding can be less frequent and managed as for normal hand-reared calves. Plasma gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) levels in bloods taken within 48 hours after birth give a good indication of whether colostrum ingestion has been adequate (<50 IU/l, inadequate intake; 50\u2013200 IU/l, marginal intake;>200 IU/l, adequate intake) (Perino et al., 1993, Thompson and Pauli, 1981). Alternatively, a comparison between total plasma protein before and after colostrum intake can be performed using a plasma refractometer.",

At INRA, where C-section delivery is usually performed in the morning, hypoglycemia requiring i.v. glucose infusion is frequently observed in the evening of that same day. If the calf is not standing, it should be kept in sternal recumbency using pads, and heating should be applied to maintain normal body temperature. In order to avoid skin ulcers, soft bedding (such as sheepskin) can be used. Sometimes, hyperthermia is observed in otherwise clinically normal calves. After exclusion of infection, the calves should be cooled down with wet towels (for body temperature<40\u00b0C or 104\u00b0F) or alcohol or water baths (for temperatures>40\u00b0C or 104F) (Chavatte-Palmer and Lee, 2010, IETS Health and Safety Advisory Committee, 2008). At INRA, these symptoms have been greatly reduced since the installation of air cooling in the barn used for the cloned calves. If the suckling reflex is absent, calves are fed by tubing. Bloat is then a common occurrence, and can be treated with drugs like metoclopramide. Total parenteral nutrition has also been used to increase the chances of survival of a cloned transgenic calf (Mucci et al., 2011). Finally, internal hemorrhage is frequently encountered after normal calving (retroperitoneal hemorrhage) (Wells et al., 2004), but can also occur after C-section (PCP, unpublished data), and needs to be rapidly detected and promptly treated.",

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn is characterized by sustained elevations of pulmonary vascular resistance after birth, leading to right-to-left shunting of blood across the ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale and resulting in severe hypoxemia. Reverse flow through the ductus arteriosus and through the foramen ovale has been documented using echocardiography (Hill et al., 1999, Hill and Chavatte-Palmer, 2002). Therapies aimed at improving pulmonary function include pulmonary surfactant, oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, pulmonary arterial vasodilators, and bronchodilators (Hill et al., 1999, Brisville et al., 2011, Meirelles et al., 2010, Hill and Chavatte-Palmer, 2002). Large neonatal units use constant (at least hourly) monitoring of vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, demeanor), together with clinical details (auscultation, palpation, etc.), laboratory tests (metabolic profiles, hematology), blood gas measurements (arterial samples, pulse oximetry), radiology (chest and abdominal X-rays), and echocardiography.

            "text": "Most calves that survive beyond the first 2\u20133 months of life are healthy and do not require special care. At 6 months of age and beyond, hematological and biochemical parameters have been within normal range in SCNT calves studied to date (Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2002b, Green et al., 2008a). Although impaired glucose regulation was observed in some SCNT calves in the neonatal period, basal blood glucose levels were similar and the glucose tolerance tests performed on one group of 6-month-old SCNT calves showed that the response (glucose clearance and insulin secreted in response to the glucose bolus) was similar to that in normal control AI calves (Green et al., 2008b). In this same cohort of SCNT calves, a direct adrenal challenge showed that the time taken for cortisol levels to peak was delayed after infusion of ACTH, but the rate of initial cortisol increase was not different (Green et al., 2008b). However, it is important to remember that these kinds of physiological responses are likely to be different from one SCNT cohort to another, and may change with age. What matters is whether these slight differences in physiological responses affect the way SCNT animals respond to external stressors. What kind of stressors will overwhelm them is unknown at the moment. Finally, cryptorchidism has been occasionally reported in male SCNT calves, but it is difficult to know whether this is directly related to the cloning procedure (Green et al., 2008b, Janssen et al., 2004). Delayed testicular descent has been observed in many mid-gestation SCNT fetuses; none have been seen with gestation-matched normal IVP or AI controls (RL, personal observations).",

Indeed, a risk of \u201cmitochondrial incompatibility\u201d was suggested for the reconstructed embryo after cloning with Yucatan somatic cells and cytoplast donors from domestic pigs, with subsequent reduced compatibility between the Yucatan placenta and the occidental uterine environment (Estrada et al., 2008). In some studies, the best pregnancy results were obtained when donor cell and recipient breeds were matching (Koo et al., 2009), while others found the best results when domestic pigs were used as recipients for minipig SCNT embryos (Kurome et al., 2008). In our own work (Schmidt et al., 2010), we found no indication of problems with such combinations. Finally, after birth, when minipiglets are born from a large recipient sow, there will be size incompatibility between the mother\u2019s nipples and the piglet\u2019s mouth that may call for hand feeding for the first few days (Estrada et al., 2008, Kurome et al., 2008). It is crucial to reduce the risk of crushing by the sow, as this is a frequently reported reason for death for piglets.",

Synchronization protocols include progesterone (Regumate\u00ae) feeding (Petersen et al., 2008; Martinez-Diaz et al., 2010)) and/or combined hormonal stimulation with eCG followed by induction of ovulation with hCG (Petersen et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2009, Park et al., 2009, Martinez-Diaz et al., 2010). When prepubertal gilts are used, synchronization is based on a combined eCG\u2013hCG treatment (Kurome et al., 2008). For sows, a synchronization protocol starting with abortion induced by PGF2\u03b1 followed by a combined eCG\u2013hCG treatment has been reported (Kurome et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2010), but the natural occurrence of estrus after weaning of the piglets can also be used (Schmidt et al., 2010, Schmidt et al., 2011). This heat comes, on average, after 5 days, so the sows are observed for classical heat signs from days 4 to 6 or 7. In our work, heat sign intensity was graded to identify the day of maximal heat, which was later used for determination of synchrony between embryos and recipient.",

There is, however, a fairly large variation in the actual numbers transferred, which is often determined by the embryo production efficiency. The pregnancy rate and litter size are increased when transferring 60\u2013120 embryos compared to<60 (6.1 vs 4.2, respectively (Schmidt et al., 2010); Figure 9.2\n). Early-stage embryos are transferred into the ampulla or ampulla\u2013isthmic junction of the oviduct, while the later stages are transferred into the tip of one uterine horn. We compared transfer into one or both uterine horns and found an increased delivery rate when transferring into the tips of both uterine horns (74% vs 44%) (Schmidt et al., 2010). Following transfer, treatment with a combined eCG\u2013hCG injection around days 12 and 15 after surgery has been reported (Petersen et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2008).",

In the above description, no specific differentiation has been made between the two types of uses \u2013 i.e., non-transgenic or transgenic \u2013 as only very few studies have attempted to make such comparisons, mainly because of limited numbers of animals. Our general impression, however, is that using transgenic cells in the cloning system only adds to the variation and the various problems found with cloning alone. This depends also on the type of transgenic modification and the method used to make the cells transgenic. With the increasing use of cloning in pigs and very recent successful reports (e.g., in disease models for various important human diseases), the coming years will bring even more cloned pigs. This will add to the knowledge about the different areas where the technique can be improved, and most likely also result in such improvements as have occurred in cattle over the past 10\u201315 years.",

The kittens had both survived to 4 months of age at the time of publication. Most of the pregnancy losses in cat SCNT were reported to occur early in gestation; however, what effect the transfer of such large numbers of embryos has on early embryonic development is unknown. The next stage of gestation where fetal losses occur is about two-thirds of the way through gestation, most likely from placental atrophy leading to premature separation of the placenta (Gomez et al., 2006). Generally, the reported losses were attributed to fetal death, externalization of the abdominal organs (omphalocoele), respiratory failure in the newborn, starvation due to inadequate suckling, or septicemia.",

Pregnancies were monitored by weekly (Jang et al., 2007; Hossein et al., 2009) or fortnightly (Jang et al., 2008) ultrasonography, and the puppies were delivered by C-section as a precaution because of larger singleton fetuses (Jang et al., 2007).

Pregnancy losses are elevated, as in cattle, and appear to occur at all stages of gestation, but LOS has not been reported. In one review of SCNT foals of five different genotypes born at the University of Texas, 54 embryos were transferred, from which 31 pregnancies were diagnosed at 11\u201315 days. Nine pregnancies were lost before day 90, 6 between 3 and 10 months, 2 between 10 and 11 months (gestation length is around 11 months in the horse), and 2 in the neonatal period, thus yielding 12 foals (22% of transferred embryos) that subsequently survived until adulthood (Johnson et al., 2010). Three mares delivered early (300\u2013312 days of pregnancy), and one delivered post-term (day 389). The authors recommended that mares should be monitored for foaling starting from day 300 of pregnancy. Most mares had the normal prepartum progestagen rise (Rossdale et al., 1991, Rossdale et al., 1995) and all foalings were normal, with no oversized foals or placental abnormalities (Johnson et al., 2010). Only six foals, however, were completely clinically normal at birth, all the others requiring neonatal care. Foals were all supplemented with colostrum and treated with oxygen immediately after birth (for up to 15 days for one foal). More or less severe symptoms of maladjustment were found in 6/14 foals born; enlarged umbilicus was present in 8/14, requiring omphalectomy in 4 foals. Limb deformities, valgus, and contracted tendons were also observed in 8/14, 4/14, and 7/14 foals, respectively. Therefore, SCNT foals should be considered as high risk and treated accordingly if needed.",

            "text": "Anecdotal evidence has always suggested a lower occurrence of symptoms for the abnormal offspring syndrome after goat cloning, with the appearance of significantly fewer pre- and postnatal abnormalities and losses than cattle or sheep, with no obvious birthweight effect (no large offspring). However, there are fewer reports on goat cloning abnormalities in the literature than for cattle, with detailed studies on causes of postnatal losses in cloned goats still lacking. Most studies report more than 80% of the prenatal losses occurring in the early stages (before day 60), with occasional cases of abortion more frequently seen between days 60 and 120 of gestation. Separate studies describe the occurrence of stillbirth and neonatal death, or death within the first weeks (Chen et al., 2007, Folch et al., 2009, Keefer et al., 2001, Tang et al., 2011), while some of the early reports on goat cloning claimed no neonatal losses or postnatal abnormalities (Baguisi et al., 1999, Behboodi et al., 2004, Keefer et al., 2002, Reggio et al., 2001), no significant blood chemistry differences between clones and control animals (Behboodi et al., 2005), and normal birth weights, with the occasional birth of small kids. The range of distinct morphological or clinical causes for morbidity and mortality described in the literature include iatrogenesis, respiratory failure and depression, pre-birth umbilical cord rupture, intrauterine infections, enlarged umbilical cord, cyanosis, myocardial damage and heart defects, tendon laxity, abnormal or stiff joints, abnormal abdominal wall closure, gastrointestinal problems, ectopic hematopoiesis in several tissues/organs, placental defects and lack of cotyledons in the fetal membranes (Nasr-Esfahani et al., 2011). In addition, specific goat cell lines used for cloning have been implicated in the appearance of organ abnormalities in the fetal heart, liver, and kidney; stillbirth; death at or after birth; behavioral abnormalities during development, such as aggressive feeding; and increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections (Baldassarre et al., 2004). Such problems tend to disappear after 1 year of age. Finally, the report on Dolly\u2019s death indicated that she died of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus infection, but that she was previously healthy (apart from arthritis, which was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs) and fertile (Rhind et al., 2004).",

Initially, up to 15 embryos were transferred into each recipient doe; however, given that some does carried triplet and quadruplet kids, it is now recommended that no more than 6 embryos be transferred into each recipient doe to minimize the risk of this occurring. Parturition was induced between 142 and 149 days of gestation by injections of PGF2\u03b1 and DEX. Kids were delivered approximately 36 hours later, the majority being healthy, active, and inquisitive, with no need of extraordinary care. Of those five that died in the perinatal period, the predominant cause was respiratory failure, while one was due to dystocia and meconium aspiration. The common abnormality of the SCNT kids was enlarged navels that required suturing to stop umbilical hemorrhage. One kid from a hydrops pregnancy with a detaching placenta died 48 hours after C-section delivery despite intubation and intensive care, whilst another kid survived from a hydrops pregnancy treated the same way.",

Furthermore, it is generally assumed that all cells in any one culture are homogenous and have the same ploidy, and that this holds true even after many passages, although there is no firm evidence supporting this. An examination of cell spreads from a few cultures of somatic cells that were grown for the purpose of SCNT showed obvious morphological heterogeneity in the cell populations (Lee, unpublished observations). We do not even know if the standard cell culture conditions are optimal for somatic cells that are to be used for SCNT. Although SCNT can work successfully with cells of different epigenetic states, we do not know if there is an \u201cideal\u201d epigenetic state that makes chromatin remodeling more successful for the regeneration of an entirely healthy animal. Finding the ideal somatic cell nuclei may be the key to improving the success rate of SCNT, but it is not easy to determine the exact state of that one cell which will go on to successfully produce a live healthy clone.",

Joint laxity or contracted flexor tendons occur in most ruminant species cloned to date. This all suggests common developmental pathways being affected in all species, whatever the species cloned. Whilst enlarged umbilical vessels and navels can be successfully remedied by suturing the navel at birth, the success rate for rescuing those with respiratory insufficiency is still poor, and the results are mixed for treating contracted flexor tendons.",

In addition to new treatments aimed at providing a better epigenetic reprogramming of the embryo at the time of cloning, more progress in fetal and postnatal health of clones may be achieved through careful selection and maturation of recipient oocytes, optimal maturation and embryo culture media, choice of the embryos transferred, and care of the maternal environment through the selection and nutrition of the recipient dam.",
