Podocytes have a voluminous cell body, which is at the central position of the cell and lies in the urinary space.

The foot processes of neighboring podocytes are bridged by slit diaphragm (SD), which is the site of convective fluid flow through the visceral epithelium and the final barrier to urinary protein loss. Similar to the apical membrane domain of podocytes, the SD is also covered by a thick surface coat mainly constituted by sialoglycoproteins, including podoendin, podocalyxin, and others, which are responsible for the high negative surface charge of the podocytes. In addition, several molecules, including ZO-1 (zonula occludens protein), nephrin, CD2AP (CD2-associated protein), FAT, and P-cadherin, have all been shown to be expressed within the SD, and some of those molecules play a major role for its integrity (Pavenstadt et al. 2003).",

The cytoskeleton is comprised by microfilaments (7\u20139 nm diameter), intermediate filaments (10 nm diameter), and microtubules (24 nm diameter), which are mainly defined by their diameter. Microtubules and intermediate filaments are predominant cytoskeletal constituents in the cell body and the primary processes. In the FPs, microfilaments are the main cytoskeletal component, which consist of a network with densely accumulated F-actin and myosin. FP actin cytoskeleton is extensively distributed in all three domains of FPs, resulting to an important role of actin for the function and dysfunction of podocytes. FP effacement requires the activation of actin filaments reorganization, a process which is regulated by multiple signaling events involving integrin activation, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and growth factor receptor, and calcium (Ca2+) influx pathways as upstream modulators of the actin cytoskeleton (Takeda et al. 2001).",

Transmembrane proteins such as nephrin and FAT constitute the rod-like units of SD which are connected by numerous linear bar, forming a network with pores the same size as or smaller than albumin (Mundel and Kriz 1995). Meanwhile, negatively charged apical domain of SD works as a charge barrier to prevent the albumin loss.

The damage of SD proteins contributes to cytoskeleton disorganization, leading to podocyte effacement and proteinuria (Shankland 2006). SD between adjacent podocytes is constituted predominantly by SD proteins including nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, Neph1, and FAT1. Mutations/abnormalities of those proteins result proteinuria and kidney disease. Studies have shown that SD proteins regulate cytoskeleton organization and podocyte shape by interacting with proteins associated with actin cytoskeleton.

Studies have demonstrated the correlation of podocytes reduction with the onset and progression of glomerulosclerosis. Because podocytes counteract the outward forces of glomerular pressures and maintain capillary loop shape, podocyte loss results to local bulging of the GBM when glomerular pressures increase in many renal diseases. The denuded GBM tends to form a synechia attachment by contacting with the parietal epithelial cells and Bowman\u2019s capsule, which is thought to be the first \u201ccommitted step\u201d of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) (Kriz et al. 1994, 1998a, b).",

The classic type of glomerulosclerosis, as defined by segmental obliteration of glomerular capillaries by the extracellular matrix, has been believed to progress to complete sclerosis without regression (Nagata 2016). In early stage of FSGS, cellular lesions including transformed podocytes were accompanied by segmental sclerosis, supporting the fact that podocyte damage might be an early event of glomerulosclerosis. In a recent elegant review by Kim JS and his colleagues, the essential steps of glomerulosclerosis were suggested as follows: (1) increased glomerular capillary pressure and filtration flow through podocyte slits, (2) foot process effacement as an adaptive response, (3) podocyte hypertrophy and glomerulomegaly, (4) mismatch between glomerular tuft growth and podocyte hypertrophy, (5) stretching and attenuation of podocyte cell body, (6) pseudocysts formation by hindered flow of filtrates beneath the podocyte that is partially detached on bare areas of GBM, (7) complete podocyte detachment by enlarged pseudocysts and adhesion to Bowman\u2019s capsule, (8) glomerular tuft\u2019s adhesion to Bowman\u2019s capsule, (9) spreading of filtrates to interstitium out of nephron through adhesion structure, and (10) interstitial proliferation and nephron degeneration (Kim et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Podocyte injury is a key factor in the development of DN. Recent studies in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have proposed that a reduction in the number of podocytes may lead to the development of proteinuria. It is reported that the structure and function of podocytes are abnormal under high glucose conditions, such as podocyte fusion, septal injury, and podocyte loss. There has been evidence that podocytes possess a completely functional system for glucose uptake (Lewko et al. 2005). Coward et al. have revealed that the cultured human podocytes express glucose transporter (GLUTs) in two forms: GLUT1 and GLUT4, which participate in insulin-dependent glucose transport to the cell (Coward et al. 2005, 2007). In addition, the podocyte split protein, such as Nefin, is also involved in glucose transport. Schiffer et al. have demonstrated that podocytes also express another insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT8 (Schiffer et al. 2005). GLUT1 is the primary glucose transporter in most cells as well as in podocytes (Coward et al. 2005, 2007). In diabetes, hyperglycemia and alteration of glucose transporter cause increased intracellular glucose concentration in podocyte and lead to severe impairment of the glomerular filtration barrier. Conversely, Zhang et al. found that enhancement of GLUT1 expression in diabetic podocyte significantly reduced the mesangial expansion and fibronectin accumulation by inhibiting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Zhang et al. 2010). Similarly to other cells, under high glucose condition, podocyte can undergo many pathological changes induced by aberrations in various cellular and molecular events. High glucose induces generation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased flux of polyols and hexosamines, increased activity of protein kinase C (PKC), upregulated expression of cytokines and growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), induces aberrant Notch signaling, and activates the renal RAS (Anil Kumar et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Pathomechanism of podocyte injury in DN mainly includes podocyte hypertrophy, EMT, podocyte detachment, and podocyte apoptosis. Podocyte hypertrophy is the initial stage of podocyte injury in early DN. Hyperglycemia upregulated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase p27kip1, which leads to further cell cycle arrest and hypertrophy. It was found that p27kip1-/- mice had significantly improved renal damage in DN (Wolf et al. 2005). Several studies suggested high glucose-induced podocyte hypertrophy by activating mTORC1 pathway (Fantus et al. 2016). In addition, hyperglycemia increased expression of nuclear STAT3 via the activation of the upstream signal transduction element Gp130, which eventually leads to podocyte hypertrophy. Excessive hypertrophy could result in degenerative changes in podocyte structure and functions, leading to its detachment from glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Previous studies have shown that phenotype conversion of podocyte was involved in the early stage of podocyte deletion in DN by inducing podocyte detachment or podocyte apoptosis. Podocyte EMT is a manifestation of podocyte phenotype conversion and one of the initiating factors leading to a variety of glomerular diseases. When EMT occurs, the cells lose their original characteristics, resulting in disappearance of intercellular contact, impaired cell polarity, and expression of mesenchymal markers such as alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1). EMT is also an explanation for podocyte depletion in DN (Yamaguchi et al. 2009). Emerging evidence suggested that podocytes could undergo EMT in DN, characterized by loss of epithelial features such as nephrin and P-cadherin, while expressing mesenchymal markers such as FSP-1, type I collagen, and fibronectin (Reidy and Susztak 2009). Xing et al. (2015) demonstrated that stimulation with high glucose for 48 h could activate the PI3 K/AKT pathway in podocyte, and thereby induce the protein expressions of \u03b1-SMA and desmin. Dai et al. (2012) suggested that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) were involved in high glucose-induced phenotypic alterations of podocytes. Lv et al. (2013) findings elaborated that Rac1/PAK1 signaling contributed to high glucose-induced podocyte EMT via promoting \u03b2-catenin and Snail transcriptional activities, which could be a potential mechanism involved in podocytes injury in response to stimuli under diabetic conditions. Guo et al. indicated high glucose can also activate \u03b2-catenin and Snail expressions by upregulating GSK-3\u03b2. In addition, hyperglycemia-induced podocyte detachment by decreasing the expression of key proteins involved in the foot process actin cytoskeleton, split diaphragm (SD) integrity, and podocyte\u2013GBM interactions. A3b1 integrins are the important transmembrane protein involved in anchoring foot processes in the GBM. High glucose regulates the expression of integrin subunits and inhibits the synthesis of agrin. Therefore, high glucose affects not only the structure of podocytes, but also their ability to adhere to GBM (Chen et al. 2000; Han et al. 2006; Yard et al. 2001). It is found that high glucose can alter podocyte adhesion by decreasing expression of integrin \u03b13\u03b21v which was an important receptor that could tightly connect podocyte with the GBM and participated in the adhesion function of podocyte. In addition, \u03b1-Actinin, an actin filament for protein crosslink, is also an important factor required for podocyte adhesions (Dandapani et al. 2007). High glucose and AGE treatment resulted in \u03b1-actinin-4 expression changes and induces cytoplasmatic translocation in podocyte (Ha 2006). There are some evidences that podocyte apoptosis played a role in reduction in density and number of glomerular in DN. High glucose led to podocyte apoptosis by increased production of ROS, activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, NF-kB, and p38 MAP kinase (Susztak et al. 2006; Szabo et al. 2006). In diabetes, the surface receptors of the AGEs are upregulated in the podocytes (Tanji et al. 2000). Binding AGEs to receptors activates activated transcription factor FOXO4, which also induced podocyte apoptosis via p38 protein kinase signaling pathways (Cohen et al. 2005). In addition, high glucose increased the protein expression of Nestin, which is a VI intermediate filament protein-related cell cytoskeleton, thereby increased podocyte apoptosis rate (Liu et al. 2012). High glucose increased the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in podocyte. TGF-\u03b21 could induce podocyte apoptosis by directly activate Smad7, p38 MAP kinase, and Notch pathway (Li et al. 2004).",

            "text": "In addition to its direct effects, elevated glucose may act indirectly, via the proinflammatory response, Ang II-dependent pathways, and lipid accumulation. Under high glucose conditions, secretion of the MCP-1 protein by cultured podocytes was increased rapidly (Han et al. 2004), and similar effect was observed in podocyte stimulated with AGEs (Gu et al. 2006). Podocyte can also express TNF-\u03b1, a cytokine produced by various immune cells, in response to high glucose stimulation and in diabetic conditions (Ikezumi et al. 2008; Ruster et al. 2009). High glucose could stimulate activity and expression of the local RAS components in podocyte, including Ang II and its AT1 receptors (Yoo et al. 2007). Following that, it was recently demonstrated that local RAS activation would lead to podocyte injury through a variety of pathways. Ang II could induce podocyte apoptosis through activation of NADPH oxidase and production of ROS, and upregulate the expression of GLUT transporters (Gill and Wilcox 2006; Nose et al. 2003). In addition, Ma et al. found that lipid accumulation in podocytes was increased under the high glucose stimulation, which is mediated through the disruption of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) pathway (Zhang et al. 2015a). Interestingly, reducing lipid accumulation in podocytes decreased the protein expression of SMA and increased the expression of nephrin in podocyte. These studies reveal that high glucose-induced lipid accumulation is involved in the podocyte injury in DN. Therefore, the above shows that high glucose could induce various other metabolic disorders and indirectly lead to podocyte injury.",

            "text": "Between neighboring podocytes, there is a unique interdigitating structure bridged by SD, maintaining the proper glomerular filtration (Ruotsalainen et al. 1999). Researches have revealed that SD is a lipid raft structure containing multiple podocyte-specific proteins, such as podocin and nephrin (Schermer and Benzing 2009). In particular, podocin can recruit and bind to cholesterol to form SD, and this binding can influence the composition of lipid membrane, allowing cholesterol to contact with the ion-channel transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) (Huber et al. 2006). This suggests that cholesterol homeostasis is essential for glomerular functions. However, excessive cholesterol can also negatively disrupt the mutual binding of podocyte SD proteins, or interfere with the binding between podocyte SD proteins and caveolin-1, a lipid raft-associated protein, binding nephrin, and Cluster of Differentiation 2 (CD20)-associated protein (Sorensson et al. 2002)",

The expression of HMGCR and LDLR is regulated by some transcription factors, such as the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), under negative feedback loops. When cells are rich in cholesterol or its derivatives, the transcription of LDLR gene or other genes necessary to lipid synthesis are suppressed. As a result, the cells are not able to generate and uptake cholesterol, and then establish cholesterol homeostasis. In contrast, when intracellular sterols are exhausted, the transcriptions of SREBP target genes will be activated, increasing intracellular cholesterol (Zhang et al. 2016). This enables cellular cholesterol homeostasis despite physiological fluctuations in cholesterol requirements and exogenous supply.",

It is demonstrated that human glomerular podocytes express ABCA1, HMGCR, and LDLR (Merscher-Gomez et al. 2013). Ma et al. found that some pathogenic factors such as inflammation can disrupt LDLR pathway (Zhang et al. 2015b). Thus, excessive lipid accumulates in podocytes, resulting in effacement of the foot processes and epithelial mesenchymal transition of podocytes (Zhang et al. 2015b). It is recently demonstrated that human podocytes treated with the sera from diabetic kidney disease (DKD) patients had increased cholesterol accumulation compared with human podocytes exposed to the sera of patients with diabetes, but no DKD. This was associated with a reduction of ABCA1 and an impairment of cholesterol efflux (Merscher-Gomez et al. 2013). Besides, it is showed that c-x-c motif ligand 16 (CXCL16) is the main scavenger receptor for oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in human podocyte (Gutwein et al. 2009). The expression of glomerular CXCL16 was increased in patients with membranous nephropathy, accompanied with higher levels of oxLDL (Gutwein et al. 2009). And in diabetic db/db mice, CXCL16 pathway was activated, in parallel with increased cholesterol accumulation in kidney (Hu et al. 2018). In vitro, oxLDL can induce loss of nephrin expression from cultured podocytes (Bussolati et al. 2005).",

            "text": "In the tubulointerstitial and glomerular segment of renal biopsies obtained from patients with DN, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is observed (Sieber et al. 2010). Importantly, in a T1D mouse model, the progression of DN can be attenuated by ameliorating ER stress (Qi et al. 2011). ER dyshomeostasis can decrease the ER folding capacity, thereby leading to accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins. This in turn initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR), adaptively maintaining proper ER function (Ma and Hendershot 2001). But if ER stress persists, apoptosis will be induced by the proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (Rasheva and Domingos 2009). In podocytes, ER stress induced by palmitic acid results in the upregulation of several UPR markers/effectors, such as the ER chaperone heavy chain-binding protein (BiP), and CHOP, while monounsaturated palmitoleic and oleic acids only upregulated BiP but not CHOP (Sieber et al. 2010). As BiP can attenuate palmitic acid-induced apoptosis (Laybutt et al. 2007), the beneficial effect of MUFAs may own to the upregulation of BiP. In addition to the unfolded proteins, alterations in ER membrane lipid composition can also sensitively affect the expression of the ER stress sensor inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) (Promlek et al. 2011). It is shown that small molecule compound 4m8C, specific IRE-1 inhibition, can attenuate palmitic acid-induced podocyte death (Sieber and Jehle 2014).",

In animal model of type 1 diabetes (T1D), increased expression of SREBP-1 in renal results in upregulation of enzymes responsible for FFA synthesis and as a consequence of a high level of triglyceride (TG) in renal (Hashizume and Mihara 2012). Accumulated lipids in podocytes limited mitochondrial fatty acids \u03b2-oxidation. It induced mitochondrial damage and inhibition of AMP kinase (AMPK) activity, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy, and apoptosis in podocytes. As a result, mitochondrial dysfunction caused decreased podocyte density and increased in foot process width, together with inflammation (Szeto et al. 2016). Renal accumulation of TG is associated with reduced expression of the ultrasensitive energy sensor AMPK strongly. This suggests that the imbalance between energy-generating and energy-consuming pathways might be related to podocyte dysfunction in DKD and other disorders in CKD, due to lipid accumulation (Wahl et al. 2016). And hypertriglyceridemia can also increase podocytic de novo expression of desmin, which represents podocyte injury (Joles et al. 2000).",

Cholesterol helps form SD between podocytes, maintaining the proper glomerular filtration. LDL-cholesterol uptake is mediated via the LDLR or CXCL16 and may cause ER stress.

Free fatty acids are primarily transported via CD36, causing oxidative and ER stress based on the degree of saturation. Sphingolipids and gangliosides also play a role in podocyte biology.

            "text": "Podocyte loss in hypertension includes detachment of viable cells and apoptosis (Kriz et al. 2013). The major factor for podocyte loss in hypertension is the capillary hypertension, which cause glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration (Kriz and Lemley 2015). Glomerular hypertrophy results in relatively decreased podocyte density. Puelles et al. (2016) examined the effect of hypertension on podocyte depletion using kidneys obtained from autopsy, and they did not observe a difference in total podocyte number solely driven by hypertension, while the relative podocyte depletion is associated with glomerular hypertrophy which resulted in the reductions in podocyte density. Hyperfiltration gives rise to increased shear stress by elevating driving force and augmenting GBM area. Podocytes cultured in vitro are sensitive to shear stress, which induces reorganization of cytoskeleton (Friedrich et al. 2006), and this helps them to cover an expanding GBM which further leads to foot process effacement. In desoxycorticosterone-trimethylacetate (DOCA) hypertensive mice, chloride intracellular channel 5A, which is highly enriched in podocytes foot process, protects against hypertension-induced podocyte injury through weakening the tensile strength of the actin cytoskeleton in Rac1-dependent manner (Tavasoli et al. 2016). This has been considered to be the protective response for podocyte to escape detachment. However, this strategy is not always successful and finally results in podocyte detachment from GBM, as seen in progressive stage of fawn-hooded hypertensive (FHH) (Kriz et al. 1998c) and DOCA hypertensive rat model (Kretzler et al. 1994). Apoptosis is another cause for podocyte loss under shear stress in hypertension, which is before or in conjunction with cell detachment (Kriz et al. 2013; Ying et al. 2000).",

            "text": "Besides mechanical stress, renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) plays central role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis, mainly through its actions on the subtype 1 receptor. Mechanical strain increased angiotensin II production and upregulation of angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) in cultured podocytes, while the increased apoptosis induced by mechanical strain was also in an angiotensin II-dependent manner (Durvasula et al. 2004). Increased angiotensin II results in decreased expression of podocin and integrin \u03b21, which are both vital in viable podocytes adhesion to the GBM and interaction of podocytes with other GBM components. This might elucidate that the elevated intraglomerular pressure is translated into a maladaptive response in podocyte probably due to the activation of local tissue angiotensin system. Furthermore, angiotensin II is also considered to be associated with the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (Macconi et al. 2000). Aldosterone, an important mediator of the effect of angiotensin, has become a hot spot concern in hypertensive nephropathy. Using only the inhibition of aldosterone by eplerenone dramatically alleviated podocyte injury in Dahl salt-hypertensive rats, an animal model inclined to hypertensive glomerulosclerosis (Nagase et al. 2006). In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, additional use of low-dose eplerenone to renin\u2013angiotensin system inhibitors has renoprotective effects in hypertensive patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (Ando et al. 2014). These findings suggested that aldosterone plays an important role in hypertension-induced podocyte injury. The underlying mechanism is primarily due to aldosterone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which increased oxidative stress. In uninephrectomized rats infused with aldosterone and fed with high-salt diet, podocyte-associated proteins nephrin and podocin were dramatically decreased, along with reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation, increased oxidative stress, and enhanced aldosterone effector kinase Sgk1. Thus, podocyte is the prominent target for aldosterone by inducing oxidative stress and Sgk1 (Shibata et al. 2007). Selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist eplerenone also ameliorated the salt-induced proteinuria and podocyte injury in hypertensive rat model (Nagase et al. 2007).",

Unfortunately, the detection of viable podocytes in the urine is a complex procedure, which is still unavailable in all laboratories. However, elevated mRNA levels of podocin and nephrin can be examined in urine of hypertensive patients (Kelder et al. 2012). Recent studies suggested that increased podocyte-derived extracellular vesicles may predict podocyte stress and subsequent podocyte loss in hypertensive patients, which might provide a novel non-invasive detective method (Kwon et al. 2017). Podocytes, as the gatekeepers of protein in glomerular filtration barrier, are major targets of high blood pressure. In all, hypertension could cause mechanical stress and the activation of RAAS (mentioned below). Mechanical stress further induces capillary hypertension, promoting glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration. These changes would lead to reduced podocyte density and the reorganization of cytoskeleton in podocytes, resulting in detachment of viable podocyte and podocyte apoptosis, progressing to final glomerulosclerosis. More studies are needed to prove that podocytes can be the detective marker for hypertensive nephrosclerosis and find the more specific method for early diagnosis and treatment.",

Stimulation of Ang II resulted in an immediate calcium influx of cultured podocytes (Greka and Mundel 2011). Studies have confirmed that TRPC6 colocalized with podocyte nephrin and podocin, and its functional mutation could disrupt the integrity of the pore membrane, leading to proteinuria and FSGS (Reiser et al. 2005; Winn et al. 2005). Numerous studies have found that abnormal calcium signaling may be the main cause of related podocyte diseases. For example, calcium increases evoked by Ang II are primarily mediated via TRPC6 channels and this pathway could be pharmacologically targeted to abate the development of DKD (Nijenhuis et al. 2011; Sonneveld et al. 2014).",

In vitro experiments, animal experiments, and human kidney biopsy indicate that podocytes have a high-level basis of autophagy, which plays an important role in maintaining the stability of podocytes. Recent research using a CKD animal model has demonstrated that autophagy is an essential intracellular process to encourage the survival of renal cells (Huber et al. 2012), while excessive and dysfunctional autophagy might result in podocyte injury (De Rechter et al. 2016). It has been found that Ang II could enhance the ROS production and increase oxidative stress in the renal system by enhancing the activity of systematic NADPH, leading to detrimental podocyte autophagy (De Rechter et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2010), the underlying pathways of which is dependent or independent on mTOR (Mao et al. 2016). A recent study has found that autophagy could enhance the cell viability of Ang II-treated podocytes, suggesting improving autophagy may become a new targeted therapy to relieve Ang II-induced podocyte injury (Gao et al. 2017).",

In vitro, NOD2 which was activated by bacterial component muramyl dipeptide in podocytes reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake and inhibited serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Another study has explored the role of other PRR toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the db/db mice model of DN. Administration of a selective TLR2/4/6 inhibitor GIT27 improved insulin sensitivity, reduced albuminuria and urinary nephrin levels, indicative of reduced podocyte damage. TLR4 expression in podocytes was found to be highest expressed (Cha et al. 2013). Given the links between some specific PRRs activation and insulin stimulation in podocytes, how podocyte insulin responses are altered following PRRs activation and inhibition may need specifically investigated.",

C3 activation can lead to decreased immune complex formation and increased disintegration. On the other hand, C3 activation leads to increased production of vasoactive molecules and chemokines, which in turn recruits more inflammatory mediators into the glomerulus. The activation of complement would produce proinflammatory components of complement, i.e., C5a.

The main pathogenesis of idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) is caused by the binding of IgG to the intrinsic antigen on the basement membrane side of glomerular podocytes, which combine to form an antigen\u2013antibody complex, thereby activating the complement-forming membrane attack complex (Takano et al. 2013). In IMN, the concentrations of complement cleavage products such as C3a, C5a and C5b-9 are significantly increased. C5b-9 is the final product of complement activation in three pathways of complement activation, causing podocyte injury not through conventional lysis, but probably via the mechanism related to the activation of corresponding intracellular signaling pathways in a subdissolved form. Ronco and Debiec have confirmed that the podocyte surface antigen megalin binded to the corresponding antibody underwent an immune complex reaction, activated the complement system, and promoted the formation of the membrane attack complex C5b-9 (Ronco and Debiec 2007). As a stimulant of podocytes, c5b-9 could destroy podocyte cytoskeletal proteins, inserting in the membrane to increase cell permeability, and activating a series of transduction pathways, resulting in the diffuse thickening of GBM and defects in glomerular filtration barrier, clinically leading to significant proteinuria.",

It has been found that B7-1 was expressed on podocytes of lupus nephritis (LN) (Reiser et al. 2004), and the expression of podocyte B7-1 in LN patients and LN mouse models is positively correlated with the degree of proteinuria. However, new evidence has stricken up a discordant tune (Baye et al. 2016), leading to further mandatory studies of the application of B7-1 blockers in treating proteinuric patients (Novelli et al. 2016a).",

Studies have shown that neonatal MN occurs due to the presence of anti-NEP auto-antibodies in children (Herrmann et al. 2012). Its origin is due to the mother\u2019s carrying the relevant mutation gene and lacking NEP. If the mother bred a normal healthy fetus, the mother will produce an anti-NEP antibody against the fetus during pregnancy and the antibody enters the fetus through the placenta. Anti-NEP antibodies react with NEP antigens on fetal podocytes, forming an immune complex on the epithelial side, leading to neonatal MN. Although the incidence of this type of patients is very low, its pathogenesis confirms the role of anti-podocyte antigen antibodies in the development of human MN (Pozdzik et al. 2015).",

Animal experiments have found that the injection of IL-8 to rats can reduce the content of heparin sulfate on the surface of podocytes, weaken the membrane filtration barrier of charge, and trigger proteinuria. There are also receptors for IL-4 and IL-13 on the podocyte, and the increase of circulating or local IL-4 and IL-13 can directly damage the podocyte through the receptors on the podocyte and increasing the permeability of the filtration membrane.",

However, due to the self-regulation of the body, podocytes can downregulate the expression of CD80. If the auto-regulatory function of podocytes and the body is defective, the sustained expression of CD80 would lead to proteinuria and even MCD. Moreover, Ishimoto et al. (2011) also observed increasing expression of CD80 in the urine of MCD patients; in view of the fact that the expression of CD80 in podocytes can be induced by IL-13 and bacterial products through the TLR pathway and regulated by CTLA4, suggesting that defective immune functions of podocytes is an essential cause of MCD.",

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) mostly manifests collapsing glomerulopathy or classic FSGS (Chandra and Kopp 2013). Podocyte infection is associated with podocyte injury and dedifferentiation and rapid loss of renal function. Studies have reported that HIV virus can be internalized by podocytes in vitro, which might be associated with receptors, such as viral coat protein gp120, and subsequent endocytosis, phagocytosis, or pinocytosis (Bruggeman 2017). Although the transmission of virus in vitro has been well documented, further studies are needed to demonstrate the definite mechanism by which the virus enters podocyte in vivo. Structural viral proteins, gag and pol, and non-structural proteins, vpr, nef, and tat, have been considered to be associated with HIVAN (Conaldi et al. 2002; Reid et al. 2001; Zuo et al. 2006). HBV is a major cause for membranous nephropathy and FSGS scarcely, which can be diagnosed by evidence of HBV antigen or antibodies on kidney biopsy. The possible mechanisms of HBV-induced podocyte injury might be as follows: detective infection of the cells by HBV, deposition of circulating immune complex in renal cells, effects of HBV-induced immunological mediators (Bhimma and Coovadia 2004; Sakai et al. 2011).",

As a vital type of renal intrinsic cells, podocyte damage is an important cause of nephrotic proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis. However, as a highly differentiated terminal cell, podocyte has no proliferative potential, and loss of podocyte is associated with poor renal outcomes such as increased proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and renal disease progression.",

Unanswered questions in the pathogenesis of podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis are still ill-defined, and the causing list will continue to grow.
