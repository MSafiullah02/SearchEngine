            "text": "Basic clinicopathological analyses include a complete blood cell count (CBC), serum biochemistry, and urinalysis. These tests, along with diagnostic imaging, help define the differential list generated from the physical examination. Furthermore, they can be helpful in determining the severity of disease, prognosis, and response to therapy with serial evaluation. Rarely, a specific disease is identified based on clinicopathological tests. Usefulness of the CBC includes the evaluation of the erythrogram and leukogram to characterize the severity of anemia, dehydration, and inflammatory response. Interpretation of the packed cell volume (PCV) should be done in conjunction with total protein concentration as well as the estimation of dehydration on physical examination. An anemic or dehydrated hypoproteinemic animal may have a normal PCV and total protein. Both the CBC and serum biochemistry can be helpful in determining the presence and severity of an inflammatory disease process. Changes in the total and differential white blood cell counts indicate acute or chronic inflammation, ranging from neutropenia and a degenerative left shift to a mature neutrophilia. Increases in globulins or fibrinogen suggest a chronic inflammatory disease. Low protein levels, especially albumin, need to be further evaluated for the potential of chronic blood loss due to gastrointestinal parasitism, infiltrative bowel disease, liver dysfunction, third-space compartmentalization, or protein loss through the kidneys. Liver disease should be suspected if liver enzymes or bilirubin levels are increased. However, liver enzyme concentrations can be normal in the presence of chronic liver disease. Also, albumin levels rarely drop in ruminants with liver disease as they do in other species. Liver function tests may be performed, including measurement of bile acids and blood ammonia concentrations. Point-of-care (POC) meters for the stall-side measurement of blood glucose, L-lactate, and ketone concentrations have been evaluated in cattle and small ruminants.1., 2., 3., 4. Urine strips for the detection of ketone bodies are also useful in monitoring ewes and does at risk for pregnancy toxemia. Changes in electrolytes are common with gastrointestinal diseases, especially in anorexic animals or those with profound diarrhea. Electrolyte measurements are also useful in the formulation of treatment plans. Although abomasal disease is rare in small ruminants, a metabolic alkalosis with hypochloremia and hypokalemia may be observed. Gastrointestinal stasis can result in hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and a mild hypocalcemia. In the case of surgical intestinal obstructions, small ruminants can develop severe metabolic acidosis due to ischemic necrosis of tissues and shock. The major biochemical changes commonly associated with diarrhea are metabolic acidosis, with the loss of sodium and bicarbonate in diarrheic feces, and the presence of azotemia and hypoproteinemia. Renal disease should be ruled out in these cases.",

            "text": "Rumen fluid analysis is useful in characterizing the health of the forestomach and aids in differentiation of diseases, including types of vagal indigestion, ruminal acidosis, and potential intoxications. Collection of rumen fluid can be via orogastric or nasogastric intubation or percutaneous rumenocentesis. Regardless of method chosen, proper restraint of the animal and suitable equipment (Figure 5.1\n) should be used to avoid trauma to the esophagus or abdominal viscera and damage of equipment (e.g., chewed tubes). To perform percutaneous rumenocentesis, a 16- to 18-gauge, 3-inch (7.6-cm) needle is inserted into the rumen fluid below the fiber mat. The site for rumenocentesis can be estimated by ballottement or percussion of the left flank (approximately 5\u201310 cm caudal to the last rib along an imaginary line drawn at the level of the patella)5 or, alternatively, at a ventral location caudal to the xiphoid and to the left of midline.6 Use of sedation and/or a local block with 2% lidocaine may be necessary in fractious or patients likely to struggle. The site is clipped and aseptically prepared. The needle is introduced forcefully, in one swift motion. Once the rumen is entered, fluid is aspirated with a syringe. If the needle becomes obstructed with ingesta, a small amount of air or fluid should be forced backed through the needle. Rumenocentesis carries the advantage of avoiding salivary contamination of the sample, which can occur during orogastric intubation, as well as possibly being less stressful to the animal. The procedure does carry a slight risk of peritonitis, which is minimized through proper restraint. Rumenocentesis is contraindicated in pregnant females.5\n,\n6\n",

            "text": "Once collected, rumen fluid is analyzed for color, odor, pH, motility and types of protozoal species present, methylene blue reduction (MBR) time, Gram-staining characteristics, and chloride concentration. Normal rumen fluid characteristics are listed in Table 5.1\n. The pH of rumen fluid can be measured on pH strips with 0.5 increments or the use of sophisticated handheld meters. The sample pH will be falsely increased with salivary contamination.7 Microscopic examination of a drop of fresh, warm fluid under a cover slip examined at 40\u00d7 to 100\u00d7 allows visualization of protozoa species, with no special staining required (Figure 5.2\n). Routine Gram staining is performed on a dried, fixed slide.5 The MBR reflects the activity of bacterial fermentation in the rumen. It is performed by mixing 1 mL of 0.03% methylene blue with 20 mL of rumen fluid at normal body temperature and measuring the time required to return to the appearance of a control tube.5 Rumen chloride concentrations can be determined from the supernatant of a centrifuged sample. Rumen chloride concentrations are minimally impacted by saliva contamination and a time lag between sample collection and analysis.5 Normal rumen fluid is aromatic, olive to brownish-green, and has a pH between 6.5 to 7.5 depending on the diet fed. Microorganisms include a mixed population of large and small protozoal species with active motility and a predominance of gram-negative rods. Normal rumen chloride concentration is less than 30 mEq/L and MBR should be less than 6 minutes.6 Changes observed in anorexic ruminants include thinner, darker fluid, with an increase in pH (7\u20137.5), and a reduction in the species and motility of protozoa present. In acute ruminal acidosis, the fluid is fetid, yellow to grey, with a low pH (< 5.2), and dead or no protozoa are present with a predominance of gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus species).5\n,\n8 The MBR is prolonged with any type of indigestion/digestive disorder in which inactivity of the microflora is present. Increased rumen chloride concentrates indicate an abomasal or proximal small intestinal obstruction, either functional or mechanical, as a result of the internal reflux of hydrochloric acid from the abomasum into the reticulorumen.9\n",

            "text": "Abdominocentesis is useful in the assessment of abdominal disease in ruminants and aids in the differentiation and diagnosis of ascites, peritonitis, strangulating intestinal lesions, enteritis, uroperitoneum, and abdominal neoplasia. There is normally a small amount of transudative fluid present in the peritoneal space. Characterization of peritoneal fluid as a transudate (low protein concentration and cell count), modified transudate (normal or mild increase in cell count with increased protein concentration), or exudate (increased protein concentration and cell count) is important from a pathophysiological standpoint and allows refinement of possible differentials for the abdominal disease present. Characteristics of peritoneal fluid from healthy sheep and goats are similar to cattle: transparent, colorless to slightly yellow, < 5 g/dL protein, and less than 5000 to 10,000 cells/mL.10\n,\n11 Peritoneal fluid protein concentration can be measured using a refractometer. Other biochemical analyses may include determination of creatinine (e.g., to diagnose uroperitoneum), L-lactate, D-dimer, and glucose concentrations.12\n,\n13 Cytologic examination is needed to characterize the types of cells present, the morphology of those cells, and to assess the presence of phagocytized bacteria. Typically, the cell population is made up of large mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and non-degenerative neutrophils. Lymphocytes comprise < 20% of cells present, and a few mast cells or plasma cells may be seen.10 Both the absolute number and proportion of cell types present need to be considered. Changes in peritoneal fluid cytology following exploratory laparotomy, rumenotomy, and enterotomy are reported in goats.14., 15., 16. Two methods can be used. The first technique involves tapping the cranial abdomen at its lowest point cranial to the umbilicus and slightly to the right of midline (Figure 5.3\n). This technique is useful in conditions with a significant amount of free fluid such as uroperitoneum. When using the cranial abdominal site, one needs to avoid the prepuce in males and the mammary veins in females.6 The second technique is a four-quadrant approach, as ruminants are very proficient at walling off inflammatory and infectious foci (e.g., peritonitis), which can hinder successful fluid collection. The two cranial sites are slightly caudal to the xiphoid and medial to the milk veins on both sides. The two caudal sites are slightly cranial to the mammary gland and to the left and right of midline.5 For either technique, manual restraint with sedation is recommended; the use of real-time ultrasonography may help locate fluid pockets. Importantly, amniocentesis or allantocentesis can occur at these sites during gestation and caution is warranted.",

The site should be clipped and prepped using sterile technique and local anesthesia provided when a teat cannula is used. Fluid should be collected in an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube for cytological analysis and a sterile red top tube or suitable inoculation vial for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Abdominal fluid can be difficult to obtain because of the small amounts normally present in both small ruminants. It is important to minimize the ratio of EDTA to fluid in the sample because EDTA can falsely increase the protein levels. Using EDTA tubes made for small animals, filling tubes to at least one-quarter full, or shaking excess EDTA out of large tubes resolves this problem. Air-dried, unstained slides should be prepared and shipped with EDTA tubes for samples shipped to an external laboratory for analysis.10\n",

            "text": "Ultrasonography is well suited for examination of the ruminant GIT and other abdominal viscera. Ultrasonography allows the characterization of contour, dimensions, content, and motility patterns of the forestomach and intestines, as well as the presence of masses, intraluminal and free abdominal fluid, and lesions within the parenchyma of abdominal viscera. Ultrasonography also can be used to guide fluid and tissue sampling for abdominocentesis and biopsy of organs or masses, respectively.20 Normal parameters for the forestomach compartments, small and large intestines, liver, and spleen have been described in small ruminants.21\n,\n22 Imaging is best achieved using a linear or convex transducer with a frequency of 3.5 to 5.0 MHz. The reticulum is imaged in the cranioventral abdomen, bilaterally, as a crescent-shaped structure immediately adjacent to the diaphragm. Goats demonstrate monophasic, biphasic, and triphasic reticular contractions.23 The rumen is visualized in the 8th through 12th intercostal spaces (ICS) and flank on the left, and from the 12th ICS and flank on the right. The rumen wall appears as a thick echoic line, and the ability to differentiate the gas cap, fiber mat, and fluid layer is variable. Rumen motility is discerned indirectly by changes seen in layering of the ruminal content. The dorsal and ventral rumen sacs are most easily distinguished caudally by the presence of the longitudinal groove.24 The omasum is found on the right side from the 6th to 11th ICS (mainly in the 8th and 9th ICS), appears as a crescent-shaped echoic line medial to the liver, and moves passively with respiration due to its proximity to the diaphragm. Due to the gaseous nature of omasal content, the omasal leaves and omasal wall furthest from the transducer cannot be visualized.25 The abomasum is visualized along the ventral midline and to the left and right paramedian areas as a heterogeneous, moderately echoic structure with echogenic stippling. Visualization of abomasal folds as prominent echoic bands is possible in approximately two-thirds of goats.26 Examination of the small intestine takes place from the 8th to 12th ICS and the flank on the right side, from dorsal to ventral midline. Similarly, the large intestine (i.e., spiral colon and cecum) is visualized in the right flank. The descending duodenum can be differentiated based on proximity to abdominal wall and location between two serosal layers of greater omentum, whereas the jejunum and ileum cannot be differentiated from each other. Normal luminal diameters and wall thickness of the small intestine are described in normal goats.27 The spiral colon and cecum are visible in the caudal right flank. The spiral colon often located medial to the small intestine, is garland-like in appearance, and visualization of only the wall closest to the transducer is possible due to intraluminal gas, which is also true of the cecum.27 Ultrasonography of the liver for position, parenchymal and surface appearance, as well as visualization of the caudal vena cava, portal vein, and gall bladder are evaluated on the right side between the seventh and ninth ICS (largest visible extent of liver) and variably between the fifth to sixth and the 10th to 12th ICS. The parenchymal pattern of the normal liver consists of numerous fine, homogeneous echoes (Figure 5.4\n). On cross-section, the caudal vena cava is triangular in shape and is visualized in approximately 75% of goats in the 11th and 12th ICS. The portal vein always has a more ventral position and is closer to the liver surface compared with the caudal vena cava. It is circular to oval in cross section, with stellate ramifications into the liver parenchyma, and typically is visualized in all ICS in which liver is visible. The gall bladder is variable in shape and size, depending on amount of bile present and is visualized in most goats from the 9th to 10th ICS.28 The spleen is visualized on the left side from the 11th and 12th ICS, situated between the rumen and abdominal wall. The parenchymal pattern consists of numerous, homogeneous, weak echogenic shadows.29 Description of ultrasonography of the urinary and female and male genital tracts can be found in Chapters 12 and 8, respectively.30\n",

General anesthesia is recommended to allow more inflation of the abdominal cavity and thus a more thorough examination, but laparoscopy can be done with sedation and local anesthesia at portal incision sites. The technique for laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen used for cattle and llamas can be modified for use in sheep, goats, and cervids.18., 19., 20., 21. Laparoscopic evaluation of the abdominal cavity is usually done via a ventral approach with the animal secured in dorsal recumbency. The abdominal cavity can be inflated with CO2 by a needle, teat cannula, or after placement of a laparoscopic cannula. A time-saving method is to use suture to make a \u201cbite\u201d through the skin and into the external rectus sheath which can be used to tense the body wall. A stab incision can then be made in the skin and external rectus sheath before introducing a guarded trocar into the abdominal cavity while tensing the abdominal wall with the previously placed suture. The laparoscope can then be placed through the trocar and the abdomen inflated while visualized through the scope. The clinician places the cannula in the inguinal area as described for laparoscopic insemination (see Chapter 8). This technique allows a more efficient use of time and minimizes the likelihood that the omentum will be \u201cballooned\u201d. Laparoscopic placement into the right side allows visualization of most of the abdominal organs (Figure 5.5\nA, B, C). Obviously, the clinician should avoid the rumen when introducing the laparoscope into the abdomen. This procedure may be enhanced by lowering the head or rear of the animal, allowing better visualization of the entire abdomen. Visualization of the abdominal cavity and the ability to manipulate organs will be greatly improved by fasting the animal 24 to 48 h or at least decreasing the bulk in the diet. Respiration must be monitored closely, and assisted ventilation should be available during this procedure because inflation of the abdomen and lowering of the head can put pressure on the diaphragm.",

The recommended biopsy site is the ninth intercostal space slightly above an imaginary line drawn from the point of the elbow to the craniodorsal angle of the paralumbar fossa (Figure 5.6\n).6 Other techniques, including laparoscopic liver biopsy are described.35., 36., 37., 38., 39.

A 14-gauge, 11.5-cm liver biopsy instrument (e.g., Tru-Cut biopsy needle) is inserted through the incision and the intercostal muscles and into the liver. The biopsy instrument is directed toward the opposite elbow, but the use of real-time ultrasonography greatly aids in determining the direction and depth needed (2 to 4 cm).5 Perforation of the gall bladder as well as large vessels along the caudal border of the rib should be avoided. Samples can be submitted for culture (in a sterile plastic or glass tube), histopathologic study (in formalin, at a 10:1 ratio of formalin to tissue), or mineral analysis (in a trace element or plastic tube). The laboratory should be contacted for appropriateness of sample containers and specific instructions. When performing a liver biopsy for mineral analysis, the clinician should rinse the biopsy site with distilled and deionized water after sterile preparation to minimize sample contamination. Samples for mineral analysis should not be placed in formalin. Closure of the skin incision can be accomplished by suture or stapling, or if it is small enough, the wound can be left alone to heal by second intention. Fly repellent should be applied to the site as needed. Use of antimicrobials is at the discretion of the veterinarian, and should be considered in regions where Clostridium novyi or Clostridium haemolyticum are prevalent.39 Vaccination status for clostridial diseases should be up-to-date, and if there is any doubt, a toxoid vaccine given before or at the time of biopsy.",

Bloat-promoting forages are prone to rapid cell disruption and degradation with the release of soluble proteins and other constituents. The highly soluble plant protein ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is especially important in contributing to the formation of stable foam in the rumen.46\n,\n47 This entrapment of gas within the rumen contents is the primary cause of frothy bloat. The stable foam prevents the coalescence of gas bubbles as well as the clearance of the cardia, impairing eructation. Frothy bloat can also occur on high-grain diets with limited roughage content. Plant factors that suppress bloat include condensed tannins, higher stem to leaf ratios, and plant lipids.",

For example, deer have a high concentration of proline-rich tannin-precipitating protein in their saliva, as well as alterations in rumen microflora that accommodate high tannin-containing diets.

This alters the rumen fluid viscosity and allows a stable slime (or foam) to form.42\n,\n43 Compounding the issue is a reduction in the amount of saliva contributing to the rumen liquor due to reduced rumination on diets lacking adequate fiber.

The introduction of high-concentrate diets with rapidly fermentable sugars and starches leads to unbalanced ruminal fermentation and the accumulation of lactic acid.60 Initially, the excess fermentable carbohydrates cause a general increase in the growth rate of all bacteria with a resultant increase in volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, which lowers ruminal pH. Bacterial species tolerant of lower ruminal pH, specifically Streptococcus bovis, outpace other bacterial species, resulting in increased lactate production. An increase in lactate concentration further decreases the rumen pH, and eventually it falls to a level where death of protozoa and gram-negative bacterial spp. occurs. In addition, the growth of S. bovis is inhibited and only very acid tolerant lactate-producing Lactobacillus spp. predominate. The rumen pH can decrease to 5, and in severe cases to less than 4.0. Lactate production (L- and D-isoforms) continues to increase.61\n,\n62 The osmolality of the rumen fluid increases which pulls fluid from the systemic circulation and interstitium into the rumen. Stasis of reticulorumen motility, mucosal damage, and absorption of lactic acids, inflammatory mediators, as well as bacteria and endotoxins into the peripheral circulation results.63., 64., 65. Clinically, dehydration, hypovolemic shock, acute inflammatory response, and metabolic acidosis result.63 Depending on the severity of metabolic derangement, thiamine deficiency and the development of polioencephalomalacia (PEM) can occur.66 Sequelae of severe ruminal acidosis or recurrent bouts of subacute ruminal acidosis may include laminitis, mycotic ruminitis, and occasionally liver abscessation; although, the latter is far more common in cattle than in small ruminants.65\n,\n67., 68., 69.\n",

Use of IV isotonic crystalloids supplemented with bicarbonate should be administered. Ideally, bicarbonate supplementation would be based on serum biochemistry analysis but can be empirically based on estimated base deficit. In certain instances, calcium may be indicated and can be added to the IV fluids (as calcium gluconate). The clinician should avoid mixing calcium salts and sodium bicarbonate. Administration of parenteral NSAIDs to alleviate pain and potentiate toxemia are indicated (e.g., flunixin meglumine 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg, IV). Use of parenteral antibiotics is indicated in most cases, given a high likelihood of bacterial translocation and bacteremia. The systemic antimicrobial of choice is penicillin (procaine penicillin G, 22,000 IU/kg, IM, q12h, or potassium penicillin 22,000 IU/kg, IV, q6h) due to anaerobes being the most likely offending organisms. Use of oral fluids to restore hydration is contraindicated and counterproductive, as fluid absorption is impaired, and administration can worsen rumen distention and abdominal discomfort. Administration of agents to neutralize the rumen pH, such as magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide (1 g/kg, PO) can be sufficient in mild cases. However, if much of the feed is still in the rumen, these two alkalinizing agents will only work temporarily. The use of oral antibiotics is likely counterproductive, as their administration negatively impacts the regrowth of the healthy rumen microflora. Oral antibiotics are contraindicated as they have poor bioavailability (e.g., neomycin). If available, the animal should be transfaunated daily with rumen fluid from a healthy donor until rumen motility and appetite are restored. More effective, is the prompt removal of the offending feedstuff in order to curtail fermentation. Ruminal lavage is likely futile in most small ruminants, given the size limitation of orogastric tubes to allow sufficient bore diameter without becoming blocked with feed. Rumenotomy is indicated in severe cases of ruminal acidosis to remove the offending feed.",

Crude fiber levels lower than this can be fed for short periods if the rumen is properly adapted, but problems may nevertheless occur. In sheep and goats unaccustomed to high-concentrate rations, gradual introduction to increasing rates of inclusion should take place over several weeks, to allow for adaptation of the rumen microflora. In addition to a well-formulated ration, inclusion of rumen modifiers such as buffers, yeasts, and direct-fed microbials may also be utilized. Rumen buffers may improve milk production, increase feed intake, and increase rate of gain. Sodium bicarbonate probably is the most commonly used buffer; it can be offered on a free-choice basis or included in the diet as 1% of dry matter intake.

The selective grazing and browsing habits of sheep and goats, respectively, likely limit the intake of sharp, metallic objects such as wire, nails, and needles. Goats appear to be affected more commonly than sheep.77 Penetration of a foreign body through the reticular wall can result in reticulitis, localized or diffuse peritonitis, abscessation and adhesion formation, as well as the development of pleuritis, pericarditis, or myocarditis if the foreign body penetrates the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity. Clinical signs include depression, anorexia, poor body condition, reluctance to ambulate, altered rumen motility (e.g., bloat, vagal indigestion), and abdominal pain.78 Involvement of the pleura or pericardium can present with signs of respiratory distress and heart failure.79 Abscessation and draining tracts of the thorax and forelimbs may be present.77 A thorough workup is required to determine the cause of vagal indigestion and the potential internal sites involved. This may include the use of radiographs and ultrasound, as these imaging modalities will help determine the extent of infection and the most suitable approach to treatment. An exploratory laparotomy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Physical examination and diagnostics will direct the surgical approach used (e.g., left versus right flank), as well as the need for a rumenotomy.

The decision to perform a standing left or the right flank, or use of other positions in recumbency, will be dictated by physical examination, clinicopathological tests, and the temperament and stability of the patient. A standing or recumbent left flank celiotomy and rumenotomy is suited for type II vagal indigestion (e.g., hardware disease, perireticular abscess). A right-sided approach (right flank, right paramedian, or right paracostal) for exploratory celiotomy is suitable for type III and IV vagal indigestion (e.g., abomasal impaction, pyloric obstruction). Many small ruminants may become recumbent during a standing flank approach. Recumbency can be facilitated by using a lumbosacral epidural anesthesia and sedation or by inhalant general anesthesia in very fractious animals. In nonemergent situations, the rumen fill should be minimized by withholding feed for 24 h. However, many cases present as an emergency. Perioperative antibiotics should be administered and be efficacious against anaerobes. Examples commonly used include procaine penicillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g., flunixin meglumine, meloxicam) is indicated perioperatively.

            "text": "A routine vertical incision is made through the skin and abdominal muscles in the middle of the left paralumbar fossa. Because the abdominal wall is relatively thin, and the rumen may be very distended, the surgeon should take care not to enter the rumen or bowel. To allow exploration and potential evaluation of the rumen, the body wall incision must be of adequate size to allow the surgeon\u2019s hand and forearm to comfortably enter the rumen without undue tension on the rumen wall. Once secured and incised, the rumen incision will be smaller than the body wall incision and should be considered. Thorough exploration of the abdomen should take place before the rumenotomy is performed (and is absolutely contraindicated after the rumenotomy is performed). Attention should be paid as to the presence of adhesions and perireticular abscesses while palpating the diaphragm and reticulum. After abdominal exploration, the rumen is secured to the skin by creating a watertight seal with continuous suture. The watertight seal is critical in preventing abdominal contamination. A monofilament (or coated) type of suture on a cutting needle should be used in a Cushing\u2019s pattern. It is important to exteriorize a generous part of the dorsal rumen sac to facilitate the creation of the rumenotomy without disrupting the rumen-to-skin seal. To prevent or minimize leakage, the rumen suture bites should be through the seromuscular layer but should not penetrate the mucosa, which could lead to leakage at closure. The suture line is started dorsally at the 12 o\u2019clock position and continued ventrally until the 6 o\u2019clock position is reached. A similar suture line is started on the other side dorsally and continued ventrally, overlapping with the initial suture line to prevent gapping and abdominal contamination at the 6 o\u2019clock position. Two separate suture lines are used to limit the circumferential decrease in lumen size created by one suture line pulled tightly. Once the rumen is sutured to the skin, the rumen-skin suture line is carefully checked for a good seal (Figure 5.8\n). The rumenotomy incision is then made in the center of the exposed, secured rumen (Figure 5.9\n). The rumenotomy incision should be large enough to allow entry of the surgeon\u2019s hand into the rumen, but care must be taken to ensure inadvertent incision of the skin-rumen seal does not take place (e.g., 3-cm ventral to 12 o\u2019clock position and extending to 3-cm dorsal to the 6 o\u2019clock position). Once the rumen has been secured and opened, no other modifications should be made to the rumenotomy. Depending on the character of the rumen contents, the rumen can be evacuated by hand or by creating a siphon with a large-bore stomach tube. The surgeon then explores the reticulum and rumen in its entirety, ensuring palpation of the ruminoreticular fold, esophageal orifice, and omasal orifice. All foreign bodies should be removed, regardless of whether they are penetrating or nonpenetrating. To facilitate finding ferromagnetic foreign bodies, a magnet can be held in the surgeon\u2019s hand while sweeping the reticular wall. An ultrasound probe (5-MHz sector) within a rectal sleeve can also be taken into the rumen to help identify adhesions and abscesses. Advancement of a hand through the reticulo-omasal canal is not typically feasible in small ruminants but may cautiously be attempted in large sheep and goats. Confirmed perireticular abscesses tightly adherent to the reticulum can be opened into the reticulum using sharp incision.",

Surgeon preference may dictate the use of a double-layer inverting pattern as described by Niehaus.87 Once the initial layer of rumen closure is complete, the site is copiously lavaged with sterile saline. All soiled materials (e.g., gloves, gowns, drapes) are then removed and replaced, and sterile instruments used in the second part of closure. The second layer of the rumen closure is with absorbable suture in an inverting pattern (e.g., Cushing, Lembert). Suture of this second layer should start at the 12 o\u2019clock position of the rumen incision, and retention sutures securing the rumen to the skin are removed as needed to free enough rumen for closure. When the second layer closure (Figure 5.10\n) is complete, the rumen is cleaned with moist sponges before being returned to the abdominal cavity. Again, it is emphasized that exploration of the abdominal cavity at this point is associated with an increased incidence of septic peritonitis and is contraindicated. The muscle and skin are inspected for gross contamination and cleansed with moist gauzes as needed. Routine closure of the muscle layers and skin are performed, based on surgeon\u2019s preference. Given that some contamination will occur during the procedure, incisional infections should be anticipated. The ventral aspect of the skin closure should include two to three interrupted sutures to allow drainage, if necessary, postoperatively.\n",

Use of intravenous formulations of H2-antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., pantoprazole) may be attempted in sheep and goats but likely are cost prohibitive.105\n,\n106 Diet formulations contributing to underlying mucosal damage should be addressed. Buffers can be added to the feed.",

The duration ranges from several days to months. The disease is frequently reported in the post-lambing period (within 30 days), although it appears variable in onset relative to parturition and is reported in rams.109\n,\n110 Although Suffolk is the predominant breed, cases in two Hampshire, one Dorset, and one Texel sheep are reported.111., 112., 113. It is considered sporadic in occurrence, but herd outbreaks have been documented.114 The underlying cause is unknown. Based on histological changes observed in the celiacomesenteric ganglion of affected sheep, a proposed pathophysiologic mechanism is alteration of autonomic innervation. Observed lesions, affecting only sympathetic nerves, suggest exposure to an excitotoxin resulting in an acquired dysautonomia.114 Unlike abomasal impaction, this disease is due to increases in concentrate feeding associated with diet changes occurring at the time of lambing. The clinical signs are chronic weight loss, abdominal distention, and anorexia. Clinicopathologic laboratory findings reflect dehydration and metabolic alkalosis with hypochloremia. Rumen chloride concentration is increased due to abomasal reflux. Liver enzymes are increased in most cases, reflecting an increase in intra-abdominal pressure and impairment of the liver\u2019s vasculature which results in congestion, ischemia, and leakage of enzymes from damaged hepatocytes.115 At necropsy, the abomasum is markedly distended, and the contents may be liquid or dry in character. Attempted treatment has included the use of laxatives, cathartics, motility modifiers (e.g., metoclopramide, neostigmine), and abomasotomy, with poor short- and long-term outcomes reported. The disorder carries a poor to grave prognosis.109\n",

Table 5.2\nlists the agents most likely to cause diarrhea in lambs and kids, tissues or other samples required for diagnosis, and commonly used test methods. The color and consistency of the feces and any gross lesions can appear similar with numerous diseases. Laboratory identification of infectious agents and tissue histopathologic examination are therefore key to establishing a diagnosis (see Chapters 16 and 20). Because autolysis and secondary bacterial invasion of the gut begin within minutes of death, necropsy samples taken immediately from euthanized lambs and kids yield the most reliable diagnostic material. Mixed infections with two or more pathogens are common, and clinically important farm-specific pathogens change from year to year.126., 127., 128., 129., 130. In some cases, an underlying nutritional deficiency or excess may be present, concurrently with infective disease. The clinician should therefore take a variety of samples to ensure identification of all pathogens and predisposing factors involved; continued reevaluation of the causes of diarrhea is crucial. Evaluation of material from multiple cases, with a focus on those in the acute phases, is important. Although examination of antemortem fecal samples can be diagnostic, laboratory testing of tissue samples may yield better results.",

After the organism attaches to the villi, it produces the second virulence factor, enterotoxin. Enterotoxin interferes with the normal physiology of the gut, with resultant diarrhea.131 Calves have an age-associated resistance that probably is related to the blocking of fimbrial attachment to the gut, so ETEC diarrheal disease occurs mainly in calves younger than 1 week of age.132\n,\n133 The mode of infection is fecal-oral.",

Nutritional problems can result in diarrhea, but cases related to nutrition are underreported in the literature because the resulting diarrhea usually is mild and subsides without treatment. Nutritional diarrhea is most common in orphaned animals and usually is a result of improper management practices such as use of poor-quality milk replacers, mixing errors, or infrequent feeding of large amounts (see Chapter 2). Diarrhea resulting from consumption of lush pasture or high-energy rations also is commonly seen and usually is self-limiting. The incidence of this form of gastric upset can be minimized by a slow introduction (over 2\u20133 weeks) to energy-dense diets.",

Animals with only mild diarrhea, especially mild nutritional diarrhea, may not require therapy unless they become dehydrated. If kids or lambs become less than 8% dehydrated and are only mildly depressed but still willing to nurse, they can be treated with oral electrolytes designed for calves. Fluids can be administered by bottle or by feeding tube (\u223c 18- to 24-inch, 3/8-inch diameter, catheter tip) if the animal will not nurse. The keeper or the clinician should carefully adjust the amount of fluids for lambs and kids (250\u2013500 mL [8\u201316 oz], as opposed to 4 L in a calf). Because most electrolyte solutions designed for calves contain glucose, they should be refrigerated after they have been mixed and any leftovers discarded within 24 h. IV fluids may be needed to treat more severe dehydration. If the lamb or kid is too weak to stand, IV fluids are indicated. Isotonic fluids containing electrolytes should be given to replenish losses. Glucose can be added to make a 1 to 2.5% solution. Sodium bicarbonate also may be administered, especially if the dehydration is severe. A rule of thumb is to give one-fourth of the calculated fluid needed as isotonic bicarbonate (1.3%). Extra potassium (10\u201320 mEq/L) can be added to fluids, because most animals are severely dehydrated from diarrhea and depleted in potassium, even though their blood potassium levels may be elevated. If extra potassium is added, acidosis must be corrected concurrently. After correcting the dehydration, the keeper or the clinician can offer oral electrolyte-enriched fluids to replace ongoing losses caused by continued diarrhea (see also Chapter 3).",

Antimicrobial agents should be reserved for proven outbreaks of salmonellosis and for animals with other causes of diarrhea that do not respond to fluid therapy and NSAIDs; these drugs should be administered only parenterally. Oral coating agents and antacids are popular, but such agents have not been shown to be beneficial, and their use is not therapeutically logical in light of the pathogenesis of these diseases. The therapeutic use of probiotics is questionable, but anecdotal reports suggest they may be beneficial in reestablishing the normal flora of the small intestine.

A normal lamb or kid will stand and nurse within 45 minutes to 1 h of birth. The ingestion of colostrum within 2 to 3 h is essential in preventing hypothermia and hypoglycemia and decreasing the incidence of various diseases. Lambs or kids born as twins or triplets, weak or injured neonates, those born during severe weather, those born from a dam with dystocia, and those delivered by cesarean section all are candidates for colostrum supplementation. Supplemental colostrum should be good-quality colostrum from females that have tested negative for Johne\u2019s disease, ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP), and caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE). Mixing colostrum from several cows decreases the incidence of the \u201ccow colostrum\u2013associated\u201d hemolytic disease sometimes seen in lambs. If the lamb or kid is unable to nurse, it should be tube fed 50 mL/kg of colostrum. The veterinarian or animal handler can sit comfortably holding the lamb or kid in sternal recumbency in the lap. A 12 to 14 French soft feeding tube is then lubricated, inserted into the side of the mouth, and passed slowly to the depth of the thoracic inlet. If the tube is placed in the trachea, the lamb or kid will show signs of discomfort and may shake and cough. The tube may be palpated on the left side of the throat. After correct placement of the tube, colostrum can be administered by gravity flow.",

Good sanitation in lambing and kidding areas is paramount in management programs that stress prevention. The presence of organic matter interferes with the effectiveness of many disinfectants, so removal and proper disposal of feces, carcasses, and placentas are essential. When disposing of waste material containing either Cryptosporidium or Giardia, the keeper should be careful to avoid contaminating water sources. Infected animals should be isolated to prevent spread of the infection throughout the flock or herd. In general, infected animals should remain in the environment where the infection was first diagnosed, because it is already contaminated. Removing pregnant ewes or dams to a clean area before lambing or kidding helps minimize the continued spread of disease. If possible, lambs and kids already born but not showing clinical signs should be removed to a third area. If \u201csafe\u201d pastures are maintained for internal nematode control, they are ideal for use in an emergency situation to control these diseases (see also Chapter 6). Although some animals may appear normal, they may be incubating and possibly shedding the infective agents of disease. If such animals are moved with pregnant females, they can be a source of contamination in a clean area. If healthy lambs and kids cannot be moved to a third, relatively safe area, they should be left with the clinically infected animals because they have already been exposed.",

Feces of noninfected sheep and goats within heavily infected herds can yield a positive culture from oral-fecal pass-through of the organism. Sheep strains of Johne\u2019s disease and some goat variant strains seem to be more difficult to culture in media used to identify cattle strains of the disease. Therefore, fecal culture in sheep and goats appears to be of limited benefit in a clinical setting.5\n,\n6 A relatively inexpensive and easily performed method of identifying approximately 50% of all clinically infected animals is acid-fast staining of fecal smears.4\n,\n5 A PCR fecal assay also is available, but its sensitivity is lower than that of fecal culture. Good diagnostic results can be obtained with serologic testing for antibodies (e.g., agar gel immunodiffusion [AGID] test, enzyme-linked immunospecific assay [ELISA], complement fixation test) in animals showing clinical signs. The specificity of all of the serologic tests is greater than 95% in sheep and goats with signs of clinical disease, although the sensitivity is not as high.5., 6., 7., 8. Therefore, a positive serologic test result in an animal showing clinical signs indicates that the animal has Johne\u2019s disease. However, the disease cannot be ruled out with a negative test result. Identification of subclinically infected animals using serologic tests is more problematic. A sensitivity of approximately 50% is all that should be expected. With the ELISA and complement fixation test, cross-reactivity with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis may occur, thereby limiting the value of such testing in flocks with caseous lymphadenitis infections.5\n,\n9 ELISA performed on milk samples from goats had reduced sensitivity but increased specificity (less cross-reaction) compared with serum ELISA.10 Sheep and goats appear to respond differently with regard to the formation of antibodies. In sheep, antibodies tend to develop in the later stages of the disease, whereas antibodies may be detected much earlier in the goat. Necropsy diagnosis is based on the finding of thickened, corrugated intestines, especially in the area of the ileum. Acid-fast staining of impression smears (taken from the ileum and ileocecal lymph nodes) can help yield a quick diagnosis. The staining of numerous clumps of acid-fast rods is highly suggestive of Johne\u2019s disease.",

A description of the surgical correction of atresia ani is reviewed later, whereas the reader is referred elsewhere for the detailed descriptions of creating a permanent colostomy and end-to-end anastomoses for the treatment of other intestinal atresia conditions.207., 208., 209. Although not necessarily lethal, surgical correction of rectovaginal fistulas (as well as rectourethral and rectovesicular fistulas) should also be advocated, as the condition predisposes to urinary tract infections and can result in dilation of the rectum oral to the fistula, resulting in constipation and abdominal pain. Three basic classifications of intestinal atresia classification are described in animals. Type 1, membrane atresia, is caused by a membranous diaphragm occluding the lumen of the intestine. Type 2, cord atresia, is characterized by a fibrous band or muscular cord-like remnant of the gut connecting the two blind ends of oral and aboral intestinal segments. Type 3, blind end atresia, is caused by an absence of a segment of the intestine with unconnected ends and a corresponding gap in the mesentery. The etiopathogenesis of intestinal atresia conditions is likely multifactorial, including reported heritability in lambs. Affected animals should not be used for breeding purposes, ideally with neutering of the animal concurrently at the time of surgical correction of the atretic condition.207\n",

Surgical correction of atresia ani is best achieved in animals in which a bulge in the perineal skin where the anus should be is appreciable. The procedure is performed using epidural anesthesia with or without light sedation, depending on the tractability of the animal. General anesthesia may be more appropriate in cases where extensive tissue dissection is anticipated. The animal is positioned in sternal recumbency with the perineal area clipped and aseptically prepared. A 1- to 1.5-cm diameter circular incision is made through the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the location of the bulge (or where the anus would normally be located). Blunt dissection is performed cranially to identify the rectal pouch. The pouch is gently retracted caudally with tissue forceps, and the rectum is sutured to the subcutaneous tissue with four to six interrupted sutures. The rectal pouch is incised, and the rectal mucosa sutured to the skin in a simple interrupted pattern or in a simple continuous pattern performed in quadrants. In females with rectovaginal fistulas, these should be located and transected prior to suturing the rectum to the perineal skin.207\n,\n210\n",

Increases in total white blood cell counts, the percentage of neutrophils, and total protein concentration are observed.218., 219., 220., 221. In septic peritonitis, degenerative changes to neutrophils may be appreciable and, on occasion, intracellular bacteria are observed on cytologic examination.215 Aerobic and anaerobic culture of abdominal fluid, including antimicrobial sensitivity testing, is indicated for proper treatment. A Gram- stain may aid identification of bacteria and assist in the choice of antimicrobial therapy before culture results are known (or in the absence of a positive culture). Failure to identify or culture bacteria should not rule out a diagnosis of septic peritonitis. Septic peritonitis usually involves a mixed bacterial population depending on the source of peritoneal contamination. Common bacterial isolates from exudative peritonitis include the Enterobacteriaceae, obligate anaerobic bacteria, and gram-positive organisms.

Type II rectal prolapse is a full thickness prolapse of all or part of the rectal ampulla. Type III rectal prolapse is a continuation of a type II rectal prolapse, with the addition of a variable amount of small colon intussuscepted into the rectum. Type IV rectal prolapse involves the intussusception of the peritoneal rectum and variable length of the small colon through the anus.223 Types I to III palpate as a continuous protrusion from the mucocutaneous junction of the anus, whereas type IV is tube-like in appearance and forms a palpable trench inside the rectum on manual palpation. Rectal prolapse is more common in sheep than in goats and is often associated with short docked tails in lambs.224 Producers should be encouraged to dock tails at the level of the attachment of the caudal tail fold rather than close to the body, as the latter is associated with an increased incidence of rectal prolapse. Other causes of rectal prolapse include excessive straining associated with diarrhea (e.g., coccidiosis, salmonellosis), chronic coughing, and tenesmus associated with dystocia or urolithiasis.225 Over-conditioning (i.e., fat animals), grazing lush pastures or feeding of legumes (e.g., alfalfa, clover), and use of growth implants are also implicated as risk factors for the condition.226 Regardless of the cause, eversion and exposure of the rectal mucosa results in irritation and inflammation, which causes further straining, which results in a vicious cycle of more and more tissue becoming prolapsed. Venous drainage of the prolapsed tissue may become compromised, further contributing to the swelling. Exposed tissue becomes edematous, inflamed, and eventually necrotic.",

The purse-string suture is tightened sufficiently to prevent recurrence of the prolapse while allowing the passage of feces. Removal of the purse-string ideally should be within 1 week of placement to minimize suture-tract infection.

During late gestation, particularly in obese females, the abdominal space is filled with accumulated fat and an ever-expanding uterus. Because of the lack of rumen space, these animals have difficulty consuming enough feedstuffs to satisfy energy requirements. In most management systems, late gestation occurs during the winter months when less pasture is available and poorer quality feedstuffs are offered. Energy requirements for ewes and does carrying twins or triplets are greatly increased during the final 2 months of gestation, because 70 to 80% of fetal growth occurs during this time. Ewes with twins require 180% more energy, and those with triplets need 200 to 250% more dietary energy. Glucose maintenance in ewes pregnant with twins is significantly more prone to disturbance resulting in hypoglycemia than in ewes bearing singletons.235 Pregnancy toxemia also occurs in association with anorexia caused by other diseases (e.g., foot rot, OPP, CAE) or sudden stresses (e.g., feed or weather changes, predator attacks, hauling). A period of anorexia or lack of sufficient energy intake will result in a negative energy balance. Affected animals begin to mobilize body stores of fat and transport them to the liver. In the liver, fat is catabolized to glycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs can be used in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) as an energy source, but not in the direct formation of glucose. Anorexic animals have less ruminal substrate available for production of the glucose precursor, propionic acid. However, oxaloacetate, which is an integral part of the citric acid cycle, is removed from the cycle and converted into glucose. Depletion of oxaloacetate inhibits the normal function of the citric acid cycle, thereby inhibiting the use of FFAs. As the pool of FFAs increases, they are converted to ketone bodies or repackaged into lipoproteins. Because ruminants are not efficient at transporting lipoproteins out of the liver and back to the adipose stores, the lipoproteins overwhelm the liver\u2019s ability to handle fats, leading to a massive buildup, and resulting in a fatty liver. Because less substrate is available for glucose formation, more oxaloacetate is \u201ccannibalized\u201d from the citric acid cycle, further inhibiting the body\u2019s ability to use FFAs. This impairment in turn results in the continued accumulation of ketones. Hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, and, potentially, uremia and death can occur.",

In over-conditioned females, the keeper should be encouraged to restrict institution of weight loss programs to early gestation (if at all) and to avoid abrupt feeding changes, while promoting exercise (e.g., by increasing walking distances from mineral access to shelter). The requirement for energy may be one and a half to two times maintenance for dams with single fetuses and two to three times maintenance for those with multiple fetuses. Prevention of concurrent disease, which may further increase energy demands or cause anorexia (e.g., intestinal parasitism, foot rot), is crucial. The keeper should take care to increase the grain portion of the diet slowly, and ensure the consistent availability of fresh, clean water, as anorexia from rumen upset can lead to pregnancy toxemia. Ewes should be offered 0.5 to 1 kg of a cereal grain (corn, oats, barley, or a combination) every day during the final months of gestation; does can be offered 1/2 to 1 kg of grain.

The use of copper oxide wire particles to treat internal parasitism has been suggested as a cause of copper toxicity in goats. Toxicity results from chronic accumulation in the liver from the ingestion of excess copper in relation to molybdenum or sulfate in the diet. In sheep, a copper-to-molybdenum ratio greater than 10:1 leads to the accumulation of excess copper. The most common sources of excess copper in sheep and goats are trace mineral mixtures and feeds formulated for cattle or horses. Clinical signs often are absent during the chronic accumulation phase. Onset of acute disease is related to the sudden release of copper from the liver in large amounts. Stress usually precipitates this acute phase. Acute release of copper and subsequent high blood copper concentrations cause an acute hemolytic crisis, resulting in anemia, hemoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Existing hepatic disease (such as that caused by liver flukes) may predispose animals to this condition. Some breeds (e.g., Merino sheep) seem to be prone to copper absorption and storage problems, whereas others (e.g., pygmy goats) tend to be more resistant and prone to deficiency (see\nChapter 2).",

Appropriate management consists of supportive therapy for the acute renal failure and anemia and attempts to lower liver copper stores. Fluid therapy for the acute renal failure (see Chapter 3) is of clinical benefit, and a blood transfusion may be needed if the PCV drops precipitously. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1.7 mg/kg IV or 3.4 mg/kg SC on alternate days for three treatments) is the most economical agent for treatment in acute cases. In valuable animals, oral d-penicillamine (26\u201350 mg/kg twice daily or 52 mg/kg once daily for 6 days) increases urinary copper excretion. Trientine is used in human beings but has shown variable results in sheep. Treatment of the remainder of the flock should include the oral administration of ammonium molybdate (50\u2013500 mg/head/day) and sodium thiosulfate (300\u20131000 mg/head/day) for 3 weeks. Stress should be minimized, so keepers and clinicians should delay routine maintenance procedures such as deworming and hoof trimming until after treatment. When applicable, spraying a combination of ammonium molybdate and sodium sulfate onto harvested forages low or deficient in copper to approximate the required therapeutic amount will decrease the stress required in daily oral dosing of chemicals. Allowing free access to grazing of forages high in sulfur (greater than 0.5% sulfur), if available, for all surviving ambulatory animals also may help to minimize death losses in a flock or herd. Overzealous attempts to clear excessive hepatic copper stores may potentially lead to deficiency, excessively stress the animal, and can be costly, thus should be avoided. The offending source of copper should be eliminated. Caution should be taken in such cases to remove ionophores from the diet, because these agents may contribute to copper absorption.250\n",

AP concentrations also are not liver-specific, but increased serum levels of GGT are very specific for liver disease. GGT also increases in some hepatocellular diseases, so testing for normal concentrations is important.249 Unfortunately, levels of all of these enzymes can be normal with liver disease, especially if it is chronic. Hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, low blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hypoalbuminemia are not always evident, as is classically taught.

The procedure can be carried out using sedation and local anesthesia (including the use of a high epidural) or under general anesthesia, with the animal positioned in dorsal recumbency. The surgical site is clipped and aseptically prepared. A fusiform skin incision is made around the umbilicus, with sharp and blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissues to expose the hernial ring at the external rectus sheath. In males, a semilunar skin incision and reflection of the sheath and prepuce may be required, depending on the hernia size. The abdominal cavity is opened just cranial (or caudal) to the hernial ring on the linea alba to allow digital palpation of intra-abdominal structures, including the presence of adhered viscera or infected umbilical remnants. The hernial sac is then carefully excised at the scarred edge of the hernial ring. Enlarged or infected umbilical remnants and adhesions are excised (see later) before closure of the defect in the abdominal wall. Closure of the hernial ring is performed by simple apposition of the incised edges of the external rectus sheath using an absorbable suture in a simple continuous or simple interrupted pattern. If significant tension on the body wall is present, a tension relieving pattern should be used (e.g., a near-far-far-near suture). The subcutaneous tissue is closed in a simple continuous pattern using an absorbable suture, and the skin is closed based on surgeon preference.254\n,\n261 Alternatively, a closed herniorrhaphy technique, whereby the peritoneum is not incised, may be elected in uncomplicated umbilical hernias. Closure of the body wall is as described earlier. However, an open technique has the benefit of inspecting the umbilical remnants. Postoperative management includes tetanus prophylaxis, antibiotics where indicated (as in the case of infected umbilical remnants), exercise restriction for 1 to 2 weeks, and the monitoring for excessive swelling, discharge, surgical site dehiscence, and evidence of systemic illness (i.e., peritonitis, sepsis).",

If the infection extends to and involves the liver, marsupialization of the umbilical vein is needed. Marsupialization of the umbilical vein has been described in the cranial aspect of the midline surgical incision or using a separate incision lateral or cranial to the midline incision.254\n,\n261 The former technique is associated with an increased risk of herniation of the marsupialization site. In the latter approach, the vein is dissected free from surrounding tissue, covered with a finger-tip of a sterile glove (or sutured closed), and exteriorized through a separate right paramedian, circular incision. The vein is sutured to the rectus sheath using multiple interrupted absorbable sutures, under minimal tension. In a similar fashion, a second layer of sutures between the vein and the skin is performed using either delayed absorbable or nonabsorbable suture.254 The abdominal incision is then closed as described earlier. The venous stump end is then reopened and allowed to drain. Daily flushing with dilute antiseptic solution can be performed but should be done carefully without back pressure. The animal should be maintained on antibiotics until cessation of drainage, and healing of the venous stump is complete (typically more than 14 days). Rarely, a second operation may be required to resect the marsupialized umbilical vein.254\n,\n261\n",
