Therefore, serum CRP level has been often used as a laboratory marker of inflammation [18,19]. A few studies indicated that CRP is a predictive factor for disease progression in MERS-CoV- and H1N1- infected patients [20,21]. In this study, we first reported that CRP could also be the predictor for the progression of COVID-19.",

But the sample size in the poor prognosis group is small. Moreover, we were unable to analyze the differences in clinical characteristics of patients in the poor prognosis group due to the small sample size. Fourth, we missed asymptomatic and mild cases managed at home, and hence our cohort might represent the more severe population of COVID-19.
