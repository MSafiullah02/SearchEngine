            "text": "Viruses consist of a central core of nucleic acid which may be RNA or DNA, and single- or double-stranded. This is surrounded by a coat (capsid) of repeating protein subunits (capsomers). In most viruses, the capsomers are arranged symmetrically around the nucleic acid, either as an icosahedron or as a helix. Some viruses also have a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane into which viral glycoproteins are inserted. The structure of some smaller viruses (such as polio), and component proteins of more complex viruses (such as influenza hemagglutinin, HA) has been solved at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. Viruses are classified according to the type of nucleic acid making up the genome, whether the genome is segmented or not, and the presence or absence of an outer envelope. Viral genomes vary in size from very small (such as parvovirus with 5 kb of single-stranded DNA) to large (such as poxviruses with up to 280 kb of double-stranded DNA).",

Enveloped viruses may penetrate the cell by fusion with the cell membrane (mediated by fusogenic viral glycoproteins, e.g. Sendai virus) or by endocytosis after binding to their specific receptor (e.g. influenza). In the latter case, the virus then enters the cytoplasm by fusion with the endosomal membrane following an acidic pH-dependent cleavage of viral glycoproteins. Viruses are then uncoated allowing transcription and translation of viral nucleic acids (single positive-stranded RNA viruses are translated directly). In more complex viruses, some of the viral proteins expressed in the infected cell do not form part of the virion; these nonstructural proteins serve functions such as regulating the transcription of other viral and cellular genes, and shutting down synthesis of host cell proteins. Other viral proteins are structural and are incorporated into new virions. Following viral nucleic acid replication, virus particles are assembled by aggregation of structural proteins around the nucleic acid. Nonenveloped viruses may be released from the cell by lysis, whereas enveloped viruses insert their viral glycoproteins into the host cell membrane and bud from the cell surface.",

NK cell recognition of virus-infected cells differs from the classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of T cells, but is affected by MHC molecule expression; the lower the level of MHC class I expression on the surface of the target cells, the greater their susceptibility to killing by NK cells. This is because specific MHC class I alleles on the surface of target cells can inhibit killing by defined NK cell clones, and thus normal levels of expression of certain autologous MHC class I molecules may protect uninfected host cells from being killed by NK cells.",

These include enhanced binding of NK cells to virus-infected cells; increased susceptibility of infected cells to NK killing due to inhibition of host cell RNA and protein synthesis; altered surface expression of host cell proteins (e.g. reduced surface expression of MHC class I); and the protective effects of IFNs on noninfected cells.

IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 bind to a common receptor on the surface of uninfected cells and produce an \u2018antiviral state\u2019 by stimulating synthesis of cellular proteins which interfere with viral RNA transcription and translation. Type I IFNs are completely nonspecific, and are produced in response to, and against, a wide range of viruses. The importance of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 in host resistance to viruses is clearly illustrated by transgenic mice which lack a functional type I IFN receptor; these animals show greatly increased susceptibility to acute virus infection, leading to death within 3 days of infection associated with very high titers of virus in many organs. The type II interferon IFN\u03b3 is produced by NK cells and by T cells on exposure to specific antigen, and activates monocytes and macrophages, enhancing their ability to process and present antigen. IFNs also activate NK cells and the effector cells responsible for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and give rise to many of the systemic symptoms associated with viral infections, such as fever, malaise and myalgia. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) also has an antiviral effect which may be synergistic with that of IFNs.",

Virus-specific antibodies may bind to viral epitopes on the surface of the virion, or to viral glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the infected cell. In order to neutralize the virion, a specific antibody must bind with high avidity to particular epitopes on viral proteins that interact with cell surface receptors. While antibodies can be raised against individual small linear peptides derived from a viral glycoprotein such as influenza hemagglutinin, these antibodies are frequently non-neutralizing; many or most neutralization epitopes are probably conformational ones. Antibody may also limit the spread of infection by agglutination of virions (reducing the number of infectious units), and by enhancing the phagocytosis of virions by mononuclear phagocytes (opsonization).",

            "text": "Virus-specific CTLs are predominantly CD8+ in phenotype, although approximately 10% of human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are potentially cytotoxic and capable of giving rise to virus-specific CTLs. CTLs recognize viral antigens which have been processed and presented as peptides on the surface of infected cells by the appropriate MHC molecules; class I in the case of CD8+ T cells, class II for CD4+ T cells. Processing and presentation of viral antigen allows viral proteins not otherwise expressed on the cell surface to be exposed to T cells, e.g. influenza nucleoprotein. Hence, an infected cell can be recognized and killed by T cells before the virus can replicate, thereby limiting the spread of the infection. Whilst recognition of viral antigen by T cells requires interaction between the T cell receptor and the MHC\u2013antigen complex, interactions between accessory molecules including LFA-1 and ICAM-1, and LFA-3 and CD2 facilitate effector T cell binding to a virus-infected cell. With a few exceptions such as reovirus, CTLs are not serotype specific, i.e. they do not recognize the same epitopes as virus-specific antibodies. The ability of CTLs to confer protection against viral disease can be demonstrated by adoptive transfer in many experimental virus models; for example, naive mice can be protected against lethal influenza A by prior transfer of an influenza A-specific CTL clone. The T cell response to virus infection includes cytotoxic effector T cells and an expanded population of virus-specific memory T cells. After clearance of an acute virus infection (e.g. influenza, in which viral antigen is completely eradicated), effector T cells rapidly disappear, and the size of the memory T cell population may gradually diminish over time. In contrast, in many persistent virus infections (e.g. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)), virus-specific memory CTL precursors remain at high frequency for many years, and probably play a role in controlling the reactivation of persistent virus and maintaining the normal equilibrium between virus and host.",

CD4+ T cells augment T cell, B cell and NK cell responses to viral proteins through secretion of cytokines including IL-2, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3. Cytokines secreted by subpopulations of virus-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ CTLs contribute to the generation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, an inflammatory reaction characterized by a mononuclear cell infiltrate of activated lymphocytes and macrophages. In some experimental virus infections, DTH responses can confer resistance to infection; in response to local infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) inoculated into the ear pinna in mice, CD4+ T lymphocytes from the draining lymph nodes proliferate in response to HSV antigens, mediate DTH and upon adoptive transfer can mediate protection against HSV in naive mice. However, DTH can sometimes be harmful. Mice which have previously been exposed to noninfectious influenzavirus suffer increased mortality when they are subsequently challenged with live influenzavirus; adoptive transfer experiments have shown that induction of strong DTH (by prior exposure to noninfectious virus) may be responsible for this observed increase in mortality.",

In order to establish a successful persistent infection, a virus should minimize damage of host cells. Certain noncytopathic viruses such as the murine arenavirus LCMV replicate with little apparent disruption of cell function. Other viruses have evolved different strategies that can reduce their lytic potential. These include restricted virus gene expression (in the herpesviruses during their latent nonlytic infection of neuronal or lymphoid cells); the generation of mutant viral strains which do not cause cell lysis (in reovirus after in vitro passage in fibroblast lines); and infections where only a small percentage of cells are infected at any one time (in lactic dehydrogenase virus in mice).",
