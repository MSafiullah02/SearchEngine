Negative pressure isolation room (NPIR) uses a ventilation system to keep the air pressure inside the room at negative value, allowing outside air to enter the room, but not indoor air. The diluting effect in NPIR has been reported to be influenced by the airflow pattern along with the air changing rate. 5 NPIR requires air exchange at least 6 times per hour (hospital room) or 12 times (new or renovated building). 6,7 An examinee in the booth will be asked to sampling procedure while he or she temporarily put off his or her mask, and the procedure could inevitably cause them to cough or sneeze. Therefore, the safety of the next examinee should be particularly ensured because there is a risk that aerosols containing viruses may remain in the booth.",

NPIR doors should be always closed, but in the case of walk-through system, examinees frequently enter and exit, so there is a possibility that proper negative pressure may not be maintained due to the inflow of external air. Even if the air conditioning system is stopped due to a power or mechanical failure, a system such as a backflow prevention damper should be equipped to prevent the spread of infection and cross contamination due to backflow of air.",
