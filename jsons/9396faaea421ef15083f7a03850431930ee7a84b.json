Meanwhile, an increase in virus infection among elderly people also significantly increased risks of infection among other age groups. The risks of infection among younger people were relatively unaffected by that of other age groups. Conclusions: Protecting elderly people from coronavirus infection could not only reduce the risk of infection among themselves but also ameliorate the risks of virus infection among other age groups. Such interventions should be effective and for long term.",

Specifically, we assumed daily new case counts (yj,t) followed a generalized Poisson distribution to account for over-dispersion of case counts (i.e., observed variance is larger than expected variance) [20] . The model also included case counts from previous days (lags) across age groups as predictors to form a dynamic model (see Appendix for details). Therefore, the current risk of infection in each age group was predicted not only by previous case counts in its own group but also by previous counts from other age groups. Where j = 1,\u2026,J represented age groups, t=1,\u2026,T represented days, and k = 1,\u2026,K represented the number of time lags. We reported results from five-lag models but three-lag models were also performed. Results from both models were consistent. The scale parameter \u03be in the generalized Poisson distribution controls the magnitude of dispersion, that is, \u03be = 0 corresponding to a standard Poisson (mean = variance), \u03be < 0 suggesting under-dispersion (mean > variance), and 0 < \u03be < 1 indicating overdispersion (mean < variance). The bj,t could be viewed as a random effect to account for the correlation of daily counts between age groups. The bj,t was assumed a multivariate normal distribution.",

Additionally, an increase of infection in the youngest population during the fifth lag days also increased the risk of infection among elderly people by 64%. More importantly, an increase of virus infection among elderly people was associated with increases in risks of infection among all other age groups, but with longer delays in younger populations. Furthermore, the risk of infection among people aged 40 -59 was affected by both old and young people, but to a less extent. Risks of infection among people aged 20 -39 or 0 -19",

Without this information, it is impossible to examine the route of infections in the community.Our study has several strengths. Firstly, we compared risk interactions across age groups andbetween South Korea and Florida. Data from South Korea were more likely complete which would provide information about underlying epidemic mechanisms. Although different social norms and health care systems might explain some differences in risk patterns between South Korea and Florida, similar patterns in risk interactions between regions allowed us to infer the possible paths of infections. Secondly, we proposed a novel multivariate autoregressive model for time series of counts to examine the risk of virus infection across age groups simultaneously. A flexible generalized Poisson model fitted with Bayesian methods was used to account for overdispersion of count data",
