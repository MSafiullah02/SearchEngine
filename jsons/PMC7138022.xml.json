Across all four regions where the Games were located, in areas representing 51% of Greece's population, salmonellosis accounted for about 50% of the mandatory notifications, tuberculosis 17%, hepatitis B 5%, aseptic meningitis 4%, and bacterial meningitis 3%. Recorded morbidity from infectious diseases was very low (2\u20133%). 14 small clusters (2\u20134 people) and eight large clusters (6\u201338 people) of foodborne or waterborne disease were reported in August, 2004. None of these outbreaks was reported from an Olympic venue, highlighting the tendency for all events in an Olympic City during the Games to be labelled as Olympics-related.4\n",

Additional tests are often requested by event organisers\u2014eg, for the 2012 Games additional tests were done on samples from marinas, hotels, training camps, and ships, as well as on samples from swimming pools, spa pools, water systems, food services, and mobile food vendors.

Because the need for this reassurance emerged in the planning discussions, enhancements to surveillance systems and to the coordination and communication of public health activity were necessary to ensure the need could be met. Surveillance systems are not primarily designed to prove that nothing is happening, so they need to be reviewed and enhanced to fulfil this role effectively.

It is now important to maintain and build on this enhancement. Our key message is that, although the absolute risk of health-protection problems, including infectious diseases, at sporting mass gatherings is low, the need for reassurance of the absence of problems is higher than has previously been considered, and this could challenge conventional public health surveillance systems. Lessons from this experience of the London 2012 Games are being used by those planning for the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.49, 50\n",
