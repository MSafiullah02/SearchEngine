            "text": "Both public administration scholars and practitioners believe that \"good governance\" relies on the involvement of compassionate officials. However, they overlook the fact that \"compassion fatigue\" often occurs when officials face the dual pressure arising from superiors' orders and empathy for service receivers. This would inevitably not only affect their individual behaviors, but also influence the effectiveness of their service. A full-scale investigation of animal protection administrators in Taiwan was conducted so as to analyze compassion fatigue that civil servants would encounter and further establish a relationship between various variables and the hypotheses of this study by combining the studies of public administration and psychology. It should be noted that compassion fatigue may affect animal protection administrators' mental health in spite of little influence on their willingness to work hard. However, both \"mindfulness\" and \"moral disengagement\" are coping strategies which were developed for helping tackle the dilemma of compassion fatigue. Although applying the strategy of mindfulness can generate more positive impacts on individuals and organizations than that of moral disengagement, animal protection administrators tended to adopt the latter. Accordingly, encouraging animal protection administrators to adopt mindfulness instead of moral disengagement as their coping strategy will be a priority of work for the authorities in the future.",

However, they have overlooked the fact that these civil servants experience severe physical and psychological damage because of their excessive compassion in servicing people. The most severe instance occurred in May 2016, when Dr. Ya-Cheng Chian, who worked in an animal shelter in Taiwan, died from suicide using the drugs that served to euthanize animals because of the psychological stress induced by the job requirement (BBC 2017) .",

            "text": "Studies on public administration have mostly focused on helping public servants complete their tasks efficiently and building anticorruption systems. They have neglected the helpless individuals experiencing compassion fatigue because of how dedicated they are to their jobs in massive organizations. This situation may be caused by a certain factor. As Waldo (1980) questioned, \"Why would an instrument designed to be impersonal and calculating be expected to be effective in delivering sympathy or compassion?\" Fortunately, studies on psychological counseling have focused on the psychological symptoms from overworking due to high levels of compassion. These symptoms include the feelings of helplessness, anxiety, fear, guilt, anger, numbness, and disengagement. Moreover, the professional term \"compassion fatigue\" was introduced (Figley and Roop 2006) , and effective collective and individual adaptation strategies have been proposed in the psychology field to combat compassion fatigue. Research has suggested that if managers collectively can reduce employees' work burden (Keidel 2002; Yoder 2010) and increase organizational (McArthur https://sites.google.com/site/nutnwuchuanghsien/ge-ren-jian-li-yuzhuan-zhang Wu, C.-H. (2019, October 20) . compassion fatigue related data. Retrieved from osf.io/n28ef et al. 2017: 9) and social support (Dickinson et al. 2010: 153) , employees' psychological health and organizational behavior can remain unaffected by compassion fatigue. Individually, if employees can strengthen their own psychological health (Lally 2005) , increase their compassion satisfaction (Figley and Roop 2006) , and apply mindfulness (Josefsson et al. 2011 ) and emotional separation (Corcoran 1983) , they can alleviate psychological health deterioration and reduce negative organizational behavior.",

These have essentially been considered strategies for alleviating negative effects (deteriorating psychological health and organizational behavior). However, we proposed that the effects of mindfulness and emotional separation can vastly differ in administrative organizations. When administrative ethics is applied against the emotional separation strategy, emotional separation becomes highly similar to the \"moral disengagement\" worried about in administrative ethics. Empirical research has verified that moral disengagement can undermine the personal mental health of civil servants and cause negative organizational behavior. The two mental strategies of mindfulness and moral disengagement appear to have different internal logics; however, studies have not examined and compared these psychological strategies.",

            "text": "Few studies on public administration have focused on the effect of compassion on civil servants' organizational behaviors. With the prevalence of the New Right, most scholars have considered civil servants' behaviors as motivated by rational self-interests. Currently, compassion is not considered the core of public services, and it has not yet been regarded as the cause of negative organizational behaviors. Therefore, the aforementioned case of Dr. Chian's suicide was severely neglected. Psychological studies on compassion fatigue are mandatory to alleviate the compassion fatigue experienced by civil servants. Joinson (1992) coined the term \"compassion fatigue\" to refer to the persistent negative emotions, such as anger and feeling of helplessness, experienced by nursing personnel caring for patients. This concept was subsequently expanded to other counseling professions (Harris 2002) , such as pastors, counselors, and social workers (Hooper et al. 2010) . Coetzee and Klopper (2010) argued that compassion fatigue is a unique type of fatigue caused by the stress accumulated by some service providers because of their strong psychological association with their patients. The term \"fatigue\" was replaced by \"compassion fatigue\" to better describe the negative emotions experienced by nursing personnel directly linked to their compassion (Neville and Cole 2013) .",

The physical and psychological symptoms caused by compassion fatigue are similar to those of posttraumatic stress disorder (Jacobsona et al. 2013) . People experiencing it tend to feel physical discomfort upon repeatedly, involuntarily remembering major traumatic events even though they try to avoid remembering them (Figley and Roop 2006; Figley 2002a) . This causes severe physical problems, including anxiety and depression (Cocker and Joss 2016) . Moreover, as a form of damage to the willingness to work, compassion fatigue causes care providers to dissociate with their own emotions to protect themselves. Consequently, care providers become indifferent and disengaged from compassion and tolerance to patients' pain (Figley 2002a; Figley 2002b) , and they become less willing to work.",

However, this strategy can lead to moral disengagement when applied by civil servants, who possess administrative discretion. To distance themselves from moral stress, civil servants may morally justify their irresponsibility as being a coping strategy.

            "text": "As seen in Table 4 , compassion fatigue significantly affected whether employees favored mindfulness (p < 0.05) or moral disengagement (p < 0.001). The Beta values for the selection of mindfulness and moral disengagement were negative (\u2212.108) and positive (.227), respectively, indicating that employees experiencing compassion fatigue are more prone to opt for moral disengagement than are those not experiencing compassion fatigue. At the same time, employees experiencing compassion fatigue are less willing to opt for mindfulness. Therefore, Hypotheses 7 and 8 were supported. However, the implications of the adjusted R 2 values in Table 4 merit mentioning because they explain the extent to which the predictors influenced the response variable considering that they were very low (.009 and .049). This indicated other predictors not covered in this paper. According to previous empirical research, factors of each of the three dimensions-the individual, organizational, and social-can determine whether an individual adopts mindfulness or moral disengagement as a coping strategy. For example, individuals who adopt mindfulness tend to be older (Mahlo and Windsor 2020) and needs to be exposed to specific organizational conditions, such as high leadership, relative priority, strong networks and effective communications, formally appointed implementation leaders, and knowledge and beliefs about intervention and execution (Hudson et al. 2020) ; they are also influenced by social cognition (Beattie et al. 2020) . By comparison, as for whether an individual adopts moral disengagement as a strategy, personality (e.g., extraversion) was noted to be influential (Mazzone and Camodeca 2019) in addition to the threat of job insecurity (Probst et al. 2020) and social worldviewsuch as social cynicism or fate control (Alexandra 2019). We have not included these factors in our study, but their predictability is potentially higher than that of compassion fatigue factors.",
