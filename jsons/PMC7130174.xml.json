I was in the red zone of an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone, by the patient's bedside with a vomit bowl in my hand. It was the second projectile vomit that hit me, covering me from eye level on my visor down the whole of my right side and onto my wellington boots. A wave of resignation washed over me. I would have to leave the patient and spend the next 15 min decontaminating rather than finishing my review of the other sick patients. There was also the risk that I would contract Ebola. I had thought that I would be frightened the first time I went into the red zone to treat infected patients. But in December 2014, after spending 2 months training other military and civilian doctors and nurses to treat patients with the highly infectious filovirus, I was confident that my protective suit, double gloves, visor, and face mask would be enough to keep me safe, although the exact level of risk was difficult to quantify. On first going into the red zone where the risk of infection is considered to be highest, the main thing I felt was frustration that it was too hot to spend much time with the patients.",

We were in Sierra Leone to staff a specialist treatment unit providing limited critical care to health-care workers who were suspected or confirmed as having been infected with Ebola. For months, West African health-care workers had been getting infected with Ebola at a disproportionate rate, with up to 200 dying.1 In response, the UK Department for International Development funded an intervention programme, with the British Army building multiple Ebola treatment centres to be run by the Save the Children charity using volunteer staff from UK and European health services. The military medical services played a specialized and crucial part. Our job was to look after health-care workers from Africa and international responders if they developed symptoms of Ebola or other serious infections.2 The US and French military ran similar units in Liberia and Guinea.",

Affected patients suffer from severe, copious diarrhoea and vomiting, with infectious virus particles in all body fluids. A significant minority of patients suffer gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Most patients are coagulopathic, oozing from venepuncture or vascular access sites. Early in the disease, patients have very high levels of virus in their blood, sweat, and urine. Patients often develop delirium, probably because of encephalitis, and are restless, pulling at lines and tubes or even attempting to wander off. There is a major risk of cross-infection, which means that patients suspected of having Ebola must be kept apart to reduce the risk of those whose symptoms are a result of malaria or gastroenteritis becoming infected in the process of being screened.3\n4\n",

Some treatment centres gave i.v. fluids to only a very small proportion of patients because of a policy of reducing the risk from needle sticks by not cannulating patients, instead relying only on oral rehydration solution, although this may have changed as more staff became available.6 This strategy is problematic in patients who are profoundly dehydrated, hypokalaemic, and often unable to take any oral fluids for many days because of severe nausea and vomiting.7 There were suggestions that it should be possible to provide much better treatment,8 and most of the European, National Health Service (NHS), and military clinicians I helped to train felt that not to carry out basic laboratory tests and provide i.v. fluid and electrolyte replacement was unacceptable. Certainly, this would be almost inconceivable in any developed country for any other medical condition.",

Would intensive care treatment offer any benefit to patients with Ebola infection? At the time of a UK national policy meeting in late 2014, many felt that interventions such as mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy would pose a risk to staff without making any difference to the patient's eventual death. There were a few dissenting opinions, including those expressed by staff at the Royal Free Hospital. Not long after the UK meeting, a report was published of successful ventilation and dialysis of a patient in the USA, suggesting that the policy of not offering advanced treatment in the UK was unnecessarily nihilistic.11\n",

It was clear that although in our tented facility in the jungle south of Freetown we were able to provide a higher level of care than that available elsewhere in Sierra Leone, we did not have the equipment for respiratory or renal support.12 One of the factors in whether health-care workers volunteer is probably how they think they will be treated if they develop an infection that has a 70% patient fatality rate in Africa but a 95% survival rate in Europe or the USA. One could argue on ethical grounds that volunteers who were encouraged to travel to West Africa by the NHS to assist in the epidemic should be supported to the full extent possible by the UK, including evacuation for care in a specialist unit. By the end of the outbreak, two UK civilian nurses and one military nurse had contracted Ebola infection in the course of their work. Other staff had significant needle stick injuries or close contact with infected colleagues and were evacuated on a precautionary basis to the Infectious Diseases Department at the Royal Free Hospital in London.",

The Royal Free Hospital High Level Isolation Unit has a long pedigree of using Trexler isolators and recent practical experience with viral haemorrhagic fevers.14 The Trexler system contains the infectious patient within a negative pressure compartment in a specially adapted ward. The system allows delivery from another hospital or from overseas of the infected patient in a mobile isolator, which docks with the ward Trexler. Air locks allow delivery of medications and fluids without staff needing to wear elaborate personal protective equipment. Clinical waste can be removed by the same system. Access to the patient is through the Trexler's plastic membrane via integral faceplates and sleeves. Staff training is critical to the successful use of the Trexler system, and complex interventions, such as intubation or central venous access, are regularly practised in simulation scenarios before being carried out for real. Other well-run, professional infectious disease units in Europe and the USA have also shown that it is possible to provide critical care interventions for patients with Ebola, including mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Thanks to these specialized units taking an interventionist approach, most patients treated in the developed world have survived.",
