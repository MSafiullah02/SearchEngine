Using COVID-19 data from different countries, we show that predictions are extremely sensitive to the reporting protocol and crucially depend on the last available data point before the maximum number of daily infections is reached. We propose a physical explanation for this sensitivity, using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model, where the parameters are stochastically perturbed to simulate the difficulty in detecting patients, different confinement measures taken by different countries, as well as changes in the virus characteristics. Our results suggest that there are physical and statistical reasons to assign low confidence to statistical and dynamical fits, despite their apparently good statistical scores. These considerations are general and can be applied to other epidemics.",

Modeling and extrapolating in near real-time the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics is a scientific challenge, which requires a deep understanding of the non-linearities undermining the dynamics of the epidemics. Here, we show that real-time predictions of COVID-19 infections are extremely sensitive to errors in data collection and crucially depend on the last available data point. We test these ideas in both statistical (logistic) and dynamical (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) models that are currently used to forecast the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. Our goal is to show how uncertainties arising from both poor data quality and inadequate estimations of model parameters (incubation, infection, and recovery rates) propagate to long-term extrapolations of infection counts. We provide guidelines for reporting those uncertainties to the scientific community and the general public.",

Moreover, in a recent interview, 7 Italian biologist Bucci stated that D(t) can be underestimated because this does not include those patients who died at home without being tested. On the other hand, in Germany, the fatality rate is extremely low f 0.002. Some query data methodology [e.g., a different method to determine D(t)], while others say high testing rates are giving a more accurate picture, 8 although these hypotheses remain at the level of speculation. Much uncertainty also exist in the count of I(t). While in the early stage of the epidemic, several countries tested asymptomatic individuals to track back the infection chain, recent policies to estimate I(t) have changed. Most of the western countries now test only patients displaying severe SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. In an effort to track all the chains of infections, South Korea has tested many asymptomatic people. This latter strategy has proven effective in supporting actions to reduce the rate of new infections. A recent study 9 has estimated that an enormous number of total infections were undocumented (80% to 90%) and that those undetected infections were the source for 79% of documented cases in China.",

            "text": "The goal of this paper is to analyze the effect of those large uncertainties in real-time forecasting of the long-term behavior of the COVID-19 epidemic. 10 As stated by Polonsky et al., 11 there is a need for defining robust methods to assess both the intrinsic errors inherent to fitting procedures as well as those introduced by poor data quality. Funk et al. 12 give a concrete example of this applied to the Ebola epidemics in the Western Area region of Sierra Leone in 2014-2015. Classically, epidemiologists rely on Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models. 13 These models consist of ordinary differential equations where a population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. In SEIR, the population is divided into susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals. Such models predict a sigmoid shape of the total number of infections C(t) = \u03b3 t \u03c4 =1 I(\u03c4 ). Using the available national data points I(t), one can obtain long-term estimates on the total of COVID-19 infections in each country. This paper focuses on the estimation of the sensitivity of these models to the last available data point before the inflection point of the I(t) curve is reached. We use SEIR models to show the possible origins of this sensitivity by perturbing the relevant parameters, often assumed deterministic, with a noise that mimics changes in the way the virus is spreading, e.g., as a result of application of confinement measures or the presence (rate/magnitude) of super-spreaders. 14 The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, we discuss the various sources of data for COVID-19 and their shortcomings, and then we discuss in detail the SEIR model and its statistical modeling. In Sec. III, we discuss the results focusing on the statistical sensitivity of the modeling and apply them to the data from France, UK, and Italy. We finish, in Sec. V, with some remarks and point out some potentially beneficial policy guidelines.",

The data repository 15 is also supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). We used datasets of cases confirmed with a laboratory test, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. 3 The data contain, as recognized by the public authorities that dispatched them, several inhomogeneities due to the different ways of testing patients with suspicious symptoms. As an example, Italy announced on February 26 that it relaxed testing criteria to the point that contacts linked to confirmed cases or recent travelers to outbreak areas would not be tested anymore, unless they show symptoms. 16 Unlike Italy, South Korea (with a population of 51 million) has been testing 15 000-20 000 individuals per day since February 27 with the goal to minimize hospital pressure and stop the epidemic in the early stages. 17 COVID-19 data also suffer from reporting problems due to the local management of health infrastructures. In Italy, healthcare is a regional task and every day data are collected at a regional level and transmitted to the Chaos ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/cha Protezione Civile, who transfers the data to WHO. Many inconsistencies and delays have been documented in this transfer process. 18 A similar situation occurs in Mexico, in which, for instance, private institutions, either hospitals or laboratories, do not possess the necessary national and international certifications given by the Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos (InDRE) and, therefore, their tests are not considered valid and must be redone by certified institutions, 19 thus unnecessarily delaying of the release of accurate daily reports. COVID-19 data of Mexico were collected from the daily reports generated by Mexico's Secretar\u00eda de Salud. 20 Our goal is to account for these uncertainties in the modeling of COVID-19 data.",

The best-fit yields a root mean square error of \u223c2500, which represents about the 20% of the peak value of I(t) in the Chinese data. First of all, we note that, despite its simplicity, the model shows qualitatively similar behavior to the published data. Note that there is a discontinuity in the dataset, which is due to a change in the way infections were counted, introduced on February 12, 2020. 25 This model also has evident deficiencies in representing the COVID-19 infections. First of all, the total population N, which provides the best fit for the Chinese data, is orders of magnitude lower than that of China or the Hubei province. Indeed, a major problem in the estimation of the SEIR model for COVID-19 is almost the total absence of infection counts for asymptomatic patients. In Ref. 26, posterior model estimates of percentage of total population infected (prevalence), as of March 28, 2020, have been performed for European countries that yield a ratio between C(t) and total population of the same order of magnitude of the Chinese Hubei province. That study revealed a COVID-19 prevalence of 15% (CrI [3.7%-41%]) for Spain and 9.8% (CrI [3.2%-26%]) for Italy. Furthermore, the population under consideration does not consist of a group of about the same age and general health level, and the group members do not mix homogeneously. The model does not have any spatial component, nor does it predict the influences of policy and behavioral responses to the progress of the pandemic. Finally, the fit is obtained with a constant value of R 0 , although confinement measures have been introduced, possibly leading to a reduction in \u03bb 0 and, therefore, in R 0 . More complex models introducing further parameters would likely lead to overfitting and overconfident predictions due to the limited volume of data currently available. No model will be sufficient to predict the outcome of this pandemic: the outcome depends on our response.

At first sight, one can be tempted to use R 2 0.997 as a quality indicator of the fit. However, we stress that R 2 is not an appropriate measure for nonlinear regression models: given the smoothness of data, there will be lots of models (e.g., low-order polynomial), which could fit well (get a very good R 2 ) but would not make credible predictions. 33 These data are, however, collected at a mature stage of the epidemic and as such the characteristics of the logistic fit to these data can be assigned with greater confidence. In Sec. III, we will discuss the performance of the statistical model in the early stage of the epidemics, where the logistic function can be used to extrapolate the behavior of C(t).",

France has previously recorded sporadic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, but the exponential growth phase started at the beginning of March 2020. To show the high sensitivity to the last point of the datasets, we first perform a logistic fit with data starting from different dates and ending on March 20 [ Fig. 3(a) ] and then do the reverse experiment by fitting data starting on March 4 but ending at different dates [ Fig. 3(b) ]. This procedure is known as leave-one-out cross-validation, which has already been used in epidemiological models, 34 although other studies have suggested that cross-validation is biased toward more complex models. 35 Our goal is to use cross-validation not as a way to perform model selection but rather to assess the uncertainty in the estimation of the logistic fit to COVID-19 data. The results show that fits are more stable by removing days from the beginning of the outbreak than from the most recent past, therefore showing a time-asymmetry in the cross-validation procedure. Again, we stress the inadequacy of the R 2 metric as it yields values above R 2 > 0.99 for all cases considered in Fig. 3 . The analysis suggests that, if a large error is presented in the last data point, the extrapolation has less predictive adequacy. This implies very narrow estimates of confidence intervals for C(t): for each fit, confidence intervals are as small as the thickness of the line used in the plots in Fig. 3 . This prevents a correct evaluation of the confidence interval, which is critical to assess the uncertainties around the future evolution of the epidemics and to build relevant policies to address the worst case scenario.",

To date, Italy is at a Chaos ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/cha more mature stage of the epidemic, while France and UK face an earlier stage. This is reflected in the spread of the ensemble: for the UK, forecasting the epidemic with a logistic fit is not informative of the course of the epidemic: the ensemble spread just suggests that the current phase is an exponential growth and at best it can inform that worst case scenarios should be considered at this point.

[37] [38] [39] In the modeling of COVID-19 infections, the stochastic approach can be further justified by the evidence that R 0 = \u03bb/\u03b3 displays spatial and temporal variability. 11 For example, Wu et al. 21 show fluctuations of R 0 in different Chinese regions. These differences are due to changes in the duration of contagiousness, likelihood of infection per contact and the contact rate, 40 which depends on demographic spatial variability. 41 There is, however, little consensus on which variables or parameters should be perturbed in order to get a realistic behavior. Our goal here is different than obtaining the best possible forecasts of the epidemics as we want to understand which parameter causes a large sensitivity in the final C(t) counts. Let us begin, by alternatively replacing in Eqs. (7)-(10) one of the constant parameters \u03ba \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03bb, \u03b3 } with a stochastic process",

The sensitivity of the model is higher when I(t) is large because \u03b3 and \u03bb directly act on I(t). Therefore, when approaching the maximum of I(t) (t \u223c 50 days), small changes in the parameters can greatly affect the final total count of infections C(t). This implies that mitigation strategies based on the reduction of \u03bb by self-isolation, social distancing, are way more effective if imposed at the early stage of the epidemics because they allow to suppress the fluctuations in R 0 that can lead to spikes of I(t) and trigger a cascade infection process.",

It is robust, for instance, that there is an exponential regime and that the outcome of the epidemics is very sensitive to variations in the parameters during the exponential phase. In order to use dynamical models, one should first perform a grid search for the deterministic SEIR model and obtain the best set of parameters. From the root mean square errors, one can infer the typical distance from model to data and use that value to set the level of noise in the parameters. Then, by running a stochastic SEIR model, an uncertainty range for the prediction can be obtained.

First of all, we noted that SEIR model, with \u03bb, \u03b3 , and \u03b1 inferred from clinical studies, can fit Chinese data with a value of N 88 000 that is very different from that of the Chinese, Hubei, or Wuhan populations. This enormous discrepancy can be due both to a large underestimation in the prevalence or to the effectiveness of confinement measures which results in a smaller exposed population. This estimate should be taken as a first caveat in fitting a SEIR model to infer COVID-19 epidemics evolution in other countries as results may be largely under/overestimated. 11 Then, we have shown that statistical fits often used to extrapolate the long-term behavior of the epidemics are greatly affected by the magnitude of the last data point, despite values of R 2 close to one, leading to unrealistic or overconfident estimates of confidence intervals on the forecast of the total number of infections. 45, 46 In the early stage of the epidemics, we have shown that knowing the last data point with a relative 20% error can lead to a final extrapolation of infections with an error of several orders of magnitude. In order to improve the estimates of statistical models, one should replace R 2 estimates by a formal comparison of model-alternatives using information criteria (e.g., AIC or BIC) or a log-likelihood approach with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure.",

(12) ]. We have found that the stochastic dynamics are more sensitive to \u03b3 and \u03bb. Perturbations on these parameters are proportional to the number of infected patients I(t) and are, therefore, important in the growth phase of the epidemics. Actual data display fluctuations even larger than those simulated in the stochastic models, suggesting that instead of assuming observational Gaussian noise on the parameters, jump processes (e.g., Levy noise) may be more appropriate. 47 Furthermore, we noticed that large fluctuations in the number of detected infections are also due to changes in the testing protocols and availability of tests. All these inconsistencies prevent the possibility of performing meaningful asymptotic statistical or dynamical modeling for COVID-19 or comparing results among different countries. This may be even more problematic in less developed countries, which are just beginning to register cases. [48] [49] [50] Our study suggests that dynamical and statistical modeling should focus on limited stages of the epidemics and restrict the analysis to specific regions, thus accounting for large uncertainties, as done in Ref. 51 . Modeling approaches should take into account both statistical uncertainties as well as expert knowledge in a sort of Bayesian framework that allows to guide the choice of prior probabilities. 10 In the interest of preserving the public health of as many individuals as possible, once modeled the uncertainty in the data, the worst case scenarios should always be taken into account very seriously as a guideline to enforce strict confinement measures.

(12) and using \u03c3 = 0.2\u03ba 0 to get fluctuations of the order of 20% of each parameter values, in analogy with the statistical sensitivity studies performed Sec. III A. The sensitivity clearly depends on the perturbed parameter: a perturbation on \u03b1 mostly implies a different timing of the epidemics while the final cumulative number of infections C(t) remains unchanged. Perturbations on \u03bb and \u03b3 affect the final C(t) in a deeper way, leading to a total variation in the number of cases of the order of 20%. Indeed, by changing \u03bb and \u03b3 , we also modify the basic reproduction number R 0 . The idea of having Chaos ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/cha FIG. 5.
