Some of these proteins are simply anchored to membrane via transmembrane helices.

As implied by their name, the viroporin proteins can form channel-like structures in lipid bilayer that permeate ions or solutes. Now over a dozen viroporins from various sources have been characterized, covering a wide range of ion substrates including H + , K + , Na + , Ca 2+ , and Cl \u2212 , as well as larger substrates such as RNA. The exact function of ion channel activity in many viruses is not yet known, though their roles have been implicated in entry, virus assembly and virus release. The function of membrane fusion proteins is much better defined, that is, to enable viral entry by mediating virus-host membrane fusion. The viral fusion proteins have large extramembrane domains for receptor recognition and for grabbing onto the host cell membrane, but the function of their TM and membrane-proximal regions have been elusive. Functional mutagenesis studies have suggested that, at least in the cases of HIV-1 and influenza A viruses, the TM domains (TMDs) of fusion proteins are not merely membrane anchors, but play important roles in membrane fusion and viral infectivity. Apart from the channels and fusion proteins, some viruses have developed enzymatic domains anchored to the membrane, e.g., the polymerases of the hepatitis C virus and the neurominidase of the influenza viruses. In these cases, the TMDs are believed to only serve as membrane anchors and thus will not be discussed in this chapter.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 583, "end": 585, "text": "2+", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Viroporins serve highly diverse functions in viral infection cycles (illustrated in Fig. 6.1 ). Early studies of viroporins have focused on only a few systems including 2B of poliovirus, 6K of togavirus, and M2 from influenza A virus (AM2). The 2B is a well-known viroporin that can modify membrane permeability and allow the passage of ions and small molecules during later stages of viral infection [1] [2] [3] . The 6K is a small, hydrophobic acylated protein that has been shown to form cation-selective channels when inserted into lipid bilayers [4] . The 6K is proposed to be involved in virus budding, but the exact role of 6K in the viral life cycle is poorly characterized [5] [6] [7] . The AM2 proton channel is the most studied viroporins because (1) it is the drug target of the first anti-flu drug (amantadine or rimantadine) and (2) it is one of the smallest proton channels with proton selectivity motif not found in any of the proton channels from other organisms [8] [9] [10] . Since the definition of viroporin has been put forward, more and more viroporins have been classified (Table 6 .1). The influenza B virus encodes the BM2 proton channel that is a functional homolog of the AM2 but cannot be blocked by the adamantane family of drugs [11] . The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 have been shown to form oligomeric channels to conduct cations [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The 2B protein from the enterovirus 71 (EV71), however, displayed altered channel activity, as it conducts anions (e.g., Cl \u2212 ) instead of cations [17] . Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1) has a viral K + channel named Kcv that contains the canonical potassium selectivity filter [18] and was proposed to adopt similar structure as KcsA [19] . In addition to the ion channels, the VP4 from rhinovirus can form pores that (1) . Virion attaches directly host cell receptors on the membrane (2) . and subsequently enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis (3) . Acidification of the endosomal vesicles triggers conformational changes in the virion, resulting in fusion between the viral and the endosomal membranes, allowing the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. The viral RNA is then released into the cytoplasm and presented to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4) . At the ER, viral RNA is translated into protein that is processed by viral and host proteases (5) . After the viral replication complex is synthesized, RNA synthesis begins by the transcription of an antisense viral RNA followed by the amplification of viral RNA (6) . The newly synthesized RNA is subsequently packaged by capsid protein, forming a nucleocapsid (7) . Virus assembly occurs on the surface of the ER when the nucleocapsid buds into the ER lumen, then transported through the Golgi, where acidification induces virus maturation (8) . Mature viral particles are released in the neutral pH of the extracellular millieu (A) viral entry, which acidifies the virion interior immediately after endocytosis and facilitates RNA release (B) Dissipation of the proton gradient in the Golgi and the trans-Golgi network. The viroporins influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein 2 (M2) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 equilibrate the proton concentration with the cytosol to reduce the acidification of vesicular acidic compartments (C) viroporins play an essential role in assembly, budding and release of the viral particles (D) Alteration of cellular Ca 2+ homeostasis. Calcium uptake by the mitochondria can lead to dissipation of the inner-mitochondrial-membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and, finally, the release of cytochrome c. In the cytosol, cytochrome c promotes the subsequent formation of apoptosome that is involved in apoptosis allow single-stranded viral RNA to cross the membrane [20, 21] , further expanding the list of substrates that viroporins transport.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 409, "end": 412, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 551, "end": 554, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 686, "end": 689, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 690, "end": 693, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 758, "end": 761, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 843, "end": 846, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 980, "end": 983, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 984, "end": 987, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 988, "end": 992, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1421, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1426, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1431, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1436, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1441, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1595, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1740, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1797, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1880, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1947, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2016, "end": 2019, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2335, "end": 2338, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2435, "end": 2438, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2607, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2703, "end": 2706, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2883, "end": 2886, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3880, "end": 3884, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3885, "end": 3888, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 84, "end": 92, "text": "Fig. 6.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1105, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Function of Viroporins"}, {"text": "Probably the best-defined roles of viroporins are that of the M2 proton channels of influenza A and B viruses, both of which involve equilibrating pH between compartments. One important role of the M2 is to equilibrate pH across the viral membrane during viral entry, which acidifies the virion interior immediately after endocytosis and facilitates RNA release [22, 23] (Fig. 6.1a ). Another role of M2 is to equilibrate pH across the trans-Golgi membrane of the infected cells during viral maturation, which preserves the pre-fusion form of the hemagglutinin fusion protein through de-acidification of the Golgi lumen [24] (Fig. 6.1b) . The roles of other cation-selective viroporins are less clear. One of the general roles proposed for viroporin is to depolarize either the ER or plasma membrane to facilitate membrane curvature formation during virus budding [25, 26] (Fig. 6.1c ). In the case of HCV, for example, the p7-mediated channel activity has been reported to facilitate virus release [27, 28] . Another general role for viroporin is simply to cause cation leakage, which would induce cellular stress and programmed cell death [29] (Fig. 6.1d ). In addition to ion permeation, several viroporins are known to participate in viral assembly through interaction with other proteins. For example, the influenza AM2 and BM2 proteins both have significant cytoplasmic domains that are believed to recruit matrix proteins M1 during virus assembly [30] [31] [32] . The HCV p7 protein has also been reported to interact with other non-structural proteins such as NS2, and this interaction appears to be crucial for the production of infectious HCV particles [33, 34] .

Depending on the type of the virus, fusion can occur either with the host plasma membrane or with the endosomal membrane. The membrane fusion must occur without consuming energy; it is catalyzed by major conformational changes of specialized envelope proteins generally known as viral fusion proteins. Despite their diversity, all known viral fusion proteins convert from a prefusion state (dimers or trimers, depending on the class), through a key intermediate state (extended conformation), to a postfusion state (a trimer of hairpins) that brings the fusion peptide, attached to the target membrane, and the TM domain, attached to the viral membrane, into close proximity thereby facilitating the fusion of viral and target membranes ( Fig. 6 .2a) [35] . Three distinct classes of viral fusion proteins (exemplified in Fig. 6 .2b) have been defined based on structural criteria [36] . The Class I includes fusion proteins from some of the best characterized human pathogens, such as influenza and HIV-1. These proteins are trimers of a single chain precursor that requires a proteolytic cleavage to generate two fragments. For example, the influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) contains the N-terminal fragment HA1 and C-terminal fragment HA2 [37] , and the HIV-1 envelope protein is cleaved into the gp120 and gp41 fragments [38] . The fusogenic fragment gp41 bears a hydrophobic fusion peptide capped by the outer receptor binding fragment gp120 [39] . Receptor binding accompanies cap protein release, allowing major conformational changes in the gp41 that ultimately leads to fusion [40] . In the case of influenza, the cap HA1 is released by low pH of the endosome after endocytosis [41] . The Class II fusion proteins are found on flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and bunyaviruses (E in flaviviruses, E1 in alphaviruses, GN and GC in bunyaviruses) [42, 43] . Although these fusion proteins are architecturally different from the Class I fusion proteins, i.e., Class II fusion proteins are mostly made of \u03b2-sheets as opposed to the helical structures of the Class I fusion proteins, they operate on the same physical principle. Their fusion peptides are formed as loops at the tips of \u03b2-strands that serve as an anchor to insert into the host membrane after endocytosis. Unlike Class I proteins, which remain trimeric, their conformational change involves a change in oligomeric state from pre-fusion dimers to post-fusion trimers [44, 45] . The reduced pH of the endosome induces a cascade of subsequent refolding and trimerization events that achieve membrane fusion [46] . Members of the Class III include G protein of VSV, gB of herpes simplex virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and gp64 of the insect-cell baculovirus [47] . The Class III fusion proteins combine some of the features of Class I and II fusion proteins [48] . Each protomer is composed of five domains that contain a central trimeric coiled-coil, a hallmark of Class I proteins in their postfusion states, three of the domains are predominantly made of \u03b2-sheets and their fusion peptide more closely resemble those of Class II proteins in that their fusion loops are found at the tips of extended \u03b2-strands [49] . Due to the essential roles of viral fusion proteins during infection, they have long been pursued as targets for antiviral intervention. For example, the approved small molecule drug Arbidol is used as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of influenza A and B virus, as well as hepatitis C virus [50, 51] . Unlike many other broad-spectrum antivirals, Arbidol has an established mechanism of action against the HAs in influenza A and B viruses that involves the inhibition of virus-mediated membrane fusion and thus viral entry [50] . In addition, Enfuvirtide (T20, Fuzeon) is an approved peptide drug that blocks the HIV-1 entry [52] ; it is derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat 2 region of the HIV-1 gp41 envelope glycoprotein, designated the C-peptide, that disrupts membrane fusion by competing with an intra-molecular interaction that is important for the refolding of gp41 during membrane fusion [53] . Apart from being therapeutic targets, another important medical use of the fusion proteins is vaccine development. Viral fusion proteins are usually presented on the virion surface with high copy numbers, and thus are popular antigens for eliciting broadspectrum neutralizing antibodies. For example, the native conformations of the The N terminus of HA1 and the C-terminus of the HA2 ectodomain are labeled. Blue arrow: position of fusion peptides inserted near threefold axis in prefusion form. Only HA2 is shown on the bottom. The N-terminus (blue arrow; note that the fusion peptide is not part of the structure shown) and C-terminus of the blue-colored subunit are indicated Class II: dengue virus type 2 E protein (1OAN and 1OK8). the radial (\"top\") view shows just the \"stem-less\" ectodomain (1OAN). Colors: domain I: magenta; domain II: cyan; domain III: yellow; stem: cyan; Colors for domains I, II and III are the same in the postfusion representation. A dashed cyan arrow on the postfusion trimer shows where the stem emerges from domain III. Red asterisks: fusion loops Class III: VSV G ectodomain (2J6J and 2CMZ). The three chains are in gold, sea green, and magenta. Dashed lines show the location of a disordered, C-terminal segment that connects the folded protein to the transmembrane anchor. Only the magenta-subunit C-terminal segment is shown on the bottom. The curved gold arrow indicates that in the transition from the conformation on the top to the conformation on the bottom, the domain bearing the fusion loops flips over by about 180\u00b0 to engage the host-cell membrane.

A robust approach is to force highlevel expression of the hydrophobic peptides, which are toxic to cells, into inclusion bodies. In our experience, the most effective implementation of this approach is to express the peptide as a C-terminal fusion to the trpLE protein (which drives inclusion body formation) in the pMM-LR6 vector [60] [61] [62] (Fig. 6 .3a). The trpLE has an N-terminal 9\u00d7His tag to permit nickel affinity purification. A methionine between the trpLE and the peptide is added for cleavage by cyanogen bromide so that the peptide can be released from the trpLE. Purification of the peptide involves (1) purifying the trpLE-peptide fusion protein from the inclusion bodies by nickel affinity, (2) cleavage by cyanogen bromide of the fusion protein in formic acid, and (3) separation of the peptide from trpLE or fusion protein by reverse-phase HPLC. While the above protocol is quite general for hydrophobic peptides, it requires that the peptides have no methionine in the middle of the peptide sequence.

While nanodiscs are the closest mimic of native membrane, we find that the lipid/detergent bicelle system is a good compromise between having the capacity to provide a near lipid bilayer environment and generating good NMR spectra. Previous studies on the bicelle system with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) as lipid and (1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) as detergent have shown that when the molar ratio of lipid to detergent (q) > 0.5, the assembly reaches the ideal bicelle condition in which the lipid and detergents are well segregated [63, 64] . At q = 0.5, for example, the estimated diameter of the lipid bilayer region of the bicelle disc is ~45 \u00c5 according to the equation describing bicelle assembly [64] [65] [66] , and this size is sufficiently large to accommodate small TMDs.

Probably the biggest challenge is measuring inter-protomer restraints in cases of oligomer complexes. In particular, structure determination of symmetric oligomers faces the challenge of measuring NOE-based 1 H-1 H distances between structurally equivalent protomers having the same NMR peaks, which are needed as inter-protomer restraints. A proven way to solve this problem is using a mixed sample in which half of the protomers are ( 15 N, 2 H)-labeled and the other half 13 C-labelled, for measuring, exclusively, NOEs between the 15 N-attached 1 H of one protomer and 13 C-attached 1 H of the neighboring protomer [60, 69] (example from the TMD of the Fas receptor shown in Fig. 6 .3b). Once the trimer solution is established, conventional 15 N-and 13 C-edited NOE experiments can then be used to collect self-consistent backbone-sidechain and sidechain-sidechain NOE restraints. In addition to structure determination, an important aspect of small TMDs is interaction with membrane. The bicelle system allows accurate determination of the position of TMD in the bilayer region of the bicelles using a solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analysis [63] . In this method, titration of the water-soluble and membrane-inaccessible paramagnetic agent, Gd-DOTA (Gadolinium (III) 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate), is used to generate the solvent PRE. This approach is based on the notion that if the bicelle is sufficiently wide, the lateral solvent PRE becomes negligible, thus allowing the use of measurable solvent PRE to probe residue-specific depth immersion of the protein along the bicelle normal. At each titration point, a 2D 1 H-15 N correlation spectrum is recorded to measure residue-specific PRE. For each of the residues, the PRE titration curve is fitted to exponential decay to derive the residue-specific PRE amplitude (PRE amp ). The PRE amp vs. (residue position) along the trimer symmetry axis (parallel to the bilayer normal) is then analyzed using the sigmoidal fitting method [63] to determine the TMD region that resides at the center of the bilayer as well as the thickness of the bilayer around the protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 751, "end": 755, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 756, "end": 759, "text": "69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1303, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2169, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 811, "end": 817, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Structural Methods for Investigating Viral Membrane Protein"}, {"text": "For studying small molecule drug binding to viral membrane proteins, chemical shift perturbation (CSP) induced by drug titration is a convenient probe for identifying the approximate binding site.

First, many small molecule inhibitors are hydrophobic and preferentially partition into detergent micelles or lipid/detergent bicelles, and thus the CSP can be induced simply by alteration of the micelle/bicelle environment. Second, in addition to CSP caused by close ligand contact, CSP could arise from changes in conformation and/or dynamics. Hence, the more direct NOE data is preferred wherever feasible. The simplest and the most sensitive approach for collecting protein-drug NOE is using proteins that are 15 N-labeled and completely deuterated so that NOE between the protein backbone amide protons and drug protons could be measured unambiguously (Fig. 6.3c ). Once the binding site has been unambiguously spotted, further contacts between the drug and protein sidechains can be measured using conventional 13 C-edited methyl or aromatic NOESY.

The sequences consist of three domains: an extracellular N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and an intracellular C-terminal domain. These domains arrange into different structures. The only homologous sequence between the two proteins is the HxxxW sequence motif of the TMDs that is essential for channel activity. The TM region of the AM2 contains residues 24-46. The unstructured extracellular segment of AM2 is relatively conserved and has been sought after as a vaccine epitope [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] . BM2 has a similar sized TMD (residues 4-33), but a much larger C-terminal cytoplasmic domain [32, 82] . The BM2 cytoplasmic region also assembles into oligomers which are important for recruiting the matrix proteins to the cell surface during the viral assembly [30, 31, 83, 84] . The first high-resolution structures of the AM2 channel were reported concurrently by solution NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography in 2008 [56, 62] . Subsequent X-ray and solution NMR studies also determined structures under different conditions [57] and with different drug resistance mutations [85, 86] . Moreover, structural characterization by solid-state NMR studies generated the channel structures in the lipid bilayer environment [87] [88] [89] . The above AM2 structures solved under different conditions show significantly different conformations ( Fig. 6.4a) , suggesting that the tetrameric assembly of the AM2 is quite dynamic and is sensitive to the reconstitution environment. The structural plasticity observed in AM2 is likely present in many other viral membrane proteins, which could explain why structural study of this type of proteins has been so difficult. Despite the differences, the experimental structures converged to a common mode of channel assembly: a left-handed four-helix bundle forms the channel pore, and that tetramerization of the four TM helices is further stabilized by intermolecular contacts between C-terminal amphipathic helices flanking the TMD [62, 88] . This mode of assembly places the \"H\" and \"W\" of the HxxxW sequence motif inside the channel (Fig. 6.4a) .

Unlike the AM2, the BM2 channel shows strong coiled-coil characteristics with regular heptad repeats [8] . In the BM2 structure, the two heptad repeats show that positions a and d are occupied mostly by hydrophilic residues such as serines and His19; positions g and e are occupied by hydrophobic leucines and phenylalanines, respectively, to allow for peripheral hydrophobic interactions between the leucines and phenylalanines (Fig. 6.4d ). This arrangement for coiled-coil assembly in membrane allows the TM segment to form a stable tetramer by itself and is the opposite to that of water-soluble coiled-coil tetramer, in which positions a and d are typically hydrophobic residues and positions g and e are polar residues [90] . The histidine (His19) and tryptophan (Trp23) of the HxxxW motif are also pore-lining in the inverse coiled-coil assembly in membrane.

Functional mutagenesis [91] and NMR measurements [92] showed that proton transport across the membrane through the AM2 channel involves cycles of histidine protonation and deprotonation, and that the histidines serve as proton shuttling devices. Not all histidines can be protonated at the same time in the narrow channel, as protonation of one histidine would increase the energy barrier for the protonation of another histidine. Indeed, multiple pKa values (8.2, 6.3 and one below 5.0) have been detected in the AM2 [91, 93] . Therefore, our current understanding of the proton conduction mechanism is that the minimally required unit for pH-dependent proton conduction in the AM2 and BM2 is the His-Trp complex.

It was also proposed that protonation of histidines leads to cation-\u03c0 interactions between the histidine and tryptophan [94, 95] .

The channel activity of p7 is important for the assembly and release of infectious viruses, although the molecular mechanism of this function remains unknown [27, 28] . As in the case of AM2, structural characterization of p7 was confronted with challenges of coping with the hydrophobic and dynamic nature of the protein. Earlier NMR studies of p7 under conditions that support the monomeric state of the protein showed that p7 has three TM helical segments: two in the N-terminal half of the sequence and one near the C-terminus [97, Fig. 6 .4b Isolated view of the pore-lining histidine (magenta) and tryptophan (cyan) sidechains in M2 and BM2 channels.

The channel interior of p7 has a number of strongly conserved residues that are likely candidates to serve the above functions. One suspect is Asn9, which forms a ring of carboxamide near the narrow end of the channel (Fig. 6.5b) . Residue 9 is asparagine in all strains except being substituted with histidine in genotype 2 viruses. Formation of a ring of carboxylates or carboxamides has been a recurring theme in prokaryotic and eukaryotic channels that have selectivity for divalent cations. For examples, the CorA Mg 2+ channel has a pentameric ring of asparagines [102] , and the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel Orai has a hexameric ring of aspartic acids [103] . These channels all have strong selectivity for divalent cations, although they can also conduct monovalent cations such as Na + and K + . In addition to the Asn9 ring, residues near the hinge between H1 and H2 (Ser12, Asn16, Trp21) are in an arrangement that may also bind In addition to what appears to be the cation selectivity ring near the narrow, N-terminal exit of the channel, the wider, C-terminal entrance of the channel is decorated with a conserved ring of arginines or lysines (Fig. 6.5b) . Placement of a positively charged ring at the entrance was anticipated because it may repel cations. But an earlier study reported that a designed TM barrel with internal argininehistidine dyads forms efficient cation selective channels [104] because the immobile arginines can recruit mobile anions, which in turn facilitate cations to diffuse through the pore. It is interesting to note that a highly basic region containing Arg155, Lys159 and Lys163 in the pore was also found in the CRAC Orai structure [103] . One possible role of these basic residues in cation selective channels is binding and obstructing anions while allowing cations to diffuse into the pore.

The drug binding site consists of eight methyl groups of the M2 tetramer (two from each subunit: Val27 C \u03b31 H 3 and Ala30 C \u03b2 H 3 ) that form a deep internal hydrophobic pocket surrounding the adamantane cage of the drug (Fig. 6.6a ). The structure also shows that the nitrogen of the rimantadine amino group may form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala30 of one of the four subunits. The terminal methyl group of the rimantadine is in the middle of the pore, facing the open space in the channel around the Gly34 position. The structure also shows that rimantadine binding is slightly tilted: its vertical axis is on average ~20\u00b0 from the C4 symmetry axis of the channel. The tilt angle is consistent with the amantadine tilt in the M2 channel observed with solid-state NMR spectroscopy [87] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 547, "end": 552, "text": "[111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1003, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1819, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1227, "end": 1237, "text": "(Fig. 6.6a", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Drug Binding of Viroporins"}, {"text": "In addition to blocking the AM2 channel, the amantadine and its derivatives have also been shown to pose some inhibitory effects on the p7 channel conductance [15, Fig. 6.6 The amantadine and rimantadine binding sites in the M2 and p7 channels (a) The precise NMR structure of the AM2-BM2 chimeric channel with rimantadine determined in DHPC micelles and at pH 7.5.

On the right panel, one subunit of the tetrameric complex is removed to unveil the channel interior Bottom: amantadine binds to the peripheral pockets between the H2 and H3 helices; and a representative pocket among six equivalent pockets in the p7 hexamer 113 ]. The physical binding sites of amantadine and rimantadine have been identified in p7 of genotype 5a using intermolecular NOE experiments [60] . The NOE data revealed that amantadine or rimantadine binds to six equivalent hydrophobic pockets (due to the six-fold symmetry of the p7 channel) between the pore-forming and peripheral helices (Fig. 6.6b) . In each site, Leu52, Leu53, and Leu56 from H3 and Val25, Val26, and Phe20 from H2 appear to form a hydrophobic pocket that wraps around the adamantane cage of the drug. The amino group of amantadine or rimantadine is facing the largely hydrophilic channel lumen. An important property of the drug binding site is that it consists of elements from different helical segments and from different monomers. As rationalized above, permeation of cations through the p7 channel may depend on opening the narrow end of the funnel, which in turn depends on the reorientation of the helical segments. The binding of adamantane derivatives to the pocket may inhibit channel activity allosterically by causing the channel to close. Indeed, an NMR relaxation dispersion study showed that residues at the H1-H2 hinge (Phe19) and the narrow end of the cavity (Val7, Leu8) experienced substantial chemical exchanges (k ex~1 000 \u00b1 79 s \u22121 and ~10% excited state). This data is consistent with movements of the H1 helices that cause the tip of the funnel to open and close. More importantly, addition of rimantadine slowed down motion at the tip of the channel, as relaxation dispersion curve for Val7, which has significant chemical exchange in the apo state, is completely flat in the drug-bound state [114] . The dispersion curve of Phe19 is also significantly flatter, and individual curve fit yielded k ex value of 67 \u00b1 182 s \u22121 . Clearly, rimantadine binding makes the channel less dynamic.
