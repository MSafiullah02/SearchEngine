The leading producers of farmed raised shrimp in this hemisphere are Ecuador, Brazil, Honduras and Mexico. In terms of significant production from aquaculture, only two penaeid shrimp species have been significant in the Americas. Of these, Litopenaeus vannamei (the Pacific white shrimp; the taxonomy used in this review will follow Perez Farfante and Kensley, 1997) currently accounts for more than 95% of the total production. The second most important species is Litopenaeus stylirostris, the Pacific blue shrimp, and it once accounted for nearly 20% of the hemisphere\u2019s production. However, the high susceptibility of this species to WSSV and to new strains of TSV resulted in the near abandonment of the species in 1999\u20132000 by most of the industry (Zarain-Herzberg and Ascencio-Valle, 2001, Erickson et al., 2002, OIE, 2006b).",

Among the infectious diseases of cultured shrimp, certain virus-caused diseases stand out as the most significant and many of these are listed by the World Animal Health Organization (the OIE \u2013 Office International des Epizooties) (Table 1, Table 2\n). Some of the most important diseases (and their etiological agents) were once limited in distribution to either the Western or Eastern Hemisphere (Lightner, 1996a, Lightner, 1996b, Lightner, 2003a, Lightner, 2003b, Flegel and Alday-Sanz, 1998, OIE, 2006b). However, the international movement of live (for aquaculture) and dead (commodity shrimp for reprocessing, direct retail commerce, and for use as bait by sport fishermen) have been implicated or suspected as being responsible for the transfer and establishment of certain pathogens from Asia to the Americas (Lightner, 1996b, Durand et al., 2000, AQUIS, 2000, Hasson et al., 2006). While frozen commodity shrimp have been implicated as the route by which WSSV was moved from Asia to the Americas, TSV was moved in the opposite direction with infected live broodstock from Central America (Nunan et al., 1998b, Tu et al., 1999, Yu and Song, 2000, Durand et al., 2000, Tang and Lightner, 2005).",

            "text": "As a consequence of the rapid growth and development of the penaeid aquaculture industry, many of the most significant shrimp pathogens were moved from the regions where they initially appeared to new regions even before the \u201cnew\u201d pathogen had been recognized, named, proven to cause the \u201cnew\u201d disease, and before reliable diagnostic methods were developed. The diseases due to the shrimp viruses IHHNV, TSV and WSSV were all transferred with live shrimp stocks from country to country and from one continent to another well before their etiology was understood and diagnostic methods were available. With some diseases, the introduced pathogen encountered totally naive hosts with little or no innate resistance. The pandemics due to the penaeid viruses WSSV and TSV, and to a lesser extent to IHHNV, IMNV and YHV, have collectively cost the penaeid shrimp industry billions of dollars in lost crops, jobs, and export revenue (Table 2). The social and economic impacts of the pandemics caused by these pathogens have been profound in countries in which shrimp farming constitutes a significant industry. This paper reviews the current status of the virus diseases due to TSV, WSSV, IHHNV, IMNV, and YHV in the Americas in terms of their biology, history, distribution, production impacts, and the methods for their management in shrimp aquaculture in the Americas. Not included in this review will be information on the baculovirus caused diseases caused by Monodon baculovirus (MBV), Baculovirus penaei (BP) and Baculoviral midgut gland necrosis (BMN). Of these only BP is native (and enzootic) in wild American penaeids and is an occasional problem for shrimp farmers (Lightner, 1996a, OIE, 2006b). However, there is little new information on BP-caused disease in the Americas or elsewhere that is not well covered in other reviews (Lightner, 1996a, Flegel, 2006, OIE, 2006b).",

Shortly after its discovery in L. stylirostris, the virus was found in L. vannamei being cultured at the same facility in Hawaii and these L. vannamei were shown to be generally asymptomatic carriers of the virus (Lightner et al., 1983b, Bell and Lightner, 1984). Some members of populations of L. stylirostris and L. vannamei that survive IHHNV infections and/or epizootics, may carry the virus for life and pass the virus onto their progeny and other populations by horizontal and vertical transmission (Bell and Lightner, 1984, Lightner, 1996a, Morales-Covarrubias et al., 1999, Morales-Covarrubias and Chavez-Sanchez, 1999, Motte et al., 2003). IHHNV has been demonstrated by PCR (Motte et al., 2003) and by in-situ hybridization with IHHNV specific probes to be vertically transmitted in the oocytes (Fig. 4\nh).",

With RDS, affected shrimp present irregular, reduced growth and cuticular deformities and generally no remarkable elevation in mortality (Fig. 3c\u2013f) (Kalagayan et al., 1991, Browdy et al., 1993, Bray et al., 1994, Brock and Main, 1994, Lightner, 1996a). Hence, the economic and production impacts of IHHNV infection in L. vannamei are due to reduced and irregular growth and small count size shrimp at harvest and not to elevated mortality (OIE, 2006b). To mitigate this effect, several strategies have been used. With one strategy, selected lines of L. stylirostris were developed that were not only resistant to IHHN disease but also refractory to infection (Tang et al., 2000, Dhar et al., 2001). IHHNV-free lines of L. vannamei were also developed as SPF (specific pathogen-free) lines and these stocks were the first developed in the SPF stock development program (Wyban et al., 1992, Pruder et al., 1995, Moss et al., 2002).",

Molecular studies show considerable variation among Asian isolates of the virus (Tang et al., 2003, Krabsetsve et al., 2004, Tang and Lightner, 2006), while little variation was found in isolates from the Americas (Tang and Lightner, 2002). All isolates of IHHNV from the Americas are nearly identical with IHHNV from the Philippines. This finding, along with other aspects of its history and epidemiology of IHHN in the Americas, suggests that IHHNV was introduced from the Philippines, perhaps with live P. monodon that were imported in the early 1970s as a candidate aquaculture species during the very early development of shrimp farming in the Americas (Lightner, 1996b, Tang and Lightner, 2002, Tang et al., 2003).",

The first two genotypes (IHHNV-I and IHHNV-II) are infectious to the representative penaeids, L. vannamei and P. monodon, while the latter genetic variant has been demonstrated to be not infectious to these species (Tang et al., 2003, Krabsetsve et al., 2004, Tang and Lightner, 2006). The apparent reason for the lack of infectivity of the IHHNV-III genotype was recently explained by the discovery that the DNA fragment represented by IHHNV-III is incorporated into the genome of some genetically distinct populations of P. monodon in the Indo-Pacific region (Duda and Palumbi, 1999, Tang and Lightner, 2006, Tang et al., 2007).",

Vertically infected larvae and early PL do not become diseased, but in approximately 35-day-old or older juveniles, gross signs of the disease may be observed, followed by mass mortalities (Fig. 3a and b). In horizontally infected juveniles, the incubation period and severity of the disease is somewhat size and/or age dependent, with young juveniles always being the most severely affected. Infected adults seldom show signs of the disease or mortalities (Bell and Lightner, 1984, Bell and Lightner, 1987, Brock and Lightner, 1990, Lightner, 1993, Lightner, 1996a). Gross signs are not IHHN specific, but juvenile L. stylirostris with acute IHHN show a marked reduction in food consumption, followed by changes in behavior and appearance. Shrimp of this species with acute IHHN have been observed to rise slowly in culture tanks to the water surface, there to become motionless and then to roll-over and slowly sink (ventral side up) to the tank bottom. Shrimp exhibiting this behavior may repeat the process for several hours until they become too weak to continue, or until they are attacked and cannibalized by their healthier siblings. L. stylirostris at this stage of infection often have white or buff-colored spots (which differ in appearance and location from the white spots that sometimes occur in shrimp with WSSV infections) in the cuticular epidermis, especially at the junction of the tergal plates of the abdomen, giving such shrimp a mottled appearance (Fig. 3a\u2013b). This mottling later fades in moribund L. stylirostris as such individuals become more bluish. In L. stylirostris and in P. monodon with terminal phase IHHNV infections, moribund shrimp are often distinctly bluish in color, with opaque abdominal musculature (Lightner et al., 1983a, Lightner et al., 1983b, Brock and Lightner, 1990, Lightner, 1996a).",

The severity and prevalence of RDS in infected populations of juvenile or older L. vannamei may be related to infection during the larval or early PL stages (Kalagayan et al., 1991, Motte et al., 2003). RDS has also been reported in cultured stocks of L. stylirostris and P. monodon (Lightner, 1996a, Primavera and Quinitio, 2000). Juvenile shrimp with RDS may display a bent (45\u201390\u00b0 bend to left or right) or otherwise deformed rostrum, a deformed 6th abdominal segment, wrinkled antennal flagella, cuticular roughness, \u2018bubble-heads\u2019, and other cuticular deformities.

The coefficient of variation (CV = the standard deviation divided by the mean of different size groups within a population) for populations with RDS is typically greater than 30% and may approach 90%, while IHHNV-free (and thus RDS-free) populations of juvenile L. vannamei and L. stylirostris usually show CVs of 10\u201330% (Kalagayan et al., 1991, Browdy et al., 1993, Brock and Main, 1994, Carr et al., 1996, Lightner, 1996a, Motte et al., 2003).",

Intranuclear inclusion bodies due to IHHNV may be easily confused with developing intranuclear inclusion bodies due to WSSV infection (compare Fig. 4a\u2013d to Fig. 10a\u2013d).

However, molecular techniques using dot-blot and in-situ hybridization (ISH) tests for IHHNV have been developed and a number of methods and commercial products using these methods are available (OIE, 2006b). Non-radioactive digoxigenin-11-dUTP (DIG-11-dUTP)-labeled gene probes for IHHNV detection in dot-blot and ISH formats were the first developed for use in shrimp disease diagnostic applications (Mari et al., 1993). These DIG-labeled probes made the method safe and applicable to most laboratory and field situations (Carr et al., 1996, Lightner, 1996a, OIE, 2006b). DNA probes for dot-blot and ISH applications and PCR methods provide greater diagnostic sensitivity than do more traditional techniques for IHHN diagnosis that employ classic histological approaches. Furthermore, these methods have the added advantage of being applicable to nonlethal testing of valuable broodstock shrimp. A hemolymph sample may be taken with a tuberculin syringe, or an appendage (a pleopod for example) may be biopsied, and used as the sample for a direct dot-blot test (Bell et al., 1990, Carr et al., 1996, OIE, 2006b).",

These methods are applicable to routine diagnostic applications in disease situations and for use in surveillance and screening of shrimp stocks or populations to verify their health/disease status. PCR methods have been used to develop, maintain and document the SPF (specific pathogen-free) status of L. vannamei lines developed in the United States for use by the domestic and international shrimp farming industries (Wyban et al., 1992, Pruder et al., 1995, OIE, 2006b). A number of commercial PCR kits are available for IHHNV detection. There are multiple geographical variants of IHHNV, some of which are not distinguishable by all of the available methods for IHHNV (Tang and Lightner, 2002, Tang and Lightner, 2006, Tang et al., 2003). Several primers sets have shown utility in routine use. Among these are 70012F/77353R, 389F/R and 392F/R, and these appear to be the suitable for detecting all the known genetic variants of IHHNV. However, these primer sets do not distinguish infectious IHHNV from a non-infectious variant of IHHNV that is incorporated in the genome of some stocks of P. monodon from the Indian Ocean. Two additional primer sets, MG831F/R and IHHNV 309F/R, respectively, were developed to distinguish the shrimp genome associated variant of IHHNV from the infections free-virus variants (Table 3\n) (Tang and Lightner, 2006, Tang et al., 2007). The lessons learned from applying PCR detection methods to IHHNV and the resulting false positive tests for the virus in some stocks of P. monodon underscore the importance of confirming of unexpected positive and/or negative PCR results for IHHNV with a second primer set, or use of another diagnostic method (i.e. real-time PCR, bioassay, ISH).",

The genome of TSV consists of a linear, positive sense single-stranded RNA of 10,205 nucleotides, excluding the 3\u2032 poly-A tail, and it contains two large open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 contains the sequence motifs for nonstructural proteins, such as helicase, protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF 2 contains the sequences for TSV structural proteins, including the three major capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 (55, 40, and 24 kDa, respectively) (Bonami et al., 1997, Mari et al., 1998, Mari et al., 2002, Robles-Sikisaka et al., 2001). The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of host cells. Based on its characteristics, TSV has been assigned by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to the newly created genus Cripavirus in new family Dicistroviridae (in the \u201csuperfamily\u201d of picornaviruses) (Mayo, 2002a, Mayo, 2002b).",

Curiously, the strain of TSV in the early diagnostic cases from the Americas reacts with the monoclonal antibody MAb1A1, but all of the more recently emerged genetic variants of TSV from the Americas do not react with the antibody in Western blot transfers or in IHC (immuno-histochemistry) preparations with paraffin embedded TSV-infected tissues (Erickson et al., 2002, Erickson et al., 2005). Comparison of the cDNA sequence of TSV CP2 from approximately 50 TSV isolates in the author\u2019s collection shows that there are currently four distinct strains (or genetic variants) of the virus (Fig. 8\n) (Tang and Lightner, 2005).

Cumulative mortalities due to TSV epizootics have ranged from 40 to >90% in cultured populations of postlarval (PL), juvenile, and subadult L. vannamei. TS is best known as a disease of nursery- or grow-out-phase L. vannamei that occurs within \u223c14 to 40 days after stocking postlarvae into grow-out ponds or tanks, hence, shrimp with TS are typically small juveniles of from \u223c0.05 g to <5 g. Larger shrimp may also be affected, especially if they are not exposed to the virus until they are larger juveniles or subadults. Survivors of TSV infections may carry the virus for life (Brock et al., 1995, Brock et al., 1997, Hasson et al., 1999b, Lightner, 1996a, Lightner, 1996b, Lotz, 1997b). In regions where the virus is enzootic in farmed stocks, the prevalence of chronic phase TSV infections has been found in various surveys to range from 0% to 100% (Brock, 1997, Jimenez et al., 2000, Laramore, 1997). TSV can also infect other Western Hemisphere penaeid species (i.e. L. stylirostris, L. setiferus, and L. schmitti), sometimes resulting in disease and mortalities in PL or early juvenile stages, but also in asymptomatic persistent infections (Brock et al., 1997, Overstreet et al., 1997). Other Western Hemisphere penaeids (Farfantepenaeus aztecus and Fa. duorarum) and Eastern Hemisphere penaeids (Fenneropenaeus chinensis, P. monodon, and Marsupenaeus japonicus) have been experimentally infected with TSV, but appear not to develop clinical disease (Brock et al., 1997, Overstreet et al., 1997, Flegel, 2006).",

While wild postlarvae with TSV infections were reported as being found near shrimp farms with ongoing TSV epizootics (Lightner et al., 1995), TSV infections in wild shrimp have not been further documented, suggesting that TSV does not have a discernable impact on wild populations of shrimp (Brock, 1997). In 1998, TSV was documented in Taiwan in infected stocks of L. vannamei, introduced for aquaculture purposes (Tu et al., 1999, Yu and Song, 2000). In addition to being moved from country to country with live shrimp, there is also evidence that TSV has the potential of being transferred in frozen TSV-infected shrimp products. TSV has been found in frozen commodity shrimp (L. vannamei) products in samples from markets in the USA that originated in Latin America and south-east Asia. Improper disposal of wastes (liquid and solid, i.e. peeled shells, heads, intestinal tracts, etc.) from value-added reprocessing of TSV-infected shrimp at coastal locations may provide a source of TSV that may contaminate wild or farmed stocks near the point of the waste stream discharge (Lightner, 1996b, Nunan et al., 2004, OIE, 2006b).",

The virus was demonstrated to remain infectious for up to 48 h (after ingestion of TSV-infected shrimp carcasses) in the feces passed by wild or captive sea gulls (Larus atricilla) and chickens (Gallus domesticus, used as a laboratory surrogate for all shrimp-eating birds). These findings implicate birds as being an important mechanical vector for the transmission of the virus within affected farms or farming regions (Vanpatten et al., 2004). There is some evidence that flying aquatic insects such as the water boatman (Trichocorixa reticulata [Corixidae]) that feed on shrimp carcasses can also serve as mechanical vectors of TSV (Brock, 1997, Lightner, 1995, Lightner, 1996b).",

Following experimental or natural infection, Taura syndrome has three distinct phases in the disease: acute, transition and chronic (Brock, 1997, Hasson et al., 1999b) (Fig. 6). In disease outbreaks at farms, the onset of mortality is often sudden and massive with moribund shrimp coming to the pond surface or edges where large numbers of shrimp-eating birds may be attracted to the dead and dying shrimp. Moribund shrimp in the acute phase of the disease typically present a pink to reddish coloration due to expansion of red cuticular chromatophores (especially in the tail fan), are off feed and with empty guts, and they are lethargic (Fig. 6a). The acute phase is rapid in individual shrimp, probably lasting less than 24 h, but the acute phase in a shrimp farm pond may last for several days in an affected population (Brock, 1997, Garza et al., 1997, Hasson et al., 1999b). As implied by its name, the transition (or recovery in some publications) phase of Taura syndrome is that phase of the disease when affected shrimp may resolve the lesions due to TSV infection that developed in the acute phase. Shrimp in the transition phase typically present randomly distributed variably sized melanized lesions in or under the cuticle (exoskeleton) (Fig. 6b). Those shrimp that successfully resolve the acute-phase TSV lesions and survive the next molting process, typically appear normal. Death due to TSV infection during the three phases most often occurs in the acute phase, probably due to osmotic failure. In the transition phase of the disease, death may also occur due to osmotic failure as a consequence of widespread destruction of the cuticular epithelium or by systemic infections by opportunistic bacteria (Lightner, 1996a, Brock, 1997). Shrimp in the chronic phase of Taura syndrome may carry the virus for life as a persistent infection (Lotz, 1997b, Hasson et al., 1999b). While persistently infected L. vannamei may appear and behave normally, they show slightly less tolerance to low salinity stress than uninfected shrimp (Lotz et al., 2005). Some members of populations of L. vannamei or L. stylirostris that survive TSV infections and/or epizootics may carry the virus for life and, although not documented, pass the virus onto their progeny by vertical transmission (Hasson et al., 1999a, Hasson et al., 1999b, OIE, 2006b).",

            "text": "During the acute phase of TSV infections, the virus infects and replicates primarily in the cuticular epithelium (or hypodermis) of the general exoskeleton, foregut, hindgut, gills and appendages (Fig. 7a\u2013d), and often in the connective tissues, the hematopoietic tissues, and the antennal gland. The enteric organs (endoderm-derived hepatopancreas, midgut and midgut caeca mucosal epithelia) and smooth, cardiac, striated muscle, and the ventral nerve cord, its branches and its ganglia typically show no histological signs of infection by TSV and are usually negative for TSV by ISH (Lightner et al., 1995, Lightner, 1996a, Lightner, 1996b, Lightner, 2003a, Brock, 1997, OIE, 2006b). In H&E stained preparations, acute-phase TSV lesions (Fig. 7a\u2013d) are presented as multifocal areas of necrosis in the cuticular epithelium of the general body surface, appendages, gills, hindgut, and foregut (the esophagus, anterior and posterior chambers of the stomach). Prominent in the multifocal cuticular lesions are conspicuous foci of affected cells that display an increased eosinophilia of the cytoplasm and pyknotic or karyorrhectic nuclei. Cytoplasmic remnants of necrotic cells are often abundant in these TS acute-phase lesions and these are generally presented as spherical bodies (1\u201320 \u03bcm in diameter) that range in staining from eosinophilic to pale basophilic. These structures, along with pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei, give acute-phase TS lesions a characteristic \u2018peppered\u2019 or \u2018buckshot-riddled\u2019 appearance, which is considered to be pathognomonic for TS disease when there is no concurrent necrosis of the parenchymal cells of the lymphoid organ tubules (Fig. 7a\u2013b). The absence of necrosis of the lymphoid organ in acute-phase TSV infections distinguishes TS disease from acute phase yellow head disease in which similar patterns of necrosis to those induced by TSV may occur in the cuticular epithelium and gills (Lightner, 1996a, Bondad-Reantaso et al., 2001, OIE, 2006b). In TSV-infected tissues, pyknotic or karyorrhectic nuclei give a positive (for DNA) Feulgen reaction, which distinguishes them from the less basophilic to eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that do not contain DNA. The absence of hemocytic infiltration or other signs of a significant host-inflammatory response distinguishes the acute phase of TS from the transitional phase of the disease (Lightner, 1996a, Brock, 1997, Hasson et al., 1999a, Hasson et al., 1999b, OIE, 2006b).",

The masses of hemocytes may become melanized, giving rise to the irregular black spots that characterize the transition phase of the disease (Fig. 6b). In H&E sections, such lesions may show erosion of the cuticle, surface colonization and invasion of the affected cuticle and exposed surface hemocytes by Vibrio spp. (Fig. 7e) (Lightner, 1996a, Hasson et al., 1999b, OIE, 2006b). Sections of the lymphoid organ (LO) during the transition phase of TS may appear normal with H&E staining. However, when sections of the LO are assayed for TSV by ISH with a specific cDNA probe (or by IHC with MAb 1A1 for TSV type A, genotype 1), large quantities of TSV are shown being cleared and concentrated from the hemolymph in the more peripheral parenchymal cells of the LO tubules (Fig. 7f) (Hasson et al., 1999b, Srisuvan et al., 2005).",

Such LOS are accumulations of LO cells and hemocytes and may be distinguished from normal LO tissues by their spherical nature and the lack of the central vessel that is typical for normal lymphoid organ tubules (Fig. 7g\u2013h) (Anggraeni and Owens, 1998, Hasson et al., 1999b, Srisuvan et al., 2006). When assayed by ISH with a cDNA probe for TSV (or with MAB 1A1 using IHC) some cells in the LOS give positive reactions for the virus, with most of the ISH-positive cells occurring in the spheroids, while no other target tissues react (Fig. 7h) (Hasson et al., 1999b, Srisuvan et al., 2006).",

Non-radioactive, DIG-labeled cDNA probes for TSV may be produced in the laboratory. The ISH method provides greater diagnostic sensitivity than does more traditional methods for TSV detection and diagnosis that employ classic histological methods (Mari et al., 1998, Hasson et al., 1999a, Hasson et al., 1999b, Lightner, 1996a, Lightner, 1999, Lightner and Redman, 1998a). The ISH assay of routine histological sections of acute- and transition-phase lesions in the cuticular epithelium, other tissues, and of LOS in transition and chronic phase with a specific DIG-labeled cDNA probe to TSV provides a definitive diagnosis of TSV infection (OIE, 2006b). Pathognomonic TSV-positive lesions display prominent blue to blue-black areas in the cytoplasm of affected cells when reacted with the cDNA probes (Fig. 7c, d, f and h). Not reacting to the probe are the prominent karyorrhectic nuclear fragments and pyknotic nuclei that contribute to the pathognomonic \u2018buckshot-riddled\u2019 appearance of TS lesions (compare Fig. 7a and b with Fig. 7c and d). False-negative ISH results may occur with Davidson\u2019s fixed tissues if tissues are left in fixative for more than 24\u201348 h (Hasson et al., 1997, OIE, 2006b). The low pH of Davidson\u2019s fixative causes acid hydrolysis of the TSV single-stranded RNA genome, resulting in false-negative probe results. This artifact can be avoided through the use of neutral fixatives, including a\u2019RNA-friendly\u2019 fixative developed for shrimp, or by the proper use (avoiding fixation times over 24 h) of Davidson\u2019s fixative (Bell and Lightner, 1988, Hasson et al., 1997, Lightner, 1996b, Lightner and Redman, 1998a).",

WSSV is a very large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus with a density of approximately 1.2 g/ml. WSSV was recently assigned by the ICTV to its own new genus, Whispovirus, and family, Nimaviridae (Table 1) (Mayo, 2002a, Mayo, 2002b). Virions are large (80\u2013120 \u00d7 250\u2013380 nm), rod-shaped to elliptical, and with a trilaminar envelope (Wang et al., 1995, Durand et al., 1997, Inouye et al., 1994, Inouye et al., 1996, Kanchanaphum et al., 1998, van Hulten et al., 2001, Vlak et al., 2005, Greenwood et al., 2005). Negatively stained virions purified from shrimp hemolymph show unique, tail-like appendages (Fig. 1, Fig. 9\n) (Wang et al., 1995, Fauquet et al., 2005). The virions are generated in hypertrophied nuclei of infected cells without the production of occlusion bodies (Fig. 10). In initial reports, WSSV was described as a non-occluded baculovirus, but WSSV DNA sequence analysis has shown that it is not related to the baculoviruses (van Hulten et al., 2001, Yang et al., 2001). The size of the WSSV genome has been differently reported for different isolates: 305,107 bp (GenBank Accession No. AF332093), 292,967 bp (GenBank Accession No. AF369029) and 307,287 bp (GenBank Accession No. AF440570) for viruses isolated from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand and Taipei China, respectively. The sequences of these three isolates are almost identical, with the size differences being due mostly to several small insertions and one large (\u223c12 kbp) deletion. In accordance with a genome size of \u223c300 kb, a total of 531 putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified by sequence analysis, among which 181 ORFs are likely to encode functional proteins. Thirty-six of these 181 ORFs have been identified by screening and sequencing a WSSV cDNA library or else have already been reported to encode functional proteins, many of which show little homology to proteins from other viruses (OIE, 2003).",

These authors found that at temperatures above 32 \u00b0C WSD did not develop in WSSV infected L. vannamei, but when the same shrimp were cooled to 25 \u00b0C the disease would quickly develop with 100% mortality. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the hyperthemic phenomenon also occurred in other penaeids (Guan et al., 2003). Recent work has shown that replication of WSSV is significantly reduced or stopped under hyperthermic conditions (Du et al., 2006). These findings have helped to explain why WSD epizootics occur most often in the cooler seasons in most shrimp farming regions. In the Americas, that information has helped shrimp farmers manage around WSD by avoiding stocking in the cool season, and in some countries like Ecuador and Peru, growing shrimp year-around in temperature controlled greenhouses.",

White spot disease (WSD) caused by WSSV emerged in east Asia in 1992\u20131993 and it was quickly dispersed with infected seed and broodstock across the Asian continent to SE Asia and India where it caused a major pandemic, and continues to cause significant losses in some regions. WSD outbreaks were first reported from farmed Marsupenaeus japonicus in Japan in 1993 (Inouye et al., 1994, Inouye et al., 1996, Nakano et al., 1994) and the causative agent was named penaeid rod-shaped DNA virus (PRDV) or rod-shaped nuclear virus of Ma. japonicus (RV-PJ). Later, outbreaks of viral disease with similar gross signs and caused by similar rod-shaped viruses were reported from elsewhere in Asia and other names were applied: hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis baculovirus (HHNBV) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (Huang et al., 1995a, Huang et al., 1995b); white spot baculovirus (WSBV) and PmNOBIII in Taipei China (Chou et al., 1995, Lo et al., 1996); and systemic ectodermal and mesodermal baculovirus (SEMBV) or PmNOBII in Thailand (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995). The virus from the People\u2019s Republic of China has also been called Chinese baculovirus (CBV) (Lu et al., 1997, Nadala and Loh, 1998, Nadala et al., 1998). Shrimp exhibiting the gross signs and histopathology of WSD have also been reported from Korea (Kim et al., 1998), India (Karunasagar et al., 1998), the Philippines, and the USA (Lightner, 1996b, Durand et al., 2000). WSSV has even reached shrimp farms in southeastern Europe (1997) and the Middle East (1999) via live shrimp movements, and Australia and Spain with introductions of frozen infected shrimp, which were used as fresh food for broodstock (OIE, 2006b).",

            "text": "Beginning in 1999, WSD has also had a severe impact on the shrimp industries of both Central and South America (GAA, 1999a, GAA, 1999b, Durand et al., 2000, Vidal et al., 2001, Lightner, 2003a, Lightner, 2003b, OIE, 2006b). Despite the absence of evidence of live shrimp introductions from Asia to the Americas, WSSV was diagnosed at several sites in 1995\u20131997 in captive wild shrimp or crayfish and in cultured domesticated shrimp stocks in the eastern and southeastern US (Nunan et al., 1998b, Durand et al., 2000, Lightner et al., 2001). Early in 1999, WSSV was diagnosed as the cause of serious epizootics in Central American shrimp farms. By mid to late 1999, WSSV was causing major losses in Ecuador (then among the world\u2019s top producers of farmed shrimp), and by 2000\u20132001, export of shrimp from Ecuador was down nearly 70% from pre-WSSV levels (Rosenberry, 2001, Rosenberry, 2003, Lightner, 2003a). Although the documentation is sketchy, WSSV has been found in wild shrimp stocks in the Americas (Nunan et al., 2001, Chapman et al., 2004). In the US, the virus was successfully eradicated from shrimp farms and, except for an outbreak at an isolated shrimp farm on the Island of Kauai, Hawaii in 2004 (CEI, 2004, Ostrowski, 2004), it has not been reported from farmed shrimp stocks in the USA since 1997. However, its sporadic detection in wild shrimp stocks (Pacific Coast of Panama, Gulf of Mexico and SE Atlantic states) (Nunan et al., 2001, Chapman et al., 2004, Hasson et al., 2006) suggests that it has become established in wild penaeid shrimp stocks in coastal waters of the eastern Pacific and southeastern US and the Gulf of Mexico, or that it continues to be introduced perhaps with wastes (peeled shells, etc.) from value-added reprocessing of imported shrimp in coastal packing plants or from infected shrimp used as bait by sport fishermen. It has been proposed that the introductions of WSSV to the Americas were the result of importation of frozen shrimp products from WSSV-affected areas of Asia and the value-added reprocessing of those frozen shrimp for the US market in coastal processing plants (Nunan et al., 1998b, Durand et al., 2000, Lightner et al., 2001, Lightner, 2003a) or possibly due to the use of imported frozen WSSV-infected shrimp as bait by sport fishermen (Hasson et al., 2006). WSSV also reached Spain and Australia in 2000\u20132001. In both cases successful containment and eradication was reported, and for both events the importation and use of infected frozen shrimp as a fresh feed for broodstock was implicated as the route of introduction (OIE, 2003, Lightner, 2003b). Regardless of where they were obtained, isolates of WSSV have shown little genetic or biological variation, suggesting that the virus emerged and was spread from a single source (OIE, 2003, OIE, 2006b).",

The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the WSSV-infected cuticular epithelium.

The early stages of inclusion body development in WSD are eosinophilic, centronuclear, and with a halo (an artifact with Davidson\u2019s fixation). The early developing WSSV intranuclear inclusion bodies resemble the appearance of inclusion bodies due to infection by IHHNV, and consequently, at this stage the two diseases can be easily confused. However, the presence of larger, more fully developed, without a halo, pale basophilic inclusion bodies in infected target tissues during the advanced stages of infection clearly distinguishes the two diseases (Fig. 10a\u2013d). Usually WSSV infected nuclei contain a single inclusion body. To reach a differential diagnosis of infection by IHHNV and/or infection by WSSV it is advisable to use a second diagnostic method for one or both disease agents. The available and preferred options are ISH with specific DIG-labeled probes or PCR of parallel samples preserved for that purpose (Lightner, 1996b, OIE, 2006b).",

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of YHV-infected tissues shows enveloped bacilliform virions. They range from approximately 150 nm to 200 nm in length and from 40 nm to 50 nm in diameter and are located within vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells and in intercellular spaces. The virions arise from longer, filamentous nucleocapsids (approximately 15 nm \u00d7 130\u2013800 nm), which accumulate in the cytoplasm and obtain an envelope by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum into intracellular vesicles. Negatively stained YHV virions show regular arrays of short spikes on the viral envelope (Fig. 1, Fig. 11\n) (Boonyaratpalin et al., 1993, Chantanachookin et al., 1993, Lightner, 1996a).",

A closely related strain of YHV, named gill-associated virus (GAV), has been reported from Australian shrimp farms (Walker et al., 2001), and at least six genetic variant of the virus are now recognized (OIE, 2006b). Laboratory trials have shown that YHV can cause high mortality in representative cultured and wild penaeid species from the Americas (Lu et al., 1994, Lu et al., 1997, Lightner, 1999, Pantoja and Lightner, 2003). When it occurs in farms rearing P. monodon, YHD is characterized by high and rapid mortality, that is sometimes accompanied by the gross signs of yellowing of the cephalothorax (from which the disease got its name) and general bleaching of body color. In laboratory studies, American penaeids challenged with YHV did not develop yellow heads or signs of marked discoloration (Lightner and Redman, 1998a). YHV is potentially lethal to most of the commercially cultivated penaeid shrimp species (OIE, 2006a, OIE, 2006b).",

Subsequent to finding YHV in imported frozen commodity shrimp, the occurrence of YHD, co-occurring with WSD, was incorrectly reported in farmed shrimp from the Americas. Some early unpublished reports from \u223c1999 to 2000, were based on the presentation of severe necrosis of the lymphoid organ, a lesion once thought to be pathognomonic for YHD (Fig. 11b\u2013c) (Limuswan, 1991, Lightner, 1996a, Lightner et al., 1998, Lightner and Redman, 1998a, Pantoja and Lightner, 2003). However, the diagnosis of YHV infection in these cases was not confirmed with a second diagnostic method until after the errant diagnostic reports to diagnostic case submitters and to the OIE were released (Lightner, unpublished data). More recent work has shown that the presumptive histological diagnoses were due to severe infections with white spot virus, which can cause histopathology in the lymphoid organ, which mimics that occurring in severe acute YHD (Fig. 11b\u2013d) (Pantoja and Lightner, 2003).",

In the first of these reports, de la Rosa-V\u00e9lez et al. (2006) reported the discovery of suspect cases of YHV infections from shrimp farms along the Pacific coast of Mexico. From 39 samples from 26 randomly chosen shrimp farms, 11 YHV positive samples of L. vannamei were found by RT-PCR using primers specific for the virus (Tang and Lightner (1999). Further analysis of selected isolates using primers that amplify other regions of the YHV genome also gave positive results (de la Rosa-V\u00e9lez et al., 2006). Of considerable interest in the de la Rosa-V\u00e9lez et al. (2006) report was the general absence of notable mortalities in farms with the YHV positive shrimp. However, a laboratory challenge study with the putative YHV agent resulted in 50% mortality in 14 days in the indicator L. vannamei used to assay for the presence of YHV (de la Rosa-V\u00e9lez et al., 2006).",

According to FAO statistics the shrimp farming industry in Asia began to switch from culturing P. monodon to L. vannamei in 1999 and by 2005, more than half of the \u223c2 million metric tons of production from the region was L. vannamei (FAO, 2006).

ORF 1 encodes a RNA-binding protein and a capsid protein. The coding region of the RNA-binding protein is located in the first half of ORF 1 and contains a dsRNA-binding motif. The second half of ORF 1 encodes a capsid protein with a molecular mass of 106 kDa. ORF 2 encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Based on these characteristics, IMNV is most similar to members of the Totiviridae (Poulos et al., 2006).",

The disease was first described in cultured L. vannamei in northeast Brazil (Lightner, 2003a). IMN causes significant disease and mortalities in juvenile and subadult pond-reared stocks of L. vannamei. In 2003, IMN was reported to have been responsible for millions of dollars in losses in northeast Brazil and by 2004 losses due to IMN in the affected regions of Brazil were estimated at $20 million (Nunes et al., 2004). More recent estimates for IMN losses from 2002 to 2006 in Brazil exceed $100 million (Brazilian Shrimp Farmers Association, unpublished) (Table 2). In Brazil, outbreaks of the disease seemed to be associated with certain types of environment and physical stresses (i.e. extremes in salinity and temperature, collection by cast-net, etc.), and possibly with the use of low quality feeds (Lightner, 2003a). Although IMN seemed to be confined to the NE of Brazil, the disease spread to SE Asia and was reported from Indonesia in May 2006 (Wilkinson, 2006). Because of the ever increasing importance of L. vannamei in the Asia\u2013Pacific and the large scale trans-boundary movement and culture of the species, IMNV was considered important for the region and it was added in January 2006 to the NACA/FAO/OIE (Asian Region) Quarterly Aquatic Animal Disease Report list for the purpose of surveillance and reporting.",

To date, IMN appears to be limited to northeast Brazil, but shrimp with similar gross signs have been also reported from other countries of the Caribbean region where L. vannamei are cultured (Lightner, 1993). Affected shrimp present focal to extensive white necrotic areas in the striated muscle, especially of the distal abdominal segments and tail fan (Fig. 12b and c). These may become necrotic and reddened in some individual shrimp. These signs may have a sudden onset following stresses (e.g. capture by cast-net, feeding, sudden changes in temperature or salinity, etc.). Severely affected moribund shrimp may have been feeding just before the onset of stress and will have a full gut (Fig. 12b). Such severely affected shrimp become moribund and mortalities can be instantaneously high and continue for several days. Exposure of the paired lymphoid organs (LO) by simple dissection will show that the paired LO are hypertrophic to twice or more their normal size (Fig. 12d).",

Common locations for ectopic LOS include the hemocoelom in the gills, heart, near the antennal gland tubules, and ventral nerve cord. In some histological preparations, perinuclear pale basophilic to darkly basophilic inclusion bodies are evident in muscle cells, connective tissue cells, hemocytes, and in cells that comprise lymphoid organ spheroids. When tested by ISH with a specific DIG-labeled cDNA probe to IMNV, these inclusions react with the probe reflecting their presumed high content of IMNV (Lightner et al., 2004, Tang et al., 2005, Poulos et al., 2006). In addition to gross signs and histopathology, diagnostic methods using DIG-labeled cDNA probes to the virus, one step, nested and real-time RT-PCR have been developed for the detection of IMNV (Tang et al., 2005, Poulos et al., 2006, Poulos and Lightner, 2006, Andrade et al., 2007).

            "text": "Until the WSSV pandemic, the penaeid shrimp farming industry in Asia and the Americas remained largely dependent on wild shrimp for stocking its farms, and biosecurity was not part of the shrimp farming industry\u2019s vocabulary. The farming of essentially wild shrimp stocks was accomplished by the practice of collection and use of wild seed (postlarvae) for stocking of its farms directly or by the use of captive wild broodstock for the production of seed stock in hatcheries. This dependence fostered the intensification and spread of the viral diseases in shrimp aquaculture and in wild populations. The shrimp farming industry, as a whole, recognized this fact and has begun to change its farming practices in order to continue to develop, if not survive. While many of the shrimp stocks currently used to stock farms are produced from captive wild broodstock, only those that test negative for WSSV in Asia and WSSV and TSV in the Americas are used to stock biosecure farms. Biosecure production systems (that are designed to exclude potentially infected wild shrimp seed) stocked with shrimp stocks known to be free of the major shrimp pathogens have become a common practice in many shrimp growing regions. A further sign of a maturing industry is its movement towards the expanded development and use of specific pathogen-free (SPF) domesticated shrimp stocks of the most important shrimp species (Pruder et al., 1995, Lotz, 1997a, Lotz, 1997b, Lightner and Redman, 1998b, Moss et al., 2002, Lightner, 2003b, Lightner, 2005, Lee and O\u2019Bryen, 2003). Domesticated lines L. vannamei are now the dominant shrimp farmed in Asia. The rapid change over of the industry to L. vannamei from P. monodon was due in large part to disease (FOA, 2006). Domesticated stocks made it possible to better manage the health status of the farmed stocks, and with L. vannamei SPF domesticated lines were readily available (Lightner, 2005, FAO, 2006). These progresses have advanced the technologies used to farm shrimp and made the industry far more sustainable than it was before the emergence of the virus-caused diseases discussed in the present paper.",
