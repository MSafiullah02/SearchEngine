Recently, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) has been identified in pigs in the USA that is associated with porcine dermatitis nephropathy syndrome, acute myocarditis and multisystemic inflammation, etc. Genetic heterogeneity of PCV2 has been studied in Indian pig population. Different genotypes like PCV2a-2D, PCV2b-1C, PCV2d and recombinant strain between PCV2a-2C and PCV2b-1C are reported from different studies. PCV2 has been discovered in human faeces, human vaccines and beef. But its pathogenicity in humans is not clear. PCV detection is based on common golden standard techniques including nucleic acid and antigen detection in the tissues, in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using monoclonal or polyclonal antibody against PCV2, respectively. The commercial vaccines available are effective in reducing the severity of clinical diseases and improving production parameters. Recently, antiviral compounds have also shown promising results against PCV2. This chapter summarizes aetiology, epidemiology, transmission, immunopathobiology, diagnosis, prevention and control of porcine circovirus.",

            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is a small non-enveloped icosahedral virus containing a circular single-stranded DNA genome. It was first recognized in 1974 as a contaminant in porcine kidney cell line (PK-15) without any cytopathic effect (Tischer et al. 1974) . Under experimental condition, this virus did not produce any aliment in pigs (Tischer et al. 1986 ). Later on in 1991, a novel PCV associated with a sporadic disease called as post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), characterized by weight loss, respiratory distress, jaundice, etc., was reported from Saskatchewan, Canada (Harding 1996; Clark 1997) . The variant which was associated with PMWS was designated as PCV2 and the non-pathogenic one as PCV1 (Meehan et al. 1998) . Retrospective study revealed that PCV2 has been circulating in pig population more than a decade (Jacobsen et al. 2009 ). As clinical disease was reproduced experimentally when PCV2 was inoculated along with other infectious or non-infectious agent, it was considered as necessary but not sufficient factor to develop clinical disease Ellis 2003) .",

PCVAD was recognized as a globally emerging disease, having huge impact on swine industry causing severe economic loss. Although PCV2 infection is ubiquitous, the prevalence of clinical disease is lower and the most common form is PCV2 subclinical infection (PCV2-SI) (Segal\u00e9s 2012) . The economic impact of PMWS and PCV2-SI for the pig industry, England for the year 2008, prior to introduction of vaccination was estimated to be \u00a352.8 million and \u00a388 million per year, respectively, during epidemic period (Alarcon et al. 2013) . In 2016, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) was identified in pigs in the USA associated with porcine dermatitis nephropathy syndrome, acute myocarditis and multisystemic inflammation, etc. (Phan et al. 2016; Palinski et al. 2017 ). PCV3 is not strongly genetically related to other PCV and it has been observed that PCV3 has emerged over the last 50 years (Saraiva et al. 2018) .

            "text": "PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 belong to genus Circovirus under family Circoviridae. They are small, non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses containing single-stranded negative-sense circular DNA genome organized in a typical ambisense pattern. The genome sizes for PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 are 1759 nucleotides, 1767-1768 nucleotides and 2000 nucleotides, respectively. PCV1 and PCV2 contain eleven predicted open reading frames (ORF), out of which ORF1, ORF5, ORF7 and ORF10 are encoded by positive strand and transcribed clockwise and others (ORF2, ORF3, ORF4, ORF6, ORF8, ORF9 and ORF11) are encoded by negative strand or complementary strand and transcribed anticlockwise (Hamel et al. 1998; He et al. 2013) . ORF1 and ORF2 are major open reading frames which are oriented in opposite direction. ORF1 encodes for replication protein and ORF2 for capsid protein which is having immunodominant antigenic epitopes. ORF1 of PCV1 and PCV2 share 83% nucleotide identity and 86% amino acid identity whereas ORF2 of PCV1 and PCV2 share 67% nucleotide and 65% amino acid sequence identity. The rep protein of PCV3 shared 55% identity to rep protein of bat and 48% identity to rep protein of PCV2, and the cap protein of PCV3 shared 35% amino acid identity to bat circoviruses and 24-26% amino acid identity to PCV1 and PCV2, respectively (Phan et al. 2016) . ORF3 is one of the major proteins of PCV and also most variable protein with 60% amino acid identity between PCV1 and PCV2. ORF3 region is embedded within ORF1 region and oriented in opposite direction. The ORF3 protein of PCV2 is involved in apoptosis. The fourth one ORF4 has been suggested to be located in ORF3 region and transcribed in the same direction. The PCV1 and PCV2 have 83% predicted amino acid identity for ORF4. It plays an important role in suppressing caspase activity and regulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte population (Hamel et al. 1998; He et al. 2013) . The multiplication of PCV is speculated to involve rolling circle method Mankertz et al. 2004; Phan et al. 2016) . The viruses mainly rely on host-encoded protein because of their limited encoding capacity. PCV2 requires actively multiplying cells for replication (Tischer et al. 1987; Mankertz et al. 2004 ).",

North American laboratories considered grouping into North American isolate, PCV2a, which comes under PCV2 group 2 and European-like isolates, PCV2b, which is under PCV2 group 1 (Gagnon et al. 2007 ). PCV2 strains were divided into three different genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2c) based on proportion of different nucleotide sites in ORF2 . PCV2a was subdivided in four clusters (2A to 2D) and PCV2b into three clusters (1A to 1C) (Olvera et al. 2007 ). PCV2a was predominant genotype in pig population worldwide since 2000. PCV2b has been present in Europe and Asia since 1997 and PCV2c was identified in archived serum samples from Denmark . Later on, in 2009, two new genotypes PCV2d and PCV2e were detected (Wang et al. 2009; Zhai et al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2015) . Emergence of new recombinant genotype PCV1/2a, having ORF1 of PCV1 and ORF2 of PCV2, has been reported in Canada with very low prevalence rate in 2008 . In Northeast India, emergence of PCV2a and PCV2b has been reported (Bhattacharjee et al. 2015) . A novel genotype PCV2f was reported in three out of 23 PCV2 strains identified from the archived pig tissue samples collected between 1996 and 1999 in China (Bao et al. 2018) . After introduction of PCV2 vaccination in the USA in 2006, PCV2d-2 is found to be predominant genotype in the USA which is a second genotypic shift after a major genotypic shift in mid-2000 replacing PCV2a with PCV2b (Xiao et al. 2016) .",

The speculation is that co-infections may enhance replication of PCV2 and their accumulation in immune cells or interfere with clearance of virus by changing cytokine profile (Opriessnig and Halbur 2012; Segal\u00e9s et al. 2013 ).",

Potentiation of PCV2 replication after immunostimulation may be due to massive activation of certain cells like macrophages in lymphoid system. The effect of immune suppression on PCVAD has also been studied.

In 2015, this novel circovirus, PCV3, was detected in the USA from three pigs showing cardiac lesions and multi-organ inflammation through metagenomic analysis (Phan et al. 2016) . Again PCV3 was reported from a case of PDNS and reproductive failure in the USA through metagenomic sequencing (Palinski et al. 2017) . In 2016, PCV3 was detected for the first time in China from pyretic and pneumonic piglets (Shen et al. 2017) . In China, PCV3 was identified in 24 out of 35 farms and suspected to be an important factor in reproductive failure (Ku et al. 2017) . PCV3 was detected in 132 out of 222 cases without any clinical infection signs from Shandong province, China (Zheng et al. 2017) . In Korea, 44.2% (159/360) and 72.6% (53/73) PCV3 prevalence is reported at individual and farm level, respectively, using pen side oral fluid sample (Kwon et al. 2017) . In Europe, PCV3 was detected in 12 out of 14 Polish farms and in PCV3-positive farms, PCV3 was detected in 5.9% to 65% serum pools by real-time PCR out of total 1050 serum samples collected between 2014 and 2017 (Stadejek et al. 2017 ).

PCV2 antigen was also demonstrated in the cytoplasm of a macrophage and fibroblasts of seminal vesicles with PCV2 DNA in the semen of an 11-month-old boar having history of illness and infertility by nested PCR (Opriessnig et al. 2006b ). PCV2 can be transmitted via artificial insemination with semen spiked with PCV2. It was observed in an experiment where PCV2-free mature female pigs were artificially inseminated with PCV2 DNA-negative semen spiked with PCV2a and PCV2b. Viraemia was observed in both groups in comparison to control group, those artificially inseminated with PCV2 DNA-negative semen. Sows inseminated with PCV2a-spiked semen failed to become pregnant and sows inseminated with PCV2b semen gave birth to viraemic live-born piglets, PCV2-infected stillbirth and mummified foetuses (Madson et al. 2008 ).",

Acidic medium, i.e. endosome-lysosomal acidification, is required for PCV2 multiplication (Misinzo et al. 2008) . After entry into cells, PCV2 DNA enters into the nucleus with the help of many cellular factors and multiplies there by rolling circle model. PCV DNA replication is initiated during S phase of growth as many required cellular enzymes are expressed during this phase (Tischer et al. 1987) . HSP 70 and HSP 27 positively regulate DNA replication whereas cyclin A and HMG co-A reductase negatively regulate replication (Liu et al. , 2014 Tang et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2014 ). The ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) is required for effective PCV2 replication, viral protein expression and RNA transcription in a cell cycle-dependent manner (Cheng et al. 2014 ). The ORF3 causes degradation of regulator of G protein signalling 16 (RGS 16) through ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) and enhances translocation of nuclear factor kappa B into the nucleus through extracellular signalling pathways (ERP 1/2) resulting in increased virus proliferation and increased IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA transcript leading to more inflammatory response around host cells during the early stage of PCV2 infection (Choi et al. 2015) . Progeny viruses begin to appear after 30 h postinfection.",

The virus multiplies in lymphoblastoid cells and causes its lysis (Rodr\u00edguez-Cari\u00f1o et al. 2011) .

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1) also plays a vital role in regulating PCV2-induced apoptosis ). Decreased proliferative activity in lymphoid cell could also be a major cause of lymphoid depletion (Mandrioli et al. 2004) .

The affected herds include gilt startups and new populations. PCV2 also replicates in an embryo and may lead to embryonic death and return to oestrus. In a small proportion of embryos, PCV2 did not have any detrimental effect on their development before 21 days of pregnancy (Mateusen et al. 2007 ).",

Microscopically, lymphohistiocytic to granulomatous inflammatory lesions were observed in lymphoid tissues mainly the tonsil, spleen, Payer's patches and one to more lymph nodes, lung, liver, kidney, heart and intestine. The characteristic lesions in lymphoid tissue include lymphoid depletion and histiocytic replacement both in follicular and parafollicular area. Multinucleated giant cells are frequently seen. Macrophages containing sharply demarcated spherical basophilic intracytoplasmic botryoid inclusion bodies may also be observed. Scoring system for lesion severity has also been described . Necrotizing lymphadenitis has also been described in at least one lymph node of 10% pigs suffering from PCV2-SD which may be due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the endothelium of blood vessels and subsequent thrombosis of blood vessels (Segal\u00e9s et al. 2004; Galindo-Cardiel et al. 2011) . Other microscopic lesions are lymphohistiocytic or granulomatous interstitial pneumonia with rare peribronchiolar fibrosis, mild to severe necrotizing bronchiolitis in the lung, interstitial lymphoplasmocytic or granulomatous or mixed-type nephritis, granulomatous enteritis, lymphohistiocytic hepatitis with disorganization of hepatic cords along with apoptosis and perilobular fibrosis in the liver, etc. Lymphohistiocytic and plasmacytic vasculitis has also been observed. Acute necrotizing myocarditis or chronic fibrosing myocarditis along with chronic vasculitis has been reported in PCV2-affected cases (Opriessnig et al. 2006c ). Brain lesions are of rare occurrence in PCV2-SD, but lymphohistiocytic vasculitis associated with haemorrhage or lymphohistiocytic meningitis in the cerebellum; degeneration and necrosis of grey and white matter have been reported (Correa et al. 2007; Seeliger et al. 2007; Segal\u00e9s 2012) .",

Both IHC and ISH were able to detect PCV2 in tissues that were stored in formalin for up to 6 months . Nonradioactive digoxigenin probes targeting ORF1 region of PCV1 and ORF2 of PCV2 are also in use to differentiate two viruses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples (Kim and Chae 2001) . Double ISH using double labelling like digoxigenin and biotinylated probes is used to detect PPV and PCV2 simultaneously in tissue samples, respectively (Kim and Chae 2002) . The IHC is more rapid and less expensive than ISH for routine use in laboratory (Sorden et al. 1999) . A strong correlation has been observed between the amount of PCV2 and severity of microscopic lesions (Rosell et al. 1999) .",

Multiplex PCR is used to detect and differentiate between PCV1 and PCV2 (Larochelle et al. 1999) . Multiplex nested PCR assays have been described for simultaneous detection of PCV1, PCV2 and PPV (Kim and Chae 2003) . Multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of six swine viruses such as CSFV, PRRSV, PCV2, JEV, PPV and porcine pseudorabies virus is a very useful approach for clinical diagnosis in mixed infection (Xu et al. 2012 ). Real-time PCR assays both SYBR Green and TaqMan-based assays have been developed for accurate and rapid quantification of PCV in serum and tissue samples for early detection of disease as it is a more sensitive method, for correlating virus load with extent of disease, for post-vaccination tracking of viral load in different tissues and for evaluating potency of developmental vaccine (Zhao et al. 2010; Nan-Chang et al. 2010) . A severe PCV2-associated lesion was found to be associated with more than or equal to 10 7 (Brunborg et al. 2004) . Multiplex real-time PCR is in use for differentiation of various PCV2 genotypes ). An ORF2-based PCR has also been used for differentiation between PCV1 and PCV2 and for differentiation of various PCV2 genotypes, respectively (Fenaux et al. 2000; Hamel et al. 2000) . Recently, duplex nanoparticle-based PCR has been developed for detection of PCV2 and PCV3 (Zhang et al. 2018) .",

Currently available commercial vaccines have shown effectiveness in reducing severity of clinical diseases and improving production parameters.

Vaccination of breeding boar decreases viraemia, systemic viral load and subsequently shedding of virus in semen, which is helpful in controlling vertical transmission of virus through semen. Vaccination of breeding sow also decreases systemic virus load in sow, decreases quantity of virus transferred to progeny during gestation and pre-weaning period and increases neutralizing antibody against PCV2 in colostrum. And passive immunity in the form of maternal antibody decreases pre-weaning mortality and improves average daily weight gain in the offspring. Vaccines administered to growing pigs have shown to decrease virus load and mortality and increase growth performances. Vaccination in the presence of maternal antibody has resulted in decreased vaccine efficacy. But in another study, vaccination in the presence of maternal antibody has been found to be effective (Fort et al. 2008; Opriessnig et al. 2008; Beach and Meng 2012) .",
