Targeted patient groups include: (1) admitted patients with chronic kidney disease stages 4 to 5 who were transitioned to HD during their current admission and who are expected to have a prolonged hospital stay, and (2) patients with unresolved AKI who have not been started on kidney replacement therapy and who are appropriate candidates for PD. In the event that we still cannot meet our dialysis demands, we would then consider switching maintenance HD patients temporarily to PD while in the inpatient setting. The acute PD program is being applied to all admitted patients regardless of their COVID-19 infection status. Patients with AKI who require urgent clearance (hyperkalemia, with potassium level > 6.0 mEq; severe uremic symptoms such as pericardial effusions or seizures; and severe acidosis, with pH < 7.2), as well as prone patients, were not considered good candidates for acute PD and it was recommended that they have HD catheters placed instead. A major challenge was timing, specifically when the acute PD program would be implemented. We elected to transition to acute PD when we reached 75% of maximal HD (including continuous HD) capacity.",
