Compared to short, keywords queries, higher accuracy of BERT were observed on long, natural language queries, demonstrating BERT's ability in extracting rich information from complex queries. These results show the potential of using query expansion to generate better queries for BERT-based rankers. In this work, we explore BERT's sensitivity to the addition of structure and concepts. We find that traditional word-based query expansion is not entirely applicable, and provide insight into methods that produce better experimental results.",

In such situations, automatically expanding queries is a popularly accepted approach to add new terms and add additional context for the search engine [1] . We hypothesize that while BERT would benefit from expansion, traditional techniques may not be suitable as they do not contain inherent word order, and further lack natural language structure relating them. This paper explores methods of expanding on an original query in a BERTbased reranker. We distinguish between two means of expanding the original query: first by adding structural words that help create a coherent natural language sentence, and second, by adding additional terms to add new concepts to the original query. We show that neither of the two are individually sufficient, and in-fact a combination of the two benefits reranking with BERT the most.",

Classic query expansion techniques expand the original query with terms selected from related documents; terms are usually added as a bag-of-words [1, 9] . There is prior research that shows classic query expansion to be effective for a few neural ranking models where query terms and document terms are matched softly [10] .

It has been previously shown that applying a BERT reranker using descriptive queries written in natural language provide impressive performance gains over using classic keywords queries [2] . We hypothesize that this is due to a combination of two factors. First, the sentence structure in natural language that draws relations between different concepts, and second, the introduction of new concepts that are closely tied with the underlying information need.

We therefore utilize two methods to gauge BERT's sensitivity to structure: GeneratedStructure and TemplateStructure. GeneratedStructure uses a neural machine translation approach to generate new, synthetic questions from the original keyword question. This could have good practical use if proved an effective technique. We adopt the approach proposed in [5] . As shown in Table 1 , GeneratedStructure tends to copy the keywords and adds a few question words, adding structure without new concepts. TemplateStructure tests the maximum possible range of benefit from adding structure to queries. It uses a templating process by hand, manually converting the keyword queries to a question using one of several templates. Queries can be reformulated into \"who, what, when, why, how\" questions or a request to \"describe xyz\". These templated questions were generated by the authors, with care being taken to restrict addition of new words other than to relate keyword query words with each other. All original keyword terms are ensured to be included in the reformulation as well. The templated questions provides an upper bound of the effectiveness of expanding with structure.",

This leads us to conclude that structure alone does not provide much evidence for short queries, as short queries do not contain too many complex relations between them; structure is more important with addition of additional keywords, where they help to build the complex relations between the many concepts. Table 3 reveals that adding expansion terms to Indri produces results that are better than Indri-LM and Indri-SDM, but significantly worse than most BERT rerankers. On training ClassicQEConcepts, with the classical Indri-QE expansion terms, we find that the model under-performs all other BERT models. This indicates that classic query expansion using discrete terms is not suitable for BERT-based deep language models. From Table 1 , classic QE expand the query with 'gene dna genome genes research', which is a bag of discrete words and lacks natural language structure that BERT is trained on [4] . This experiment helps establish that the new keywords and concepts must be related to each other in some coherent form, and that these relations actually benefit the ranking process.",

A win-loss analysis reveals that Google queries improve the original query by providing new concepts as well as several reformulations of the original query. Often, few but meaningful follow-up questions are more useful than several unrelated ones. Further, rephrasing the original sentence in multiple ways benefits the reranker. For instance for the query \"opening adoption records\", the questions \"Are adoption records public?\", and \"Should adoption records be open?\" give a boost of +0.3 in NDCG@5. This behaviour has been previously studied in previous work [15] wherein BERT favors text sequence pairs that are close in semantic meaning. Often, synonyms and multiple paraphrased versions of the original intent benefit the reranker. On the other hand, without filtering, the GoogleQuestions model does not produce any improvement in performance. This is mainly due to the off-topic questions, which take up about 60% of all retrieved queries. Our results reveal promising direction of query expansion for BERT using related questions that people often searched together. We show that these natural questions, when on-topic, provide valuable information to the original keyword queries, and are more effective than class query expansions or solely adding structures.",
