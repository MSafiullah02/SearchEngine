However, comprehensive knowledge of COVID-19 remains incomplete and many important features are still unknown. This manuscripts conduct a meta-analysis and a sensitivity study to answer the questions: What is the basic reproduction number? How long is the incubation time of the disease on average? What portion of infections are asymptomatic? And ultimately, what is the case fatality rate? Our studies estimate the basic reproduction number to be 3.15 with the 95% interval (2.41, 3.90), the average incubation time to be 5.08 days with the 95% confidence interval (4.77, 5.39) (in day), the asymptomatic infection rate to be 46% with the 95% confidence interval (18.48%, 73.60%), and the case fatality rate to be 2.72% with 95% confidence interval (1.29%, 4.16%) where asymptomatic infections are accounted for.",

            "text": "Since the first case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was found in Wuhan, P. R. China in December 2019, the disease has rapidly spread in the city of Wuhan, then to Hubei Province, China, and subsequently, across the world [1]. On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth transmissions for which infected patients may be asymptomatic or exhibit only flu-like symptoms in the early stage. Undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling threat to the public health. To understand the drastically negative impacts of COVID-19 on the public health, it is urgent to investigate key features pertinent to the disease: How severe is the transmission? How long is the incubation time of the disease on average? How many infections are asymptomatic? And ultimately, what is the case fatality rate?",

If the basic reproduction number R 0 is larger than 1, the outbreak is regarded as self-sustaining unless control measures are implemented to mitigate the transmission [5] . Defined as the time from the moment of exposure to the virus until signs and symptoms of COVID-19 appear, the incubation time of a COVID-19 infected patient provides a useful measure for the disease development. Knowing the average incubation time of the COVID-19 patients is important for disease surveillance.",

Simulations of the epidemic have been published under various assumptions to delineate hidden transmissions of the virus [5] . While estimates of those important quantities have been reported in the literature, those results are quite different and vary considerably from study to study. There has been a lack of consensus of those estimates because of serious concerns on the heterogeneity among the studies. Different studies have been carried out on different patients under different conditions, and different authors may make different model assumptions. Interpreting the available findings must be coupled with the associated features of the studies.",

Insufficient test kits do not allow every potential patient with COVID-19-like symptoms to be tested, and there has been a good portion of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers who would never be tested and counted as confirmed cases. It is useful to understand the asymptomatic infection rate, defined as the ratio of the number of asymptomatic infections to the number of all infected cases.",

Our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of key measures of COVID-19 by taking into account of the heterogeneity and measurement error effects which are intrinsically associated with COVID-19 data.

Forty-three articles were found with the theme on the basic reproduction number, the incubation period, the percentage of asymptomatic cases, and the case fatality rate. Among those articles, 20 articles, described in Table 1 , were identified by the first author (W.H.) to be included in the analysis, together with [24, 25] which were found on April 2. The inclusion criteria are the availability of both point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (or equivalently, standard deviations) for the basic transmission number, the average incubation time, the asymptomatic rate, or the case fatality rate. Table 1 presents the summary information of the selected articles together with the descriptions of the data used in those articles. We extract the results for the basic reproduction number from [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10] and the results for the average incubation time from [3, 4, 8, 12, 15] . The results from [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] are extracted for estimation of the asymptomatic infection rate. The estimates for the case fatality rate together with their 95% confidence intervals are taken from [10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18] . In the articles [4, 6, 8] , the reported 95% confidence intervals were asymmetric which we suspect were caused by employing a transformation (such as the exponential transformation) to the initial confidence intervals for the reparameterized effective size; for example, some authors may apply the logarithm to reparameterize the basic reproduction number or the average incubation time before performing the analysis. Using the inverse transformation, we convert the reported asymmetric confidence intervals and work out the associated standard deviations which are used in determining the weights for the meta-analysis.",

Suppose K studies report an estimate and the associate standard deviation for an effect size of interest. For the ith study with i = 1, ..., K, let Y i denote the effect size of interest and let \u03c3 2 i represent its associated variance estimate.

[23] Serra [24] Day [25] Meta\u2212Random portion of asymptomatic infections are not counted when estimating the case fatality rate. Our sensitivity study addresses this important issue and makes an adjustment to provide a sensible estimate of the case fatality rate. Compared to the estimated 3.34% case fatality rate obtained from the meta-analysis, our sensitivity study estimates the case fatality rate to be 1.8% with 95% confidence interval (1.18%, 2.43%) where asymptomatic infections are accounted for. Our studies reveal sensible estimates for the important quantities of COVID-19 by accommodating discrepancy effects associated with different studies such as the variability of the data collected from different populations at different time periods. With the evolution of the pandemic, the basic production number can greatly reduce as a result of the implementation of active measures to mitigate the virus spread. The estimation of the case fatality rate may be closer to the true case fatality rate because of the increase of the test capacity; more infected cases may be detected so the reported number of infections would be closer to the true number of COVID-19 carriers. Our results are useful in enhancing the knowledge of COVID-19. Though we focus on evaluating the basic reproduction number, the average incubation time, the asymptomatic infection rate, and the case fatality rate, other features, such as the time from symptom onset to hospitalization or to death and the morbidity rate of the disease, are also important and they are worth being estimated in a sensible way.",

With more studies available for categorizing the case fatality rate or the incubation time, it is useful to apply the meta-analysis to estimate those measures by stratifying the population based on the demographic and clinical characteristics. When data at the individual level are available, better estimates of key features for COVID-19 can be obtained and the pandemic trend can be more reasonably projected using statistical regression models.",
