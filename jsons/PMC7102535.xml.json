            "text": "The outbreak of an epidemical pneumonia with initially unknown reasons in December 2019 in Wuhan, China was ultimately found to be caused by a new virus, the \u201c2019 novel Coronavirus\u201d (2019-nCoV) or SARS-CoV-2 formally named by the World Committee on Virus Classification,1, 2, 3 and the disease caused by this virus was named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization.4\n,\n5 This virus has a characteristic crown representing the spike peplomers on the viral envelope, with strong infectivity and general susceptibility to people of all ages and across the globe. On the 8th February 2020, the disease was named as \u201cNovel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP)\u201d in China.6 By February 16, 2020, China had reported a cumulative total of 70,548 patients being infected with SARS-CoV-2, 57,934 cases currently treated (10,644 severe cases), 1770 deaths, 10,844 cases being discharged from hospitals, 7264 suspected cases and 546,016 cases in close contact including 150,539 people being isolated and closely watched. The SARS-CoV-2 is primarily propagated through respiratory droplets and close contact, with the incubation period usually between 1 and 14 days and the typical symptoms after onset of fever, dry cough, fatigue and gradual appearance of dyspnea. People carrying this virus are the source of infection even in the incubation period, and early diagnosis of this disease or carrier of the virus is crucial to preventing it from further spread. However, confirmation of infection of this virus requires presence of the virus nucleic acid detected in swabs, secretions and sputum from the respiratory tract, blood or stools.7 Nonetheless, detection of the virus nucleic acid may not be convenient, and early diagnosis of the NCP is essential for timely isolation and treatment of the patient. Computed tomography (CT) is easily available and can be used to screen patients for rapid confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP because CT, especially high resolution CT, has the advantages of high spatial resolution, freedom of disturbance from other structures outside the scanning plane and ability to display every details of the lesion in multiple planes and directions. This study was performed to analyze the clinical and CT imaging features in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP or COVID-19 and to familiarize radiologists and doctors with the common clinical and CT imaging findings of this disease for quick recognition, rapid isolation and treatment of the patient.",

The lesion density was mostly non-uniform with air bronchogram and thickened interlobular or intralobular septa. In severe or critically severe patients, multiple patches or an integrated larger patch of ground glass opacity, consolidation or mixed consolidation and ground glass opacity might present in bilateral lungs, with these three imaging manifestations being possibly presented in one patient at the same time. Consolidation and thickened interlobular septa were presented in severe or critically severe patients more than common ones, suggesting progression of the disease. The lesion was mostly located in the peripheral area under the pleura but might extend towards the center in bigger lesions, and peripheral lesions with involvement of the center were mostly seen in severe and critically severe patients. Four to ten days after treatment in this series, repeated CT scanning revealed that most lesions were absorbed and improved with reduced extent, decreased density and formation of fibrotic stripes (Fig. 2\n\u20136\n). In one common patient, the lesion in the right lower lobe was improved four days after treatment, however, a new lesion appeared in the left lower lobe which was improved after treatment for three additional days (Fig. 3). This might indicate that the lesion might change rapidly in a short period of time and repeated CT scanning could provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",
