This, in turn, requires that they have a certain weight, which makes them inconvenient to carry.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Accordingly, numerous techniques have been developed over the past two decades to allow for the isothermal amplification of nucleic acids, including those known as helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), rolling-circle amplification (RCA), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA), and loopmediated amplification (LAMP), among others. [2] These are known as isothermal amplification methods. [3] One especially useful isothermal amplification method is known as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). In RPA, the ability of enzymes involved in the normal homologous recombination processes to accept (as their natural substrate) duplex DNA is coupled with relatively long primers (~30-35 nucleotides) that can be recombined into the target duplex or amplicons from the previous round of amplification. [4] A strand-displacing polymerase then continues the primer extension, to create, after a second cycle, more double-stranded products. These then serve as the starting point for the next cycle of recombination ( Figure 1 ). [4] RPA has been developed and used to detect several viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases, to detect food-borne pathogens, and to screen anti-cancer drugs. [5] RPA can be performed in a real-time PCR machine by using a DNA-binding dye (e.g., SYBR Green or EvaGreen) to detect the increase in the desired product. [6] In principle, formation of the correct amplicon can be validated by performing thermal denaturation studies on the products. In practice, however, RPA invariably forms large amounts of side products that, although normally not analyzed, are called primer-dimers. [4] Additional artifacts, generally not characterized, are also formed, to add to the background signal. [7] This is a common problem with isothermal amplification procedures, because the system Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal method to amplify nucleic acid sequences without the temperature cycling that classical PCR uses. Instead of using heat to denature the DNA duplex, RPA uses recombination enzymes to swap single-stranded primers into the duplex DNA product; these are then extended using a strand-displacing polymerase to complete the cycle. Because RPA runs at low temperatures, it never forces the system to recreate base-pairs following Watson-Crick rules, and therefore it produces undesired prod-ucts that impede the amplification of the desired product, complicating downstream analysis. Herein, we show that most of these undesired side products can be avoided if the primers contain components of a self-avoiding molecular recognition system (SAMRS). Given the precision that is necessary in the recombination systems for them to function biologically, it is surprising that they accept SAMRS. SAMRS-RPA is expected to be a powerful tool within the range of amplification techniques available to scientists. is not forced (at any point in the cycle) to reform the Watson-Crick base-pairs by slowly annealing from high to low temperatures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 347, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 816, "end": 819, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1044, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1205, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1362, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1629, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1734, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1029, "end": 1037, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Recently, we reported the unexpected discovery that several high temperature (but not ultrahigh temperature) DNA polymerases could support standard PCR amplification by using primers that contained components of a self-avoiding molecular recognition system (SAMRS). [8] In a SAMRS oligonucleotide, A, T, G, and C nucleobases are substituted at some (but not necessarily all) sites. [9] In these oligonucleotides, the hydrogen-bonding units are strategically substituted with four replacement nucleotides (A*, T*, G*, and C*, Figure 2 ). SAMRS A* pairs with natural T, SAMRS T* pairs with natural A, SAMRS G* pairs with natural C, and SAMRS C* pairs with natural G. However, A*:T* and C*:G* base-pairs do not contribute to the stability of the helix, because they either form one or 1.5 bonds ( Figure 2 ). This means that oligonucleotides built from SAMRS components do not interact with each other, no matter what their concentration, which allows them to bind solely to their intended targets. Indeed, in a variety of standard PCR methods, we found that by placing SAMRS nucleotides in the 3'-end of PCR primers, primer-dimers could mostly be avoided. [8] [9] This was true even when the primers were extremely poorly designed. For example, Hoshika et al. demonstrated how SAMRS components could prevent primerdimer formation even when the 3'-sequences of the primers form perfect formal matches in a 9 base-pair duplex. [8] These results prompted us to ask whether SAMRS components, when added to the primers at their 3'-ends, would support RPA more broadly than primers composed only of natural nucleotides, and avoid the off-target interactions that make RPA difficult to detect by fluorescent dye binding. In particular, because SAMRS:standard base-pairs are joined by only two hydrogen bonds, their contribution to duplex stability is similar to the weaker natural A:T base-pair, and we were concerned that this would prevent RPA from working with SAMRS-containing primers. Furthermore, enzymes for recombination have evolved for billions of years to be highly specific for DNA; these general considerations predict that recombinases might not accept structurally altered nucleotides. Herein, we report data showing that SAMRS is compatible with RPA and reverse transcriptase RPA (RT-RPA).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1157, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1161, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1426, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 525, "end": 533, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 794, "end": 802, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this implementation of the SAMRS concept, the SAMRS adenine analogue A* was chosen to be 2-aminopurine, the SAMRS guanine analogue G* was hypoxanthine, the SAMRS thymine analogue T* was 2-thiothymine, and the SAMRS cytosine analogue C* was N 4 -ethylcytosine ( Figure 2 ).

A complex of primers (wavy lines) and DNA recombinase enzymes (rec) scans the doublestranded DNA template for complimentary sequences. Single-strand binding proteins (ssb) displace the complimentary strands and allow the polymerase (pol) to extend the primers and generate another copy of the template, which eventually results in an exponential amplification of the template DNA.

Therefore, we found in practice it is best not to place SAMRS components at all sites in a primer. Rather, we recommend that SAMRS nucleotides be placed near the 3'-ends of the primers, generally at sites n\u00c01, n\u00c02, n\u00c03, and n\u00c04, where n is the 3'-terminal (last) site of the oligonucleotide primer.

These artifacts interfere with the desired amplification through the unproductive consumption of primers (tying up the resources of the assay), which produces duplexes that are also stained by the DNA dyes and impedes the amplification of the preferred product.

In these reactions, varying concentrations of the influenza A DNA template was used with STD or SAMRS primers. As shown in Figure 3 B, real-time amplification with STD primers resulted in a nonspecific signal. The noise arising from this nonspecific signal made it difficult to identify a signal that correlated with the amount of target DNA added (Figure 3 B) .

The amplification detection threshold (C p ) depends linearly on the copy number of the input template when SAMRS primers were used (insets , Figures 3 B,C) . Thus, by allowing for a simpler detection method and avoiding the need for gel electrophoresis, SAMRS primers simplified the assay. This means that SAMRS primers improve RPA as an amplification method and are potentially useful for point-of-care and low-resourceenvironment applications.
