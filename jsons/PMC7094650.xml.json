In cases progressing to FIP, which may have a time lag of weeks to years, viral and host factors combine to turn an initial, usually subclinical, enteritis into an overt immune-mediated disease (Pedersen et al., 1981, Kipar and Meli, 2014). Much research has focussed on viral mutations and has partially elucidated the function of various viral proteins in the pathogenesis of FIP. The viral spike (S) protein gene has been of particular interest, and a switch from methionine (M) to leucine (L) at amino acid residue 1,058 (M1058L) has been strongly associated with a gain of virulence (Chang et al., 2012). A second switch from serine (S) to alanine (A) at amino acid residue 1,060 (S1060A) distinguished tissue-associated FCoV in a further small subset of FIP cases from FCoV shed with the faeces by healthy cats (Chang et al., 2012). These mutations have since been associated with systemic spread of FCoV, rather than providing proof of virulence (Porter et al., 2014, Barker et al., 2017, Felten et al., 2017a), so the two forms are subsequently referred to here as \u2018systemic\u2019 and \u2018enteric\u2019 FCoV.",

            "text": "Early experiments demonstrated that not all cats are susceptible to FCoV infection, even with known pathogenic strains (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980), indicating the importance of host genetic factors/immune mechanisms in disease development. More recently it was shown that cultured monocytes from different cats vary in their ability to sustain viral replication, again suggesting that there is a subset of animals who can resist disease (Dewerchin et al., 2005, Tekes et al., 2010). Monocytes/macrophages are not the only cell type beyond enterocytes that may be infected by FCoV, but they are also key cells in the innate immune defence system. They are able to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), triggering a number of intracellular signalling pathways leading to activation of an antiviral state in the host (Abbas et al., 2017). Chief amongst these pathways are those triggered by engagement of toll-like receptors (TLRs); highly evolutionarily conserved, membrane-bound pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) (Lester and Li, 2014). Their presence on both the cell surface membrane and internal membrane-bound vesicles allows detection of external and internal PAMPs; their ligands include those associated with viruses, bacteria and fungi (Arpaia and Barton, 2011). Downstream mediators include inflammatory cytokines and interferons that have been assessed in cats with FIP, with sometimes conflicting results (Dean et al., 2003, Kipar et al., 2006b). Interferons and the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 can activate members of the signal transducer and regulator of transcription (STAT) family with downstream effects on replication, differentiation or inflammatory potential (Aaronson and Horvath, 2002). Cats with a compromised immune system appear to be more susceptible to FIP, while, paradoxically, the lesions are caused by an excessive immune response (Pedersen, 1987, Pedersen, 2014, Kipar and Meli, 2014). This has been attributed, at least in part, to increased viral replication in immunosuppressed animals and, therefore, an increased likelihood of viral mutations occurring and accumulating (Poland et al., 1996).",

We therefore chose the MLN as our organ of interest, with the aim of comparing key mediators of the innate immune system between uninfected cats and FCoV-infected cats with and without FIP. We hypothesized that in addition to an excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine response, there would be a deficient interferon response, and aimed to gain an insight into which TLR pathways are involved in triggering this response. We also wished to further evaluate the presence and significance of previously published viral S gene variations and determine whether a connection with the host immune response could be detected.",

Investigating this further, we found that TLR3 gene expression levels in G2 MLNs without lesions were also slightly higher than levels in G1 (which were similar to those in G2 MLNs with lesions), suggesting a potential negative regulation of TLR3 by FCoV (Fig. 3).",

Here we have assessed some of the key mediators of the innate immune response, focussing on the MLN, the most likely first site of infection beyond the intestine and one of the main sites of viral persistence in experimentally infected healthy animals (Kipar et al., 2010). By comparing FCoV-positive, lesion-free MLNs from cats affected by diseases other than FIP with both FCoV-negative cats without FIP and cats with FIP, we aimed to separate the direct viral effects from the host effects contributing to FIP in a natural setting.",

This was reflected by variation in organ involvement and presence of effusions in our case cohort. We therefore also wanted to assess whether the inflammatory mediator production in the MLNs showed any correlation with the form of disease. Although vascular permeability is, to a large extent, cytokine mediated (Takano et al., 2011), and we found upregulation of cytokine genes with a role in vascular permeability in the FIP cases, the inflammatory mediator gene expression profile of the MLNs differed only minimally between cats with and without effusions. This suggests that the MLN is unlikely to make a large systemic contribution to vascular permeability. Similarly, Safi et al. (2017) evaluated inflammatory mediators within peripheral blood mononuclear cells of FIP cats with and without effusions and found little consistent pattern to distinguish those with effusions from those without. Both studies therefore provide further, although indirect, support that vascular endothelial growth factor, which was previously shown to correlate with the degree of effusion in FIP, is key to this phenomenon (Takano et al., 2011). Interestingly, the presence or absence of histological FIP lesions was not correlated with many significant differences between mediator gene expression. Alongside this, and surprisingly, although FCoV levels appeared higher in association with lesions, they were not significantly so. This may partly explain the lack of significant differences in mediator gene expression. Additionally, it cannot be entirely excluded that the area of the MLN sampled for RNA extraction was not within an FIP lesion and vice versa. An alternative explanation for the lack of significant differences between gene expression for most mediators in MLNs, while many exhibit higher overall levels in FIP, would be that systemic stimulation to upregulate inflammatory mediators is more relevant than local or lesion-specific stimulation. Finally, as trends were occasionally observed when cases with and without effusions and MLN lesions were compared, the lack of significance may also be due to the small group sizes once subgroups were created, which was a limitation of this study.",

This confirms previous findings in natural infection, where cats with FIP were reported to carry higher viral loads in haemopoietic and lymphoid tissues, including MLNs, than asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats (Kipar et al., 2006a). Without the disease, however, the presence or absence of FCoV in the MLN seems not to influence the transcription level of most of our target immune mediators. This would indicate that, in the main, the host response has a greater influence than any direct viral effect. Still, there were exceptions. Even among those mediators not attaining significance, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 showed a trend towards higher gene expression levels in FCoV-positive MLNs. This suggests at least a modest direct viral effect; it may have been masked by low group numbers, requiring a larger sample size to confirm or refute. Another study limitation was the composition of the groups. As all were field cases it was not possible to control for confounding factors (e.g. ensuring control cases were free of any inflammatory processes, that FIP cases were at similar disease stages, and that cats were initially subject to the same FCoV infection pressures).",

            "text": "Inflammatory cytokines have been previously studied in FIP, with conflicting results, possibly dependent on variations in disease form between animals included in the different studies and/or the type of sample/organ evaluated. TNF-\u03b1 gene transcription, for example, was found to be decreased in the MLNs of cats with FIP compared with FCoV-free specific pathogen-free cats, while IL-1\u03b2 gene expression was elevated (Kipar et al., 2006b). In the present study, gene expression for all three pyrogenic cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) was upregulated in the MLNs in FIP, as well as that for IL-15 (a stimulator of lymphocyte proliferation). We also found significantly higher transcription levels for the monocyte-recruiting chemokines CXCL10 and CCL8, which have both been found to be upregulated in Crandell\u2013Rees feline kidney cells after in vitro FCoV infection (Harun et al., 2013), indicating a mechanism of monocyte recruitment as a direct viral effect. Our results confirm their relevance in vivo, with recruitment of monocytes as the infected cell type being a potential amplifying step that is worthy of further investigation. The increase in inflammatory cytokine gene transcription supports the observation that an overexuberant inflammatory response is a key factor in the development and progression of FIP. Expression of the gene encoding the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was, in contrast, not upregulated in FIP, implying there was no local brake on the inflammatory process. This is in line with previous findings, where IL-10 expression was higher in the spleen of healthy FCoV-infected cats, but not in the MLN (Kipar et al., 2006b). Gene expression for the interferons was also higher in FIP, IFN-\u03b3 being one of the cytokines to show an intermediate level in infected asymptomatic cats in our study. These type I and II interferons have major antiviral roles in the innate immune system. IFN-\u03b3 in particular has been of interest in FIP, as levels of this potentially protective cytokine tend to be low in the peripheral blood of diseased animals and host gene polymorphisms have been identified that may contribute to resistance against the disease (Gelain et al., 2006, Hsieh and Chueh, 2014). Similarly to the apparent lack of impact of mediator levels on the presence of lesions or effusions in FIP, this suggests that MLN IFN production has a more local effect.",

Here we identified increased gene expression levels of TLRs 2, 4, 8 and 9 with FIP and FCoV infection, respectively, indicating a possible role for these molecules in FIP and hence identifying them as potential targets for FIP control. Assessment at the protein level would be a useful avenue for further investigations; however, this is particularly challenging in feline studies owing to the lack of availability of appropriate antibodies. In most mammals, TLRs 2 and 4 are located on the cell membranes, while TLRs 8 and 9 are found in intracytoplasmic vesicles, most commonly in professional antigen presenting cells (Lester and Li, 2014). TLR2, together with TLRs 1, 6 and 10, comprise the TLR1 family (Roach et al., 2005). These latter three receptors arose through evolutionary gene duplication (Hughes and Piontkivska, 2008, Hennessy et al., 2010). TLR2 is able to signal as a heterodimer with any of its co-family members in order to allow a wider range of antigen recognition. It is typically responsible for detecting bacterial and fungal components (Beutler, 2009). TLR2 has been linked to detection of the SARS-CoV S protein in vitro (Dosch et al., 2009); its upregulation in FIP could indicate that the FCoV S protein is also able to act as a ligand.",

Considering that a previous in vitro study found reduced viral replication when TLR9 was stimulated with a synthetic CpG ligand prior to FCoV infection (Robert-Tissot et al., 2012), the increased gene expression in FCoV-infected cats without FIP could indicate that TLR9 has a protective effect, which may even have helped prevent the development of disease. Stimulation by co-infectious agents could therefore also be hypothesized to be protective against FIP. Along these lines, co-infection must also be considered a possible alternative explanation for the raised TLR2 and 4 gene expression levels, as these TLRs are more typically associated with bacterial infections. Enteric coronavirus infection or the generalized inflammatory state induced by FIP may have increased the permeability of the intestinal barrier to microorganisms. The resulting TLR stimulation would therefore not be virus induced. A third alternative is the upregulation of TLR2 and 4 by endogenous ligand stimulation, reported as a response to alarmin release from damaged cells (van Beijnum et al., 2008). This alternative also fits with upregulation of TLR2 gene expression in lesional MLNs compared with non-lesional MLNs in FIP.",

That no upregulation occurs for TLR3 and TLR7 with FIP suggests either the lack of an appropriate trigger (TLR7 and 8 are known to show differing, if overlapping, specificity, and dsRNA intermediate replicates are a minority of the viral RNA present; Jensen and Thomsen, 2012), or that the virus is able to inhibit TLR transcription. SARS-CoV is known to inhibit both TLR3 and 7 signalling via papain-like protease activity (PLpro) (Li et al., 2016). This mechanism may also contribute in FCoV infection, but would be expected to affect the signalling pathways rather than the TLR mRNA levels directly. In cats with FIP, we observed slightly lower TLR3 gene transcription in MLNs with typical FIP lesions, as compared with MLNs without lesions, down to the levels seen in MLNs from cats without FIP. This could indicate a general systemic stimulus to upregulate TLR3 in FIP, which is counteracted locally by viral inhibition of TLR3. Prior stimulation of TLR3 has also been shown in vitro to contribute to defence against murine coronavirus via type I interferon induction (Mazaleuskaya et al., 2012), so is another potential avenue for future FIP research. A larger sample population, in particular with larger numbers of systemically infected cats without FIP, might have revealed significant intergroup differences for TLR3.",

STAT1 and 2 gene transcription levels correlated with type II and I interferon transcription levels, respectively, in our study, while in virus-positive MLNs of cats without FIP, STAT1 and 2 levels (the latter significantly so), as well as IFN-\u03b3 levels, lay between the other two groups. This shows that the levels of IFNs and their downstream transcription factors are closely linked. Interestingly, STAT2 gene expression levels were significantly higher in the MLNs of cats with FIP and with effusions, a finding that cannot be readily explained. STAT2 has been linked to IL-6 upregulation, which itself has been linked to increased vascular permeability (Maruo et al., 1992, Nan et al., 2018); however, the IL-6 gene was not upregulated in our cohort, suggesting that responsibility lies with another pathway.",

This indicates that further host and/or viral factors are required for the development of FIP or, more precisely, the activation of virus-infected monocytes as a prerequisite to set off FIP vasculitis (Kipar and Meli, 2014). Most likely owing to the low viral RNA levels within the MLNs of cats without FIP, obtaining an adequate sequence from this group proved problematic. Other researchers experienced similar problems, often finding that FCoV RT-PCR-positive samples from cats without FIP were not amenable to sequencing (Felten et al., 2017b). The lack of FCoV antigen expression in these cats was not unexpected and reflects the rarity of infected cells and/or the low virus load in infected cells; this is in line with the results of a previous study that found only rare positive macrophages in the MLNs of experimentally persistently-infected cats (Kipar et al., 2010).",

These cats may have remained carriers or have been demonstrating a transitional phase to later development of disease. However, based on our observations, activation of genes encoding TLRs 2, 4 and 8 in MLNs is associated with a negative outcome (i.e. FIP), while carrier animals upregulated the gene encoding TLR9. IFN-\u03b3, and particularly STAT2 with its myriad opportunities to direct cell fate, displayed intermediate levels of upregulation in the MLNs of the carrier/transitional group, not associated with a widespread increase in mediators of inflammation.",
