            "text": "Plus-stranded RNA viruses, the largest group among eukaryotic viruses, are capable of reprogramming host cells by subverting host proteins and membranes, by co-opting and modulating protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes, and by altering cellular pathways during infection. To achieve robust replication, plus-stranded RNA viruses interact with numerous cellular molecules via proteinprotein, RNA-protein, and protein-lipid interactions using molecular mimicry and other means. These interactions lead to the transformation of the host cells into viral \"factories\" that can produce 10,000-1,000,000 progeny RNAs per infected cell. This chapter presents the progress that was made largely in the last 15 years in understanding virus-host interactions during RNA virus replication. The most commonly employed approaches to identify host factors that affect plus-stranded RNA virus replication are described. In addition, we discuss many of the identified host factors and their proposed roles in RNA virus replication. Altogether, host factors are key determinants of the host range of a given virus and affect virus pathology, host-virus interactions, as well as virus evolution. Studies on host factors also contribute insights into their normal cellular functions, thus promoting understanding of the basic biology of the host cell. The knowledge obtained in this fast-progressing area will likely stimulate the development of new antiviral methods as well as novel strategies that could make plus-stranded RNA viruses useful in bio-and nanotechnology.",

            "text": "Plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses replicate their genomes by manipulating host cells and transforming them into viral \"factories.\" Unraveling the interactions between viruses and their host cells as a function of time can contribute greatly to our understanding of the dynamics of viral infections. (+)RNA viruses replicate their genomes in a two-step process: through the production of minus-strand replication intermediates, followed by the production of (+)RNA progeny via the use of the (-)RNA template. Interestingly, replication is an asymmetric process leading to a 20-to 100-fold excess of the new (+)RNA progeny. All known (+)RNA viruses assemble their own replicase complexes (RCs), likely containing both viral-and host-coded proteins (Ahlquist, 2002; Ahlquist et al., 2003; Buck, 1996; Nagy and Pogany, 2006; Shi and Lai, 2005; Strauss and Strauss, 1999) . In addition, replication takes place in membraneous compartments derived from intracellular organelles, such as the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), mitochondrion, vacuole, Golgi, chloroplast, and peroxisome (Salonen et al., 2005) . Some viruses actively induce the formation of novel cytoplasmic vesicular compartments, using COPII-coated or possibly autophagosomal membranes (Cherry et al., 2006; Egger and Bienz, 2005; Kirkegaard and Jackson, 2005; Rust et al., 2001) . Thus, replication of (+)RNA viruses is a complex process that involves numerous interactions among viral RNA, viral-coded, and host-coded proteins and host membranes (lipids). Dissecting the functions of the various replication-associated or replicationmodulating molecules in (+)RNA replication is one of the major frontiers in current virus research. The picture emerging is that the mechanism of genome replication, and the functions of viral and host factors, might be somewhat analogous among various (+)RNA viruses in spite of their diverse genome organizations and gene expression strategies. Also, most of the previously identified host factors are conserved genes, suggesting that (+)RNA viruses might selectively target conserved host functions as opposed to species-specific factors. Such a strategy would help viruses broaden their host range by expanding infections to new host species. Altogether, host factors play crucial roles in all steps of (+)RNA replication. Host factors are also key determinants of the host range of a given virus and affect virus pathology, host-virus interactions, as well as the evolution of the virus. Host factors could also be potent antiviral targets. Studies on host factors also contribute insights into their normal cellular functions, thus promoting understanding of the basic biology of the host cell.",

            "text": "Possibly, the most powerful means to identify host factors involved in (+)RNA replication are based on genome-wide approaches. Intensive (high-throughput) screens include systematic analysis of most genes available in the genome of a particular host. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is particularly useful for this approach since it has a small genome-size (\u223c5,800 genes) and a reduced level of redundancy among host genes. In addition, yeast is the best-known model for eukaryotic cell with the highest percentage of characterized genes in the genome useful to study the aspects of virus-cell interactions. Also, the genome-wide screens can be performed with single-gene deletion (YKO) and the essential gene (yTHC) libraries of yeast. For this strategy to succeed, it is necessary to launch (+)RNA virus replication in yeast, usually based on plasmid-driven expression of viral RNA/proteins. Yeast as a host for Brome mosaic virus (BMV) was pioneered by the Ahlquist laboratory, and subsequently was adapted for studying replication of Flock house virus (FHV) and tombusviruses of plants, such as Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (Ishikawa et al., 1997b; Janda and Ahlquist, 1993; Panavas and Nagy, 2003; Panaviene et al., 2004; Pantaleo et al., 2003; Price et al., 2000) . The genome-wide screens of 80% of yeast genes with BMV and 95% of yeast genes with TBSV led to the identification of over 100 yeast genes for both viruses that affected their replication Kushner et al., 2003; Panavas et al., 2005b) . Interestingly, only a small set of yeast genes for BMV and TBSV overlapped, suggesting that these distantly related (+)RNA viruses use and/or are being affected by mostly different set of host genes for their replication Panavas et al., 2005b) . Genome-wide screens with the yeast libraries have also been performed to identify host factors affecting RNA recombination in the case of TBSV, further illustrating the usefulness of this approach Serviene et al., 2006 Serviene et al., , 2005 .",

            "text": "Due to the large number of studies using YTH screens, we cannot cover the entire area. Instead, we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by discussing findings with HCV and poliovirus (PV). For example, NS5A of HCV was screened against an interferon-induced human hepatocyte cDNA library, leading to the discovery of the 33kDa human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (hVAP-A, also called hVAP-33) (Tu et al., 1999) . hVAP-A also interacts with NS5B of HCV (Tu et al., 1999) . Another YTH screen with the HCV NS5A, using human brain and liver cDNA libraries, led to the identification of the immunophilin, termed FKBP8, which is a human FK506-binding protein (Okamoto et al., 2006) . When the NS5B RdRp protein was used as a bait, p68 helicase was identified as an interactor from a human spleen cDNA library (Goh et al., 2004) . A screen with the HCV NS5B, using a human liver cDNA library, led to the identification of eIF4AII (a DEAD box RNA helicase) that partially co-localized with NS5B in infected cells (Kyono et al., 2002) . Another YTH screen with the HCV NS5B protein, using a human hepatocyte cDNA library, led to the identification of ubiquitin-like protein hPLIC1, which functionally connects the ubiquitination machinery to the proteosome and could be involved in regulation of NS5B stability and HCV replication (Gao et al., 2003) . Using a human thymus cDNA library against HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as a bait, Kim et al. identified eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (isoform 2, named eIF4AII) and septin 6, a GTP-binding protein involved in membrane dynamics, trafficking and cytoskeletal remodeling (Kim et al., 2007) . Depletion of septin 6 by RNAi decreased HCV replication, suggesting that septin 6 is a necessary host factor for HCV (Kim et al., 2007) . In the case of PV, Kirkegaard et al. found that Sam68 (Src-associated in mitosis, 68kDa) interacted with the 3D RdRp protein, which resulted in re-localization of Sam68 to PV-induced cytoplasmic vesicles/membranes, the site of PV replication (McBride et al., 1996) .",

Using the untranslated regions (UTRs) of a coronavirus RNA for UV-crosslinking, Lai, Leibowitz, Hogue, and their colleagues identified numerous RNA-binding host proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), and mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase) (Li et al., 1997; Nanda and Leibowitz, 2001; Shi and Lai, 2005; Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000) . Also, the hnRNP-C that interacts with the (-)RNA of PV has been identified (Brunner et al., 2005; Roehl and Semler, 1995) . Using West Nile virus (WNV) (+) and (-)RNAs, Brinton et al. identified several host proteins that were specifically UV-crosslinked to the viral RNA (Li et al., 2002) . These cellular proteins included T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1), TIA-1-related protein (TIAR), and eEF1A. In the case of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus related to HCV, various portions of the BVDV genomic (g)RNA were used in UV-crosslinking experiments with bovine and human cellular extracts (Isken et al., 2003) . This work led to the identification of three RNA-binding proteins, named NF90 (nuclear factor 90, also called NFAR-1), NF45, and RNA helicase A (RHA), which are RNA-binding proteins containing double-stranded RNA-binding motifs.",

            "text": "The genome-wide screens with BMV, TBSV, and DCV confirmed that (+)RNA viruses depend greatly on the intracellular components of infected hosts for robust viral replication. It appears that the interactions between host cells and (+)RNA viruses are complex, likely including numerous replication-associated host factors with direct or indirect roles. Overall, the identified host factors likely belong to one of the following three groups. (i) Those that may directly interact with the viral RNA(s) or replication proteins and perform essential functions for the virus. This group of host factors also include host membranes/lipids, various components of the intracellular transport and trafficking system, the translation apparatus, and possibly intracellular compartments, such as the ER, peroxisome, and vesicles, which (+)RNA viruses require and/or utilize to complete their replication. For example, the Hsp70 molecular chaperone, which is present in the tombusviral RC, might be directly involved in replicase assembly (Serva and Nagy, 2006) . (ii) Those host factors that indirectly affect (+)RNA virus replication via influencing the amount and/or activity of those host factors, which are directly involved [group (i) above]. These indirect host factors may affect the competition between the virus and the host for limited cellular resources, host proteins, and intracellular compartments. For example, transcription factors could affect the amount of host factors available in the infected cells, thus indirectly affecting (+)RNA virus replication. (iii) The third group of host factors includes direct inhibitory factors, such as components of the host innate and general antiviral defense mechanisms, which affect virus replication by destroying/modifying viral RNAs or viral replication proteins in targeted or in general manners. For example, Ngl2p endoribonuclease, the yeast Xrn1p, and the Arabidopsis Xrn4p 5'-3' exoribonucleases were found to affect degradation, and thus stability, of TBSV RNA (Cheng et al., 2007 Serviene et al., 2005) . The second and third groups of host factors will not be discussed further in this chapter.",

However, unlike host mRNAs, the viral (+)RNA has to be recruited for replication and saved from RNA degradation. Both host-and viral-coded proteins have been documented to participate in the regulation of the switch from translation to replication. Translation of the replication proteins and the selection of the viral gRNA for replication likely takes place in the cytoplasm, whereas replication of (+)RNA viruses occurs on the cytoplasmic faces of various organelle-derived membrane surfaces Buck, 1996; Salonen et al., 2005) . Therefore, the viral gRNA, together with viral and host factors, must be transported/recruited to the site of replication.

            "text": "The recently emerging picture is that viral replication proteins can bind selectively to viral (+)RNA, which likely leads to selection/recruitment of the viral RNA The RC is shown schematically, but the RC likely contains more protein components. The red coloring for the RdRp suggests that the RdRp is inactive (replication incompetent) at the beginning, while it gets activated (shown in green color) during the replicase assembly process, possibly with the help of host factors and the viral (+)RNA. Viral-coded auxiliary replication proteins are shown as black circles, whereas they are shown as pink circles after their putative inactivation, possibly via phosphorylation. The entire RC may become inactivated by phosphorylation and/or ubiquitinaton prior to disassembly. Red line indicates plus-stranded, while blue line shows the minus-stranded viral RNAs. Small circles show the subcellular membraneous compartment used for replication. RdRp is the viral-coded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, whereas HF stands for a host factor. from translation into replication. This has been shown for the 1a protein of BMV, the p33 replication protein in tombusviruses, the 126K protein of TMV, and the 3CD protein of PV (Gamarnik and Andino, 2000; Osman and Buck, 2003; Pogany et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005b) . In the case of TBSV, highly specific binding of the p33 replication protein to a conserved sequence forming a long hairpin structure with an internal C\u2022C mismatch in the TBSV gRNA (termed the p33 recognition element, p33RE) is essential for TBSV RNA replication in yeast or virus replication in plants (Monkewich et al., 2005; Pogany et al., 2005) . Additional in vitro and in vivo data firmly support the role of the p33:p33RE interaction as the major factor in selection of TBSV RNA for replication from the diverse RNA pool present in the host cell. Interestingly, the selection of viral RNA templates for replication is mechanistically similar to viral RNA encapsidation, which is also based on the requirement of a specialized viral protein, the coat protein, leading to packaging of the viral RNA into virions that are mostly inaccessible for other processes.",

For example, recruitment of BMV RNAs for replication is affected by Lsm1p, which belongs to the seven member Sm-like family of proteins (Diez et al., 2000; . Lsm1p, together with Lsm2-7p, form the Lsm1p-7p heptameric ring, which is involved in mRNA turnover. Diez et al. found that Lsm1p-7p, which together with Pat1p and Dhh1p, is called the decapping activator complex, that moves cellular mRNAs from translation to degradation in the cytoplasmic processing bodies (termed P-bodies), and that might function as a key regulator to switch BMV RNAs from translation to replication (Mas et al., 2006) . According to this model, the Lsm1p-7p/Pat1p/Dhh1p complex could refold the BMV RNAs allowing separation from ribosomes and translation factors and the binding of the BMV 1a replication protein to viral RNA. Then, the viral (+)RNA, likely in association with the replication proteins and host factors, ends up in the Pbody that may serve as a place to pre-assemble the BMV RC prior to transport to the ER, where maturation likely occurs on the membranes (the site of BMV replication) (Beckham et al., 2007) .",

Based on this model, the fulllength PCBP-2 can bind to stem-loop 4, which is part of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), in PV RNA as well as to the host protein SRp20 (involved in RNA trafficking) to promote the cap-independent translation of the PV RNA. Due to protease activity of the PV-coded 3CD or 3C, PCBP-2 is cleaved proteolytically, removing the KH3 RNA-binding site. The cleaved form of PCBP-2, however, still contains KH1-2 RNA-binding sites and it retains its ability to bind to stem-loop 1 in the PV RNA, which is critical for replication by bringing together the 3 and 5 ends of the PV RNA via interaction with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (Perera et al., 2007; Walter et al., 2002) . PCBP also binds to the spacer sequence located between the cloverleaf and the IRES, which is required for the replication (Toyoda et al., 2007) . In addition to the cellular proteins, the PV-coded 3CD RdRp precursor regulates RNA template selection and switching of the viral RNA from translation to replication by binding to the coverleaf-like structure at the 5 UTR and affecting genome circularization (Gamarnik and Andino, 2000; Herold and Andino, 2001) . The resulting genome circularization is predicted to be critical for PV minus-strand synthesis Andino, 1998, 2000; Herold and Andino, 2001; Perera et al., 2007) .",

Since PTB was found to bind to the HCV RNA and since it is re-localized to detergent-resistant membrane fractions, the sites of HCV replication, Lai et al. suggested that PTB or its truncated (proteolytically cleaved) versions might facilitate the switch from translation to replication (Aizaki et al., 2006) . In addition, PTB is also critical for HCV RNA synthesis, because antibody-based depletion of PTB inhibited HCV RNA synthesis in a cell-free system and small interfering (si)RNA-based depletion of PTB inhibited HCV accumulation in infected cells (Aizaki et al., 2006; Chang and Luo, 2006) .",

The resulting genome circularization might facilitate RNA replication, as suggested above for PV. An additional hnRNP protein, termed synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP), may also be involved in the switch to replication, via inducing conformational changes in the highly structured coronavirus RNA that could facilitate RNA replication (Choi et al., 2004) . Interestingly, PTB and hnRNP-A1 have also been found to play roles in HCV replication (Aizaki et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007) .

Based on RNA competition studies that included various regions of the (+)RNA genome of BVDV, Behrens et al. proposed that NF90/NF40/RHA bind to both the 3 and the 5 UTRs, leading to circularization of the BVDV (+)RNA (Isken et al., 2003) . This could be the signal to switch from translation to replication. Indeed, RHA has helicase activity that may facilitate the refolding of the viral RNA to make it suitable for replication. Also, NF90/NF40/RHA proteins are part of the antiviral response, thus their recruitment for BVDV replication in the cytoplasm can weaken the antiviral response that takes place in the nucleus. The NF90/NF40/RHA proteins together with NF110, might also promote the circularization of HCV (+)RNA via facilitating the interaction between the 5 UTR and the 3 UTR. Moreover, these proteins are re-localized to the site of HCV replication, suggesting that their roles could be similar in HCV as in BVDV RNA replication (Isken et al., 2007) .",

Therefore, the viral (+)RNA and the viral-coded replication proteins must be targeted to those subcellular compartments (Fig. 14.1, step 2) . The viral gRNA is likely recruited in cis by the newly produced replication proteins, which could bind to the gRNA present in the same location (cis-binding) (Neeleman and Bol, 1999; Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994; Oster et al., 1998; Panaviene et al., 2003; Vlot et al., 2003; Weiland and Dreher, 1993) during natural infections. Altogether, recruitment in cis may be a more efficient process than recruitment in trans that could secure the effective transportation of the limited amount of viral gRNA to the site of replication. The picture emerging from recent studies with several (+)RNA viruses is that both viral-and host-coded proteins participate in the intracellular targeting/transport step.",

The interactions may be important for the association of these viral replication proteins with intracellular membranes, the site of HCV replication, due to hVAP-A serving as a membrane receptor. Also, a geranylgeranylated cellular protein, named FBL2, might be involved in the recruitment of the HCV NS5A replication protein to the intracellular membranes. The interaction between the geranylgeranylated FBL2 and the HCV NS5A is essential for HCV replication, based on depletion of FBL2 by RNAi and the expression of the dominant negative mutant of FBL2 that both led to inhibition of HCV accumulation (Wang et al., 2005a) .",

These compartments (virosomes) contain the membrane-bound viral RC, which is the key enzyme in (+)RNA replication. The RC has to perform many functions during replication, including recognition of minusand plus-strand initiation promoters located at the 3' terminus of (+) or (-)RNA, de novo (primer-independent) or primer-dependent initiation, as well as the synthesis of complementary RNA strands, strand separation, and the repair of viral RNAs with damaged termini (Dreher, 1999; Kao et al., 2001; Rao et al., 1989) . In addition, the viral RC has to recognize additional regulatory RNA elements, such as any replication silencer or replication enhancer, which either down-or up-regulate RNA synthesis (Nagy and Pogany, 2006) . Also, the viral RC is involved in the production of sgRNAs in some viruses (Buck, 1996 (Buck, , 1999 White, 2002) . Moreover, the activity of the RC leads to genetic mutations and RNA recombination via template-switching during RNA synthesis, which affects RNA virus evolution (Cheng and Nagy, 2003; Kim and Kao, 2001; Nagy et al., 1995; Nagyet al., 1998; Roossinck, 2003; Wierzchoslawski and Bujarski, 2006) . Although it is currently unknown how the viral RC can perform so many activities, it is possible that the multi-functionality is due to the elaborate composition of the viral RC.",

Electron microscopy (EM) and immuno-EM images of the sites of BMV replication, containing the active viral RC, revealed that the sites of BMV replication consist of 50-60nm spherule-like structures with cellular membranes surrounding the replication proteins and the viral RNA (Schwartz et al., 2002) . Interestingly, individual spherules contain small openings (membraneous necks), which likely serve as gates for transportation of molecules between the spherules and the cytoplasm (Schwartz et al., 2002) . In a broad sense, we can regard one separate spherule as one active/matured RC. Studies on the molecular composition of a single spherule based on immuno-labeled images revealed that one spherule could contain 25-fold more 1a replication protein than 2a pol , whereas the actual number and nature of host molecules within single spherules are currently unknown. Current models predict that highly organized protein:protein and protein:RNA complexes, with the help of cellular membranes, facilitate the formation of an active (+)RNA virus RC.",

These include both viral and host factors that likely contribute to replicase assembly. For example, cellular chaperones may play essential roles in the assembly of viral replicases. The documented cases include Ydj1p, J-domain protein of the Hsp40 chaperone family that was found to affect minus-strand synthesis of BMV in yeast, but not the 1a-mediated recruitment of viral RNA or 2a pol to the site of replication (Tomita et al., 2003) . Also, Ydj1p affected the amount of 2a pol present as a soluble protein and a reduced amount of Ydj1p in yeast led to aggregation of a fraction of 2a pol . Based on these data and the known property of Ydj1p, Ahlquist and co-authors proposed that Ydj1p is involved in the assembly and/or activation of the BMV RC prior to minus-strand synthesis (Tomita et al., 2003) . Serva and Nagy proposed a similar function for the Hsp70 proteins (termed Ssa1p and Ssa2p in yeast) in folding/activation of tombusvirus RC (Serva and Nagy, 2006) . Indeed, deletion of SSA1/2 led to fourfold decrease in TBSV replication in yeast and reduced the amount of the replication proteins, suggesting that Hsp70 might stabilize the replication proteins. Also, Ssa1/2p were found to bind to the p33 replication protein and be present within the highly purified tombusvirus RC (Serva and Nagy, 2006) .",

The formation of the vesicular compartment by DCV depends on the COPI host protein (Cherry et al., 2006) . Depletion of COPI via RNAi reduced cytoplasmic vesicles by 2.5-fold, suggesting that the COPI coatomer is critical for the formation of the DCV-induced vesicular compartment. The induction of COPI-based vesicle formation could be regulated by small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1). Indeed, the PV RC recruits Arfs, which, in GTP-bound form (the membrane-associated active form), could recruit other cellular proteins to change membrane curvature, induce transport vesicles from intracellular membrane organelles, and stimulate phospholipase D activity that modifies the lipid composition of membranes . PV 3A has been shown to recruit GBF1, a GEF (guanine exchange factor) to facilitate Arf1-activation/localization to the membrane, whereas the PV-coded 3CD protein binds to BIG1/2 GEFs . Thus, it is likely that PV 3A and 3CD proteins act synergistically to modify the cellular membrane traffic pathway to facilitate the formation of the PV RC . Additional data from Wessels et al. revealed that modulation of the Arf-activating pathway by PV might also lead to inhibition of cellular secretion to ensure survival in the infected animal (Wessels et al., 2006a,b) . Moreover, reticulon 3 cellular protein, which interacts with the 2A protein of several picornaviruses, might also be involved in modulating the assembly of the viral RC (Tang et al., 2007) .",

The cellular hVAP-A, a vesicle membrane transport protein associated with HCV NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B replication proteins, was shown to play a critical role in the assembly of the HCV RC on lipid rafts (Gao et al., 2004) . hVAP-A is partially associated with lipid rafts and dominant negative versions of hVAP-A or RNAi-driven depletion of hVAP-A resulted in relocation of NS5B from detergent-resistant to detergent-sensitive membranes. In addition, the NS5A and hVAP-A interaction is also critical for HCV RC assembly, based on the observation that hypophosphorylated NS5A can interact with hVAP-A, leading to efficient replication, whereas the hyperphosphorylated NS5A cannot interact with hVAP-A resulting in reduced replication (Evans et al., 2004) . More recently, hVAP-B, a ubiquitous VAP-A-like protein, has also been implicated in HCV replication (Hamamoto et al., 2005) . hVAP-B interacts with both NS5A and NS5B of HCV and it is likely part of the HCV RC because specific antibody against VAP-B inhibited HCV replication in vitro. Furthermore, depletion of hVAP-B by RNAi inhibited HCV replication. Unlike overexpression of hVAP-A, the overexpression of hVAP-B enhanced HCV replication, suggesting that hVAP-B is the limiting factor in the formation of the heterodimer between hVAP-A and hVAP-B, which could be the most effective form in facilitating HCV replication (Hamamoto et al., 2005) . Overall, hVAP-A and likely hVAP-B play roles in targeting NS5B to the membrane and the assembly of the RC on lipid rafts (Gao et al., 2004) .",

Wang and Nagy (unpublished) found that the key co-opted host protein for TBSV replication that regulates asymmetrical RNA synthesis is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, or Tdh2/3p in yeast). GAPDH, which is present in the tombusvirus RC (Serva and Nagy, 2006) , is a highly conserved, very abundant protein that is ubiquitous in nature (Sirover, 1999) . GAPDH is a key component of cytosolic energy production, but it also displays many additional cellular activities, including roles in apoptosis, endocytosis, nuclear tRNA transport, vesicular secretory transport, nuclear membrane fusion, modulation of the cytoskeleton, DNA replication and repair, maintenance of telomere structure, and transcriptional control of histone gene expression (Sirover, 1999 (Sirover, , 2005 . GAPDH also binds to various RNAs, such as AU-rich sequences at the 3 terminus of mRNAs, which can lead to stabilization of the RNA in the cell (Bonafe et al., 2005) . Interestingly, down-regulation of GAPDH inhibited TBSV replication in yeast and in plants and resulted in the production of (+) and (-)RNAs in a 1:1 ratio, instead of the hallmark asymmetric RNA synthesis. Thus, the replication of TBSV became double-stranded RNA virus like when only a limiting amount of GAPDH was present in the viral RC. Moreover, GAPDH was relocalized from the cytosol to the peroxisomal membrane surface, the site of TBSV RNA synthesis. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, it has been proposed that GAPDH promotes asymmetric RNA synthesis by selectively retaining the (-)RNA template in the viral RC, thus allowing efficient access of the (-)RNA replication intermediate to the viral RC. On the contrary, (+)RNA progeny, which are not bound by GAPDH, get released from the RC into the cytosol (Wang and Nagy, unpublished) . Thus, a cellular metabolic enzyme can regulate asymmetric viral RNA synthesis, explaining this hallmark feature of (+)RNA viruses.",

In addition to the viral replication proteins, host proteins are also predicted to participate in regulation of sgRNA synthesis. Accordingly, Hardy and his colleagues found that hnRNP-K, a predominantly nuclear poly(C)-binding protein with 3 KH RNA-binding domains, co-precipitated with the SIN sgRNA, but not with the gRNA (Burnham et al., 2007) . hnRNP-K also interacted with SIN nonstructural proteins and it was redistributed to the membrane fraction and co-localized with the SIN RC in infected cells. Interestingly, the amount of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is up-regulated in SIN-infected cells and MAPK-based phosphorylation of hnRNP-K can lead to cytosolic accumulation of hnRNP-K, suggesting that the MAPK pathway could be involved in the re-localization of hnRNP-K for SIN replication. Overall, the interaction of hnRNP-K with the sgRNA and the SIN nonstructural proteins might lead to up-regulation of the sgRNA synthesis that produces \u223cfourfold more sgRNA than gRNA (Burnham et al., 2007) .",

For example, phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in the vicinity of the RNAbinding domain of the TBSV p33 replication protein was shown to reduce RNAbinding capacity of p33 Stork et al., 2005) . If phosphorylation takes place reversibly, then the same RC could release the viral (+)RNA progeny ( Fig. 14.1, step 5) , followed by new rounds of RNA synthesis and release. The cellular kinase involved in phosphorylation of TBSV p33 might be protein kinase-C (PKC) like, based on in vitro experiments. Overall, the above model does not exclude that other processes, such as replicase disassembly might also play a role in viral (+)RNA release.",

A genome-wide screen in yeast identified host genes that could affect the ubiquitination pathway, such as BRE1 and RAD6 (Panavas et al., 2005b) . Thus, ubiquitination of replication proteins may alter the stability of the virus RC. Also, it has been postulated that an unidentified cellular kinase that phosphorylates the HCV NS5A protein could inhibit its interaction with hVAP-33, thus leading to disassembly of the HCV RC (Evans et al., 2004) . Subsequent work identified the human p70S6K and related kinases as the likely candidates for hyperphosphorylation of NS5A (Coito et al., 2004) . Overall, our current knowledge is poor about RC disassembly.",

However, the application of systems biology approaches and the availability of complete sequences for many host genomes, in combination with development of in vitro approaches and yeast as a model host, will likely lead to rapid advances in identification and characterization of host factors involved in (+)RNA virus replication. The combined use of genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology will help dissect the detailed functions of subverted host proteins. Also, proteomics-based analysis of the viral RC is expected to lead to identification of host proteins recruited into (+)RNA virus replication. Determination of 3D structures of viral RdRp and the auxiliary replication proteins with bound RNAs, as well as high resolution imaging of viral RCs, will likely unravel the mechanism and regulation of (+)RNA replication. Proteomics approaches should also accelerate identification of various post-translational modifications of viral and host proteins that could affect and/or regulate their functions during the replication process. These advances will lead to a better understanding of virus replication and host:(+)RNA virus interactions, which are key aspects of viral pathogenesis.",
