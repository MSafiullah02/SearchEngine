Here we describe the methodology of Covasim , an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing, hygiene measures, and protective equipment; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine disease dynamics and policy options in Africa, Europe, Oceania, and North America.",

            "text": "The length of time after exposure before an individual becomes infectious is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of 4.6 days, which is within the range of values reported across the literature (Table 1 ). The length of time between the start of viral shedding and symptom onset is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of 1 day (Table 1) . Exposed individuals may develop symptoms or may remain asymptomatic. Individuals with symptoms are disaggregated into either mild, severe, or critical cases, with the probability of developing a more acute case increasing with age (Table 2) . Covasim can also model the effect of comorbidities, which act by modifying an individual's probability of developing severe symptoms (and hence critical symptoms and death). By default, comorbidity multipliers are set to 1 since they are already factored into the marginal age-dependent disease progression rates. Du et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Pung et al., 2020. i Length of time after viral shedding has begun before an individual has symptoms i ~ lognormal(1,1) report that infectiousness started from 2.3 days (95% CI, 0.8-3.0 days) before symptom onset and peaked at 0.7 days (95% CI, \u22120.2-2.0 days) before symptom onset. Gatto et al. (2020) estimate a pre-symptomatic period of 1.3 days. Age-linked disease susceptibility, progression, and mortality probabilities. Key: p sus : probability of developing symptoms; p sym : probability of developing symptoms; p sev : probability of developing severe symptoms (i.e., sufficient to justify hospitalization); p cri : probability of developing into a critical case (i.e., sufficient to require ICU); p death : probability of death. Susceptibility values are derived from Zhang et al. (2020) ; all other values are derived from Verity et al. (2020) and Ferguson et al. (2020) . *Overall values depend on the age structure of the population being modeled. For a population like the US or UK, the symptomatic proportion is roughly 0.7, while for populations skewed towards younger ages, the symptomatic proportion is lower. ",

As a first approximation to this viral time course, we model two stages of viral load: an early high stage followed by a longer low stage. By default, we set the viral load of the high stage to be twice as high as the low stage and to last for 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each agent is drawn from a log-normal distribution with mean 0.84 and standard deviation 0.30 (Endo et al., 2020) . The daily viral load is used to adjust the per-contact transmission probability ( ) for an agent on a given day (Figure 2 ).",

Whereas compartmental SEIR models require the same amount of computation time regardless of the population size being modeled, the performance of agent-based models typically scales linearly or supralinearly with population size (see Section 2.7.1). As a consequence, many agent-based models, including Covasim, include an optional \"scaling factor\", where a single agent in the model is assumed to represent multiple people in the real world. A scaling factor of 10, for example, corresponds to the assumption that the epidemic dynamics in a city of 2 million people can be considered as the sum of the epidemic dynamics of 10 identical subregions of 200,000 people each.",

Once a certain threshold is reached, however (by default, 5% of the population), the non-susceptible agents in the model are downsampled and a corresponding scaling factor is introduced (by default, a factor of 2 is used). For example, in a simulation of 100,000 agents representing a true population of 1 million, dynamic scaling would be triggered when cumulative infections surpass 5,000, leaving 95,000 susceptible agents; dynamic rescaling would resample the non-susceptible population to 2,500 (representing 5,000 people) and increase the number of susceptible agents to 97,500 (representing 195,000 people), with every agent now counting as two. If the epidemic expands further, this process will repeat iteratively until the scale factor reaches its upper limit (which in this example is 10, and which would be reached after 50,000 cumulative infections).

            "text": "Dynamical models are commonly validated by comparing their projections against data on what actually happened. However, there are several challenges in using this approach for COVID-19, including (a) data quality issues (such as low case detection rates and under-reporting of deaths), (b) the difficulty of predicting future social and political responses that would significantly impact model projections (such as the timing of school and workplace reopening), and (c) the fact that model-based projections themselves have the potential to influence policy decisions, e.g., optimistic model projections may lead to relaxed policies, which in turn will lead to worse outcomes than predicted; pessimistic model projections may lead to stricter policies, which in turn will lead to better outcomes than predicted.",

Increased data availability will also allow the incorporation of more detailed populations and networks, including aged care facilities, healthcare workers, different types of industry, spatial mixing patterns, and the socioeconomic and racial disparities present in both transmission patterns and health outcomes. A second key area of development is increased detail in modeling health system capacity, health system interventions, and treatment outcomes. Future work will also involve expansion to other locations for which sufficient data are available, with emphasis on exploring scenarios for achieving COVID-19 suppression via testing, contact tracing, and quarantine.",
