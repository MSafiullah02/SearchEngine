In this paper we focus on the`human element' and propose a mathematical model to investigate the eects on the COVID19 epidemic of social behavioral changes in response to lockdowns. We consider a SEIRlike epidemic model where that contact and quarantine rates are assumed to depend on the available information and rumors about the disease status in the community. The model is applied to the case of COVID19 epidemic in Italy. We consider the period that stretches between February 24, 2020 when the rst bulletin by the Italian Civil Protection was reported and May 18, 2020 when the lockdown restrictions have been mostly removed. The role played by the informationrelated parameters is determined by evaluating how they aect suitable outbreakseverity indicators. We estimated that citizens compliance with mitigation measures played a decisive role in curbing the epidemic curve by preventing a duplication of deaths and about 46% more contagions.",

            "text": "In December 2019, the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan, China, reported to the World Health Organization a cluster of viral pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province. On January 9, 2020, the China CDC reported that the respiratory disease, later named COVID19, was caused by the novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 [52] . The outbreak of COVID19 rapidly expanded from Hubei province to the rest of China and then to other countries. Finally, it developed in a devastating pandemics aecting almost all the countries of the world [10]. As of May 18, 2020 a total of 4,7 million of cases of COVID19 and 315,131 related deaths have been reported worldwide [10] . In absence of treatment and vaccine, the mitigation strategy enforced by many countries during the COVID19 pandemic have been based on social distancing. Each government enacted a series of restriction aecting billions of people including recommendation of restricted movements for some or all of their citizens, and localized or national lockdown with the partial or full closingo of nonessential companies and manufacturing plants [5] . Italy has been the rst European country aected by COVID19. The country has been strongly hit by the epidemic which has triggered progressively stricter restrictions aimed at minimizing the spread of 1 the coronavirus. The actions enacted by the Italian government began with reducing social interactions through quarantine and isolation till to reach the full lockdown [1, 30] . On May 4, 2020, the phase two began, marking a gradual reopening of the economy and restriction easing for residents. One week later, shops also reopened and the restrictions on mobility were essentially eliminated, with the only obligation in many regions to use protective masks [32] . During the period that stretches between January 22, 2020 and May 18, 2020, Italy suered 225,886 ocial COVID19 cases and 32,007 deaths [33] . The scientic community has promptly reacted to the COVID19 pandemic. Since the early stage of the pandemic a number of mathematical models and methods has been used. Among the main concerns raised were: predicting the evolution of the COVID19 pandemic wave worldwide or in specic countries [12, 25, 42] ; predicting epidemic peaks and ICU accesses [46] ; assessing the eects of containment measures [12, 14, 24, 25, 35, 42, 45] and, more generally, assessing the impact on populations in terms of economics, societal needs, employment, health care, deaths toll, etc [20, 36] . Among the mathematical approaches used, many authors relied on deterministic compartmental models. This approach has been revealed successful for reproducing epidemic curves in the past SARSCoV outbreak in 20022003 [26] and has been employed also for COVID19. Specic studies focused on the case of epidemic in Italy: Gatto et al. [24] studied the transmission between a network of 107 Italian provinces by using a SEPIA model as core model. Their SEPIA model discriminates between infectious individuals depending on presence and severity of their symptoms. They examined the eects of the intervention measures in terms of number of averted cases and hospitalizations in the period February 22 March 25, 2020. Giordano et al. [25] proposed an even more detailed model, named SIDARTHE, in which the distinction between diagnosed and nondiagnosed individuals plays an important role. They used the SIDARTHE model to predict the course of the epidemic and to show the need to use testing and contact tracing combined to social distancing measures. The mitigation measures like social distancing, quarantine and selfisolation may be encouraged or mandated [42] . However, although the vast majority of people were following the rules, even in this last case there are many reports of people breaching restrictions [4, 47] . Local authorities needed to continuously verifying compliance with mitigation measures through monitoring by health ocials and police actions (checkpoints, use of drones, ne or jail threats, etc). This behavior might be related to costs that individuals aected by epidemic control measures pay in terms of health, including loss of social relationships, psychological pressure, increasing stress and health hazards resulting in a substantial damage to population wellbeing [6, 20, 53] . As far as we know, the mathematically oriented papers on COVID19 nowadays available in the literature do not explicitly take into account of the fraction of individuals that change their social behaviors solely in response to social alarm. From a mathematical point of view, the change in social behaviors may be described by employing the method of informationdependent models [40, 54] which is based on the introduction of a suitable information index M (t) (see [40, 54] ). This method has been applied to vaccine preventable childhood diseases [16, 54] and is currently under development (see [8, 37, 59] for very recent contributions). In this paper, the main goal is to assess the eects on the COVID19 epidemic of human behavioral changes during the lockdowns. To this aim we build up an informationdependent SEIRlike model which is based on the key assumption that the choice to respect the lockdown restrictions, specically the social distance and the quarantine, is partially determined on fully voluntary basis and depends on the available information and rumors concerning the spread of the COVID19 disease in the community. A second goal of this manuscript is to provide an application of the information index to a specic eldcase, where the model is parametrized and the solutions compared with ocial data.",

We stress the role played by circulating information by evaluating the absolute and relative variations of diseaseseverity indicators as functions of the informationrelated parameters. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce the model balance equations and informationdependent processes. Two critical epidemiological thresholds are computed in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to model parametrization for numerical simulations, that are then shown and discussed in Section 5. Conclusions and future perspective are given in Section 6.",

The presymptomatic transmission (i.e. the transmission from infected people before they develop signicant symptoms) is also relevant: specic studies revealed an estimate of 44% of secondary cases during the presymptomatic stage from index cases [27] . On the contrary, the asymptomatic transmission (i.e. the contagion from a person infected with COVID 19 who does not develop symptoms) seems to play a negligible role [55] .

More precisely, the median incubation period is estimated to be from 56 days, with a range from 114 days, and identication of the virus in respiratory tract specimens occurred 12 days before the onset of symptoms [19, 56] . Hence, we set the latency (\u03c1) and prelatency (\u03b7) rates to 1/5.25 days \u22121 and 1/1.25 days \u22121 , respectively. From [24] , the specic informationindependent transmission rates for the presymptomatic (\u03b5 p \u03b2 b ), asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic (\u03b5 m \u03b2 b ) and severely symptomatic (\u03b5 s \u03b2 b ) cases are such that \u03b5 m /\u03b5 p = 0.033 and \u03b5 s /\u03b5 m = 1.03. They are in accordance with the observation of high viral load close to symptoms onset (suggesting that SARSCoV2 can be easily transmissible at an early stage of infection), and with the absence of reported signicant dierence in viral load in presymptomatic and symptomatic patients [19] . We set \u03b2 b = 2.25 days \u22121 , which, together with the other parameters, leads to the basic reproduction number R 0 \u2248 3.49, a value falling within the ranges estimated in [19, 24, 42, 56] . As in [35] , we consider that just 8% of infectious individuals show serious symptoms immediately after the incubation phase, yielding p = 0.92. Nonetheless, people with initial mild symptoms may become seriously ill and develop breathing diculties, requiring hospitalization. It is estimated that about 1 in 5 people with COVID19 show a worsening of symptoms [34] within 45 days from onset [28] , giving \u03c3 m = 0.2/4.5 \u2248 0.044 days \u22121 . Instead, the possibility that the aggravation happens during the quarantine period is assumed to be more rare: \u03c3 q = 0.001 days \u22121 . Governmental eorts in identifying and quarantining positive cases were implemented since the early stage of epidemics (at February 24, 94 quarantined people were already registered [33] ), hence we consider the daily mandatory quarantine rate of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic individuals (\u03b3 0 ) for the whole time horizon. From current available data, it seems hard to catch an uniform value for \u03b3 0 because it largely depends on the sampling eort, namely the number of specimen collections (swabs) from persons under investigation, that varies considerably across Italian regions and in the dierent phases of the outbreak [28, 33] . Since our model does not account for such territorial peculiarities and in order to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated, we assume that \u03b3 0 = 1.3\u03c3 q , namely it is 30% higher than the daily rate at which members of the I m class hospitalize, yielding \u03b3 0 \u2248 0.057 days \u22121 . Simulations with such a value provide a good approximation of the timeevolution of registered quarantined individuals at national level, as displayed in Fig. 4 , second panel.",

Preliminary data indicate that the virus can persist for up to eight days from the rst detection in moderate cases and for longer periods in more severe cases [19] , suggesting T m = 6 days is an appropriate value. As far as the time spent in hospitalization or quarantine, in the lack of exact data, we assume T s < T q , because hospitalized individuals are likely to receive a partly eective, experimental treatment: mainly antibiotics, antivirals and corticosteroids [28] . Moreover, shortages in hospital beds and intensive care units (ICUs) lead to as prompt as possible discharge [22] . In particular, we set T s = 18 and T q = 25 days, by accounting also for prolonged quarantine time due to delays in test response (if any) and for WHO recommendations of an additional two weeks in home isolation even after symptoms resolve [57] . Crucially, we also estimate the initial exponential rate of case increase (say, g 0 ), by computing the dominant eigenvalue of the system's Jacobian matrix, evaluated at the diseasefree equilibrium.

Finally, on March 22, 2020, the phase one of restrictions was completed when a full lockdown was imposed by closing all non essential companies and industrial plants [1] . On May 4, Italy entered the phase two, representing the starting point of a gradual relaxation of the restriction measures. One week later, shops also reopened and the restrictions on mobility were essentially eliminated, with the only obligation in many regions to use protective masks [32] . Because data early in an epidemic are inevitably incomplete and inaccurate, our approach has been to try to focus on what we believe to be the essentials in formulating a simple model.

Values range for the information coverage k and the average time delay of information 1/a are mainly guessed or taken from papers where the information index M is used [7, 8, 15, 16] . The former may be seen as a`summary' of two opposite phenomena: the disease underreporting and the level of media coverage of the status of the disease, which tends to amplify the social alarm. It is assumed to range from a minimum of 0.2 (i.e. the public awareness is of 20%) to 1. The latter ranges from the hypothetical case of prompt communication (a = 1 days \u22121 ) to a delay of 60 days. We tune these two parameters within their values range in order to reproduce the curves that best t with the number of hospitalized individuals (I s ) and the cumulative deaths as released every day at 6 p.m. (UTC+1 h) since February 24, 2020 by the Italian Civil Protection Department and archived on GitHub [33] . We nd a good approximation by setting k = 0.8 and a = 1/3 days \u22121 , meaning a level of awareness about the daily number of quarantined and hospitalized of 80%, resulting from the balance between underestimates and media amplication and inevitably aected by rumors and misinformation spreading on the web (the socalled`infodemic' [44] ). Such awareness is not immediate, but information takes on average 3 days to be publicly disseminated, being the communication slowed by a series of articulated procedures: timing for swab tests results, notication of cases, reporting delays between surveillance and public health authorities, and so on. Of course, parameters setting is inuenced by the choice of curves to t. Available data seem to provide an idea about the number of identied infectious people who have developed mild/moderate symptoms (the fraction that mandatorily stays in Q) or more serious symptoms (the hospitalized, I s ) and the number of deaths, but much less about those asymptomatics or with very mild symptoms who are not always subjected to a screening test.",

We assume \u03b2 0 = 0 and \u03b3 0 as in Table 1 (no social distance restrictions were initially implemented, but quarantine eorts were active since then) and disregard the eect of information on the human social 12 .

In absence of reactivity to information, the cumulative incidence would have been much less impacted by lockdowns restrictions (11.4 \u00b7 10 5 vs 7.8 \u00b7 10 5 on May 18) and the number of quarantined would have been reduced to those forced by surveillance authorities. As a consequence, the peak of hospitalized patients would have been about 77% higher and 10 days timedelayed, with a corresponding increase in cumulative death of more than 100%. For all reported dynamics, the detachment between the responsive and unresponsive case starts to be clearly distinguishable after the rst step reduction of 64% in transmission rate (on March 12). Trends are also compared with ocially disseminated data [33] (Fig. 4 , blue dots), which seem to conform accordingly for most of the time horizon, except for CI, that suers from an inevitable and probably high underestimation [24, 25, 38, 42] . As of May 18, 2020, we estimate about 780,000 contagions, whereas the ocial count of conrmed infections is 225,886 [33] .",

On the other hand, even in case of low coverage and high delay (case (iii)), the information still has a not negligible impact on disease dynamics: nal cumulative incidence and hospitalized peak reduce till 6%, nal cumulative deaths till 11% and quarantined peak increases of 57% about (Table 4 , fourth line). As mentioned above, information and rumors regarding the status of the disease in the community aect the transmission rate \u03b2(M ) (as given in (7)) and the quarantine rate \u03b3(M ) (as given in (8)). In our last simulation we want to emphasize the role of the information coverage on the quarantine and transmission rates. In Fig. 7 a comparison with the case of low information coverage, k = 0.2, is given assuming a xed information delay a \u22121 = 3 days (blue dotted lines). It can be seen that more informed people react and quarantine: an increasing of the maximum quarantine rate from 0.32 to 0.69 days \u22121 (which is also reached a week earlier) can be observed when by increasing the value of k till k = 1 (Fig.  7, second panel) . The eect of social behavioral changes is less evident in the transmission rate where increasing the information coverage produces a slight reduction of the transmission rate mainly during the full lockdown phase (Fig. 7, rst panel) . This reects the circumstance that the citizens compliance with social distancing is not enhanced by the informationinduced behavioral changes during the rst stages of the epidemic. On the other hand, a widespread panic reaction may lead people to`do it as long as you can' (see, for example, the case of stormed supermarkets at early stage of the epidemic [48]).",
