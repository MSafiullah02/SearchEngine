Until recently, many EDs recorded patient information on a \u201cstatus board\u201d in plain view of passersby and other patients.7 Endemic crowding in today's EDs also interferes with protection of privacy and confidentiality.8, 9 Semiopen wards, congested hallways, and a fishbowl atmosphere provide little or no physical privacy and limited opportunities to communicate personal information confidentially.",

Despite risks to their privacy and confidentiality, however, severely ill or injured patients often have little choice but to accept care in the ED, because they depend on others for transportation and only the ED offers round-the-clock care to all in need. Thus, acutely ill or injured ED patients are highly vulnerable to harmful disclosures and remain at the mercy of their caregivers to protect their confidential information.",

When morally complex situations arise in medicine, physicians typically confront a variety of interests and moral or legal duties that appear to conflict. In response, physicians must engage in careful clinical and moral reasoning. Such reasoning should generally include a clear statement of the problem, collection of relevant information, identification of options for action, comparative evaluation of the options, a decision, action, and assessment of the consequences. In evaluating options for action, physicians must weigh the various reasons (rights, duties, values, interests) for and against different options and choose the option that, all things considered, has the strongest reasons in its favor. Emergency care often requires rapid decisions. Emergency physicians should, therefore, examine potential moral conflicts involving privacy and confidentiality in advance of actual emergency situations and settle on appropriate courses of action for particular circumstances. Using this critical reasoning process, emergency physicians will decide in some situations to protect confidentiality and in others to override it to secure another important value or carry out another important duty.",

Other state courts have varied about whether that duty is a duty to warn or a duty to protect and whether the duty owed is to an identified victim or to any \u201cforeseeable\u201d victim. The level of risk of harm that engenders the duty to warn has also varied from decision to decision.
