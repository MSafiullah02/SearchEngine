For many years, international health was a fi xture in the public health vocabulary to describe public health activities outside of one's country or between countries. As times and situations in the world have evolved, the terms to refl ect these global changes have become more refi ned. However, to date, no single defi nition of global health has been widely adopted. As often occurs in a relatively new fi eld, there appears to be ambiguity and elusiveness about what the fi eld is. Most of the literature about global health suggests that global health includes health-related issues that cross national boundaries, are common to all people, and for which solutions can be translated to many different communities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Global Health"}, {"text": "A good place to start in looking at the fi eld is to examine its genesis. Often, the terms international health and global health have been considered to be synonyms, and many considered it unnecessary to differentiate between them [ 9 ] . Conversely, others believe that differentiating the two terms helps global health practitioners develop clearer policy and direction. Brown et al.'s view is that the term international was meaningful in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century when the focus was \"control of epidemics across boundaries between nations,\" and the relationships regarding policies and practices of public health between the sovereign nations were central to solving health problems [ 10 ] . As the focus developed into a consideration of health needs of people worldwide \"above that of particular nations\", with increasing involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the term global health better described the worldview. As part of an initiative from the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) Executive Board, an examination was made to highlight the fundamental similarities and differences between global, international, and public health [ 11 ] . They determined that attributes of geography, cooperation, populations, access, and disciplines offer the best insights. In global health, the health issues transcend national boundaries, solutions require worldwide cooperation and involve both prevention and clinical care, health equity is a necessary pursuit among all nations, and collaborations are developed within and among multiple disciplines (Table 31 .1 ).

We propose that global health informatics is the informatics discipline focused on empowering people to use appropriate technology to provide information-based solutions with a global perspective that support health care for all. The mission of global health informatics is to share informatics knowledge, skills, and research, and foster local innovations to promote highest standards of health for all with an emphasis on low income, low resource countries and the medically underserved.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Global Health Informatics"}, {"text": "Over the past 30 years the state of the world's health has improved signifi cantly.

Public health measures, new medical technologies that have been readily adopted, and improved health literacy have all played a role in this increase. Collective global health actions also have been central to increasing the standard of health for all people. The foundation for these changes can be traced back to two critical policy statements: the 1978 WHO Declaration of Alma-Ata, which called for urgent action by governments and the world community to promote health of all the people of the world, and the 2000 United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration, which built upon the ideas of the Alma-Ata Declaration more specifi cally by outlining eight goals, each with measureable objectives to be achieved by 2015 [ 13 ] .

The authorization was for 5 years and up to US$15 billion for HIV care, treatment, and prevention, and included support for capacity building and strategic information (i.e., surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation) in 15 focus countries, and for initiatives by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and UNAIDS. This initiative is considered to be the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in history [ 16 ] . The 15 focus countries were among the countries hardest hit by HIV disease: Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Viet Nam, and Zambia. In 2008, US Public Law 110-293, Tom Lantos and Henry J.

Building on the established prevention, care and treatment, capacity building, and strategic information programs, PEPFAR II emphasizes country partnership and ownership, and strengthening of health systems. PEPFAR remains the largest funder of global health initiatives and has many successes in reducing the burden of HIV/AIDS in the focus countries.

All of the PEPFAR focus countries had major defi ciencies in their national health information systems. During the fi rst years of PEPFAR, the aim was to assist countries in developing health information system infrastructure that would support the national and PEPFAR HIV/AIDS programs. Health management information systems (HMIS) were developed to help report the 41 core indicators that were required as a condition of funding. These indicators and other nationally-oriented indicators were also used for policy development, program planning, implementation, and identification of best practices. These systems frequently were paper-based at the facility and district-levels of a country, and then captured into an electronic system at or before arriving at the Ministry of Health. In the countries with electronic data systems in facilities or districts, the effort was placed on harmonizing data elements and core data sets.

Electronic medical records (EMR), laboratory information systems (LIS), and other patient-level systems are being implemented. This growth in patient-level systems has created a greater need to standardize functional and technical requirements for health information systems, design systems that facilitate and enable interoperability between different systems (e.g., EMRs, LIS, pharmacy, and others), facilitate linkage and de-duplication of records, and strengthen data security, privacy, and confi dentiality measures.

Outpatient diagnoses were recorded on a monthly tally sheet, and inpatient data was abstracted from a three-part discharge form. A team of data entry clerks entered data from the paper forms into computers using customdeveloped data entry software written in dBase IV. Following a national review in 2001, a series of paper-registers were introduced, replacing tally sheets and discharge forms as the primary form of data collection. This shift to using registers for data collection required that health facilities manually aggregate their own data before reporting it. Particularly at district and central hospitals, the registers were increasingly being completed by lay clerks with little or no training in health or medical terminology, rather than by clinicians and nurses.

Clinicians were over-burdened with patient care, and perceived documentation for \"statistical\" purposes as outside the scope of clinical work and therefore not part of their responsibilities. We hypothesized that an electronic information system designed to support the delivery of healthcare in a resource-poor setting may provide clinicians and nurses with tools that would augment their ability to effi ciently and effectively deliver healthcare, while collecting data as a transparent byproduct of system use.

Recognizing that to develop computer literacy among the users would take time, we opted for an entirely touchscreen-driven user interface. Secondly, power outages at the hospital were frequent, and would be a signifi cant threat to building a reliable system. To address this, we developed a power back-up solution around locally-available deep-cycle batteries used for solar power installations. However, rather than charging them from solar panels, we simply connected them to a charger powered by the national grid.

For inpatients, we chose only to capture the date of admission, discharge diagnosis, and the date of discharge, from which length of stay could be derived. While this seems trivial in the context of a western incarnation of an EMR, it allowed us to do a basic proof of concept.

Policies and funding are shaping the course of global health informatics as the fi eld seeks to better understand the impact that solutions have on health outcomes of the medically underserved. We promote an approach that is both top-down and bottom-up. Working in global health informatics requires an implicit recognition that the differences in countries' characteristics, health challenges, and priorities have a direct bearing on how information systems should be developed and used. When developing health information systems in low-income, resource-restrained environments, simple, focused solutions can work well in specifi c sites but are usually of limited general value. More comprehensive and adaptable informatics solutions are necessary to scale to multiples sites, multiple diseases, and large numbers of patients. Keeping a focus on the clinical and programmatic needs, not the technology, is essential to achieve better acceptance, adoption, and sustainability. Remembering that the little things do count, such as stable power, printer repair, and even paper, leads to success when a system is deployed in the fi eld. Building local expertise in system development and maintenance is necessary for on-going success and system sustainability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Way Forward"}, {"text": "Determining the value add that the users will gain from the system and then creating a system that provides the added value is critical.
