Influenza outbreaks can occur during a specific season, referred to as seasonal influenza, or influenza activity can be present throughout the year. In northern and southern hemisphere temperate zones, influenza is highly seasonal and attacks predominantly occur during the winter months. For northern hemisphere countries like the United States and Canada, seasonal influenza usually starts in November, peaks from December to March, and abates in May,10 whereas for southern hemisphere countries like Australia, the flu starts in May, peaks in June to September, and ends in November. Substantial fluctuations in influenza viral transmission patterns may occur with peaks occurring much earlier or later than anticipated.11 In contrast, tropical regions lacking a distinct winter season exhibit different patterns of activity, in which influenza viruses may be isolated year round12 with biannual influenza outbreaks.13\n",

Large mutations with viral gene reassortment that result in major hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigenic changes referred to as antigenic shifts are associated with more widespread epidemics and pandemics. Influenza A, because of their greater propensity for antigenic variation, is the only influenza virus type able to undergo antigenic shifts, whereas all 3 virus types (influenza A, B, and C) have the ability to undergo antigenic drifts.",

The virus initially attaches to the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and, if not neutralized by the host's immune system, the virus can continue to invade more and more cells as the virus descends the respiratory tract. After adsorption and binding of viral hemagglutinin to host cell sialic acid\u2013conjugated glycoproteins, the virus enters the host cell. This adsorption and binding is deemed necessary for virus cell entry,20 and is epidemiologically significant because the configuration of sialic acid\u2013conjugated glycoproteins differs from one species to another, which may exert a crucial role in limiting transfer of influenza viruses across species.21 Once the virus has entered the host cell, it immediately disrupts normal cell function and starts replicating and releasing its viral progeny. Neuraminidase is essential for viral release and propagation.22 Viral replication leads to host cell degradation and death via several mechanisms that shut off protein synthesis and release potent cytokines.23, 24 Cytokines, such as type I interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, as well as other inflammatory mediators, are thought to cause coughing and other systemic symptoms of flu.",

However, during influenza outbreaks, influenza virus types A and B are responsible for more than half of all community-acquired viral pneumonia cases. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a significant complication of influenza, accounting for 25% of all influenza deaths.46 Children hospitalized with influenza-associated pneumonia have a higher risk for intensive care admission, respiratory failure, and death compared to those hospitalized with influenza without pneumonia. Classically, influenza patients complicated with pneumonia have an exacerbation of fever and respiratory symptoms after an initial improvement. The most common bacterium is S pneumonia, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenza are also important common organisms. During the 2006 to 2007 influenza season, 51 cases of community-acquired S aureus pneumonia were reported to the CDC. Almost 50% of these cases had antecedent or concomitant viral illness, and just under 80% of the S aureus cultures were MRSA. The median age was 16 years, 44% had no known pertinent medical history, and approximately half of patients, for whom final disposition was known, died a median of 4 days after symptom onset. Despite the selection bias in the cases reported, community-associated S aureus (CA-MRSA) pneumonia accounts for severe pneumonia with high mortality in young otherwise healthy patients with influenza. Therefore, empiric therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia should include treatment against S aureus, including MRSA.47\n",

Confirmation of influenza virus infection is not required for clinical decisions to prescribe antiviral medication. The decision to administer influenza treatment or chemoprophylaxis should be based on clinical illness and epidemiologic factors, and the start of therapy should not be delayed pending results, especially during an influenza outbreak.51 Influenza diagnostic testing is not clinically indicated when test results will not alter a patient's clinical care or influence clinical practice for other patients (Fig. 1\n). A positive influenza test may be used to confirm influenza virus in the community, which may affect clinical practice related to home care guidance, hospital infection control practices, future testing practices, and so forth. Neither the rapid influenza test nor clinical prediction rules were superior to clinical judgment alone in the diagnosis of influenza. In one study of 258 patients with 21% confirmed influenza, the overall clinical judgment had a sensitivity of 29% (95% CI, 18%\u201343%) and specificity 92% (95% CI, 87%\u201395%), which improved to a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 39%\u201386%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI, 81%\u201399%) when patients presented within 48 hours. Rapid influenza tests only had a sensitivity of 33% (95% CI, 22%\u201347%) and specificity of 98% (95% CI, 96%\u201399%), and a clinical prediction rule showed a sensitivity of 40% (95% CI, 27%\u201354%) and specificity of 92% (95% CI, 87%\u201395%).53 Thus, in times of high disease prevalence such as during influenza outbreaks or epidemics, most patients exhibiting ILI symptoms can be diagnosed clinically as having influenza, without performing any diagnostic tests.

The optimal time frame for collecting diagnostic specimens largely depends on the amount of viral shedding at the time of testing. In immunocompetent children and adults, in whom viral shedding is brief, specimen samples yield the best results during the first 1 to 5 days of illness.54, 57 Low viral titers in the first 12 to 24 hours following onset of clinical illness have been suggested as a cause of false-negative results in patients tested early58; similarly, specimens obtained after 5 days of illness have an increased likelihood of false-negative results because of decreased virus shedding. Immunocompetent infants and young children spread virus for longer (\u22651 week), which ideally permits the collection of specimens after 5 days of illness.54 Irrespective of age, specimen collection in immunocompromised persons can also exceed 5 days of illness because virus shedding in this patient population can last for weeks, even months.54\n",

As a result, RT-PCR has become the recommended test of choice for accurately diagnosing influenza in a timely fashion.54 During the recent pandemic, the CDC released a method through the WHO for RT-PCR detection of influenza A that allowed clinical and reference laboratories to standardize methodology and thus produce data that could be compared between laboratories.67 However, the major advantage of RT-PCR lies in its ability to more readily detect influenza viruses in people with chronic lung diseases and immunosuppressed persons, who may exhibit lower levels of the virus.68 In these susceptible patients, RT-PCR can efficiently and accurately confirm the diagnosis of influenza to support therapeutic and infection control decisions.",

Although there are limited data available on influenza transmission related to such aerosols, many authorities recommend the additional precautions to be used when such procedures are performed.87 The number of health care workers present should be limited to only those essential for patient care and support. Those present should have received influenza vaccine. There should be a low threshold for intubation rather than using prolonged aerosol-generating procedures such as BiPAP and CPAP. The health care worker should wear respiratory protection including a fitted N95 respirator during aerosol--generating procedures. N95 respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes fit testing and training as required under the respiratory protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134) of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA).88 The procedures should be conducted in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), when feasible. AIIRs reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols and prevent spread into adjacent areas using controlled air exchanges and directional airflow. AIIR are negative-pressure rooms relative to the surrounding areas, with a minimum of 6 air exchanges per hour. The air should be exhausted directly to the outside or filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation.

Health care workers should be excluded from work for at least 24 hours after they no longer have fever. Those with ongoing respiratory symptoms should be evaluated to determine appropriateness of contact with patients. Health care workers caring for immunocompromised patients should be considered for temporary assignment or exclusion from work for 7 days from symptom onset or until the resolution of symptoms, whichever is longer.85 Administration of antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of health care workers should be considered when appropriate. Early treatment with antiviral agents and vaccination are especially important for health care workers at higher risk for influenza complications, including pregnant women and women up to 2 weeks after giving birth; persons 65 years and older; and persons with chronic diseases such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes, diseases that suppress the immune system, and morbid obesity.45 Work reassignment should be considered for those at higher risk to avoid potentially high-risk exposure such as performing or assisting aerosol-generating procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed influenza.",

In the last century, 4 influenza pandemics were caused by novel influenza viruses. The most significant was in 1918, when the so-called Spanish flu killed 40 to 50 million people worldwide.90 In 2009, there was the emergence of a novel H1N1 virus, a genetic combination of human and swine influenza viruses. Because many persons have little or no immunity to a new pandemic virus, the disease can spread quickly. With the H1N1 pandemic, the rate of infection was highest among young individuals; infections were less common in persons older than 65 years, perhaps secondary to preexisting immunity against antigenically similar viruses.91, 92, 93 There are several differences between seasonal and pandemic influenza94:\n",

The emergency physician should enquire about the patient's travel history or any close contact with persons who have traveled (especially from southeast Asia) or contact with any health care provider.95 Such patients require isolation and consultation with the infection control team.
