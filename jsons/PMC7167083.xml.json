            "text": "Influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and adenovirus (AdV) represent the most common viruses causing acute respiratory diseases resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Conventional culture methods used to isolate respiratory viruses are based on tissue culture methods utilizing a panel of cell lines that include MDCK (Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney), LLC\u2010MK2 (Rhesus monkey kidney), HEp\u20102 (laryngeal cancer), A549 (human lung carcinoma), and RD (Rhabdomyosarcoma). Maintenance of different cell lines is complicated, cumbersome, requires long turnaround times, and is expensive. The RhMK (primary rhesus monkey kidney) cell line has been used for isolation of various respiratory viruses. However, the availability of primary cells, varying susceptibility to infection with different respiratory viruses, the potential of harboring endogenous foamy virus, and high costs limit the use of this cell line in diagnostic virology laboratories. Commercial R\u2010Mix (Mix cells with A549 and Mint Lung) and super E\u2010Mix (genetically engineered BGMK and Caco\u20102 cells) have replaced the conventional cell line panel for the isolation of respiratory viruses [Lee et al., 1992; Buck et al., 2002; Weinberg et al., 2004]. Caco\u20102 cells have also been used to isolate enteroviruses, enteric viruses, and influenza viruses [Reigel, 1985; Pint\u00f3 et al., 1994; Yoshino et al., 1998; Chiapponi et al., 2010; Jahangir et al., 2010]. Several studies have also showed that Caco\u20102 cells have the ability to propagate coronaviruses NL63 and SARS from culture isolates [Spiegel and Weber, 2006; M\u00fcller et al., 2010]. However, the efficacy of Caco\u20102 cells in isolating common respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples remains unknown. In this study, the efficacy of isolating respiratory viruses from Caco\u20102 cells was compared to isolation from the conventional cell line panel.",

Human PIVs have often been associated with upper respiratory tract infections and other more severe disease, especially in immunocompromised patients [Woo et al., 2000; Cortez et al., 2001]. PIV\u20104 was associated with an outbreak involving 38 institutionalized children and three staff members [Lau et al., 2005] and also played an important role in causing acute lower respiratory tract infections in children [Ren et al., 2011].",
