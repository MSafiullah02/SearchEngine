The virus has a centrally situated nucleic acid, which is encased within a\ncapsid consisting of a protein core. Viruses are obligatory intracellular microorganisms that live inside cells, using\ncomponents of the nucleic acid and protein generating system of the host to replicate and trigger cell destruction leading\nto diseases. Alternatively, the host\u2019s defense mechanisms lead to cell destruction in an attempt to clear cells infected by\nthe viruses. The nucleic acid is RNA or DNA, which may be single-stranded or double-stranded [1]. The pathophysiology of viral infections may be attributed to the degeneration and\ncellular necrosis of the infected cells, leading to local and systemic inflammatory responses. The body\u2019s defense mechanisms\ninclude phagocytosis, humoral and cell-mediated responses and the production of interferons [2]. Interferons prevent the local spread of viruses, whereas antibodies prevent viremia,\nensure long-term immunity and sensitize infected cells to be destroyed by T-cells and macrophages [3, 4]. Cell-mediated immunity leads to an\nincrease in cytotoxic cells that then release lymphokines, including interferon.",

            "text": "The immune system plays a major role in the defense mechanism and pathophysiology of the disease caused by\nviruses. The primary host defenses against virus infection are physical/chemical barriers to infection and the immune system\n[11]. Virus infection in humans usually evokes two types of immune\nresponse. The initial rapid-onset \u2018innate\u2019 response against the virus involves the synthesis of proteins, namely\ninterferons, and the stimulation of \u2018natural killer (NK)\u2019 lymphocytes [12,\n13]. In some cases, the innate response may be enough to prevent a wide spread\ninfection. However, if the infection evolves beyond the first few rounds of viral replication, the \u2018adaptive immune\nresponse\u2019 comes into play [14]. The adaptive immune response itself has two\ncomponents: The humoral response and the cell-mediated response. Both of these components of the adaptive immune response\nresult in the production of long lasting memory cells that provides immunity to successive infections by same virus. These\nextremely precise cell-surface detecting receptors detect the antigen or certain viral proteins specific to that virus\n[4]. This process leads to an immunological memory, which then forms the origin\nfor vaccination [3]. The innate immune system provides universal host protection\nfrom infectious diseases. It identifies the presence of pathogens using numerous methods of detection. The major targets of\ninnate immune recognition are viral nucleic acids. Generally, the innate immune system detects structural features of viral\nRNA and DNA that are distinct from the host nucleic acid [15, 16].",

Subsequently, it leads to the\nactivation of the adaptive immune response, which can offer a more directed, antigen-specific, and long-term antiviral\nimmunity. The primary aim of the body\u2019s defense mechanism is to eradicate the infected cells. This is accomplished by\ncell-intrinsic mechanisms that are brought about by type-I interferons in the infected cells. It can also be implemented by\ncytotoxic lymphocytes, such as NK cells and CD8 T cells [17]. Prevention of\nentry of the virus into the host cell is an important protection process. Neutralizing antibodies primarily carry this\nout. Other methods that interfere with viral replication, gene expression and exit from the infected cells vary depending on\nthe virus and the host. Acute phase proteins and the complement system play an active role in innate immune\nresponse. Leukocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells and NK T cells, are the\nprincipal innate immune cell types that respond to viral infection [14]. C-type lectins on their cell surface recognize viral protein or nucleic acid content\nand, in the case of NK and NK T cells, changes on the cell surfaces of infected cells [18]. These cells enter tissues invaded by these microorganisms from the plasma through the\naction of cytokines that are released during infection. The adaptive immune system displays two distinct cell types: B and T\nlymphocytes. On exposure to a virus, B-lymphocytes stimulate the release of a soluble form of antibody able to bind the\ncirculating virions, effectively leading to eradication of the virus. An antiviral B-lymphocyte response is effectively\nsensitive in preventing or limiting reinfection and forms the basis of vaccination against specific viruses [19].",

The tissue injury caused by viruses at the\nsite of infection is due to the cytotoxic injury of virus multiplication and the host\u2019s immune response to infection. In\nchronic infection, the time frame of virus multiplication in the host is usually assessed in weeks, months, or even years,\nwith the host immune response spanning over prolonged periods.

As\nwith all herpesviruses, primary CMV infection remains latent lifelong and undergoes episodes of reactivation, and may\nprogress to symptomatic disease. In the last decade, CMV reactivation has been reported in immunocompetent critically ill\npatients. The incidence is variable, depending on the diagnostic method used (culture or PCR), and ranges from 12\u201333%\n[60]. The incidence of active CMV disease was found to be high in a series of\n242 immunocompetent patients subjected to ventilation for over 48 hours (16.1%) [61]. CMV should be suspected as the cause of VAP in the presence of persistent\ninfiltrates, a lack of clinical improvement and negative bacterial cultures [62]. Reactivation of CMV occurs between days 14 and 21 of the ICU stay. Reactivation may\nbegin in the lung parenchyma and is usually activated by sepsis. This process can cause a persistent increase in\ncytokine-mediated inflammatory response. Risk factors for reactivation are blood transfusion, age, previous\nhospitalization, prior corticosteroid use and burn injury. Several observational studies have shown an association between\nCMV infection in critically ill patients and poor clinical outcomes [63].",
