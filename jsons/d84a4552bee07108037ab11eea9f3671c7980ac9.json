After originating in Wuhan, China, it led to a massive loss of life and work in European countries such as Italy, France, and Spain. While there is no treatment available, the focus has been to contain the spread through national lockdowns and quarantines (Hamzelou, 2020) . The current epicenter of COVID-19 is the US with over 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths till April 14, 2020, with a rate of increase in reported new cases of over 30,000/day. While China has been able to effectively control the spread since the end of Feb, 2020 (Kupferschmidt and Cohen, 2020) , the entire world has the eyes on the second most populated country, India, which houses about 17.7% of the world population. Till 14th April, there has been a total of 11,490 cases and 398 reported deaths all over India, with increase in reported new cases of over 1000/day.

            "text": "Recent studies have suggested that the spread of COVID-19 is expected to be more in the cold and temperate climate as compared to the warm and tropical climate, consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory flu virus (Bloom-Feshbach et al., 2013) . Multiple viruses from the Coronaviridae family, including the SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV, also demonstrate seasonality and preference for low temperature and humidity (Casanova et al., 2010) . The stability of SARS CoV-2, which is responsible for COVID-19, has been reported to be similar to that of SARS CoV-1 on various types of inanimate surfaces in specific weather conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Sajadi et al. (2020) investigated the average monthly temperature and relative humidity in different parts of the world from Nov, 2019 to end of Feb, 2020 and observed the spread mainly in the countries lying in between latitudes 30-50\u00b0North, and having relatively similar weather patterns (temperature in the range of 5-11\u00b0C and relative humidity in the range of 47-79%). In another study, Oliveiros et al. (2020) investigated the effect of temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed on the rate of COVID-19 spread in China between Jan 23 to Mar 1, 2020. The rate of increase and doubling time of the number of cases were determined and compared with the weather variables using linear regression analysis. The results indicated that the doubling time of the number of cases was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with humidity. However, these correlation values were very low (R 2 b 0.18) to draw any strong conclusion. Precipitation and wind speed were found to exhibit no correlation with the doubling time of the number of cases. Bukhari and Jameel (2020) studied the effect of humidity and temperature on the emerging worldwide cases of COVID-19 between Jan 20 and Mar 19, 2020. The results indicated absolute humidity (AH) to be a better metric than relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T) to study the spread. It was also observed that 90% of the new cases until 21 Mar 2020 had occurred within a specific range of AH (4 to 9 g/m 3 ) and T (3 to 17\u00b0C). While this information on the global trend is valuable, to date, no relationships between weather and COVID-19 spread have been established for any specific country. Further studies at the local level may help improve our understanding on the realistic effect of weather on the viral spread.",

Using our results, we predicted the risky states in India, which could possibly be more vulnerable for the transmission of COVID-19 in the recent and upcoming months in 2020. We anticipate our findings to not only be beneficial to the policymakers in US and India, but also countries which are going to experience vulnerable weather conditions in 2020, to prepare medically, socially, and financially against mass spreading of COVID-19.",

Based on our findings, AH was employed as a superior prediction metric, and its relationship with the monthly average number of new cases was studied across all US states, to understand if the time interval of studied parameters has any effect on the weather and spread relationship. Finally, the vulnerable AH range determined for the US states was used to predict which Indian states would be more vulnerable for the transmission of the disease. The available and projected AH and T data of each Indian state was averaged over each month starting Jan 1, 2020 and ending Dec 31, 2020, and the vulnerable states across 12 months in 2020 were identified.",

This finding is consistent with the observation of over 50% new cases in states with 4 b AH b 6 g/m 3 in 10-day blocks when total number of new cases reported were N10,000. Also, both these states did not have any cases till end of Feb, 2020. Out of the states which already had cases by end of Feb, 2020, cumulatively, they shared b15% of the total new cases reported in Mar, 2020. On excluding New York, if all the new cases in states with 4 b AH b 6 g/m 3 were summed for Mar 1-Mar 30, 2020, they still represented N50% of the new cases. Thus, the time interval for which parameters were studied was observed to not affect the relationship between AH and number of new cases from the viral spread.",

Chandigarh and Haryana were in the same range of 8 b AH b 9 g/m 3 . Based on the vulnerable AH range identified for the US, Jammu and Kashmir was found to be the only Indian state to lie in such a range. Going from Jan, 2020 to Feb, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir was still found to be in the vulnerable AH range of 4 to 6 g/m 3 . Also, Sikkim stayed within 3 b AH b 4 g/m 3 . Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan were found to move to an 8 b AH b 9 g/m 3 range, and the new state Gujrat also lied in this same range. In Mar, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir moved to 6 b AH b 7 g/m 3 range and Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan still lied in 8 b AH b 9 g/m 3 range. However, Sikkim moved from previous 3 b AH b 4 g/m 3 range into vulnerable 4 b AH b 6 g/m 3 range. In Apr, 2020, none of the states were projected to be in the vulnerable 4 b AH b 6 g/m 3 range. In May 2020, except Sikkim, all other states will experience AH N 9 g/m 3 . In Jun, 2020 through Sep, 2020, AH across all Indian states are expected to be above 9 g/m 3 . In Oct, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir is again expected to come back to 8 b AH b 9 g/m 3 range, and Sikkim to 6 b AH b 7 g/m 3 range. Further in Nov, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir will be again in vulnerable 4 b AH b 6 g/m 3 range along with Sikkim. Finally, in Dec, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir will stay in vulnerable 4 b AH b 6 g/m 3 range and Sikkim will move to AH b 3 g/m 3 range. As the total new cases reported, as of Apr 9, 2020, in India are low (i.e., 6725) and majorly in states with AH N 9 (e.g., Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu), we did not attempt to identify any relationship between AH and new cases within the study timeline.",

This observation is consistent with our study results, where we did not see any correlation between weather parameters and the cases in the US until the number of new cases per interval was over 10,000. This study has a few limitations which should be acknowledged. Out of a large number of possible weather parameters experienced around the globe, only a few were considered specific to the US. Caution should be utilized when extrapolating these results beyond the US based weather parameters considered in this study. It should be mentioned that the role of weather in affecting the transmission rates can only be termed as correlation and not causation at this point in time. Several other factors might have also acted as confounding factors in our correlational observations such as demographic variations, healthcare infrastructure, and social policies like lockdowns. Future studies will investigate the combined effect of such variables to fully understand the transmission dynamics.",
