A novel coronavirus was isolated and found to be the cause of SARS. Although SARS has been under control, some scattering cases infected by SARS-CoVs were reported. No effective drugs are currently available to cure this disease. Gaining insight into the phylogenetic relationships among coronaviruses would be helpful to discover drugs and develop vaccines against the virus.",

They consist of a diverse group of large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and other animals (Rota et al., 2003). Excluding SARS-CoVs, coronaviruses can be divided into three groups according to serotypes. Group I and group II contain mammalian viruses, while group II coronaviruses contain a hemagglutinin esterase gene homologous to that of Influenza C virus (Lai and Holmes, 2001). Group III contains only avian viruses. Previous work showed that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group (group IV) within the genus Coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003).",

            "text": "An intuitive method is proposed to infer the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses in this article. Historically, Cork et al. proposed a three-dimensional representation of genomic sequences, called the W-curve (Wu et al., 1993). Since then, the W-curve has been used to analyze genomic sequences and study the phylogeny of bacteria (Cork, 2003, Cork et al., 2002, Cork and Toguem, 2002). Instead of the sequence alignment, we adopt a geometric method based on the Z-curve of the whole genome. The Z-curve is a three-dimensional space curve constituting the unique representation of a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be reconstructed given the other (Zhang and Zhang, 1991, Zhang and Zhang, 1994). Based on the Z-curve method, a coronavirus-specific gene-finding system ZCURVE_CoV has been developed (Chen et al., 2003), and the software is especially suitable for gene recognition in SARS-CoV genomes. The system is further improved by taking the prediction of cleavage sites of viral proteinases in polyproteins into consideration (Gao et al., 2003). Here we use the differences between the three-dimensional space curves as the foundation to derive the phylogeny of coronaviruses. The key problems are what parameters should be used to describe a curve and how to determine evolutionary distances among organisms based on a group of curves. In this paper, we use a series of parameters, such as the geometric center and the covariance matrix to reflect the center position and the distribution pattern of a curve, respectively. The result shows that SARS-CoVs form an independent group, which is consistent with previous analyses.",

            "text": "The Z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that constitutes a unique representation of a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other (Zhang and Zhang, 1991, Zhang and Zhang, 1994). The resulting curve has a zigzag shape, hence the name Z-curve. The Z-curve is briefly presented as follows. Consider a DNA sequence read from the 5\u2032 to the 3\u2032-end with N bases. Beginning from the first base, inspect the sequence one base at a time. In the nth step, where n\n = 1, 2, \u2026 , \nN, count the cumulative numbers of the bases A, C, G, and T, occurring in the subsequence from the first base to the nth base in the DNA sequence inspected, and denote them by An, Cn, Gn, and Tn respectively. The Z-curve consists of a series of nodes P\nn, where n\n = 1, 2, \u2026 , \nN, whose coordinates are uniquely determined by the Z-transform of DNA sequences (Zhang and Zhang, 1991, Zhang and Zhang, 1994)(1)xn=(An+Gn)-(Cn+Tn)\u2261Rn-Yn,yn=(An+Cn)-(Gn+Tn)\u2261Mn-Kn,zn=(An+Tn)-(Cn+Gn)\u2261Wn-Sn,n=0,1,\u2026,N,xn,yn,zn\u2208[-N,N],where A0\n = C0\n = G0\n = T0\n = 0 and x\n0\n = \ny\n0\n = \nz\n0\n = 0. Here R, Y, M, K, W, and S represent the bases of puRine, pYrimidine, aMino, Keto, Weak hydrogen bonds, and Strong hydrogen bonds, respectively, according to the Recommendation 1984 by the NC-IUB (Cornish-Bowden, 1985). The line that connects the nodes P\n0 (P\n0\n = 0), P\n1, P\n2, \u2026, until P\nN one by one sequentially is called the Z-curve for the DNA sequences inspected. The Z-curve defined above is a three-dimensional space curve, having three independent components, i.e., x\nn, y\nn, and z\nn, which display the distributions of bases of R/Y, M/K, and W/S types, respectively, along the sequence. By viewing the Z-curve, some global and local features of the sequence can be detected in a perceivable way. For almost all genome or chromosome sequences, the curves of z\nn\n \u223c \nn are roughly straight lines (Zhang et al., 2001). For convenience, the curve of z\nn\n \u223c \nn is fitted by a straight line using the least square technique(2)z=kn,where (z, \nn) is the coordinate of a point on the fitted straight line and k is its slope. Instead of using the curve of z\nn\n \u223c \nn, we will use the zn\u2032\u223cn curve hereafter, where(3)zn\u2032=zn-kn.\n",

To give an intuitive comprehension of the difference among the three-dimensional curves, we take SARS-CoV strains TOR2, BJ01, and BCoV as examples. TOR2 and BJ01 are SARS-CoVs and BCoV belongs to another group of coronaviruses. From the coordinates and the trends in Figs. 1A\u2013C, we can see that the Z-curves of TOR2 and BJ01 are almost the same while that of BCoV is significantly different from both of them, indicating that the former two have close phylogenetic relationship, whereas the relationships between the former two and the latter are more distant. Similarity of related Z-curves implies close evolutionary relationship of the organisms involved (Zhang et al., 2003) and vice versa. This constitutes the basis of the current algorithm.",

It can be seen from Fig. 2B that the vectors in the Y group, which have the greatest projections on the positive y-axis, are coplanar perfectly. They are almost in the x\u2013y plane. As can be seen from the plot, the 24 vectors are almost superposed with each other as a single vector. The phenomenon can also be seen from the data in Table 2. All of the absolute value of Cy,z\u2032i(i=1,2,\u2026,M) are smaller than 0.0059. That is to say, they all have very small projections on the z\u2032-axis and are constrained into the x\u2013y plane.

Group I includes HCoV-229E, TGEV, and PEDV and group II contains BCoV, BCoVL, BCoVM, BCoVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, MHVP, etc. All the viruses in these two groups are mammalian viruses. Group III contains only avian viruses, of which only the genome of IBV has been completely sequenced. Many researchers have analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among coronavirus genomes based on the 3C-like proteinase, polymerase, the structural proteins S, E, M, and N, respectively (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Their results indicated that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group (group IV) within the genus Coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). As shown in Fig. 3\n, four groups of coronaviruses can be seen from the phylogram. The SARS-CoVs appear to cluster together and form a separate branch, which can be distinguished easily from other three groups of coronaviruses. IBV, belonging to group III, is situated at an independent branch, whereas the TGEV, PEDV, and HCoV-229E, which belong to group I, tend to cluster together. In another branch, the group II coronaviruses, including BCoV, BCoVL, BCoVM, BCoVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, and MHVP tend to cluster together. First, group I and group II, which are all mammalian viruses, cluster together forming a bigger group. Second, this group joins group III, which contains only avian viruses, to form a much bigger group. Finally, SARS-CoVs join them and result in the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 3. The resulting monophyletic clusters agree perfectly with the established taxonomic groups. To validate the current method, a set of random sequences were used as a control. We generated 100 random sequences meeting the requirements in the method. Each time a phylogenetic analysis was done using 25 sequences including one random sequence and the 24 genomes. Consequently, 100 phylogenetic trees were obtained. Ninety-eight out of the 100 trees showed that the random sequence formed a distinct group without disturbing the other four groups. Only two of the random sequences disturbed the four groups, suggesting that the current method is solid with respect to the situation that a random sequence is added.",

However, the question that how SARS-CoVs emerged suddenly still remains open. Rota et al. and Marra et al. performed phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments using different genes. The results indicated that SARS-CoVs belong to a new group but the original group that SARS-CoVs were derived from could not be determined (Rota et al., 2003). The detection of SARS-CoV-like viruses in Himalayan palm civets and other small animals in live retail market indicates a rout of interspecies transmission, although the natural reservoir is unknown. Virus infection was also detected in humans working at the same market. All the animal isolates retain a special 29-nucleotide fragment, which is not found in most human isolates (Guan et al., 2003). Stavrinides and Guttman made phylogenetic analysis on the SARS virus replicase, surface spike, matrix, and nucleocapsid proteins. The results support a mammalian-like origin for the replicase protein, an avian-like origin for the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins, and a mammalian\u2013avian mosaic origin for the host-determining spike protein. They proposed that a recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent viruses within the S gene might have taken place (Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004). However, the phylogenetic inference based on genome contents tends to locate the recombinant outside of related genomes, such as seen in Fig. 3. Therefore, we emphasize that it is very unlikely to trace back the evolutionary history such as the recombination event using the method presented.",

The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3) reveals that the SARS-CoVs have undergone an independent evolution path after the divergence from the other coronaviruses. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the distance between the SARS-CoVs and all the others is the greatest. We supposed that the precursor of SARS-CoV may have existed in some hosts and developed separately for many years. Grigoriev found that the mutational patterns in SARS-CoV genome were strikingly different from the other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates (Grigoriev, 2004). Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARS-CoV was diverged far from all the three known groups of coronavirus (Gu et al., 2004). The overall level of similarity between SARS-CoVs and the other coronaviruses is low (Rota et al., 2003). We suppose that this is due to different evolution paths. The isolation of SARS-CoV-like virus in Himalayan palm civets indicates a route of interspecies transmission. We hypothesize that some events such as the nucleotide deletion or mutation in some important genes of the precursor may have resulted in the change of host range.",

Now phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is well developed. Sequence alignments are always based on some special genes or some conserved fragments (Saitou, 1996). Such analysis can be done at both the amino acid level and the nucleotide level. To overcome the biases caused by individual genes or genome segments, it is valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences. Being different from the sequence alignment method, the current method is a geometric approach which is based on measuring the differences of Z-curves of whole genomes, including coding and non-coding sequences. There is no need to search for similar sequences. Probably, the most remarkable advantages of the present method is its simplicity and intuitiveness.",

Phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is usually done on the most conservative part of a gene. These fragments are usually coding sequences, especially the sequences coding for catalytic sites or the core of proteins, because they tend to be more evolutionarily conserved. It was said by a virologist that people could not simply assume that a virus can be represented by its polymerase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTV/). A virus must be viewed as a whole. Non-coding sequences also play an important role in the virus, so do the less conserved genes. In addition, analyses based on different genes may lead to different results. Consequently, by using complete genomes one can avoid choosing which genes to be aligned. Therefore methods that are based on the whole genome are likely to be more objective. Recently, a k-string composition approach was proposed to analyze prokaryote phylogeny based on the whole proteome and satisfactory results were obtained (Qi et al., 2004); however, such analysis must rely on the annotation information. In contrast, the complete genome sequence is the only input of the current method; neither the annotation information, nor any adjustable parameters are needed. It is noteworthy that the current method is performed automatically without any human intervention.",

The Z-curve contains all the information that the corresponding DNA sequence carries. Many characteristics of a genome with biological meaning can be observed from the corresponding Z-curve, such as the replication origins and genomic islands for some bacterial and archaeal genomes (Zhang et al., 2003). We can inspect a genome in an intuitive way regardless of the gene content and gene order, even though the sequences are of different lengths. If the Z-curves of two species show similar pattern even though the genomes have different lengths, one may infer that they are evolutionarily close organisms, and vice versa. In this paper, we use the geometric center and the eigenvectors to describe the pattern approximately. Although this is only a rough approximation, it represents just an attempt to apply the Z-curve method to the phylogenetic analysis and the results obtained agree well with previous analyses.",

Phylogenetics analysis is based on the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. In this paper, the 24 genomes under study all belong to the same genus Coronavirus. Additionally, the differences of length among genomes are not very large. If the genomes under study have much farther phylogenetic relationships, and the differences in length are considerably large, the present method may not work. Consequently, cautions must be taken when using the present method to study the phylogeny of organisms with far evolutionary distances. In addition, unlike the estimation based on comparison of orthologous genes, the Z-curve approach is also sensitive to genome rearrangements: a single large-scale inversion can change the form of Z-curve drastically. Therefore, the method presented here is considerably limited in the cases of genome rearrangements. In addition, as mentioned above, the three-dimensional Z-curve is approximately depicted by a few parameters, such as the geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors. Consequently, information contained in the Z-curve is lost considerably in so doing. It is reasonable to suppose that the more information is extracted from the Z-curve, the more accurate result can be gained. Therefore, the current method can be improved if new and more effective algorithms are proposed to extract information contained in the Z-curves. In summary, although the present method has some advantages, it is still in its premature stage. The method may not be applied to some general cases, therefore the applications of it are considerably limited at present.",
