After the target splenocytes differential labeled with CSFE were transferred into immunized or control mouse intravenously, specific antigen-labeled target cells were killed while the antigen unlabeled target would have survived. Fig. 4\nshows that the degree of specific lysis is achieved in target cells isolated from the lymph node 4 h after the transfer into the immunized syngeneic host. The specific lysis of target cells at 50.6% (Fig. 4E) was observed in the mice immunized with the pcD3d/N construct, at 17% with those injected with the pcD3d/M construct (Fig. 4D), and at 5.6% with the group injected with the pcD3d/E construct (Fig. 4C).

It induces immune responses to, and in some cases even leads to, the protection against various types of infection, such as influenza, malaria, and SARS [22], [23], [24]. A common feature of the DNA vaccination is that the synthesis of the antigen occurs in intracellular compartments, allowing the processed antigen to enter the MHC class I pathway [25], in turn to generate CD8+ CTL activities. In this report, we demonstrated that both humoral- and cellular-mediated specific responses could be induced by DNA constructs encoding N, M, and E antigens against the SARS-CoV. All three DNA constructs induced SARS-CoV-specific antibodies in mice and the pcD3d/N group showed the highest titer of antibodies (1:4800), followed by the pcD3d/M group (1:3200) and the pcD3d/E group (1:2400) (Fig. 2). In addition, the T cell proliferation and DTH responses were also successfully induced in mice after vaccinations with these constructs (Fig. 3 and Table 1). These results suggested that the DNA vaccine was effective to prime a specific anti-SARS-CoV response to and apparently generate a broad range of both T-helper and B-cell memory during the priming. This was also consistent with previous observation of the protective immunity [26], [27]. Furthermore, the administration with DNAs generated a lower level of IL-10 (Fig. 5), suggesting that a locomotor\u2019s role of DNA initiated Th1 polarized immunity.",

Several studies have found that the nucleocapsid protein could induce CTL responses in the cases of the human Hantaan virus [28], the lethal coronavirus peritonitis virus [29], and SHIV-1 [30]. Recently, Zhu et al. [31] have found that a DNA construct based on the pcD3d vector could successfully induce SARS-CoV N protein-specific immune responses in a manner of inducing high antibody titers and CTL responses. Kim [32] has demonstrated that the vaccination with N DNA vaccine could successfully induce a SARS-CoV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response and distinctly reduce the titer of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SARS-CoV N protein after the challenge and that the co-expression of calreticulin (CRT), a 46 kDa Ca2+-binding protein, with N gene could enhance its ability to protect against viral challenges. In the present study, it was consistent with their work that the N protein construct could induce the highest SARS-specific IgG, T cell proliferation, and in vivo CTL response (lysis rate of 50.6%) compared with M protein gene (lysis rate of 17%) and E protein gene (lysis rate of 5.6%) (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the highest Th1 type response based on expressions of the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 was also induced by N protein. However, the higher level of immune responses generated by the pcD3d/N vaccine may be due to more epitopes in the N nucleocapsid protein since it contains 422 amino acid residues, while the M protein has 220 amino acids; and the E has 76 amino acids. In addition, the differential concentrations of each antigen presented in the killed SARS-CoV preparation could have also contributed to the differences.",
