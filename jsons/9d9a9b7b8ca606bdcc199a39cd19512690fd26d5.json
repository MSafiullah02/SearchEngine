After primary recruitment and preoperative evaluation, the patients received routine monitoring (electrocardiography, SpO 2 , noninvasive blood pressure measurement; Infinity Delta XL, Dr\u00e4ger Medical, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) and a 18-20-G intravenous catheter was established. After preoxygenation to an fraction of expired oxygen of 0.8, anesthesia was induced with 0.3-0.5 \u03bcg\u2022kg \u2212 1 predicted body weight [10] iv sufentanil (Janssen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany) and 2-3 mg\u2022kg \u2212 1 actual body weight iv propofol (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he, Germany). Tracheal intubation was facilitated with 0.6 mg\u2022kg \u2212 1 predicted body weight iv rocuronium (Fresenius Kabi). If the patient required a rapid sequence induction, neuromuscular blockage was performed by the administration of 1.0 mg\u2022kg \u2212 1 predicted body weight iv rocuronium. Neuromuscular blockage was monitored with a mechanomyograph (TOFscan; Dr\u00e4ger Medical). For tracheal intubation, we used tracheal tubes with low pressure cuffs (internal diameter of 7.0-7.5 mm for women and 8.0 mm for men; Mallinckrodt Hallo-Contour; Covidien, Neustadt an der Donau, Germany). After adequate placement of the tracheal tube, iv propofol was administered continuously (110-150 \u03bcg\u2022kg \u2212 1 \u2022min \u2212 1 ). Potential hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg) was treated with a continuous infusion of iv noradrenaline (0.03-0.2 \u03bcg\u2022kg \u2212 1 \u2022min \u2212 1 ). Perioperative volume requirements were addressed with a crystalloid solution (8 ml\u2022kg \u2212 1 \u2022h \u2212 1 , Jonosteril; Fresenius Kabi). According to our local standard, mechanical ventilation was started as volume-controlled baseline ventilation (Fabius Tiro, Dr\u00e4ger Medical) with a tidal volume of 7 ml\u2022kg \u2212 1 predicted body weight, inspiration-to-expiration ratio of 1:2, a positive end-expiratory-pressure (PEEP) of 9 cmH 2 O and ventilation frequency set to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure between 4.7 and 5.1 kPa. These ventilation settings were based on our study protocol and in accordance with our clinical routine in obese patients. After 7 min of baseline ventilation, all patients were randomly allocated to one of two crossover groups to receive ventilation sequences either VCV-FCV or FCV-VCV for 7 min per ventilation mode. To avoid irritations due to the surgical procedure (e.g. impaired respiratory mechanics by the capnoperitoneum and electrical irritations of the measurement of Electrical Impedance Tomography), our study was performed prior to the surgical intervention. For adequate allocation, a computer generated randomization in blocks was used. Disclosure of the randomization was requested right after induction of anesthesia. A study related anesthesiologist conducted the randomization in blocks, enrolled participants and assigned participants to the interventions. During the study protocol, ventilation variables were kept constant as set during the baseline measurements. To prevent from the risks of extubation and reintubation, FCV was performed by introducing the narrow-bore tracheal tube (Tribute, Ventinova Medical B.V.) into the standard tracheal tube. Blocking the cuff of the Tritube in the lumen of the tracheal tube provided a sufficient seal. By controlling both tube's markings, placement of the Tritube's tip exceeding that of the standard tracheal tube by 2-5 mm was ensured, and the potential risk of bronchial intubation was avoided. Respiratory data were collected from both ventilators via the respective serial communication interface and analyzed offline. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was performed with PulmoVista 500 (Dr\u00e4ger Medical) in all patients to measure regional ventilation, changes in relative thoracic electrical impedance during the different ventilation phases, relative end-expiratory lung volume (\u0394EELV) and to compare the expiratory decrease in intrapulmonary air [11] [12] [13] .",

During FCV, patients were ventilated with a constant positive flow during inspiration and a constant negative flow during expiration (Fig. 1 ). To avoid intrinsic PEEP, the intratracheal pressure is monitored continuously via a dedicated pressure measurement lumen of the Tritube. During FCV, the operator is able to adjust the inspiratory flow rate, inspiration to expiration ratio, peak inspiratory pressure, end-expiratory pressure and the inspiratory concentration of oxygen. In this special ventilation mode, there is no direct way to control minute volume via tidal volumes and/or respiratory rate. However, the respiratory rate depends on the peak inspiratory pressure, the set (positive) end-expiratory pressure, the set inspiratory flow rate, the inspiration to expiration ratio and the patient's lung compliance [14] .

We derived \u0394EELV from adjusting end-expiratory impedance changes by tidal volume and tidal impedance changes as described before [7, 11] . As a first step, the lung area estimation method was applied to all EIT recordings to estimate the relevant lung area [15] . Afterwards, global tidal impedance curves were calculated. These curves represent the sum of impedance of all pixels per frame over time. To scale the absolute impedance values to milliliters, the relation between tidal impedance change and tidal volume was used. Changes of the baseline of these tidal impedance curves were determined as estimates for changes of the end-expiratory lung volume. \u0394EELV was then calculated as the difference of endexpiratory lung volume during the different ventilation phases [11] . Secondary endpoints were the respiratory system variables: plateau pressure (P Plat ), mean tracheal pressure (P mean ), mean tracheal pressure during expiration (P mean expiration ), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) and quasistatic respiratory system compliance (C RS ). To calculate C RS during FCV, the plateau pressure was determined from a short (approximately 0.1 s) end-inspiratory pause. This pause is performed automatically by the Evone ventilator (Ventinova Medical B.V.) with every ten breaths and used to calculate C RS . Non-invasively collected hemodynamic variables included mean systolic blood pressure, mean diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and heart rate. To compare relative intrapulmonary air distribution, baseline tidal impedance curves for ventral and dorsal lung areas were determined and compared as described before [7, 12] . The differences in mean lung volume (\u0394MLV) between baseline ventilation and VCV and FCV were calculated, respectively. Further, the decrease in global thoracic electrical impedance during each ventilation mode was separated into four equal sections (\u0394EI 25 , \u0394EI 50 , \u0394EI 75 and \u0394EI 100 ), then matched with the correlating decrease in tidal volume and compared successively.",

However, the comparison of tidal impedance variation revealed no differences in intrapulmonary gas distribution during the different ventilation phases. The reduced accessibility of EIT images in obese and morbidly obese patients was described earlier and may be caused by the excessive volume of fat tissue around the chest wall. In horizontal supine position, this fat tissue moves laterally and may create potential shortcuts for the electrical currents of the EIT [25] . Therefore, the resolution of the EIT is limited, which may have masked differences in intrapulmonary inhomogeneity in our patients.",

Under these conditions, the recruiting effect of FCV may have influenced C RS only to a minor extent. This hypothesis is supported by earlier investigations that demonstrated that the intratidal recruitment state might differ without affecting C RS [26, 27] . To investigate potential effects of FCV on the C RS in obese patients, longer application of FCV may be necessary.",

In preclinical [17] and clinical studies [8] , the controlled expiration improved oxygenation and CO 2 elimination. However, in contrast to other centers, placing an arterial line is not part of our standard treatment in this patient group. Therefore, we felt that such invasive approach was not justified for our study. Further, it should be stated that duration of ventilation of 7 min in each ventilation mode is too short to fully evaluate the effects of FCV on regional ventilation. It follows that further studies are required to investigate the long-term effects of FCV on measurements of regional ventilation, respiratory and hemodynamic variables in obese patients.",

In brief: the decline in global electrical thoracic impedance was separated into four equal sections (\u0394EI25 , \u0394EI 50 , \u0394EI 75 and \u0394EI 100 ) (compare Fig. 5) and matched with the tidal changes simultaneously. On each box, the central mark indicates the second quartile, the bottom and top edges indicate quartiles (25th percentile and 75th percentile). On each box, the whiskers indicate the most extreme data points. Outliers are plotted individually ('+'). * = p < 0.001 for baseline vs. FCV and VCV vs. FCV, x = p > 0.05 for baseline vs. FCV and VCV vs. FCV. Linear mixed effect model analyses were used to check for differences between the ventilation phases using R based software (jamovi project 2018, version 0.9.2.3). The randomization had no significant effect on the measured difference in end-expiratory lung volume between the ventilation phases",
