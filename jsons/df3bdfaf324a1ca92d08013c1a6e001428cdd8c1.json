Several factors can affect the clinical outcomes of MERS therapy. In our data, there was a significantly higher number of patients with hypertension and dialysis dependence in the IFN group compared with the supportive-only group. The survival time of patients receiving antiviral therapy and the efficacy of the drugs were likely reduced because of hypertension and dialysis dependence. Nevertheless, upon investigating the outcomes of 13 patients under treatment for MERS, we found that, despite the higher number of comorbidities in the IFN group compared with the supportive-only group, patients on IFN survived considerably longer from onset of symptoms than those on supportive therapy. This result highlights the potential efficacy of antiviral treatment in MERS-CoV infection. However, the number of cases is small to draw any conclusions, and further studies are definitely required.In terms of different supportive remedies, corticosteroids did not show any promising effects on the survival of infected patients, which is also consistent with previous studies.8,23,27,33 Patients with signs of severe respiratory distress, shock, or hypoxemia should be given oxygen therapy immediately, and those who cannot maintain a SpO 2 \u2265 90% with oxygen therapy should be considered for intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, noninvasive ventilation should be avoided because of the high risk of spreading the infection.34 Patients who have an indication for ventilation were more likely to have an accompanying serious condition compared with other patients,34 which could explain the higher risk of mortality among those patients as shown in our results.Because of high case fatality rate and faster progression to respiratory failure, it will be pressing to distinguish MERS from severe acute respiratory syndrome for timely management. However, it is considered a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals due to similar clinical features.35 Our results obtained with CART modeling suggest that chronic respiratory disease can be the best predictor of death in patients with MERS. Therefore, it is of utmost necessity to thoroughlyassess and continuously monitor the respiratory functions of patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection. Also, health care agencies in high risk areas are recommended to bridge any gaps in their medical facilities and personnel. They should get their staff familiar with the precautious measures that are required to face any future outbreaks. Our study is limited by the small number of included articles and patients, which hindered our ability to validate our CART model. In addition, there are no published clinical trials, and even only one ongoing clinical trial has been found, testing the combination of lopinavir/ ritonavir and IFN beta-1b therapy on MERS patients (NCT02845843). Another recent trial has been registered but not yet started recruitment, to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccine (NCT03399578). Nevertheless, further investigations are required to objectively assess the effect of antiviral therapy on the survival duration and overall outcomes of MERS-CoV infections.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
