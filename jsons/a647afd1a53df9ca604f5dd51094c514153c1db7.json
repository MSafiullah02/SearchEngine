The possible relevance of molecular mimicry between a human coronavirus and the myelin basic protein component of myelin in the generation of this autoimmune reaction was evaluated. Myelin basic protein-and virus-reactive T-cell lines were established from 16 MS patients and 14 healthy donors and shown to be mostly CD4'. In contrast to healthy donors, several T-cell lines isolated from MS patients showed cross-reactivity between myelin and coronavirus antigens. Overall, 29% of T-cell lines from MS patients (10 donors) but only 1.3% of T-cell lines from normal control subjects (2 donors) showed an HLA-DR-restricted cross-reactive pattern of antigen activation after in vitro selection with either myelin basic protein or human coronavirus strain 229E antigens. Moreover, reciprocal reactivities were only observed in MS patients (4 donors).

The possibility that some of the observed cross-reactive patterns resulted from the selection of independent virusand MBP-reactive T cells present in the overall population by either virus or MBP antigens cannot be formally excluded but would in itself also be an interesting observation since its preferential occurrence in MS patients is consistent with a possible pathological relevance. The often lower stimulation indices observed with the heterologous antigen compared to the homologous selecting antigen (see Fig, data The frequent MBP reactivity of MS patient-derived T cells selected with in vitro virus exposure is consistent with the possibility that the activation of at least a portion of the MBP-reactive T cells observed in both the periphery and the CNS of MS patients [16] could have been triggered in some of these patients by an otherwise innocuous respiratory coronavirus infection.
