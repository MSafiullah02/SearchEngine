Respiratory spread of virus during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 is thought to have principally occurred via respiratory droplets. However, aerosol spread of this virus has also been postulated, and this virus has been shown to occur in laboratory-generated aerosols. [3] The respiratory droplet concentration depends on medical parameters (breathing capacity, lungs capacity) which are depend on human height, weight, gender, age etc. The spread probability of respiratory disease depend on the droplet characteristics, which includes droplet size, concentration, droplet velocity, temperature, type of pathogen, activity of pathogen etc. It has been shown that droplet pathogens do not exclusively airborne or droplet-borne transmission but both methods simultaneously. The size of breathing droplets from healthy people is 0.1 to 8uM and the patient is 0.05 to 10uM. [4] The mode of respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not completely understood.

Coronavirus virions (or 'particles') are spherical particles with diameters of approximately 125 nm (0.125 microns). The smallest particles are 0.06 microns, and the largest are 0.14 microns. [5] [6] For the comparison with influenza virus, Influenza type A viruses are very similar in structure to influenza viruses types B, C, and D. The Influenza virus particle (also called the virion) is 80-120 nanometres in diameter such that the smallest virions adopt an elliptical shape. [1] Effect of temperature and Humidity on enveloped viruses Corona viruses are enveloped viruses with a positive sense, single stranded RNA genome. Influenza viruses are also enveloped viruses. [7] In some studies observed that the Human coronavirus, pseudorabies virus, and rotavirus are most stable at intermediate RH. The first two are enveloped, while mature rotaviruses are usually non-enveloped. [9] In these studies, the decay of virus infectivity increased rapidly at relative humidity >40%. The increased survival of influenza virus in aerosols at low relative humidity has been suggested as a factor that accounts for the seasonality of influenza. [10] Three mechanisms could potentially explain the observed influence of RH on transmission. The first acts at the level of the host: breathing dry air could cause desiccation of the nasal mucosa, leading to epithelial damage and/or reduced mucociliary clearance, which would in turn render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infections. Long-term exposure to dry air is likely to affect influenza virus growth in the upper respiratory tract, and may indeed play a role in influenza seasonality.",

The water content in the enveloped virus will evaporate based on the temperature but it will be a slow process. The slight increase in the number of viruses at higher RH (say 80%) and higher temperature is due to the evaporation of water contents from the droplets. This evaporation will cause the overall reduction in the diameter of enveloped viruses, reducing the settling velocity and hence allow them to suspend in the air for more time. Also it is worth to note that, the duration of operation of the model depends on the time taken by the infected person in the queue, ie. Moving from the end to the front of the queue including the waiting time in between. This time may not be sufficient to evaporate the entire water content of the virus and hence may not inactivate the virus at the given temperature.",
