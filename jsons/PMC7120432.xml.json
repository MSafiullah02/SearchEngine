            "text": "The number of monoclonal antibody (mAb) based drugs\ndeveloped by biopharmaceutical companies is at an all-time high with more and more novel anti-infective antibodies gaining regulatory approval. The emergence of multi-drug resistance has reinforced the need to develop novel anti-infective approaches. Unlike conventional antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies exhibit high target specificity and possess the ability to recruit immune system components for effective pathogen removal. Modes\nof action include: specific binding and neutralisation of microbial\ntoxins and virulence factors, opsonising and marking pathogens for cell-death by directing phagocytic cells to the site of infection, antibody mediated bacterial agglutination and clearance, complement activation and direct bacterial lysis [77]. Host effector functions mediated through interactions with the Fc region of mAb drugs makes them highly effective in treating immunocompromised patients that are unable to generate their own immune response to fight diseases [90]. Certain monoclonal antibodies exhibit synergistic or additive effects with conventional antibiotics providing an attractive therapeutic strategy for treating infections caused by multidrug resistant organisms [1]. This chapter discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using immunised phage display libraries constructed from mammalian sources for generating monoclonal antibodies against infectious disease targets. Several groups have successfully developed monoclonal antibodies specific for bacterial, fungal and viral antigens with potential applications in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases which are reviewed in this chapter.",

A limited number of human mAbs were also developed by using human B lymphocytes from naturally infected patients but this proved a technically challenging and generally unreliable approach [48]. Subsequent advances in antibody engineering removed or resolved many of these technology \u201croad-blocks\u201d facilitating the generation of chimeric, humanised or deimmunised mAbs and bispecific antibodies with increased potency and reduced immunogenicity. One of the major breakthroughs was the invention of phage display which revolutionised the field of antibody engineering with its robust, easy to use and highly versatile combinatorial display platform. Its successful applications include: generation of antibodies with unique functions from immune and non-immune sources, de novo isolation of high affinity binders from non-immune or synthetic sources and the in vitro affinity maturation of antibodies [43]. Phage based selection could be summarised as the display of antibodies (proteins or peptides) on the surface of bacteriophage by fusing the antibody gene to one of the phage coat proteins and selection based on the antigen binding of individual clones. Phage antibody libraries are constructed by PCR based cloning of VH and VL repertoires by random pairing into a phage or phagemid vector system and display on the surface of bacteriophage. It has been used widely in the antibody engineering as a technique to mimic B cells, which are self-replicating packaged systems containing antibody genes that encode the antibody displayed on its surface (linked genotype and phenotype) [108].",

IgG mRNA from PBLs or spleen cells of immunised animals or human patients are used to build immunised libraries. A third class called synthetic and semi-synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using repertoires of rearranged V genes from gene segments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and introducing variation into their CDR regions using custom degenerate primers encoding for diversity and length [108].",

            "text": "Unlike hybridoma technology, phage display provides researchers with more possibilities to streamlining their monoclonal antibody generation process. The main improvement is the replacement of cell culture screening steps using hybridomas. Instead of screening hundreds or thousands of hybridoma monoclonals to find positive clones, phage display, with carefully designed panning strategies, can screen billions of clones and allow the enrichment of small subsets of binders with desirable characteristics that can be further screened to identify individual binders. Antibodies recognising specific antigenic conformations and epitopes can be easily isolated by introducing selective or subtractive panning steps during the selection process. It has also been reported that using phage display high specificity antibodies can be isolated from immunised sources which would be missed by traditional immunological methods [100]. A key feature of this system is the linkage of genotype (phagemid vector) and phenotype (phage coat protein- antibody fragment) which allows immediate access to the corresponding gene sequences of selected antibodies facilitating simple subcloning into various antibody formats based on required downstream applications (Fig. 6.1). Over the last 20 years phage display technologies have been successfully used for the development of many therapeutic antibody candidates and approved drugs and with the relaxation of commercial restrictions more and more products are now entering the diagnostic and research markets as well [9].\n",

However, by combining the power of immunisation with phage display, several high affinity monoclonal antibodies against \u201cdifficult\u201d antigenic targets have been isolated from relative small antibody libraries and where traditional approaches have failed [33, 98]. Generating antibodies against self or toxic antigens is limited if immunisation is to be employed. In particular, human autoantigens are highly conserved amongst most routinely used laboratory mammals such as mice or rat. Therefore immunisation of non-mammals such as sharks and chickens, which are phylogenetically distant from humans, has been successfully employed for generating an immune response and antibodies and/or antibody like binders (VNAR) to epitopes conserved in mammalian species [42]. Chickens are phylogenetically distant from humans and therefore very successful in generating an immune response to mammalian proteins which are highly conserved [34], while sharks are even more distant from humans, diverging from a common ancestor approximately 450 million years ago [6, 37, 53].",

            "text": "Phage display libraries constructed from immune sera or bone marrow cells collected from infected patients have been used to isolate neutralising antibodies against viral infections. Human monoclonal antibodies that can selectively recognise different strains of influenza virus, Ebola virus, HIV, Herpes Simplex virus, rabies, and hepatitis B have been successfully isolated from immune human phage display libraries that have the potential for both diagnosis and therapy [13, 14, 54, 66, 76, 89, 111, 112]. Human monoclonal antibodies from patients which showed protective effects in animal model studies have also been selected against bacterial targets such as anthrax toxins [107], botulinum neurotoxin [4] and the ABC transporter of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus [12]. In the case of the West Nile Virus neutralising mAbs were only isolated from the B cell population of convalescent human patients with large phage display libraries constructed from uninfected donors delivering nothing of consequence [105]. Conventional methods of antibody generation such as hybridoma and Epstein-Barr virus transformation are limited in their abilities to evaluate human monoclonal antibodies from different patients at various stages of their clinical course. Technologies like phage display provide a powerful tool that allows pooling of large number of patient immune B cell populations and the selecting of antibodies with distinct specificities and inhibitory activities during different stages of infection [13]. The ability to improve affinities and broaden specificities post selection is a major attribute of recombinant antibodies. Using recombinant DNA and protein engineering approaches the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of these molecules can be improved including half-life extension and reduced immunogenicity. For the neutralisation of toxins and viruses, it is often advantageous to generate multiple high affinity antibodies that recognise different epitopes on the same antigen or a variety of antigenic subtypes capable of delivering broad protection against pathogen variants. Such \u2018oligoclonal\u2019 antibodies were reported to show strong synergistic activity in neutralising botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) assays [74]. A list of recombinant antibodies generated from phage display libraries constructed using the immune antibody gene repertoires of human patients is given in Table 6.1.\n",

A number of Gram negative bacteria, including pathogens like P. aeruginosa, utilise homoserine lactones (HSLs) as QS signalling compounds and engage in cell-to-cell communication to coordinate their behaviour. As QS takes a central role in P. aeruginosa infection by regulating the expression of extracellular virulence factors (and also biofilm formation), immuno-modulation of the HSL molecules by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be used as a novel approach to prevent P. aeruginosa infections. Sheep immunisation was utilised to develop antibodies with high affinity and sensitivity towards HSL compounds. A mixture of three HSLs-N-acyl-C12-HSL, 3-oxo-C12-HSL and 3-OH-C12-HSL with different subgroups at the third carbon position were conjugated to the carrier protein Thyroglobulin (TG) and used as immunogen to enhance the chance of eliciting an antibody response in sheep. Using PBLs from immunised sheep as starting material, VH-V\u03bb and VH-V\u03ba anti-HSL phage display libraries were constructed in a scFv format. The panning strategy was designed to drive selection towards the enrichment of high sensitivity and cross-reactivity clones. Lead clones were reformatted into sheep-mouse chimeric IgGs and had picomolar sensitivities (IC50 values as determined by competition ELISA) for 3-oxo-C12-HSL which is the central QS compound in P. aeruginosa. These values are quite impressive, considering the chemical nature of these lipid-like compounds (average molecular weight 300 Da) which possess only a small head like structure and lack critical antigenic features such as aromaticity or charge. Modelling of these sensitive anti-HSL antibodies indicated that the level of sensitivity observed was achieved through the generation of a deep and negatively charged binding pocket [2].",

In contrast to humans and mice, sheep B cell lymphopoiesis occurs predominantly in the ileal Peyer\u2019s patches (IPP) and V(D)J recombination creates limited diversity in the sheep Ig repertoire due to a very few gene segments participating in the rearrangement process. This characteristic feature makes sheep library construction simpler, as the entire heavy and light chain gene repertoire can be amplified using a small number of primers. Much of the antibody diversity is achieved through antigen-independent post-rearrangement somatic hypermutation, which diversifies all CDRs as compared to the sole variability of just CDR3 in humans and mice [17, 62, 78, 84]. Comparison of chicken and sheep responses by hyperimmunisation with the same immunogen revealed the ability of the sheep immune system to produce higher specificity antibodies than chicken [109]. The overall antibody titre was also much higher in sheep and might be due to the longer half-life (~15 days) of sheep immunoglobulins when compared to 35 h in chicken [106, 109]. It is also noteworthy that the sensitivities of the sheep polyclonal/mAb antibodies described here were far superior to the published mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the same HSL antigens [50].",

Furthermore, in a non-neutropenic lung model of mice infected with P. aeruginosa PA058, HSL mAb monotherapy demonstrated significant efficacy, prolonging survival by up to 83%. Since no significant reduction in bacterial counts was observed in the lungs of infected mice, it is proposed that HSL specific antibodies protect mice possibly through antibody mediated scavenging of HSL compounds. This mode of action does not necessarily affecting bacterial numbers but probably prevents a switch to a more pathogenic phenotype [78].",

            "text": "ADP-ribosylating enzymes such as cholera, pertussis, diphtheria toxins and Escherichia coli heat-labile (LT) toxins are important virulence factors for a number of extracellular bacterial pathogens. Pathogenesis is driven by the secretion of potent toxins that utilise ADP-ribosylation as the catalytic mechanism underlying their action. ADP-ribosylating toxins comprise a large family, and all produce disease by altering key metabolic processes after transfer of an ADP-ribose moiety from NAD to specific host-cell target proteins [25, 60]. It was not until the early 2000 that the ADP-ribosylating enzyme was implicated in intracellular pathogenesis. It was shown that Salmonella strains were capable of invading epithelial cells and localising in macrophages during infection [60, 61]. The Salmonella virulence plasmid factor B (spvB) virulence gene of Salmonella is required for human macrophage cytotoxicity in vitro and for enhancing intracellular bacterial proliferation during infection. Lesnick et al. provided evidence that spvB encodes an ADP-ribosylating enzyme that uses actin as a substrate and depolymerises actin filaments when expressed in CHO cells [61]. A spvB blocking camel VHH single domain antibody (sdAb) capable of blocking spvB enzymatic activity at a 1:1 molar ratio was isolated from an immune phage display library generated from an spvB immunised llama [3, 68]. As an intracellular protein, spvB is inaccessible to conventional antibodies, and small molecule inhibitors of spvB are fraught with potential side effects resulting from the indiscriminate inhibition of endogenous mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) [11, 51, 63]. The VHH sdAb when expressed as an intrabody, effectively protected cells from the cytotoxic activity of a translocation-competent chimeric C21N-C/spvB toxin, and transfected cells were also protected against cytoskeletal alterations induced by wild-type spvB-expressing strains of Salmonella [3]. This provides evidence to support the development of these sdAbs as therapeutic and experimental tools to block mammalian and toxin ARTs.",

In a neutralisation assay, their lead VHH clone completely inhibited five hemolytic units of the toxin in vitro and resisted thermal denaturation up to 99 \u00b0C. The CDR3 loop of VHHs is longer than the average IgG and linked with CDR1 by an interloop disulphide bond which renders additional stability to the protein. In some cases the long CDR3 loop enables the formation of a convex paratope that can access deep enzymatic clefts and cavities on the surface of an antigen [71]. The active sites of enzymes such as \u03b2- hemolysin are mostly situated in their largest cleft. The long CDR3 loop of anti \u03b2- hemolysin clone is believed to bind this site and able to neutralise enzyme activity by blocking access to the Hlb antigen [49].",

Multiple drug resistance associated with existing chemical anti-fungal drugs highlight the need for new, more effective antifungal therapies. Antibody based antifungal treatments can provide a much needed alternative to the near-exhausted chemical based strategies. Due to their high specificity and target selectivity, antifungal antibodies can be successfully employed for targeted killing of fungal pathogens without harming host cells. Using hybridoma technology several mAbs were generated against various antigenic components of fungal pathogens Cryptooccus neoformans, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pneumocystis jerovecii and Histoplasma capsulatum [19, 36, 40, 70, 82, 85, 87]. The murine monoclonal antibody (mAb 18B7) generated through hybridoma technology directed against the capsular polysaccharide of C. neoformans mediated protection in murine model of infection and was shown safe to use in human patients in a Phase I dose escalation study [57]. In addition to the classical antibody mediated mechanisms of phagocytosis, complement activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells, mAb 18B7 was shown to increase the stiffness of the capsule by polysaccharide cross linkage which impaired yeast budding by trapping newly emerging buds inside the parental capsule [26].",

Candida mannan specific monoclonal antibodies have been generated through sheep immunisation in our laboratory.

This antibody library, one of the very first and largest against Candida cell wall antigens, has been successfully used to isolate high affinity and specificity binders to Candida \u03b1-mannan, which are typically poorly immunogenic glycans present on the fungal cell surface. Analysis via SEM of polyclonal sera derived from immunised sheep confirmed that the library contained a varied collection of antibodies with specificity to both fungal cell wall carbohydrates (mannans and glucans) as well as a number of important cell wall proteins (Patent WO2014174293 (A1)).",

In combination immunotherapy a chemical antifungal drug is administered along with an antibody. For example, mAb B6.1 is synergistic with amphotericin B [39] and augments the therapeutic effect of fluconazole in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis [59]. These examples demonstrate the potential for antifungal mAbs in clinical settings and the use of drug combinations as a powerful strategy to enhance antifungal efficacy and abolish drug resistance.",

Using mice immunisations and sera from infected humans, several mAbs were developed against the HIV Type-1 envelop with only a few of them broadly neutralising across all HIV-1 subtypes. All these neutralising mAbs were generated as a result of human infection and antibody responses against a range of epitopes such as gp120, gp41 or various epitopes on gp120 which are exposed after CD4 binding [64]. Forsman et al. published the generation of several high affinity and cross-reactive VHHs neutralising HIV-1 primary isolates belonging to subtype B and C. Llamas were immunised with recombinant gp120 belonging to subtype B and the resultant phage display libraries were panned using recombinant gp120 from subtypes A, B and C. A competitive elution strategy using sCD4 was employed during panning to isolate clones which were shown to inhibit the binding of sCD4 to HIV-1 gp120 and gp140 from selected subtypes. It is proposed that the VHH domains inhibit HIV- 1 infection by interacting with gp120 prior to its engagement with CD4, which makes them potential HIV-1 inhibitors [32]. Subsequently, a family specific phage display library was constructed using PBLS from the same llama immunised with recombinant gp120 derived from HIV-1 CN54 and tailored using degenerate primers based on the nucleotide sequences of the CDR3-FR4 region of the positive HIV-1 neutralising VHHs described above. Resultant picomolar affinity VHHs were shown to neutralise a broad range of HIV-1 virus belonging to subtypes B and C [52].",

CXCR4 belong to GPCR family where therapeutic targeting using conventional antibodies has proved unsuccessful probably because traditional antibodies struggle to access the cryptic and buried antigenic sites that make up the ligand binding pockets on the receptor surface. CXCR4 plays an important role in stem cell physiology, tissue repair, inflammation, metastatic spread of cancer and also serves as a co-entry receptor for HIV. Highly potent nanobodies generated using whole cell immunisation (CXCR4-expressing HEK293T cells), phage display library construction and biopanning behaved as competitive CXCR4 antagonists by totally blocking ligand CXCL12 binding and inhibiting chemotaxis and HIV-1 entry [47].",

ALX-0171 (Ablynx) is a trivalent nanobody in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of RSV infections. It is one of the promising candidate biologic drugs in development for the prevention and/or treatment of RSV infections (see Mazur et al. [65] for a full review). ALX-0171 was originally isolated from a llama derived immune library as a monovalent domain prior to reformatting into a multivalent construct using genetic fusion. The VHH domain demonstrated high neutralising potency against RSV-A and RSV-B, and demonstrated superiority over palivizumab in blocking RSV replication [28].",

Trypanosoma brucei has evolved a range of sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms, which include repeatedly generating variations of the immunogenic variant-specific surface glycoprotein (VSG), efficient internalisation of antibody-VSG complexes from the surface by endocytosis and proteolysis of the immunoglobulin [7]. Due to the dense packaging of VSG protein on the surface of Trypanosoma, conventional antibodies are unable to access the more conserved VSG epitopes. High affinity nanobody clones directed towards isotype-specific and conserved epitope on the VSG protein coat, were isolated from an immunised camelid phage display VHH library. These nanobodies were found to be trypanolytic both in vitro and in vivo, which shows the potential of high affinity monovalent fragments to exert a cytotoxic effect on parasites even in the absence of Fc domain. The authors have demonstrated the modes of action of these domains which appear to include: rapid arrest of cell mobility, blockage of endocytosis, flagellar swelling, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP exhaustion [96].",
