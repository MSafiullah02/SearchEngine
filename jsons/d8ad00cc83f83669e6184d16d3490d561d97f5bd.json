As of March 7, 2020, more than 100,000 cases of disease have been confirmed globally [1] . Although most patients show mild symptoms, 26% of them develop severe and critical diseases [2] ; notably, they may exhibit acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is an important cause of COVID-2019-associated death. Patients with severe/critical disease generally receive symptomatic treatments such as antiviral therapy, anti-infection therapy, and maintenance of a stable internal environment; during such treatment, timely and effective oxygen therapy is essential. Conventional oxygen therapy by nasal catheter is only suitable for patients with mild disease; non-invasive mechanical ventilation requires man-machine cooperation and is uncomfortable. Here, we describe eight patients with COVID-2019 who were treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); our findings suggest that HFNC is a suitable choice for treatment of patients with (Table 1) . While receiving general treatment such as antiviral therapy (i.e., lopinavir/ritonavir, Interferon-\u03b1), anti-infection therapy, and nutritional support, all eight patients received low doses and short courses of corticosteroid treatment; four patients were treated with tocilizumab.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 228, "end": 231, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 989, "end": 998, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in"}, {"text": "Chest imaging of the eight patients revealed multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs with blurred edges at the time of admission; two of the eight patients exhibited air bronchogram signs after focal consolidation.

The initial oxygen concentration was set at 100%. After 2 hours of HFNC treatment, the rate of oxygenation (ROX) index was calculated as SpO 2 /(fraction of inspired oxygen \u00d7 respiratory rate) in accordance with the method used by Roca et al. [3] . The ROX indices were \u2265 4.88 in all patients; the patients were monitored continuously for 12 hours, and the ROX indices remained \u2265 4.88, indicating a high success rate of HFNC treatment.

[5] . Moreover, HFNC can reduce the intubation rate and improve clinical prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure [6] . During treatment of the eight patients in this report, we found that HFNC could fulfill their oxygen requirements. Although guidelines also recommend noninvasive ventilation when ARDS or hypoxemia cannot be alleviated after standard oxygen therapy [7] , HFNC has more advantages, compared with noninvasive ventilation, in isolation wards. First, most patients with severe/critical disease are elderly patients, typically unaccompanied by family members; the unfamiliar uniforms of the medical staff and panic regarding the disease will increase their anxiety, while claustrophobia caused by non-invasive ventilation can worsen the situation. Indeed, a 91-year-old patient with comorbid Alzheimer's disease required treatment with sedative and antianxiety drugs due to severe anxiety and panic. Second, non-invasive ventilation requires man-machine cooperation, which may be difficult for elderly patients; the extent of this cooperation directly affects the efficiency of oxygen therapy. Third, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients increased rapidly in a short period of time, resulting in a shortage of intensive care physicians and respiratory therapists who can provide patients with noninvasive ventilation; notably, HFNC can be easily implemented and managed by general physicians. Therefore, HFNC constitutes a good treatment option for patients with COVID-2019. Importantly, none of the patients admitted to our hospital with severe/critical disease required noninvasive ventilation; only one patient received endotracheal intubation to prevent death.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 138, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 285, "end": 288, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 411, "end": 414, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 665, "end": 668, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in"}, {"text": "This study was limited to a small number of patients with mild or moderate ARDS; HFNC cannot be substituted for invasive ventilation in patients with severe ARDS.
