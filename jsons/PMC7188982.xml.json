Patients with COVID-19 are in a hypercoagulable state, with blood stasis and endothelial injury due to inflammation; in addition, most elderly patients with severe COVID-19 have a previous medical history of hypertension and atherosclerosis (1\u20134). As a result, elderly patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of thrombosis and embolism. In the present article, we report a case of a 75-year-old woman diagnosed with severe COVID-19, complicated by acute cerebral infarction and venous thrombosis of the bilateral lower extremities. The patient successfully recovered after symptomatic and supportive treatments and received rehabilitation training after discharge. Arterial and venous thrombosis could occur simultaneously and lead to poor prognosis, which should be considered and prudently managed in patients with COVID-19.",

We could not, however, fully evaluate facial involvement, motor coordination, muscle tonus, and sensory functions because the medical and human resources available were limited.

While the patient was being treated for COVID-19, the sudden onset of neurological symptoms and findings of the head CT scan strongly indicated cerebral infarction in the patient. Meanwhile, our patient had normal coagulation, but showed elevated D-dimer levels, also suggesting a hypercoagulable state. However, the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated cerebral infarction remain unelucidated. It has been speculated that COVID-19 may disrupt the integrity of the vascular endothelium and upset the equilibrium between coagulation and anticoagulation by eliciting an inflammatory response, which may lead to hypercoagulation and thrombosis (2).",
