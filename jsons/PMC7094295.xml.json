            "text": "Remedy for cancer is certainly one of the big medical challenges to the scientists of 21st century and is one of the current research hotspots. The escalating research to fight against cancer is getting us closer to a future, where cancer becomes a curable disease. As a researcher, we dream of curing cancer as easy as the deadly diseases viz., chickenpox, smallpox, polio, measles, sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), yellow fever, malaria etc., [1]. Although existing drugs show efficacy, their lack of selectivity for tumor cells over normal cells can lead to severe side effects [2]. Cancer is caused by mutations that transform healthy cells into tumor cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that there will not be a match between tumors of two patients. It implies that the scientists should work on medicines that are tailored to cure a specific patient. Platinum based drugs are actively used in treating various types of cancers; however, drug resistance, adverse side effects and low specificity are common in platinum chemotherapy [3,4]. To overcome these abnormalities to great extent, in recent years other metal based drugs have been developed and tested for their anticancer efficacy [5]. Important ones are the coordination compounds of Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Ru(II) which can overcome the limited activity of cisplatin and its analogous [6,7].",

In our present work, the hydrazone Schiff base ligands derived from 9-oxo-9H-fluorene-1-carboxylic acid and their respective Co(II), Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes are synthesized impeccably and analyzed. Hydrazones play an important role in inorganic medicinal chemistry. They can easily form stable complexes with transition metal ions and can exhibit interesting photophysical and biological properties [8].

The crystal structure of the BCL\u2013XL protein bound to its respective inhibitor was collected from Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. The site to which the inhibitor molecule was bound was identified using PDBSum server. Optimization of target protein by removal ligands and hetero atoms was carried out using Discovery Studio tool. 3D coordinates files of newly synthesized compounds in \u201c.pdb\u201d format were generated using marvin sketch tool. Further these files were converted from \u201c.pdb\u201d to \u201c.pdbqt\u201d file format using Autodock 4 tool. Automated molecular docking was carried out to determine the best orientation of the newly synthesized compounds possessing anti-cancer property was hypothesized as inhibitors bound in the active site of BCL-XL protein. A Lamarckian genetic algorithm implemented in the Auto Dock 4.0 program was employed [24]. The grid map was set by adjusting the grid box centered at the following active pocket residues of the BCL\u2013XL protein [(Phe97(A), Arg102(A), Phe105(A), Ser106(A), Leu108(A), Glu129(A), Leu130(A), Asn136(A), Gly138(A), Arg139(A), Ala93(B), Phe97(B), Tyr101(B), Ala104(B), Phe105(B), Gly138(B) and Tyr195(B)]. These active pocket residues were used to generate with the AutoGrid file. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was applied for minimization, using default parameters. The number of docking runs was 10, the population in the genetic algorithm was 250, the number of energy evaluations was 100,000, and the maximum number of interactions was 10,000 [25].",

After the incubation, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 517 nm using a UV\u2013Vis Spectrophotometer. For the positive control ascorbic acid was used as a reference standard. The DPPH scavenging activity of each sample was calculated using the following equation:100% inhibition = [(Ac\u2013At)/Ac] xWhere, Ac is the absorbance of the control reaction (100 \u03bcL of ethanol with 100 \u03bcL of the DPPH solution) and At is the absorbance of the test sample.

The absence of broad band in the region 2400\u20133400 cm\u22121 infers the coordination of carboxylic acid oxygen via deprotonation. Further, the strong band due to \u03bd(CO) of carboxylic acid group has disappeared upon complex formation, since in carboxylate ion the negative charge is equally distributed on two oxygen due to resonance, thereby decreasing the bond order. This implies that the carboxylate ion is involved in bond formation [28].

In the present study untreated DNA taken as control group where as test group was taken for the metal complexes treated DNA. Different concentrations of metal complex were treated on the pBR322 DNA. In all metal complex treated DNA shown change in the band pattern by changing closed DNA (Form\u2013I) to Nicked circular DNA (Form\u2013II) and linear form (Form\u2013III). In general fast migration of DNA occurs in control DNA and in case of treated groups due to the DNA cleavage slow migration is observed. Due to the action of metal complexes super coiled DNA form undergo relaxation to produce nicked and linear form with breaks and smear appearance [44,45]. Overall findings have revealed that the tested compounds can successfully cleave the DNA as it is evident from the images reproduced in Fig. 9\n.",

            "text": "In the current study, two new methoxy and t-butyl substituted hydrazone Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were synthesized. The key precursors, ligands and their transition metal complexes were characterized by spectral (1H and 13C NMR, IR, ESI\u2013MS), analytical, TGA and molar conductance measurements. The transition metal complexes were screened for their pharmacological activities viz., DNA cleavage, cytotoxicity, anticancer and antioxidant activities. The hydrazone Schiff bases and their metal complexes successfully cleaved the pBR322 plasmid DNA. Concentration dependent cell survival rate was observed in in vitro cytotoxicity against breast cancer (MCF\u20137) cell line, which was decreased with increase in concentration. Anticancer study revealed that, the synthesized compounds show apoptotic effect which was characterized by cell shrinkage, cell breakage, turgidity and apoptotic bodies. IC50 value (<10 \u03bcgmL\u22121) for the compounds L1H, Cu(L1)2, Cu(L2)2, Ni(L1)2 and Ni(L2)2 suggests very significant activity, when compared to standard cisplatin. The antioxidant activity study shows dose dependant activity in all tested compounds i.e. the inhibition values were increased with increasing concentrations of all compounds. The compounds L1H, Ni(L1)2, Cu(L1)2, Cu(L2)2 and Ni(L2)2 exhibited significant scavenging activity with good percentage when compared with remaining tested compounds. Molecular docking studies have shown that selected compounds were having strong binding affinity with BCL\u2013XL and also acting as strong BCL\u2013XL inhibitor. The obtained docking result showed a good correlation between in vitro anticancer activity and binding free energy of selected compounds.",
