            "text": "Translation can be considered as a three-step process that is comprised of initiation, elongation and termination. Although all three stages can be regulated, translation is primarily regulated at the initiation stage and this is assumed to be the rate-limiting step of the process (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009). Translation initiation is an intricate process that culminates in an elongation-competent 80S ribosome forming at the initiation codon. Essentially two complexes are required for this process which function to bind to the mRNA, via the m7GTP cap at the 5\u2032 end of the message, recruit the ribosome and bring the initiator Met-tRNAi to the start codon. The eIF4F complex is required for both cap-binding and ribosome recruitment to the message. This complex is comprised of eIF4E (the cap binding protein), eIF4G (a scaffold protein) and eIF4A (a DEAD-box helicase) (Fig. 1A). eIF4G also contains binding sites for eIF3 and poly A binding protein (PABP). The other complex, the eIF2 ternary complex (eIF2-TC), contains eIF2, GTP and the Met-tRNAi. Once formed this complex is recruited to the 40S ribosomal subunit along with eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, and possibly eIF5, forming the 43S pre-initiation complex. The 43S complex then interacts with the eIF4F complex via eIF3 binding to eIF4G to form the scanning competent 43S complex (Fig. 1A). This complex is additionally stabilised by the interaction of eIF4G with PABP and of eIF4B with eIF4A and PABP (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009, Bushell et al., 2001). The scanning model then predicts that the 43S complex progressively scans along the message until a suitable initiation codon is recognised. Although the codon AUG is used primarily as the \u201cstart codon\u201d there are many examples of non-AUG start codons that are used including GUG and CUG (Touriol et al., 2003). Once the start codon is recognised and a 48S preinitiation complex has been formed, joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit occurs to form the 80S ribosome (reviewed by Jackson et al., 2010).",

Thus the availability of eIF4E is dependent on the phosphorylation status of its interacting partners, 4E-binding proteins (4EBPs). When phosphorylated they release eIF4E and this increases the net amount of protein that is able to interact with eIF4G to form the eIF4F complex (Fig. 1B). Signalling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway (PI3K) regulates 4EBP phosphorylation and when activated by growth factors, PI3K phosphorylates Akt, which in turn phosphorylates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) leading to 4EBP phosphorylation and upregulation of translation. Since there is an increase in both the levels and phosphorylation status of translation initiation factors in cancers, drugs that target these pathways such as rapamycin (which targets mTOR) are being investigated as potential therapeutic agents (Blagden and Willis, 2011).",

This protein is comprised of 3 subunits and phosphorylation occurs on the alpha subunit at position Ser51 (Dever and Sicheri, 2007). The phosphorylation of eIF2 inhibits translation since phosphorylated eIF2 binds with high affinity to its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B that is present in limiting amounts. This prevents eIF2 recycling, lowering the amount of eIF2-TC formation, and inhibits translation (Fig. 1C). There are four kinases that phosphorylate eIF2 that are activated by different external stimuli (Spriggs et al., 2010). For example, GCN2 (General control non-de repressible 2) is activated following nutrient starvation and UVB exposure (Powley et al., 2009, Spriggs et al., 2010), PERK (PKR-like ER kinase) is activated when unfolded proteins accumulate in the cell e.g. in prion disease (Moreno et al., 2012), PKR (RNA-dependent protein kinase) is activated during viral infection, but also during the disruption of systemic metabolic homeostasis (Hotamisligil, 2006) and HRI (Haem-regulated inhibitor) promotes survival of erythroid precursors when iron levels are low (Chen, 2007).",

Transcripts with one uORF generally have a 5\u2032UTR of at least 75 nucleotides. The probability that a mRNA will contain more than one uORF increases with the increasing length of the 5\u2032UTR, although the occurrence of upstream AUGs (uAUGs) does not show any correlation with 5\u2032UTR length (Fig. 2\n) (Iacono et al., 2005). Both uORFs and uAUGs occur less frequently than expected by chance implying that they are under negative selection pressure (Calvo et al., 2009, Iacono et al., 2005, Resch et al., 2009). However, the presence of multiple uORFs seems to be enriched in certain subgroups of mRNAs, including genes coding for growth factors, transcription factors and proto-oncogenes (Davuluri et al., 2000, Kozak, 1987a).",

There are some circumstances, which allow the ribosome to skip the first AUG, e.g. if the first AUG is in a sequence context which is not recognised efficiently by the scanning ribosome causing leaky scanning (discussed below) (Kozak, 1986), or if the first AUG is located too close to the 5\u2032 cap (Kozak, 1991). However, uAUGs/uORFs located in the 5\u2032UTR that are recognised by the 40S ribosomal subunit will by default downregulate the translation from the main open reading frame (mORF).

The most favourable nucleotide context surrounding a start codon has been shown to be GCCA/GCCAUGG (termed Kozak consensus) of which A at \u22123 and G at +4 (the A at the AUG codon being +1) are the most important nucleotides (Kozak, 1986, Kozak, 1989b). The Kozak context has been shown to be especially important around the non-AUG start sites (Kozak, 1989a, Peabody, 1989). The A at the \u22123 position was demonstrated to interact with the eIF2\u03b1 subunit and the G at +4 with helix 44 in the 18S rRNA in experiments using UV-crosslinking and purified factors. Both these interactions are proposed to promote AUG recognition at the start site (Pisarev et al., 2006). However, in addition to AUG context, the secondary structure of the transcript, especially following the start site, has been shown to play an important role in start site selection (Kozak, 1986, Kozak, 1991). Interestingly, it has been shown that about 90% of the mORF AUG start sites are either in a strong (both \u22123A/+4G) or adequate (either \u22123 or +4) nucleotide context; there was no likewise \u2018bias\u2019 for the start sites of uORFs (Iacono et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The best understood mechanism of mammalian translational control by uORFs is reinitation on the human ATF4 mRNA. This transcript encodes a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription factor and has 2 uORFs in its 5\u2032UTR of which the uORF1 is only 3 amino acids long and the uORF2 is 59 amino acids long and overlaps with the ATF4 mORF (Fig. 3\n) (Vattem and Wek, 2004). Under normal conditions (eIF2-TC abundant) uORF1 is efficiently translated. Any 40S ribosomal subunits that resume scanning after the uORF1 stop codon will reacquire eIF2-TC before reaching the uORF2 AUG codon and thus reinitiate at uORF2 (Fig. 3A). Because the uORF2 is much longer and more importantly, overlaps with the mORF, the majority of the ribosomes will be recycled at the uORF2 termination codon, leading to repression of the ATF4 mORF. During stress conditions (i.e. ER stress) eIF2\u03b1 subunit phosphorylation is increased which reduces the eIF2-TC concentration. Now, the 40S ribosomal subunits that resume scanning will bypass the uORF2-AUG codon due to the longer time it takes to reacquire eIF2-TC, thus leading to reinitation at the ATF4 mORF (Fig. 3B) (Vattem and Wek, 2004). Interestingly, in the ATF4 and ATF5 transcripts both the uORFs and the nucleotide distance between them are conserved among different vertebrate species that suggests a common regulatory mechanism in these mRNAs (Vattem and Wek, 2004, Zhou et al., 2008).",

The only native uORFs in yeast that have been shown to be permissive for reinitiation are the first uORF in the GCN4 mRNA and the only uORF in YAP1 mRNA (Hinnebusch, 2005, Munzarova et al., 2011, Vilela et al., 1998).

Interestingly, mammalian eIF3 and eIF4F interact directly with each other, and this interaction has been suggested to be important for reinitiation in mammalian systems (P\u00f6yry et al., 2004), but in yeast only an indirect interaction between eIF3 and eIF4F (by eIF1 and eIF5) has been shown (Hinnebusch, 2006).",

Interestingly, the second uORF contains 6 rare codons for either arginine or proline within its 30 codon sequence. This would be predicted to potentially slow down or even stall the ribosome during uORF translation. Indeed, synonymous replacement of the adjacent rare arginine codons in the N-terminus of the peptide with a more abundant codon (either arginine or alanine) alleviated repression (Fig. 4A) (Col et al., 2007). A nucleotide sequence that allowed for RNA secondary structure to form and/or binding motifs within the 5\u2032UTR sequence could also affect uORF behaviour and mRNA translation. For example, the pausing of the ribosome caused by the presence of highly structured RNA could allow increased time to recognise an AUG in a mechanism that could be similar to the way in which pseudoknots are used to achieve frame-shifting in coronaviruses (Roberts et al., 2009). Mutational analysis of the 36 codon uORF inhibitory peptide of UCP2 demonstrated that the uORF C-terminal nucleotide sequence was important for its inhibitory behaviour, although the mechanism is not yet understood (Hurtaud et al., 2006, Pecqueur et al., 2001).",

A more recent peptidomics approach detected 15 uORF peptides (Slavoff et al., 2013). These low numbers suggest that either the majority of uORF products are expressed at levels currently undetectable and/or that they are selectively degraded within cells (Oyama et al., 2007, Slavoff et al., 2013). When uORF peptide expression does occur it may be spatially and/or developmentally regulated. For instance MYCNOT expression, the uORF product of the MYCN\n\u03941b transcript, was detectable within foetal but not adult brains (Besancon et al., 2009). Further confusion arises as to the function of such uORF peptides, with many containing unique domains and motifs (Besancon et al., 2009, Oyama et al., 2007). Differences in subcellular localisation; the 2 uORF peptides of the MKKS gene both localise to the mitochondria, which is in contrast to the cytoplasmic location of the MKKS protein (Akimoto et al., 2012). Or their association with other cellular factors, the uORF2 peptide of the GR transcript variant 1A interacts with a number of proteins in the cytoplasm but not membrane-bound GR (Diba et al., 2001). Collectively, these observations hint at the prospect that uORF peptides refractory to rapid proteolysis may also fulfil roles additional to translational control.",

S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) uORF-mediated repression is regulated by polyamine concentration, which determines the duration of ribosomal pausing at the C-terminus of the uORF sequence, thus obstructing passage of ribosomes to the mORF (Law et al., 2001, Nishimura et al., 1999, Raney et al., 2000). AdoMetDC encodes an inhibitory 6 codon uORF (Hill and Morris, 1992). Detailed molecular studies both in cell and cell-free systems support the hypothesis that the AdoMetDC uORF protein sequence is responsible for this inhibition, with the codon identity at the fourth and fifth positions as well as the length of this peptide being essential for its repressive properties (Hill and Morris, 1993, Mize et al., 1998, Raney et al., 2000). Despite the ability of the AdoMetDC uORF to inhibit a reporter construct in yeast, the peptide shows no sequence similarity to yeast uORFs that likewise promote ribosomal pausing/stalling suggesting these peptides associate with different molecular targets within the ribosome or associated factors (Law et al., 2001, Mize et al., 1998).",

Argininosuccinate synthase (AS) transcripts differ in their 5\u2032UTR length due to the usage of different transcriptional start sites. The major transcripts (present at >90% of all AS transcripts within a cell) contain a short UTR with no uAUG, whereas the longer UTRs of the minor products contain an inhibitory uORF (Pendleton et al., 2002). Transfection of the AS uORF construct into bovine aortic endothelial cells repressed endogenous AS protein expression, with mutational analysis demonstrating that both the uORF peptide sequence and length being essential determinants of repression (Pendleton et al., 2005). Other examples of trans-repression have thus far been demonstrated by the addition of high concentrations of uORF peptides within cell-free systems. These include the mammalian \u03b22 adrenergic receptor uORF peptide sequence, which encodes a number of conserved arginine residues. However, this effect was recreated with an unrelated peptide of equivalent high basic charge, although arginine alone proved insufficient (Parola and Kobilka, 1994). Another example involves the last uORF peptide of Vasopressin V1b receptor (whose endogenous expression has been detected within cells) that was able to re-establish translational inhibition when added exogenously to a cell free system expressing a transcript in which this uORF AUG had been mutated (Rabadan-Diehl et al., 2007). These interesting examples of uORF peptide functionality highlight the important of experimental design and appropriate controls when dissecting out an uORF's behaviour, including the need for consideration of any coexpressed transcript variants.",

Indeed, in the absence of the uORF no truncated product is produced (Calkhoven et al., 1994, Calkhoven et al., 2000). Translation of the full length or truncated products is regulated by changes in the availability of initiation factors.

Therefore up-regulation of CHOP protein requires eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, but is not necessarily dependent on the uORFs. It was suggested that under these conditions the uORF start codons (2 in-frame) become less well recognised by the ribosome complex (Palam et al., 2011). Further support for this theory was shown by mutation of the uORF to a strong Kozak consensus (which would be expected to decrease leaky scanning) reduced CHOP translational upregulation (Palam et al., 2011).",

GADD34 mRNA undergoes both transcriptional and translational upregulation after ER stress. The 5\u2032UTR of GADD34 mRNA contains 2 conserved uORFs that are inhibitory. Derepression after thapsigargin treatment (which induces ER stress PERK activation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation) was reliant on the presence of the second uORF start codon, whereas the first uORF was dispensable (Lee et al., 2009). Similarly, protein kinase C isoform \u03b7 mRNA contains 2 conserved uORFs that are inhibitory to mORF translation, especially uORF2 that has a strong Kozak consensus sequence (A\u22123/G+4). Derepression after amino acid starvation required both GCN2 kinase and the presence of either uORF. Interestingly, mutation of the uORF2 stop codon, so that it now terminated downstream of the mORF start codon had no effect (Raveh-Amit et al., 2009). This implies that it is the start codons of the uORFs that are required and recognised during uORF bypass events, rather than uORF translation.",

            "text": "IRES elements provide a structured RNA context that can recruit ribosomes to initiate translation internally and thus independently from cap-dependent translational events (see review, Pichon et al., 2012). A couple of examples have been demonstrated in mammalian transcripts where translational control involves coordination between an uORF and an IRES element (Fig. 4E). Cat-1 mRNA undergoes IRES-mediated translational upregulation following amino acid or glucose deprivation. Interestingly, translation of a 48 codon uORF is required for maximal IRES activity (Fernandez et al., 2001, Fernandez et al., 2002a, Fernandez et al., 2002b, Yaman et al., 2003). Detailed mutagenesis studies led to a model which predicts that the Cat-1 IRES is in an inactive conformation which is restructured into the active IRES during translation of the uORF. Although, it is not yet fully understood how the uORF is initially translated (as the sequence of the 5\u2032 end of the UTR is inhibitory to ribosomal movement) or how the IRES is maintained in its active context during stress stimulation (Yaman et al., 2003). The VEGF-A gene undergoes a number of transcriptional and translational regulatory steps that give rise to 9 protein isoforms. The presence of 2 IRES elements within the 5\u2032UTR allows translation initiation from either the mORF AUG or from an uCUG codon that produces a N-terminally extended protein that is subsequently cleaved. VEGF-A isoforms arise from differential splicing, with the 121 amino acid isoform, unlike the other commonly expressed 165 and 189 amino acid isoforms, only being translated from the uCUG codon. Interestingly, cap-independent translation of an uORF upstream (situated between the uCUG and main AUG codons) acts to repress IRES-mediated expression of the 121 isoform from the AUG codon. This demonstrates the occurrence of widespread cis regulatory actions between the uORF, the IRES element and downstream RNA sequences (Bastide et al., 2008).",

            "text": "A recent new technology termed ribosome profiling, involves deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, allowing the detection of ribosome occupancy in any given mRNA genome wide. Thus, in principal one can detect which part of the mRNA is translated (Ingolia et al., 2009, Ingolia et al., 2011). By the use of two drugs; harringtonine, which acts by stalling 80S ribosomes at translation initiation start sites, and cycloheximide that arrests elongating ribosomes, the start sites and reading frames of a transcript can be identified. Ribosome profiling in mouse embryonic stem cells revealed high-level ribosome occupancy in uORFs that had non-AUG start codons (Ingolia et al., 2011). In fact the majority of the all uORFs detected had near-cognate start sites of which; CUG was used the most (30\u201335%), GUG and AUG (20%), UUG (15%) and ACG (10%). Many mRNAs had multiple uORFs with both AUG and non-AUG start sites. All these uORFs were accompanied by elongating ribosome footprints, which were detected without harringtonine treatment indicating that the uORFs were actively translated (Ingolia et al., 2011). When ATF4 mRNA was examined, ribosome footprints were found at both start codons and within both uORFs, however no ribosome footprints were observed at the mORF start codon indicating translational suppression. In contrast, in mRNAs containing non-AUG uORFs, ribosome footprints were seen at both the start codons and within the reading frames of non-AUG uORFs as well as at the mORFs suggesting that these non-AUG uORFs might have a weaker regulatory function than uORFs with AUG start codons.",

Due to the limitations of the technology, these peptides were on average 75 amino acids. Interestingly, many of these non-AUG uORFs overlapped the mORF. To validate these findings, the uORF and the adjoining mORF were tagged and expression of both the non-AUG uORF and mORF was confirmed using immunofluorescence. Mutation of the non-AUG to an AUG codon, completely repressed translation of the mORF indicating that the mORF was being translated by leaky scanning (Slavoff et al., 2013). How such non-AUG codons are recognised is not fully understood. However, it has been shown that eIF1 plays an important role in start codon selection and that in the absence of eIF1 the scanning ribosome is unable to discriminate between an AUG and non-AUG codon and is also indiscriminate to the surrounding Kozak context (Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002). More recently, overexpression of eIF1 in cells abolished initiation from non-AUG codons. Furthermore, it was proposed that eIF1 concentration is involved in an autoregulatory feedback loop controlling its own translation, as the mORF AUG codon of the eIF1 transcript is positioned within a poor Kozak context (Ivanov et al., 2010).",

Strictly speaking, changes in isoform abundance in cancer are due to aberrations in transcription. However, as isoforms can differ in both their untranslated regions and coding sequences, they may produce a change to translational potential. MDM2, an oncogene that binds and inactivates the tumour suppressor p53, is encoded by 2 transcripts a short and long version, transcribed from different promoters. Translation from the long transcript is dampened by the presence of 2 inhibitory uORFs, which are absent from the shorter transcript. In human soft tissue tumours overexpression of MDM2 protein can occur from enrichment of the more highly translated short transcript (Brown et al., 1999). Altered promoter usage has also been identified in breast cancers that display reduced expression of the DNA repair gene BRCA1. Increased transcription of BRCA1 transcripts with a longer inhibitory 5\u2032UTR are observed in these cells. The lower translation of the mORF in these transcripts arises from both an increase in secondary structure and the presence of 3 uORFs in the 5\u2032UTR (Sobczak and Krzyzosiak, 2002). In head and neck cancer a change in splicing caused the retention of a longer inhibitory 5\u2032UTR of the tumour suppressor hyaluronidase to be the predominant transcript produced in these cancers. This transcript contains numerous uAUGs that reduced expression of the mORF (Frost et al., 2000).",

Further testing of 5 of these genes by reporter assay confirmed that the loss of the uORFs in all cases lead to increased translational efficiency (Calvo et al., 2009). The examination of SNPs within uORF sequences also needs future consideration. A SNP that creates a missense change within the second uORF of the serotonin receptor gene HTR3A has been significantly linked with bipolar affective disorder.

In hereditary melanoma certain families show a G-T mutation, which creates an uAUG within the Cdk4/Cdk8 kinase inhibitor CDKN2A mRNA. This uORF, which is efficiently recognised by ribosomes, reduces CDKN2A mRNA expression and consequently alleviates its restriction on G1 progression in the cell cycle (Liu et al., 1999). The human hairless gene contains 4 uORFs, but it is the second (and longest) uORF in which a range of mutations has been identified in families with Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis. The mutations identified were either missense or nonsense or removed either the uORF initiation or termination codon, as uORF2 is in-frame with the mORF this would produce an N-terminally extended protein. All tested mutations were shown to enhance translation from a reporter gene. Furthermore, the observation that missense mutations augment translation suggests that the peptide sequence of the uORF2 is important for translational repression (Wen et al., 2009). Enhanced translation of the THPO gene is observed in hereditary thrombocythemia, the 5\u2032UTR of which contains 7 uORFs. One familial mutation involves a nucleotide change that creates a new splice donor site, which eliminates all uORFs from the spliced message (Wiestner et al., 1998). Other mutations affect the seventh uORF, which overlaps with the mORF. The introduction of a nonsense mutation upstream of the mORF, allowed reinitiation by ribosomes after uORF7 translation (Ghilardi et al., 1999). Alternatively, a nucleotide deletion in uORF7, which places it in-frame with the coding sequence, produced a N-terminally extended protein (Ghilardi and Skoda, 1999, Kondo et al., 1998).",

Due to the abundant eIF2-TC availability the 40S ribosome reacquires a ternary complex before uORF2 allowing reinitation at uORF2 AUG codon. Hence, preventing translation of the ATF4 mORF.

(D) Bypass of an inhibitory uORF has been observed under stress conditions and is dependent on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.
