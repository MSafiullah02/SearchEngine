In particular, RNA viruses have become important zoonotic agents originating from wildlife. Studies from the last decades have placed RNA viruses as primary etiological agents of human emerging pathogens, occupying up to 44% of all emerging infectious diseases (ranging from 25% to 44% in different studies), which, along with bacteria (10%\u201349%), overshadow other parasite groups such as fungi (7%\u20139%), protozoans (11%\u201325%), and helminths (3%\u20136%) (Binder et al. 1999; Jones et al. 2008; Morens et al. 2004; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005). RNA viruses have higher probabilities to infect new host species because of their exceptionally shorter generation times and their faster evolutionary rates. The rapid evolutionary rates of RNA viruses build from frequent error-prone replication cycles (Holmes 2009). Mutation rates of RNA viruses can occur\u2014roughly\u2014at rates of six orders of magnitude greater than those of their cellular hosts (Holmes 2009). Moreover, their mutability can even surpass that of some DNA viruses by up to five orders of magnitude (e.g., 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 mutations per nucleotide, per genomic replication [m/n/gr] in the single-stranded RNA phage Q\u03b210, versus 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 m/n/gr in the double-stranded DNA virus herpes simplex virus type 1; Duffy et al. 2008).",

            "text": "RNA viruses are often highlighted as the most common class of pathogens behind new human diseases, with a rate of 2 to 3 novel viruses being discovered each year (Rosenberg 2015). Moreover, Rosenberg suggests that this is a small number of novel viruses discovered each year, and that it is an artifact of inadequate surveillance in tropical and subtropical countries, where even established endemic pathogens are often misdiagnosed. The literature describes the recent emergence of interspecies-transmitted RNA viruses, such as Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, which represent new global pandemics. CHIKV was first well documented in Asia in the 1950s, and it has infected millions (Tsetsarkin et al. 2016) and recently spread to the Americas in 2013 (Weaver and Forrester 2015). It was followed by ZIKV in 2015. Other viruses, in turn, have been known to cause epidemics since early human history, as is the case of avian influenza viruses (Taubenberger and Morens 2010), but they still continue to produce new strains of current concern for human health. Weber et al. (2016) wrote a useful systematic review on five zoonotic, highly communicable RNA viruses including Lassa fever, Ebolavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), SARS, and Influenza A virus (IAV) and described key information on their biology and epidemiology as well as provided control guidance for clinical settings. This type of information is essential towards the proper control of RNA-viral emergent diseases.",

            "text": "RNA viruses show remarkable capabilities to adapt to new environments and confront the different selective pressures they encounter. Selective pressures on viruses not only include their host\u2019s immune system and defense mechanisms but also the current artificial challenges devised by the biomedical community (i.e., antiviral drugs aimed at key viral proteins like HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and Hepatitis B and C virus protease inhibitors). Their peculiar rate of adaptive evolution arises from their exceptionally high mutation rates. Table 1 shows examples of the mutation rates of well-studied RNA viruses including dengue virus (DENV), influenza virus H3N2, and HIV-1 compared to other species of microorganisms, exemplifying the mutation rates of bacteria, fungi, and protozoans. For viruses and bacteria, these rates are usually calculated in vitro from counting the changing proportions of individual cells (or viral particles) expressing a certain phenotype such as drug resistance (Foster 2006; Lee et al. 2012; Schrag et al. 1999). This list in Table 1 is not extensive, because the units of mutation rates are not always comparable; these examples are those from the few studies that coincided for mutations-per-site-per-generation. Still, RNA viruses show much faster mutation rates than the other groups. It must also be acknowledged that mutation rates vary within any taxonomic group; for example, Sanju\u00e1n and Domingo-Calap (2016) reported rates from 27 viruses ranging from 10\u22128 to 10\u22126 nucleotide mutations per nucleotide per infected cell (m/n/c) for DNA viruses and from 10\u22126 to 10\u22123 m/n/c for RNA viruses.\n",

The substitution rates of many of the emergent RNA viruses have been calculated and follow the trend shown in Figure 1. Note that RNA viruses show greater substitution rates than DNA viruses. In spite of the fact that the mutation and substitution rates reflect the evolutionary rate of a biological entity, they are not equivalent (Duffy et al. 2008). The mutation rate is the raw measurement of the number of genetic changes such as point mutations and insertions/deletions that accumulate in time. The substitution rate can be defined as the number of mutations that are fixed per nucleotide site in time; therefore, it is a multifactorial measurement that considers the mutation rate, population size, generation time, and fitness. For a more profound analysis on the fundamental differences between these two evolutionary rates, their calculations, and an extensive comparison between DNA and RNA viruses, please refer to Duffy et al. 2008.\n",

The majority of RNA viral replicases lack proofreading activity. In the case of replicative DNA polymerases of cellular organisms, an exonuclease is one of several proteins that correct the possible nucleotide misincorporations occurring during genome replication. In the absence of an exonuclease domain, the fidelity of the polymerases is determined by the steric constraints of the residues that form the active site. Ultimately, the absence of exonuclease activity increases the point mutation rate of the genome by omitting error correction during the replication process of RNA viruses.",

            "text": "When a correct nucleotide is bound to the active site, many favorable interactions occur. However, the incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide makes replication a less efficient process, the number of polymerase-nucleotide interactions diminishes, and the conformational changes are slower, deforming the catalytic site of the enzyme making the phosphoryl transfer reaction less proficient (Castro et al. 2005; Kunkel 2004). The error rates of viral RNA replicases are similar, albeit a little higher, to those of cellular DNA polymerases when the latter are devoid of their associated proofreading mechanisms. These similarities in error rates point towards inherent limits in terms of efficiency and fidelity in both DNA and RNA polymerases. However, the prerogatives for survival seem to be different. In the case of DNA-based cellular organisms with huge genomes in terms of length and gene content, the presence of multiple proofreading pathways diminishes the burden of random mutations, hence, preserving the genetic identity of the species. Nevertheless, RNA viruses are found at the opposite end, benefiting from mutability. As a matter of fact, RNA viral populations are considered to form quasispecies, that is, a swarm of genetic mutants revolving around a consensus sequence, in a phenomenon also known as \u201cthe survival of the flattest,\u201d implying that viruses with larger numbers of variants of a given sequence (i.e., a \u201cflatter\u201d curve of abundances) will have more probabilities to continue replicating inside the host (Holmes 2010; Lauring and Andino 2010). The RNA viral error rate is at the limit of mutation tolerability, and small increases in this rate generate what is known as mutational meltdown or error catastrophe, in which the viral fitness plummets down, leading to viral extinction (Lauring and Andino 2010; Novella et al. 2014). This principle is at the base of using mutagenic agents such as Ribavirin as antiviral drugs.",

Different experimental conditions and point mutations have proven to alter polymerase fidelity. Higher temperatures (\u00c1lvarez and Men\u00e9ndez\u2010Arias 2014) and lower pH (Eckert and Kunkel 1993) increase fidelity in the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). Different studies, mostly on the Picornaviridae family polymerase, have shown the effects of point mutations in polymerase fidelity. An example of these effects is the G64S mutation in the poliovirus polymerase (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2003). This poliovirus mutant proved to be a high-fidelity variant with less pathogenicity and an attenuated phenotype compared to the wild type (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2003; Vignuzzi et al. 2006). A similar phenomenon was observed with the mutant CHIKV C483Y, bearing a high-fidelity polymerase that produced less genetic diversity and caused attenuated viral infections in newborn mice and mosquitoes (Coffey et al. 2011). However, in other studies, low-fidelity polymerase mutants of Coxackie virus B3, and CHIKV, also demonstrated attenuated phenotypes and lower viral titers (Gn\u00e4dig et al. 2012; Rozen-Gagnon et al. 2014). From the aforementioned studies, we might conclude that viral RNA-dependent polymerases are found at a \u201cpoint of fidelity equilibrium\u201d from which slight changes in any direction show detrimental effects to the viral fitness.",

It is commonly accepted that there is a trade-off between the RNA viruses\u2019 genome length and the high mutation rate: for very long RNA genomes, the number of mutations accumulated during each replication cycle would be so elevated that inviable virions would rapidly outnumber the viable ones, leading to a loss of fitness and/or viral extinction.

Recombination can be intra-genomic when the two segments come from the same origin, that is, the same infecting virus, or inter-genomic when the two segments come from different origins, that is, different viruses infecting the same cell. In the case of segmented viruses, the packaging within a single virion of genomic segments from different progeny viruses is called reassortment (Chetverin 1999; P\u00e9rez-Losada et al. 2015; Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011).",

However, different theories posit that recombination/reassortment may be a secondary consequence of the selection of other viral characteristics and that physical factors such as genome secondary structure may be driving the rate of this phenomenon in RNA viruses (P\u00e9rez-Losada et al. 2015). The presence and the evolutionary role of recombination and reassortment have been demonstrated in the four main groups of RNA viruses; however, the estimated rate of these phenomena among them is highly variable. The virus with the highest recombination rate calculated, as of today, is HIV-1. Each HIV-1 virion contains two copies of the genomic RNA strand (Johnson and Telesnitsky 2010); during the reverse-transcription process, the RT dissociates from the RNA template several times, switching to another RNA strand to use as a template, making a chimeric DNA strand. The in vitro and in vivo estimates of recombination for this retrovirus are of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1.38 \u00d7 10\u22124 recombinations per site per generation (Cromer et al. 2016; Schlub et al. 2014; Shriner et al. 2004). Recombination in HIV-1 has a major impact on the evolutionary history of this virus, and over 60 circulating recombinant forms have been identified in patients around the world. Certain adaptive traits have been associated with circulating recombinant forms, including enhanced biological fitness, increased virulence and pathogenicity, and resistance to antivirals (Vuilleumier and Bonhoeffer 2015).",

For example, it is known that HIV can acquire significant resistance after just a brief exposure to antiretroviral drugs, especially if they are not combined with additional drugs. In fact, certain high-level resistance mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can occur with just one point mutation (Lucas 2005).",

Today, with an opportune diagnostic, adequate access to a variety of drugs, and proper adherence to treatment, the expectancy of life of recently infected persons may be similar to that of the HIV-negative population (Nakagawa et al. 2013). Multidrug approaches have also been used against other RNA viruses like the hepatitis C virus (Mizokami et al. 2015) and the influenza virus (Nguyen et al. 2012; Seo et al. 2013). The working mechanism of multidrug therapy is probabilistic in principle: if a viral particle has a random probability to carry one single genetic resistance (i.e., against one single drug), then its probability to carry several combined resistances should decrease geometrically as the number of drug substances increases in the therapeutic regimen. In fact, a simple study by Weverling in 1998 showed that when using five drugs (instead of the standard three-drug regimen), the median time to reach <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL was 8 weeks shorter than under the standard\u2014three drug\u2014regimen. However, simply increasing the number of drug substances is not a practical solution, because patients under these treatments can develop severe side effects in the long term (Adams et al. 2004).",

The replicative fitness costs of mutations may explain why, in clinical settings, the most resistant strain is not necessarily the most frequent (Koval et al. 2006). Treatment alternatives based on this principle have been proposed. Domingo and Perales (2016) reviewed the therapeutic approach known as \u201clethal mutag\u00e9nesis,\u201d which drives viral elimination through excessive mutations. They describe the use of mutagenic nucleotide analogues that have alternate base pairing properties leading to the induction of mutations. Rivabirin was shown to be a mutagenic purine analogue against poliovirus and may have been curing infected patients\u2014inadvertently\u2014through the mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. Rivabirin has also been suggested as a mutagenic agent against Hepatitis C virus (Cuevas et al. 2009). The potential use of lethal mutagenesis may be restricted, for example, when used against coronaviruses that possess proofreading enzymatic capabilities. The lethal mutagenesis approach needs further development, especially regarding the search of nontoxic mutagens, but it promises to be a viable antiviral strategy.",

For example, Jacque et al. (2002) directed siRNAs against several regions of the HIV-1 genome and demonstrated a reduction of >95% in viral infection. Also, the use of siRNAs significantly reduced lung influenza virus titers in infected mice and protected them from lethal challenge (Tompkins et al. 2004). These therapies are, however, on their early stages of development and still have some difficulties. Chen et al. (2008) stated that a main obstacle to the use of RNA interference (for the treatment of chronic HBV infection) has been the lack of safe and effective delivery of the siRNA trigger molecule. In this regard, some authors have developed special delivery systems; for example, Rozema et al.

            "text": "In some cases, when confronting a \u201cnew\u201d virus (or one for which specific drugs have not yet been designed), the best option is to use known drug substances against other RNA viruses. For example, Lamivudine (a nucleoside-analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor) is used as an antiretroviral drug against hepatitis B and HIV, but during the last EBOV outbreak, it was reported that the treatment with Lamivudine early in the infection resulted in the cure of 13 of 15 patients (Azango 2014). In investigating the tridimensional structure of the EBOV RNA polymerase, J\u00e1come et al. (2015) indicate that certain conserved subdomains in the architecture of these proteins may help to explain the broad antiviral activity of certain nucleotide analogues, even against different types of RNA viruses, including ss(\u2212) and ss(+) RNA genomes. Moreover, Brincidofovir has antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses. They concluded that, while specific drugs against EBOV are yet to be designed, other drugs aimed at the active site of other polymerases might interfere with the functionality of the EBOV RNA polymerase, albeit with less specificity. These considerations highlight the importance of phylogenetic studies of newly discovered viruses; such studies may help to direct emergency therapeutic actions before the design of specific antiviral drugs. Interestingly, although the common ancestry of EBOV and retroviruses is not yet clear, it is known that the L protein of EBOV is homologous to the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 (J\u00e1come et al. 2015). In both proteins, the active site (i.e., the palm subdomain) is highly conserved; ergo, the inhibiting effects of drugs can be expected against both proteins. In this same regard, the development of heterologous vaccines within filoviruses has also been explored: Warfield et al. (2015) demonstrated protective efficacy using EBOV virus-like particles against Ta\u00ef Forest virus, both within the Ebolavirus genus. Although there are not \u201cuniversal\u201d drugs against all RNA viruses, it is possible that certain substances against similar viruses may serve a purpose for preliminary control in an emergency situation.",

It was known that SARS infects cells by binding to an enzyme widely expressed in mammals (i.e., the angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Wong et al. 2004). Because of this, murine and other mammalian animals were readily used as models to test candidate vaccines against SARS. On the other hand, however, the MERS virus binds to the cell surface dipeptidylpeptidase 4, in which the receptor binding domain differs between susceptible and nonsusceptible species (Li et al. 2003). MERS is restricted to primates, camelids, and bats. For this reason, rodents were not useful models, whereas camels, alpacas, and primates did develop infection (Crameri et al. 2016) but are expensive models for vaccine testing. These kind of difficulties can delay the development of vaccines against emerging diseases. Also, the lack of data on immunogenicity, dosing, and safety can hinder progress (R\u00f8ttingen et al. 2017). Faster vaccine developments must be a priority when responding to outbreak emergencies.",

This strategy uses a staged approach in which direct contacts of patients infected with EBOV are grouped into \u201crings,\u201d and each ring is randomized into early (immediate) versus late (delayed by 21 days) inoculation. This design has been used to test the efficacy of the rVSV-vectored vaccine expressing Ebola surface glycoprotein. Henao-Restrepo et al.

Because of this, certain species of bats (Calisher et al. 2006) and bird species (Cui et al. 2014) are being increasingly recognized as major reservoirs for several viruses. Remarkably, it has been reported that bats can serve as reservoir hosts of a greater viral diversity than other host species, for example, rodents (Luis et al. 2013; O\u2019Shea et al. 2014). Such reservoir capabilities of bats may arise, firstly, because of their roosting behavior in large and dense congregations that greatly promote transmission and, secondly, because of their flying capabilities and ample home ranges that potentially allow them to translocate viral strains across large geographic regions. Drexler et al. (2012) suggested a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds. In fact, they placed bats as tentative ancestral hosts to both the major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae). Paramyxoviridae species are responsible for some significant human and domestic animal viral diseases, such as measles, distemper, mumps, parainfluenza, and Newcastle disease.",

Predictive modelling has a great potential for prevention and control strategies (Eisen and Eisen 2011; Fischer et al. 2014; Gao et al. 2016; Wu and Cowling 2011). In particular, remotely sensed environmental factors allow predicting vector/reservoir abundance for large and continuous geographic regions. As an example, through the combination of remotely sensed environmental data and point data of mosquito abundance (from light trap collections), Diuk-Wasser et al. (2006) developed a logistic model for low and high abundance of mosquito vectors of the West Nile virus in Connecticut, United States. Their models predicted high abundances of Culex pipien in nonforested areas, while surface water and distance to estuaries predicted high abundances of C. Salinariu, also, surface water and grasslands/agriculture predicted for Aedes vexans and, finally, seasonal difference in the normalized difference vegetation index and distance to palustrine habitats predicted for Culiseta melanura. An interesting model by Peterson et al. (2003) suggested that spread patterns of the West Nile virus were best explained when including migratory birds as critical long-distance transport agents. Other mathematical models can assess, for example, the population effect of vaccination in domestic animals to prevent the development of zoonotic diseases. Reynolds et al. (2014) found that, after an influenza outbreak in a swine breeding herd, their models predicted a persistently high level of infectious piglets, which was robust even after changes in transmission rates and farm size. Their models also predicted that vaccination did not eliminate influenza after an outbreak.",

Viral strains usually circulate endemically within their natural reservoirs (i.e., enzootically); however, continuous interspecies contact may facilitate the \u201cspill-over\u201d of a viral strain towards other species (i.e., an epizootic event). Therefore, in addition to their wildlife reservoirs, influenza viruses can infect a range of host species that include domestic animals and humans (Webster et al. 1992). The colonization of a new host species may require viral diversification strategies to escape the host\u2019s immune system, and IAV\u2019s ability for gene recombination and its rapid genetic and antigenic evolution enables it to readily adapt to new immunogenic environments, also making vaccination efforts difficult in humans and domestic animals (Webster et al. 2014). Wild migratory waterfowl and waterbirds are the source of viral subtypes antigenically novel to humans (Obenauer et al. 2006). It is now known that the introduction of influenza strains with a novel subtype into human circulation caused both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics due to antigenic shift (Taubenberger and Morens 2010). Antigenic shift refers to a phenotypic change of viral surface antigens due to genetic recombination; novel combinations can be different enough (from the original strains) to avoid the immune memory of previously exposed individuals.",

In fact, molecular analyses show that most IAV strains of subtypes H1 and H3 found in humans were closely related to swine IAV strains (Joseph et al. 2016). Interestingly, ferrets have also been identified as hosts of the recently emerged H7N9 strain (Zhu et al. 2013). Although direct transmission of IAV from wild birds to humans may be rare, there is at least one laboratory-confirmed report of H5N1 contracted through interaction with dead wild swans in Azerbaijan (Gilsdorf et al. 2005). Also, serological evidence of exposure to H5A1 has also been found in Alaskan hunters who interact with dead wild avian specimens (Reed et al. 2014). The recent detection of a 1918-like H1N1 avian virus in wildlife populations has raised concerns about the potential reemergence of a 1918-like pandemic (Watanabe et al. 2014). Joseph et al.

The enzootic transmission cycles of CHIKV in sub-Saharan Africa consist of forest-dwelling mosquito vectors and nonhuman primates as host species (i.e., the sylvatic cycle) (Althouse et al. 2016; Tsetsarkin et al. 2016; Weaver and Forrester 2015). The urban CHIKV cycle affecting humans presumably originated when people living near African forests became infected by bites from wildlife mosquito species such as Aedes furcifer. A. furcifer mosquitoes may occasionally occupy urban niches within villages settled in the vicinity of forests (Diallo et al. 2012). However, a different mosquito species, Aedes aegyptii, better adapted to artificial water containers as oviposition sites and to human blood as its source of nutrients, became globally widespread with human migrations (Powell and Tabachnick 2013). Similarly although more recently, the mosquito A. albopictus has had a history of global expansion facilitated by human migration and trade. As a matter of fact, the introduction of A. albopictus into the United States was reported since the 1980s (Reiter and Sprenger 1987), for which the intercontinental shipment of used tires was, at least, partially responsible. CHIKV epidemics apparently arose when people infected in spillover events from enzootic CHIKV reached a location where populations of domestic mosquitoes and their contact with people were adequate to initiate inter-human transmission (i.e., the urban transmission cycle) (Tsetsarkin et al. 2016).",

The author indicates that arthropod-borne RNA viruses such as DENV, YFV, and CHIKV presumably spill from the sylvatic cycle by infecting people living in the vicinity of natural areas who may ultimately transport the virus to the urban cycle. Thus, viable prevention strategies against spillover events are to reduce the exposure of these human populations to sylvatic vectors and/or to reduce their susceptibility through vaccination. Simple solutions for reduced exposure include the use of bed nets that offer some protection against mosquito bites. In turn, the prospects for developing a vaccine against CHIKV are in fact promising due to the limited antigenic variation of the virus (Weaver et al. 2012). Vaccination campaigns should be preferentially targeted to those people in closer contact with the sylvatic cycles. Weaver et al. (2012) stress the importance of prioritizing the development of vaccines against these vector-borne viruses.",

In the literature, it is suggested that increasing international wildlife trade between countries such as China, Vietnam, and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic may have played an important role in the 2003 SARS outbreak (Bell et al. 2004; Greatorex et al. 2016). According to Greatorex and collaborators, wildlife meat has existed as a dietary component in Lao for many generations, but such practices had remained limited to local subsistence consumption. However, after the economic opening of the country in the early 1980s, wildlife trade \u201cgained momentum,\u201d establishing the onset for the further development of an epidemic. In their observational study, at markets in Lao, Greatorex et al. (2016) identified four relevant risk factors in the zoonotic transmission of wildlife diseases:\nWildlife-human contact. In high-volume markets, the authors found an average daily count of alive (or fresh dead) animals ranging from 22 to 931 animals per day being handled in each market.Trade of animals potentially carrying zoonotic diseases. The authors observed the trade of 12 families of mammals: Muridae (rat species), Suidae (wild pig), Pteropodidae (fruit bats), Sciuridae (tree and flying squirrels), Cervidae (muntjac, sambar), Leporidae (hare), Felidae (leopard cat), Rhinolophidae (insectivorous bats), Viveridae (civets), Herpestidae (mongoose), Hystricidae (porcupine), and Lorisidae (loris), capable of hosting 36 significant zoonoses (including rabies, SARS, leptospirosis, and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex).Poor biosafety. Market personnel showed risky behaviors for food contamination, such as lack of hand washing and cleaning of tables, the practice of selling wildlife alongside other fresh products, and poor market cleanliness in general. These factors represent risks for direct human infection.Potential for human spread of a disease from markets to wider populations. In their study, the majority of high-volume markets were located within large towns or on main roads, facilitating contact with large human settlements. Also, they were able to observe foreigner visitors and license plates from other countries at the markets, suggesting a potential for international spread.",

A well-established rule is that pathogens are more likely to \u201cjump\u201d between phylogenetically related hosts. For example, Streicker et al. (2010) demonstrated that frequencies of interspecies transmission of the rabies virus decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between bat host species. Yet such phylogenetic barrier appears to be less significant for viruses than it is for other pathogens. Davies and Pedersen (2008) studied different pathogen communities (protozoans, helminthes, and viruses) in primates and humans and observed that\u2014for viruses\u2014host phylogenetic distance is less important than geography in explaining pathogen community similarity between hosts. They suggested that geographical overlap between neighboring hosts is more relevant due to the rapid evolution of viral lineages allowing them to \u201cjump\u201d hosts across larger evolutionary distances. Moreover, Holmes (2009) highlights that RNA viruses jump species boundaries more often than DNA viruses, and this likely arises from their differing rates of evolutionary change.",

In this case, quantitative models that account for the localization of human disturbance will undoubtedly help predict future interspecies transmission events. For example, land use gradients may modify the dispersion and genetic evolution of viruses (Zirkel et al. 2011). Zirkel et al. (2011) showed that, in a gradient from tropical rainforest to agricultural land use, the genetic diversity of a newly discovered Nidovirus (Cavally virus) decreased, while its prevalence increased in the mosquito population along the process of spreading into disturbed habitats. In a study with ranaviruses (double-stranded DNA viruses), Price et al. (2016) revealed a significant trend for elevated rates of outbreaks in localities with higher human population density. These patterns were likely explained by anthropogenic translocation of viruses from other countries that stimulated the spread of novel viral strains in densely populated areas (Price et al. 2016). On the other hand, it has been proposed that disease risk and interspecies transmission is lower where ecosystems and trophic chains remain conserved (Ostfeld and Holt 2004).",

            "text": "Interspecies transmission alone, however, is not the only factor to consider for potential pandemics, because a majority of epizootic events result only in \u201cdead-end spillover\u201d infections (i.e., in which the virus cannot establish onward transmission in the human population). Yet some pandemics, for example EBOV (Gire et al. 2014), SARS, and HIV (Ostfeld and Holt 2004), were capable of establishing transmission networks among human hosts; but these are exceptions to the common zoonotic pattern, in which humans can only acquire an infection from animal reservoirs. Geoghegan et al. (2016) presented a very interesting analysis on the virological features that may predict adequacy to human emergence. The authors used a multivariate approach to assess the best predictors for human-to-human transmission. They determined that viruses that induce low host mortality, establish long-term chronic infections, and that are nonsegmented, nonenveloped, and not transmitted by vectors were more likely to be transmissible between humans. In regard to the low transmissibility of vector-borne viruses, Coffey et al. (2008) explained that interspecies transfers in arboviruses may be constrained by their alternating infection of dissimilar hosts, where optimal reproduction in one host may involve a fitness tradeoff for the other. Additionally, in their multivariate study, Geoghegan et al. (2016) found that genomic variables had lower predictive power than the aforesaid virological features. In fact, Holmes (2013) had suggested previously that viral genetic studies would be informative only if it were possible to associate such genetic information with specific phenotypes. Any virus identified with the ability to change host species and successfully establish transmission within the human population should therefore be of special concern. Recent evidence has been published for the sexual transmission of ZIKV (D\u2019Ortenzio et al. 2016; Musso et al. 2015), which poses it as a major public health emergency around the globe. Through mathematical modeling, Gao et al. (2016) suggest that sexual transmission of ZIKV can increase the risk of infection and size of the epidemic as well as prolong the outbreaks.",

Level 1 viruses would be those without current ability to infect humans, present only in wildlife populations, but that may eventually \u201cjump\u201d to humans (as it was observed with SARS, EBOV, and MERS-CoV); of special concern are those found in primate species, but also in bats and birds (R0 = undefined, as the primary case is inexistent). Level 2 viruses are those that infect humans but do not spread in the human population (e.g., Rabies virus; R0 = 0), yet these viruses may eventually acquire the genetic ability to spread amongst humans. It is hypothesized that the HIV-1 M lineage emerged from the only strain of simian immunodeficiency viruses capable to overcome a key host restriction (i.e., the human tetherin) (Sharp and Hahn 2011). Level 3 viruses are those that may occasionally transmit between humans (0 < R0 < 1); for example, a novel Rhabdovirus, the Bas-Congo virus, has shown transmissibility in humans (Woolhouse et al. 2016). Finally, Level 4 viruses are those that spread epidemically amongst humans (R0 > 1); interestingly, arboviral, Level 4 viruses (ZIKV, CHIKV, YFV, DENV) indicate that high-level spread in human populations is linked to carriage by anthropophillic vectors.",

By May 20, 2016, a total of 2420 suspected cases had been reported, including 298 deaths. Thus, a committee convened by the World Health Organization on May 19, 2016 decided that the current epidemic is a \u201cserious public health concern\u201d (Barrett 2016).

The current plan of action (May 2016) of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint includes other viral diseases to be urgently addressed and necessitating further action as soon as possible (i.e., Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, EBOV, Marburg virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Lassa fever virus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley fever virus, CHIKV) (in R\u00f8ttingen et al. 2017).",

In this regard, the work of Hotez (2017) stresses the need for economic and political innovations that run parallel with scientific efforts against emergent and neglected diseases. Hotez proposes a combination of global funds, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, alongside national funds from wealthy countries (G20 nations), which, paradoxically and according to Hotez\u2019s work, account for most of the world\u2019s poverty-related illnesses; this in order to secure sufficient funding for the timely development of adequate monitoring and pharmaceutical response.",

            "text": "Finally, the control of certain RNA viral diseases is also problematic for social reasons; for example, the global control of HIV is currently below expected results, because reaching vulnerable communities is reportedly challenging due to the social stigma against HIV-infected people. In certain circumstances, HIV-positive patients may reject treatment for fear of being seen at the local clinics (Gilbert and Walker 2010) or being targets of discrimination from healthcare providers (Chan et al. 2015; Katz et al. 2013; Stringer et al. 2016) despite the expansion of access to drug therapy. Additionally, the global economic crises have driven general budget cuts in HIV control efforts. These difficulties potentially explain an alarming deceleration of the annual decline of new HIV infections in the past years, with some countries (including Egypt, Mexico, Russia, and the Philippines) having slightly increased rates of new infections (Steel 2016). Unfortunately, disease control is ultimately limited by economic and social constraints. Thus, the design of pharmaceutical substances and surveying techniques must also cope with the feasibility of their implementation at the population level, which involves a complex network of educators and policy and decision makers. It must be acknowledged that it is not only human activities in natural ecosystems but also current budgets, policies, and social knowledge\u2014at the local and global levels\u2014that can determine the progress of an epidemic.",

Not only the unknown viral species in the wild, but also those that have been known for decades\u2014or even centuries\u2014still represent a continuous problem to human and animal health. Their biological diversity and rapid adaptive rates have proven to be difficult to overcome and have stimulated the continuous development of pharmaceutical and medical technology. The technological development specifically designed for the survey and control of RNA viruses must therefore be a research priority. Additionally, the continuous monitoring of viral genetics and phenotypes in wildlife reservoirs is also crucial, as reservoirs may be a constant source of novel pathogenic material for humans. Human activities and policies are possibly the best predictors of the extent and severity of future epidemics. Perhaps the best strategy against RNA viral diseases is to design preventive survey programs that evaluate the most vulnerable sectors and geographic regions. These programs will aid in developing plans that guarantee the existence of sufficient and adequate access to treatment. Finally, conservation policies that control the disturbance of natural ecosystems are also essential.",
