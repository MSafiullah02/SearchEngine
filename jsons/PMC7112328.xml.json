            "text": "For centuries, influenza virus has plagued humankind. While influenza infection typically causes mild\u2010to\u2010moderate illness in healthy individuals, it still results in 30,000\u201340,000 deaths per year in the United States. Those most susceptible to influenza infection are infants, the elderly, and those individuals that are immunocompromised due to HIV/AIDS infection or organ/tissue transplant (CDC, 2006). In extreme cases, such as the 1918 pandemic, it is estimated that 50 million people died as a result of influenza infection (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006). What was unique about this pandemic is that the most susceptible to this disease were young, otherwise healthy, individuals. Since 1918, multiple influenza pandemics have occurred, although none nearly as deadly. Another influenza pandemic is inevitable and much effort is being placed on disease surveillance and monitoring of transmission across species (Pandemic Flu 2007, Subbarao 2007).",

While the transmission rate of H5N1 viruses from birds to humans is extremely low, the case mortality rate in humans is greater than 50% (WHO, 2007). Fortunately, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission is extremely rare (WHO, 2005). It is difficult to predict for how long this will be the case and there is increasing concern that H5N1 viruses will recombine with human viruses. This could result in an H5N1 virus with the capacity for human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and perhaps generate a catastrophic pandemic (Subbarao and Joseph, 2007).",

            "text": "Understanding the ways in which influenza interacts with the host is an important component of preparing for the next pandemic. It is necessary to understand these interactions in order to improve existing vaccines, to develop new and more efficacious vaccines that will provide protection against multiple strains and subtypes, and to develop new antiviral therapeutics (Subbarao and Joseph, 2007). Because of its ability to provide a global view, functional genomics is one of the most useful approaches for studying virus\u2013host interactions. Our laboratory is using functional genomics to study a variety of viruses, including HCV, SIV/HIV, Ebola virus, HSV, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and influenza virus (Baas 2006a, Baas 2006b, Baskin 2004, Fredericksen 2004, Geiss 2000, Geiss 2001, Geiss 2002, Geiss 2003, Kash 2004, Kash 2006a, Kash 2006b, Kobasa 2007, Lederer 2006, Pasieka 2006, Smith 2003a, Smith 2003b, Smith 2006, Thomas 2006, Walters 2006, Walters 2006a, Walters 2006b). This chapter will focus on how microarray technology is being utilized to uncover the mysteries of influenza pathogenesis. We will explore increasingly complex models for studying influenza\u2013host interactions using functional genomics, including cell culture systems, murine models of infection, and nonhuman primates (Fig. 1\n). Finally, we will discuss the promise of using genomics to define molecular signatures of the disease that could lead to the evolution of the microarray as a diagnostic tool.",

In contrast, genes whose regulation was replication independent were grouped representative of the following categories: metallothioneins, cell cycle related, transcriptional regulators, part of the ubiquitin pathway, or cellular kinases (Geiss et al., 2001). Although specific aspects of influenza replication\u2010independent and \u2010dependent events could have been assessed using conventional laboratory techniques, our gene expression studies allowed us to examine numerous gene expression changes at the same time.

In addition to the viruses mentioned above, A549 cells were infected with A/WSN/33 or a recombinant in which the NS1 of A/WSN/33 was replaced with the NS1 from the 1918 virus. We noted that there was greater suppression of interferon\u2010stimulated genes in cells infected with the 1918 NS1 recombinant virus than in cells infected with the parental strain. The host response to A/WSN/33 virus containing the 1918 NS1 was also compared with the response to wild\u2010type A/PR/8/34 and with the A/PR/8/34 NS1 mutant viruses. From these analyses, we determined that the expression of numerous interferon\u2010stimulated genes was anti\u2010correlated between these viruses and A/WSN/33 containing the 1918 NS1. For example, NMI and STAT1 expression were upregulated in cells infected with the A/PR/8/34 viruses but downregulated in cells infected with A/WSN/33 containing the NS1 from the 1918 virus. These studies suggest that the NS1 from the 1918 virus is more adept at suppressing key interferon responses. It will be interesting to use functional genomics to compare the effect of the NS1 from the 1918 virus on host\u2013virus interactions to that of the NS1s from modern day low pathogenicity human influenza viruses and both low and high pathogenicity avian H5N1 viruses. Such comparisons will lend a global view into how different influenza NS1s affect the host response and lead to important observations as to the role of NS1 in influenza pathogenicity (Geiss et al., 2002).",

In initial studies, we infected mice with the lethal, A/WSN/33 stain or with a recombinant of this virus containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus. A recombinant A/WSN/33 virus containing the HA and NA of a contemporary human strain (A/New Caledonia/99) was also included in these studies. Both HA and NA are major virulence factors and HA is the major viral factor against which host antibodies are produced (Lamb and Krug, 1996) and evidence suggests that the HA of the 1918 virus is necessary for transmission (Tumpey et al., 2007). Gene expression profiling was then performed on lungs isolated from these mice. Increased gene expression in the lungs of mice infected with either A/WSN/33 or the recombinant virus containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus was observed at 24 h postinfection. In contrast, relatively few gene expression changes were observed in the lungs of mice infected with the A/WSN/33 recombinant strain containing the HA and NA from A/New Caledonia/33. By 72 h postinfection, gene expression changes were similar between the two infection groups, indicating that the HA and NA of the 1918 virus were sufficient to accelerate the host response to the virus (Kash et al., 2004).",

In support of these findings, Tumpey et al. demonstrated that mice infected with A/Texas/36/91 containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus or with A/WSN/33 containing these genes developed severe lung pathology, including varying degrees of necrotizing bronchitis, alveolitis, and pulmonary edema. Strikingly, there was also an increase in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages in the lungs of these animals. To analyze the importance of these immune cells in the context of A/Texas/36/91 recombinant virus, animals in which neutrophils and/or alveolar macrophages had been depleted were infected with a sublethal dose of the virus. Infected neutrophil\u2010depleted mice had a 60% survival rate. In contrast, all animals in which alveolar macrophages or both alveolar macrophages and neutrophils were depleted died by 9 days postinfection with the recombinant virus (Tumpey et al., 2005b). Taken together, these data emphasize the importance of certain immune mediators in combating infection with a recombinant virus containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus.

These studies, led by John Kash, revealed that genes related to various immune cells, notably NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and T helper 1 (Th1) cells, were upregulated in mice infected with the fully reconstructed 1918 virus as early as 1 day postinfection. These genes were persistently activated in the lungs of r1918\u2010infected mice throughout the course of the experiment (5 days) (Kash et al., 2006b). Key mediators of the immune response to influenza virus are cytokines and chemokines that are responsible for the activation of and recruitment of immune cells into the infected tissue (Julkunen et al., 2001). In agreement with early and persistent activation of immune cells in r1918\u2010infected mice, this same gene expression pattern was observed for genes related to pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as Tnf, Il6, and Ccl5 (Kash et al., 2006b). It is crucial that a delicate balance of immune responses is maintained during infection in order to limit excessive damage to the host. If these responses go unchecked, or are insufficient, it can result in dire consequences for the host (La Gruta et al., 2007). Our data suggest that a hyperactive and persistent host response is associated with the 1918 virus and that this is a key contributor to the high mortality associated with this virus.",

We are also interested in using genomics to examine the effects of H5N1 infection on mice and to determine if there are molecular signatures of disease that are present as a consequence of infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza. In addition, we are taking advantage of the vast repertoire of transgenic and knockout mice available to gain further insight into key regulators of the innate and/or adaptive immune response to influenza infection in general. For example, in collaboration with Michael Gale, we are working to understand the role of the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I), during influenza infection. RIG\u2010I plays an important role in the interferon response to many viruses, including influenza (Foy 2005, Fredericksen 2006, Kato 2005, Kato 2006, Liu 2007, Sumpter 2005, Yoneyama 2005, Yoneyama 2004). We recently examined the gene expression profiles in RIG\u2010I deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with A/PR/8/34. Global gene expression profiles revealed significant differences in gene expression between wildtype and RIG\u2010I deficient MEFs. We are in the process of furthering analyzing data, but preliminary analyses have revealed an important role for RIG\u2010I in the host response to the virus (Loo et al., submitted).",

For example, nonhuman primates can be infected with human influenza strains without prior adaptation and the virus is transmissible between animals. In addition, nonhuman primates and humans are close evolutionary relatives. As a consequence, nonhuman primates are increasingly being utilized to examine influenza pathogenesis, and with the sequencing of the rhesus macaque genome (Rhesus macaque genome sequencing and analysis consortium, 2007), genomic and proteomic resources for working with these animals are becoming progressively more available (Magness 2005, Spindel 2005, Wallace 2007).",

They then determined expression profiles common to all of the diseases using genes that were either up\u2010 or downregulated in patients infected with influenza or SLE. Analyses also demonstrated that the genes whose expression was regulated in a similar manner in both influenza and SLE patients fell into distinct categories such as defense response, interferon induction, and heavy metal binding. Furthermore, the authors were able to determine how many genes related to these processes were expressed in individual patients (Chaussabel et al., 2005).",

The same was found for patients infected with influenza compared to those infected with S. aureus (Gram\u2010positive bacterial infection).

For example, these studies were performed on samples that had been taken from patients that had already been diagnosed with a particular illness and genomic analyses only had to distinguish between a relatively few possibilities. However, in order to be effective in a clinical setting, gene expression profiling will need to provide a high degree of accuracy and overcome numerous confounding factors such as age, race, gender, immune status, and co\u2010infection with more than one pathogen. All of these issues must be addressed before functional genomics can function in disease diagnosis. However, once these challenges have been met, genomic diagnosis may decrease the amount of elapsed time between sample collection and disease diagnosis thereby allowing doctors to treat patients more quickly. This is particularly important for patients presenting with acute infections. Additionally, the use of microarrays in this manner may eliminate the need for patients to undergo certain painful and potentially dangerous diagnostic procedures, such as tissue biopsies.",

Researchers are also utilizing functional genomics to study influenza infections in chickens, but these endeavors are still in their infancy (Degen et al., 2006). It will also be desirable to use functional genomics to examine influenza infection in ferrets. Unlike mice, ferrets can be productively infected with human influenza viruses and ferret\u2010to\u2010ferret transmission occurs. Due to these characteristics, ferrets provide a useful and unique model for influenza infection studies. Unfortunately, genomic studies using ferrets are currently limited due to the lack of ferret nucleotide sequence information. We therefore strongly recommend that the ferret genome be sequenced and that ferret\u2010specific microarrays be developed.",

Of utmost concern, is the integration of the vast amounts of genomics data that is available and has yet to be generated. Among the major obstacles are microarray platform differences, species differences, cell type differences, and annotation differences (Wallace et al., 2006). Data from microarray studies also needs to be integrated with conventional biological approaches and with data that will be obtained from the burgeoning field of proteomics.
