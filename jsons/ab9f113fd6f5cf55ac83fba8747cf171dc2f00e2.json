In this chapter, we discuss functional roles for alveolar epithelial cells with particular emphasis on intercellular junctions and communication. As a thin layer of cells directly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, alveoli are particularly sensitive to oxidant insults. Alcohol signifi cantly diminishes the normal antioxidant reserves of the alveolar epithelium, thereby rendering it sensitized for an exaggerated damage response to acute and chronic injuries. The effects of alcohol on alveolar epithelia are discussed along with open questions and potential therapeutic targets to prevent the pathophysiology of alcoholic lung disease.",

Studies in the intact animal have demonstrated that rats on a chronic alcohol diet have enhanced permeability to small molecules (e.g., inulin) as well as to proteins as large as serum albumin [ 22 ] . Moreover, their ability to resist a saline challenge is impaired. Understanding this at a molecular level has benefi ted from the observation that the \"alcoholic lung\" phenotype of alveolar epithelial cells isolated from alcohol-fed rats persists in culture. In other words, alveolar epithelial cells isolated from alcohol-fed rats and grown in monolayers in culture remain leakier than comparably isolated and cultured cells from control-fed rats [ 22 ] . The basis for this is not fully understood, but it is likely that alveolar epithelial cells differentiate in response to chronic stress in the alcoholic lung and that this results in epigenetic modifi cation to genomic DNA that modifi es the behavior of these cells [ 23 ] . Epigenetics is a nascent fi eld in alcohol research and is only beginning to be explored [ 24 , 25 ] . Given the persistence of the alcoholic lung phenotype, alveolar epithelial cells from alcohol-fed rats provide a valuable model system to study their pathophysiology.",

Tight junction permeability is primarily mediated by proteins known as claudins that span the membrane bilayer four times and have both the N-and C-terminal domains oriented inside towards the cytosol. The C terminus of claudins interacts with cytosolic scaffold proteins, most notably zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and ZO-2 [ 27 ] . ZO-1 and ZO-2 in turn link claudins to the actin cytoskeleton. While almost all claudins interact with ZO-1 and ZO-2, they differ in the extent of actin association, which correlates with incorporation into functional tight junctions. Other transmembrane proteins also regulate tight junction assembly and stability, particularly occludin and tricellulin [ 28 ] . Roles for these proteins in the alveolar epithelium are continuing to be elucidated. However, occludin and ZO-1 expression are both down-regulated by the alveolar epithelium in response to alcohol, consistent with the concept that an early and primary defect in the alcoholic lung is impaired alveolar epithelial barrier function [ 29 , 30 ] .",

Of these, 97 % of claudin mRNA in both type I and type II cells encodes for claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-18 [ 31 ] . However, type II cells express signifi cantly more claudin-3 than is expressed by type I cells. This difference has functional ramifi cations, since claudin-3 expression increases alveolar tight junction permeability whereas claudin-4 makes tight junctions less permeable ( Fig. 8. 3 ) [ 32 ] . One consequence of this difference is that type II-type I cell interfaces are enriched for claudin-3 and are therefore likely to be more permeable than type I-type I cell interfaces. Functionally, the unique permeability of type II-type I cell junctions might provide a paracellular pathway for ion and fl uid diffusion that counterbalances ion fl ux due to channel activity (see below).",

This is in line with other studies demonstrating that reactive oxygen species have the capacity to increase ENaC and lung fl uid clearance [ 43 , 44 ] . Together, increased ENaC and Na,K-ATPase in the alcoholic lung provide a pathway for up-regulated fl uid clearance that can compensate for deficits in barrier function induced by dietary alcohol. Studies to date have focused on sodium transport; chloride transport must also increase in order to retain electronic neutrality across the alveolar epithelium. Whether this occurs via up-regulation of chloride channels or by chloride transport via the paracellular route remains an open question [ 40 ] . Taken together, these observations explained an initial paradox when the phenotype of the alcoholic lung was fi rst being examined experimentally. Specifi cally, if chronic alcohol ingestion causes such signifi cant defects in alveolar epithelial permeability, why don't alcoholics have pulmonary edema at baseline? The marked up-regulation of active fl uid transport mechanisms in the alcoholic lung appear to compensate for the increased paracellular permeability and maintain a relatively \"dry\" airspace. However, this new equilibrium is far more susceptible to the stresses imposed by acute infl ammation such as pneumonia or sepsis, and the alcoholic lung is far more prone to alveolar fl ooding with proteins and fl uids during critical illness.",

However, if alveolar barrier function is further impaired due to a second hit, e.g., sepsis or barotrauma, the lung requires an additional increase in sodium transporters in order to prevent alveolar edema. ENaC in the alcoholic lung does have some additional capacity for further up-regulation (e.g., in acute response to endotoxin [ 42 ] ). However, it is clear that lungs of injured alcohol-fed animals are more susceptible to endotoxin and sepsis induced lung edema than non-alcohol-fed controls [ 2 , 18 ] . This suggests that in the alcoholic lung, fl uid clearance saturates at a level insuffi cient to compensate for barrier dysfunction which, in turn, exacerbates the severity of ARDS. Therefore, any treatment modality designed to prevent alcohol-associated ARDS must address alveolar tight junctions, since it is not likely to be possible to increase fl uid clearance enough to prevent alveolar fl ooding.",

A direct mechanism for the effect of alcohol on gap junctions is by partitioning into membranes and changing the connexin microenvironment [ 56 ] . Hormones induced by chronic alcohol ingestion can also have deleterious effects on alveolar gap junctions. Most notably, TGF-\u03b2 inhibits alveolar Cx43 expression [ 55 ] . Moreover, glutathione depletion and increased oxidant stress induced by chronic alcohol (1) of either calcium or inositol trisphosphate (IP3) generates increased cytosolic calcium in type II cells, which, in turn, could stimulate surfactant secretion either through protein kinase C activation or through a direct effect of calcium on lamellar body fusion. Increased cytosolic calcium can also be mediated through secretion of ATP through P2X7 receptor-mediated pannexin channels (2) acting on P2Y2 purinergic receptors. Protein kinase A activation through stimulation of A2 purinergic receptors by ATP can also occur (3). Adapted from [ 46 ] exposure also decrease gap junctional communication [ 57 , 58 ] . Although a reduction in gap junctions in response to oxidant stress reduces intercellular signaling, it can be benefi cial since it decreases the transfer of toxic agents and thus minimizes tissue damage [ 59 , 60 ] .

This interaction was particularly critical for preventing cell injury due to insuffi cient mitochondrial function. In part, this could be due to direct transfer of metabolites from healthy BMSCs to damaged type II cells. More provocatively, evidence was provided showing direct mitochondrial transfer from the BMSCs to the type II cells, which also appeared to require functional gap junctions. Gap junction permeability is too limited to enable direct movement of mitochondria through channels themselves. Instead, mitochondrial transfer was due to microvesicles that were taken up by type II cells. It is plausible that this gap junction plaque endocytosis could enable mitochondrial transfer since, during this process, the plasma membrane and a small amount of cytosol are taken up by the neighboring cell [ 62 ] . Regardless of the specifi c mechanism, if a mitochondrial transfer pathway is critical for ameliorating lung injury then it is likely to be adversely affected by alcohol, which impairs both gap junctional communication (see above) and mitochondrial function [ 63 ] .",

Thus, ATP stimulation of P2X7 receptors induces additional ATP release, acting as a feed-forward loop to further amplify purinergic signaling. Consistent with this, cocultures of type I and type II cells are more sensitive to stretch-induced surfactant lipid secretion than type II cells in monoculture [ 67 ] . The enhanced lipid secretion by cocultures was due to the sensitivity of type I cells to mechanical stimulation. In response to ~20 % stretch, type I cells released fourfold more ATP than type II cells.

Surfactant lipid synthesis, secretion, and function are all impaired by chronic alcohol ingestion in rats as a result of glutathione depletion [ 17 , 18 ] . Procysteine administered as a redox protective strategy restored the ability of type II cells to produce functional surfactant. Interestingly, N -acetyl cysteine was ineffective, since it can only compensate for cytosolic glutathione, whereas procysteine can also replenish mitochondrial glutathione [ 17 ] . Exposure to alcohol in utero also has a negative impact on production of several surfactant lipids, indicating that oxidant stress can occur in the absence of atmospheric oxygen [ 91 ] . This is signifi cant, since it suggests that pulmonary complications are a likely complication of fetal alcohol exposure, particularly in preterm infants [ 92 ] .",

Hallmarks of the alcoholic lung are similar to changes that occur during lung injury; however they are more limited in scale. Therefore, as previously mentioned the otherwise healthy alcoholic has no clinically detectable evidence of alveolar dysfunction. However, these phenotypic changes predispose the alveolus for an exaggerated response when subjected to the added injury of a \"second hit\" such as ventilator-induced lung injury or sepsis.",

Most of the effects of alcohol on pulmonary surfactant diminish the surface active lipid component rather than the protein component. However, when coupled with the added impact of alcohol on host defense, even a small effect on collectin family surfactant proteins is likely to be amplifi ed. Given diffi culties in using surfactant augmentation therapy in adult lung injury [ 107 ] , it seems likely that the best approach is to target improving the immune response or attenuating infl ammation rather than directly manipulating the surfactant pool in the adult alcoholic lung.",

As discussed earlier, increased fl uid clearance can compensate for some defi ciencies in alveolar tight junctions. However, the capacity for up-regulated fl uid clearance is not unlimited. Progress in understanding how alcohol affects the expression and assembly of alveolar tight junctions has identifi ed several potential therapeutic targets to improve alveolar barrier function. Given that alveolar tight junctions are remodeled in response to alcohol, this suggests that a successful therapeutic approach targeting the alveolar epithelium may require normalizing tight junction protein composition. Alternatively, given the profound effects of alcohol that diminish tight junction stability, pharmacologic approaches to stabilize incorporation of claudins into tight junctions may prove to be a useful approach to minimize alveolar fl ooding due to barotrauma.",
