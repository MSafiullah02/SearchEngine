By positive cases, we mean the positive cases actually diagnosed plus, for future days, the positive cases that we expect to be diagnosed. Indeed, it is well known among the virologists that the actual number of positive cases is much higher than the diagnosed ones [4]. However, it is assumed that the diagnosed cases are a good statistical representation of the entire population of the positive cases. In Fig. 1, we report the result of our fit of the cumulative diagnosed positive cases in China. We have then applied such a CDF to study the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy, in the attempt to possibly, statistically, predict the peak in the number of daily positive cases and the possible date of a substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases. Furthermore, we have also applied our method to the CDF of the number of fatalities in both China and Italy, confirming our predictions obtained with the cumulative positive cases. Finally, in Sect. 4, we have performed a number of Monte Carlo simulations to get a more robust prediction of both the date of the peak in the number of positive cases, diagnosed each day, and in the date after which the number of new positive cases will be below a certain threshold [5].",

Figure 3 shows the fit of the data from February 15, 2020, to March 29, 2020. According to this fit, the flex, i.e., the point where the second derivative of the fit is becoming negative, that is, the difference between two successive daily cases becomes negative, or in other words the point where there is a deceleration in the number of positive cases is reached at March 25, 2020, plus or minus 2 days (2-sigma), this uncertainty is derived in Sect. 4. According to this fit, the date of a substantial reduction in the number of cumulative positive cases in Italy (about 100 cases), is April 22, 2020, plus or minus 4.6 days (2-sigma) (see Sect. 4).",

The results are shown in Fig. 4. The analysis of the curve shows that the flex and the number of a substantial reduction in the number of fatalities (about 11 fatalities, i.e., approximately proportional to the threshold of 100 positive cases, chosen in the previous analysis, times the ratio of fatalities to positive cases) are both only four days after the previous predictions, thus confirming the consistency of our results using the positive cases.",

The first one is to fit the cumulative diagnosed positive cases in Italy using the data from the beginning, February 15, 2020 (included), to March 16, 2020 (included), then from February 15, 2020, to March 17, 2020, and so on, until March 29, 2020 (included), thus getting 14 evaluations of the date of the flex. We then evaluated the standard deviation of these 14 points, and we obtained a 1-sigma standard deviation for the flex of 3 days. The 2-sigma (95.5% probability) and 3-sigma (99.7% probability) uncertainties in the day of the flex are then 6 days and 9 days, respectively. In regard to the date of a substantial reduction in the number of cumulative positive cases in Italy (about 100 cases), the standard deviation is 6 days (68.2% probability), 12 days (95.5% probability) and 18 days (99.7% probability). Both the date of the flex and the date of a substantial reduction in the number of cases have a quasi oscillating behavior whose amplitude is decreasing by increasing the final date of the analysis, i.e., increasing the number of points used in the fit. Indeed, using the last seven evaluations out of the 14 ones, the previous standard deviations reduce by a factor of about two. However, using a second more robust method, by a Monte Carlo analysis [8\u201310], we evaluated narrower uncertainties for the day of the flex and for the day of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed positive cases, as described in Sect. 4.",

This error should describe the uncertainty in the process of measuring the daily number of positive cases due to fluctuations in the measurement procedures (such as a different number of performed daily nasopharyngeal swabs of one day with respect to another day); of course, this error does not describe the difference between the actual total positive cases and the diagnosed ones which can be very large [4]. However, the diagnosed cases are hypothesized to be a representative sample of the actual population (i.e., of the total number of positive cases, which is unknown). To get an estimate of the uncertainty in each daily number, we applied the following heuristic approach. We have assumed a measurement uncertainty in the total number of positive cases equal to 10% of each daily number (Gaussian distributed).",

            "text": "In this paper, we considered the first 44 days for fitting the cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in Italy (i.e., from February 15, 2020, to March 29, 2020) and the first 41 days for the Monte Carlo simulations. The function used for the fitting is of the type of the Gauss error function with four parameters (a distribution function which well fits the corresponding cumulative diagnosed positive cases in China). We obtained that the day of the flex (i.e., the day of deceleration in the number of daily positive cases) is in Italy, with a 95.4% probability, between March 23, 2020, and March 27, 2020; the 2-sigma uncertainty of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$+/-$$\\end{document}+/- 2 days was obtained with Monte Carlo simulations. In regard to the day of a substantial reduction in the number of daily positive cases (which, for example, we took to be 100), this day will be in Italy, with a 95.4% probability, between April 17, 2020, and April 27, 2020; the 2-sigma uncertainty of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$+/-$$\\end{document}+/- 4.6 days was also obtained with the Monte Carlo simulations.
