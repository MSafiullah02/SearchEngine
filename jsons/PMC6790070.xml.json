            "text": "In recent years, the study of dynamical processes on complex networks has received significant attention in the mathematical modeling of epidemics [1,2]. There exist three distinct approaches to modeling epidemic spread as a dynamical process on networks. In the first, each node is allowed to change its state with no evolution of the underlying network structure through time, while in the second the network structure coevolves with the state of the nodes [3,4]. A third and more complex approach involves combining the inherent (disease-independent) evolution of social networks with the epidemic dynamics [5\u20138]. The second approach is more realistic for modeling epidemic spread in cases where the state of being infected influences the presence of contact over which the infection can spread. Pragmatically, the details of the network evolution incorporate potentially several social processes. It is a common observation that healthy individuals avoid contact with individuals suffering from an infectious disease. A recent study shows that humans can identify sick individuals through olfactory-visual cues; furthermore, the human immune system appears to use these cues to motivate healthy individuals to avoid contact with infective individuals [9], reducing the risk of contagions and increasing the biological fitness. Another mechanism that leads to the severing of ties between healthy and infective individuals is the practice of quarantine, often enforced by public health agencies to stop the spread of communicable diseases. Such a preference in attachment between individuals changes the social network and thus influences the spread of the infection. Studying this interplay between the infection spread and the coevolving network structure has the potential to provide insights into the processes of disease spread.",

For instance, Ref. [16] shows that clustering in networks could raise the epidemic threshold and degree correlations can alter the epidemic size. However, results obtained using static network models ignore effects due to the underlying social networks evolving in response to the spread of a disease. Coevolutionary network systems, also called adaptive networks, model the dynamics of node states (e.g., susceptible vs infected) together with rules for rewiring network edges in response to the observed states, providing a more general setting to model disease dynamics. Numerous studies have explored different aspects of the interplay between coevolving networks and epidemic spread [19,20], including extensions to signed networks [21]; nevertheless, a variety of open problems and challenges still exist despite increased understanding of coevolving systems [22\u201324].",

            "text": "A common problem across many coevolving network systems is that they often employ edge rewiring rules that ignore transitivity, a fundamental structural property of most networks, wherein friends of friends are more likely to be friends. For example, the typical random-rewiring rule would randomize any given network and destroy most closed triangles present in the initial conditions; this rule is very unlikely to create new triangles in the network and yields a trivial transitivity level corresponding to that expected under edge independence assumptions. Some recent attempts have been made to explore the influence of transitivity in coevolving voter models [25\u201327]. However, the effect of transitivity on coevolving network epidemics remains unstudied, despite the known importance of transitivity in the static network setting.",

            "text": "In this paper we introduce an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on a coevolving network which incorporates a rewiring rule that reinforces transitivity similar to that employed in [26,27]. The most straightforward strategy to deal with an infectious disease is to sever all the links between susceptible and infected individuals. However, humans are social animals and need a certain amount of social relationships to function. Therefore, only discarding the infected-susceptible links without compensation is not pragmatic in all settings. Under the mechanism considered here, susceptible individuals break links to their infected neighbors, rewiring those links to either a random individual in the network or a neighbor's neighbor. The latter rewiring will lead to reinforcement of transitivity (increased clustering coefficient) in the system. While transitivity is a critical property of social networks, studies of epidemic dynamics on coevolving networks have mostly neglected this property. Our model thus provides an opportunity to study the role of transitivity in epidemic dynamics in coevolving network systems. This rewiring rule includes a parameter that governs the preferential rewiring to close triangles. We study the impact of this transitivity reinforcement on the spread of the infection and on the details of the network using numerical simulations of the process as well as an approximate master equation framework (see [28,29]). In Sec. II we describe our model and in Sec. III we present results obtained through numerical simulations, highlighting the dynamical features observed in the model. In Sec. IV we present a derivation of our semianalytical method, confirming results obtained from numerical simulations. Sections III and IV also include identification and analysis of bifurcations in the system dynamics. We conclude in Sec. V with further discussion.",

Infected individuals infect each of their susceptible neighbors at rate \u03b2 while recovering (change to susceptible) at rate \u03b1.

Otherwise (i.e., with probability 1\u2212\u03b7) the rewiring is made to another susceptible node selected uniformly at random from the network outside its immediate neighborhood [that is, self-loops and repeated links (multiedges) are prohibited]. Under the latter situation, uniform rewiring, there remains nonzero probability of randomly picking a neighbor of a neighbor, but this probability becomes vanishingly small for larger networks. In the event that there is no available susceptible node to rewire to (e.g., there are no distance-2 susceptible nodes), the rewiring attempt fails and the original link to the infected neighbor remains. Importantly, rewiring to a neighbor's neighbor closes a triangle between the three nodes, directly reinforcing transitivity, whereas rewiring uniformly at random tends to decrease transitivity.",

We observe that at large enough time t, the system approaches a statistically stationary state with features of interest such as the clustering coefficient and disease prevalence fluctuating around mean values. For the purposes of identifying this state numerically, we determine the stationary state to be reached when the level of disease prevalence I (expressed as a fraction of nodes) between two consecutive integer times differs by at most 10\u22125. Under this definition, we find that in practice networks with the above three initial degree distributions reach their stationary states before t=5000 for \u03b7<1. In contrast, when \u03b7=1 we do not observe convergence to stationary states, even after a long time; rather, we appear to have a long, progressively slowing decay of the disease prevalence (as we will see below in Fig. 8).",

            "text": "To highlight the main differences between our model and previous work without reinforced transitivity [34], we first confirm that our model leads to nontrivial transitivity. We explore two closely related measures of transitivity here. The first measure is the average local clustering coefficient C=1N\u2211i=1NCi, where the local clustering coefficient Ci of vertex i is Ci=Ti/\u03c4i, with Ti and \u03c4i the number of closed triplets (triangles) and the total number of triplets centered at vertex i, respectively [35]. The second measure is the transitivity T (often called global clustering coefficient) [36], defined as T=3T/\u03c4, where T and \u03c4 are, respectively, the total number of closed triangles and the number of triplets in the network. Figures 1(a) and 1(c) show the temporal evolution of the average local clustering coefficient C and the transitivity T in our model, with varying \u03b7 from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.2, keeping all other parameters fixed and choosing the initial degree distribution to be Poisson. When \u03b7=0, there is no reinforcement of transitivity, i.e., C\u22480 (T\u22480) for all time and we are in the same regime studied in Ref. [34]. For nonzero \u03b7, the clustering coefficients rapidly increase and then slowly converge to nonzero values, except in the case \u03b7=1, where we do not observe this convergence, and C (as well as T) appears to continue to grow with a diminishing rate. We treat \u03b7=1 as a special case in our model and will study this case separately later. We also explored the influence of initial degree distributions on the final clustering coefficient. In Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) we observe that networks with the regular degree distribution initially achieve higher clustering coefficients compared to networks with the other two initial distributions. Moreover, networks with initial Poisson and truncated power law degree distributions show indistinguishable final clustering coefficients for \u03b7<1. Finally, in Fig. 2 we examine the local clustering coefficient C grouped by susceptible nodes S and infected nodes I at time t=5000 for networks with Poisson degree distributions initially and with different values of \u03b7. As \u03b7 increases, susceptible nodes typically achieve higher values of local clustering coefficient C compared to the infected nodes.\n\n",

The phase diagram in Fig. 3 indicates that for large enough \u03b3 the system eventually becomes disease-free, presumably because susceptible nodes can easily rid themselves of infected neighbors by rewiring these edges, thus effectively quarantining the infection. When \u03b3=0, there is no rewiring process, the network does not change, and hence \u03b7 has no effect. A more interesting behavior occurs for \u03b3\u22720.05, with large values of disease prevalence that depend on \u03b7 in a complex manner. Since this parameter regime is most interesting for our present study, in the rest of our simulations we fix \u03b3=0.04 and vary \u03b7 to investigate the influence of transitivity reinforcement.\n",

The moment-closure frameworks of pair approximation (PA) and approximate master equations (AMEs) have both been used effectively in similar settings [1,28,37]. In PA, the different counts of contact pairs are used to approximate the density of triplets, thus closing the system of equations [28]. In contrast, the AME framework considers the populations of nodes according to their state, degree, and the states of their immediate neighbors, approximating other quantities from these populations. The AME is an annealed mean field approximation that deterministically approximates stochastic systems. We note in particular that with the additional variables and corresponding differential equations in AMEs, the triplet counts are precisely accounted for (cf. the closure approximations necessary to obtain triplet counts in PA) and that the AME typically provides a more accurate approximation of such dynamics and can be highly stable around the critical point of the dynamics [1,28,34,37,38] (see also [28,37,39] for comparisons between the AME and PA). We note that Ref. [38] further extended this approach to classify links according to the states, numbers of neighbors, and numbers of infected neighbors at both ends of the links. This link-based approach can further improve on the accuracy of the AME method; however, it increases the system size from O(kmax2) to O(kmax4) equations, where kmax is the maximum degree. As such, we restrict our attention here to the AME method.",

Supposing the center node is of class S(k\u22121)l, then it has lk\u22121 proportion of its neighbors infected neighbors, and we describe the number of SI edges among them as IS12II+ISSIS, making assumptions about independence to close the equations with this approximation. Similarly, the same center node class S(k\u22121)l has k\u2212l\u22121k\u22121 proportion of its neighbors susceptible, with the number of SI edges among them described by 12SS12SS+SISIS.

We compare simulation and AME results in Fig. 8, illustrating one of the critical features of our model: the disease prevalence decreases with increasing \u03b7. That is, we observe that systems with a stronger preference for transitivity have smaller numbers of infected individuals, all else being equal. The thick lines in Fig. 8(a) for the AME results accurately capture the final disease prevalence and roughly describe its temporal evolution for \u03b7<0.8. For 0.8\u2264\u03b7\u22641, the AME underestimates the stationary disease prevalence I but still captures qualitative features of the evolution. Remarking again that \u03b7=1 is a special case, we note that the system does not reach a well-defined stationary state in our simulations, with I continuing to decrease. In Fig. 9 we further explore the temporal evolution of I when \u03b7=1 while varying \u2329k\u232a from 2 to 10. We identify a slow power law decay in I for \u2329k\u232a=2; using the curve fitting in matlab\u00ae, we find that the disease prevalence I for \u03b7=1 and \u2329k\u232a=2 scales as I=1.9t\u22120.173 (also shown in Fig. 9), with I appearing to slowly approach a disease-free state. As the mean degree increases, the observed decay with t becomes even slower, to the point that we cannot claim anything about the functional form of the long-time decay from the figure; nevertheless, we provide power law fits to the late times in the figure for comparison. Although the AME prediction for the temporal evolution for \u03b7=1 is qualitatively very different, it does appear to predict a correct I\u221e=0 disease-free stationary state (see Fig. 8).\n",

As in previous figures, markers are simulations and lines are AME results, which appear to be in good agreement. Different colors represent different values of \u03b7, with the interesting result that \u03b7 appears to have only a small effect on the total stationary degree distribution, even though we have seen before that \u03b7 does affect the disease prevalence. Indeed, for both the initial Poisson and truncated power law cases, the stationary degree distribution appears to be close to Poisson with mean degree \u2329k\u232a=2 [see the thick gray line in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b)]. This observation implies that the stationary states resulting from this process have both a Poisson degree distribution and nonzero transitivity. We recall that the model includes two kinds of rewiring: at random to any susceptible node and to a distance-2 neighbor. Neither of these has direct preference to rewire to vertices with a particular degree, except that rewiring to a distance-2 neighbor cannot rewire to a singleton. That is, both rewiring mechanisms are essentially similar to random rewiring in ignoring node degree, which leads to a Poisson degree distribution. Hence, we expect the initial degree distributions to converge to Poisson-like distributions in stationary.\n",

Fixing the average degree, the final disease prevalence level appears to be almost constant across network sizes. Nevertheless, we note that the \u03b2 values considered in Fig. 15 are clearly above the transition between disease-free and endemic cases, though the \u03b2 used with \u2329k\u232a=4 in Fig. 15(b) is much closer to the transition than that in Fig. 15(a). Combined with Fig. 14, where the susceptibility \u03c7 and phase transition seem to not depend on the network size, these findings suggest that, in general, the stationary disease prevalence level I\u221e does not change appreciably with the size of the system here. While we acknowledge that the precise details in and immediately around the transition in \u03b2 might be expected to be more sensitive to system size, such an exploration would involve an even more intensive numerical investigation simultaneously considering variations in N, \u03b2, and \u03b7.

To supplement the phase diagram, in Fig. 16(b) we plot the numerically computed derivative of disease prevalence along the \u03b2 direction, dI\u221e/d\u03b2, observing only a narrow range with a large positive value near the transition points apparent in Fig. 16(a). Also, the jump in dI\u221ed\u03b2 occurs at a lower \u03b2 as \u03b7 increases, again showing the dependence of the transitions on \u03b7. Finally, when \u03b7=1, we see no jumps of I\u221e when \u03b2 varies, further suggesting that the system behavior at \u03b7=1 might be qualitatively different.

Instead of using a fixed value of \u03b5 (we recall \u03b5=0.1 in Figs. 14\u201316), we consider \u03b5 to be 0.001, 0.01, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.99, and 0.999. We run simulations to t=10000 and once again observe stationary states for \u03b7<1. In Fig. 17 we show that the AME predicts the disease prevalence curves for the three different initial degree distributions. Figure 17 also illustrates the effect of \u03b5 on the system. For example, in the degree regular case, the infection becomes endemic only for \u03b5>0.1, whereas in the truncated power law case every \u03b5 leads to an endemic state. In contrast, the Poisson case is more involved: The system appears to be bistable, with larger \u03b5 yielding an endemic infection and smaller \u03b5 typically reaching a disease-free state. Even so, we note that the \u03b5=0.001 points in the figure include points on both the disease-free and endemic branches for the Poisson case.",

We performed 30 Monte Carlo simulations for this \u03b5, finding that 80% of the networks lead to a disease-free state for the Poisson initial condition; on the other hand, 60% of the networks lead to a disease-free state for the truncated power law initial condition. We observe that when \u03b5 is small enough, the system can converge to either an endemic or disease-free state. The AME is unable to predict this bistability from a fixed \u03b5. However, in the cases where the system exhibits only one type of stationary state, then our AME system gives a good prediction of the stationary disease prevalence I\u221e. In the degree regular case [see Fig. 17(c)], there is an additional horizontal line indicating that the AME can capture the state when I\u221e=0 for \u03b5\u22640.1. In Fig. 17 there is greater variability near \u03b7=1 because the system does not converge to a stationary state for the simulated times.

This success of the AME further supports its use to study a variety of binary state dynamics on coevolving networks, accurately predicting properties of large networks at a manageable computational cost. We remark that the high AME accuracy observed here for nonzero \u03b7 may be surprising, in that a key assumption of the AME method is that the networks are locally treelike, but this assumption will seemingly become less valid as local clustering increases with increasing \u03b7. Nevertheless, our AME method appears able to provide good predictions; the possible reasons for such accuracy remain a potential area for future exploration. (See, e.g., Ref.
