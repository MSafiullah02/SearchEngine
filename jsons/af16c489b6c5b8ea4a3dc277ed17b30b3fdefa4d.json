Despite its much greater sensitivity and specifi city than plain fi lm radiography (Heussel et al. 1999 ) , computed tomography (CT) has not been recommended for the initial assessment in most cases. It must be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of infection with normal, ambiguous, or nonspecifi c chest X-ray fi ndings, especially in immunocompromised patients (Beigelman-Aubry et al. 2012 ) , in case of atypical clinical and/or radiological presentations, or when an empyema or abscess is suspected (Stigl and Marrie 2013 ) . CT is able to detect even subtle lesions, while demonstrating them earlier than chest X-ray, as well as associated abnormalities or underlying conditions. In addition, it may suggest alternative diagnoses, and can guide interventions to take specimens for microbiology, regardless of the applied technique, either bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or percutaneous, transbronchial, or transthoracic needle biopsy. CT is also the imaging modality of choice to monitor response to specifi c treatment. Although the major CT patterns of pneumonia may be individualized, there is no specifi c one caused by one particular microorganism. Moreover, multiple CT patterns frequently coexist in the same patient with pulmonary infection. In addition, the radiological appearance of the organism-specifi c infection can change depending on the degree of the patients' immunosuppression. The infective agents also vary with the type of immune defi ciency. As the suggested diagnoses will very much depend on the individual setting, the conclusions drawn from the CT exam must always be integrated into the epidemiological, clinical data and laboratory tests and should result from a multidisciplinary approach. A fi rst reminder of the most common types of pneumonias will be proposed before describing the technical approach and the main CT patterns encountered in routine practice.",

It can vary from a mild outpatient illness (Herold and Sailer 2004 ) to a more severe disease requiring hospital admission and, at times, intensive care (Niedemann 2015 ) . The development of CAP may be related to either a defect in host defense, an exposure to an especially virulent pathogen, an overwhelming inoculum of microorganisms, or a combination of those factors (Stigl and Marrie 2013 ) . Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, HIV infection, and other forms of immune suppression, chronic kidney disease, old age, malignancy, any neurologic illness that predisposes to aspiration including seizures, alcoholic abuse, smoking, and splenectomy, are predisposing host conditions (Niedemann 2015 ) . The diagnosis of CAP, usually based on the presence of cough, fever, sputum production, and/or pleuritic chest pain, is supported by infi ltrates detected on the chest radiography in most cases. CT is therefore rarely required. Typical causative organisms of bacterial CAP include gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) that is responsible for approximately one-third of all cases of CAP, Haemophilus infl uenzae , and atypical pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydophila pneumoniae (formally Chlamydia ), and Legionella (Niedemann 2015 ) . Viral agents, such as infl uenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus , may also be involved, as well as fungi and parasites. About 10-20 % of all adult patients hospitalized with CAP require admission to an intensive care unit. Severe CAP, usually defi ned by respiratory and/or circulatory failure, requires mechanical ventilation in 40-80 % of cases, with concomitant septic shock in up to 50 % of cases and a high mortality rate (Stigl and Marrie 2013 ) . Usual complications observed in severe CAP include empyema, lung abscess, pneumothorax, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, major cardiac events such as acute coronary syndrome, and multisystem organ failure (Stigl and Marrie 2013 HAP or nosocomial pneumonia occurs 48 h or more after admission and does not appear to be incubating at the time of admission. Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections and most commonly affects intensive care unit (ICU) patients, particularly individuals requiring mechanical ventilation (Franquet 2008 ) . VAP is a type of HAP that develops more than 48-72 h after endotracheal intubation. HCAP is defi ned as pneumonia that occurs in settings of a nonhospitalized patient with extensive healthcare contact, such as wound care, residency in a nursing home, or hemodialysis. The latter pneumonia is increasingly caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. (Jones 2010 ) . Nosocomial pneumonia due to viruses or fungi is signifi cantly less common, except in the immunocompromised patient.",

            "text": "Today, CT has to be performed on a multidetector row CT scanner acquiring around 1 mm-thick sections and using an exposure dose which needs to be carefully chosen. Low-dose (LD) CT may be used without impairing the diagnostic information of specifi c CT patterns, in particular in case of pulmonary fungal infections (Christe et al. 2012 ) , and even ultralow dose (ULD) CT may be possible, according to the clinical context. Overall, the dose may be decreased depending on the size of anomalies to be detected. If they are greater than 1 cm, which is often the case for patients with cystic fi brosis and suspected of acute pulmonary infections, ULD-CT at a dose that nearly reaches that of a chest X-ray may demonstrate the abnormalities, provided that the series are reconstructed with the correct technical parameters (Fig. 1 ) . These doses also apply to the follow-up of this young population that is exposed to frequent ionizing radiation procedures during the whole life. In other cases, LD-CTs with a CTDI of 2-3 mGy.cm in nonobese patients (Bankier and Tack 2010 ) are perfectly suited for the follow-up of infectious lung diseases (Fig. 2 ) . A comparison with previous baseline examinations is always required to accurately assess the disease's evolution. Of importance, although ULD-CT with a mean radiation expose dose of 0.60 \u00b1 0.15 mSv has been proven to provide acceptable image quality in case of pulmonary infections in febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy (Kim et al. 2014 ) , caution must be taken due to potential pitfalls with LD-CT (Fig. 3 ). Multiplanar reformats with average intensity projection (AIP) postprocessing of variable thickness may give rise to tomographic or chest X-ray appearance (Figs. 4 and 5 ) that may be compared with previous or following conventional chest X-rays. The use of maximum intensity projection (MIP) may optimize the detection of micronodules, which sometimes cannot be assessed by using thin slices alone (Fig. 6 ). It is also helpful to characterize micronodules as centrilobular ones with tree in bud appearance (Fig. 7 ) , corresponding to a bronchocentric distribution, or as ones with a random distribution as seen in miliary disease ( Fig. 8 ) (Beigelman-Aubry et al. 2005 ) . The use of minimum intensity projection (mIP) allows to accurately locate an abnormal area in order to guide a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (Fig. 9 ), to differentiate bronchiectasis from a cavitary lesion (Fig. 1 ) , to visualize the drainage bronchus in the latter situation, as well as to help to recognize a bronchopleural fi stula.",

            "text": "Ground-glass opacity, a common but nonspecifi c fi nding, which refers to a hazy increased opacity of lung with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins (Hansell et al. 2008 ) , is a major feature of interstitial pneumonia. Pathologically, it is characterized by a mononuclear infl ammatory cellular infi ltrate in the alveolar septa and the distal peribronchovascular interstitium (Muller 2003 ) . This interstitial infl ammatory reaction results from epithelial damage, with thickening of the peribronchial area and interlobular septa. Initially applied to different clinical and radiographic fi ndings from those caused by S. pneumoniae , atypical pneumonia refers to an interstitial pattern that can be associated with dense consolidation. The most common causes are viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia , and P. jirovecii . In viral infections and in those caused by M. pneumoniae , ground-glass attenuation is associated with signs of cellular bronchiolitis and focal consolidation fi tting with bronchopneumonia. When a predominant ground-glass opacity occurs in an immunocompetent patient, respiratory syncytial virus or varicella infection should be fi rst considered. In immunocompromised patients, P. jirovecii (Thomas and Limper 2004 ) . 1994 ) or Mycoplasma infection must be suggested. P. jiroveci infections typically present as ground-glass opacity sparing the pulmonary cortex that predominantly affects the upper region, especially in AIDS patients (Fig. 25 ) . A crazy-paving sign, defi ned as a combination of ground-glass opacity and smooth interlobular septal thickening that resembles a masonry pattern used in walkways (Hansell et al. 2008 ) , may be observed in infections, in particular with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and infl uenza (Walker et al. 2014 ) . Pulmonary cysts or pneumatoceles within the same areas should suggest PCP (Fig. 26 ) . In immunocompromised non-HIV-positive patients, features are less suggestive of the diagnosis, with rapid progression, this being the result of severe or dysregulated infl ammatory responses that are evoked by a relatively small number of Pneumocystis organisms (Chang et al. 2013 ; Tasaka and Tokuda 2012 ) (Fig. 27 ). In the latter category of patients, groundglass opacities can also be caused by viral (Fig. 28 ) or pyogenic infection (Kang et al. 1996 ) . Peculiar aspects of GGO are seen with the halo sign (see below) and the reversed halo sign Fig. 24 Diffuse alveolar consolidation with air bronchogram and ground-glass opacity in a patient with autoimmune hepatitis treated with long-term steroids presenting with dyspnea and severe hypoxemia. This was related to a Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Note the pneumomediastinum in this mechanically ventilated patient staying in the intensive care unit who died from this severe infection with rapid deterioration (RHS ), defi ned as focal rounded area of groundglass opacity surrounded by a crescent or complete ring of consolidation (Fig. 29 ) (Georgiadou et al. 2011 ) . Histopathologically, the RHS has been associated to infarcted lung tissue, with a greater amount of hemorrhage at the periphery than at the center, with a frequent subsequent cavitation after neutropenia recovery (Wahba et al. 2008 ) . Halo sign (HS) and RHS are highly suggestive of early infection by an angioinvasive fungus in severely immunocompromised patients. The former is most commonly associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the latter with pulmonary mucormycosis. An RHS may also be related to other infectious diseases, in particular invasive aspergillosis, tuberculosis, or paracoccidioidomycosis (Georgiadou et al. 2011 ) .",

Although inconstant, with a reported incidence of ranging from 25 to 95 % among neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies (Georgiadou et al. 2011 ) , the HS strongly suggests an early invasive aspergillosis in patients with severe neutropenia (Fig. 37 ) , in association with wedge-shaped areas of subpleural consolidation. Furthermore, initiation of antifungal treatment on the basis of the identifi cation of an HS by chest CT appears associated with a signifi cantly better response to treatment and improved survival (Greene et al. 2007 ). In invasive aspergillosis, these nodules typically become larger during neutrophil engraftment (Barnes and Marr 2007 ) and/or during the fi rst 10 days of therapy (Caillot et al. 2001 ) . Histopathologically, the HS represents a focus of pulmonary infarction surrounded by alveolar hemorrhage, secondary to invasion by Aspergillus of small and medium-sized pulmonary vessels causing thrombosis and subsequent ischemic necrosis of the lung parenchyma (Georgiadou et al. 2011 ) . The same appearances have been reported in numerous infectious pulmonary diseases such as observed with Mucorales , Candida , herpes simplex virus , cytomegalovirus , varicella-zoster virus , mycobacterial infections, bacterial pneumonia, or septic emboli (Fig. 38 ) . The differential diagnoses of noninfectious nodules with an HS include granuloma-tosis with polyangiitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, adenocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma in association with spiculated nodules, and hemorrhagic metastases (Georgiadou et al. 2011 ) .",

The primary source of infection is tricuspid endocarditis, especially in intravenous illicit drug use, peripheral thrombophlebitis, venous catheter, and pacemaker wires. The mechanism includes endothelial damage combined with the formation of crumbling thrombi containing infective agents. Turbulences caused by the circulating blood detach fragments of thrombus which then migrate to the peripheral Ischemia then results in infarction and/or hemorrhage and the organisms release toxins causing parenchymal necrosis (Muller 2003 ) . Nodules related to septic emboli are mainly peripheral and basal with blurred margins. A simultaneous appearance of solid nodules and nodules with variable size cavitations (Fig. 38 ) as well as subpleural wedge-shaped consolidation may be seen (Franquet 2008 ) . The nodules often appear to have a vessel leading into them on axial views -the so-called \"feeding vessel\" signcorresponding to the pulmonary vein, whereas most arteries have a lateralized trajectory around the nodule (Dodd et al. 2006 ) (Fig. 39 ) .",

Right paratracheal, hilar, and subcarinal regions and/or hilar lymph node enlargement with associated homolateral small focal infi ltrate or parenchymal consolidation, which is commonly sublobar and subpleural in location in the middle lobe, basal segments of lower lobes, and anterior segments of upper lobes, is the usual hallmark of primary TB (Beigelman et al. 2000 ) . Necrotic components with peripheral rim enhancement (rim sign) mainly suggest tuberculosis, but they can also correspond to fungal infection, atypical mycobacteria, histoplasmosis, metastases (Fig. 46 ) from head/neck and testicular malignancy, and lymphoma (Bhalla et al. 2015 ) . Bronchonodal fi stula can be observed as a complication of active pulmonary TB with TB lymphadenitis especially in the elderly. The fi stulas usually involve the right lobar bronchus and the main bronchus on the left side (Park et al. 2015 ) . \u2022 A circumferential thickening of the esophagus may be related to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, esophagitis being the second most common gastrointestinal manifestation of this organism after colitis (Wang et al. 2015 ) , or Candida (Kuyumcu 2015 ) infection in immunocompromised patients. \u2022 In case of a circumferential thickening of the trachea or main bronchi occurring in the same context, the possibility of invasive aspergillosis of the respiratory tract should always be considered (Fig. 47 ) with the specifi c risk of tracheal rupture. Acute tuberculous tracheobronchial involvement may also be seen with circumferential narrowing associated with smooth or irregular wall thickening (Bhalla et al. 2015 ) . Sequelar fi brotic bronchostenosis predominating on the left main bronchus and post-obstructive bronchiectasis may occur in this setting (Bhalla et al. 2015 ) . \u2022 Acute infectious mediastinitis may rarely be observed. It appears as increased soft tissue attenuation of mediastinal fat with fl uid collections, air bubbles, air-fl uid levels, and pneumomediastinum, with pericardial/pleural effusion. Regarding chronic or fi brosing mediastinitis, especially related to tuberculosis and fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis, CT may display focal or diffuse involvement with calcifi cations as well as stenosis/obstruction of the vessels, airways, or esophagus (Akman et al. 2004 ).",

Most of the parapneumonic effusions without pleural thickening resolve under adequate medical treatment. \u2022 Empyema , which occurs in less than 5 % of pulmonary infections, typically displays obtuse angles along its interface with adjacent pleura. It appears as a smooth and thin enhancement of the visceral and parietal pleura that surrounds the fl uid collection and that is referred as the split pleura sign (Walker et al. 2014 ) (Figs. 10 and 11 ). It is commonly associated with a hyperattenuation of the extra-pleural fat. The pathogens traditionally involved in empyema are S. pneumoniae , Streptococcus pyogenes , and S. aureus . The same fi ndings may be seen in case of TB. \u2022 In this setting, an air-fl uid level suggests a bronchopleural fi stula (Walker et al. 2014 ) , which is a sinus tract between a bronchus and the pleural space that most often results from a necrotizing pneumonia. CT features of bronchopleural fi stula include an intrapleural airspace of various sizes, a new or changed air-fl uid level, and, possibly, a fi stulous communication, which may be become visible after the use of mIP post-processing. The air-fl uid level within the pleura usually exhibits a length disparity when comparing posterior and lateral chest radiographs or between coronal and sagittal reformats unlike an air-fl uid level associated with a pulmonary abscess typically displaying a spherical shape (Walker et al. 2014 ).",
