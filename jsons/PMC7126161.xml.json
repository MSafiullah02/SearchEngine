The commenting couple observes the outcome of what, in their own culture, would seem to be a surprising marriage decision by another couple. They speculate, perhaps naively, that arranged marriage traditions, common in some cultures but not others, had a significant impact on how the other couple chose each other. This scenario illustrates just one of many questions that a specialist in culture and decision making, or even a layperson, is likely to encounter. One purpose of this review is to describe and interpret major themes in evolving scholarship on culture and decision making. Another is to argue for greater research attention to key unsettled or unaddressed questions.",

By \u201cculture\u201d we refer to the myriad ways of living exhibited by a particular group of people, ways that are transmitted from one generation to the next and which distinguish that group from others (cf. Smith, 1997). Researchers frequently use nationality as a proxy for culture, but other factors such as religion and social class can divide people into distinctly identifiable \u201ccultures\u201d as well (Cohen, 2009). People who rely on different modes of subsistence can give rise to distinct cultures, too (Talhelm et al., 2014, Uskul et al., 2008), as can people who carved out their migratory path on a frontier as opposed to settling in a pre-developed area (Kitayama, Conway, Pietromonaco, Park, & Plaut, 2010). While we embrace this broad definition of culture, much of existing work on culture and decision making has focused on North American and East Asian populations to the neglect of others.",

How good or bad would each outcome be for the decision maker (and/or other parties)? How should one manage tradeoffs between options? Finally, the decision maker deals with issues in the aftermath: What do other parties think of the decision? What can the decision maker do to assure that the decision is implemented?

The CIP directs attention to such gaps. Our readers may be interested in a broad variety of questions, most of which we expect are covered by one of the ten cardinal issues.

Therefore we highlighted topics that have received little attention or may be fruitful for further research. To facilitate interpretation of the findings, we have written a preface describing major constructs that have been used to explain cultural differences. Finally, we avoided repeating discussions of work that has already been expertly reviewed previously, particularly work on risk and judgment (e.g., by Choi et al., 2004, Savani et al., 2015, Weber and Hsee, 2000, Weber and Morris, 2010).",

One dimension of culture that has received substantial attention is individualism-collectivism (or, similarly, independence-interdependence, Hofstede, 1980, Markus and Kitayama, 1991, Oyserman et al., 2002, Triandis, 2004). These dimensions are associated with different conceptualizations of the \u201cself.\u201d Individualistic cultures bestow greater autonomy on the \u201cself\u201d; each person is understood to be a discrete entity, independent of others, with relatively immutable characteristics and with free agency. Individualistic cultures tend to value personal goal pursuit as opposed to accommodation to others\u2019 goals. Uniqueness and self-expression are also generally valued in such cultures. Collectivistic cultures, by contrast, view the \u201cself\u201d as part of a whole. Each person is expected to work with his or her in-group toward goals, to vary one\u2019s personal behavior according to social context, and to generally \u201cfit in\u201d and pursue group harmony. As reviewed below, these differences have been proposed to underlie much cross-cultural variation in decision-making, such as the decision modes people use, their preferences, negotiation styles, creativity, and more.",

While most cultural differences have been interpreted in light of the individualism/collectivism framework, many differences could be explained by differences in tightness/looseness instead. The two constructs are somewhat correlated, with collectivistic cultures being tighter than individualistic cultures. This may explain why, in decision-making, collectivists often weigh input from others more than individualists; they may be concerned with adhering to norms.",

Holistic thinking is a cognitive style frequently associated with East Asian cultures. It is characterized by attention to context, an emphasis on relationships between entities, belief that the world is in constant flux, and tolerance for apparent contradiction (Nisbett et al., 2001, Peng and Nisbett, 1999). Analytic thinking is frequently associated with Western cultures, and it is characterized by a focus on the main object, a category (vs. relationship-based) view of objects, belief that the world is stable and predictable, and adherence to rules of formal logic such as non-contradiction. Cognitive style has been theoretically linked to social orientation, such that individualists are relatively analytic, and collectivists are relatively holistic (Varnum, Grossmann, Kitayama, & Nisbett, 2010). Cognitive style has been used to explain various aspects of decision-making, such as what type of information people attend to and how people think about the future.",

            "text": "It is worth noting that while the above frameworks are often invoked as plausible explanations of cultural differences, many studies do not empirically test such links across a broad range of cultures. (We return to similar issues in \u201cFuture Directions.\u201d) It is also worth noting that while simple cross-cultural comparisons enlightened by these frameworks are abundant, culture has increasingly been understood as a non-fixed, dynamic, and context-dependent phenomenon (Briley, Wyer, & Li, 2014). Social context activates particular mindsets \u2013 say, an independent mindset \u2013 and this mindset in turn can influence one\u2019s judgments and decisions temporarily (Oyserman, Sorensen, Reber, & Chen, 2009). In another situation, an opposing mindset may be adopted such that the same person\u2019s judgments and decisions take on an altogether different pattern. This is not to say that culture has no stable component \u2013 societies reinforce relatively constant patterns of living and people internalize those ways of living to some degree. Moreover, psychological tendencies associated with different cultures may be due to powerful and relatively stable ecological forces such as climate, population density, disease burden, history of migration, and modes of subsistence (Gelfand et al., 2011, Kitayama et al., 2014, Talhelm et al., 2014, Uskul et al., 2008). Evidence from neuroscience also supports the constancy of cultural mindsets to some degree; repeated ways of thinking leave physical effects on the brain (Kitayama & Uskul, 2011). While it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore the antecedents of every cultural difference in decision making, we propose that cultural differences are both stable and context-dependent. We anticipate that exploration of the origins and nature of cultural differences will continue.",

Chinese participants were more likely than Canadians to purchase falling stocks; thus Chinese were more likely to see falling trends as opportunities.

Regarding the Russian/American difference in advice giving, Chentsova-Dutton and Vaughn (2012) argue that Russians value advice because they are accustomed to living in a society where official means of information exchange and social aid are unreliable. Thus, in their case, collaboration is not driven by a collectivistic desire to please others but rather by a desire to disseminate helpful information. In contrast to the Russian case, Savani et al. (2011) do not attribute advice giving and accommodation in India to the lack of a reliable informational infrastructure. Rather, they propose that high population density and limited social mobility lead to strong reputational concerns for individuals. These concerns, the authors contend, lead people to strive to be known as supportive and selfless in their advice giving so that they are trusted and embraced in their social networks.",

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese were found to be more decisive than ethnic Malays (Swami et al., 2008). A more recent study compared East Asians, South Asians, and European Canadians (Ng & Hynie, 2014).

These factors, in Ng and Hynie\u2019s data, mediated the link between culture and indecisiveness. Na\u00efve dialecticism involves embracing conflicting beliefs about the world, such as affirming both the positive and negative side of an issue. This cognitive approach may require more energy and reflection to reach a decision, given its complexity. High need for cognition, by definition, would also promote more cognitive investment in the decision-making process. Yates et al. (2010) proposed that relevant norms common in China and Japan might differ despite their shared collectivism; Japanese might be especially indecisive because they value indecisiveness, perhaps under a more flattering label such as \u201cthoroughness.\u201d The Japanese participants of Yates et al. (2010) reported being more indecisive than Chinese and Americans, and they were more likely than Chinese and Americans to admire indecisive people, too.

Other research has investigated the degrees to which novelty and usefulness are central to different cultures\u2019 definitions of creativity. In a comparison among China, Japan, and the U.S., the influence of perceived novelty on creativity ratings of products did not vary by country, and usefulness was more related to creativity for Americans and Japanese than for Chinese subjects (Paletz & Peng, 2008).

Researchers have suggested that individualistic cultures promote deviance, uniqueness, and divergent thinking, whereas collectivistic cultures promote conformity in thinking (Erez & Nouri, 2010). Goncalo and Staw (2006) found that, when instructed to be creative, subjects experimentally primed with individualism (vs. collectivism) generated more creative solutions to a problem. They also found that whether groups were asked to list the most creative or the most practical idea from their idea sets, ideas listed by individualistic groups were judged to be more creative than those of collectivist groups \u2013 regardless of whether they were instructed to be creative or practical (Study 3). The authors suggest that individualistic groups both generated and chose more creative ideas because of their inclination toward divergent thinking and, in a group context, their desire to be unique and to stand out in discussions for idea selection. Collectivistic groups, by contrast, were hesitant to share deviant ideas and to suggest unique options for selection. These study results support the idea that cultural differences in creativity may be due, at least in part, to how creative processes are shaped by social orientation.

Maddux and Galinsky (2009) found that the extent to which individuals adapt to\u2013 not merely live in \u2013 a foreign culture predicts creativity. Notably, some evidence suggests that cross-cultural exposure should be broad and deep in \u201cmoderation.\u201d Cross-cultural experience of fashion house directors has been found to be beneficial for the perceived creativity of the house\u2019s products (Godart, Maddux, Shipilov, & Galinsky, 2015), but only when the breadth and depth of the experience was not too extreme. The authors argued that too much depth of cross-cultural adaptation could lead people to lose sight of what is interesting and unique in the culture and they may become cognitively entrenched. Too much breadth in cross-cultural experience (e.g., living in too many places) could lead people to become cognitively overwhelmed by information and therefore unable to use it well. Second, exposure to other cultures enhances creativity when the exposure allows for mental juxtaposition of two or more cultures. Leung and Chiu (2010) found that measured (Study 2) and experimentally-induced (Study 1) multicultural experience predicted creativity, but only when cultures were presented in tandem, either juxtaposed (e.g., a slide set on Chinese culture and American culture) or blended (e.g., a slide set on East/West cultural fusion).",

This in turn should lead to generating creative ideas. Tadmor, Galinsky, and Maddux (2012) argue that mere access to more cultural information does not lead to creativity, however. They instead suggest that the manner in which the information is processed is key. Specifically, integrative complexity \u2013 being able to understand and combine multiple perspectives \u2013 yields high creativity. Tadmor et al.\u2019s findings support this mechanism. They found that only people who adopted an \u201cintegration\u201d acculturation strategy \u2013 identifying with both their host and heritage cultures \u2013 were more creative (Cheng, Sanchez-Burks, & Lee, 2008, found similar results). Those who identified with neither culture or with only one culture were less creative despite also having had multicultural experience. Integrative complexity mediated the effect of acculturation strategy on creativity, suggesting that integration acculturation boosted people\u2019s ability to simultaneously access and combine disparate information from different cultures.",

In this view, events that are observed to have occurred can easily be rationalized as having been inevitable because of the chain of connections revealed after the fact. This, in turn, could lead to overconfidence for groups that think holistically (vs. analytically).

When they do assign causality to an individual leader, it has been found to be based on the actions of the leader\u2019s group; thus individuals are held responsible according to their group\u2019s behavior (Zemba, Young, & Morris, 2006).",

These tendencies may lead East Asians to attribute causality to context and Westerners to attribute it more to internal dispositions. A Western exception may be Latin Americans.

There is evidence that Indians make choices that are less closely linked to their personal preferences than do U.S. students (Savani et al., 2008). As previously discussed, in Indian and several other collectivist cultures, people often use decision modes that involve and take other people into account. Therefore, the values and expectations of others \u2013 not just one\u2019s own \u2013 become an important consideration in decision-making. From this perspective, it makes sense that the decision maker\u2019s own values would have relatively less impact than in an individualistic culture, where fewer concerns must be considered. People in collectivist cultures can even find positive value in choosing options that adhere to norms rather than following personal preference. In one study, both Brazilians and Americans indicated that they were likely to follow norms when deciding on behavior. Further, the Brazilians were far more likely than the Americans to also indicate that they would be happy about following those norms (Bontempo, Lobel, & Triandis, 1990). Similarly, Indians have not reported feeling constricted or burdened when accommodating others in their decision making (Savani et al., 2011). Thus, although personal value matters enormously in Westerners\u2019 decision-making, they appear to be less important in other cultures due to their collectivism and tightness.",

Eastern European groups represented in their study had especially high loss aversion while African groups on average had the lowest loss aversion. The authors measured various cultural variables in search of explanations of country- and individual-level differences. Country-level individualism was positively correlated with loss aversion. This relationship was also found at the individual level while controlling for country-level effects, such that a person\u2019s deviation from her country\u2019s mean individualism level was correlated with her loss aversion levels. This finding is consistent with Weber and Hsee\u2019s (2000) \u201ccushion hypothesis.\u201d They proposed that collectivist cultures support risk taking because one\u2019s close social network members can offer financial support in the event of setbacks. Thus, there is less reason to fear losses; they often can be alleviated. Also of note is that other country-level factors such as religious composition were related to loss aversion, although potential explanations remain to be explored.",

In some studies, relative to their counterparts of another culture, Americans have been found to prefer direct communication (Adair, Brett, & Okumura, 2001) and take a more competitive approach (Pearson & Stephan, 1998). In contrast to Americans, Japanese negotiators have been seen as more likely to use indirect communication and influence (e.g., sympathy, reference to status) while Brazilians more strongly favor collaboration, accommodation, and avoidance, especially for negotiations with in-group members. Other work has examined cultural effects in a more nuanced way. Gelfand et al. (2013) studied negotiating groups vs. individuals in Japanese and American cultures. They expected that groups would show greater cultural differences because social monitoring, which occurs in groups but not individual settings, would amplify concerns for adhering to social norms. Thus, a group (vs. solo) negotiation would strengthen already-present norms of competitiveness for Americans, whereas group negotiation would strengthen already-present norms for harmony with their Taiwanese participants. The researchers also expected that groups would outperform individuals in U.S. contexts, because people in groups would be more competitive than individuals. In the East Asian context, groups would perform worse than individuals, because people in groups would be more concerned with harmony, which is detrimental to achieving optimal negotiation outcomes. The study found partial support for this idea; American teams did not outperform solo negotiators, but Taiwanese groups performed worse than solo negotiators. Taiwanese groups also performed more poorly than American groups. The latter effect was mediated by harmony differences; Taiwanese groups performed more poorly due to their concerns with maintaining harmony.",

It includes preparing for, adapting to, and learning from cross-cultural interactions as well as engaging in perspective-taking (Mor, Morris, & Joh, 2013). In one study, negotiating dyads that had higher overall CQ were shown to be more likely than lower CQ dyads to employ mutually-beneficial bargaining strategies (integrative information behavior), which led to more joint profit (Imai & Gelfand, 2010, Study 2). Importantly, the dyads were only as effective as their lowest-CQ members. Other factors such as international experience, emotional intelligence, and extraversion failed to predict integrative information behaviors (Imai & Gelfand, 2010). CQ has also been found to be positively related to cultural perspective taking which, in turn, boosts intercultural cooperation (Mor et al., 2013). A cultural perspective-taking intervention designed by Mor et al. successfully increased negotiators\u2019 cooperation, particularly for negotiators who were low in CQ.

While that body of work has been richly informative, we note three resulting limitations. One, obviously, is that the generalizability of those findings to other cultural groups might be limited. Someone who hopes to learn about Mexican decision making would be ill-advised to only read the literature largely about East Asians and conclude, \u201cSince Mexicans are fairly collectivistic, like East Asians, their decision making practices must be similar.\u201d Thus we propose that investigators focus their efforts on a more diverse set of national cultures as well as differences within regional boundaries. A second, related limitation is that individualism and collectivism are frequently used to explain cultural differences to the neglect of other factors. When considering only a single East Asian and Western cultural group, this construct may very well account for differences. However, other collectivistic cultures likely make decisions very differently than, say, Japanese people, so other factors will need to be developed and examined as explanations of those differences. A third limitation is that early cultural work in psychology seldom differentiated between individual and group-level effects. That differentiation is crucial to properly understanding the relationships between variables of cultural interest. Hypothetically, a researcher might find a positive relationship between individualism and preference for unique products across 30 cultures at the group level. However, if the investigator were to look at individuals within a given culture, the relationship might be virtually null, reversed, or variable between groups (Na et al., 2010). Some researchers have indeed demonstrated this type of effect (Leung & Cohen, 2011).",

Effectiveness is subjective; it depends on the extent to which the intended outcome is achieved for the decision\u2019s beneficiary. Nevertheless, decision making practices of one culture may have inherent benefits or pitfalls affecting any culture that uses them. For example, Toyota\u2019s American offices seem to have imported very thorough Japanese decision making strategies (Liker, 2004). Thoroughness might almost universally reduce people\u2019s likelihood of being blindsided by unexpected consequences, but it may also render decision making slow and cumbersome. Researchers may also explore what factors lead to successful (vs. disastrous) transfer of decision making practices. Must features of a particular strategy \u201cmatch\u201d the culture in order to be effective? Or might a clash between a foreign decision strategy and local habits push people to decide better?",
