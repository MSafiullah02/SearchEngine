            "text": "Eosinophils, granule-bearing leukocytes found in peripheral blood and tissues, are best known for their roles in asthma, allergy, and other disorders in which eosinophils are recruited in response to cytokines released by type-2 helper (Th2) T lymphocytes. Eosinophils do not ordinarily come to mind when one thinks generally of respiratory virus infection. However, at least for one important respiratory virus, the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), eosinophils and their unique secretory mediators have been detected in lung tissue in response to primary infection and as a feature of a characteristic hypersensitivity response to inactivated vaccines and vaccine components. Interestingly, eosinophil recruitment and accumulation are almost always perceived in a negative light, as it is assumed that these cells contribute to tissue damage, bronchoconstriction and respiratory dysfunction via degranulation of their cationic secretory proteins and enzymes. However, recent descriptions of antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo suggest that eosinophil function may encompass both of these functions, and present more of a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d Clearly, we do not have a complete understanding of the role of eosinophils in disease caused by RSV; this review highlights many of the questions that remain to be answered.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a near universal affliction of infancy and childhood, accounting for approximately 50% of all pneumonia and up to 90% of the reported cases of bronchiolitis in infancy. Of those infants infected during the first year of life, one-third develop lower respiratory tract disease, and 2.5% are hospitalized, accounting for more than 90,000 children in the United States every year. In many previously healthy infants, RSV disease is a mild and self-limited infection involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, with varying degrees of peribronchiolar and interstitial inflammation. In others, disease progresses to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, including submucosal edema and bronchiolar obstruction requiring oxygen, and in the worst cases, mechanical ventilation. Infants at particularly high risk for severe disease include those born prematurely, infants and children with cardiac or pulmonary anomalies, and the immunocompromised, although a recent study by Hall et al. (2009) noted that a substantial portion of the children with serious illness had no pre-existing medical condition. Prophylactic monoclonal antibody therapy is available for high risk infants only, but no vaccine has been approved for use. RSV has also recently been recognized as an important pathogen in the institutionalized elderly. The clinical features and pathology of RSV disease have been reviewed extensively, and the reader is referred to these excellent sources of additional information (Melero, 2007, Breary and Smyth, 2007, Stevens et al., 2008, Miyairi and DeVincenzo, 2008, Collins and Crowe, 2007).",

            "text": "Eosinophils are leukocytes of the granulocyte lineage, as are neutrophils and basophils. Eosinophils differentiate in the bone marrow from CD34 antigen-positive pluripotent progenitor cells and are released into the bloodstream in more or less completely mature state. Under normal, homeostatic conditions, very few eosinophils can be detected in peripheral blood (only \u223c2\u20133% of total leukocytes), as the vast majority reside in the tissues, primarily the gastrointestinal tract. In response to as yet incompletely characterized stimuli, typically observed in allergic states, during infection with helminthic parasites, and in some idiopathic hypereosinophilic states, Th2 lymphocytes are activated, which results in the production of a specific subset of \u201cTh2\u201d cytokines, including interleukin-5 (IL-5). Interleukin-5 has a unique impact on the eosinophil lineage, as it induces the expansion of eosinophil progenitors in the bone marrow, it primes of eosinophils in the periphery, and it prolongs eosinophil survival in the tissues. Eosinophils are capable of responding to a wide variety of other stimuli, and can undergo chemotaxis in response to eotaxin-1 (CCL11), MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), and RANTES (CCL5), which are chemoattractant cytokines that interact with eosinophils via specific cell surface receptors (CCR3, and CCR1/CCR5, respectively). Interestingly, despite years of research, there is still no absolute consensus on eosinophil physiology and function, even in well-characterized disease states. For example, while eosinophils and eosinophil secretory mediators can promote destruction of helminth eggs and larvae in experiments performed in vitro, experiments performed in vivo with cytokine-deficient and eosinophil-deficient mice have yielded complex and inconsistent results (reviewed in Klion and Nutman, 2004, Fabre et al., 2009). Similarly, although the weight of evidence suggests that eosinophils contribute to the pathophysiology of allergy and asthma, a chronic respiratory disease in which bronchoconstriction in response to environmental triggers is typically associated with production of Th2 cytokines and recruitment of eosinophils to the airways (reviewed in Lee et al., 2001, Foster et al., 2008, Nissim Ben Efraim and Levi-Schaffer, 2008), asthmatic responses are obviously negative sequelae of eosinophil function that alone cannot represent a direct evolutionary advantage to the host organism. Among the more recent hypotheses, several groups have focused on eosinophils as immunomodulatory mediators, as eosinophils can interact both directly and indirectly with T cells and mast cells, and can release a wide variety of preformed cytokines and other secretory mediators, primarily from cytoplasmic granules (Jacobsen et al., 2007a, Akuthota et al., 2008, Lacy and Moqbel, 2001). There are several recent and complete reviews of eosinophil biology that provide extensive coverage of these and related subjects (Rothenberg and Hogan, 2006, Hogan et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Mature eosinophils from all species are readily recognized by their eccentric bilobed nuclei and their characteristic red-staining cytoplasmic granules; examples of human and mouse eosinophils are shown in Fig. 1\n. As noted, human eosinophil granules are storage sites for cationic secretory mediators, including a unique eosinophil peroxidase, the eosinophil major basic protein, ribonucleases eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), and numerous enzymes and cytokines. Despite similar morphology, human and mouse eosinophils differ from one another, and cannot be presumed to function identically in all circumstances. For instance, while there are several reports describing high affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u025bRI) in human eosinophils from parasite-infected and asthmatic subjects (Gounni et al., 1994, Barata et al., 1997, Rajakulasingam et al., 1998), this finding and its functional significance has been questioned (Kita et al., 1999), and Fc\u025bRI has never been detected on eosinophils isolated from mice. Similarly, the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin Siglec 8, can be detected on the surface of human eosinophils, while mouse eosinophils express the highly divergent functional ortholog, Siglec F. The mouse eosinophil ribonucleases are highly divergent orthologs of human EDN and ECP (Larson et al., 1996) and Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, a major human eosinophil component, cannot even be identified in the mouse genome. Mouse eosinophils also display a profoundly reduced propensity to degranulate and undergo differential chemotaxis to known exogenous stimuli (Clark et al., 2004, Borchers et al., 2002, Lee and Lee, 2005). As such, eosinophils from humans and mice may look similar to one another, but they may not be formally identical to one another in their actions and in their capacity to cause, to ameliorate, or even to serve as biomarkers for disease.",

In other words, we still do not know whether the vaccinated children became ill because of pulmonary eosinophilia, whether the eosinophils were engaged in altering future responses to virus infection, or whether eosinophilia is a neutral secondary finding. These questions have been explored to some extent in mouse models using wild type and gene-deleted mice immunized with vaccinia-virus vectors expressing RSV-G and RSV-F proteins (Castilow et al., 2008a, Castilow et al., 2008b, Johnson et al., 2008, Castilow and Varga, 2008), but, as noted above, these experimental systems are now recognized as mechanistically unrelated to the pathology induced by formalin-inactivated RSV antigens. As such, although findings address the role of eosinophils, and suggest that eosinophils may not be contributing to systemic disease (Castilow et al., 2007, Johnson et al., 2004, Johnson and Graham, 2004), these conclusions may not be directly relevant to the way in which eosinophils contribute to pathology in the setting of formalin-inactivated RSV antigens. The role of eosinophils in modulating pathology induced by formalin-inactivated vaccine antigens has not been explored, and might be addressed in mouse models of explicit eosinophil deficiency, i.e.\u2026the \u0394dblGATA (Yu et al., 2002) or TgPHIL mice (Lee et al., 2004).",

The data from mouse models are inconclusive on this point. Furthermore, the presence of eosinophils alone, even in human conditions, does not necessarily imply severe respiratory pathology. For example, in eosinophilic bronchiolitis, patients complain of only minimal respiratory symptomatology despite pronounced pulmonary eosinophilia (Scott and Wardlaw, 2006). Thus, at current writing, while eosinophils may serve as important biomarkers for aberrant hypersensitivity reactions, we can reach no conclusions regarding their contributions to pathophysiology from the published experimental data.",

Eosinophilia was also noted in a mouse model of secondary RSV challenge; Culley et al. (2002) detected eosinophil recruitment to the airways upon secondary RSV challenge among mice undergoing primary challenge at one day of age; eosinophil recruitment declined dramatically if primary challenge was delayed until mice were 1 week old, although the authors found no statistically significant difference in systemic disease, measured as weight loss, between these two sets of challenged mice. Dakhama et al., 2005a, Dakhama et al., 2005b likewise found that the extent of airway hyperresponsiveness induced by a secondary challenge was directly dependent on the age of first virus challenge, similarly associated with augmented eosinophil recruitment when the primary challenge occurred in mice <1 week of age. Tasker et al. (2008) performed a similar study, and identified Th2 cytokine responses in neonatally primed mice that were associated with diminished virus replication in lung tissue. Finally, also noteworthy is the study of Harker et al. (2007) in which mice were primed with recombinant RSVs expressing Th1 (IFN-gamma) or Th2 (IL-4) cytokines prior to RSV challenge. In contrast to mice primed with rRSV/IFN-gamma, mice primed with rRSV/IL-4 sustained airway eosinophilia in response to subsequent RSV challenge. Although IL-4 clearly functions to suppress antiviral CD8+ T cell function in many other experimental settings (Wasik et al., 1997, Villacres and Bergmann, 1999, Bot et al., 2000), challenge with RSV/IL-4 had no impact on the number of CD8+ T cells recruited to the lung nor on the fraction producing IFN-gamma when compared to mice challenged with wild-type RSV alone. The RSV/IL-4 primed mice had reduced lung virus titer and were protected against weight loss, a finding that correlated with the recruitment of eosinophils. As is clear from these findings, the precise role of eosinophils remains uncertain, but one thing that is clear is the fact that eosinophils do not universally provoke lung pathology and systemic disease.",

            "text": "One of the more curious aspects of eosinophil biology is, as discussed thus far in this review, once they are detected, particularly in lung tissue, eosinophils are almost always considered as contributing in some negative way to the pathophysiology of disease. This is most intriguing, given our understanding of the role of their sister cell, the neutrophil, and the concept of the double-edged sword (Smith, 1994). In other words, we know that neutrophils are recruited in response to bacterial and fungal infection, and serve to promote host defense against these invasive pathogens. However, if signals go awry, if neutrophil clearance does not proceed, and/or if neutrophil activation persists, pathology ensues. We were among the first groups to suggest that eosinophil function might encompass a positive, host-defense aspect as part of perhaps a more subtle double-edged sword (Rosenberg and Domachowske, 1999, Rosenberg and Domachowske, 2001), and to consider the possibility that eosinophils may be recruited in part to promote primary antiviral host defense, perhaps in situations in which acquired immune responses are less than immediately effective (Milner et al., 2007). Interestingly, eosinophilia has been reported in association with T cell dysfunction in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Tietz et al., 1997, Cohen and Steigbigel, 1996, Drabick et al., 1994); this finding may in turn be related to the propensity for hypersensitivity reactions observed among HIV-infected patients (Phillips and Mallal, 2007). However, correlations between eosinophilia and disease pathogenesis are often difficult to ascertain. In a primary study, Tietz et al. (1997) found that elevated eosinophil counts among HIV-infected patients correlated with progression of disease and declining CD4+ T cell counts, while Chorba et al. (2002) found no correlation between HIV viral loads, CD4+ T cell and eosinophil counts among more than 600 HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa, although concurrent helminthic parasite infection was clearly a confounding variable.",

In this work, we determined that eosinophils, acting at least in part via their secretory mediators, could reduce the infectivity of respiratory syncytial virus for target epithelial cells in vitro (Domachowske et al., 1998); Soukup and Becker (2003) likewise demonstrated that eosinophils inhibit RSV infection in tissue culture. Shortly thereafter, Adamko et al. (1999) demonstrated that eosinophils elicited by allergen sensitization served to limit virus replication and/or promote virus clearance in guinea pigs challenged with Sendai virus. In a more recent study, Phipps et al. (2007) demonstrated accelerated clearance of RSV from the lungs of the eosinophil-enriched IL-5 transgenic mice, and furthermore found that full antiviral activity was dependent on intact TLR signaling in eosinophils introduced exogenously (Fig. 4\n).",

            "text": "Our studies with PVM (Bonville et al., 2006) and examination of pathology specimens from RSV patients (Welliver et al., 2007, Johnson et al., 2007) demonstrate that pneumovirus replication in vivo takes place primarily in respiratory epithelial cells. However, it is clear that other cells, including human monocytes, support replication of RSV and PVM in culture, and release proinflammatory cytokines in response to virus infection (Barr et al., 2000, Dyer et al., 2007, Krilov et al., 2000). Given the questions regarding the role of eosinophils and their interactions with respiratory viruses, we set out to determine whether pneumoviruses could infect and replicate within eosinophils, and to determine what the outcome of this infection might be. Kimpen et al., 1996, Kimpen et al., 1992 originally demonstrated that RSV could be taken up by purified human eosinophils, and virions were identified in phagolysosomal compartments, but virus replication was not examined. To explore PVM replication in mouse eosinophils, we utilized our recently described method for generating sustained cultures of >95% pure mature eosinophils from unselected bone marrow progenitors (Dyer et al., 2008). With eosinophils generated by this culture method, we demonstrated greater than a fourfold increase in PVM titer, associated with the replication-dependent release of the cytokine interleukin-6 (Fig. 5\n). Others have explored interactions of pneumoviruses with eosinophils, including Davoine et al. (2008) who determined that human eosinophils were unable to release granule proteins in response to RSV challenge without coincident exposure of virus to CD4+ T cells and antigen presenting cells. This differential response might be explained by the work of Melo et al. (2008), who documented that granule proteins and cytokines are released from eosinophils via unique and distinct secretory pathways. Among the questions left to be explored: How often are infected eosinophils detected in vivo, at what point during an acute infection are they detected and under what specific circumstances? Does virus infection and intracellular replication induce eosinophil apoptosis or disable eosinophils in some other, more subtle way, and thereby reduce their ability to promote virus clearance and antiviral host defense? Answers to these questions may shed some light on differential responses observed in the aforementioned experiments.",

While pulmonary eosinophilia is a hallmark, or biomarker of the aberrant hypersensitivity response to formalin-inactivated RSV, there is no clear indication that eosinophils actually contribute to the negative sequelae of disease. Likewise, while severe primary RSV is associated with pulmonary eosinophilia and progression to asthma, these two features have not been linked clearly to one another mechanistically or pathophysiologically. Finally, several groups have shown that eosinophils can promote virus clearance, but this interesting and positive feature of eosinophil function is not observed in all circumstances or in all situations. Among the possibilities that have yet to be explored, eosinophil function may be less dependent on numbers elicited, and related more closely to the quality and extent of activation, to the unique nature of the cytokines eliciting recruitment, and/or to the strength of the signals sustaining viability in situ. These are all issues that are worthy of consideration, as we attempt to improve our understanding of the true nature of the eosinophilic leukocyte, and strive to achieve some clarification and sense of balance between their perceived negative and their incompletely characterized positive contributions to homeostasis and host defense.",
