I\u2019ve been an advocate for a Universal Basic Income\u2014an agreed upon amount of income distributed to all with no means test of any kind\u2014for about 13 of those years. It did not take long for me to go from well-intentioned but inexperienced social worker to brash disbeliever in the colonial model of charity and social service that is the flawed foundation of the U.S. welfare state. Prior to going to social work school, I already had ideas about \u201c welfare\u201d from conversations at home. My mother and my aunt, both of whom spent time on it\u2014my mother in the late 1960s and my aunt in the 1980s\u2014would talk about it. I overheard many conversations as a child between my mom and her friends, around the kitchen table in our \u201cproject\u201d apartment in Queens, New York. The moms said that the monthly check was not enough and that welfare \u201cworkers\u201d were uppity and obsessed with catching moms at home entertaining a man. As a kid, I overheard the moms use bad words when they talked about these welfare workers. We were instructed not to talk to the workers when they came to visit unannounced, their prying eyes scanning the rooms for men or for the new things they might buy the kids. When my mother remarried, the \u201cworkers\u201d stopped visiting, and they were not spoken of again.\n",

During social work school, I did what I thought helped poor people: volunteered in a shelter, at a food pantry. I donated a toy or a coat. Once I graduated, I worked: in a community counseling center; a special needs pre-school; a hospital; three psychiatric wards; a shelter for homeless families; a rural child protection department; and a public school system. At the beginning of my career, I thought that the income, housing, and other programs that existed would help people. I grew tired after many disappointments, including inexplicable \u201ccutoffs\u201d from cash welfare, Food Stamp and other applications getting \u201clost\u201d\u2014the solution to which is to apply all over again\u2014plus absent shelter directors, locked petty cash boxes whenever I needed to get someone some subway fare, and supervisors who got excited about holiday food \u201cdrives,\u201d toy \u201cdrives,\u201d and clothing \u201cdrives,\u201d but who balked at suggestions we demand increases in cash assistance or Food Stamps. We social workers knew well that means tests, compulsory job training programs and low monthly benefit amounts were not working. Means tests, for one, put obstacles between people and the means of survival. Why didn\u2019t we do something? Where, I wondered, were the activist social workers, the Bertha Capen Reynoldses, the Francis Perkinses, the Harry Hopkinses of the world? They sure weren\u2019t working where I worked. There were some notable efforts like the Social Welfare Action Alliance, started in 1985, for the most part social welfare organizations were not and are not activist.",

But then, while working on an education equity project at Fordham University, one day my boss, the late John Beam, saw me looking at Tyranny of\nKindness (Funiciello 1993) on his bookshelf. \u201cYou should really read that,\u201d he said. I took it home. I read it in two days and called the author, Theresa Funiciello. I asked her what I could do to not become part of the problem, which she argues is in great measure the social welfare establishment. We met and soon after, she introduced me to Karl Widerquist and Michael Lewis, the founders of the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network (USBIG), and I read their book, Economics for Social Workers (Lewis and Widerquist 2002). She took me to my first USBIG Congress soon after and to my first Basic Income European Network conference. It was life altering\u2014full of people thinking about why income was a right, thinking about income, and what happens when people don\u2019t have it. Some were practical and some were more abstract. There were people who wanted people to be free more than anything, and people who wanted to not be poor more than anything. I got to meet Jay Hammond, the Alaska governor who created the Alaska Permanent Fund, a universal payment to all residents of Alaska. I plunged into learning as much as I could about UBI while doing social work jobs.",

I began to write about social work from the point of view of belief in income transfers first, social services maybe. I continued to write once I\u2019d had to return to social work. Some of my articles, such as an opinion piece that was critical of \u201chealthy food financing initiatives\u201d and funding nutrition education for poor families, annoyed some people, like my supervisor at the time in an NYC public hospital (Pagen 2010), who felt that Democrats should not criticize other Democrats in public forums, even when the policy solutions offered up contained no cash for poor people (I was an Independent; but his assumption was that all social workers are Democrats).\n",

We discussed whether withholding income is a violation of one\u2019s right to live. Many of my students came to agree that in a modern society where people no longer have land and time to grow food and make their own supplies, that withholding income is a violation of everyone\u2019s right to live.",

This led me to believe that there was something profoundly wrong with the U.S. welfare system. In Tyranny of Kindness, Theresa had argued that welfare bureaucrats were perpetuating poverty through the design of our national \u201c welfare\u201d program, at the time called Aid to Families with Dependent Children. She also contended that big charities, the shelter system, and the food pantries and soup kitchens used money that would be better spent on income maintenance, and forced poor people to piece together survival from stuff with a lot of conditions attached and barely any cash. Cash, she wrote, was the one thing mothers on welfare needed. Chapter nine of Theresa\u2019s book was about Universal Basic Income. Her book predates the current rebirth of UBI by about 25 years.",

UBI made waves in the 1960s, and in the 1970s, a national UBI proposal passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice. In 1964, a panel of U.S. business leaders recommended a UBI in a document, the Triple Revolution; in 1968, a President\u2019s Commission on Income Maintenance Programs was examining universal income transfers as a new policy. As far back as the 1910s, women fought for cash transfers to mothers at the state level and were victorious in establishing Mothers\u2019 Pensions in some states, temporarily winning the argument that childrearing is work and requires cash not charity. Though a good deal of attention was paid to national hero and human rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the social work curriculum, his support for UBI, or Guaranteed Minimum Income (King 1967), went unmentioned. Richard Nixon\u2019s Family Assistance Plan gets a few sentences in social work textbooks, but if you blinked you\u2019d miss them. Part of how I came to UBI was seeing that despite its compelling simplicity and history, it was being ignored in the social work world. It largely still is, and that is something we social workers need to change. In 1964, the National Association of Social Workers officially endorsed a Guaranteed Annual Income. It is time for social work entities to endorse it again.",

TANF monthly payments are pegged in most states at three to four times less cash aid than the suggested cash aid in current UBI proposals. $1000 per month seems like a sensible starting point as long as there is a commitment to peg the benefit to the cost of living and assure that its purchasing power will therefore be maintained. Other proposals suggest $2000 per adult and an amount per child. For the reason of more cash alone, a UBI is vastly more adequate for meeting basic human needs than TANF.

Yet our social welfare programs are designed with payments set too low to meet basic human needs, and have been for decades. The redesign of AFDC to become TANF only worsened the inadequacy of the monthly cash assistance and began a systematic reduction of numbers of poor people enrolled. Now, TANF is also inadequate in that states enroll far fewer people than are eligible. Without income support, poor Americans are forced to consume costly services, such as medical care, early educational interventions, food from the discard market (leftovers and non-sellable food), and get only piecemeal help from charities when these organizations do used coat giveaways in winter and free turkeys at Thanksgiving. My career is full of memories of toy, food, and coat giveaways gone awry\u2014children in tears when \u201cSanta\u201d ran out of presents; when people who lined up for used coats could not find their size; a form clients had to sign at Catholic Charities saying they agreed they would only use the pantry once a month, when they needed to come every week because Food Stamp payments are so low.

            "text": "There were more events over time that solidified my belief in consistent, adequate, and universal income transfers. For one, I questioned the objection that distribution of income is socialism. That\u2019s a go-to accusation that people against UBI fling out, but it\u2019s baseless. Income distribution is not socialism, its what permits us to preserve our ability to be social while functioning in a market economy. I questioned that I was only worth something if producing something someone else wanted to pay me for. I also saw the reasonableness of UBI instead of means tested programs, because means tests seemed to create hazards: missed meals, missed rent, illness and missed opportunities. Food Stamps were cut by mistake, often, arbitrarily, for dozens of my clients every year. Terrible news events, like the two toddlers, Scylee and Ibanez Ambrose, who were scalded to death by a faulty radiator in an NYC shelter before Christmas of 2016, because the shelter operator didn\u2019t do needed repairs. The thousands of people of upstate New York, who in 2011 lost jobs, clothes, food, cars, and homes, when the region flooded after Hurricane Irene, who were then sent to line up for donated food and clothes in the blazing heat of August. There was the mother and father I met who needed to drive 70 miles to pick up his paycheck and had to suffer through an hour of questions to get gas money from our social services unit. To get the help approved, I had to calculate the dollar amount so close that for the whole trip, the parents worried that they would run out of gas. The story of Kimberly Dobbie of Maine, where only 19 out of every 100 families get TANF cash at all (CBPP 2018), who in 2017 was homeless and with two children, is another that highlights the dangers of having an unstable income. Short of money, she accepted free meals from a man who later murdered her.\n",

This is how Universal Basic Income works. There are many ideas about how our UBI should be designed, whether it should stack on top of existing programs, and what human needs should have separate guarantees, like a housing guarantee, which I support. We should welcome all these questions and come enthusiastically to the table with our different concerns and proposals. We cannot let differences of vision on how we should design our national UBI stop us from creating one. That is what the preservers of our status quo want, to deter us from establishing an income floor as a matter of right. But there is too much at stake to get sidelined over small differences.",

Having no income meant that the only way they could ever qualify for a low rent apartment was to survive the shelters first.

I passed out flyers and spoke at schools, at churches, and at community centers about the need to convert the Child Tax Credit to a fully refundable federal caregiver credit. Some established social services people reacted negatively when I presented our proposal. Perhaps they feared that social services agencies that provided respite services would lose some funding if the caregivers got money in their own pockets. I still recall how Carol Levine of the United Hospital Fund refused to sign our petition asking for Congress to create a fully refundable federal Caregiver Tax Credit when I approached her after her talk at Fordham University about ten years ago. \u201cThat\u2019s a waste of my fucking time,\u201d she said as she blew past me. \u201cWhen they treat you badly, it means you are doing something right,\u201d Theresa once said.",

Karl Widerquist and Michael A. Lewis, the founders of USBIG, helped find others in our community who could be part of Basic Income Action. I signed up. The launch of Basic Income Action was intended to provide long-term technical assistance for the locals who had the time and the will to do events.

I said, (a) we needed to hold our Movie Nights in places where far more people still didn\u2019t know or had not heard about UBI and (b) we needed to give those who already were committed to a UBI something far more enticing and useful to do than meet people new to it. We decided to have the next Basic Income Movie Night in West Harlem, hosted by a large tenants\u2019 association that was already actively fighting the sale of their buildings to a developer. Our Harlem Basic Income Movie Night was a hit. People who had never heard of UBI asked questions, argued with us and argued with each other; just what people need to be doing to be able to decide whether an idea works for them.",

Once we got started, great people jumped on board and there was no turning back. We spent June to October planning the Basic Income March. We quickly and fortunately picked up great people to be part of the team. I wrote a grant request so we could hire people to be our digital team. The Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity provided some support. Stacey Rutland and Dylan Enright came aboard, doing way more work than just our digital campaign. Hawk Newsome, Chairperson of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York and human rights activist, agreed to be emcee for the march. We got organizations to sponsor us. We got permits.",

Conrad Shaw and Deia Schlosberg, who are working on a film about their UBI project, Bootstraps, came from down the street in West Harlem. We had extended a call to UBI supporters in other cities to have marches and provided access to logos, signs, and images that they could adapt. We walked the route and realized that our planned route, from the South Bronx Post Office to West Harlem, was not going to work. The logistics were wrong, and there was a bus stop right there for a half dozen buses that would assure chaos. We found an alternate starting point and went with it, reversing the route to end in the Bronx and start in Manhattan. We would walk across West 145th and end in Mott Haven, one of the poorest districts in the United States. We visited the NYPD precincts and got permits.",

This idea of removing every aid program if a UBI passes has no legs and is a rumor pronounced by faceless people to frighten poor people. I know not one activist nor even one \u201ctech guy\u201d who embraces that idea; but these rumors are hard to shake. That said, I know that people will likely abandon TANF and its invasive behavior requirements and inadequate benefit amounts once they receive UBI, and that would be just fine. It is my hope that as people study UBI and talk to those who need it most, they will feel more confident in becoming activists for UBI. 48% of Americans support a Universal Basic Income for the United States (Gallup, 2019), and 75% of Canadians do, and both trends are upward.",

It is hard to get my head around declarations that somehow UBI\u2014money without a means test\u2014is a policy that harms poor people. There needs to be more work to get those most in need of income involved in UBI activism, so they can decide for themselves and take part in designing the UBI we need. If we double down on a world where only paid work is work, we are realigning our values to assign less importance to the things no one will pay us to do. Fewer people will be able to produce meaningful things, or help others. Lots more people will be poor, and lots more of us will have bullshit or make work jobs. Not a good scenario.\n",

In the weeks after Hurricane Irene hit New York in August 2011, a gigantic pile of donated clothes grew in the hallways of the various drop-off points, unable to be contained any longer. Local officials took note of the problem and coordinated vehicles to pick up all those clothes and bring them to one place big enough to hold it all: the stadium in the town of Sidney, New York. There they stored the numerous growing piles of socks, shirts, kids\u2019 jeans, jackets, sweatshirts, even neckties (who needs a necktie in August in the Northeast). By radio and by signs posted all around the counties, the word was put out that anyone needing clothing should go to Sidney stadium. But the demand for clothing wasn\u2019t nearly as big as the pile. Finally, after many months of costly storage and expended effort, the gigantic pile of donated clothing that grew out of the 2011 floods was hauled out of Sidney stadium in trucks and disposed of in an upstate landfill. Had the residents been given income instead, the whole sad, embarrassing affair would have been avoided.",

Kimberly Dobbie, the mother in Maine stabbed to death because when her state did not provide cash assistance, she had to accept help from a stranger, could have met her children\u2019s needs with her own money if her country had a Universal Basic Income. The 140 million poor and low-income Americans (Institute for Policy Studies 2018) who are expected to live without money, also need a Universal Basic Income. Currently, the U.S. has no cohesive and adequate social welfare policy, because it refuses to distribute income.

The catastrophic blow to the existing system of income through waged work brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the UBI movement even more. By intensifying our activism, presenting new members of the UBI community to run for office, and cooperating across communities to design an effective and just UBI, we can avoid more suffering. Our national anti-poverty program is no more than a slush fund to benefit states, not people; it is social engineering, perpetrated mostly on mothers of young children, masquerading as income support. It exacts labor from people in need. Instead of helping, it fuels social problems including depression, addiction, malnourishment and homelessness, and it is a public health and humanitarian crisis.
