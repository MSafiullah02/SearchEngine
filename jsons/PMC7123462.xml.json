Early symptoms may be minimal and limited to malaise and nasal symptoms. The nasal discharge is initially clear and watery. There is a subsequent transition period where the nasal discharge becomes viscous, opaque, and discolored (white, yellow, green) [2]. The color of the secretions is not predictive of a bacterial infection. The clinical presentation is similar in both adults and children. The episode tends to be self-limited. The median duration of a cold is 1 week, with most patients improving by the 10th day; however, lingering symptoms may last up to 2 weeks.",

Although the interpretation of guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, particularly for fever and moderate illness, rests with the clinician [10, 11], a large proportion of children are not immunized on schedule due to visits for URIs [12]. This finding also suggests additional visits for immunizations thereby requiring additional direct costs and indirect costs inherent in taking children to the physician\u2019s office.",

URIs have a seasonal variation with an increased prevalence in the United States between September and March. It is unclear why this variation exists, although it may be related to increased crowding of indoor populations in the colder months. Temperature is not the key to seasonal variation without the presence of a pathogen. Evidence from Antarctica showed that spacious well-ventilated rooms reduced transmission of URIs as compared to crowded poorly ventilated rooms regardless of temperature [15].",

In eight trials of antimicrobial treatment of URIs, six found no difference between the groups either in terms of improvement or in terms of complications. Complications tend to be minimal and occur at a rate of 10\u201315%. One trial found some slight benefit in decreasing the presence of purulent rhinitis [23]. Another found a decrease in rhinorrhea at day 5 but no difference between the groups at day 10 [24]. Similarly, an additional trial attempted to isolate \u201cbacterial colds\u201d for which antibiotics might be effective treatments [25]. Although there was some indication of patient improvement at day 5, the differences were gone by day 10. It is important to remember that the normal presentation of a URI is a week to 10 days.",

The trial showing an effect used more stringent enrollment criteria than the other two; the criteria in the trial are more consistent with those used in daily practice by primary care physicians. These data suggest that patients with more severe signs and symptoms may benefit from an antibiotic. If an antibiotic is to be used, some evidence with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole suggests that short-duration treatment (e.g., 3 days) is as effective as longer treatment [41].

            "text": "Differentiating group A streptococcal pharyngitis from viral disease is the most vexing problem in the management of acute sore throat. The clinical impression of the treating physician has been shown to be fairly inaccurate at making this differentiation [69\u201371]. A clinical prediction rule for presence of strep throat that has some utility uses the presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate. No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat [72]. Another dilemma in identifying group A strep in patients with pharyngitis is the sensitivity of rapid group A antibody kits compared to a throat culture. Many studies have shown that a rapid test is less sensitive than the culture for identifying the presence of group A strep. The rapid tests have a high degree of specificity, but their sensitivity in clinical practice can be unacceptably low. Sensitivities for the rapid test compared to a standard blood agar culture vary considerably but are generally in the range of 60\u201370%. Studies also have demonstrated that in circumstances when the colony counts are low, rapid tests are more likely to miss the presence of group A streptococcus. However, when the seroconversion of ASO titers is used as the gold standard for infection, rapid tests perform very well [69]. It is likely that rapid tests miss patients who have a small number of organisms and who are likely to be colonized instead of infected. Thus, rapid testing may be more specific in identifying patients with actual strep-related disease than cultures, which also identify those who are likely to be carriers. This comparison suggests that follow-up throat cultures are not necessary and may actually confuse treatment decisions. Rapid strep testing without culture also has been shown to be the most cost-effective approach to managing acute pharyngitis [73].",

Since a variety of conditions present with cough, there may have been some misclassification in generalizing this to acute bronchitis.",

These conditions are self-limited and currently are optimally treated with symptomatic medicines.Although the data are mixed regarding the utility of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis, otitis media, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics may have some benefit. Short-course therapy with narrow-spectrum antibiotics appropriate for the likely pathogen is recommended.\n",
