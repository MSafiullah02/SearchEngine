He had been discharged from a rehabilitation ward 1\u20132 days before this admission. His medical history included acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock over the previous year, and his present left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was reduced to 28%. Serial laboratory examinations showed no leukocytosis but neutrophil dominance (83.1%) and an elevated C-reactive protein (C-RP) level of 7.62 mg/dL. Sputum and blood culture analysis were performed on December 6, yielding negative findings. Thoracic radiography revealed a bilateral perihilar alveolar pattern,a dilated azygos vein, and diffuse pulmonary consolidations with air bronchograms in bilateral lower lung fields (Fig. 1\n). Accordingly, HAP accompanied by pulmonary edema was diagnosed. Empiric intravenous antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 h was promptly initiated on December 6, 2016.Nevertheless, the patient continued to experience fever and progressive cough with purulent sputum during antibiotic treatment. He asked for TCM combination therapy, which was started on December 9, 2016 (the 3rd hospital day).",

In fact, the patient had been treated with antibiotics and all the culture reports showed negative results. Therefore, TCM was prescribed to help patient with \u201cclearing heat and damp excreting\u201d and have some diuretic effects to improve pulmonary congestion. We suggest that TCM was helpful for the edema and sputum in this case for two reasons: First, after the administration of standard antibiotic therapy, the fever and the progressive cough with purulent sputum persisted. TCM was an extra intervention administered during the fever period. Second, because the bacterial cultures of sputum and blood were all negative before and after antibiotic treatment, the intermittent fever due to inflammatory reaction was highly suspicious after exclusion of other comment causes of fever, such as tumor fever and endocrine disorders. The \u201cclearing heat and damp excreting\u201d decoction we use was proven to have anti-inflammatory effects in a previous clinical trial and animal study. We suggest that the decreased time to fever abatement was caused by the improvement of lung inflammation after TCM adjuvant therapy.",
