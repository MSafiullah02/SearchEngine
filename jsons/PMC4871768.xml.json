MARC members are listed in the Appendix. The enrollment period was limited to months in which the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is most common in order to best characterize its epidemiology. As previously described, site investigators used a standardized protocol to enroll a target number of consecutive children with bronchiolitis age <2 years from the inpatient ward and ICU, with purposeful oversampling of ICU patients.11 All patients were treated at the discretion of the treating physician. Inclusion criteria were an attending physician's diagnosis of bronchiolitis, age <2 years, and the ability of the parent/guardian to provide informed consent. Patients were enrolled within 18 hours of admission. The exclusion criteria were previous enrollment or transfer to a participating hospital >48 hours after the original admission time. The consent and data collection forms were translated into Spanish. The institutional review boards at all participating hospitals approved the study.",

In our stratified regression models, children with in utero smoke exposure were more likely to be admitted to the ICU for bronchiolitis, independent of postnatal smoke exposure. Among children exposed to in utero maternal smoking, the adjusted odds for ICU admission increased from 1.47 to 1.95 for those children also exposed to smoke after birth. Although an interesting finding, the relatively small numbers (after stratification) and overlapping confidence intervals make this conclusion somewhat speculative. Others, however, have found similar relationships. Specifically, Li and colleagues20 found that among children with asthma, in utero exposure to maternal smoking was independently associated with deficits in lung function. Subsequent postnatal TSE did not result in additional loss of lung function. Overall, our results support the concept that prenatal smoking is a significant determinant of bronchiolitis severity, as defined by admission to an ICU.",

Ideally, counseling messages conveyed by physicians who care for children could be coupled with delivery of effective smoking cessation interventions. A recent systematic review published by the Cochrane Collaboration examined the body of literature regarding the efficacy of such interventions for parents who smoke. In a variety of clinical settings, the effectiveness of parental education and counseling programs on reducing children's TSE was not clearly demonstrated.21 However, among studies of parents of children with respiratory illnesses, 4 of 13 studies showed significant effects on child health outcomes22, 23 and/or smoking cessation.24, 25 Studies that showed efficacy primarily used intensive counseling or motivational interviewing methods, which may hold the greatest potential for reducing the morbidity associated with TSE in children.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. Although a significant number of children required admission to the ICU, endotracheal intubation was a relatively rare event, precluding a detailed analysis of the effects of smoke exposure on this outcome. We may have been unable to detect differences in chronic lung disease or extreme prematurity as a result of the small number of children with this history in our cohort. We defined postnatal TSE as exposure to any individual (living with, regularly visiting, or caring for the child) who ever smoked tobacco in the same room as the child. We did not collect details about secondhand smoke exposure during the prenatal period. This may underestimate in utero TSE, particularly in the 168 children whose mothers did not report smoking while pregnant but had postnatal TSE. However, some of these children may have had postnatal TSE only in a child care setting without in utero exposure. Infants of mothers who smoke in the same room have a higher risk of hospitalization for respiratory infections than infants whose mothers smoke after birth, but not in the same room.29 Among children with in utero exposure to maternal smoking, subsequent postnatal TSE (n = 115) was less common than no subsequent TSE (n = 216). Although some mothers may have quit smoking during pregnancy, underreporting of postnatal TSE may have occurred. Alternatively, some mothers who continued to smoke after birth may not have smoked in the same room as their infant, causing failure of some of these infants to meet our definition of postnatal TSE. Although infants of mothers who smoked elsewhere (eg, outside) may still have experienced significant smoke exposure,30 this potential underestimation does not detract from the prenatal smoke exposure finding. We relied on caregiver report of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and postnatal TSE. It was not feasible from a cost standpoint to obtain biochemical confirmation of TSE with cotinine levels given the specific aims of our original cohort study.",

One small study of hospitalized children and their families demonstrated that a structured caregiver interview for the presence of secondhand smoking in any location had 100% sensitivity for child cotinine levels of >1 mg/dL.31 In contrast, a recent systematic review demonstrated the increased sensitivity of salivary cotinine compared to self-report, which tended to underestimate smoking prevalence.32 Some have suggested that parent report of smoking status, the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and smoking restrictions in the home are reasonable estimates of children's urinary cotinine levels when taken together.33 We did not collect all of these details about parental smoking habits. Using questions similar to ours, a provocative analysis of a prospective cohort of children admitted for asthma found that although serum and salivary cotinine levels were associated with readmission for asthma, caregiver report was not.34 Their results may reflect a bias toward underreporting TSE in the inpatient setting. If the same potential for misclassification applies to smoking during pregnancy, our finding of a strong association between maternal smoking and risk of ICU admission is more noteworthy.",
