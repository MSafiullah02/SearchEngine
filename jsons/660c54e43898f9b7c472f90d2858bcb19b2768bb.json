Five major groups of reservoirs were identified by cluster analysis based on species associations. Of 29 reservoirs surveyed previously, 76% were classified into the same species associations from one survey to the next. When 19 environmental variables were used in canonical correlation analysis of the five reservoir groups, I found a general east-to-west separation of species associations by water quality and a northwest-to-southeast separation by surface elevation and growing season. A discriminant functions model based on a reduced set of nine environmental variables had an unbiased error rate of 18% for predicting the species association in unclassified reservoirs. A stratified sampling scheme based on the classification model decreased the variance of statewide electrofishing catch per effort up to 43% for bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and 23% for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides over a simple random sample of reservoirs.",

The geographic size and diversity of the state, combined with limited resources for managing all public waters, make it impossible to monitor fishery resources annually in all bodies of water throughout the state. An empirically derived reservoir classification scheme would allow managers to stratify monitoring programs by reservoir types. This could be accomplished by identifying reservoir groups from patterns offish community composition and by deriving relationships within these groups among physical and biotic factors. Such a classification scheme might improve the efficiency of a monitoring program for assessing the status of the resource throughout the state.",

I used canonical correlation (CANDISC procedure: SAS 1985) to analyze the relation between the reservoir species associations and a set of 19 limnological and morphometric variables usually measured or easily obtained by fishery managers. This technique is appealing because it can aid managers by illustrating objectively the extent to which one set of variables (e.g., environmental attributes) is related to another set (e.g., species associations). Canonical correlation produces linear functions (canonical variables) of the environmental variables with the highest possible multiple correlation with the reservoir groups (clusters). Variables with the highest canonical coefficients in each of these linear functions are assumed to define that function. Therefore, the key variables relating the two data sets may be assessed from each pair of coefficient vectors (canonical equations).",

Analysis was based on nine limnological and morphometric variables measured for 52 Texas reservoirs surveyed during 1975-1984. sociations as a result of within-year variation of environmental factors. Therefore, this classification model does not provide insight into intrareservoir dynamics, such as predicting how a species may respond to a particular management practice. Cluster analysis of data from earlier surveys classified most reservoirs into the same species associations as occurred for the most recent survey. This suggests that summer species associations are relatively constant among years in most Texas reservoirs. Changes in species compositions between multiple surveys were attributed to a shift in relative abundance of key species that contributed to the original group classification. Therefore, fishery managers should be able to detect real changes in species composition that may require closer investigation and possible changes in management practices.",

The classification model developed for Wisconsin lakes by Tonn et al. (1983) had an implied classification error rate of 0% but an unbiased rate of 14% estimated by jackknife techniques (W. M. Tonn, University of Al- berta, personal communication). In the present study, the reservoir classification model had a biased error rate of 10% versus 18% obtained by cross-validation. These validation techniques illustrate the importance of obtaining unbiased error rates because the error rate obtained with a classification model that uses all of the data implies that the model is more precise than it actually is. In the absence of new data for testing the classification model, cross-validation or jackknife methods are satisfactory for estimating unbiased error rates for classifying reservoirs. Newly surveyed reservoirs can be classified into species associations with known reliability by these models, but the models' error rates may prompt fishery managers to search for more precise models. My study demonstrates that an objective classification scheme can be derived from annual resource-monitoring data taken over large environmental and geographic ranges. As stated by Tonn et al. (1983) , the prediction success of the model may diminish when it is used to classify other reservoirs that fall outside the range of the limnological variables in the original set of reservoirs. However, the goal in my study was to develop a comprehensive classification scheme for all major reservoirs in Texas. Therefore, because reservoirs are surveyed each year, the classification scheme could be updated with new survey data.",
