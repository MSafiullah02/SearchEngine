Problems associated with the management of infections in these patients include difficulties in early diagnosis because the clinical signs of infection are subtle, the low performance of diagnostic tests, and suboptimal response to treatment because recovery of host defenses is a key factor for resolution of infection. Preventing these infections relies on infection control measures and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. While infection control measures are safe (but not always effective), the use of antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis of infection is not devoid of problems. Its wide use may increase the possibility of the development of resistance, select for resistant organisms, and increase toxicity and cost. Therefore, any attempt to administer an antimicrobial agent should be accompanied by a reflection of the potential benefits and risks of prophylaxis.",

Likewise, the shorter is the period at risk (and therefore the predicted duration of prophylaxis), the higher is the possibility that prophylaxis will work. However, the prediction of an incidence of infection is not simple, and requires an analysis of various factors including patient\u2019s prior exposure to pathogens, underlying disease, previous and current treatment, comorbidities, geographic area, and others. Therefore, three questions are critical in defining the appropriateness of antimicrobial prophylaxis: what is the risk for infection; what are the pathogens that predominate in this setting; and what is the period at risk. In this chapter, we describe various strategies directed at the prevention of infections in patients with hematological malignancies, according to this risk-based strategy.",

In addition, health care workers should also wash their hands between patients. All surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned, including wrists, palms, back of hands, fingers, and under the fingernails, preferably with an alcohol-based hand rub [2]. However, if hands are visibly dirty or soiled with blood or body fluids, soap and water are best for cleaning hands [3]. Additional recommendations include the removal of rings prior to handwashing, keeping nails short and clean, and avoiding the use of artificial nails as they may carry pathogens [4].",

These patients are at greater risk of developing bacterial infections, particularly by encapsulated bacteria. Intravenous immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg) every 4 weeks may be effective for the prevention of bacterial infections, and this recommendation is supported by randomized controlled studies [38\u201340]. However, since its use is costly, intravenous immunoglobulin should be reserved to a selected population of patients with repeated episodes of severe infections. A meta-analysis of nine studies comparing intravenous immunoglobulin with a control group in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma did not show any survival benefit of immunoglobulin prophylaxis. However, a reduction in the incidence of major infections and of clinically documented infections was observed. The authors concluded that intravenous immunoglobulin should not be recommended routinely [41]. A cheaper alternative to immunoglobulin is to give quinolone prophylaxis with levofloxacin (500 mg/day), moxifloxacin (400 mg/day), or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (TMP-SMX) (Table 49.4) [42].",

A recent meta-analysis of itraconazole trials suggest that there is a reduction in Aspergillus infections but only if a certain threshold of bioavailable dosing is used [58].

These findings, however, should be balanced against our significantly improved ability for the early detection of fungal infections and the potential undesirable consequences including toxicities, drug\u2013drug interactions, costs, and emergence of resistance [63]. The application of serial serum galactomannan monitoring has enabled us to make the diagnosis of IA much earlier, with a significant impact in reducing mortality [56]. Indeed, in the trial comparing voriconazole and fluconazole, screening with twice-weekly serum galactomannan was part of the protocol in the two arms, and appropriate antifungal therapy was started based on positive galactomannan tests.

In general, the higher the risk, the more likely anti-mold prophylaxis should be given. Therefore, risk assessment (Table 49.1) should be performed in order to decide the best strategy. Patients at high risk to develop IFD should receive anti-mold prophylaxis, while low-risk patients can be managed with fluconazole plus active monitoring with serial (3\u00d7/week) serum galactomannan and CT scans, provided that these tools are available in the hospital [64]. Clinicians should keep in mind that this risk assessment is dynamic. For example, a patient with AML who was considered at low risk on admission but presents residual blast cells on day 15 of admission should be reclassified to a higher risk and the prophylactic regimen should be changed accordingly [64].",

The application of preemptive therapy guided by serial monitoring with CMV antigenemia has markedly reduced the incidence of patients who develop overt manifestations and/or die of CMV pneumonia [75]. More recently, quantitative PCR for the detection of CMV DNA and CMV RNA have been introduced as alternatives for the antigenemia [76, 77]. Since these techniques are more sensitive than antigenemia, a threshold for starting preemptive therapy should be established for every group of patients; in other words, a specific number of copies of CMV DNA above which triggers the institution of preemptive therapy in allogeneic HCT may not be the same for patients with less severe immunodeficiency. Indeed, the application of these sensitive biomarkers has revealed that hosts not thought to be at risk for CMV reactivation may indeed have positive CMV PCR quite frequently [78]. Outside the setting of allogeneic HCT, patients at higher risk to develop CMV reactivation includepatients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving fludarabine or (especially) alemtuzumab [79], patients with multiple myeloma receiving highly intensive therapies [80], and autologous HCT recipients treated previously with rituximab [81].",
