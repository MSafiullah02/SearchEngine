The estimated rate of short-term death from the virus ranges between 2 and 7%, depending on the number of patients tested in a specific region. A variable number of patients need hospitalization (10-40%), with an average length of stay ranging between two and three weeks; two consecutive negative tests are required before discharge. Twelve percent of patients need ICU admission. 2 Occupancy of the ICU is very fluid; during April 3-6 in Lombardy it reached between 90 and 95% of maximum occupancy. 1 On this dramatic background, cardiovascular care in these regions has been significantly affected. In Lombardy, for example, hospitals have canceled office visits and routine elective diagnostic examinations (echocardiography, stress tests, coronary CT scans, etc.). Many hospitals have canceled invasive procedures, and even in hospitals where these procedures are still taking place, the rate has dropped 80-90%. Transcatheter aortic valve implantations are currently suspended across the region except for three centers, with only a few centers performing percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty as a bridge. Given these dramatic changes in the daily activities of the cardiovascular centers, it is imperative to anticipate the impact of these measures on the hard clinical outcomes of our patients with cardiovascular disease.",
