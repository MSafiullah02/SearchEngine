Now, in the wake of a mass death incident, the bodies are soon controlled by the medical examiner or coroner and not released until he/she is satisfied \u2013 first that they have been properly identified, perhaps from dental records, fingerprints or DNA; and second, if there is any reason to suspect foul play, that the cause of death has also been established. The result is that there is rarely a surge of bodies into the funereal system but rather a steady flow of human remains as persons are identified. Sometimes that flow can last for days, months, or even longer, as was true after 9/11 or the Indian Ocean tsunami\u2010hit tourist areas in Thailand.",

            "text": "In most cases, the response by the authorities is based on the generic mass death plan developed by the International Police Criminal Organization (Interpol, 1997). That plan assumes that the dead will be at a site, that this site will be controlled by law enforcement, that no human remains will be moved until they are marked and photographed in place, and that then they will be moved to a morgue where they will be examined by pathologists, odontologists (forensic dentists), fingerprint specialists and others until they are identified. That is what happened in December 1985, when a chartered aircraft carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne crashed in a wooded area, meters from the airport in Gander, Newfoundland. The crash area was cordoned off, staked out and each body was marked and photographed before being taken to a morgue set up in an unused hangar at the airport (Emergency Communications Research Unit, 1985).",

            "text": "The situation is different, however, when the cause of mass death is a pandemic. After a disaster, identifying the dead is a key priority even if intact bodies are not recovered. In a pandemic, because most of those who die do so at home or in a healthcare setting, identification is rarely an issue; and, in any case, all bodies are intact. After a disaster, cause of death may be a concern especially if criminal activity or terrorism is suspected. After both Air India and Pan Am 103 blew apart in mid\u2010air, bodies and body parts were examined carefully to see if they could help determine the source of the explosive devices. During a pandemic, because cause of death is usually obvious, there is no need for post mortems. After a disaster there is nothing to prevent normal funereal rites, such as wakes, funeral services and a ceremony at the cemetery when a body was buried. In a pandemic, bringing people together risks contagion. Wakes and funerals are prohibited. In a disaster, emergency agencies are usually not among the victims: in a pandemic, emergency personnel, especially front\u2010line medical staff, are often victims (Johnson, 1997). That is much less likely in a disaster. Finally, after a disaster, it is usually possible to get assistance from neighboring communities. Mutual aid is part of most emergency plans. In a pandemic such assistance may not be available because the impact will be widespread.",

            "text": "At first glance, those differences would suggest that planning for disaster death and planning for pandemic death should be done separately and, to some extent, that is happening. Canada, for example, has an annex to its Pandemic Influenza Emergency Plan providing \u201cGuidelines for the Management of Mass Fatalities during an Influenza Pandemic\u201d (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2010). The US Department of Health and Human Services states one of its priorities is to \u201cassist communities with surge mortuary services to accommodate a large number of expected fatalities\u201d (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2005, p. 25). The British are still assuming all types of mass death will be dealt with the same way: their planning document emphasizes that it \u201cwill be the aim of local service providers to maintain current processes for as long as possible\u201d (Home Office, 2007, p. 12). This approach has been criticized by Her Majesty's Coroners; and the government has consulted many who would be involved to see if that approach makes sense (Home Office, n.d.). It seems likely that there will be changes in UK planning.",

            "text": "However, while there are major differences between disaster mass death and pandemic mass death, a closer look at the two suggests there are also many parallels. Both pandemics and disasters can lead to problems of locating and collecting the dead. Both can lead to identification issues. Both require paperwork as death is recorded and certified. Both can lead to shortages of facilities and personnel: even finding enough persons to dig graves can be an issue. Both require decisions about whether there should be mass graves. Both can have a widespread impact, making it difficult for communities to assist each other. Both can impact emergency personnel. These similarities suggest planning for both should be done if not by a single entity, then at least in parallel. While this article draws substantially on Canadian material, it includes examples from the USA to show that the issues there are much the same. The limited material available from UK sources suggests that this would also be true for the UK. In short, if Canada, the USA or the UK experience a repeat of the 1918\u20101920 pandemic there will be problems dealing with the dead, many of them comparable to what happens after a major mass death disaster. Planners should keep that in mind.",

The first detailed studies were done about 30 years ago when researchers at the Disaster Research Center, then at Ohio State University, studied a number of American mass death incidents (Blanshan, 1977; Blanshan and Quarantelli, n.d.; Hershiser, 1974; Hershiser and Quarantelli, 1976, 1979; Quarantelli, 1979). There were also publications by Vanderlyn Pine (1969a, b, 1974, 1980), a funeral director and sociologist, Janet Kitz's (1994) chapter in Ground Zero on the 1917 Halifax explosion mortuary, articles by Japanese physicians after the 1995 Kobe earthquake and two journal articles by Joseph Scanlon, one also on Halifax (Nishimura, 1997a, b, c; Scanlon, 1998a; Scanlon and McCullum, 1999). There were technical articles, some by Canadians (Brannon and Kessler, 1999; Brenner, 2005; Clark et al., 1989; Pretty et al., 2001a, b). Now, thanks to US National Science Foundation (NSF) funding, there is new extensive published research on disaster death (Scanlon, 1998a, 2006a, b, 2008, 2009; Scanlon and McCullum, 1999; Scanlon et al., 2007). As well as overviews, it covers such topics as the problems of foreign ministry call centers handling inquiries and the role of the private sector in disaster victim identification (Scanlon, 2006b, 2007).",

Instead of bodies being at an easily controllable site, they are often spread over a wide area. Instead of being left in place until they are photographed and data about them is recorded, they are often collected by ordinary persons and taken to public locations such as schools, police stations, churches and recreational facilities. That happened in Darwin (Australia) after a cyclone, in Rapid City (South Dakota) after a flood, and in Kobe (Japan) after an earthquake (Hershiser, 1974; Scanlon, 1979; Nishimura 1997a, b, c). However, that research also suggests that once that initial response is over, the handling of the dead is taken over by law enforcement and forensic professionals and those who knew the dead are excluded until the dead are identified. Only then are the bodies released so their families can carry out whatever rites they wish. That is exactly what happened in Thailand after the Indian Ocean tsunami: the bodies were collected and laid out in rows on the grounds of temples but gradually they were taken under control by foreign police and forensic scientists operating with the permission of the Thai government (Scanlon, 2006b). Only after they were formally identified were they released to relatives.",

In Sri Lanka, for example, after the tsunami, the mosques used their public address systems to warn that unless people quickly identified a body, it would be buried in a mass grave. One reason for this was a conviction \u2013 though incorrect \u2013 that bodies constituted a disease threat. In Indonesia, where there were thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands dead, there were hasty efforts to identify some dead before most were buried in mass graves. In Canada, as recently as Hurricane Hazel, which struck the Toronto area in 1954, bodies were collected by volunteers, and identified by those who knew them or said they knew them. When two university students volunteered to assist and it was learned one was a medical student, the pair found themselves running a makeshift morgue:Behind the partition, the now Dr Elliot Baker and I were accepting incoming bodies. Our job of setting up and administrating the morgue turned out to be one of cleaning the bodies as best we could and searching for some identification. We would then write a brief description of the body and where it was found, tag the toes, and give the description to the Salvation Army. Here, behind the partition, we had three rows of bodies, men, women, and children in order of age. Each body was covered with a blanket (Kennedy, 1976, pp. 125\u20106).",

Because only one relatively intact body was recovered after the crash of Swissair 111, the passengers and crew were identified using various forensic techniques; but when the oil rig Ocean Ranger, an American\u2010flagged vessel, capsized in the Atlantic off Newfoundland, since most bodies were intact, the identities were confirmed by persons who knew the dead and by personal effects on the bodies[2].

            "text": "There is also now a great deal of literature on pandemics, especially on the 1918\u20101920 Spanish flu (major works about the American and world situation include Barry, 2004; Bollet, 2004; Crosby, 1976, 1989; Galishoff, 1969; Katz, 1974; Nikiforuk, 1991; Persico, 1976; Peters, 2005; Rose, 1937; Rosenberg, 1992; Starr, 1976). More specifically, there is a wide range of books, chapters, articles and papers about what happened in Canada during the 1918\u20101920 influenza pandemic (important Canadian works include Andrews, 1977; Bacic, 1999; Belyk and Belyk, 1988; Herring, 1994; Herring and Sattenspiel, 2003; Humphries, 2005; Johnson, 1997; Jones, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007; Keer, 1994; Kelm, 1999; Lux, 1997; MacDougall, 1986, 2007; McGinnis, 1976, 1981; O'Keefe and MacDonald, 2004; Palmer et al., 2007; Pettigrew, 1983; Phillips, 2004; Quiney, 2002)[3]. This literature continues to expand: Johnson, whose early research was done in Kitchener, Ontario, recently produced a book on the British experience in 1918\u20101920 based on his doctoral dissertation at Cambridge (Johnson, 2006). Despite this extensive and growing literature, there is still nothing focusing on pandemic death[4]. Nevertheless, accounts dating back to the seventeenth century show that dealing with the dead has always been a major problem in pandemics. Miquel Parets (1991), writing about the plague that struck Barcelona in 1665, vividly describes the collection of bodies:It was terrifying to see the carts [\u2026] move through the streets filled with the dead, some fully dressed and others naked, some wrapped in sheets and others with only their shifts on [\u2026] and there were so many that anyone going through the streets constantly ran into them (p. 55).",

Although the patients' names had been attached to their beds when they were brought in, many of them had got up and wandered in their delirium.

The hastily formed Halifax Relief Committee ordered a morgue created in the basement of Chedebucto School. After a mine incident, often one of the mine buildings is set up as a morgue. But morgues have also been set up in armories, unused hangars at airports and military bases, hockey rinks, school basements, a town hall, a movie theatre, an empty store, a pizza parlor or a church hall. Bodies have also been taken to a church hall (Molly Corbett Beaton Institute, n.d.). In 1916, after forest fires killed hundreds of persons in Northern Ontario, one small morgue was set up at McNabb's funeral home in Cobalt. The main morgue was in Matheson, where two tents were used to handle bodies. There were piles of coffins beside the tents, some labeled \u201cfull\u201d and others labelled \u201cempty\u201d. Soldiers collected bodies of humans and horses and brought the human bodies to the tent morgues (The Daily Nugget, 1916). An overcrowded funeral home is an even greater problem if the only funeral director is ill, as happened in Cranbrook, British Columbia in 1918:When the local undertaker fell ill there was no one to prepare for burial the flood of flu victims. Fourteen\u2010year\u2010old Frank Robert's father assumed the role of mortuary caretaker during the absence of the undertaker. One night the boy accompanied his father to the funeral parlour to check on the furnace. After entering the building through the back door, his father pulled the cord on a bare overhead bulb. The flood of light suddenly revealed a ghastly sight. The room was full of bodies; so many that they were stacked like firewood (Belyk and Belyk, 1988, p. 48).",

Willis Martin offered ten dollars a day to anyone who would touch a corpse, but that proved inadequate, and still the bodies piled up [\u2026] The city and archdiocese turned to construction equipment, using steam shovels to dig trenches for mass graves (p. 327).Crosby (1989) describes much the same:On September 10, 500 bodies awaited burial and the undertaking establishments, coffin manufacturers, and grave diggers were falling further and further behind [\u2026] At times the city morgue had as many as ten times as many bodies as coffins [\u2026] Six wagons and a motor truck toured the city and collected 221 corpses which had gone without burial for one to four days since death (p. 82).The usual complement of grave diggers was far too small to dig the number of graves required. Various city departments, including the House of Detention, sent men to cemeteries and they, plus volunteers, did the job. The Bureau of Highways offered a steam shovel to dig trenches in Potter's Field for the burial of the poor and friendless. Such was the confusion and the speed with which the dead were thrust into the ground that it was apparent that there would be some, perhaps many, cases in which relatives would want to move their dead to family plots or even to other cemeteries, so the bodies were tagged for identification if they should later be disinterred (Crosby, 1989, p. 83).Johnson (2006) notes precisely the same problems in the UK during the 1918\u20101920 pandemic:[\u2026] a massive strain on the economies, on families, on medical personnel and facilities, and even on cemeteries and morgues. The funeral industry showed the strain as many towns ran out of coffins and coffin makers, grave diggers and others were put on extended hours, while cemeteries opened for longer hours (p. 206).",

A large hole was dug in the cemetery, and seven bodies were carefully wrapped and buried side by side (Hanson, 2001, p. 45).It was about December 8th, when we began to dig a large grave in which to bury all the people who had died during the epidemic. This was no easy matter, as the ground had already frozen to a great depth. When we got down to about three feet we came to the old frost and we were obliged to make large fires and we used up a considerable quantity of petroleum, otherwise we should not have been able to get down far enough. In this way we dug down to 7 or 8 feet and the length of the grave was 32 feet (Moran, 1988, p. 25).",

In a pandemic, the impacts \u2013 and the problems of dealing with the dead \u2013 are usually spread over wide areas, perhaps over much of the world. That makes it difficult for one community, one region or one country to provide assistance to another. While that is less common in a disaster, it can happen. During the 1998 Eastern Ontario ice storm, 65 communities declared a state of emergency at the same time (Scanlon, 1999). That made mutual aid difficult to impossible and made it very difficult for the provincial government to provide effective support. Not surprisingly the Regional Municipality of Ottawa Carleton called upon the Army to assist. There were similar problems during an earlier ice storm that struck the area around Rochester, New York. Similarly, while it is true that pandemics are more likely to impact emergency personnel than disasters that is not always the case. When the munitions ship exploded in Halifax in 1917, it killed all the senior officers of the fire department and injured so many soldiers and soldiers' families that the military was unable to respond for some time to the needs of the civilian population.",

He puts these as questions:1. Is there a manifest, a list of the dead?2. How many dead are there?3. What condition are the bodies in?4. How fast are bodies being recovered?He argues that the problems are greatest when there is no list, when there are many dead, when the bodies are disfigured or cut to pieces and when most of all the dead are recovered quickly. Given those criteria, the tsunami was a close to a worst\u2010case scenario. There was no list. There were hundreds of thousands of bodies. They were recovered very quickly. The only positive was that most bodies were in good condition.",

Bodies were recovered very quickly. The numbers were not necessarily that large on a local basis but the overall totals were overwhelming.

In a pandemic cause of death may be ascribed to a number of things but the underlying cause is clear \u2013 whatever it was that caused the pandemic. In 1918\u20101920 that cause was swine flu. However, it is also clear that there are often many similarities between both types of mass death. There may well be problems in locating and collecting the dead. There will be problems with paper work. There will be shortages of supplies such as body bags and personnel such as grave diggers. Given widespread impact there may be an inability for communities to assist each other.",
