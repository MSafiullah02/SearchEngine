The first is research at the molecular level to define the virus' life cycle in its quest to produce progeny virus and then screen for pharmacologic drugs that block reproductive stages of that life cycle. To gain knowledge of what self-components the virus requires to allow its survival and production of progeny while interacting with the host, enormous computerized libraries of known chemicals or synthesized compounds are searched. The goal is to identify molecules with the ability to block viral replication. Such assays require a robust readout and automation involving robotics to screen virtually millions of test molecules to identify just a few that show promise. Any molecule identified requires, first, confirmation and, then, analysis that it is not toxic by itself. Thereafter, chemists study and modify its structure to optimize the therapeutic index, that is, the relative safety of a dose or treatment as opposed to its potentially harmful effect.",

Examples are discoveries of drugs that changed HIV/AIDS infection from a near-routinely lethal event (mortality .90%) to a 1% or less death rate for HIV patients who are medicated daily. However, these drugs are expensive and not always available in some countries. Similarly, the antiviral therapy recently discovered for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) now cures over 95% of such patients instead of the lifetime persistent infection their predecessors suffered. Additionally, the risk of developing liver cancer and needing a liver transplant is greatly diminished. Although anti-HCV therapy is initially expensive, compared to the former long-term hospitalization, likely transplant surgery, or cancer treatment, the long-term cost is modest and the value is great for patients as well as for the health care system.",

            "text": "The second approach in the development of treatments for human viral diseases is harnessing the host's immune response. The immune system has evolved to enable the host to resist invasion by organisms like, in this case, Ebola virus. Proteins in Ebola that trigger an immune response are called antigens (immunogens). A host's immune response to antigens can travel down two very different pathways. The most common and satisfactory one provides protection, controls the infection by either preventing it totally or lessening (attenuating) its effects, and induces a protective immune response. Such a response can provide long-term protection from Ebola virus so that a repeated infection does not cause disease-sort of one and done. To mimic that scenario, a vaccine is created to prime the immune response by programming it to recognize and then rapidly resist the Ebola infection in an individual who later becomes exposed to a person, animal, or substance contaminated with Ebola virus. Vaccines developed against viruses like measles, mumps, smallpox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis have changed the human and medical landscapes in that they succeeded in reducing the morbidity and mortality of human viral diseases. This success stands as one of the greatest of public health advancements. For example, smallpox alone in the 20th century killed an estimated 300 million individuals, about threefold more than all the wars of that century, including World Wars I and II. Vaccination eliminated smallpox so that, in the 21st century, not a single case has emerged. 2 Similarly, if one is infected by Ebola and survives, that person is immune to reinfection. Indeed, during the 2013\u00c016 Ebola outbreak, such \"naturally immune\" individuals, because of their resistance to reinfection by Ebola, often worked to provide care and transport patients.",

            "text": "The immune system must discriminate between foreign antigens, such as viral proteins, that are not found in humans (nonself) and those antigens that are self (proteins in your own cells and tissues). Crossreactivity of a person's immune response to the virus with the individual's own \"self-proteins\" can lead to an autoimmune (antiself) response-a response to self-components, and autoimmune diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, or thyroiditis. 3 After an initial exposure to viral infection, the so-called acute phase, a race is on between the virus, which is replicating rapidly, and the host's immune system, which functions first to limit the amount of virus made and second to clear the virus from the host. At stake is whether the virus can successfully replicate itself. To combat the virus, the host mobilizes and uses many weapons, that is, both the immunologically specific and nonspecific responses. The nonspecific factors are all early combatants against the virus and the cells it infects. Included in this group are natural killer lymphoid cells, phagocytic macrophages-large cells that ingest or eat viruses-and proteins in the blood called complement factors that are capable of interacting with viruses and also destroying virus-infected cells. Important is the innate immune system that provides the initial defense against pathogens and primes the subsequent adoptive (T cell and antibody) immune response. The major players in the innate immune response are tolllike receptors, which recognize particular microbial patterns, and type 1 interferons (IFNs). Again, there are conflicting reports of whether IFNs are suppressed or exaggerated. Nevertheless, these innate systems are mutually complementary and are involved in developing the ensuing adoptive immune response. Type 1 IFNs upregulate molecules on cells that present major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, molecules that code for self. MHC molecules are essential for optimal interaction with T cells. Following a virus infection or vaccination, major antigen-presenting cells (called dendritic cells) present segments of viral proteins (peptides) that become located within MHC molecules to na\u00efve T cells, an action termed \"priming.\" By this means virusspecific T cells are generated and expanded numerically. These T cells are made in the infected host for the specific control of a virus infection. Thus, the major combatants against viruses are antibodies and T lymphocytes, both of which mount the host immune response to Ebola, although the relative contribution of each is not unknown. However, in this battle, within 10\u00c014 days after infection, either the replicating viruses or the host's immune response will emerge as the winner. If the immune response wins, viruses are vanquished, and the host survives with enduring immunity to that virus. However, if the immune response is overcome, the Ebola virus infection ends in the host's death or in a subset of individuals fingerprints of Ebola that can be found months later. 4, 5 What is the cellular (T cell) virus-specific immune response? The component parts are CD81 and CD41 T cells. The T stands for thymus-derived, and CD81 or CD41 indicates a specific molecule present on the cells' surface used to identify the cell. The thymus is a two-lobed gland of the lymphoid system located over the heart and under the breastbone. Lymphocytes formed in the bone marrow (hemopoietic stem cells) migrate to and enter the thymus where they are educated (mature) and are then selected to become either CD81 or CD41 T cells. CD81 T cells function as surveillance and killer cells, which accounts for their name \"cytotoxic T lymphocytes\" (CTLs). They travel along the highways of blood vessels and wander among tissues throughout the body seeking cells that are foreign (not like self), because they express viral proteins. CTLs then recognize, attack, and kill such cells. By this strategy they eliminate the factories making viruses. CD81 T cells also release soluble factors like interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) that also have antiviral effects but do so without killing the virus-infected cell. CD41 T cells predominantly serve a different role. They release soluble materials (proteins) that help or induce bone marrow-derived (nonthymic-educated) B lymphocytes to differentiate and make antibodies. CD41 T cells release soluble factors (cytokines) that also participate in clearing a virus infection and, uncommonly, CD41 T cells may also kill virally infected cells.",

By this means, antibodies decrease a host's content of virus and diminish infectivity. Antibodies lower the number of viruses thereby allowing CTLs to work more efficiently. Antibodies along with effector molecules like complement can kill virus-infected cells. However, this mechanism is relatively inefficient compared to CTL killing of virus-infected cells. Although over 100,000 or more viral antigens must be present on the surface of a virus-infected cell to achieve lysis by antibody, less than 10 viral antigens expressed on a cell and restricted by MHC are all that are needed for a CD8 T cell to do the job. Thus, during infection, the eradication of virus-infected cells is the primary job of CTLs, whereas antibody's main task is to curtail the spread of virus in body fluids.",

            "text": "During an onset of acute viral infection, the mechanics of obtaining sufficient virus-specific CD8 T cells in humans to transfer into a MHC-matched individual is barely doable, even when attempted as a research study in a sophisticated clinical research center in an optimal hospital setting in the West. This task is not feasible during an Ebola infection in Africa. Yet, the transfer of convalescent plasma (plasma is blood from which red cells have been removed) harvested from Ebolaimmune donors into acutely ill Ebola patients is possible. Such \"immune\" plasma (plasma containing antibodies to Ebola) can be placed in storage and thus remain available. The million dollar questions are-does this protocol work and, if so, is it of therapeutic value. For such transfers, blood is harvested in heparinized tubes to prevent clotting. T cells, red blood cells, macrophages, etc., are removed by centrifugation, and the resultant plasma is injected intravenously into the infected patient. In clinical trials with 84 patients of various ages acutely infected with Ebola virus, 200\u00c0250 mL of inoculum was tested. This plasma was harvested from previously infected Ebola patients who survived the disease. 6 Unfortunately, though, the survival rate of patients in the trial did not improve significantly over that of the controls who were not so-inoculated. However, the study was flawed in that neutralizing antibodies to Ebola were not quantitated or adjusted in the transferred plasma. Thus, exactly why the trial failed is not clear; was the entire procedure flawed or was the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma simply too low. 6 In other studies, potent neutralizing antibodies against Ebola were isolated from B cell clones of immune individuals who had recovered from Ebola infections. One such antibody, mAb114, given only once, protected 3 of 3 macaques even when administered as late as 5 days into the infection cycle. 7 The one macaque given no neutralizing antibody died at day 10 postinfection with 10 8 logs of virus. Similarly, potent neutralizing antibodies were isolated from a survivor of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and 77% of the 349 monoclonal antibodies isolated neutralized Ebola indicating that a broad diversity of B cell clones target sites on the Ebola glycoproteins generated during infection. 8 Impetus to develop this strategy further came from these results with Ebola, and the same method was used in other animal/virus models. For example, monoclonal antibodies proved to protect guinea pigs from hemorrhagic arenavirus (Junin) infection of Argentina 9 and anti-HIV-1 antibodies prevented that infection in a monkey model. 10 An important consideration underlying the proposed development of an Ebola vaccine was the fact that human survivors of the initial infection resisted reinfection when later exposed to Ebola. Such observations provided the scientific rationale and the logic for financial investment by government agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and charitable foundations to obtain an effective vaccine against Ebola. Less attention came from large pharmaceutical companies whose perspective was commercial. That is, even if successful, the vaccine would be used in as yet, nonindustrial (still third world) countries; therefore, the market for that vaccine would be smaller and less profitable than in industrialized Western countries. Also, because of its highly lethal nature, Ebola would require specialized facilities for handling and testing. Finally, insufficient data were available about the early events in human processing of Ebola virus infection.",

Brantly came across the report in Nature 12 that ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies to neutralize Ebola, saved monkeys challenged with a lethal dose of Ebola even when they were several days into their illness. However, ZMapp had been tested only in cultured cells or animals and was not yet known to be harmless or effective in humans. Nevertheless, Brantly selected ZMapp as his choice. Was the material available? Lance Plyler contacted Gary Kobinger in Canada who was involved in the creation and testing of ZMapp. Plyler requested that the drug be sent to Samaritan's Purse Hospital for its immediate use. Kobinger informed Plyler that the nearest supply of the drug was only 480 miles away from the ELWA facility at the Doctors without Borders Kailahun Care Facility, where Khan was near death. Concerning Khan, the debate continued whether or not he should receive ZMapp. Plyler requested the drug and arranged for a helicopter to take ZMapp from the Doctors Without Borders Care Center to Monrovia.",

ZMapp had been sent to West Africa to the Doctors Without Borders Care Center in Kailahun primarily to determine how the drug would hold up in the African environment of heat and electrical power failures. The plan was to then return the drug to Canada and re-evaluate its antiviral efficacy: was it stable; was there a loss in potency? Although a promising anti-Ebola therapeutic, ZMapp had not attracted robust funds for its development. In a CBS News interview, Dr. Jeffrey D. Turner, President and CEO of Defyrus, a private life sciences biodefense company that collaborated with public government public health agencies and military partners in the United Kingdom and Canada, stated \"The challenge that many people don't appreciate is that our plans were to scale up this drug for 2015 and even then, small amounts for clinical trials. What has really happened with this outbreak is it's caught us in a position where we didn't have enough ZMapp available because no one would have bought it.\"",

The genes encoding the monoclonal antibodies made elsewhere were inserted in these plants and the plants then produced large quantities of the antibody. However, the procedure required several weeks. Thus, in this environment the manufacture of ZMapp took up to several months. Production was comparatively inexpensive, since as many as 100 million doses of antibody could be made for $36 million. In addition to Kentucky BioProcessing, the biopharmaceutical companies involved in the development of ZMapp included San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical and Texas-based Caliber Biotherapeutics.",

By chance, Kailahan was the site where ZMapp was stored. The question being debated by the doctors at that time was, should ZMapp be used for humans and, if so, in whom? How would these individuals be selected? It was into this setting that the severely ill Khan's name entered the debate. Initially and under pressure from the Sierra Leone government to do something for Khan, already recognized as a national hero in that country, the physicians treating Khan and others involved were presented with an ethical and philosophical dilemma. What if the patient died as a result of an allergic reaction to ZMapp? ZMapp had not undergone clinical trials for safety and efficacy in humans. What if the treatment failed? Many believed that Khan should receive ZMapp because, in all of West Africa, he was the leading and best known figure involved in the war on Ebola. However, others were hesitant. Also, the fact that Khan was African brought attention to the recent uproar that Westerners were subjecting Africans to lethal therapy. 13 After a heated argument, the authorities in charge decided against giving ZMapp to Khan. That decision would be unpopular and not in line with the general requests for help advocated by Khan's government and specific requests of his colleagues. Garry and Sabeti applied pressure that he should receive the therapy. Khan's blood had already generated antibodies to the virus, indicating that his own immune system was beginning to work to combat the viral infection. However, as discussed above, early reports that the virus could suppress the immune system remained under reassessment, generating concern that the drug might affect his immune response.",

This act created a strongly emotional response from the local population and the international community. Giving ZMapp to two Westerners who survived and not to Khan, an African who died, was highly controversial. Since not all those infected with Ebola die (mortality ranging 50%\u00c070%), possibly the two Westerners would have survived without ZMapp. After all, many did. If Khan had been given ZMapp and died, would Africans be convinced he was used as a guinea pig to be tested with an experimental/unproved therapy without either formal local approval or approval by Western scientific and government committees? The two American recipients of ZMapp, Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, were members of Samaritan's Purse, the Christian Missionary in Liberia. A source from the NIH stated that someone from the CDC contacted Samaritan's Purse and that an NIH scientist later informed them of the drug. However, no one knew if the drug would work or if the ultimate recovery of those taking the ZMapp was due to the drug. After receiving ZMapp, Kent Brantly showed remarkable clinical improvement, although, in contrast, after receiving the drug Nancy Writebol's condition worsened. However, both Brantly and Writebol survived, but may have recovered without the ZMapp-one does not know. The indisputable fact is that Humarr Khan died without receiving ZMapp when, with its therapeutic effect, he might have lived.",

Strangely, since the reported outbreaks of mass Ebola virus infections, some groups of native Africans have expressed doubt that Ebola really exists. Others have voiced allegations that health officials purposely infected the populations to harvest their organs. Hospitals, health care stations, and workers have been attacked and stoned by mobs. Awareness, quarantine, and prohibition of touching people sick or dead from the disease have been viewed by many Africans as myths of Western propaganda. The African custom of touching and washing the body of a dead person prior to burial was being denied and led to resentment, demonstrations, and riots. Further, such public health measures are alien to their culture. Many West Africans believe in cultural superstitions and view Ebola as a curse rather than a pathogen, associating Ebola with witchcraft and sorcery brought there by foreigners. Some locals believe that doctors are killing Ebola patients as a punishment for sexual promiscuity. Fabio Friscia, UNICEF coordinator of the Ebola awareness campaign, explained that what was creating the greatest problem in controlling Ebola was the \"behavior of the population.\" 15 In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone the local population often attacked and disrupted health care workers, forcing them to leave treatment centers and hospitals. In one episode occurring in South-East Guinea, eight members of an Ebola disinfection and awareness team were killed with stones and machetes by fearful villagers. The members killed were part of a relief wing of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.",

A spokesperson for Doctors Without Borders stated \"We understand very well that people are afraid because it is a new disease here, but these are not favorable working conditions so we are suspending our activities.\" 16 Despite such difficult times, the story of ZMapp is not over. As both foreign as well as African health care providers and doctors continued to die from Ebola virus infection, the WHO endorsed the use of ZMapp to combat the uncontrolled outbreak.
