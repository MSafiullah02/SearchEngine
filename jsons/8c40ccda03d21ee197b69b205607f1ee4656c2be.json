All of these diseases cause immunosuppression, which can be compounded by ammonia in the environment. Vaccination or the use of a coccidiostat in the feed or water controls clinical coccidiosis. Turkey coryza is controlled through vaccination and sanitation of the environment and drinking water system. Continuous chlorination of drinking water is widely practiced, but shock chlorination or acid cleaning of the entire water delivery system between flocks can be very important. Hemorrhagic enteritis is controlled through vaccination at 3 to 5 wk of age.

The dust is primarily generated from dry feces and carries high levels of fecal organisms that expose the respiratory system to endotoxins. The dust particles dry to a very light weight, along with some feather and skin dander, and are easily air borne. Farms with tom turkeys experience a marked change in litter conditions after the birds are 12 to 14 wk of age. Typically, the litter goes from being damp or wet and difficult to keep dry, to a very dry condition that is difficult to keep from being dusty. Dusty conditions are particularly evident in colder climates where very dry, cool outside air ventilates the buildings and removes an excessive amount of water. In warm climate areas during summer heat, turkeys experience an excessive intake of dust into their lungs and airsacs due to hyperventilation of moderately dusty air. Both conditions lead to respiratory disease and clinical signs of respiratory distress (gasping). Birds with excessive exudate in their lungs and air sacs usually die, either on the farm or during transport. Survivors will contribute to airsacculitis condemnation and salvage procedures to trim affected air sacs in the processing plant. Sprinkling or fogging with water in turkey houses is a common practice and is used to cool birds in summer and control dust in northern areas in the winter.",

Passage of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA) by congress allows veterinarian to prescribe approved drugs off-label under specified conditions. This has increased the choices and dosages available to treat and reduce disease losses. Additionally, flouroquinolones have been approved for prescription use in turkeys and have been very effective in treating a number of difficult disease problems.",

Septicemia-toxemia is the largest category of whole bird condemnation and airsacculitis is the second largest. However, the Food Safety Inspective Service (FSIS) allows the processing plant to salvage some of the birds with airsacculitis and add the nonsalvaged portion of the carcass to the condemned parts.",

            "text": "The FSIS inspector has three choices for disposition when a bird is presented with airsacculitis. First, the whole bird is condemned if it shows extensive airsacculitis to the extent that the carcass can not be inspected adequately or shows signs of septicemia-toxemia. Secondly, the carcass can be passed for vacuum cleanout on-line if the inspector feels that the plant will adequately remove the kidneys, all the exudate, and affected airsacs and the bird is otherwise wholesome. Third, if the carcass has interclavicular airsacculitis or if the inspector does not feel the plant will do an adequate job of on-line cleanout and the carcass is otherwise wholesome, the bird can be sent off-line to be knifesalvaged instead of whole-bird condemned. The knife salvage procedure allows salvage of approximately 55% of the carcass and the rest of the carcass is put into the condemned parts. The latter category is very high in some operations. In general, the poundage of condemned parts has been increasing each year, and has become greater than the pounds of whole bird condemned. A greater emphasis has been placed on the control of airsacculitis in live production to prevent these losses.",

            "text": "Ventilation is essential in preventing and controlling disease in turkeys. Ventilation equipment and management of ventilation varies widely in the industry. A tour of operations will reveal a dozen different types of ventilation systems and ventilation management and control systems. Sidewall curtains are the standard in most parts of the country for grower-finisher buildings and are used to brood poults in warmer climates. Buildings with solid walls are standard in brooder buildings and are used in northern colder climates for grower-finisher buildings as well. Combinations of building are also used. There are four fairly distinct basic systems. The most common system is \"natural ventilation\", which refers to a nonpowered system that depends primarily on wind and convection. The most common configuration is a curtain-sided building with sliding end doors that is oriented east-west to catch the southerly winds in summer and solar heat in the winter. The building usually has stir fans to equalize temperatures, improve litter drying, and cool birds in summer. Slow speed, ceiling-mounted fans are used in some operations. However, the most common stir fans are vertically mounted in the center of the building blowing horizontally all in one direction, so that air moves from one fan to the other. The air is pushed from one end of the building to the other and a portion of the air moves back down the sidewalls creating a circular, end-to-end pattern. This results in good mixing and good air movement over the litter. Horizontal stir fans may also be mounted on the side walls or support poles. Fans are usually controlled by timer and by thermostat. Automatic curtain minders are standard to control temperature. Sophisticated computer controlled systems are available and utilized in some operations. Ridge openings with manual or computer control systems are used in some operations in cooler parts of the country. Ridge ventilation depends primarily on the power of convection.",

            "text": "The second type of ventilation system and generally the standard in the industry for solid wall buildings, is \"negative pressure ventilation\". This system utilizes exhaust fans to exchange air in the building. Control of the fans and intake openings varies from manual control using thermostats or times or stage operators on the fans, to fully computerized controllers. Static pressure control is important for mixing of the air. Tunnel ventilation, which is used in broilers, is an extreme application of negative pressure. It is used with foggers in hot climate areas and variations of the system are used in turkey breeders; tunnel ventilation is not used much for market birds.",
