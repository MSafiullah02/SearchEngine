T cells respond to foreign peptide antigens (T-cell epitopes) bound the cell surface expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [1\u20134]. There are two main classes of MHC molecules, MHC class I (MHCI) and MHC class II (MHCII) that are in turn recognized by CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells, respectively [4]. In humans, MHC molecules are known as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs) and are extremely polymorphic [5]. HLA polymorphisms are the basis for distinct peptide binding specificity of HLA allelic variants [5].",

In computational cross-validations, RANKPEP profiles exhibited a great performance [17]. However, they are not necessarily the best for all predictive matters. In fact there is no general consensus on what peptides should be included for peptide\u2013MHC binding model building.

EPIMHC data is structured as a relational database with a set of related tables (Fig. 1). Entries in EPIMHC are unique with regard to the combination of two features: the sequence of the peptide and the MHC restriction element. Main annotations in EPIMHC include information on the ligand (sequence, length, MHC binding, T-cell activity, processing, protein source, protein name, and organisms), the MHC restriction element (CLASS, MHC molecule and MHC source), and publication reference. The \u201cprocessing\u201d field indicates whether the peptides are processed and presented from their protein sources in vivo (annotated as natural). \u201cMHC binding\u201d and \u201cimmunogenicity level\u201d fields follow a qualitative annotation of four values (high, moderate, little, unknown). The immunogenicity level only applies to peptides with reported \u201cT-cell activity.\u201d Immunogenicity and MHC-binding binding levels were obtained from the literature and translated onto the indicated qualitative values as previously reported [26].

            "text": "As mentioned, motif-profiles consist of weighted PSSM [25] created from a set of aligned peptide sequences known to bind to a given MHC molecule. In order to predict peptide\u2013MHC binding and T-cell epitope using motif-profiles, we used a search algorithm known as RANKPEP [17, 18]. The algorithm uses the profile coefficients to score all possible peptide fragments in a protein with the width of the PSSM and ranks them by score. The width of a PSSM is given by the number of residue sites in a multiple sequence alignment. Although rank per se is insufficient to assess whether a peptide is a potential binder, we have shown that T-cell epitopes score among the top 2 % ranking peptides [17, 18]. Motif-profiles assume that peptide residues contribute independently to MHC binding. This assumption is well supported by experimental data, although there are reported instances in which the contribution of peptide residues to MHC-binding is influenced by neighboring residues [28].",

Under SET DISPLAY OPTIONS, users can select between two options to set the number of peptides to be returned by the algorithm: one is as a fixed number of top scoring peptides and the other as a percentage of top scoring peptides. Users can also restrict the peptides sorted by RANKPEP by molecular weight (MW) so that only peptides within a MW window will be returned. By default, MW filtering is not applied. The RANKPEP interface also provides three models for proteasomal cleavage predictions [17, 22]. By default, model one is selected. These models will be applied regardless of the class of the MHC targeted for predictions but the predictions are only meaningful for MHC I-restricted peptides (see\nNote\n4).\n\n",

However, rank per se is insufficient to know whether a given peptide will bind to a particular MHC molecule, e.g., scoring a single peptide. Therefore, EPIMHC provides a profile-specific BT that serves to identify the most confident peptide\u2013MHC binders and T-cell epitopes as those with a score \u2265 BT. The profile-specific BT provided by EPIMC is obtained by scoring all the peptides used to make the relevant profile matching the 90 percentile value of all peptide scores [18]. The next part in the RANKPEP output consists of a list of peptides from the input protein ranked by the scores obtained with the relevant profile. In our case, RANKPEP shows only 9 peptides from SARS nucleoprotein because we selected to display only the 2 % of top scoring peptides. For every peptide, RANKPEP shows its rank (RANK), location in the protein sequence (POS), sequence (SEQUENCE), three N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) flaking residues, score (SCORE), and relative score, in percentage, with regard to the optimum score (%OPT).

To demonstrate such influence, here we will compare the predictions of A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from SARS nucleoprotein that are obtained with 4 distinct motif-profiles, including that described in the previous section (hereafter profile #1). The specific peptide selections that give rise to the different profiles used in this section are detailed in Table 2. Briefly, all profile-motifs are generated from peptides binding with high affinity to A*0201. In addition, profile #3 and #4 only include peptides from viruses and profile #2 and #4 only include peptides known to display T-cell activity (they are epitopes). To evaluate the predictive performance of these profiles, we scored and ranked all peptides from SARS nucleoprotein and compared the ranking achieved by the known SARS nucleoprotein A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes shown in Table 1. These results are summarized in Table 3. All four motif-profiles produce related results, ranking the known CD8 T-cell epitopes among the top scoring peptides of SARS nucleoprotein. This is expected as A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes and the peptides used for model building have in common the ability to bind to A*0201. However, there are also differences in the results. Thus, only the profiles derived from viral peptides are capable of predicting the known A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from SARS nucleoprotein among the top 11 scoring peptides (Table 3). Judging from the dispersion of the ranks (Table 3), the best overall epitope predictions are obtained with a motif-profile derived from viral peptides with known T-cell activity (T-cell epitopes). It remains to be explored whether discarding peptide\u2013MHC binders with no reported T-cell activity always improves the resulting T-cell epitope prediction models. It is important to note that none of the known epitopes used in these analyses have been used to derive any of the profiles. In fact, the current version of EPIMHC does not contain any SARS peptides at all.\n",

Moreover, profiles can only be generated from peptides with the same length; otherwise EPIMHC returns an error (see Subheading 3.1). There are practical and structure-based reasons for this limitation as discussed by Reche et al. [18].EPIMHC can also produce profiles from peptides that have been selected to bind to MHC II molecules, provided that they have the same length (see Subheading 3.1). However, as data availability is limited, we recommend using a motif discovery program such as MEME [31] for making peptide\u2013MHC II binding profiles from peptides of any length as described in previous reports [17, 18].The proteasomal cleavage predictions should not be taken in consideration when predicting peptide binding to MHC II molecules: the proteasome is not involved in class II antigen processing. We are working in correcting this inconsistency.For RANKPEP to return all peptides in a given protein sorted by score, users need to make the following selections in the RANKPEP input form: first set peptides to display by number and then select 990 from the pull-down menu.To generate profiles that are capable of capturing the relevant peptide\u2013MHC binding feature, we suggest using a minimum of five peptides.\n",
