            "text": "Since their discovery in 1957 as mediators of the phenomenon of viral interference (i.e., inhibition of growth of one virus by another), interferons (IFNs) have become recognized as potent cytokines that are associated with complex antiviral, immunomodulating, and antiproliferative actions.1, 2, 3 IFNs are proteins that are synthesized by eukaryotic cells in response to various inducers and that cause biochemical changes leading to a nonselective antiviral state in exposed cells of the same species. Three subfamilies of IFNs are recognized. Type I IFNs are the largest subfamily and include the IFN-\u03b1s (13 subtypes in humans) and the IFN-\u03b2s. The type II subfamily has only one member, IFN-\u03b3. Type III is the subfamily most recently identified and includes IFN-\u03bb,4 of which there are three subtypes (\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3), also known as interleukin (IL)-28, IL-29, and IL-28R.5, 6 A fourth interferon \u03bb subtype (\u03bb4) has been recently identified.6a The type I IFNs are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 9 in humans,7 Type II IFN is on chromosome 12, and type III IFNs are encoded on chromosome 19.8 Formerly designated on the basis of the cell types from which they were derived, the IFN-\u03b1s, the IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 are the IFNs currently in clinical use (Table 47-1\n), whereas IFN-\u03bb is being studied for hepatitis C. Each type is immunologically distinct and has different producer cells, inducers, and biologic effects and unique physicochemical characteristics.2, 4, 9\n",

IFN-\u03b3 production is restricted to T lymphocytes and natural killer cells responding to antigenic stimuli, mitogens, and certain cytokines, such as IL-2. The IFN-\u03bbs also appear to be produced by multiple cell types.10 The principal antiviral IFNs, IFN-\u03b1s and IFN-\u03b2s, are approximately 30% homologous at the amino-acid level. The human IFN-\u03b1s share a high degree of amino-acid sequence homology (>70%) but have differing in vitro antiviral and biologic effects on human cells.11 Compared with the IFN-\u03b1s and IFN-\u03b2s, IFN-\u03b3 has less antiviral activity but more potent immunoregulatory effects, particularly with respect to macrophage activation, expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, and mediation of local inflammatory responses. Most IFNs in clinical use are produced by recombinant DNA techniques (see Table 47-1).",

For the type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1s and IFN-\u03b2) the cognate receptor is IFNAR1/2. Type II IFNs (IFN-\u03b3) use the homodimeric receptors, IFNGR1/2. Type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb) signal through a receptor complex consisting of IL10R2 and IFNLR1.6, 14 IFN receptors are linked to the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathways, which, through a multistep process, activate transcription factors that bind selectively to and upregulate approximately 100 IFN-regulated genes.15, 16, 17 The distinct pattern of STAT proteins activated by different IFNs is one mechanism for eliciting different cellular responses. For IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, a three-protein complex known as IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3) localizes to the nucleus and binds to a cis-acting DNA element (designated IRSE) that activates transcription of the target genes.1\n",

Activated PKR selectively phosphorylates and inactivates eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 to impede translation.

The initial plasma  averages 2 to 3 hours, but there is a prolonged terminal  of approximately 180 hours.97 Single oral doses of 5 mg/kg in children provide maximal plasma concentrations of 1.3 \u00b5g/mL and approximately 40% lower overall drug exposure because of a larger volume of distribution and more rapid clearance. Neonates seem to require higher dosages in part because of lower bioavailability.98\n",

Pleconaril induces CYP3A isoenzymes, however, and consequently has the potential for multiple drug interactions, including with oral contraceptives.99 In children or adults with enteroviral meningitis, pleconaril has inconsistent effects on headache and illness duration.97 Pleconaril (400 mg three times a day for 5 days) reduces the duration of uncomplicated rhinovirus colds by about 1 day99, 100 but was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Pleconaril antiviral effects and clinical outcomes are related to in vitro susceptibility.100 Pleconaril treatment (15 mg/kg/day [children] and 600 to 1200 mg/day [adults] in divided doses for 7 to 10 days) seems to be beneficial in some patients with severe or life-threatening enteroviral syndromes, including chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in agammaglobulinemic patients and possibly neonatal enteroviral sepsis.97, 101, 102 The drug was formerly available for compassionate use, but it is no longer so.",
