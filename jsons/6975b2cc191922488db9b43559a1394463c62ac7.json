We piloted measurement of PC-ESLD QIs in all patients confirmed to have ESLD using a chart abstraction tool. Results Out of 167 patients identified using at least one sampling strategy, 62 were confirmed to meet ESLD criteria with chart abstraction. Ninety-eight percent of veterans in the cohort were male, mean age at diagnosis was 61 years, and 74% were White. The overall QI pass rate was 68% (64% for information care planning QIs and 76% for supportive care QIs). Patients receiving specialty palliative care consultation were more likely to receive information care planning QIs (67% vs. 37%, p = 0.02). The best performing sampling strategy had a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 60%.",

For example, there were 38,170 reported deaths from ESLD in the USA in 2014, while only 7237 liver transplants were performed for all forms of liver disease [3, 4] . The supportive needs of patients with ESLD are also high. Their symptom burden is comparable to patients with advanced lung and colon cancer in the last 6 months prior to death, and Medicare beneficiaries with cirrhosis also report greater functional disability and use of healthcare utilization compared to age-matched controls and patients with heart failure [5, 6] .",

In a national study examining in-hospital deaths of patients with ESLD from 2009 to 2013, use of invasive life-sustaining treatments was high with 56% percent of patients receiving mechanical ventilation, 16% receiving hemodialysis, and 6% receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Nineteen quality indicators (QIs) for palliative care in ESLD were recently selected using the RAND/ UCLA appropriateness method (RAM) [13] . Our study's primary aim was to pilot the use of these QIs to measure the quality of palliative care delivered to veterans with ESLD. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System is the largest provider of care for patients with hepatitis C, and given the rising incidence of ESLD in this population, optimizing palliative care in this population is particularly crucial [14] [15] [16] .

Our study found that the receipt of supportive care QIs (76%) was higher than information care planning QIs (64%). A similar discrepancy in receipt of QIs by domain was observed in a study investigating quality of end-of-life care in patients with various serious chronic illnesses hospitalized at a major quaternary academic medical center [21] . In our cohort, only about half of patients were offered ACP, whether they were being considered or not considered for liver transplant. Furthermore, ACP was only offered to 58% of patients with newly diagnosed hepatic encephalopathy, which increases the risk of a patient lacking capacity to make their own decisions. Information care planning practices were even less frequently adopted once patients become hospitalized. Goals of care discussions were documented less than one-third of time and not at all for patients surviving 48 h after ICU admission and after mechanical ventilation, respectively.",

In patients who are being evaluated for liver transplant, concurrent specialty palliative care consultation was associated with improvement in symptom burden and depression symptoms after 6 months of follow-up [24] . This study further adds to these findings that specialty palliative care services may provide benefits for patients with ESLD. In addition, our study suggests that referral rates to specialty palliative care in ESLD may be lower than those for veterans with advanced cancer, highlighting potential room for improvement [25] . Supportive care QIs were more frequently met, likely owing to the fact that avoidance of high doses of acetaminophen and provision of paracentesis for ascites are wellestablished practices in the management of all patients with ESLD [26] . The avoidance of NSAIDs, however, was not followed 39% of the time, which may reflect the tension that providers face when only limited options are present to alleviate pain in patients with ESLD, who are at higher risk of adverse events from available pain relief strategies, such as narcotics [27] . Patients with a history of homelessness and history of drug and alcohol abuse were more likely to receive supportive QIs. This runs counter to previous studies that have shown more challenges in access and provision of palliative care in these patient populations but may reflect the high commitment to providing these services in the veteran Health Administration [28] [29] [30] .",

Future work should explore natural language processing and machine learning as potential methods to improve identification of a denominator with higher sensitivity and specificity. The perspectives of veterans with ESLD and caregivers on receipt of palliative care and hospice services should also be collected to help guide future quality improvement work in this field. Our findings demonstrate that it is feasible to measure the quality of palliative care for a veteran cohort of patients with ESLD with good reliability. Our identification of a seriously ill group of patients with ESLD using a combination of ICD-9 codes can be used for future cohort studies in the VA system that are looking to investigate their clinical care and outcomes. Our preliminary findings from this study highlight the need for better information care planning in patients with ESLD, particularly as patients' care becomes more acute, and suggest some benefit in involving specialty palliative care services in improving this goal. We believe our methods for measuring quality of palliative care can be applied to the national veteran population, which can further add to our knowledge of ways to better improve the care of this vulnerable group.",
