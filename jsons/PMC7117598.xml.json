The CYP2C8 gene spans approximately 30 kb, including nine exons (Figure 1)\n[11]. This open reading frame codes for a 490 amino acid protein, which quantitatively represents approximately 7% of the total liver CYP enzymes and approximately 30% of the hepatic CYP2C subfamily content. Among the major members of the CYP2C subfamily (2C8, 2C9 and 2C19), CYP2C8 is the most divergent in terms of protein sequence: while CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 share over 90% of homology, CYP2C8 is only 75% similar to each one of these enzymes. Notably, the CYP2C8 active site has recently been shown to be significantly different from the other members, in size (1438 \u00c53) and shape [12]. The volume of the active pocket allows the accommodation of relatively large molecules, probably contributing for the differences in ranges of substrates as compared with 2C9 and 2C19 [13].",

These are released in the blood stream, where they promptly invade red blood cells, initiating the intraerythrocytic cycle. Asexual multiplication progresses in this cycle, with invading merozoites growing into trophozoites that will mature towards multinuclear intraerythrocytic schizonts. Each of these will provide 8\u201324 new merozoites, which are released at the burst of the erythrocytes. These will attack new red blood cells, re-initiating the typical (P. falciparum, and P. vivax) 48 hour intraerythrocyte cycle. During this process some merozoites will develop into gametocytes, sexual forms that, if ingested by the mosquito during the blood meal, will progress into fertilization and production of new sporozoites, ready for re-invading the human host and completing the overall cycle.

The situation in high transmission zones is different \u2013 a cured patient can be re-infected in just some days, at a point when the plasma concentrations of the long half-life partner drug are at subtherapeutic levels.

After an intravenous 4-h infusion of 10 mg base/kg to ten adult patients with P. falciparum malaria, the half-life of the first disposition phase was 22 min (geometric mean; range 5\u2013126 min) and the half-life of the terminal phase 10 h (geometric mean; range 3\u201333 h). Clearance was 6 l/h/kg (range 2\u201317) [22]. After an intravenous injection of 3 mg base/kg to six healthy volunteers, similar characteristics were observed but clearance was higher (geometric mean 13 l/h/kg; range 5\u201356) and the terminal half-life shorter (geometric mean 2 h, range 0.5\u20136 h) than in patients. These differences in observed clearance may be due to a reduced hepatic blood-flow or reduced enzyme activity in acute malaria. It is possible that there is another disposition phase of AQ with a longer half-life. This is indicated by the detection of AQ in urine for longer time than expected by Winstanley and colleagues [26]. The authors only present long-term urinary data for one subject, but in this subject 0.5 \u00b5g/ml AQ was observed 5 months after a 600 mg oral single dose.",

During the metabolism of hemoglobin the toxic heme is liberated from its molecular scaffold. CQ (and possibly AQ or DEAQ) binds heme, disturbing its inactivation by the parasite [40]. Pfcrt SNPs, in particular a K76T variation, render the parasite resistant to the drug, probably through the efflux of CQ from the organelle. CQ-resistance is reversible in vitro by the action of the calcium blocker verapamil (VP), known to interfere specifically with K76T harboring PfCRT proteins. Interestingly, although DEAQ sensitivity is reversible with VP, AQ response is not significantly affected [41]. This data points for pfcrt K76T to be associated mainly with DEAQ response, partially explaining previously observed in vivo CQ/AQ cross-resistance in vivo, which should maybe be better interpreted as CQ/DEAQ. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned \u2018tail effect\u2019, the slowly eliminated DEAQ is predicted to be the weak link promoting resistance in the AQ\u2013ART combination.",

Results in vitro show that AQ is able to significantly enhance the action of its metabolite towards extraordinary low AQ:DEAQ ratios, beyond 1:100,000.

Although the authors did not test the induction potency of artesunate, neither the induction of CYP2C8, the possibility remains that when used in ACT, AQ might be metabolized at a higher rate during ACT due to artesunate-based activation of PXR and/or CAR [61]. Furthermore, it is also possible that other commonly co-administered PXR activators, such as the antituberculosis agent rifampicin and some of the HIV drugs, may further induce the CYP2C8 expression. Such interactions are likely to reduce AQ exposure. In this scenario, the relative positive impact of low-metabolizer status in the efficacy of AQ might still be present, as a less active enzyme will be induced as compared with an induced fast-metabolizer.",
