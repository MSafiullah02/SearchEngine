Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a subset of HLH often associated with rheumatologic diseases. Unlike sHLH, which occurs with malignancy and infection, MAS may occur with systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), adult\u2010onset Still disease (AOSD), and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) (7). MAS associated with underlying rheumatic conditions can be triggered by infections, such as Epstein\u2010Barr virus and varicella zoster virus, in up to one\u2010third of patients (8).",

In such patients, evaluation is usually directed at infection and malignancy. However, consideration of MAS and prompt evaluation for abnormalities associated with MAS should always be undertaken, particularly in patients who are atypical or who do not respond quickly to therapy. For example, markedly elevated transaminase, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels will suggest a diagnosis of MAS. The ferritin level is nearly always elevated to a significant degree, with a median value of 9094 ng/ml (4). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is typically low (4). The diagnosis of MAS is often delayed because of the lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria specific to this disease (12). In addition, the lack of a true guideline\u2010directed therapy for MAS results in high mortality (6). As such, early diagnosis and rapid initiation of therapies aimed at reducing systemic inflammation is critical to the management of MAS.",

In particularly resistant cases, the HLH\u20102004 protocol may be followed (14). However, it should be noted that the HLH\u20102004 protocol is built on the initial work of the HLH\u201094 study, which specifically sought to exclude cases of HLH secondary to malignancy or rheumatologic processes. This protocol uses high\u2010dose glucocorticoids as well as both systemic (etoposide and/or cyclosporine) and intrathecal (if central nervous system involvement) therapies with a goal ultimately of hematopoietic stem cell transplant to cure familial cases in pediatric patients (15, 16). Clinicians often find, however, that these therapeutic options are not adequate, and mortality in adult secondary HLH has been reported to be as high as 66% to 74% (17, 18).",

Anakinra, a recombinant IL\u20101 receptor antagonist, is currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal\u2010onset multisystem inflammatory disease. Despite its FDA designation, anakinra is used off label to treat a variety of autoinflammatory diseases. Although limited, there are now case reports and series showing both sIJA\u2010related MAS (19, 20, 21, 22) and other HLH secondary subtypes (22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27) responding favorably to anakinra. As such, it appears that anakinra may be viewed as an emerging and effective therapy in the treatment of MAS. The current literature regarding anakinra use in MAS, particularly as it pertains to adult cases, is limited, and further information regarding its effectiveness and potential clinical benefits and risks is needed. As such, we present a case series of our experience using an approach of continuously infused intravenous (IV) anakinra for refractory MAS in a level 1 tertiary care academic center over a 3\u2010year period.",

However, there are no accepted guidelines for the treatment of adult HLH with anakinra. Although the HLH\u20102004 induction protocol can be used, patients with MAS often do not respond (34). As occasionally reported in treatment studies of pediatric patients with sJIA, anakinra may be used (35). Recent work by Eloseily et al (22) supports the use of anakinra in treating pediatric patients with non\u2013malignancy\u2010associated secondary HLH, particularly when given early in the disease course and when administered to patients who have underlying rheumatic disease. Treatment with anakinra was associated with improved overall survival in comparison with patients who received etoposide\u2010based protocols. Earlier treatment with anakinra, in the first 5 days of hospitalization, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality. Although promising, there is some hesitation about broad application of IL\u20101 blockade in cases of secondary HLH not due to underlying autoimmune disease (36) because secondary HLH remains a very heterogenous disease. As further divisions in clinical, serologic, and genetic profiles of patients with secondary HLH are established, targeted therapy algorithms for different phenotypes may be established.",

Prior to starting anakinra, the five patients in this study received a variety of immunomodulators during the course of their disease, including methylprednisolone(n = 5), tocilizumab (n = 1), IVIG (n = 1), cyclophosphamide (n = 1), and cyclosporine (n = 3). Despite these medications, the disease progressed. Given the poor prognosis and high mortality, all five patients were started on rapidly escalating anakinra dosing up to 2400 mg of continuous infusion daily, or the equivalent in cases of renal failure, to achieve autoinflammatory cytokine storm inhibition. The dose required was usually the equivalent of 1 to 2 mg/kg/h, similar to doses used in sepsis trials (38). Clinically, as well as by laboratory studies including ferritin, cell counts, liver function tests, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, and triglycerides, four of five patients had a remarkable response. One patient did not respond.",

They are also reminded to build the compound to give a rate of no less than 5 ml/h. Concentration should be from 1 to 5 mg/ml. In addition, anakinra is light sensitive. Pharmacy instructions must include the following statement: \u201cThis product needs to be protected from light, including both the final container bag and the tubing.\u201d The infusion bag is sent in an amber bag and nurses use 2 to 3 feet of covering for the tubing.

Cytopenias and renal injury occurred in five of five and three of five patients, respectively. It is unclear whether this was due to the known clinical course of MAS or due to high\u2010dose anakinra. However, in one patient, the cytopenias developed after other laboratory values were improving and persisted while anakinra was continued, even as the dose was being lowered. When the dose was reduced to 100 mg daily, all hematologic abnormalities returned to normal. Three of five patients developed gram\u2010negative bacteremia during their clinical course. Cytokine storm was successfully inhibited with anakinra in four of five patients. One patient never achieved control, with a rising ferritin level of 523 213 ng/ml on the day of death due to sepsis. One patient improved serologically and clinically but later died of sepsis.",

Gram\u2010negative bacteremia might be associated with the length of time patients were on higher doses of anakinra because, in our experience, shorter courses in other patients and/or other diseases treated did not manifest similar problems. One might, however, consider prophylactic antibiotics if prolonged therapy will be necessary. As we gained experience with this modality, we were able to decrease the anakinra dose more quickly.",

A subgroup of patients with COVID\u201019 with severe disease may have a cytokine storm syndrome (39), and treatment with agents used for cytokine storm may be indicated. As discussed eloquently in a recent editorial, personalized approaches to the patients with MAS and other secondary HLH syndromes are necessary. Current data do not support a carte blanche approach to hyperinflammatory syndromes using anakinra. (36). Interestingly, however, a reanalysis of data from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial of IL\u20101 blockade (anakinra) in sepsis showed significant survival benefit in patients with hyperinflammation, without increased adverse events. (38, 39). Currently, tocilizumab is being studied as a possible therapy. The rapid serological response, followed by clinical response, in the patients described herein was striking enough to suggest that continuous IV anakinra infusions might also be considered for cytokine storm in COVID\u201019 infection.",
