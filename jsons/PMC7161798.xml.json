The genome is initially translated into a single polyprotein with \u22483400 amino acids, which is subsequently proteolytically processed into ten viral proteins.2 DENV alone accounts for nearly 400 million infections3 and 500 000 hospitalizations per year worldwide.4 It is expected that factors such as global warming and urbanization will promote flaviviral infections in a manner outpacing population growth, largely due to enhanced opportunities for the proliferation of the most common flavivirus vectors, mosquitos, and ticks.5, 6 Much work is still needed to gain a comprehensive view of the flavivirus life cycle in order to develop effective treatments against these infections. In this review, we focus primarily on the flavivirus genus, although we do not hesitate to fill knowledge gaps with work involving the broader Flaviviridae family, which includes the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV), as well as work from other genera such as Picornaviridae.",

The encapsidated RNA genome exists solely as a positive single strand.7 Upon internalization, fusion of the virus membrane with the host endosomal membrane allows the release of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. This RNA serves as the template for translation by the host ribosome at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to produce the viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) possessing RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. The combination of viral nonstructural (NS) proteins that interact to amplify viral RNA (vRNA) is known as the \u201creplicase\u201d complex, which is localized in membranous vesicles derived from the ER.8 The negative strand is then synthesized by NS5 and is found only in association with the positive strand. This double\u2010stranded form of vRNA (dsRNA) serves as a template for the production of an excess of positive\u2010strand RNA, which may be utilized for further translation, generation of another round of negative strands, or packaged into the maturing virion. vRNA is thus found in dsRNA and (+) single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA) forms, as well as a more heterogeneous form associated with (+) ssRNA strands emerging from dsRNA.",

Presumably, the structure serves primarily to stall the ribosome over the start codon, as the cHP's sequence is variable but its stability and location with respect to the start codon clearly correlate with initiation efficiency. It should also be noted that, while lacking a poly(A) tail, the flaviviral 3\u2032\u2010UTR has been shown to interact with poly(A)\u2010binding protein (PABP), another hallmark of cap\u2010dependent translation.10\n",

This is because no such structures are evident in flaviviral RNA. Also, the addition of a stable 5\u2032\u2010terminal structure inhibited noncanonical translation, suggesting that ribosome binding does not bypass recognition of the vRNA terminus.11 Nevertheless, we note a similarity between the hepacivirus IRES and the flavivirus 3\u2032\u2010UTR: they are of similar length (350 nt and 450 nt, respectively) and contain specific structures that block degradation by the host exonuclease XRN1.12, 13 In addition, numerous studies have shown that a variety of alterations to flaviviral 3\u2032\u2010UTRs affect translational output14, 15 and that these UTRs bind to host factors involved in translation (e.g., PABP10 and elongation factor 1\u2010\u03b116). Conversely, the HCV 3\u2032\u2010UTR and flaviviral 5\u2032\u2010UTR are short relative to their opposing UTRs, and both contain poly(U) sequences of unknown function. One may wonder whether a distant evolutionary event flipped the UTRs that flanked the coding region of the hepacivirus and the flavivirus ancestor. The flaviviral 3\u2032\u2010UTR, however, does not appear to directly interact with ribosome, given an absence of RNA reads in the 3\u2032\u2010UTR in a ribosomal profiling study.17 This work also showed that the viral translation process is quite inefficient in comparison to that of host messenger RNA (mRNA): the authors speculate that such \u201clazy\u201d translation may reduce the chances of alterations in ER homeostasis that would trigger host defense mechanisms.17\n",

Electron microscopy revealed such behavior in alphavirus in the 1970s.18 In a mid\u20101980s flurry of virus sequence analysis studies, Hahn et al.19 showed that a number of flaviviruses contained conserved 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010complementary sequences (CS) that could potentially facilitate cyclization. Padmanabhan's group then showed that mutations in these CS regions impaired (\u2013) strand synthesis, while restoring complementarity with a second set of mutations rescued replication.20 Gamarnik and colleagues later used atomic force microscopy to visualize cyclization of an approximation of DENV RNA.21 This work, however, was not without its critics; Lott and Doran22 decried an experimental setup that seemed to be designed to produce the expected cyclization result and pointed out the difficulty of distinguishing cyclization (in cis interactions) from concatemerization (in trans). Be that as it may, a long, diverse compendium of experiments apparently support flaviviral genome cyclization.23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 We note that \u201ccyclization\u201d of the replicating form of vRNA does not necessarily mean that the translated form of vRNA is \u201clinear.\u201d Indeed, it is established that translating host poly(A)\u2010tailed mRNAs take a circular form, with PABP and eIF4s bridging the two termini.35 It is even possible that vRNA can assume more than one cyclized form. For simplicity, we will continue to use the term \u201ccyclization\u201d as opposed to \u201c5\u2032\u20133\u2032 complementarity,\u201d but the above caveats should not be ignored.",

In 2006, Filomatori et al.21 combined a number of RNA fragments from DENV UTRs with the purified recombinant RdRp subunit of NS5 in the context of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Surprisingly, RdRp was found to interact with a 160 nt (+) 5\u2032\u2010terminal input, but not with a 3\u2032 input. In vitro polymerase assays yielded parallel results; a combination of RdRp and the (+) 3\u2032\u2010UTR failed to generate (\u2013) complementary products, but a (+) 5\u2032 template did. If both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 inputs were present with RdRp, both (\u2013) CS were generated as previously noted in a similar experiment.20 These observations gave rise to the notion that the 5\u2032\u2010terminus acts as the promoter for (\u2013) vRNA synthesis and cyclization places 5\u2032\u2010bound NS5 in proximity to the (+) 3\u2032\u2010terminus.

In fact, the consensus CACAG sequence in the SL top loop (hereafter designated SL\u2010TL) has been recognized as particularly conserved among flaviviruses for more than 30 years:41 a study from 2005 shows that a variety of point mutations in SL\u2010TL completely disable replication, but not translation.42 In contrast to previous studies conducted by Gamarnik and colleagues, our EMSA confirmed the affinity of RdRp with 3\u2032 SL and a sensitive in vitro alpha binding assay provided an apparent K\nd of \u22483 nm for the interaction between RdRp and SL\u2010TL.40 It should be noted that two recent studies in which affinities of DENV RdRp with a 5\u2032\u2010UTR fragment containing SLA were measured in solution yielded K\nd values ranging from 53 nm to 142 nm.43, 44\n",

Since a critical sequence for cyclization, the 3\u2032\u2010UAR, overlaps with the basal 5\u2032 region of the SL stem, a base\u2010pairing interaction with the 5\u2032\u2010UAR in SLB results in SL stem shortening, leaving the viral 3\u2032\u2010terminal region free from the stem. Clues to a role played by structural rearrangement of the 3\u2032\u2010end of vRNA are found in earlier in vitro RdRp assays, where minor alterations to the 3\u2032\u2010terminus produced large changes in assay output.38, 48 Also, Gamarnik's group performed a DENV RdRp assay with RNA templates that simply joined SLA to two variants of SL: in one, the 3\u2032\u2010terminus was predicted to be engaged in a stem, but in the other, the terminus was expected to be unpaired.39 Though 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 interactions would not be expected with these constructs, only the construct with the unpaired terminus generated the full\u2010length product. Therefore, cyclization of the UTRs per se does not enable replication; rather, a free 3\u2032\u2010terminus is critical. A summary of RdRp activity assays against various RNA inputs is provided in Table 1; note the obvious dependence of polymerase activity on the structure of the 3\u2032\u2010terminus.",

It seems reasonable that NS5 could stimulate cyclization by disrupting SLB upon binding to SLA\u2010TL, exposing the 5\u2032\u2010UAR. At the other end of the genome, cyclization triggers exposure of the 3\u2032\u2010terminus, providing access to RdRp and initiates (\u2013) vRNA synthesis.40 We propose that the dual NS5\u2010binding sites, SLA and SL, may act as sensors of NS5 concentration and that cyclization occurs only when sufficient quantities of NS5 have been translated.

These pairings are not commonly seen in flaviviruses with no known vector, making it clear that such duplication almost certainly relates to host\u2010switching.54, 55 With regard to the dumbbell pair, deletion of the DENV A2 sequence significantly reduced replication in mosquito cells, while the opposite effect was observed upon A3 deletion.54 When the experiment was performed in human cells, the trends held but were far less dramatic. This work also showed an accumulation of mutations within the A3 region upon multiple passages in mosquito C6/36 cells. These results were considered to suggest that one structure would be free to mutate to adapt to the host environment, while the other essential structure would remain constant. Relevance to cyclization was further implied as a mutation that eliminated a pseudoknot\u2010forming sequence within the A3 dumbbell, which interacts with the 3\u2032 CS involved in 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 pairing, significantly increased viral replication in mosquito cells. Here, we would suggest that research might be furthered by a decreased focus on cyclization and increased focus on the possible protein factors that interact with the dumbbell structures. Sequestration of any host factor that has a strong influence on the immune response could be seen as the primary event and an alteration in cyclization being considered a secondary effect. It is possible that one duplicated structure binds mosquito factors, while the other binds the orthologous human factors.

Later experiments involving JEV,62 SLEV,63 Kunjin,64 and WNV7 did not violate these patterns. Over the course of this work, it was found that radiolabeled nucleotide was rapidly incorporated into isolated dsRNA during replication, suggesting that the newest strands actually displaced somewhat older strands, in contrast to a model where dsRNA was only locally unwound. BVDV (Flaviviridae) was also shown to follow the above sequence of events, and RNase A resistance experiments suggested more than one nascent strand per RI.65 Another feature of flaviviral RNA was that, unlike alphaviruses, no distinct subgenomic RNAs capable of serving as viral mRNA could be detected in cells infected with flaviviruses\u2014an observation that was important in necessitating the family division of Flaviviridae from Togaviridae.66\n",

It seems rational to expect that initial replication would not occur at the same time and location as translation, as the vRNA would be translated in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, while negative\u2010strand growth would proceed in the opposite direction. Nevertheless, it could be questioned whether, probabilistically, such a ribosome\u2013polymerase collision would be a practical concern. A number of lines of evidence suggested that viruses indeed have switching mechanisms that would minimize this conflict. Gamarnik's80 work with poliovirus replicons showed a near\u2010absence of vRNA synthesis in vitro shortly after the addition of the HeLa lysate; however, RNA synthesis could be induced via the simple addition of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translation. 3CD, the poliovirus polymerase, which was previously shown to interact with a 5\u2032 cloverleaf structure, was required for this switch to replication.81 Such a result makes sense as replication only proceeds when its components reach a critical concentration. Removal of the cloverleaf RNA structure dramatically reduced translation and, perhaps more interestingly, replication, even in the presence of adequate levels of 3CD. Moving to the flavivirus, Lo et al.,28 using WNV, and the laboratories of Gamarnik21 and Padmanabhan,82 using DENV, later showed via a replicon luciferase signal that an initial increase in translated products was followed by a decline. A new wave of translation was observed again \u224824 h after the introduction of the replicon. The downward\u2010sloping portion of this curve, as opposed to a continual increase in the translated products over time, would suggest a period where initial translation products are lost while replication is emphasized, followed by a new wave of translation when (+) vRNA levels reach suitable levels, i.e., an active switch from translation to replication. One HCV study also suggested that a translation/replication switch accompanied an increase in the core protein inhibiting translation.83 In addition, the combined presence of DDX6, an RNA helicase known to interact with the DENV 3\u2032\u2010UTR,84 and mir\u2010122 at the 5\u2032\u2010terminus of the HCV (+) strand, favors replication vs translation.85\n",
