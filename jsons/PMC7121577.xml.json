In general, before modeling authors have their own questions. They would then call a new model to be \u201cgood enough\u201d if it is able to answer their questions. One of the challenges with malaria is that it comes together with Anopheles mosquitoes and parasites\u2014Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae. Their organisms are much more complex compared to other pathogens with single-cell or even simpler- such as bacteria, archaea, viruses, etc. This can also partly explain why there are only few mathematical models concerning drug treatment in malaria.",

Usually, there are many individuals of the pathogen population which already have \u201cresistant\u201d mechanisms. They are naturally not eliminated by drugs. When infected people take medicine, it reduces sensitive parasites and makes good environment for resistance growth.\u2013In malaria, parasite organisms are very complex, they would either mutate or adapt variously. They have a better chance to survive after natural selection and maintain their best genetic system. Hence, their new generations are more \u201cfit\u201d in a drug environment.\u2013Another important reason for drug resistance is that malaria is more widespread in tropical countries, like in Africa, where it is difficult to have a global policy to treat all patients in a proper way.\n",

In history, there were many valuable contributions by Ross, MacDonald, May, Dietz, see [1, 5] and references therein. However, resistance was not well investigated. Mathematicians have only recently started to pay attention to this field. Two recent malaria models concerning drug resistance came from Aneke [2] and Esteva et al. [6]. Here the authors described a model of hosts and vectors dealing with both resistant and sensitive strains. In these papers and also some other cases, authors focus on analyzing the models to establish positive equilibrium and studying their stability under certain assumptions. Although in [6] the authors tried numerical simulation, they said that the model needed to be validated using realistic epidemiological data. So far there was very few data available to calibrate malaria and other vector-borne disease models.",

However, we need them avoid the high (sensitive) parasite density in infected humans, e.g. to keep the average parasite density in human blood below a specific level. Here our model can serve as the potential basis for the control problems, providing an optimal strategy of treatment. We can optimize the proportion (or number) of infected human population which need to be treated with full doses.In case of malaria, our model simulations suggest that parasite mutation and drug adaptation both play big roles in resistance. In quantitative sense, the simulation shows that: when drug with long half-life is employed, drug adaption is dominant. This is not the case with short half-life drugs. So the shorter the drug half-life is, the fewer resistant parasites are newly created.For the first time of treatment, our simulations show that the outcome of different drug treatments are quite similar. It is explained by the fact that in Burkina Faso, not many people have access to treatment. Most of the drugs are too expensive for the region, especially in a village like Cisse, where our data come from.That is why in Burkina Faso or similar regions in Africa, treatment can start with any drug and later switch to a new therapy when the resistant pathogens to the old drugs become dominant. This shows clearly efficacy since most of the parasites which resist to the old drug are sensitive to the new one.We also consider different regions with different drug usage. In Asia, antimalarial drugs are sold openly and any person can buy them without prescription from doctors. For most patients, treatment is not their first time. We observe in our simulations that the drug therapies and their efficacies strongly influence the overall treatment results.\n",
