The diagnosis relies on a systematic assessment of these possible causes using the DIRECT approach (10.1007/978-3-642-15742-4_2 in the diagnosis strategy). In our patient, the time from symptom onset to admission was 15 days, and the alteration in cellular immune deficiency associated with Hodgkin\u2019s disease suggested infection with intracellular bacteria. Radiographic findings before ICU admission were normal. Our patient had a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, and cardiogenic edema was therefore a possibility. He received bleomycin and was a smoker. Based on these features, the most likely diagnoses were infection (bacterial, viral, or parasitic), cardiogenic edema, and pulmonary toxicity [1]. Bleomycin toxicity has been evaluated in a study of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease [3]. Of 141 patients, 18% experienced bleomycin toxicity. The ABVD chemotherapy regimen, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, radiation therapy, and age older than 40 years were associated with bleomycin toxicity. Overall 5-year survival was 63% in the patients with bleomycin toxicity and 90% in the other patients (P = 0.001) [1].",
