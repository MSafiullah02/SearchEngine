The gold standard is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)ebased system taking several hours to confirm positivity. For effective public health containment measures, this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a highprevalence community setting. Study design: Thirty-nine randomly selected individuals at a COVID-19 screening centre were simultaneously tested via qPCR and a rapid test. Ten previously diagnosed individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection were also analysed. Methods: The evaluated rapid test is an IgG/IgMebased test for SARS-CoV-2 with a time to result of 20 min. Two drops of blood are needed for the test performance. Results: Of 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR. In contrast, the rapid test detected only eight of those positive correctly (sensitivity: 36.4%). Of the 27 qPCR-negative individuals, 24 were detected correctly (specificity: 88.9%).

While rapid point-ofcare testing is critically needed, the current evaluation of an antibody-based system demonstrates only low sensitivity and is therefore not recommendable to detect potential infections as a stand-alone test. Indeed, studies demonstrated that seroconversion occurred sequentially for IgM and then IgG with a median time of 11 and 14 days, respectively.
