            "text": "The emergence of supramolecular chemistry has brought a revolutionary new era for the progress of chemistry [1, 2] , and supramolecular chemistry has been growing rapidly at an ever-increasing pace. A great deal of effort has been made directly toward supramolecular chemistry and numerous excellent achievements have been obtained [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Supermolecules (or supramolecules) have generally been described as aggregates formed by two or more molecules through non-covalent bonds. According to the concept of supermolecules, to some extent, the inorganic and organic complexes could be relegated to supermolecules. It was generally considered that both inorganic and organic complexes were principally formed through non-covalent bonds. Inorganic (metal) complexes are aggregates mainly formed in general by the coordination bonds, while organic complexes are aggregates mostly formed by hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds and/or Van der Waals force and so on. The complexes (aggregates) formed by inorganic compounds and inorganic compounds and/or organic compounds could be regarded as inorganic supermolecules. Take the anticancer drug cisplatin for example, this drug was usually considered to be the inorganic metal complex formed by one molecule of inorganic compound PtCl 2 and two NH 3 molecules through coordination bonds, this complex was an aggregate of three molecules formed through non-covalent bonds (here generally considered to be coordination bonds), therefore, cisplatin could be called inorganic (complex) supermolecule. Similarly, the complexes (aggregates) formed by organic compounds and organic compounds could be regarded as organic (complex) supermolecules. Considering the complex of \u03b2-cyclodextrin with anticancer drug adriamycin (doxorubicin), it was found that organic molecule \u03b2-cyclodextrin with another organic molecule anticancer adriamycin in aqueous solution formed the 1:1 host-guest complex. The drug adriamycin was generally considered to enter into the cavity[0] of macrocyclic compound cyclodextrin, in some cases it was often called (organic) inclusion complex. This complex was an aggregate formed by one molecule of \u03b2-cyclodextrin and one molecule of adriamycin mainly through non-covalent bond forces such as hydrophobic interaction, Van der Waals interaction and so on. Therefore, it could be fairly said such complex was organic supermolecule. Supermolecules or polymolecular assembly, formed by the weak interactions of non-covalent bonds via self-process, self-assembly and/or self-organization, showed distinct chemical, physical and biological properties in comparison with the original molecule components. These supramolecular systems exhibited some specific functions, being capable of being used as conductors, magnetic materials, sensors, etc., and thus they possessed wide potential applications in chemistry, physics, materials, information and environmental sciences and so on. Particularly, in materials field, the unprecedented progress has been made, and it has opened up a wholly new and infinite space to create new matters and novel materials. Supramolecular chemistry was originated from the living biological systems to some extent. Supramolecular systems, formed by weak interactions of non-covalent bonds, exist extensively in numerous vital biological processes. For examples, chlorophylls in plant photosynthesis are magnesium tetrapyrrole complex supermolecules, while Haem in Haemoglobin, playing important roles in uptake and transport of oxygen, are the iron complex supermolecules of porphyrin ring. In the living biological systems, the supramolecular hosts are various kinds of enzymes, receptors, genes, antibodies of immune system, ionophores, etc., while the guests are substrates, inhibitors, antigens, drugs and so on. The synergistic cooperations between hosts and guests play important roles for biological processes in the living biological systems. Therefore, to some extent, it might be said that living biological system is a huge and particular excellent biological supramolecular system [14, 15] . It was worth mentioning that vitamin B 12 was the cobalt macrocyclic complex supermolecule, and its discoverers earned the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry [4] . Organisms just take use of this type of bioactive organization \u23af biological supramolecular system \u23af to participate in the synergistic reactions of various substances in cells, and then perform efficiently and controllablely the biological processes of organisms. The utilization of interactions of noncovalent bonds, in attempts to study molecular recognition, regulate and control, model or mimic enzyme catalysis in biological processes, DNA binding, membrane transport, cell-cell recognition, as well as investigate drug interactions, etc., has become the unusually active research area of supramolecular chemistry in life sciences [2] [3] [4] 9, 10, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , which provided a new way available for the research and development of new drugs. The highly interdisciplinary researches in this field were considered to be one of the important sources for new concepts and high-tech. The non-covalent interactions in biological supramolecular system should be highly useful for the development of supramolecular drugs. However, surprisingly, the word \"supramolecular drug\" has been seldom mentioned up to now [33] .",

            "text": "Along with the extensive expansion of supramolecular chemistry and understanding the concept of supermolecule, it is inevitable to expand into the pharmaceutical sciences. Supramolecular drugs, i.e. supramolecular chemical drugs, can be defined as medicinal supermolecules (or supramolecules) formed by two or more molecules through non-covalent bonds. With the further development of supramolecular chemistry, exploring the application of the supramolecular systems as drugs in pharmaceutical sciences has attracted great interests. Since the discovery of inorganic platinum complex cisplatin with anti-tumor activity, the researches of inorganic metal complex supermolecules in the medicinal field have been paid increasing attention [34, 35] . Inorganic compounds both PtCl 2 and NH 3 are not anticancer drugs, but their cisplatin complex formed through noncovalent bonds was used widely in clinic as anticancer drug. To some extent, it was fair to say that the anticaner drug cisplatin has opened up a new era for the research and development of new drugs. This led numerous endeavours toward inorganic complex supermolecules as drugs formed by inorganic metal compounds with inorganic compounds such as NH 3 and/or organic compounds (diamines, porphyrins, etc.). In particular, supramolecular inclusion complexes [36, 37] , formed by organic macrocyclic compounds cyclodextrins and their derivatives as hosts with guest drugs, not only could improve the water solubility of original drugs, control drug release in the body, help the drug to deliver to the target organ, or even eliminate abnormal flavour of drugs, but also effectively improve the pharmacokinetics properties of drugs, increase the bioavailability and efficacy and so on. These special excellences for drugs encouraged and attracted numerous workers engaging in the research and development of supramolecular drugs. Currently, the researches in supramolecular drugs are quite active and the progresses are unusually rapid, and this area is becoming an emerging highly interdisciplinary field with enormous potential, and gradually becoming a relatively independent scientific area. To date, a large number of supermolecules as chemical drugs have been widely used in clinics. Supermolecules as chemical drugs, i.e. supramolecular chemical drugs or supramolecular drugs, might possess not only less expense, shorter time and larger possibility as clinic drugs for their successful research and development, but also safety, lower toxicity, less adverse effect, higher bioavailability, better biocompatibility and drug-targeting, fewer drug-resistances and better curative effects, and exhibit extensive potential as clinical drugs. These overwhelming advantages have been enormously paid special attention. So far, no work has reported the current whole situation of supermolecules as chemical drugs in medicinal field. In view of this, combining with authors' researches and referring other works from literatures, this work reviewed the recent advances in the research and development of supermolecules as chemical drugs in antitumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimalarial, antibacterial, antifungal, antivirus, anti-epileptic, cardiovascular agents and magnetic resonance imaging agents and so on. The perspectives of the foreseeable future and potential application of supramolecules as chemical drugs were also presented.",

The \u03b2-CD with appropriate size and shape of cavity could bind efficiently with a series of hydrophobic aromatic guests, and also was widely investigated and applied because of its low price. For instance, anticancer drug doxorubicin and \u03b2-CD could form 1:1 inclusion complex (1). This supermo-lecule remarkably improved the water solubility of doxorubicin, and enhanced its efficacy as drug. The inclusion complex of trans-dichloro(dipyridine) platinum(\u2161) (DDP) with \u03b2-CD was a novel class of water-soluble anticancer supermolecule (2) . Its anticancer activities surpassed significantly that of cisplatin, and the growth inhibition by the prepared CD-DDP complex against CT26 and B16F10 cell lines in vitro was found to be 4.6 and 6.1, respectively, times higher than cisplatin [39] .",

In recent years, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become the fourth new and reliable treatment for cancer after operation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy [46, 47] . Porphyrin-based anticancer drugs generally act as photosensitizer to generate photodynamic reactions when light at appropriate wavelength was applied, give highly active singlet oxygens, and then destroy the target cells. Now, the widely used drugs in clinic are hematoporphyrin derivatives, the first generation of photosensitizers with high phototoxicity and dark toxicity.

Its principle is the interaction of radiationless nucleus 10 B and low-energy neutron to generate cytotoxic 4 He and 7 Li. The supermolecule 10 formed by borane and porphyrin through linkage could accumulate in cancer cells, and thus reduce the adverse effects of radiotherapy greatly. On the basis of the structural features and anticancer activities of both porphyrin and azole compoundds [48, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] , we designed and synthesized several novel dissymmetric porphyrin compounds, and then linked with clinical anticancer drug tegafur and nitroimidazoles [63] possessing radiosensitizing effects, to afford tegafur and nitroimidazole porphyrins respectively [58] . The new porphyrin compounds modified by tegafur gave better anti-tumor activity against liver cancer cell SMCC-7721 and colon cancer Volo in vitro. Compared to the anticancer drug tegafur under the same concentration, tegafur-linked porphyrin complex supermolecules (11, 12) also could inhibit the growth of SMCC liver cancer cells to some extent, and their antitumor activi-ties have been improved significantly. The results suggested that the introduction of metalloporphyrin effecttively improve the anti-tumor activity of tegafur. The tumor control rate could reach 36.6% when administration of tegafur to a nude mouse, while supermolecule 11b resulted in the tumor control rate up to 70.0% in vivo. The higher tumor control rate of complex 11b in comparison with tegafur further revealed that the introduction of metalloporphyrin effectively improve the anti-tumor activity of tegafur. The nitroimidazole-based porphyrin compounds, especially complex 12, gave better radiosensitization against human cervical cancer cell Helo. Compared to 4-nitroimidazole or 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole at the same molarity, some of metal complexes in supermolecule 12 showed 95% tumor control rate with six times higher than the free ligand.",

These problems could be solved by the help of new drug delivery systems. Among these, the most extensive investigation was to use polymers as drug carriers. Drugs were encapsulated into the carrier to form various kinds of supramolecular drugs, like liposomes and nanoparticles ones, etc. [96] . The delivery systems of liposomes and nanoparticles have merits of increasing solubility, prolonging retention time in vivo, enhancing drug-targeting, decreasing toxicity and overcoming anticancer multidrug resistance. So far many of these supramolecular preparations like liposomes or nanoparticles have been used in clinic. They effectively diminished the side effects, made prophylaxis of cancer and relieved pain caused by cancer deterioration and chemotherapy [97] , and made it possible to adopt original and better chemotherapy method upon present drugs. It has been an important research area in worldwide for a long time that the antitumor agents would be developed as liposomal drugs. Many antitumor liposomes have been developed, such as platinum liposomes like paclitaxel magnetism liposomes, cisplatin invisible liposomes SPI-077 and oxaliplatin liposomes Lipoxal, doxorubicin temperature sensitive liposomes and doxorubicin long-circulation liposomes DOXILR and so on. The research showed that encapsulation of doxorubicin in polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes could enhance the safety and efficacy of conventional doxorubicin. In preclinical models, liposomal-doxorubicin could relieve and treat many types of cancers including tumors of the breast, lung, ovaries, prostate, colon, bladder, and pancreas, as well as lymphoma, sarcoma, and myeloma. It was also effective as adjuvant therapy. In addition, it was found to penetrate into the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the growth of tumors in the central nervous system. The combination of liposomes with vincristine or trastuzumab resulted in synergistic effects and better efficacy. Liposomes appeared to overcome multidrug resistance, possibly as the result of increased intracellular concentrations and an interaction between the liposome and P-glycoprotein, and showed favorable applications to treat a variety of cancers [98] . Therefore, it is an important trend to improve anticancer drugs by developing liposomes as long-circulation preparation, and exploiting a variety of liposoms which are new and aggregated in local tumor in high concentration.",

Recent years, the clinical values of nanomaterials have been becoming more and more important, and nanoparticles were paid more attention to act as anticancer drugs carriers [100] . Nanotherapy enhanced the drug accumulation in tumor tissue and stepped down the growth of tumor. Some anticancer nanoparticles have been approved by FDA to use in clinic. At present, much work focused on nanoparticles of paclitaxel, mitomycin, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and platinum drugs. Some nanotechniques were also employed to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. Researches revealed that paclitaxel nanoparticles prepared by the nanoprecipitation method have shown comparable activity to traditional formulations, like the introduction of solubilizing agent or preparation of cyclodextrins inclusions, with much faster drug release rate and the prolonged action time [101] .

Both dextran and doxorubicin were encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles, and then were injected intravenously into mice, it was found a decrease in the tumor volume, and better efficacy in comparison with both dextran and doxorubicin [104] . Some nanoparticles, formed by the self-assembly of block copolymers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, have the unitary caryo-crust structures. Hydrophobic domains could be used as carrier for hydrophobicity drugs, while hydrophilic domains make particles stable in aqueous solution [105] [106] [107] . These nanoparticles could enhance the solubility of drugs and prolong effective action time, but they could not target toward tumor cells with high efficacy. Therefore, a novel dual targeting strategy was developed and could maximize drug delivery efficacy to tumor cells. For example, folate-PEG-PCL has been developed to encapsulate superparamagnetic Fe 3 O 4 and to deliver an anticancer drug, doxorubicin, to tumor cells. The dual targeting strategy opened up several opportunities for enhancing drug delivery efficiency and cancer specificity during chemotherapy [108] .",

This can not only enhance the stability and prevent fast decomposition, but also control effectively drug release and improve the anticancer activity. Cisplatin encapsulated in PDEA-PEG nanoparticles had higher cytotoxicity than the free drug on SKOV-3 cells. The research on intraperitoneally ovarian tumors of mice indicated that the apoptosis activity induced by cisplatin/PDEA-PEG nanoparticles was about twice that of by the free cisplatin. The platinum(\u2163) complex 40, which was nearly nontoxic to testicular cancer cells, displayed a significantly enhanced cytotoxicity profile when attached to the surface of the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) [110] . The important reason is that the soluble nanotubes internalized the platinum(\u2163) complex through endocytosis, providing six times the concentration that the untethered complex is able to achieve on its own. Then the acidic environment facilitates release of platinum as its core complex by reduction and concomitant loss of the axial ligands and exhibits cytotoxicity.",

Its clinical appearance includes redness, warmth, swelling and pain as well as functional disturbance. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs are a class of drugs against fever and pain, inflammation and rheumatism. Due to its exceptive anti-inflammatory activity, this class of drugs was called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in 1974 international conference at Milan in Italy. Aspirin is the representative of this type of drugs [111] . Aspirin, the first NSAIDs used in clinic, was a milestone for the use of synthetic drugs to treat inflammation. After this, the NSAIDs expanded to more than one hundred species, and became the first choice to treat osteoarthritis and arthritis pauperum. However, the high gastro-intestinal side effect confined their applications. The complexation of NSAIDs with metal ions could significantly reduce gastric toxicity and some even enhance analgesia and anti-inflammatory activities.",

The analgesic behavior of Zn(\u2161)-baclofen complex was better than that of the parent drug [121] . Recently, a series of Pd(\u2161) complexes of compounds 48(a-c) as ligands respectively [122] have been reported, and their anti-inflammatory activity was 10%-15% stronger than that of the standard drug declofenac. Furthermore, some Sn(\u2163)/Ru(\u2161,\u2162)-NSAIDs complexes have also been prepared and characterized [123, 124] , but few studies were involved in their anti-inflammatory activity. Organotin(IV) complexes of 2-maleimidoacetic acid displayed stronger analgesic activity than its parent, while phthalimido-4-methyl pentanoate(PMPA) organotin(\u2163) esters showed less activity than the ligand [125, 126] . Not only the NSAIDs metal complexes could reduce the gastro-intestinal damage of NSAIDs, but also the organic complex supramolecules formed by CD and their derivatives with NSAIDs, could improve their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics properties. Indomethacin-CD inclusion complex had no anabrosis side effect. Naproxen-\u03b2-CD significantly increased the water solubility, raised dissolution rate, facilitated absorption, degraded gastro-intestinal damage of naproxen and also possessed lower photoxicity after complexation with \u03b2-CD [127] . In addition, ibuprofen-\u03b2-CD complex also increased the aqueous solubility, absorption rate and bioavailability of ibuprofen. Coating with pH sensitive CD derivatives is a method of drug delivery to the site of action, for example, the anti-inflammatory effect of the Prednisolone succinate/\u03b1-CD (PDsuc/\u03b1-CD) inclusion complex was comparable to that of prednisolone (PD) alone, while its systemic side effect was much lower than that of PD alone when administered orally, this might be related to the specifical degradation of the inclusion complex in the large intestine [128] .",

In order to overcome these problems, modification of the enzyme with aqueous polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran and starch has been reported as useful accessory materials [129] .

Complex 51 was one type of ferroquine derivatives, among these supermolecules, most of them showed better activities than chloroquine. The 7-substituted 4-aminoquinoline moiety and length of the methylene spacer were major determinants for antimalarial activity [134] . For ferrocene triazacyclononane quinoline conjugate 52 [135] against the Dd2 strain, the IC 50 was 62\u00b112 nmol\u00b7L \u22121 , this showed that 52 was more efficient than chloroquine (IC 50 = 94\u00b18 nmol\u00b7L \u22121 ), but less active than ferroquine (IC 50 = 13\u00b11 nmol\u00b7L \u22121 ). These results showed the potential of ferrocenic bisquinolines complex 52 as antimalarial agents. However, its analogue ferrocenic mefloquine 53 exhibited lower antimalarial activity than both mefloquine and quinine [136] . Ferrocene complex 54 was synthesized by the linkage of thiosemicarbazones (TSC) with ferroquine [137] , and displayed a good antimalarial activity. Moreover, most of them gave more efficacy than ferroquine and chloroquine, possibly this was related to its aminoquinoline structure. Recently, a new series of ferrocenic pyrrolo[1,2-\u03b1] quinoxaline derivatives have been reported, which possessed better antimalarial activity than chloroquine, especially the complex 55 as the most potent candidate, but it was needed further structural modifications due to high toxicity [138] . Some Cu(\u2161) complexes also exhibited notable antimalarial activity. The complexation of pyridine-2-carboxamidrazones with copper(\u2161) salts could enhance antimalarial activity significantly [139] , these results attracted many researchers' great interests in organic Cu(\u2161) complexes as antimalarial agents. Copper(\u2161) complex of buparvaquone [Cu(buparvaquone) 2 -(C 2 H 5 OH) 2 ] was found to give stronger antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum strain than its Ni(\u2161), Co(\u2161), Fe(\u2161) and Mn(\u2161) complexes [140] , and exhibited better antimalarial activity both in vitro and in vivo than the parent drug buparvaquone.

The environment around the metal center, for example, coordination geometry, number of coordinated ligands and their donor groups, is the key factor for metalloprotein to carry out specific physiological functions. The schiff base, containing phenolic hydroxyl group or aromatic heterocycle with three nitrogen atoms, phosphoric acid and phosphonate ester as well as their corresponding metal complexes showed significant antibacterial activities which received considerable attention. Among these complexes, copper complexes were the most important class with good antibacterial activity, and the related work has been reviewed in details [163] . The oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms in schiff bases containing phenolic hydroxyl group could chelate with many transition metals, and show their biological activity. For example, the Ru(\u2161)-complex of schiff base derived from vanillin 67 showed significant activity against S. aureus and E. coli, and its antibacterial efficacy was higher than that of corresponding ligands [164] . Structural similar ligand naphthylideneimine derivatives exhibited little biological activity, but their Ru(\u2161)complex 68 showed moderate activity against S. aureu and E. Coli [[165] .

Much effort has been expended to study the coordination chemistry of rhenium, the oxorhenium( \u2164) complexes of mixed ligands 111(a-d) showed excellent antifungal activities against A. alternata and A niger and better efficacy than some well known antibiotics Dalacin C and Flumox [207] .",

            "text": "Besides well-known antibacterial activity, silver sulfadiazine was reported to possess strong antifungal properties. Their mechanism of antifungal action seemed to be different from that of the azole antifungal drugs. By the inhibition of phosphomannose isomerase, they were to inhibit the biosynthesis of yeast cell walls and gave antifungal properties. It was known that the zinc enzyme has a specific binding site for silver ions, and this is important for its inhibition by the sulfanilamide complexes. Using silver sulfadiazine as lead molecule, the new zinc complex of sulfacarbamide 112 was synthesized, and proved to act as effective antifungal agents against several A. flavus, A. fumigatus and Candida spp, but slightly weaker activities than standard ketoconazole [208] . The cobalt complexes of sulfathiazolate (ST), [Co(ST) 2 (H 2 O) 4 ], showed better antifungal activity against A. flavus and A. fumigatus than ST [209] . superior to that of ketoconazole (MIC 80 =25 \u00b5mol\u00b7mL \u22121 ) [210] . Dithiocarbazate and its substituted compounds coordinated with many metals could form biological active supermolecules, and among them the copper complexes possessed best antifungal activity [211] . Thiabendazole, with structural similarity to the chelating agents 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2\u0384-bipyridine, is a well-known anthelmintic agent and fungicide in agriculture with poor anti-candida activity. However, its copper complex 114 was an activity-strong supermolecule with effective inhibition in growth of C. candida strains [212] . The substituents in the aromatic rings have effect on antifungal activity. It has also been found that in general the complexation of schiff bases with iron, copper, zinc and other metals also influences their antifungal activity. Makkar et al. found that cobalt complex of ethylidene-aniline 115 gave moderate antifungal activity against A. alternata, F. oxysporum and M. roridum [213] . Acylhydrazones constitute an interesting class of chelating agents, their metal complexes may have potential use in the biological fields. The metal(\u2161) complexes of benzoylhydrazone 116 and 117 showed a significant antifungal activity against Rizoctonia sp., Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp. [214] . Among them, the most extensively investigation was heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones and their metal complexes. The nickel(\u2161) complexes of 5-methyl-2-furfural thiosemi-carbazone were found to exhibit moderate antifungal activity against human pathogenic fungi, A. fumigatus and C. albicans. Although their activities were weaker than their similar copper complexes, lower toxicity was observed [215] . The copper complex formed with 6-methyl-2-formylpyridine-N-dimethyl thiosemicarbazone is fungitoxic against the phytopathogenic fungi, A. alternata, F. equiseti and M. phaseolina, but it was less active than the free ligand [216] . Besides the above complexes with effective antifungal activities, copper(\u2161) complexes of sterically hindered catechol derivatives exert pronounced antifungal properties against A. niger, Fusarium sp., P lividum, Mucor sp. and B. cinerea [217] . The antifungal activities of Cu(\u2161), Co(\u2161) and Ni(\u2161) complexes of (2-hydroxyethyl)thiobenzene-1,2-diol 118 against 8 fungi showed that the copper complex was the most active supermolecule [218] . The marketed antifungal agents such as amphotericin B and viroconazole were changed to form liposome or nanoparticle supermolecules, they can not only improve the drug targeting and but also reduce the times of administration.

INH is a good metal ion chelator, and can be coordinated with Mn(\u2161), Co(\u2161), Ni(\u2161), Cu(\u2161), Zn(\u2161), Cd(\u2161), Pb(\u2161) and rare earth metal ions to form stable complexes and thus ameliorate their liposolubility. Vigorita et al. [219, 220] prepared the Cu(\u2161), Ni(\u2161) and Co(\u2161) complexes of INH, and found that complex 119 exhibited higher Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv growth inhibition than the parent drug. After that, this group reported Ni(\u2161) complex of isoniazid 120 [221] , and the complex 120b displayed 10-fold higher activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv (MIC = 0.025 \u03bcg\u00b7mL \u22121 ) than rifampin and equal to isoniazid. N 1 -Benzylidene-pyridine derivatives exhibited moderate anti-TB activities. In order to improve their anti-TB efficacy, Padhye et al.

Its application was limited to some extent because of rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains. Lately, its metal complexes were found to enhance remarkably the anti-TB activities, such as copper(\u2161) complex of ciprofloxacin (cf) 122. Possibly, the formation of organometal complexes increased its liposolubility, made it easier to penetrate into the bacterial cell, and at the same time, Cu(\u2161) ion was reduced to give copper(\u2160) species intracellularly resulting ultimately in oxygen activation which is detrimental to the mycobacteria. This result revealed that metal complexes with reducibility should be valuably helpful for the design of highly active antitubercular drugs [223] . On the basis of this, Padhye et al. [224] again reported a mixed-ligand Cu(\u2161) complex containing ciprofloxacin and phenanthroline 123, but this mixed-ligand Cu(\u2161) complex did not enhance the antitubercular activity, this might be related to phenanthridine to stabilize the cupric species and degrade reduction activity of cupric species.",

The entry of HIV into the cells requires the sequential interaction of the virus with a co-receptor CXCR4, therefore CXCR4 can serve as a target for the research of new drugs, and this is a new breakthrough for anti-HIV therapy. Bicyclams AMD3100 is a favorable CXCR4 antagonist, it can inhibit replication of both X 4 and X 4 /R 5 types of HIV [229] . Compound AMD3100 displayed significant activity against HIV virus, unfortunately, it was found to have significant side effect to heart leading to its withdrawal from further development as an anti-HIV agent in phase \u2161 studies.

CTC-23 (129) was the first reported Co(\u2162) organic complex with antiviral activity, and displayed moderate activity against HSV-1 [234] . Its analogue CTC-96 (130) exhibited least toxicity and best activity among these series of complex supermolecules against HSV-1 and HSV-2. CTC-96 accelerated herpetic dendritic keratitis recovery better than trifluorothymidine as reference drug [235] . In addition to above complexes with antiviral activity, cobalt(\u2162) hexammine complex also exhibited significant antiviral activity. The IC 50 value against Sindbis virus-infected cells is 0.13\u00b10.04 mmol\u00b7mL \u22121 [236] . Ruthenium(\u2161) complex [H 4 Ru 4 (\u03b7 6 -p-benzene) 4 ] 2+ was active against the Polio virus without inhibiting the growth of human cells [237] .",

The inclusion complexes of \u03b2-CD or HP-\u03b2-CD with the drug nifedipine, nitrendipine, captopril, nicardipine and nimodipine separately were confirmed to improve effectively the stability, bioavailability and solubility of these drugs, and the double-layer tablets of nifedipine encapsulated by 2-HP-\u03b2-CD and hydroxypropyl cellulose could satisfy with the need of different release rate by changing their component ratio [244] . Uekama et al. prepared the binary system formed by captopril with HP-\u03b2-CD or TB-\u03b2-CD and the ternary system of captopril/TB-\u03b2-CD/HP-\u03b2-CD in different molar ratios, and investigated their release behavior in dogs [245] . It was found that the release rate of captopril from the binary HP-\u03b2-CD system was rather fast, whereas that from the binary TB-\u03b2-CD system was comparatively slower, the retarding effect being dependent on the amounts of TB-\u03b2-CD. The release rate from the ternary captopril/TB-\u03b2-CD/HP-\u03b2-CD system was slowed down by the addition of small amounts of HP-\u03b2-CD, whereas the rate became faster as the molar ratio of HP-\u03b2-CD further increased (>0.25 molar ratio). The oral administration of the ternary captopril/TB-\u03b2-CD/ HP-\u03b2-CD system (molar ratio of 1:0.5:0.5) in dogs gave a plasma profile comparable to that of a commercially available sustained release preparation. Some works investigated comparably the solubility-enhancing efficacy of Nimodipine by the use of several CDs including HP-\u03b2-CD and their derivatives, and found that HP-\u03b2-CD resulted in better solubilizing efficiency than methyl-\u03b2-CD, which may be acceptable for the injectable preparation of parenteral nimodipine solutions [246] . Fernandes et al. [247] prepared the inclusion complex of triacetyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (TA-\u03b2-CD) with nicardipine hydrochloride (NC), and carried out dissolution investigation in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids in vitro. The result showed that release rate of the inclusion complex was consistent with zero order kinetics, and it was concluded that TA-\u03b2-CD can be used as sustained release preparation excipient.",

This NMR signal revealed the internal structural information of matter, and the later was measured and analysized to be able to give the corresponding physical and chemical information. Thus this technique exhibits important application values in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, etc. [251] . Since Lauterbur first used MRI in 1973, the MRI technique has been widely used in various biomedical domains as clinical diagnosis with no traumatic occlusion and multi-contrast. No matter in clinical diagnosis or fundamental researches, MRI has currently become an indispensable tool [252] . Its distinct feature is that the images are very clear for soft tissue.

            "text": "The introduction of some functional groups in the modification of the ligand backbone of the contrast agents could ameliorate their hydrophobicity to obtain the tissue-or organ-specific contrast agents. Currently, major research fields were involved in three types of targeting contrast agents including liver-targeting agents, tumor-targeting agents and blood pool agents. Some hydrophobic groups, such as long chain bisamide, aliphatic moiety and phenyl ring, have been incorporated into the backbone of these complexes to increase their hydrophobicity, facilitate them to be absorbed selectively by hepatic cell, and therefore possessed great potential as liver imaging contrast agents. The contrast agents Gd(BOPTA) and Gd(EOB-DTPA) have been in the stage of clinic trials. Supramolecular complex Gd-DTPA is a MRI contrast agent being used extensively in clinic. It belongs to ionic contrast agent with high osmotic pressure and short detention time in vivo, and is easy to excret from kidney metabolism, as well as has no tissue or organ specificity. Complex Gd-DTPA was modified to form electroneutral molecules, and thus exhibited much lower osmolality and toxicity in animals. The reaction of Gd-DTPA with bias-mides produced bisamido non-ion ligands such as Gd(DTPA-BDMA), Gd(DTPA-BDEA), Gd(DTPA-BIN) and Gd(cyclic-DTPA-1,2-pn) [258] . The animal expe-riments and MRI evaluation showed that four neutral Gd-DTPA bisamide derivatives gave good relaxation in bovine serum albumin, and possessed features of liver targeting, better water solubility, hypotoxicity, and long detention time in vivo. The Gd-DTPA derivative MS-325 (Vasovist, 135d) [259] showed favorable binding ability with human serum albumin (HSA) by using a bulky hydrophobic residue consisting of two phenyl rings attached to a cyclohexyl moiety linked, and reduced filtration of glomcrulus monomer, which resulted in low renal excretion rate and prolonged halflife time in blood vessel. Complex 135d is also the first Gd(\u2162)-based contrast agent for angiographic applications to proceed to human trials. Chong et al. also prepared a series of DOTA derivatives 138-141 [260] with liver targeting, these supramolecular complexes displayed higher relaxivity than standard Gd(DTPA) and Gd(DOTA). The Gd( \u2162 ) complexes of the piperidine backboned PIP-DOTA and PIP-DTPA displayed reduced kidney accumulation, compared with the nonspecific Gd(DOTA). The strategy to increase lipophilicity and rigidity of the chelate system and thus enhance heaptobiliary clearance and complex stability by incurporating either a piperidine or an azepane ring into the DTPA system appears desire for the design of liver specific MRI contrast agents. Gd(\u2162) complexes 138-141 are promising to act as MRI liver agents or nonspecific agents in clinic. Recently, many researches focused on Gd-DOTA derivatives. The complex P760 (142), a gadolinium macrocycle based on a DOTA structure that is substituted by hydrophilic bulky groups, had higher relaxivity and good biocompatibility [261] . In rabbits, 5 minutes after the injection of 142, the blood concentration of 1036\u00b1105 \u03bcmol\u00b7kg \u22121 was equivalent to the blood concentration of Gd-DOTA 1 minute after injection. Furthermore, the slow permeability process, increased the sensitivity of 142 for revealing permeability abnormalities, especially for tumor detection, and it displayed potential application. The complexes 143 and 144 were another two DOTA derivatives [262] , and lanthanide radionuclide chelates of 143 and 144, when linked to appropriate biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies or small peptides, were promising radiopharmaceuticals for MRI imaging. The Gd(\u2162) complex supermolecule of amphipathic macrocyclic polyamine 145 could have been used as pH responsive MRI contrast agents in vitro [263, 264] . The T 1 -relaxivity (r 1 ) of Gd(\u2162)-HADO-DO3A (145a) increased 142% on changing the pH from 6 to 8. The pH dependence was thought to arise from the formation of supramolecular structures caused by deprotonation of the amphiphilic complex at alkaline pH. These complexes are able to form supramolecular systems such as micelles and mixed micelles in aqueous solutions, in the presence or absence of surfactants. The formation of these supramolecular systems increased the efficacy of the contrast agent due to an increase in the rotational correlation time (\u03c4R) of the Gd(\u2162) complex. The novel bifunctional ligand 146 contains both acyclic and macrocyclic moieties [265] , and the compound 146c was fortuitously discovered during the preparation of 146b. The Gd(\u2162) complexes of 146(a-c) were prepared and indicated that Gd(\u2162) complexes of ligand 146 possessed higher relaxivity than Gd(C-DOTA). The supermolecules formed by the complexation of ligand 146 with radiolabeled atoms 177 Lu, 90 Y, 205/6 Bi and 153 Gd exhibited good stability with retention time of 11 days in serum. The ligand 146 may be further modified by conjugating to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and then be used as antitumor agents. Another aspect in the exploitation and application of contrast agents is to couple with macromolecule covalently, resulting in the enhanced relaxation efficiency and targeting property.",

In the near future, diseased region or organ targeting contrast agents with wide application will become a basic tool in medical diagnosis image. With the development of new MRI techniques, such as MR angiography (MRA), perfusion MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI and their extensive use in clinical diagnosis, the research and development of MRI contrast agents will be faced with greater challenges. The major trends in the research and development of MRI contrast agents will focus on the tissue-or organtargeting materials with high relaxivity and specificity, high contrast enhancement with low doses, low toxicity and side effects, and minimal expense.

Ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies indicated that the aromatic rings in side chain residues of L-tryptophan and L-tyrosine and butyl group in serine were incorporated into the hydrophobic cavity of DM-\u03b2-CD, and resulted in space conformational changement of peptide chain, prevented unstable sites from being attacked by prolease, and thereby enhanced the stability of buserelin [36] . Flutamide (FLT) is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, and the formed FLT-HP-\u03b2-CD complex could improve oral bioavailability relative to FLT suspension. Intravenous pharmacokinetic profiles for both FLT and FLT-HP-\u03b2-CD were identical [281] . Bary et al. [282] investigated the effect of HP-\u03b2-CD on bioavailability of hydrocortisone (HC) as ophthalmology administration in the rabbit from New Zealand, and found that HP-\u03b2-CD increased the bioavailability of HC in the cornea by 75% and enhanced permeability of cornea greatly.",

            "text": "As was mentioned above, supermolecules as chemical drugs formed by two or more molecules through the weak interactions of non-covalent bonds have been a quite rapidly developing, increasingly active and newly rising interdisciplinary highlight. Supramolecular drugs have been playing positive roles in many medicinal aspects such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimalarial, antibacterial, antifungal, antivirus, antiepileptic, cardiovascular agents and magnetic resonance imaging agents and so on. In particular, a lot of supramolecular drugs as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and magnetic resonance imaging agents etc. have been extensively used in clinic, and brought benefits to mankind. The supramolecular drugs might enhance effectively the stability and safety, decrease the toxicity, eliminate abnormal flavour, overcome multidrug resistance and reduce adverse effects, improve the drug-targeting, the biocompatibility and bioavailability and so on. All of these properties could improve greatly the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. More importance is that numerous supermolecules as clinical drugs' candidates are in actively ongoing research and development, and have shown that supermolecules as chemical drugs possess enormous potential. In addition, supramolecular drugs might spend less expense, take shorter time and have larger possibility as clinic drugs for their successful research and development, these virtues have been powerfully encouraging numerous researchers to engage in the research and development of novel supramolecular drugs. As predicting, it is inevitable that the research and development of supermolecules as chemical drugs will become increasingly active in near future. Currently, much important progress has been made in the research of supermolecules as chemical drugs. The hosts of supramolecular drugs were involved in cyclodextrins, porphyrins, polymers and some other structural compounds, and the guests themselves were drugs or non-drug molecules, but major researches in this field focused on the cyclodextrin, porphyrin and metal complexes. Thus it should be fairly said that the research of supramolecular drugs was still in their initial stage. With the further expansion of supramolecular chemistry and the deep investigation of the supramolecular drugs, the research and development of supramolecules as chemical drugs will be consequentially further extended. The key topic area to research in the future might mainly include the following eight aspects:",
