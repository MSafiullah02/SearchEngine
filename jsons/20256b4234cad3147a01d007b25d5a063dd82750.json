Antiviral antibodies (Abs) recognising viral glycoproteins or protein antigen displayed on the surface of virions or virus-infected cells are crucial in rendering the virus noninfectious and in eliminating viruses or infected cells, either acting alone or in conjunction with complement. In many instances, passive transfer of Abs is sufficient to protect from viral infection. Herpesviruses (HV) are equipped with a large array of immunomodulatory functions which increase the efficiency of infection by dampening the antiviral immunity. Members of the aand h-subfamily of the Herpesviridae are distinct in encoding transmembrane glycoproteins which selectively bind IgG via its Fc domain. The Fc-binding proteins constitute viral Fcg receptors (vFcgRs) which are expressed on the cell surface of infected cells. Moreover, vFcgRs are abundantly incorporated into the envelope of virions. Despite their molecular and structural heterogeneity, the vFcgRs generally interfere with IgGmediated effector functions like antibody (Ab)-dependent cellular cytolysis, complement activation and neutralisation of infectivity of virions. vFcgRs may thus contribute to the limited therapeutic potency of antiherpesviral IgG in clinical settings. A detailed molecular understanding of vFcgRs opens up the possibility to design recombinant IgG molecules resisting vFcgRs. Engineering IgG with a better antiviral efficiency represents a new therapeutic option against herpesviral diseases.

On the other hand, fine-tuning of the host defence strategies to avoid irreversible harm has led to activation of cellular and humoral immunity that tightly control herpesviral infections in a hierarchical but also redundant manner [5] . To date, eight human herpesviruses, most of which are widespread in the population, are known (listed in Table 1 ). In the majority of cases, the viruses cause relatively mild or even asymptomatic infections in the immmunocompetent host.

Therefore, a primary requirement is that the complement cascade becomes initiated only in response to infection and cannot be initiated in a random fashion. The complement factors opsonise and lyse Ab-coated viral particles (virolysis) and infected cells (cytolysis) [8, 9] .

The enhancing role of the Ab Fc part in direct neutralisation has been explained by an increased avidity of divalent Abs compared to monovalent Fab fragments [20] , or its mere size in steric occupation of the virus surface [21] .
