In other words, health is the result of a lifestyle in which human beings and nature are in harmony.15 This philosophy underpins the basic principles of traditional Chinese medicine, which takes a systems view of health. In traditional chinese medicine, human health is seen as the consequence of harmonisation between human beings and their environments and between the various parts of the human body and the focus is on disease prevention rather than treatment.16 Concepts from traditional Chinese medicine, such as the maintenance of regular daily activities (rest, diet, and exercise) and avoidance of negative health effects from environmental factors (eg, Fengshui) have become essential parts of Chinese culture. These concepts have much in common with the guidelines for healthy lifestyles promoted by WHO.17\n",

The China Urban Life Quality Indicator Survey, which has been done annually among residents of 38 cities since 2000, found that environmental issues were one of the top six issues of concern between 2000 and 2006; health care was among the top six issues for 11 consecutive years.23 Concerns about environmental pollution and associated health risks over the past decade mirrored increases in severe PM2\u00b75 pollution. A survey of perceived health risks from air pollution in Shanghai, Wuhan, and Nanchang found that more than 57% of respondents were not satisfied with current air quality; 46% of participants expressed anxiety about exposure to polluted air.24 Through social media, urban citizens in China are increasingly speaking out on issues that they believe are affecting their health and wellbeing. Environmental petitions and complaints have increased by more than 20% annually in recent years and mass protests for environmental issues are occurring across China.25 These new trends show a willingness on the part of the Chinese people to break away from the norm of focusing on economic growth and avoid politics. In response to these challenges, the central government has proposed the formation of a so-called ecologically civilised society that actively and structurally addresses these concerns. Local leaders in China are increasingly under pressure from the central government and the public to shift from growth-centred development to sustainable development policies that protect environmental quality and health.26\n",

In the past, health was just one of various goals for societal advancement and the central focus of health management was on the improvement of the health-care system.27 By contrast, the new plan presents health as the foundation for all socioeconomic development, calls for the integration of health into all policies, and emphasises the importance of addressing the environmental and social determinants of health.Panel 1Healthy China 2030The Healthy China 2030 plan was released by the State Council of China on Oct 25, 2016. It specifies that health management in China will focus on the promotion of healthy lifestyles, optimisation of health services, improvements in health care coverage, provision and protection of a healthy environment, and development of service industries in health care.Health will be highly prioritised in the development of public policy and incorporated into all stages of policy making. All actions will be guided by four principles: health first, reform and innovation, science-guided development, and equity.Health inequality between urban and rural areas and among different regions and population segments will be addressed through equal access to basic health services. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve health for all citizens. To achieve this aim, all citizens will need access to services and health issues at different stages of the life course will need to be addressed. The plan also identifies specific goals, such as to increase the average life expectancy of Chinese people to 79 years by 2030 (appendix). Action items for each focus area, such as to improve health literacy and to strength health education, are also included.",

Migrants from rural areas provide the labour force that is required for rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in China. In fact, it is the migration of 226 million rural residents to urban centrer between 2001 and 2010 that has dominated the increase in the country's urban population over the past 40 years of rapid urbanisation.38 According to the latest survey by the National Bureau of Statistics,39 which examined 445 Chinese cities, there were 137\u00b74 million migrant workers and 39\u00b71 million family members of migrant workers living in urban areas at the end of 2015. Most migrants (61\u00b73%) lived in east China, with the remaining migrants split among central (16\u00b74%), western (19\u00b75%), and northeastern (2\u00b78%) China. About 59\u00b79% of rural migrants lived in cities with more than 1 million residents.39 Migrant workers are expected to continue to contribute to the growth of the urban labour force through to 2030, with an estimated 6 million new migrant workers leaving rural areas for cities each year between 2013 and 2030.40 Although cities, especially large cities, are projected to continue to attract migrants, provinces in central China are likely to keep supplying migrants to more developed regions.31\n",

In 2010, life expectancy for urban male residents was 74\u201381 years across China's provinces compared with 67\u201374 years for rural male residents. Similarly, urban female residents had a life expectancy of 77\u201384 years compared with 69\u201378 years for rural female residents.1 Data from the past three national censuses (1990, 2000, and 2010) and a 1% sample census in 2015 show that the positive correlation between average life expectancy and the proportion of urban population at the provincial level became stronger as the latter increased (figure 2\n).",

Under China's unique governance structure (figure 3\n), cities are the most suitable entities to implement the new comprehensive health policies specified in the Healthy China 2030 plan. Although, in the past, health management policy focused on health care (making it largely the business of the health sector), cities in China are uniquely equipped to drive health care forward because future strategies will require a focus on a much broader set of social and environmental determinants, which are clearly beyond the scope of what the health sector can accomplish alone. In urban China, health departments sit at the same level in the governance structure as other municipal departments. Because departments compete for authority and resources to meet their individual goals, it is difficult to establish effective interdepartmental collaborations across sectors.57 Thus, city-level governments uniquely possess the required political power, economic and human resources, and institutional structures to implement the new health policies. Cities already allocate the largest portion of public health investment; for example, the split of public expenditures on health in 2011 was 10:20:70 for national, provincial, and city (including prefecture-level and county-level expenditures) levels.58 These resources will be key to the achievement of future gains in health in China, particularly because many health issues, such as those associated with infectious diseases, can only be tackled through coordinated actions across the urban\u2013rural spectrum.59 Cities are often better positioned to start and lead such efforts because China's governance system has historically used cities to control the countryside.60\n",

The International Energy Agency predicted that coal demand in China will decrease by 15% for 2016\u201340 but that the share of coal in the power mix will still be about 45% in 2040.86 Rapid urbanisation is also linked to the drastic increase in the ownership of private vehicles and a surge in the use of diesel trucks.87 Nationwide in 2006, vehicles are estimated to account for 24% of national NOx emissions, 29% of non-methane volatile organic compounds, and 20% of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, with even higher fractions in urban areas.88\n",

Annual water availability per person in China is only 34% of the world average.100 To manage the shortage of available water supplies, some cities limit water consumption on certain days or times, with adverse consequences for industrial output and domestic life. Cities sometimes switch to lower quality supplies to meet excess demand, with dire consequences for public health.

In particular, increasing contact rates among people in crowded urban areas, who are then connected to distant populations through transportation networks, make pandemic control difficult as conventional spatial barriers to transmission break down. The booming aviation industry and growth of international trade and tourism further increase the risk of imported infectious diseases.133 For example, a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing on March 15, 2003, is widely regarded as responsible for the long-distance transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome,134 and national highways further promoted the spread of the disease to places adjacent to Beijing, such as Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia.135 Another example is the 2009 outbreak of influenza A H1N1 (swine flu) in China, which was originally caused by cases imported through international air travel from Mexico;136 the subsequent domestic spread of the epidemic is thought to have been mostly through domestic flights and ground transportation (railways and highways). A 50% reduction in trans-city and local travel would have resulted in an estimated 50\u00b72% reduction of total cases.137 International travellers also increase the risk of vector-borne diseases faced by China, as was the case for the unprecedented 2014 outbreak of dengue in Guangzhou, which accounted for 52% of all cases in China for 1990\u20132015.138\n",

For example, a survey165 in Shenzhen estimated that 34\u00b74% of migrant workers had mental health problems. However, only a small portion of people have been diagnosed and treated. For example, only 8\u00b73% of those with a major depressive disorder were diagnosed and of those, just 51\u00b75% were currently being treated.161 Rising medical costs are a further economic burden for patients, with the average annual cost per patient increasing from $1095 in 2005 to $3665 in 2013.166 Major depressive disorders substantially affect individuals and society. People with such disorders reported lower health-related quality of life scores and had lower productivity and resource utilisation.163\n",

In the 1970s, China was a model of health equity for the rest of the world for its provision of universal health care. However, the first health reform, which stretched from the mid-1980s to the end of the 1990s, changed China's health-care system permanently. The reform successfully introduced market mechanisms but undermined universal access to health care. In 1981, 70% of the population was covered by three insurance schemes: the Government Insurance Scheme, the Labor Insurance Scheme for urban residents, and the Co-operative Medical System for rural residents. Preventive care was provided by the government at nearly zero cost to recipients. During the reform, many people lost their insurance coverage when state-owned enterprises were shut down and when collective farms were dismantled. Coverage under all insurance schemes dropped to 20% in 1993.184 Because of these and other factors, health inequity across sex, age groups, and geographic locations is increasing in terms of disease burdens and life expectancy. For example, life expectancy for men in Tibet in 1990 was 18\u00b79 years (95% uncertainty interval 16\u00b70\u201321\u00b78) shorter than their counterparts in Shanghai; life expectancy for women was 21\u00b74 years (18\u00b77\u201324\u00b73) shorter. Less developed regions also had higher burdens of infectious disease (eg, tuberculosis) than did developed regions.56\n",

Large-scale government investment has resulted in mass construction of basic infrastructure in cities. In 1978, fixed-asset investment in urban service facilities was \u00a51\u00b72 billion (about $2\u00b77 billion when adjusted for inflation) nationwide, but this figure reached \u00a51\u00b76 trillion ($257\u00b78 billion) in 2015.216 This investment has helped to improve water and gas supplies, heating, road and rail transit systems, sewerage and wastewater treatment, waste management, and flood control, while improving the design and aesthetics of the urban landscape. One key example is the improved water services that have expanded across cities in China, achieving coverage of 98\u00b71% of urban residents in 2015 from just 53\u00b77% in 1981.216 This improvement might contribute to the lower mortality rate of oesophageal cancer in urban areas (89\u00b71 per 100 000 people) than in rural areas (285\u00b79 per 100 000 people) in 2015,64 because the consumption of untreated water from polluted sources has been positively associated with oesophageal cancer in rural areas.217 Greenspace and open space, including greenways, parks, and other urban conservation lands, has increased in 97% of prefecture-level cities because of its known benefits for urban quality of life, public health, and climate change adaptation.218 Governments at various levels have used large-scale urban development projects to target specific aspects of urban infrastructure. For example, between 2000 and 2010 in China, massive inner-city renewal and urban expansion projects progressively removed slum-like residences, replacing them with high-rise modern residential blocks.219\n",

The policies aimed to create better living environments for urban residents through the improvement of waste management and personal hygiene habits and the elimination of urban decay.220 Municipal governments launched major initiatives focusing on sanitation, urban infrastructure, and environmental protection. For a city, city district, or town to attain the title of National Hygienic City (or District or Town), it has to meet more than 100 criteria and pass an initial 3-year period of scrutiny and periodic unannounced inspections.6 As of March, 2015, 216 cities and 42 urban districts met these stringent criteria (appendix). There are also 679 National Hygienic Towns. Hygienic cities and districts performed better, on average, with respect to waste treatment, air pollution control, urban greening, infrastructure construction, and health promotion than did non-designated cities and districts.221\nPanel 3Weihai\u2014the first National Hygienic CityWeihai, a coastal city in Shandong province, was the first to be certified a National Hygienic City in 1990. The improvements to the urban environment made during and after the certification campaign have brought substantial health benefits to its 2\u00b78 million residents.To meet the stringent requirements, Weihai invested heavily in various urban environmental improvements. It has built facilities to process waste, achieved a 100% processing rate, and formed a partnership with New York City, NY, USA in 2016 to deal with ocean waste. Given its coastal location, coastline restoration and environmental management were prioritised. Weihai has controlled pollution in all urban rivers and grounded 66 000 cars that failed to meet emissions standards. It has also closed the door to companies with high energy consumption and pollution, turning down US$2 billion in foreign direct investment and \u00a520 billion ($3\u00b72 billion) in domestic investment between 1989 and 2012.As a result of these efforts, the water qualities of all city seashores in Weihai now meet national standards and Weihai ranks best in the country on this measure. Its air quality is consistently ranked the best in Shandong province. In 1997, Weihai was one of the first six cities to be certified as a National Model City for Environmental Protection. Life expectancy increased from 72\u00b70 years in 1985 to 81\u00b71 years in 2015, substantially exceeding the national average of 76\u00b734 years.11\nThe success of the National Hygienic City programme in Weihai is a result of the realisation by its leaders that efforts to achieve this status would help them protect the natural environment, which is a unique resource of the city. The title helps the city stand out from larger, more prominent Chinese cities and provides credibility in attracting both domestic and foreign direct investments. Weihai's example shows that tightly aligning a health programme with local government development pathways guarantees its success.",

The bike-sharing programme has reduced car use, alleviated traffic jams, and reduced emissions in cities, while satisfying urban residents' transportation needs in Chinese cities. Nationwide, the programme has saved users 760 million hours in commuting time. In addition, 1\u00b74 million tonnes of gasoline has been saved because of reduced car use; 4\u00b72 million tonnes of carbon and 3\u00b72 million tonnes of PM2\u00b75 emissions have been avoided.226 Bike sharing programmes are expected to continue to expand and become more popular. However, although this programme should be credited for making urban transportation greener, the traffic safety and parking issues associated with the explosive growth of bikes in cities have caused concern. City governments and the private sector should work together to solve these emerging problems.",

To tackle this issue, the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System was set up in 2004 with a mandate to monitor the occurrence of 37 infectious diseases, as laid out in the Law on Controlling Infectious Disease. By 2009, two more diseases were added to the reporting list. The national network reduces the average time between the identification of a disease case and its report to the Chinese Center for Disease Control from 29 days to under 24 h.236 Other national disease surveillance systems, such as the Disease Surveillance Points System, also track the occurrence of diseases and causes.

            "text": "Management of non-communicable diseases in China has shifted from disease treatment to prevention in the past decade. The promotion of healthy lifestyles has been prioritised and people in urban China are encouraged by governments to exercise more. Two national regulations, the Community Service System Construction Plan (2011\u20132015) issued in 2011 and the Urban Community Sports Facilities Construction Land Index issued in 2005, require that any new residential units must include spaces (including green spaces, open spaces, and yards) and exercise equipment, and specify the size and types of equipment for residential units of different sizes. Governments also provide incentives for people to participate in physical exercise, such as competitions and small awards. More recently, cities have experimented with allowing residents to charge the fee of using sports facilities to their medical insurance cards as a stimulus.246 The participation rate in moderate or vigorous physical activity outside of work among urban adults (\u226518 years) was as low as 7\u00b79% in 2001 but increased to 21\u00b76% in 2013.73 Cities are also getting serious about the control of tobacco use. By the end of 2016, more than 30 cities in China have passed or are in the process of passing regional regulations and laws that ban smoking in public indoor spaces. Among them, Beijing passed the strictest regulation on banning smoking in public spaces (panel 4\n). The move, once successfully implemented, will protect 20% of the country's population from second-hand smoking.247\nPanel 4Tobacco control in Beijing\u2014the strictest tobacco control policy in ChinaThe Beijing Smoking Control Ordinance, which was passed by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress in November, 2014 and came into effect on June 1, 2015, is one of the toughest tobacco control laws adopted in China to date.Under the law, smoking is prohibited in all indoor public places and many outdoor public places, such as kindergartens, schools, and child and maternal health centres. The law includes strong penalties for violations; for example, owners or managers of premises\u2014not just individual smokers\u2014are liable for fines if they fail to comply. In addition, the law bans tobacco advertising on mass media, in public places, outdoors, and on public transport.The capital's decision to adopt such a strong smoke-free law is important because other cities across China will seek to emulate Beijing's example. Both Shenzhen and Shanghai have since passed strong comprehensive smoke-free laws, thereby protecting well over 60 million Chinese citizens and residents from harmful exposure to second-hand smoke. More importantly, these cities have now set the benchmark for smoke-free policies for China.Successful enforcement of a smoke-free law in a city the size of Beijing\u2014with its myriad of offices, restaurants, bars, shops, and hotels\u2014is a colossal task. It requires a visible and ongoing enforcement effort, rigorous application of penalties for offending smokers and businesses, and substantial investment of resources in public education and awareness. The Beijing Government has worked hard to enforce the law since it came into effect. Health inspectors are out in large numbers around the city, checking venues and ensuring compliance with the law, supported by thousands of community volunteers. Beijing's residents are actively engaging in the enforcement effort through complaints to the 12320 hotline or through the hugely popular WeChat social media platform. The Beijing Tobacco Control Association has an interactive virtual map at its premises, which shows in real-time the movement of the tobacco control volunteers around the city and highlights venues or establishments that are being reported for their non-compliance. This use of integrated innovative technology is impressive and helps to support enforcement efforts.The effect the law has had is even more encouraging. Between May, and August, 2016, the Health Education Centre of Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention did a survey of 10 000 households from 16 districts in Beijing. The results showed a reduction in adult smoking rates (from 23\u00b74% in 2014 to 22\u00b73% in 2016); a reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke in various venues; an increase in the quitting rate among adults (from 14\u00b79% in 2014 to 16\u00b78% in 2016); an increase in public awareness of the harms of smoking; and a decrease in the number of adults who noticed tobacco advertisements at point-of-sale. Recent surveys have also shown that there is strong public support for 100% smoke-free laws.The Beijing smoke-free law is a major step forward in the battle against tobacco in China and the people of Beijing are now breathing easier as a result. The success of the law so far is owed to dedicated enforcement by the government and the high proportion of well educated people living in Beijing, which tend to be more supportive of smoking bans. In less developed regions, the implementation of the smoke-free law will probably face more resistance.",

Three major channels have been used to reach urban residents, including mass media, community organisations, and the education system. Mass media has a central role in disseminating health knowledge and information in China because more than half of Chinese people get their health knowledge from television.248 Community organisations are another effective way to improve health knowledge. The centralised government structure allows health information to be passed from the central government to the smallest communities in China. Cities are also offering health education classes through primary schools to high schools.249 In addition to these formal channels, cities in China came up with creative ways to disseminate health knowledge. For example, the Shanghai municipal government has given a free health package to 8 million households annually since 2010. The package contains publications on health, spoons to measure salt, an oil dispenser with measuring marks to reduce oil use in cooking, and tapes to measuring one's waistline. These small gifts have been very effective in communicating the concept of healthy lifestyle choices to a large population.250 These efforts have led to positive changes. For example, according to a 2015 survey of 10 000 urban residents in 44 cities, compared with 2013, consumption of carbonated soft drinks decreased by 21%, chewing gum by 15%, and western fast food by 16%. Further, 73% of survey participants participated in sports activities, which is simliar to the 70% reported in US cities.251\n",

The programme provides free screening to permanent urban residents aged 40 years or older and more than 4\u00b76 million people have been screened so far. About 0\u00b769 million high-risk people identified in the initial screening tests had further examinations, and those diagnosed received advice on treatment. The programme helps the health department to identify an increasing trend of stroke risk among people aged 40 years or older.252 Cancer screening services are now increasingly made available to at-risk populations through health insurance. For example, the proportion of women who had cervical cancer screening services reached 29\u00b71%, with a higher percentage seen in women with urban insurance coverage than in those without or with rural health insurance.253 Some cities even offer free physical examinations for all residents (panel 5\n).Panel 5Luzhou\u2013free physical examination for all residentsLuzhou city is located in Sichuan province and is formed of 5 million people living in a mountainous area of about 12 000 km2 in size. In June, 2016, the city started a project to offer free physical examination to all residents. The entire population of permanent residents was divided into five age groups: 0\u20136 years, 7\u201317 years, 18\u201334 years, 35\u201364 years, and 65 years or older. People in the 0\u20136 years, 7\u201317 years, and 65 years or older groups were entitled to free annual physical examinations. The rest were entitled to free biannual physical examinations. The physical examination includes routine tests, such as blood tests and liver function tests, and specific tests that were decided by each district (such as digital radiography of the chest). Examinations are done in health facilities or onsite for people who are handicapped or living in remote areas.1\u00b78 million residents were checked in 2016, of which 500 000 had never had a physical examination. The examinations showed that around 306 000 people had high blood pressure, 99 000 people had diabetes, and 40 000 people had another chronic disease. The results of each examination were electronically archived and grouped by families, villages, and communities before storage in community health centres. The archives are updated dynamically with information on subsequent examinations, treatments, and insurance reimbursement. Residents can look up their health information via an application on their mobile device. The examination results were also used to separate people into three groups: people who need routine health management, people who need specific attention, and people who need precise health management. The latter two groups include people with diabetes, high blood pressure, or severe mental health problems, high-risk pregnant women, and people at high risk of chronic disease. Each individual is assigned to a management team, which includes a physician and a local government staff. The team tracks the health status of the person and advises them on how they can manage their personal health.Two factors might have contributed to the successful implementation of the free-for-all physical examination in Luzhou. First, the population size of the city is relatively small by Chinese standards which keeps the expense at an acceptable level. Second, Southwest Medical University has been located in Luzhou since 1951. The medical university and its many associated medical agencies not only provide the human resources necessary for such a project but they also increase the health awareness of the residents in general.",

China started a campaign for the control of chronic diseases in 2010 aimed at four main types of chronic disease: cardiovascular disease, malignant tumour, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes. The campaign integrates disease surveillance, prevention, and treatment to form a comprehensive strategy. By the end of 2015, 265 counties, city districts, and county-level cities had been selected as national demonstration sites to receive this comprehensive approach.254 The management of mental disorders in cities also requires an increasingly comprehensive strategy. A grid model has been used in many cities to manage patients with mental disorder. The model is built on collaboration between public health service agencies and neighbourhood committees and involves measures that allows for discovering and treating patients in the community. These measures include health education, physical examination, regular doctor visits and reports of cases, patient registations, free treatments, and dealing with emergencies at the community level. The effectiveness of this model relies on the joint effort of patients' families, communities, and various government agencies.255 Results show that this comprehensive management is effective. A meta-analysis256 of studies between 2004 and 2015 showed that the recurrence rate of severe mental problems under comprehensive management is 32% of the rate in the control group.",

Self-management of chronic diseases in Shanghai has shown that identification of responsibilities, integration of multiple resources, and an emphasis on evaluation can make patient empowerment an efficient and effective mechanism for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and the achievement of improved health outcomes in patients suffering from these diseases, especially elderly people (panel 6\n).257 China has also participated in the community-based safety programme initiated by WHO since 2006 to prevent injury, violence and suicide. By November, 2011, China had 46 designated international safe communities and 244 designated national-level safe communities.147\nPanel 6Self-management of chronic disease in ShanghaiIn 2002, a randomised controlled trial of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme started in Shanghai. Initial results showed that the generic self-management education programme improved participants' health behaviour, self-efficacy, and aspects of their health status, and resulted in fewer visits to the emergency room and fewer admittances to hospital after 6 months. These successes were achieved through locally-based delivery models and the integration of routines of community government and community health services.In 2007, the Health Promotion Committee of Shanghai adopted the recommendation from the School of Public Health at Fudan University to disseminate chronic disease self-management through the network of the healthy city in Shanghai. Powerful policy support, defined responsibilities for the different actors, and active participation from the relevant population characterised Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme as a tool for the prevention and control of chronic illness. As of 2016, 420 000 people (most of whom were elderly) had been organised into 26 000 groups and participated in these activities. Guided by the principles of doctor\u2013patient cooperation, mutual aid, and self-management, the programme succeeded in creating a supportive environment for the prevention and control of chronic disease. Based on an evaluation of the programme in 2011, 63\u00b76% of group members had sufficient interactive health literacy, 34\u00b76% increased their physical activity significantly (45\u00b71% increased slightly); 32\u00b75% increased their vegetable and fruit intake significantly (46\u00b70%increased slightly); 24\u00b79% decreased their salt intake significantly (58\u00b70% decreased slightly), and 28\u00b73% decreased their oil intake significantly (55\u00b74% decreased slightly). In this analysis, women tended to be better at improving their lifestyle behaviours than men were.The qualitative analysis showed that members listed information exchange, shared experiences, and an improvement in mood as the biggest gains from participating in the self-management group. 58\u00b78% of members did voluntary activities, 50\u00b76% did activities organised by residential committees, and 47\u00b78% did activities organised by various interest groups.The Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme in Shanghai has been remarkably effective to date; it has empowered patients to make decisions on self-care and broader collective actions regarding chronic disease control. Its success in Shanghai can be attributed to the collaboration between Fudan university and the government. Given that Shanghai is the most developed region in China, the area's financial resources and well educated population contributed to the programme's success. Other large cities\u2014such as Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen\u2014could adopt the same programme.",

            "text": "The Chinese Government invested heavily to expand its health-care system and, as a result, the number of doctors (including assistant doctors), registered nurses, and hospitable beds increased substantially in urban areas in China. For 2010\u201315, the number of medical practitioners increased from 2\u00b797 to 3\u00b772 per 1000 people, registered nurses from 3\u00b709 to 4\u00b758 per 1000 people, and hospital beds from 5\u00b794 to 8\u00b727 per 1000 people.51, 260 The most notable example is Hong Kong, where government spending on health service is linked with economic growth and guaranteed by laws (panel 7\n).Panel 7Hong Kong\u2014guarantee health services with lawsHong Kong Special Administrative Region is a coastal city in the south of China that has one of the highest life expectancies in the world. In 2015, life expectancy at birth was 81\u00b72 years for men and 87\u00b73 years for women, which is above China's national average of 74\u00b76 years for men and 77\u00b76 years for women and the USA's average life expectancy of 76\u00b79 years for men and 81\u00b769 years for women.261 The city is unique because it is one of the few cities in China where the health-care system is not managed by the central government's National Health and Family Planning Commission or its subsidiary local health bureaus. Instead, the health-care system is modelled on the National Health Service in the UK because of Hong Kong's history as a British colony.262\nThe laws and legislations of this system help to ensure access to quality medical care for its residents. According to the Basic Laws of Hong Kong (article 107), the government's expenditure needs to be consistent with the city's GDP growth.263 Article 138 states that the government should develop policies for the development of western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine and the improvement of medical and health services. Furthermore, under the provisions of Section 4d of the Hospital Authority Ordinance (chapter 113), the hospital authority recommends fees for the use of hospital services by the public based on the principle that no person should be prevented, through an absence of means, from obtaining adequate medical treatment. Section 8 of the same ordinance states that the hospital authority might also borrow money, if needed, to meet its obligations or perform its functions.These legal protections have created a relatively equitable system such that health services for most residents in all communities are rarely more than 30 min away from their homes and access to essential health care is given regardless of their ability to pay. To provide an average of 5\u00b72 beds per 1000 residents and other health services, the government owns 42 public hospitals and institutions and employs 6287 doctors and 20 057 registered nurses. However, the maintenance of these standards over the past decade has more than doubled government expenditure on health, with HK$67 430 million being spent in 2016 compared with $30 176 million in 2006. This rise led to a 4% increase in total government expenditure from 14\u00b76% in 2006 to 18\u00b76% in 2016.Hong Kong's strong economy and independent law system are key to the level of health services provided in the city. Given that many cities in China now have a strong economy, other cities should try to secure support for health services through local laws or regulations.",

A series of actions have been implemented to realise these goals. These actions include making community health centres or town (or village) clinics the gatekeepers to specialists and other medical resources and forming a hierarchical structure in different levels of hospitals through strategies like the bi-directional referral system and health insurance policies.265 Another important task is to reduce patients' out-of-pocket expenditure by reforming the revenue system of hospitals and reimbursement procedures.266\n",

To fulfil that mandate, the three types of state-sponsored insurance schemes (Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance, Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance, and new rural cooperative medical system) have been expanded dramatically in China. Findings from consecutive Chinese National Health Services Surveys270 showed that medical insurance coverage has increased from 29\u00b77% of the total population in 2003, to 87\u00b79% in 2008, and 95\u00b77% in 2011 (figure 12\n). Only 17 million urban residents (4\u00b71% of all urban residents at the time) enrolled into a medical insurance programme when they started in 1998.7 By 2016, the number of people enrolled in urban medical insurance programmes had already increased to 743\u00b79 million (93\u00b78% of all urban residents).8 This increased coverage is associated with a substantial increase in health service utilisation and decrease in economic burden; for example, the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance scheme reduced out-of-pocket inpatient expenditure by 64\u00b75% and the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance scheme reduced it by 45\u00b76%.272 As a result, the out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of private expenditure on health declined from 95\u00b76% in 2000 to 72\u00b73% in 2014.273 The national reimbursement ratio, which reflects the average reimbursement level of state-sponsored insurance, increased from 22\u00b74% in 2009 to 26\u00b74% in 2011.274\n",

In 1994, the Ministry of Health worked with WHO to establish a pilot programme that included two urban districts: Jiading district in Shanghai and Dongcheng district in Beijing. In 2007, ten cities and towns were chosen by the Ministry of Health for the expanded pilot programme.284 In 2015, the State Council of China called for building healthy cities in Opinions of the State Council on Further Strengthening the Patriotic Health Work During a New Period, which calls for building healthy cities with Chinese characteristics.285 Then in 2016, after the Healthy China 2030 plan was passed, the National Health and Family Planning Commission expanded the pilot programme and chose 38 cities as the first group to be included in the national programme.Panel 8The concept Healthy CitiesWHO defines a healthy city as \u201cone that is continually developing those public policies and creating those physical and social environments which enable its people to mutually support each other in carrying out all functions of life and achieving their full potential.\u201d281\nWHO's Europe Office suggests that a city can become a healthy city if it adopts a Healthy Cities approach. This approach seeks to improve health in cities through good urban governance that puts health high on the political and social agenda of cities. The Healthy Cities approach recognises the determinants of health and the need to engage all stakeholders to address them; this attitude is supported by a set of core values, including equity, social inclusion, intersectoral management, and community participation. These values explicitly imply that urban health development is everyone's business.282\nIn 2016, the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee of China defined a healthy city as an upgraded version of a hygienic city, stating that \u201cthrough the improvement of urban planning, construction and management, (the city) improves the natural environment, social environment, and health services and popularizes healthy lifestyles to meet residents' health needs and to achieve the coordinated development of urban construction and human health.\u201dThe five main focuses of healthy cities in China are constructing healthy environments, building healthy society, optimising health services, fostering healthy people, and developing healthy culture. The six key tasks include constructing healthy cells (healthy schools, institutions, and communities), establishing health governance models, improving environmental and sanitary infrastructure, enhancing the safety management of drinking water, improving environmental quality, and improving public security systems.283\n",

Both leaders and residents in urban China are not new to this type of social movement thanks to the success of the Hygienic Cities movement. The Healthy Cities project in China has unique features. The participating cities focus on five fields: health service, healthy environment, healthy society, healthy people, and health culture. Municipal governments serve as conveners while different government agencies organise and implement specific projects on the ground. Residents, NGOs, and other social enterprises actively participate in these projects. The Healthy Cities project has been pushed forward by its inclusion in governmental plans and implementation of specific projects. These measures are in contrast with the largely project-driven and non-governmental Healthy Cities project in developed countries.9 The difference is also clear in the evaluation methods of healthy cities. Overlaps on indicators for health and environment can be found by comparing the indicators used in China with those developed by the WHO Europe Healthy Cities Network (appendix); we found that half of the indicators had an overlap. The Chinese system has more comprehensive health indicators and the European system has more environmental indicators. However, the two indicator systems overlap very little on health service and social indicators. Overall, the indicator system used in China focuses more on measuring results and less on measuring actions, policies, and governance.286\n",

The successful use of mass media in health promotion and education is a particular strength of the Healthy Cities project in China (panel 9\n). The pilot programme also helped to improve urban environments. In a paired comparison of 15 healthy cities with 15 non-healthy cities, the programme helped to increase the proportion of urban domestic sewage that was treated by 32%, the proportion of urban domestic garbage treated by 30%, and the proportion of qualified farmer's markets by 40%.287 Common reasons for successful projects include strong leadership of the government, availability of a mechanism for wide participation, and a genuine desire to seek collaboration. Projects that serve the wellbeing of local residents are more likely to succeed if they have the full support of the local governments and health-relevant policies based on local conditions.288 Although actions taken by cities in China are highly diversified and tailored to local conditions, actions are often quickly adopted at the national scale once they are proved effective. For example, free health packages have been given to every household as a way to promote health literacy in many pilot cities since its first use in Shanghai in 2010.Panel 9Wuxi\u2014health education through mass mediaWuxi, a city that is located in Jiangsu province and has 6\u00b75 million people, used mass media effectively to promote health literacy among residents in its efforts to become a healthy city.The city circulates a weekly newspaper that is entirely devoted to health and has 50 000 subscriptions. The city's television stations shot a 60-epsiode sitcom named Health 66 in 2010, which was broadcasted in Wuxi and 12 other cities in Jiangsu province. The Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Wuxi worked with a movie company to produce a six-episode three-dimensional cartoon on smoking control in 2012; the cartoon won the first prize in a national competition for education materials on public health and has been viewed nationwide. In 2016, Wuxi Radio Station broadcasted a 25-min section on healthy lifestyles every Saturday and Sunday. The radio also has a 2 h call-in programme on health knowledge every Sunday. Monday to Friday, the Wuxi television station has a 40-min quiz programme on medical knowledge and a 60-min show named Living up to 100 Years. On Saturday and Sunday, there is a 90-min programme named Zero Distance to Medical Experts. Famous experts from different hospitals are invited to discuss the prevention and treatment for different diseases and answer calls from patients. In addition to its use of mass media, Wuxi city set up a billboard of health information, built a library of at least 300 books about health in every community, and recruited 464 volunteers to promote health education in communities. These efforts have led to a health awareness rate of 85% among urban residents (measured through health administration surverys), which is the highest rate in Jiangsu province.The success of Wuxi's use of mass media is a good example of how the Healthy Cities movement can improve health education and health promotion. The social services sector in the government (culture, propaganda, civil affairs, and sports) works closely with the health sector to share health information on mass media and in every community. The decision and investment by the municipal government to make Wuxi a healthy city provided the political motivation and resources needed for the two sectors to work together. This type of intersectoral collaboration has been widely applied in other Chinese cities.",

First, although cross-sector collaboration has been emphasised in the pilot programme, projects are still primarily restricted to public health system. It is still a challenge to break down traditional barriers between different government agencies and between governments, NGOs, and private enterprises.288 For example, there are some general issues with health education in primary and secondary schools in general, such as a shortage of qualified teachers and materials. The situation is worse in less developed regions compared with more developed ones and is arguably caused by the current arrangement in which the National Health and Family Planning Commission is responsible for health education rather than the Ministry of Education because this arrangement means that health education in China is done primarily through informal education avenues.249 Furthermore, most projects take on soft targets (ie, health promotion) rather than difficult issues, such as improvement of infrastructure and equity. There is a huge discordance between the construction of Healthy Cities and urban planning and development. Finally, assessments on cities focus too much on results rather than progress.9\n",

A population health approach that engages in the ethical and political dimensions of these challenges, recognising their inherent complexity and embracing new approaches to the production of scientific evidence and its translation into policy, will be required to address these problems.291 The Healthy Cities approach has been proposed as a framework that is capable of tackling the complex urban health issues of the 21st century.292\n",

This framework has important implications for the activities of city governments, which will need to consider infrastructural, environmental, and sociocultural determinants, and to create capacity and transparent governance across spatiotemporal scales and sectors.298 Therefore, cities need to take transdisciplinary, interconnected, integrated and inclusive approaches\u2014systems approaches\u2014to deal with complex health challenges.294 The Healthy Cities approach intrinsically includes such a framework.",

Indeed, cities in China are acting across multiple domains (panel 10\n) with key features that include a strong commitment to clean urban environments, diverse approaches to fostering cultures of health and healthy lifestyles, and a wide range of support for the urban poor and disadvantaged. Yet, several important gaps remain with respect to best practices for building global healthy cities, as highlighted by the WHO and UN Habitat.305\nPanel 10Major actions taken by the 36 cities in China to build healthy citiesActions are in decreasing order by the number of times they were reported.\nGovernance\n\n\u2022Form a working team in the municipal government\u2022Integrate health into the development plan\u2022Evaluate performance of participants\u2022Enforce existing laws and regulations\u2022Set aside budgets for building healthy cities\u2022Conduct baseline survey of health in the city\u2022Set up a special office dedicated to the building of the healthy city\u2022Assess progress regularly\n\nHealthy environment\n\n\u2022Control emissions of air pollutants\u2022Control water pollution\u2022Improve infrastructure and facilities\u2022Afforestation and greening\u2022Garbage collection, recycling, sorting, and burning\u2022Industry transition to low-emission technology\u2022Expand public transit systems\u2022Use clean energy\u2022Enhance environmental monitoring\u2022Introduce the market mechanism into pollution control\u2022Optimise urban planning and design\n\nHealthy society\n\n\u2022Expand health insurance coverage and improve reimbursement rates\u2022Increase the number of people eligible for social welfare and provide financial assistance to people in need (people who are poor, handicapped, mentally diseased, homeless, or have lost their only child)\u2022Strengthen care for elderly people\u2022Increase education equity\u2022Encourage social groups and volunteers to get involved\u2022Enhance public safety of the city\u2022Create jobs\u2022Provide housing assistance to low-income families\u2022Mediate interpersonal conflicts\n\nHealth service\n\n\u2022Build a hierarchical structure for the health-care system\u2022Invest in health-care facilities and personnel\u2022Reduce medical costs and out-of-pocket expenditure for patients\u2022Strengthen primary health care (family doctors, general practitioners, and community health centers)\u2022Enhance public health management\u2022Control chronic diseases\u2022Control infectious diseases\u2022Control mental diseases\u2022Provide health services to migrants\u2022Adopt modern technologies in health management, such as electronic health archives, telemedicine, mobile health, smart medicine, big data, telemedicine, and health information data centers\u2022Increase the use of traditional Chinese medicine\u2022Encourage investment in health care from private sectors\u2022Develop health industry (medical centers, pharmaceutical industry, and nursing homes)\n\nHealthy people\n\n\u2022Promote an active lifestyle\u2022Strengthen health services for women and children\u2022Monitor physical status of the general public\u2022Cultivate health culture: controlled smoking and drinking and healthy diet\n\nHealth culture\n\n\u2022Health education through mass media\u2022Health education through the school system\u2022Health information through internet and mobile platforms\u2022Produce publications of health information\u2022Health promotion in public spaces (advertisements and billboards)\u2022Build health information centres in communities\u2022Organise events and competitions to promote health literacy\u2022Disseminate health information through doctors and experts\u2022Engage private sectors to cultivate a healthy culture\n",

Although most cities in China specify various goals and metrics (eg, targets for pollution control, urban renewal, social welfare, and health care), the overall effect of these practices on urban health is rarely assessed and equity analysis is rarer still. Only a small number of surveyed cities had conducted a baseline population health survey; the absence of such activities will make it more difficult to assess the overall progress of urban development policies and programmes. Moreover, the survey also shows that uneven development is constraining progress. Although highly developed cities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou) can address individual health needs and the social roots of health problems, cities in less developed zones (such as central and west China) still struggle to provide basic public services, such as garbage collection, public toilets, and basic medical services. It is very unlikely that these two types of cities can be fruitfully assessed with the same set of indicators.",

This situation is win-win because improvements in health can benefit businesses through reduced health-care expenditures, increased revenue, and improved reputation. Although, in some cities, privately-owned businesses have been involved in health promotion campaigns, the scale of such programmes is limited and is essentially based on voluntary participation. Therefore, there is substantial room for expansion. The private sector can also contribute to promoting healthy behaviour among customers or consumers more broadly. For example, a recent collaboration between the public health agency and a restaurant chain in Beijing aimed to cut salt content in food, benefiting customers and boosting the image of the company as health-conscious (panel 11\n).Panel 11Xicheng district, Beijing\u2014engage the private sector to promote healthy dietQingfeng Steamed Stuffed Buns Restaurant is a restaurant chain that is famous for its Beijing local food, especially steamed stuffed buns. The restaurant became even more popular after President Xi Jinping paid an unexpected visit to one of its stores and ordered a plate of famous buns for lunch in 2013. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xicheng district started to work with the Qingfeng restaurant chain to reduce the use of salt in its buns in 2013. After experiments to find a recipe that decreased salt content by 10% but did not compromise the taste, Qingfeng began to sell a low-salt version of steamed buns stuffed with shredded seafood in 2013. In 2015, Qingfeng added another low-salt version of steamed buns stuffed with bamboo shoots and sauced pork. Both dishes have sold better than the regular versions. In 2015, 235 Qingfeng stores in Beijing started to offer free low-salt buns to selected elderly people. Qingfeng also use in-store advertisements, WeChat, and the company website to promote reduced salt consumption to their customers.To build on the success of Qingfeng, Huatian Catering Group\u2014which owns Qingfeng\u2014now works with public health specialists to promote low-salt, low-oil, and low-sugar food in all its restaurants. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xicheng joined forces with the Association of Catering Business in Xicheng to promote healthy restaurant foods. So far, 35 restaurants and cafeterias have been certified for their provision of healthy foods.Collaborations between restaurants and public health agencies in China are facilitated by the power of public agencies to issue health permits to restaurants. However, in this case, the public health agency in Xicheng district went beyond its role as an administrator and helped restaurants to develop healthy food. There are many other ways in which public health agencies in China can use upstream preventions and interventions rather than focusing on downstream interventions.",

This characterisation contributes to misunderstanding of the health consequences of actions in other sectors. A short-term vision for decision making can add to this problem.

There are scarce incentives for non-health sector agencies to contribute and changes in leadership often make it difficult to maintain intersectoral actions on health. To be successful in the pursuit of intersectoral actions health, cities in China need to recognise the necessity of whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches.325 For example, cites need to break the barrier of information sharing among different government sectors (panel 12\n). This recognition then needs to cause institutional changes to facilitate intersectoral collaboration, including formal mechanisms to ensure their long-term sustainability. Finally, cities should provide incentives for intersectoral collaboration.Panel 12Yichang\u2014break the barrier to information sharing among different sectorsYichang is a city in Hubei province. As of 2015, there are 1\u00b728 million registered residents in its urban districts. The city started to manage its five urban districts using a grid system in December, 2010. The 112 urban neighbourhoods were divided into 1421 grids, with each grid containing about 200\u2013300 households. Grids are monitored by full-time staff who are responsible for reporting anything that happens in their grid directly to the city information hub through a specialised mobile application. The information hub is linked to different databases in more than 30 departments and offices in the municipal government. All relevant databases are updated once new information comes in.The Health Management Analysis Center is a component of the hub that started to collect health data in 2015. It has connections to 173 health-care facilities and 368 pharmacies. So far, the centre has built 1\u00b73 million copies of electronic archives that, in real-time, collect patients' health information, including physical exam records, X-ray images, prescriptions, and other health and medical information. Because the centre is linked to databases managed by the Public Security Department and the Urban Housing and Construction Department through the hub, it can trace each person to his or her home. This feature has been very helpful in the prevention and control of diseases and the allocation of medical resources. The 1421 grid monitor staff help the centre to collect health information (such as mental disorders and emergencies) as it occurs in the grid on a real-time basis and conduct specific surveys on topics, such as health insurance coverage.The successful information sharing among different sectors in Yichang can be attributed to the commitment of city leaders to information technology, its centralised political system, and its relatively small population size. The grid system and the real-time information sharing from health-care facilities and pharmacies ensures that there are no gaps in health information at sub-city levels. Although this approach has merits, there are concerns about privacy issues and the safety of personal information. There is an urgent need for laws and regulations that clearly define the boundary and responsibility of the government, health services, and any other third-party entities on the collection and use of personal health information in China.",

This arrangement makes sense when health is narrowly defined as access to medical or public health services and quality of care, since the local health family and planning commission is responsible for these functions. However, the need for intersectoral actions in building healthy cities renders such arrangements obsolete; the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee office, when subsumed within the health family and planning commission, does not have the required authority to coordinate multi-sectoral action for health. To resolve this, responsibility for the administration of the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee should be transferred from the local health family and planning commission to the mayor's office. More importantly, the committee should review major policies and plans for urban development and management, conduct formal assessments of the health effects where appropriate, and decide whether candidate policies and projects should be revised to reduce long-term negative effects on health.",

As a starting point, we suggest a system based on three indicators: life expectancy, premature death rate from chronic diseases, and a composite index derived from the WHO HEART tool. The first two are included in the Healthy China 2030 targets and reflect the status of health and of the health-care system, respectively, in metrics that are easy to understand. Both indicators are monitored regularly by the Disease Surveillance Points System so no extra effort will be required. The third indicator reflects the status of health inequity. Since health for all is a guiding principle in the Healthy China 2030 plan and an international focus, it is key that progress in this area be measured. Most indicators in the WHO HEART tool are also used in the indicator system for healthy cities in China and should therefore be easy to attain.

Monitoring networks are urgently needed in cities to provide timely and accurate information on the status of urban environments and resident health. Strengthened government-operated monitoring networks should be complemented by collaboration with private companies on big-data technologies. For example, diseases in cities can in some cases be tracked using internet query data, which was the case for hand, foot, and mouth disease in Chengdu (figure 14\n, appendix).

In addition, more systematic measurement and assessment of all dimensions of urban health on local, regional, and global scales would provide unbiased data for forecast models and support evidence-based policy making.

Urban planning elements as diverse as housing, transportation, information technology development, and land use can affect health through their influence on food access, physical activity, housing quality, health information, access to care, transport choice and affordability, school locations, social equity, clean air and water, and other factors.330 Therefore, a multi-scale, cross-sectoral vision of urban health should be built into city and regional planning programmes to ensure that urban planners are fully aware of the various elements required for a healthy city. If health cannot be given proper consideration in the design and planning of districts, communities, individual buildings, and urban infrastructural elements (such as roads), the healthy functioning of an entire city is unlikely to be achieved. A healthy city should also have the capacity to shield its citizens from potential health risks.

In the words of Jaime Lerner, \u201ccities are not the problem; cities are the solution\u201d.329, 331 Four decades ago, as a result of health innovations like barefoot doctors and community health care centres, China improved the health of millions of rural dwellers, thus providing the world with a model for good health at low cost.332 Today, the drive to develop healthy cities in China and create the world's first ecocivilisation is set in the context of an unprecedented global push for sustainable development, in the form of the Sustainable Development Goals and the paradigm-shifting idea of planetary health. These powerful ideas reinforce and support one another and give us confidence that cities in China can face the aforementioned challenges and once again lead the world in securing sustainable health for all.",
