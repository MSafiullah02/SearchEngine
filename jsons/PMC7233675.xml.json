This would also improve institutional resources, as a prior survey found that, on average, over US$8000 is spent by the host program in hard costs.13 Additionally, residency programs would be less disrupted by interviewing residents who miss an average of 1 week to 10 days for fellowship interviews and associated travel.11,12",

            "text": "Nevertheless, this current time period necessitating virtual experiences is a rich opportunity for programs to improve upon fellowship recruitment processes and possibly even how to integrate virtual interviewing into residency recruitment in the future given the improvements in cost, time, and efficiency. Thus, our lessons learned and recommendations for surgical fellowship programs include the following.Hold a mock interview day to identify issues related to connectivity and to anticipate questions from faculty members who may be unfamiliar with the videoconference interface and need practice with the technology.Design multiple methods for applicants to learn about the program. Examples include adding content to existing websites, narrating videos or podcasts, and organizing an informal night before \u2018happy hour\u2019 with fellows and videoconference open forums during the interview day.Applicants appreciate contact with faculty and fellows in individual and group settings. Consider holding a structured introductory session at the beginning of the interview day and include an optional end-of-the-day group question and answer session with faculty, fellows, and other applicants.Applicants are interested in the unique physical elements of an institution and its location. Video or live streaming hospital tours may enhance the virtual interview experience.Implement virtual interview forms for data collection to electronically collate information.Continue to study the virtual interview process to further streamline processes and optimize how applicants can convey to programs their desired best impressions.",
