            "text": "The newly identified Coronavirus pneumonia, subsequently termed COVID-19, is highly transmittable and pathogenic with no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available for treatment. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress to a severe form of pneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. While medical imaging is not currently recommended in Canada for primary diagnosis of COVID-19, computer-aided diagnosis systems could assist in the early detection of COVID-19 abnormalities and help to monitor the progression of the disease, potentially reduce mortality rates. In this study, we compare popular deep learning-based feature extraction frameworks for automatic COVID-19 classification. To obtain the most accurate feature, which is an essential component of learning, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, ResNet, InceptionV3, InceptionRes-NetV2, VGGNet, NASNet were chosen amongst a pool of deep convolutional neural networks. The extracted features were then fed into several machine learning classifiers to classify subjects as either a case of COVID-19 or a control. This approach avoided task-specific data pre-processing methods to support a better generalization ability for unseen data. The performance of the proposed method was validated on a publicly available COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray and CT images. The DenseNet121 feature extractor with Bagging tree classifier achieved the best performance with 99% classification accuracy. The second-best learner was a hybrid of the a ResNet50 feature extractor trained by LightGBM with an accuracy of 98%.",

Once input images are prepared, we fed them into the feature extraction phase with the state-of-the-art CNN descriptors to extract deep features from each input image.

Aiming to tackle these challenges, studies in a variety computer vision tasks demonstrated the advantages of transfer learning strategies from an auxiliary domain in improving the detection rate and performance of a classifier [34] [35] [36] . In a transfer learning strategy, we transfer the weights already learned on a cross-domain dataset into the current deep learning task instead of training a model from scratch. With the transfer learning strategy, the deep CNN can obtain general features from the source dataset that cannot be learned due to the limited size of the dataset in the current task. Transfer learning strategies have various advantages, such as avoiding the overfitting issue when the number of training samples is limited, reducing the computational resources, and also speeding up the convergence of the network [37] [38].",

            "text": "Effective feature extraction is one of the most important steps toward learning rich and informative representations from raw input data to provide accurate and robust results. The small or imbalanced size of the training samples poses a significant challenge for the training of a deep CNN where data dimensionality is much larger than the number of samples leading to over-fitting. Although various strategies, e.g. data augmentation [39] , transfer learning [40] and fine-tuning [41] , may reduce the problem of insufficient or imbalance training data, the detection rate of the CNN model may degrade due to the over-fitting issue. Since the overall performance obtained by a fine-tuning method in the initial experiments for this study was not significant, we employed a different approach inspired by [25] [26] [27] known as deep convolutional feature representation. In this method, we used pre-trained well-established CNN models as a visual feature extractor to encode the input images into a feature vector of sparse descriptors of low dimensionality. Then the computed encoded feature vectors produced by CNN architectures are fed into different classifiers, i.e. machine learning algorithms, to yield the final prediction. This lower dimension vector significantly reduces the risk of over-fitting and also the training time. Different robust CNN architectures such as MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet, VGGNet, NASNet are selected for feature extraction with the possibility of transfer learning advantage for limited datasets and also their satisfying performances in different computer vision tasks [42, 43, 44, 45] .

Medical imaging is also playing a critical in monitoring the progression of the disease and patient care. Extracting features from radiology modalities is an essential step in training machine learning models since the model performance directly depends on the quality of extracted features. Motivated by the success of deep learning models in computer vision, the focus of this research is to provide an extensive comprehensive study on the classification of COVID-19 pneumonia in chest X-ray and CT imaging using features extracted by the stateof-the-art deep CNN architectures and trained on machine learning algorithms. The 10-fold cross-validation technique was adopted to evaluate the average generalization performance of the classifiers in each experiment. For all CNNs, the network weights were initialized from the weights trained on ImageNet. The Windows based computer system used for this work had an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700K 3.7 GHz processors with 32 GB RAM. The training and testing process of the proposed architecture for this experiment was implemented in Python using Keras package with Tensorflow backend as the deep learning framework backend and run on Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB RAM. Table 1 and Figure 5 summarize the accuracy performance of six machine learning algorithms, namely, DT, RF, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Bagging classifier and LightGBM on the feature extracted by deep CNNs. Each entry in Table 1 , is in the format (\u00b5 \u00b1 \u03c3) where \u00b5 is the average classification accuracy and \u03c3 is standard deviation. Analyzing Table 1 the topmost result was obtained by Bagging classifier with a maximum of 99.00% \u00b1 0.09 accuracy on features extracted by DesnseNet121 architecture (with feature extraction time of 9.306 seconds and training time of 30.748 seconds in Table 5 ), which is the highest result reported in the literature for COVID-19 classification of this dataset. It is also inferred from Table 1 that the second-best result obtained by ResNet50 feature extractor and LightGBM classifier (with feature extraction time of 0.960 seconds and training time of 10.206 seconds in Table 5 ) with an overall accuracy of 98.00 \u00b1 0.09. Comparing the first and second winners among all combinations, the classification accuracy of DenseNet121 with Bagging is slightly better (1%) than ResNet50 with LightGBM, while the training time of the second winner is tempting, almost 30 times better than the first winner in terms of accuracy. Although Bagging is a slow learner, it has the lowest standard deviation and hence is more stable than other learners. The results also demonstrate that the detection rate is worst on the features extracted by ResNet101V2 trained by the AdaBoost classifier with 76.00 \u00b1 0.32 accuracy. Figure 5 and Figure 6 demonstrate box-plot distributions of deep CNNs feature extractors and classification accuracy from the 10-fold cross-validation. Circles in Figure 5 represent outliers. In Tables 2, 3  Table 4 : Comparison of classification f1-score metric of different machine learning models.

Some examples of these cases are illustrated in Figure 7 . Finally, comparison of the feature extraction time using deep CNN models and training with ML algorithms are shown in Table 5 and After training a model, the pre-trained weights and models can be used as predictive engine for CAD systems to allow an automatic classification of new data. A web-based application was implemented using standard web development tools and techniques such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and Flask web framework. Figure 9 shows the output of our web-based application for COVID-19 pneumonia detection. This web application could help doctors benefit from our proposed method by providing an online tool that only requires uploading an X-ray or CT image. The application then provides the physician with a simple COVID-19 Positive, or COVID-19 Negative observation. It should be noted that this application has yet to be clinically validated, is not yet approved for diagnostic use and would simply serve as a diagnostic aid for the medical imaging specialist. The proposed method is generic as it does not need handcrafted features and can be easily adapted, requiring minimal pre-processing. The provided dataset is collected across multiple sources with different shape, textures and morphological characteristics. The transfer learning strategy has successfully transferred knowledge from the source to the target domain despite the limited dataset size of the provided dataset. During the proposed approach, we observed that no overfitting occurs to impact the classification accuracy adversely. However, our study has some limitations. The training data samples are limited. Extending the dataset size by additional data sources can provide a better understanding on the proposed approach. Also, employing pre-trained networks as feature extractors requires to rescale the input images to a certain dimension which may discard valuable information. Although the proposed methodology achieved satisfying performance with an accuracy of 99.00%, the diagnostic performance of the deep learning visual feature extractor and machine learning classifier should be evaluated on real clinical study trials.",

As of the time of this writing, there is no clinically approved therapeutic drug or vaccine available to treat COVID-19. Early detection of COVID-19 is important to interrupt the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 and patient care. Currently, the isolation and quarantine of the suspicious patients is the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Diagnostic modalities such as chest Xray and CT are playing an important role in monitoring the progression and severity of the disease in COVID-19 positive patients. This paper presents a feature extractor-based deep learning and machine learning classifier approach for computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Several ML algorithms were trained on the features extracted by well-established CNNs architectures to find the best combination of features and learners. Considering the high visual complexity of image data, proper deep feature extraction is considered as a critical step in developing deep CNN models. The experimental results on available chest X-ray and CT dataset demonstrate that the features extracted by DesnseNet121 architecture and trained by a Bagging tree classifier generates very accurate prediction of 99.00% in terms of classification accuracy.",
