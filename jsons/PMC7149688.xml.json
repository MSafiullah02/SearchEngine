            "text": "Both expressed and synthetic RNAi activators have been utilized successfully against various viral infections. Considerable effort has gone into ensuring good specificity and potency of the silencers against their viral cognates. Use of Pol III promoters to transcribe RNA that forms short hairpin RNA (shRNA) structures, which mimic precursor microRNAs (pre-miRs), has been particularly popular. However, demonstration that overexpression of HBV-targeting shRNAs could result in fatal toxicity in mice was an important caveat to researchers in the field [7]. Since this observation, various configurations of expressed RNAi activators have been engineered to improve control of production of the antivirals. Using antiviral mimics of primary microRNAs (pri-miRs) has shown promise against HBV [8], [9], HCV [10], and HIV-1 [11], [12]. These RNAi activators may be transcribed from inducible and tissue-specific Pol II promoters. The artificial pri-miRs have been multimerized to result in combinatorial silencing that improves efficacy and provides a greater barrier to viral escape. As mimics of early intermediates of the RNAi pathway, functional coupling of processing of the pri-miR mimics to downstream steps of the pathway is thought to improve potency. Better silencing by antivirals allows for use of lower doses of the candidate therapeutics and diminished off-target effects. Developments with use of synthetic RNAi activators have also been impressive. Typically, synthetic RNAi activators comprise short complementary strands of RNA that constitute short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Various chemical modifications have been used to augment silencing, diminish immunostimulation, and stabilize the gene silencers. Synthetic procedures are also adaptable for other purposes. One interesting application is the coupling of targeting aptamers to synthetic siRNAs, which enables specific delivery to virus-infected cells [13], [14], [15], [16]. Availability of new methods for bioinformatic analysis has also been important to advance RNAi-based antiviral therapy. Because only the seed region of the guide strand of a potentially therapeutic siRNA is required to effect translational silencing [17], the likelihood of nonspecific inhibition of cellular targets may be high. However, availability of vast sequence databases and analytical algorithms have allowed for the design of antiviral RNAi activators that have minimal interaction with off-target sites.",

In addition, adapting the silencing strategies to attain the inhibition that is required for a curative effect is important. These considerations are illustrated by the example of development of RNAi-based therapy for treatment of persistent HBV infection. A clinical trial is in progress for the use of nonviral formulations containing synthetic RNAi activators to treat HBV infection (http://www.arrowheadresearch.com/programs-overview). Suppression of viral replication that is better or as good as that of licensed drugs needs to be demonstrated. In addition, because the gene silencing mechanism is not permanent, ability of the treatment to achieve a durable effect that leads to curative elimination of all viral replication intermediates will be important. Transient RNAi-based silencing may be better suited to treatment of RNA viruses that do not have a stable DNA replication intermediate.",

To effect mutagenesis, engineered sequence-specific DNA-targeting proteins have been coupled to nucleases. Repeated cleavage followed by cellular error-prone nonhomologous end joining results in mutagenesis at the intended target. Earliest studies showing feasibility of gene editing used derivatives of zinc finger proteins (ZFPs). Twenty years ago, the approach was shown to inhibit expression of the bcr-abl sequence that is generated after the chromosomal translocation that characterizes chronic myeloid leukemia [18]. The inhibitory effect resulted from binding of the engineered ZFPs to DNA and physical disruption of transcription of the bcr-abl sequence.",

Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are typically generated by fusing DNA-binding domains with the nuclease from the type IIS restriction endonuclease, FokI, which cuts one strand of a DNA duplex. Therefore, complete ZFNs comprise dimers, and each of the units is designed to cleave complementary strands at an intended target. Although engineered ZFNs have been the subject of many years of study, application of the technology is complicated by variability in the efficiency of target binding and cleavage. Homing endonucleases (HEs), also known as meganucleases, may cause sequence-specific cleavage of viral targets, but engineering this class of nuclease is fraught with technical difficulties. Problems associated with the dual functions of target binding and DNA cleavage of domains of the HEs are constraining.",

As an alternative to engineering nucleases, sequence-specific transcriptional repressors may well find favor for therapeutic inhibition of viral gene expression. The Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) is capable of inducing epigenetic changes at specific sequences of DNA to cause long-term transcriptional suppression.

Moreover, in the case of ZFNs and TALENs, two cassettes are required to produce the two monomers that make up the dimeric nucleases. Likewise, typical engineered CRISPR/Cas systems comprise two cassettes: one encodes the nuclease enzyme and the other the guide RNA. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, popular gene therapy vectors, have a limited capacity for accommodating transgenes. Therefore, complete dimeric nucleases may only be constituted by transduction of cells with two vectors, each expressing one of the monomers. An alternative to this complicated delivery approach is use of nonviral vectors (NVVs) to deliver mRNA encoding the gene editors\u2019 subunits.

Once a target has been altered by introduction of mutations, a gene editing nuclease is no longer required. In fact, persistence of the effector is undesirable because the risk for off-target effects is increased. This feature is well suited to using NVVs to deliver nuclease-encoding mRNAs. Durability of gene editing that involves use of targeted transcriptional repressors, such as KRAB, to introduce epigenetic inhibitory effects is not yet well characterized. Transient expression of such repressors may be sufficient to cause the intended durable therapeutic inhibition. Avoiding unwanted effects on the host genome may be particularly useful for treatment of chronic HBV infection with transcriptional repressors. In individuals who are carriers of the virus, HBV DNA is often integrated into the hepatocyte genomes, and nuclease-mediated digestion may induce chromosomal translocations to cause unintended side effects.",

Location of the virus-infected cells is pertinent to devising the appropriate method of delivering the therapeutics. For example, systemic administration of antivirals may be necessary to disable HBV genes in the liver. However, for treatment of respiratory infections, administration of the therapeutic formulations to the airways is usually more effective. The two main types of delivery vehicles, viral vectors and NVVs, have been discussed in detail in Chapters 4 and 5Chapter 4Chapter 5. Each has particular features that are suited to specific applications to antiviral gene therapy. Viral vectors are efficient carriers of sequences encoding expression cassettes, whereas delivery in vivo of expression cassettes with NVV formulations is usually modest. Because viruses essentially exist as nucleic acids parasites, they have evolved efficient mechanisms of cellular delivery of the nucleic acids, and this property has been exploited to generate viral vectors. Although recombinant viruses are highly capable vectors, they have drawbacks of high costs of production, difficulties with regulating the dose of therapeutics, induction of mutations in transduced cells, and eliciting neutralizing and potentially toxic immunostimulation. Durable expression, particularly by recombinant lentiviral vectors, is useful to achieve sustained antiviral effects, but utility of these vectors for antiviral application is narrow. RNA-based antivirals are growing in popularity, and NVVs are the preferred vectors for delivery of these nucleic acids. Because NVVs do not readily cross the nuclear membrane, the cytoplasmic site of action of antiviral RNAs, which include synthetic siRNAs and mRNAs, is a convenient feature. Various NVVs are under development, and these include lipoplex formulations and polymer conjugates. Because they are based on use of synthetic compounds, NVVs may be prepared on the large scale that is required for clinical application. Moreover, RNA-containing nonviral formulations are appealing because of their limited immunostimulation and avoidance of the mutagenic effects of DNA.",

            "text": "Predicting the long-term role of gene therapy for viral infections is difficult. Apart from the many technical challenges, there are additional factors that will influence the future general use of antiviral gene therapy. When alternative treatment or prevention of a viral infection is effective and easily administered, the importance of antiviral gene therapy may be diminished. An example of such a case could play out with developments in the treatment of HCV infection. Recent progress in HCV therapy using small molecules has been very impressive. The newly licensed combination drug, Harvoni\u2122, produced by Gilead, is rapidly effective against HCV genotype 1 (http://www.gilead.com/news/press-releases/2014). Harvoni contains inhibitors of NS5A and NS5B proteins of HCV, and its administration to patients avoids the need for including interferon-\u03b1 in the regimen. With successful implementation of the new HCV treatments, and if the management becomes widely affordable, the importance of gene therapy for HCV infection may diminish. Miravirsen, a modified oligonucleotide that is antisense to miR-122, has shown good efficacy in clinical trials [2]. Licensing and general use of this candidate host factor-disabling nucleic acid is likely to depend on its economical production and achieving antiviral efficacy that is at least as good as the recently licensed anti-HCV agents. Nevertheless, gene therapy will continue to be important for treating serious infections when cure using other approaches is not possible. Eliminating HBV and HIV-1 are examples where gene therapy is likely to play a role in curing the infections. In the case of chronic HBV infection, persistence of the stable covalently closed circular DNA is unaffected by existing therapies, and the gene editing approach potentially provides the means to disable this intractable viral transcription template. Likewise, use of gene editing to inactivate proviral sequences of HIV-1 or to render CD4+ T cells resistant to infection with the virus should be useful to cure HIV-1 infection.",

Infection with viruses that are causes of serious health problems, such as HIV-1, HBV, and Ebola virus, often occurs in financially impoverished communities. Gene therapy formulations are complicated and expensive to prepare, and it is unlikely that the necessary financial resources are currently available in many of the countries where the infections have the most serious effects. Likewise, gene therapy-based methods may be difficult to execute and require a high level of expertise to implement. An example is the procedures involved with modification of autologous progenitors of CD4+ T cells ex vivo, their selection, and then re-infusion into patients to confer resistance to HIV-1 (Chapter 8). The technology is highly specialized, and a lack of expertise would limit access in some of the communities where treatment of HIV-1 infection is most needed. With improvements in methodologies and advancement of new technologies, it is expected that costs will diminish and procedures for performing gene therapy may become simpler. Ideally, this should result in future broader access of the technology to disadvantaged patients.",

            "text": "A major advantage of gene therapy is the ability to develop the antiviral agents based on application of what are becoming simple rational design principles. This is the case for antiviral gene therapies that harness RNAi-based silencing, antisense oligonucleotides, and gene editing. On the basis of knowledge of the sequences of the targets, it is theoretically possible to develop generic methods that enable very rapid design of antiviral nucleic acids. Therefore, the speed with which gene therapy could be developed against an emerging pathogen is an advantage over use of small-molecule drugs to treat these viral infections. Identifying effective small molecule antivirals is also guided by rational design, but it typically requires detailed structural analysis of viral protein targets and empirical testing with optimization before use as therapy.",

This will be important to facilitate implementation of more effective therapeutic measures to address the serious health challenges posed by existing and emergent pathogens. Availability of suitable tools will enable countermeasures to be put into place, which in turn will be important to deal with outbreaks of infections such as caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus during 2002/2003 and infection with Ebola virus. Gene therapy for viral infections is currently poised at an exciting phase. There have been significant successes, and realization of the full potential of the powerful technology is tantalizingly close. Significant goals are likely to be met in the near future, which in turn will influence the direction of the field.",
