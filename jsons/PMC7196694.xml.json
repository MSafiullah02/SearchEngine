An increase in face velocity will increase the penetration within the MPPS range.(3) Flow pattern can also affect penetration. A normal breathing rate approximated by a cyclic sinusoidal flow rate though a respirator filter will result in a higher particulate penetration than a constant flow equivalent based on minute volume.(12) Additionally, peak flow rates measured during exhaustive work can exceed the 85 L/min NIOSH certification flow.(14) A high breathing rate and particles sized within the MPPS range may result in aerosol penetration exceeding that associated with the stated certification level.",

For a given aerodynamic diameter, rod-shaped bacteria with a larger aspect ratio (length to width) were generally collected more effectively on filter media than bacteria with a low aspect ratio (round).(22) The certification challenge aerosol has a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of approximately 300 nm and is closer to a sphere in shape and sized smaller than most bacterial aerosols.

Studies have shown higher penetration of particles sized within the unagglomerated viral size range,(10\u201312,23) compared to larger particles, but less is known about how much of the penetration is made up of viable viruses. A study by Balazy et al.(23) measured the total size-dependent penetration of a MS2 bacteriophage virus (MS2 virus) aerosol through N95 FFRs and surgical masks at a constant 85 L/min flow with a Wide-range Particle Sizer (WPS, MSP Inc., Minn.). The particle sizer counted and sized each particle in small intervals from 10 to 80 nm. Although particles were detected within each size range, the most counts were within the 30 nm interval when measuring the challenge aerosol. The authors speculated that the disperse aerosol was likely made up of agglomerates of cell fragments and viable cells. At the MPPS, approximately 50 nm, one of the N95 filters tested exceeded 5%. The authors concluded that NIOSH-certified FFRs may not provide the expected protection against viral aerosols. Although higher particulate penetration levels than expected were detected, the penetration may have been viral fragments or inert salts from the nebulized liquid suspension medium and not viable viral particles.",

The MS2 physical filtration performance was found to be equivalent to that of NaCl for all FFR models tested. However, the viable MS2 penetration values for the conventional N95 and P100 FFRs (those without an antimicrobial treatment) were found to be less than the MS2 physical penetration measurements. The authors attributed the apparent discrepancy to intrinsic experimental variability associated with the viable MS2 measurement methods. They also noted that the nebulizer solution contained spent growth media, nutrients, and other particles along with the MS2 viruses producing a polydisperse aerosol ranging from 10 to 407 nm. In another study, Wen et al.(26) measured the viable penetration of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) equivalent full-facepiece respirator filter cartridges using a polydisperse phage f2 surrogate viral aerosol with a geometric mean size of 765 nm.

A recent study by Zuo et al.,(27) however, investigated both the physical and viable penetration of N95 FFRs using actual pathogenic viruses. The authors used human adenovirus serotype 1 and swine influenza H3N2 virus (SIV) for the test aerosols. The FFRs were tested at a constant flow rate of 85 L/min. The size distribution of both bioaerosols was similar and polydisperse with a CMD of approximately 50 nm. The physical penetration of the virus aerosols was found to be between 2 and 5%. The infectivity (viable) penetration of the adenovirus was found to be two orders of magnitude lower than physical penetration, leading the authors to conclude that the latter measurement provides a more conservative estimate for respirator performance.",

Thus, both types were included in the study. The FFRs and cartridges were obtained from several manufacturers to provide a range of selections. The FFRs and cartridges were tested as-received. The environmental conditions during testing were maintained at ambient temperature (25 \u00b1 3\u00b0C) and relative humidity (40 \u00b1 10%). Tests were performed at two constant and two cyclic flow rates. The constant flow rates were 85 and 270 L/min. The cyclic sinusoidal flow conditions had minute volumes (volume of air inhaled in one minute during breathing cycle) of 85 (37 breaths/min\u20132.3 L tidal volume) and 135 L/min (44 breaths/min\u20133.1 L tidal volume). The 85 L/min constant flow matched the NIOSH certification flow rate and the minute volume flow of the 85 L/min cyclic flow condition. In addition to the minute flow, the sinusoidal cyclic flows have peak and mean inhalation flows.\n",

These flows represent extreme conditions that will not likely be encountered while wearing these types of filters.

The 50 nm inert aerosol was selected since it is within the MPPS for N95 filters and is reasonably close in size to the NaCl test aerosol used by NIOSH to certify particulate respirators.(7) Only the N95 filters were used for comparison, since the P100 filters were generally very efficient against the MS2 aerosol. Penetration of the 50 nm salt particles was higher than that of the MS2 aerosol for every filter and flow rate combination, ranging from a factor of two to (most typically) over ten times higher penetration. This finding is expected since the larger MS2 particle size produced in this study would exhibit less penetration compared to bioaerosol or inert challenges in the MPPS range. Generally, the viable penetration values were similar to the 0.7 and 1.3 \u03bcm salt penetrations measured in Eshbaugh et al.(12) which is more consistent with the measured MS2 aerosol distribution used in this research.\n\n",

The increased penetration with increased flow is in agreement with the literature.(3,28) The measured constant 85 L/min viable penetration was less than the cyclic 85 L/min penetration. This is consistent with the constant-cyclic flow comparisons for inert particle penetrations in Eshbaugh et al.(12) and Haruta et al.(28) Eshbaugh et al.(12) concluded that the penetration measured at the constant flow equivalent to the cyclic MIF or PIF more closely resembled the penetration measured at the cyclic flow. Haruta et al.(28) demonstrated that penetrations measured at a cyclic flow of 85 L/min and the constant flow equivalent to the cyclic MIF were similar. In this study, a relationship between the cyclic flows and the equivalent constant MIF or PIF flow was not observed.",

Although the transformed data were not normal, the deviations from normal were relatively moderate and occurred at the extremes of the distribution. As a result, the departures from normality were not expected to affect the outcome of the ANOVA. As expected, particle type/size, filter, and flow rate/type were all statistically significant factors (p < 0.05). Since particle type/size was significant, it confirmed the observations that the viable aerosol penetrated less than the inert MPPS aerosol.",

The risk of occupational exposure to monodisperse bioaerosols within the MPPS, however, is expected to be low since the vast majority (>95 percent) of infectious virus-laden airborne particles are likely to be greater than 100 nm, based on measurements taken in a hospital setting.(6) Eninger et al.(31) tested the performance of N99 and N95 FFRs against an inert salt aerosol (NaCl) and three virus aerosols (MS2, T4, and Bacillus subtilis phage). All the aerosols had a large fraction of particles in the ultrafine range (\u223c20 to 500 nm). The filter penetration of the bioaerosols did not exceed that of inert NaCl aerosol, suggesting that inert test aerosols are suitable for predicting filter penetration of similarly sized viruses.",

It is therefore difficult to directly compare the results from this study to other studies that produced MS2 aerosols having significantly different particle size characteristics. Furthermore, filtration studies conducted using different microorganisms, bioaerosol dissemination methods, and test conditions (e.g., flow rates or relative humidity) would be expected to yield different penetration results. The findings from this study suggest that testing with inert aerosols in the MPPS range provides a very conservative estimate of respirator filtration efficiency against larger naturally occurring bioaerosols. NIOSH uses a mass-based penetration measurement which cannot be directly compared to the count-based penetration measurement used in this study. The count-based penetrations presented throughout this study, therefore, do not indicate a pass (or fail) of the NIOSH certification tests.",

The majority of aerosol penetration occurs at the face seal interface and not through the filter material.(32) All masks need to provide a reasonable leak-tight face seal for optimum protection. For regulation of workplace respiratory protection programs, OSHA gives all FFRs and elastomeric half-mask respirators an assigned protection factor (APF) of 10 regardless of filter type (i.e., N95 or P100).(33) Thus, the respirator is only expected to reduce the outside aerosol by 90% (i.e., no more than one-tenth the concentration of outside aerosol is allowed inside). The protection level (i.e., APF) is lower than the minimum N95 and P100 filter certification efficiency of 95 and 99.97%, respectively, to account for face seal leakage. In all cases, a well- administered respiratory protection program is necessary to evaluate hazards and to ensure that workers are provided with appropriate well-fitted respirators and properly trained in their use. Results from this study suggest that a good-sealing N95 or P100 particulate respirator worn to prevent exposure to a viral aerosol should perform adequately to meet the APF.",

Viral aerosols typically do not exist as single airborne viruses, instead they form agglomerates that typically are larger than the MPPS of the filter.(3,4,6) In the controlled laboratory conditions of this study, the resulting MS2 virus MMAD was approximately 500 nm. As a result, the viruses did not penetrate the filters to the extent of aerosols in the MPPS range (typically 40 to 50 nm for N95 filters).
