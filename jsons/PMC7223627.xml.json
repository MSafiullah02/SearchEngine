It has been widely used for preventing and treating upper respiratory tract infections, hyperlipidemia disease, and some epidemic disease such as SARs, H1N1, and hand\u2013foot\u2013mouth disease (Ku et al. 2009). In addition to its medicinal uses, FLJ is also used in healthy foods and cosmetics (Shang et al. 2011; Seo et al. 2012). Due to these reasons, there has been a high demand for FLJ in China. The steady supply of FLJ for traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical companies has been met through increased honeysuckle cultivation.",

Light not only sustains plant growth and development as an energy source, but also affects the synthesis of multiple secondary metabolites (Zhang et al. 2017). Extensive studies indicate that changes in light intensity can stimulate the synthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants (Zoratti et al. 2014; Shao et al. 2014; Yoneda et al. 2017; Ye et al. 2017). Tattini et al. (2004) found that the concentration of quercetin and luteolin derivatives in leaves of L. vulgare increases with light intensity, and that the content of quercetin 3-O-rutinoside and luteolin 7-O glucoside in leaves under 100% natural light is higher than that in plants exposed to only 35% and 6% natural light. Deng et al. (2012) also found that light intensity has a significantly positive effect on the content of total flavonoids, kaempferol, quercetin, and isoquercitrin in leaves of C. paliurus. Xu et al. (2014) reported that full sunlight can promote flavonol biosynthesis, including that of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin, in leaves of Gingko biloba.",

For instance, bagging of Pyrus pyrifolia inhibits the accumulation of anthocyanins as well as the expression of PpCHSs, chalcone isomerase (PpCHIs), PpF3Hs, flavonoid 3\u2032-hydroxylase (PpF3\u2032Hs), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (PpDFRs), and anthocyanidin synthase (PpANSs). At the same time, the expression of these genes is up-regulated 6 h after the removal of the bag (Bai et al. 2017). Xu et al.

In turn, plant development and environmental signals, such as light, salinity, temperature, and hormone concentration, affect the regulatory function of these transcription factors (Lai et al. 2013). For instance, Arabidopsis plants exposed to light display enhanced expression of MYB111, MYB12, and HY5 (bZIP family) as well as higher flavonoid content compared to dark-grown plants (Pandey et al. 2014). Koyama et al. (2012) also found that light induces the transcription of an array of R2R3 MYB transcription factors. These studies partly revealed the molecular mechanism of light-induced flavonoids synthesis. However, they also indicated that light-dependent control of signaling and physiological processes represent a complex regulatory network. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of light-induced flavonoid biosynthesis needs further analysis.",

One-year-old healthy and homogenous L. japonica seedlings (ground diameter 5.2~5.3 mm; seedling height 30.0~32.0 cm) were transferred to plastic pots (30.0 cm \u00d7 30.0 cm for inner-diameter and height, and one seedling per pot) filled with 2.5 kg of a substrate mixture of vermiculite: peat: soil (3:3:4, v/v/v), and then placed in the greenhouse with a 16:8 light/dark cycle and 65 \u00b1 5% relative humidity at 23 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C on February 20, 2017. Six weeks later, the plants were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10 per group), and each light intensity treatment consisted of two groups. Three light intensity levels were created by blocking light penetration using a black cloth stretched over a rigid frame. The light intensity groups were 100% light intensity (non-shade, CK-1, CK-2), 50% light intensity (50% shaded, LI50-1, LI50-2), 25% light intensity (75% shaded, LI25-1, LI25-2) (the fluorescent lights as the light resource). The light intensity was measured with a digital light meter (TES-1330A, Taiwan). The average light intensity passing through in each treatment was about 1300, 640, and 310 \u03bcmol m\u22122s\u22121 of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at noon time (May 2017) for CK, LI50 and LI25. Except for the light intensity, the other culture conditions were the same for each group. After treatment for 30 days, one hundred flower buds from the control and each treated group were harvested at 7:30 a.m. Parts of the collected sample were flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction, and the other parts were dried at 45 \u00b0C for chemical analysis.",

RNA integrity and concentration were then examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2%, w/v) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The high-quality RNA samples were sent to Gene Denovo Technologies Corporation (Guangzhou, China) for cDNA library construction and sequencing. Poly (A)-containing mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads, and mRNAs were fragmented into short sequences (~ 200nt) using fragmentation buffer. These short sequences were transcribed into first-strand cDNA using random hexamer primers and m-muLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-). The second-strand cDNA was synthesized using RNase H and DNA polymerase I. The cDNA fragments were purified using a QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc., Hilden, Germany), and then subjected to end repair and single dATP addition. Thereafter, these short fragments were connected with adapters, and the suitable fragments were screened as templates for PCR amplification. The transcriptome libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq\u2122 4000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at the Gene Denovo Institute (Guangzhou, China).",

Traditional Chinese medicine uses L. japonica to treat various diseases due to the anti-bacterial, and anti-viral properties of this plant. Some transcriptome-based reports focused on luteoloside biosynthesis, different tissues and floral developmental stages (Yuan et al. 2012; He et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2016b; Rai et al. 2017). Here, we found that light could promote the accumulation of luteoloside in L. japonica. Several studies elucidated the molecular mechanisms of light-induced secondary metabolism biosynthesis using Illumina deep sequencing technique (Zhang et al. 2016a; Hao et al. 2017). Therefore, we also attempted to explain the light-induced flavonoid accumulation in L. japonica using this technology creating a transcriptome for different light intensity treatments. In our study, we sequenced six libraries (CK-1, CK-2, LI25-1, LI25-2, LI50-1 and LI50-2) from the flower buds of L. japonica under the different light intensity treatments using the Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform. We obtained 77,297 unigenes with an N50 value of 1281 bp, representing a better result than those obtained in previous works. For example, Zhang et al. (2016b) generated 150,523 unigenes with an N50 value of 947 bp using Illumina HiSeq\u2122. Furthermore, we observed that 43.94% of the unigenes were not found in any database searches. This might be the absence of genome information or the unique genes functions of L. japonica.",

            "text": "Flavonoids are important secondary metabolites in plants, and play multiple roles in plant growth, development, and adaptation to the external environment. In addition, they also have various pharmacological activities, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anticancer effects (Duthie et al. 2000). Therefore, promoting the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants has important practical significance. Extensive studies show that there are a large number of structural gene encoding enzymes, such as PAL, 4CH, CHI, F3H FLS, and UFGT, that directly influence the biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids (Winkel 2001). Moreover, the expression levels of these structural genes depend on a series of TFs (Hichri et al. 2010). In recent years, many studies have indicated that manipulation of TFs is a means to enhance flavonoid biosynthesis in plants (Pandey et al. 2014; Dalman et al. 2017). In our study, we identified a total of 1649 unigenes encoding for TFs. Among these, we found 98 DEGs of TFs responding to changes in light intensity, and divided them into 26 subfamilies (Figs. 7, 8). Light enhanced the expression of most of these genes in our experiment, suggesting that these DEGs may participate in flavonoid biosynthesis in L. japonica.",

            "text": "The MYB TFs family takes its name from its conserved MYB domain. It is one of the largest TF families in plants, involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes, including flavonoid biosynthesis (Dubos et al. 2010). Recent works identified and characterized many MYB TFs regulating flavonoid biosynthesis in model species (Gonzalez et al. 2008; Gesell et al. 2014). For instance, in A. thaliana, AtMYB12 activates the expression of AtFLS and AtCHS (Mehrtens et al. 2005). MYBs not only can regulate the expression of structural genes directly, but also can modulate interactions with protein partners such as bHLH or WD40 (MBW transcription complex) (Xu et al. 2015). Abiotic stresses, such as light, soil salinity, moisture, and temperature, affect the expression of TFs. In Litchi chinensis, light exposure promotes the expression of LcMYB1 and anthocyanin accumulation relative to bagging in the pericarp (Lai et al. 2014). In Vitis vinifera, light controls the co-expression of MYB, bHLH, WRKY, and MADS-box, and in turn that of the structural genes in flavonoid biosynthesis (Sun et al. 2017). In this study, the expression of four MYB TFs, two bHLH TFs, and seven WD40 TFs were mostly up-regulated with light intensity enhanced, suggesting that MBW might participate in light-induced flavonoid biosynthesis.",

They have important functions in plant growth and development, including hormonal signal transduction, response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and regulation of metabolism (Nakano et al. 2006). In L. erythrorhizon, light significantly inhibits the transcription of LeERF-1, required in the biosynthesis of shikonin (Zhang et al. 2011). Moreover, Jiao et al. (1987) found that light reduces ethylene formation. Yuk et al. (2016) suggested that ethylene activates a set of structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. Here, we identified a total of 120 ERF TFs, representing the largest TF family in our transcriptome data. Among them, we detected six DEGs codifying for ERF TFs, of which three were up-regulated with the increase of light intensity, indicating that these ERFs might be involved in the interaction between light and ethylene.",

            "text": "NACs are another important plant-specific TF family, also involved in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis (Xiong et al. 2005). ANAC078 positively regulates flavonoid biosynthesis in responses to high light intensity in A. thaliana (Morishita et al. 2009). This suggests that NAC TFs may play an important role in light stress (Nakashima et al. 2012). In our experiment, 6 NAC TFs exhibited differential expression, and most of these were up-regulated except for Unigene0014311 and Unigene0075492 in response to high light. Therefore, we hypothesize that NAC TFs might directly or indirectly involve in flavonoid biosynthesis in response to light. As for the NAC family, WRKY is also a large family involved in the metabolic regulation, abiotic stress and physiological processes (Schluttenhofer and Yuan 2015). We found 12 WRKY TFs showing differential expression between three different treatments, including five unigenes up-regulated in response to the increase of light intensity, and seven other unigenes reached the highest expression at LI50, which suggests that these seven genes might also play a regulatory role in responses to light. Previous research demonstrated that the regulation of WRKY TFs in flavonoid production might relate to the MYB\u2013bHLH\u2013WD40 TF complex, indicating an interaction between WRKY TFs and other transcription factors in regulating specialized metabolism (Ishida et al. 2007; Amato et al. 2016). In conclusion, we hypothesize that WRKY TFs may regulate the flavonoid biosynthesis in combination with multiple TFs and hormone signaling.",
