Four were from other patients receiving oseltamivir treatment. Two were from patients who were not taking oseltamivir for either treatment or prophylaxis. In December 2009, WHO reported two clusters of patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses.

In 1916 Severy and in 1926 Schwake built the first negative-pressure ventilators, but these machines required the patient to stand. Although they incorporated mechanical elements, their practicality for severely ill patients was limited. The first negative pressure ventilator to be used successfully in clinical practice on a widespread basis was the Drinker-Shaw \u201ciron lung\u201d developed in 1928. Positive-pressure ventilation was reintroduced in 1950 after the experience generated with positive-pressure compression devices in 1927. During World War II, the first volume ventilator was introduced. Since then, mechanical ventilation has undergone continuous evolution, with the introduction of multiple new modes and applications [40].",
