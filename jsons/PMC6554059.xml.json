Two \u03b2-coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and was responsible for an epidemic that spread to five continents with a fatality rate of 10% before being contained in 2003 (with additional cases reported in 2004). The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats/palm civets1 and dromedary camels2, respectively. Four other coronaviruses of zoonotic origin are endemic in the human population, accounting for up to 30% of mild respiratory tract infections and causing severe complications or fatalities in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals3,4. These viruses are HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E (\u03b1-coronaviruses) and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (\u03b2-coronaviruses). Currently, no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available to combat any human coronavirus. Furthermore, future cross-species transmission events of coronaviruses seem likely, given the large reservoir found in bats5\u20137. Studying coronaviruses will therefore help in understanding the principles governing cross-species transmission and adaptation to humans and in preparing for putative future zoonotic outbreaks.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses use homotrimers of the spike (S) glycoprotein to promote host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes for entry. S is the main antigen present at the viral surface and is the target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. As a result, it is a focus of vaccine design. S is a class I viral fusion protein synthesized as a single polypeptide chain precursor of approximately 1,300 amino acids8. For many coronaviruses, S is processed by host proteases to generate two subunits, designated S1 and S2, which remain non-covalently bound in the pre-fusion conformation. The N-terminal S1 subunit comprises four \u03b2-rich domains, designated A, B, C and D, with domain A or B acting as receptor-binding domains in different coronaviruses. The transmembrane C-terminal S2 subunit is the metastable spring-loaded fusion machinery9. During entry, S2 is further proteolytically cleaved at the S2\u2032 site, immediately upstream of the fusion peptide10. This second cleavage step occurs for all coronaviruses and is believed to activate the protein for membrane fusion, which takes place via irreversible conformational changes11\u201314. In recent years, cryo-EM work led to the determination of coronavirus S glycoprotein ectodomain structures in the pre-fusion and post-fusion states, providing snapshots of the start and end points of the fusion reaction9,13,15\u201324. Cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins in complex with human neutralizing antibodies also informed about the mechanism of fusion activation25.",

Molecular clock analysis of genome sequences suggested that HCoV-OC43 originated from a zoonotic transmission event of a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and dated their most recent common ancestor between the 1890s and the 1950s26,27. HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) use 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) as a receptor, which is terminally linked to oligosaccharides decorating glycoproteins and gangliosides at the host cell surface28,29. The S glycoprotein of these viruses mediates 9-O-Ac-Sia binding, whereas the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein acts as receptor-destroying enzyme, via sialate-O-acetyl-esterase activity, to facilitate release of viral progeny from infected cells and escape from attachment to non-permissive host cells or decoys30\u201333. These properties are shared with the hemagglutinin-fusion-esterase (HEF) glycoproteins of influenza C and D viruses28,34\u201336.",

Previous biochemical work established that domain A of coronavirus S glycoproteins mediates attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, such as for HCoV-OC43 and BCoV, which interact with 9-O-Ac-Sia28,40,41, or MERS-CoV, which binds to \u03b12,3-linked (and to a lesser extent to \u03b12,6-linked) sialic acids, with sulfated sialyl-Lewis X being the preferred binder42. On the basis of the galectin-like fold of domain A of coronavirus S and mutational analyses, it was suggested that key saccharide-binding residues locate to the viral membrane distal side of the BCoV \u03b2-sandwich. Our recent work, however, indicated that the 9-O-Ac-Sia binding site of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV and PHEV is conserved among these viruses and resides at a distinct location of domain A43. Although we validated the findings using mutagenesis and BCoV infectivity assays, no structural information is available on the mechanism of coronavirus interaction with saccharides aside from in silico modeling43. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of the roles of these receptors in viral infection or zoonosis and hinders the rational design of inhibitors.",

We show that the ligand binds with fast association/dissociation kinetics in a groove on HCoV-OC43 S located at the surface of domain A. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with binding experiments validated our structural findings, and infectivity assays showed that the residues involved in 9-O-Ac-Sia binding are essential for HCoV-OC43 S\u2013mediated entry into host cells. Our results further show that binding to free 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia and/or acidic pH did not induce fusogenic conformational changes of S, suggesting that multivalent interactions with sialoglycans and/or further attachment to a putative proteinaceous receptor44 are essential to promote membrane fusion. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins known to attach to 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans and shares architectural similarity with the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus HEs and influenza virus C/D HEF glycoproteins, thus highlighting common structural principles of recognition45,46.",

HCoV-OC43 S folds as a 150-\u00c5 high and 130-\u00c5 wide compact trimer (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a,b and Table 1). The S1 subunit has a V-shaped architecture resulting from the 3D arrangement of its four domains (A, B, C and D), similarly to other \u03b2-coronavirus S structures9,17\u201325. The S2 subunit, which is more conserved than the S1 subunit among coronaviruses, folds as a mostly helical, elongated trimeric unit with a connector domain appended at its C-terminal end9,16 (Fig. 1a). Among available coronavirus S glycoprotein structures, HCoV-OC43 S is most similar to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S9 (r.m.s. deviation (r.m.s.d.) 4.7 \u00c5 over 979 aligned C\u03b1 positions) and to HCoV-HKU1 S18 (r.m.s.d. 4.5 \u00c5 over 949 aligned C\u03b1 positions), sharing 62% and 68% sequence identity, respectively. The cryo-EM reconstruction resolves 14 N-linked glycans extending from the surface of each protomer. The HCoV-OC43 S oligosaccharide density is comparable to that of SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S, with all three viruses belonging to the \u03b2-genus, but lower than the glycan density of the porcine delta coronavirus S (\u03b4-genus) or the HCoV-NL63 S (\u03b1-genus) glycoproteins16,17,25.",

For \u03b2-coronaviruses, the canonical architecture of domain B comprises a conserved five-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet, decorated with \u03b1-helices on both sides, and a highly variable external subdomain that can mediate receptor engagement for SARS-CoV19,47 or MERS-CoV48. Domain B of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are structurally similar and can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.0 \u00c5 over 251 aligned C\u03b1 positions49, with differences largely restricted to the external subdomain (Fig. 1b). The current consensus in the field is that HCoV-OC43 S does not rely on receptors other than 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans for promoting viral entry into host cells. In contrast with the MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV S glycoproteins19\u201321,23,25,50, in which domain B adopts alternative conformations, we detected a single closed conformation of domain B in the HCoV-OC43 S structure (Fig. 1a). Only the closed domain B conformation was also observed for the MHV S9, HCoV-NL63 S16, HCoV-HKU1 S18, PDCoV S17,24 and IBV S22 glycoprotein structures.",

To directly visualize the binding site and characterize the molecular details of the interactions, we incubated the HCoV-OC43 S protein with 100 mM 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia, prior to vitrification and cryo-EM data collection. We determined a 3D reconstruction of the stabilized HCoV-OC43 S protein in complex with its receptor at 2.8-\u00c5 resolution, hereafter referred to as holo-HCoV-OC43 S (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d and Table 1). The resolution estimate is supported by the visible ordered water molecules interacting with the S glycoprotein, as expected at this resolution51. The structure reveals that the ligand interacts with a groove at the periphery of domain A, in agreement with the biochemical observations reported by Hulswit et al43 (Fig. 2a\u2013c). The receptor therefore docks into a distinct groove from those used by either human galectin-3 (ref. 52) or the rhesus rotavirus sialic acid-attachment protein53 (VP8*) to recognize their respective ligands (Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013c).",

The 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia C1-carboxylate forms a salt bridge with the Lys81 side chain amine and a hydrogen bond with the Ser83 side chain hydroxyl (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3). The 5-nitrogen atom of the ligand makes a hydrogen bond with the Lys81 backbone carbonyl (Fig. 2c). The ligand N-acetyl methyl inserts into the P2 hydrophobic pocket, defined by residues Leu80, Trp90 and Phe95. The ligand 9-O-acetyl methyl docks in the P1 hydrophobic pocket, which comprises Leu85, Leu86 and Trp90, whereas the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl makes a hydrogen bond with the Asn27 side chain amide. These observations rationalize the specificity of HCoV-OC43 S for this sialoside, because the 9-O-acetyl group is accommodated by a combination of hydrogen bonding and shape complementarity (Fig. 2b,c), similarly to 9-O-Ac-Sia binding sites of coronavirus, torovirus and orthomyxovirus HEs/HEFs32\u201335,43,54. Although most interactions occur with the same side of the ligand, the side chain hydroxyl of residue Thr31, which faces the 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia solvent-exposed side, forms a hydrogen bond with the Trp90 indole nitrogen. This interaction participates in stapling the A domain N-terminal segment to the \u03b2-sandwich core and contributes to defining the shape of the ligand-binding groove (Fig. 2c). Overall, the ligand buries 350 \u00c52 of its surface upon binding to the HCoV-OC43 S protein, corresponding to approximately 62% of the 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia total solvent-accessible surface area. The observed binding mode is compatible with interactions with longer oligosaccharides, including \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked sialoglycans found on cell surfaces.",

Domain A bound to and dissociated from 6-sialyl-5-N,9-O-acetyl-lactosamine (9-O-Ac-6SLN) with fast on and off rates. (Fig. 3a). The observed binding was specific, as it was critically dependent on the presence of the sialate-9-O-acetyl moiety, in accordance with previous observations28,32,43,55. Domain A did not detectably bind to the corresponding non-O-acetylated oligosaccharide, 6SLN. This finding is explained by the absence of the 9-O-acetyl moiety in 6SLN, which contributes one-third of the total ligand buried surface area by contacting Asn27 and the P1 pocket of the glycoprotein, as revealed in our structure (Fig. 2b,c). Moreover, binding was largely abolished by de-O-acetylation of biosensor-bound 9-O-Ac-6SLN with porcine torovirus HE (Fig. 3a). Finally, substitution of Trp90 with alanine abrogated interactions with 9-O-Ac-6SLN (Fig. 3a), thereby confirming the central role for sialoside attachment of this amino acid residue that defines the floor of the ligand-binding groove43.",

We calculated a half-life of t1/2 = 0.7 s from the dissociation curves, a dissociation rate constant koff = 1 s\u22121 (koff = t1/2/ln2) and an association rate constant kon = 1.4 \u00d7 104 M\u22121s\u22121. These values predict rapid S-mediated virion attachment, particularly in high-density receptor environments such as the mucus layer, glycocalyx and cell surfaces. On the basis of these results, the mean life (1/koff) of the 1:1 complex is predicted be short, in the order of 1 s, much shorter than the mean life of an individual influenza A hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain in complex with sialic acid, which ranges between 7 and 13.5 s56. In the context of authentic virions, however, the large number of S glycoproteins at the surface of coronaviruses is likely to increase the apparent binding affinity for sialoglycans through avidity, as described for influenza virus57. We posit that HCoV-OC43 and related \u03b2-coronavirus S glycoproteins evolved to dynamically interact with host sialosides and avoid irreversible attachment to decoy receptors via HE-mediated virion elution. Dynamic binding in combination with receptor destruction could promote virion motility by directional sliding diffusion through high-density interaction sites, as recently reported for influenza A and C viruses58\u201360.",

To validate this finding, we investigated the effect of ligand binding to wild-type HCoV-OC43 S (that is, with a native S1/S2 cleavage site sequence) in various biochemical conditions. Importantly, the HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer remained uncleaved after secretion (Supplementary Fig. 4a), perhaps owing to the paucity of furin present in the secretory pathway of HEK293F cells61. Incubation of the wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer with trypsin at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 28 \u00b5g\u2219ml\u22121 (w/v), to recapitulate proteolytic priming13, led to cleavage at the S1\u2013S2 boundary, as observed via SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Incubation with 28 \u00b5g\u2219ml\u22121 trypsin also led to cleavage of a small fraction of S at a second site, yielding a band with an apparent molecular weight of ~55 kDa, which could be consistent with cleavage at the S2\u2032 site (Supplementary Fig. 4a), an event believed to be restricted to fusion triggering upon receptor engagement for SARS-CoV S11 or MERS-CoV S12,62. EM analysis of negatively stained samples, however, showed that the HCoV-OC43 S trimers remained in the pre-fusion conformation and were highly stable, even at the highest trypsin concentration tested (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Furthermore, we did not detect conformational changes (i) of pre-cleaved wild-type HCoV-OC43 S incubated with 100 mM 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia, (ii) after trypsin cleavage of 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia-bound wild-type HCoV-OC43 S or (iii) of pre-cleaved wild-type HCoV-OC43 S incubated at pH 4.5 (Supplementary Fig. 4c\u2013f). Therefore, 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia binding and pH acidification of the medium, such as the one occurring in the endosomal compartment, did not trigger HCoV-OC43 S fusogenic conformational changes.",

In the latter conditions, we noticed the formation of HCoV-OC43 S rosettes arising from the nonspecific interactions of multiple post-fusion trimers via the hydrophobic fusion peptides (Supplementary Fig. 4h). These biochemical conditions lowered the energy barrier between the metastable pre-fusion state and the post-fusion (ground) state, acting as a surrogate for receptor-mediated fusion activation. This finding indicated that the wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer could refold to the post-fusion conformation, although neither free 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia nor pH acidification triggered this transition. It has been previously established that caveolin-mediated endocytosis is a major route of HCoV-OC43 entry into host cells63. Because we demonstrated interactions of sialoglycans with the identified site are necessary for S-mediated viral entry, we hypothesize that membrane fusion occurs upon formation of multivalent interactions with sialoglycans (via mechanical destabilization of the pre-fusion trimers) and/or binding to a putative proteinaceous receptor44, before or after virus internalization. In conclusion, 9-O-Ac-Sia-containing receptors appear to differ from the proteinaceous SARS-CoV receptor, because addition of monomeric angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ectodomain to wild-type SARS-CoV S trimers, in the presence of trypsin, promoted refolding to the post-fusion state23,25.",

Strikingly, BCoV HE and influenza HEF similarly interact with 9-O-Ac-Sia, despite ample differences in the architecture of their ligand-binding pockets33,34,43. Specifically, the two methyl groups of the ligand are docked into two hydrophobic depressions separated by an aromatic amino acid side chain, and hydrogen bonds are formed with the 5-nitrogen of the neuraminic acid core and the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl (Fig. 5a\u2013c). The similarity across the three binding sites is reinforced by the observation that 9-O-Ac-Sia buries a comparable surface area at the interface with each of these glycoproteins and that the 9-O-acetyl moiety makes a major contribution to it in all three cases (~110 \u00c52). One notable difference, however, is that the C1 carboxylate anchors the ligand to HCoV-OC43 S via a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond, whereas it relies on the formation of one or two hydrogen bonds with the BCoV HE or influenza HEF lectin domains, respectively. These results expand on our previous biochemical work43 to demonstrate that BCoV HE and influenza HEF use structural principles similar to those of other 9-O-Ac-sialoglycan-recognizing human and animal coronaviruses for engagement to host cell receptors.",

This site is conserved in all other coronaviruses known to attach to 9-O-Ac-Sia, including HCoV-HKU1 S (another endemic human coronavirus), and BCoV S (the presumptive zoonotic ancestor of HCoV-OC43). Our results provide a molecular framework explaining the specific recognition of 9-O-Ac-Sia-decorated oligosaccharides present at the surface of host cells targeted by these viruses. The \u03b2-sandwich architecture of domain A is conserved among all coronaviruses, and some of them feature a duplication of this domain at the S glycoprotein N-terminal region16. Other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV (\u03b2-coronavirus), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, \u03b3-coronavirus), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (\u03b1-coronavirus) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (\u03b1-coronavirus) have been described to also bind to sialoglycans (distinct from 9-O-Ac-sialosides) via their A domains during host cell infection42,64\u201366. The ligand-binding pocket identified in the holo-HCoV-OC43 S structure is not conserved in the MERS-CoV or in the IBV A domains, for which structures are available, suggesting that host attachment of this subset of viruses involve different interactions. The conserved topology of domain A among coronavirus S glycoproteins indicate that it derived from divergent evolution of an ancestral galectin domain. Viral evolution and adaptation thus lead to the use of distinct binding residues on the same domain putatively to acquire different ligand specificities such as 9-O-Ac-sialosides versus non-O-acetylated-sialoglycans. This evolutionary plasticity is reminiscent of what has been described for the BCoV HE lectin domain in comparison with influenza A/B hemagglutinin and influenza C/D HEF33,35.",

Modulation of attachment to sialoglycans can therefore have profound effects on zoonotic transmission, tropism and virulence of many viruses. For instance, a single point mutation in the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus hemagglutinin was proposed to account for most of the preference switch from avian enteric tract receptors (\u03b12,3-linked sialic acid) to human respiratory tract receptors (\u03b12,6-linked sialic acid)57. Although influenza A/B hemagglutinin, influenza C/D HEF and coronavirus HE have distinct architectures compared with those of coronavirus S glycoproteins, common rules of ligand engagement emerge. These rules also appear to extend to the interactions of sialoglycans with adenoviruses67 and reoviruses68. In all cases, sialic acid binding involves burying a small surface area (300\u2013400 \u00c52) through contacts with a solvent-exposed groove of the protein. One face of the sialic acid ligand makes extensive interactions with the viral proteins, whereas the opposite, solvent-exposed face, makes few contacts. The binding affinity for sialic acids usually ranges between the micromolar and millimolar range, and the aforementioned viruses display numerous oligomeric spikes to enhance adsorption to target receptors through avidity57.",

            "text": "Despite these similarities, marked differences in the 3D organization of the binding sites explain the selectivity of different viruses for unmodified or modified sialic acids. The ligand-binding sites of BCoV HE, influenza HEF and a subset of coronavirus S glycoproteins have evolved to specifically recognize 9-O-Ac-Sia via hydrogen bonding with the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl moiety and formation of a hydrophobic pocket accommodating the 9-O-acetyl methyl32\u201334,43,54. In contrast, influenza hemagglutinin cannot accommodate 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acids, owing to steric restrictions, but a subset of hemagglutinins can bind to N-glycolyl neuraminic acids57,69. The HCoV-OC43 S, HCoV-HKU1 S, BCoV S and PHEV S glycoproteins therefore share the ligand specificity of influenza C/D HEF but are functionally more similar to influenza A/B hemagglutinin, by carrying receptor attachment and membrane fusion functions, whereas a dedicated HE (coronaviruses) or neuraminidase (influenza A/B) is responsible for the receptor-destroying activity. In conclusion, our results illuminate how coronaviruses recognize 9-O-Ac-sialosides to enable infection of susceptible cells and show that a conserved strategy is utilized to engage such ligands across coronaviruses and orthomyxoviruses.",

Relion 3D classification without symmetry was used to select ~83,000 and ~178,000 particles from apo- and holo-HCoV-OC43 S, respectively. CTF refinement in Relion3.0 (ref. 73) was used to refine per-particle defocus values. Particle images were subjected to the Bayesian polishing procedure implemented in Relion3.0 (refs. 73,74) before performing another round of per-particle defocus refinement. The particles were then subjected to 3D classification without refining angles and shifts using the same soft mask as that used during 3D refinement and with a tau value of 30. Final 3D refinement of the apo- and holo-HCoV-OC43 S datasets imposing C3 symmetry was carried out using non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC75 and yielded reconstructions at 2.9- and 2.8-\u00c5 resolution, respectively. Local resolution estimation, filtering and sharpening was carried out using CryoSPARC.

Monomeric domain A, wild type or with a W90A substitution, was subsequently obtained by on-the-bead thrombin cleavage33, after which the proteins were concentrated to up to 3.8 mg\u2219ml\u22121 in PBS, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. Biolayer interferometry analysis was performed on an Octet RED384 machine. All assays were performed using Fortebio Kinetics Buffer (KB; PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween20 and 0.05% sodium azide) at 30 \u00b0C. Synthetic biotinylated 6-sialyl-5-N-,9-O-acetyl-lactosamine (9OAc6SLN) or 6-sialyl-5-N-acetyl-lactosamine (6SLN) dissolved to 100 nM were loaded onto streptavidin (SA) biosensors to maximum loading levels (until no further increase in reflection was observed). Sensors were washed in KB until a stable baseline was obtained. Binding of monomeric HCoV-OC43 S domain A was performed by moving receptor-loaded sensors to wells containing 100 \u03bcl of purified protein, dissolved in KB to various concentrations, for up to 3 min, then dissociating for 3 min dissociation. To abolish unspecific binding, sensors were subjected to five successive association/dissociation cycles. To test whether binding of domain A was sialate-9-O-acetyl-dependent, biosensors loaded with 9OAc6SLN were de-O-acetylated by dipping them in wells containing 20 \u03bcg\u2219ml\u22121 porcine torovirus P4 HE-Fc45 in KB for 30 min, then washing prior to association/dissociation (pre-HE) or after a cycle of association/dissociation, upon which the biosensors were subjected to a final cycle (post-HE). The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, was determined from three independent experiments with the \u2018Response\u2019 option of the Octet Data Analysis software. The half-life of the domain A\u20139OAc6SLN complex was calculated manually from the dissociation curves.",

For coexpression of HCoV-OC43 S and BCoV HE-Fc, S expression vectors and pCD5-BCoV HE-Fc were mixed at molar ratios of 8:1. At 48 h after transfection, cells were transduced with VSV-G\u2013pseudotyped VSV\u0394G/Fluc90 at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Cell-free supernatants were harvested at 24 h after transduction and filtered through 0.45-\u03bcm membranes, and virus particles were purified and concentrated via sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation at approximately 100,000g for 3 h. Pelleted virions were resuspended in PBS and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. Inoculation of HRT18 monolayers in 96-well format was performed with equal amounts of S-pseudotyped virions, as calculated from VSV-N content (roughly corresponding to the yield from 2 \u00d7 105 transfected and transduced cells), diluted in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM. At 18 h post infection, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase expression was measured using a firefly luciferase assay system. Infection experiments were performed independently in triplicate, each time with three technical replicates. Pseudovirus incorporation of flag-tagged OC43 S was determined for the parental type and each of the mutants via Western blotting and by calculating the S content (measured with monoclonal antibody ANTI-FLAG M2; Sigma) relative to that of VSV-N (measured with anti-VSV-N monoclonal antibody 10G4; Kerafast).",
