Although, there is a decreasing trend of parasitic infection worldwide due to improved socioeconomic conditions and better hygiene practices, the urbanization of the cities around the world, global climate changes, international traveling, and increasing numbers of immunocompromised individuals have expanded the population who is vulnerable to parasitic diseases [1]. The diagnosis of parasitic diseases of the respiratory system is relatively difficult because clinical manifestations and radiologic findings are non-specific. Therefore, high index of suspicion, travel history, and a detailed interrogation of personal hygiene are crucial for diagnosis of parasitic lung diseases. The helminthes can affect respiratory system in different phases of their life cycle. In this chapter, we discuss the clinical manifestations, radiographic, bronchoscopic and pathologic findings, and management of several helminthic and protozoal lung diseases. The term \u201cpneumatodes\u201d has been used to represent the group of parasites that affect airways and lungs. Some of the unique presentations of each parasite are also addressed which may be helpful to pulmonologist in managing these uncommon diseases (Tables 11.1 and 11.2).\n\n",

Pleuropulmonary amebiasis occurs mainly by local extension from the amoebic liver abscess. Patients usually present with fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, chest pain, and cough. Lung abscess, hepatobronchial fistula, and pyopneumothorax can occur as complications from pleuropulmonary amebiasis. The radiographic findings are elevated right hemidiaphragm, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusion. Live trophozoites of E. histolytica can be found in sputum, pleural fluid, or lung biopsy. The presence of amoeba in the stool does not indicate active E. histolytica infection because there are two other non-pathologic Entamoeba species found in humans. A combination of serologic tests with detection of the parasite by antigen detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most preferred approach to diagnosis [3]. Metronidazole is treatment of choice for invasive amoebiasis.",

A. lumbricoides is transmitted through the feco-oral route. Ascaris larvae migrate to the lungs via either the venules of the portal system or the lymphatic drainage. Larval ascariasis causes L\u00f6ffler\u2019s syndrome, consisting of wheezing, pulmonary infiltrations, and a moderate eosinophilia [15]. The larvae can cause alveolar inflammation, necrosis, and hemorrhage. It is difficult to diagnose ascariasis infestation during its larvae phase. The sputum may show numerous eosinophils. However, stool examination usually yields negative results for eggs during larval stage because there is no reproducing adult ascaris in the host to produce eggs [16]. The diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion. Occasionally, the diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying larvae in the sputum. Solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) can also develop if the larva dies and evokes a granulomatous reaction [17]. Adult ascaris has been reported to cause airway obstruction in a child producing a complete lobar collapse [18]. Mechanical removal of ascaris through bronchoscopy is the management of choice. Mebendazole and albendazole are the most effective agents against ascariasis. The prognosis is excellent after eradication of ascariasis with anti-parasitic agents.",

Hookworm larvae enter human hosts via the skin, producing itching and local infection. A. duodenale larvae are also orally infective [19]. Hookworm infestation involves larval migration through the lungs via the bloodstream resulting in a hypersensitivity reaction. Patients usually present with transient eosinophilic pneumonia (L\u00f6ffler\u2019s syndrome) [19]. Patients may ingest a large number of A. duodenale larvae and develop a condition known as Wakana disease. It is characterized by nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, cough, throat irritation, hoarseness, and eosinophilia [19]. Larval migration may also cause alveolar hemorrhage [20]. Similar to ascariasis, the diagnosis of a hookworm infestation during the larvae phase could be difficult. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest may reveal transient, migratory, patchy alveolar infiltrates [21]. Sputum examination may reveal occult blood, eosinophils, and, rarely, migrating larvae [22]. Bronchoscopic examination may reveal airway erythema and high eosinophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [23]. Patients can become profoundly anemic and malnourished. These manifestations may provide clinical clues to support the diagnosis. Anti-parasitic agents for hookworm are mebendazole and albendazole.",

Infective filariform larvae can penetrate the skin and infect human hosts. The larvae migrate through the soft tissues and enter the lungs via the bloodstream. A majority of roundworms migrate up the bronchial tree to the pharynx and are swallowed, entering the gastrointestinal tract [24]. The larvae can reenter the circulatory system, returning to the lungs and causing autoinfection [24]. The life cycle of Strongyloides can be completed entirely within one host. The term \u201chyperinfection syndrome\u201d describes the presentation of sepsis from enteric flora, mostly in immunocompromised patients [25]. The hallmarks of hyperinfection are exacerbation of gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms, and the detection of large number of larvae in stool and sputum [26]. Common pulmonary symptoms include wheezing, hoarseness, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Chest X-ray usually demonstrates focal or bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Pleural effusions are present in 40 % of patients, and lung abscess is found in 15 % [27]. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is usually found in patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) may result as a reaction to the dead larvae. A massive migration of larvae through the intestinal wall can result in sepsis from gram-negative bacteria [26]. Strongyloides infestation can be potentially fatal if untreated.",

However, false-negative results can occur during acute infection as it takes 4\u20136 weeks to mount the immune response [30]. ELISA is sensitive but non-specific due to cross-reactivity with filarial infestations [28]. Oral ivermectin remains the treatment of choice for uncomplicated Strongyloides infection.

Most cases of human syngamosis are reported from tropical areas, including South America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia [32]. The life cycle is not completely known. Two hypotheses have been proposed in regard to its life cycle. One is that humans become infested via the ingestion of food or water contaminated with larvae or embryonated eggs. The larvae complete the life cycle in the pulmonary system, and the adult worms migrate to the central airways as the preferred site of infection [33]. An alternative hypothesis is that the patients are infected by the adult worms present in contaminated food or water. This mode of transmission is supported by its short incubation period (6\u201311 days) [34]. The diagnosis is usually made by flexible bronchoscopy or when the worms are expelled after vigorous coughing. The removal of parasites through bronchoscopy is sufficient to improve the symptoms. There are no studies to support the effectiveness of antihelminthic drugs. However, they may be considered as an adjunct in the treatment [34, 35].",

The endemic areas of dirofilariasis are Southern Europe, Asia, Australia, and America. D. immitis is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes harboring infective third-stage larvae. The larva travels to the right ventricle and develops into an immature adult worm. It is then swept into the pulmonary arteries. The worm dies as a result of the inflammatory response and evokes granuloma formation [36]. A majority of patients with pulmonary dirofilariasis are asymptomatic. However, some patients may develop cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, fever, dyspnea, and mild eosinophilia ~5 %) [37]. A peripheral or a pleural-based SPN is a typical presentation. The nodule may show increased fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) avidity on a positron emission tomography (PET) scan [38, 39] and is often confused with malignancy. Calcification occurs within only 10 % of these nodules. CT may show a branch of pulmonary artery entering the nodule [40]. Serology has poor specificity due to cross-reactivity with other helminthes. The diagnosis is established by identifying the worm in the excised lung tissue (Figs. 11.4 and 11.5\n). In patients with high risk of cancer, these lung nodules may be confused with malignancy. Needle biopsy and brushings are usually non-diagnostic due to the small sample size. The condition is self-limiting and does not require any specific treatment [37].\n\n",

It is a mosquito-borne infestation. The larvae reside in the lymphatics and develop into mature adult worms. The endemic areas of TPE are in the tropical and subtropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. Travelers from non-endemic areas are at risk of developing TPE because they do not have natural immunity against microfilaria compared with subjects living in endemic area. The microfilariae are released into the circulation and may be trapped in the pulmonary circulation [41]. Trapped microfilariae demonstrate a strong immunogenicity and trigger anti-microfilarial antibodies, resulting in asthma-like symptoms. The hallmark of TPE is a high absolute eosinophil count (5000\u201380,000/mm3) [42]. The radiologic features include reticulonodular opacities predominantly in the middle and the lower lung zones, miliary mottling, and predominant hila with increased vascular markings at the bases [43]. Chest CT may demonstrate bronchiectasis, air trapping, calcification, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy [44]. Pulmonary functions indicate a restrictive defect with mild airway obstruction [42]. BAL fluid may contain numerous eosinophils. Occasionally, microfilaria can be identified on brushings or biopsies [45]. The chronic phase of TPE may lead to progressive and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis [41].",

These roundworms are common parasites that cause visceral larva migrans and eosinophilic lung disease in humans. Toxocariasis is transmitted to humans via ingestion of food that is contaminated with parasite eggs. The larvae can migrate throughout the host\u2019s body, including the lungs [5]. The pathologic manifestations of visceral larva migrans are due to a hypersensitivity response to the migrating larvae. Visceral larva migrans can present with fever, cough, wheezing, seizures, and anemia. Examination features include general lymph node enlargement, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Leukocytosis and severe eosinophilia are demonstrated in a peripheral smear. Chest X-ray reveals pulmonary infiltrates with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bilateral pleural effusion can occur [47]. Non-cavitating pulmonary nodules have also been reported [48]. The diagnosis of toxocariasis is established by an ELISA for the larval antigens [49]. The treatment of choice is DEC; however, DEC may exacerbate the inflammatory reactions due to killing of larvae. Thus, it is advised to use corticosteroid along with DEC to ease the inflammatory response [5].",

Fertilized female worms release first-stage larvae into the bloodstream and the lymphatics [51]. Pulmonary involvement, although uncommon, produces shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates. Dyspnea is due to parasitic invasion of the diaphragm and the accessory respiratory muscles [39]. The diagnosis is confirmed by muscle biopsy, which may demonstrate T. spiralis larvae.

Chest X-ray and CT may show diffuse reticulonodular pattern or ground-glass opacities [57]. In the acute phase, BALF may reveal eosinophilia in the absence of parasites. The diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination of stool and urine or by rectal biopsy. However, the sensitivity of these tests is low for an early infection. ELISA can be used as a screening test and is confirmed by enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot. These tests become positive within 2 weeks after the infestation.

Infection of paragonimus species is geographically distributed in Southeast Asia, African, and South America. The mode of transmission is ingestion of the metacercaria (infective larvae) from undercooked crustaceans. Undercooked meat of crab-eating mammals (wild boars and rat) can infect humans as indirect route of transmission [60]. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall, migrating through the diaphragm and the pleura, into the bronchioles [61]. The eggs are produced by the mature adult worms which are expelled in the sputum or swallowed and passed with the stool. Typically acute symptoms include fever, chest pain, and chronic cough with hemoptysis [62]. Pleural effusion and pneumothorax may be the first manifestation during the migration of the juvenile worms through the pleura. Chest X-ray demonstrates patchy infiltrates, nodular opacities, pleural effusion, and fluid-filled cysts with ring shadows [5]. Chest CT may reveal a band-like opacity abutting the visceral pleura (worm migration tracks), bronchial wall thickening, and centrilobular nodules. Bronchoscopic examination may reveal airway narrowing from mucosal edema [63]. Lung biopsy may show chronic eosinophilic inflammation. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of eggs or larvae in the sputum sample or BALF. The pleural fluid, when present, is an exudate with eosinophilia, mostly sterile, without the presence of any organisms [64]. Eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels are observed in more than 80 % of infected patients [5]. Serological tests with ELISA and a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) are highly sensitive and specific for establishing the diagnosis [65]. Praziquantel and triclabendazole are the treatments of choice with a high cure rate of 90 and 98.5 %, respectively [5].",

The patients may present with hydropneumothorax or empyema. Occasionally, a ruptured cyst can cause an anaphylactic-like reaction and pneumonia [21]. Cystic hydatidosis is diagnosed by chest radiography which demonstrates a well-defined homogenous fluid-filled round opacity. Ruptured cysts may demonstrate an empty cavity, but it is more usual to have characteristic features such as air crescent, pneumocyst, and floating membrane (\u201cwater lily sign\u201d) (Fig. 11.6) on radiologic examination [68]. The \u201cmeniscus\u201d or \u201ccrescent\u201d sign and Cumbo\u2019s sign (onion peel) have also been described. Thoracic ultrasonography may be useful to confirm the cystic structure, demonstrating the characteristic double-contour (pericyst and parasitic membrane endocyst) of intact cysts. Daughter cysts are also occasionally observed in pulmonary hydatidosis [68]. Bronchoscopic examination reveals sac-like cysts in the airway (Fig. 11.7). Bronchoscopic extraction of the hydatid cyst is possible; however, there is a risk of cyst rupture. Therefore, it should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Serological tests are more sensitive in patients with liver involvement (80\u201394 %) than with lung hydatidosis (65 %) [5]. Hydatid cyst rupture can increase sensitivity of serological tests to be more than 90 % [67]. Surgical resection of the cysts is the main treatment of pulmonary hydatidosis and aims to remove the intact hydatid cyst and treat associated parenchymal and bronchial disease. The principle of surgery is to preserve as much as lung tissue as possible. Lung parenchyma around a hydatid cyst is often affected by the lesion and may show chronic congestion, hemorrhage, and interstitial pneumonia. These inflammatory changes in the lung tissue often resolve after surgery [69]. Spillage of hydatid fluid must be avoided to prevent secondary hydatidosis. After complete removal of hydatid cyst, the cavity needs to be irrigated with hypertonic saline solution and it is obliterated with separate purse-string sutures. Surgical specimens may reveal echinococcus cyst fragments (Figs. 11.8 and 11.9).\n\n\n\n",

Antihelminthic agents, such as mebendazole or albendazole, have shown only 25\u201334 % cure rates [70]. The disadvantage of antihelminthic therapy is that it may weaken the cyst wall and increases the risk of spontaneous rupture. In addition, if the parasite dies due to the drug, the cyst membrane may remain within the cavity and lead to secondary complications, including infections [71]. Percutaneous treatment by puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration (PAIR) has rarely been used in pulmonary cysts because of the risk of anaphylactic shock, pneumothorax, pleural spillage, and bronchopleural fistulae [72].",

Chest X-ray or CT may aid in the diagnosis. ELISA and indirect hemagglutination assay are available and offer early detection in endemic areas. Radical resection of localized lesions is the only curative treatment yet and is rarely possible in invasive and disseminated disease.

Recent molecular studies have categorized class Mesomycetozoea at the border of animal\u2013fungal kingdom [74]. The infection is endemic in South Asia [75]. Patients usually presents with polypoidal lesions which are friable and have a high risk of bleeding during resection and high tendency of recurrence. The common sites of presentation are nose and nasopharynx. However, lesions can involve tracheobronchial tree which may lead to partial or complete airway obstruction [76]. There are only three case reports of bronchial involvement which all of them are reported from South Asia. CT is the preferred imaging technique since it offers details of the extension of disease. Bronchoscopic management plays a major role in bronchial involvement of rhinosporidiosis. The mass can completely cauterized with bronchoscopic snare and excised mass can be removed by the basket. Microscopic examination of the resected specimen demonstrated bronchial subepithelium with sporangia filled with small round endospores. The bleeding can be controlled by cauterization. Dapsone is the only medication found to arrest the maturation of the sporangia, but the lesion may recur after months or years [77]. Thus, follow-up bronchoscopy is recommended to monitor early signs of recurrence.",
