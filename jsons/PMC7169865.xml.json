            "text": "In April 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) emerged as a new swine enteric disease in US swine (Stevenson et al., 2013). Within 1 year after introduction, the virus had spread to most swine\u2010producing areas and caused the loss of approximately 7 million pigs, affecting primarily neonates within the first few weeks of life. The economic losses due to the introduction of PED are substantial, with estimates of $300,000 lost per year for a single 700\u2010sow farrow\u2010to\u2010finishing herd (Weng, Weersink, Poljak, de Lange, & von Massow, 2016). The causative agent, PED virus (PEDV), is an enveloped, positive\u2010sense RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus with a 28 kb genome (Kocherhans, Bridgen, Ackermann, & Tobler, 2001). The virus was first described in Europe almost 40 years ago (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978; Wood, 1977) and had been primarily maintained as an endemic pathogen in European and Asian swine populations until its introduction into North American in 2013. Since the 1990s, significant outbreaks of PED have occurred in The Czech Republic, Belgium, Hungary, Korea, China, Italy and Thailand (Song & Park, 2012) with a re\u2010emergence of PED as a major swine disease in China around 2010 (Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). Sequence analysis of US strains showed greater than 99% nucleotide identity to strains circulating in China between 2011 and 2012, indicating a probable Chinese origin of the US strain (Chen et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2013). Since 2013, PED has been a significant disease in the US swine industry, with 39 states and >3,750 premises being confirmed as positive for the virus as of December 2017 (USDA, 2017).",

The virus is an enveloped, positive\u2010sense RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae and genus Deltacoronavirus with a 25.4 kb genome (Wang et al., 2014a). Prior to its US introduction, PDCoV had previously only been described in China in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012). Sequence analysis of US strains showed approximately 99% nucleotide identity to the PDCoV strains previously detected in Hong Kong in 2012 (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014b). Since its introduction in 2014, PDCoV has spread throughout most swine\u2010producing states, albeit at a lower prevalence rate than PEDV, with 21 states and >540 premises being confirmed as positive for the virus as of December 2017 (USDA, 2017). Subsequent to US introduction, PDCoV has since been detected in Thailand and Korea (Janetanakit et al., 2016; Lee & Lee, 2014).",

Since PEDV and PDCoV emerged into the US swine population, much research has been performed to understand the factors around pathogenesis, immunity, introduction, transmission and management of these diseases; however, SECD continue to be introduced into new herds each week and gaps in knowledge remain. Tissue tropism, diagnosis, viral structure and proteins, physiochemical properties and pathophysiology of PEDV and PDCoV have been reviewed elsewhere (Jung & Saif, 2015; Jung et al., 2016; Lee, 2015; Zhang, 2016). The current review describes the characteristics of these viruses, such as a low oral infectious dose, survival in feed and prolonged viral shedding, which create both opportunities and challenges for future management and potential eradication.",

Soon thereafter, PEDV spread rapidly and within weeks had been detected in most swine\u2010producing states in the United States (Figure 1). By 3 June 2013, a mere 8 weeks after the initial case, PEDV was present in 12 states and Iowa had 85 total positive cases reported. And by approximately 14 months after the introduction of PEDV, it was estimated that 50% of the breeding herds in the United States had been infected (Goede & Morrison, 2016; Goede et al., 2015). Stevenson et al. (2013) described one of the first outbreaks on four different swine farms in Iowa, reporting high mortality in suckling pigs with diarrhoea and vomiting in pigs of varying ages. PEDV was sequenced and compared between the four unassociated farms; strains were close to 100% identical and suggested that the virus introduced on all four farms had originated via the same source (Stevenson et al., 2013). Retrospective analysis of serum collected from feral swine (n = 368) in six states between 2011 and 2013 was all negative for PEDV on ELISA, suggesting a lack of viral circulation in wild pigs prior to introduction in commercial swine (Scott et al., 2016).",

Wang et al. (2014a) described the initial outbreak in Ohio, where both sows and young pigs were reported to have watery diarrhoea. However, death loss in neonatal pigs described in this outbreak was significantly less (30%\u201340% mortality) than what had been reported for PEDV (approaching 100%) (Wang et al., 2014a). Retrospective PCR analysis of samples submitted to the Iowa State University Diagnostic Laboratory for enteric disease revealed the presence of PDCoV as early as August 2013 (Sinha, Gauger, Zhang, Yoon, & Harmon, 2015). Antibody testing suggested an even earlier exposure of US swine to PDCoV, with samples from 2010 being positive for anti\u2010PDCoV IgG (Thachil, Gerber, Xiao, Huang, & Opriessnig, 2015).",

However, this number likely underestimates the true percentage of successful eradications as inherently fewer tests are used to confirm a negative result in those herds lacking clinical disease. Moreover, this underscores an important gap in knowledge for true prevalence throughout the United States due to inconsistent reporting as well as the percentage and protocols of herds with success in eradicating these pathogens after introduction.",

PED broke in Canada several months after its US introduction, with the first confirmed case in Ontario reported in January 2014 (Kochhar, 2014). Ojkic et al. (2015) described the initial PEDV outbreak in Canada as a rapidly spreading diarrhoeal disease non\u2010responsive to antimicrobial therapy with vomiting and 100% mortality in pigs less than 1 week of age in a farrow\u2010to\u2010finish swine herd (Ojkic et al., 2015). The Canadian PEDV isolate was >99% identical to the United States isolate (Pasick et al., 2014). With the benefit of the experience of PED in the United States, the Canadians (including swine veterinarians, producers and regulatory authorities) were better prepared and more able to contain the spread of the virus throughout the country. The source of the virus was linked to feed (Pasick et al., 2014; Pasma, Furness, Alves, & Aubry, 2016); the company recalled the feed, and the outbreak stopped spreading. Infected sites were voluntarily shut down, and regional spread was contained. There have been sporadic PED outbreaks primarily in Quebec and Ontario associated with trucks which have been quickly contained; the losses due to PED in Canada have been significantly less than those which have occurred in the United States. Most recently, there has been a PED outbreak in Manitoba that has spread through the local region, including 90 sites as of 7 November 2017 (Manitoba, 2017). The outbreak is expected to remain localized to this general area and thus far, 22 of the 90 outbreak sites are now presumed negative for PED.",

Production losses may be doubled for those herds infected in colder periods of the year compared to those initially exposed during warmer months (Goede & Morrison, 2016). Clinical disease and positive cases typically decline in late spring, summer and early fall. Infection of neonatal pigs usually results in significant mortality rates (approaching 100%), caused by malabsorptive diarrhoea and dehydration as a result of small intestinal enterocyte necrosis and villous atrophy (Figure 2). Infection of grow\u2010finish animals results in moderate morbidity but typically little to no mortality, with vomiting, lethargy and mild to moderate diarrhoea. Infections in adult swine may be inapparent due to minimal to no gastrointestinal signs; however, some sows and gilts may have mild diarrhoea, reduced activity and inappetance upon na\u00efve exposure.",

In 2\u2010 to 4\u2010day\u2010old pigs inoculated with PDCoV, emesis and diarrhoea were both noted by 2 days of post\u2010infection (dpi) coupled with moderate to severe dehydration and lethargy. Even a single day seemed to impact response to PDCoV in this study, where pigs inoculated at 2 days of age had a mortality rate of 50.1% compared to 21.5% mortality of pigs inoculated at 3 days of age (Vitosh\u2010Sillman et al., 2016). In 3\u2010 and 4\u2010week\u2010old pigs, emesis, although inconsistent among individual pigs, was the first clinical sign of PED between 2 and 3 dpi and may be considered as a potential first sign of exposure (Madson et al., 2014; Niederwerder et al., 2016).

In almost all experimental infection trials (Table 1), virus was detected prior to the initiation of clinical disease and well past resolution of clinical signs. For example, in weaned pigs at 3 and 4 weeks of age, PEDV shedding in faeces could be detected approximately 1 day prior to the development of clinical signs and 2\u20133 weeks after clinical disease abates (Madson et al., 2014; Niederwerder et al., 2016). Specifically, although 4\u2010week\u2010old pigs inoculated with PEDV had mostly resolved clinical disease by 8 dpi, viral shedding was detected until 28 dpi and the majority of pigs maintained PEDV in the small intestine until 42 dpi (Niederwerder et al., 2016). Similarly, 2\u2010 to 4\u2010day\u2010old pigs infected with PDCoV had resolved clinical disease by 12 dpi, but maintained faecal shedding until 21 dpi and still had virus detected in the small intestine until 42 dpi. Additionally, dams in this study maintained faecal shedding and PDCoV in the small intestine until 35 dpi, 26 days after resolution of clinical disease (Vitosh\u2010Sillman et al., 2016). In another study, 10\u2010day\u2010old piglets challenged with PDCoV had resolved clinical disease by 10 dpi and histopathologic lesions by 21 dpi; however, PDCoV RNA was still detectable in faeces, intestine and blood at 21 dpi when the study concluded (Ma et al., 2015). Prolonged PDCoV shedding has also been reported in 14\u2010day\u2010old gnotobiotic pigs after experimental infection (Hu, Jung, Vlasova, & Saif, 2016). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that pigs can shed low levels of virus for several weeks post\u2010infection and may harbour virus in the intestine for over 1 month after clinical disease subsides. Additionally, it is worth noting that virus was often detected at the conclusion of these studies post\u2010euthanasia and that the exact time period of viral persistence in tissues remains unknown. Moreover, diagnosing a true negative on faecal swabs is challenging due to a lack of viral shedding in some pigs harbouring virus in the intestine.",

Although PEDV\u2010infected animals had intermittent viral shedding through 42 dpi, na\u00efve sentinel pigs only became infected when introduced at 7 and 14 dpi, but not at later times (Crawford et al., 2015). This suggests that the presence of virus in the faeces and intestine several weeks after inoculation may not pose a risk for productive transmission. However, long\u2010term persistence of PEDV has been reported in the field (Park & Lee, 2009; Pijpers, van Nieuwstadt, Terpstra, & Verheijden, 1993), and healthy pigs should be considered as potential SECD carriers post\u2010exposure.

Viral detection in serum is more variable, with most suckling or nursery pigs developing a low\u2010level viremia during acute infection (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2014; Niederwerder et al., 2016). Dams infected with PDCoV or PEDV may fail to develop a detectable viremia. For example, suckling pigs infected with PDCoV had detectable viremia between 2 and 5 dpi, whereas infected dams lacked a detectable viremia (Vitosh\u2010Sillman et al., 2016). Oral fluids have also been shown to be a valuable tool for PCR surveillance of PEDV and PDCoV, maintaining positive results for approximately 4 weeks post\u2010infection (Niederwerder et al., 2016; Vitosh\u2010Sillman et al., 2016). Antibody detection may be used for herd surveillance but is less useful in acute diagnoses as antibody production is typically delayed, with the majority of pigs not seroconverting until at least two weeks post\u2010exposure (Niederwerder et al., 2016; Pasick et al., 2014). However, due to intermittent faecal shedding in more chronic or endemic infections, antibody testing may be more reliable to detect ongoing exposures within a herd.",

Goede and Morrison (2016) quantified the production impacts of PED through data collected from 429 exposed herds between April 2013 and July 2014 by the Swine Health Monitoring Project (SHMP). Based on this data, the mean time required to produce consistently negative piglets on PCR (as defined by four consecutive samples representing 30 or more litres) was 29.5 weeks after the outbreak. The median time to return to 100% of baseline production, as measured by the number of pigs weaned per week, was 21 weeks. Additionally, these authors noted that 6% of herds participating in the SHMP failed to return to 100% of baseline production approximately 1 year after exposure. These data provide evidence that production losses occur for several months after an acute outbreak and that for a small number of herds, decreased production may be long\u2010term, continuing for >1 year after the initial exposure (Goede & Morrison, 2016).",

Even though ADG was not significantly different between the two groups during any other time of the 6\u2010week study, body weight for the PEDV\u2010infected pigs was on average 6.5 kg less than the control pigs at 42 dpi (Curry et al., 2017). In growing pigs approximately 7 weeks of age, Schweer, Schwartz et al. (2016) compared the growth performance characteristics of pigs infected with PEDV alone, pigs infected with a combination of PEDV and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and uninfected controls. Infection with PEDV reduced the ADG of gilts compared to the controls by almost half (0.66 kg compared to 0.35 kg) over the 7 days of post\u2010infection. Interestingly, infection of pigs with PRRSV and PEDV in combination resulted in a greater reduction in ADG than with either singular infection, indicating the importance of co\u2010infections in the pathogenesis of both viruses (Schweer, Schwartz et al., 2016).",

A study performed by this group showed that PEDV remained viable on tote material for 35 days at room temperature (Scott et al., 2016). Further investigations into the epidemiologic link between PEDV and contaminated feed have demonstrated that PCR\u2010positive feed is not always infectious in a bioassay. For example, Bowman, Krogwold et al. (2015) investigated pelleted feed as a potential common source for PEDV introduction affecting multiple sites and various age groups within an Ohio swine operation. Although PEDV nucleic acid was detected in an unopened bag of feed used on the operation, the feed did not result in productive PEDV infection when fed to na\u00efve pigs for bioassay testing (Bowman, Krogwold et al., 2015). Similar results were described in Pasick et al. (2014) during an investigation into the route of PEDV introduction into Canada. Spray\u2010dried porcine plasma (SDPP) imported from the United States and the associated complete feed were found to contain low levels of PEDV nucleic acid on qPCR. However, only the PEDV\u2010positive SDPP was confirmed as infectious to 3\u2010week\u2010old pigs when orally administered for bioassay testing; inconclusive results were obtained for the contaminated complete feed. Furthermore, infection caused by the PEDV\u2010positive SDPP was transmissible to contact controls (Pasick et al., 2014). In contrast to these results, Opriessnig, Xiao, Gerber, Zhang, and Halbur (2014) found that PEDV\u2010contaminated SDPP did not result in productive transmission to 3\u2010week\u2010old pigs (Opriessnig et al., 2014).

Controlled exposure through feedback of infectious SECD in the form of faeces, ingesta or homogenized intestines is commonly used to simultaneously stimulate immunity in sows and replacement gilts through programs designed to \u201cload, close and expose\u201d the herd. Stimulating gastrointestinal immunity in sows and gilts through controlled exposure increases the beneficial lactogenic immunity through IgA in colostrum or milk consumed by neonatal pigs. Lactogenic immunity is critical for protecting piglets from the high morbidity and mortality of SECD and mitigating the significant losses that can occur within na\u00efve herds (Langel, Paim, Lager, Vlasova, & Saif, 2016).

The purpose of the survey was to compile information and opinions from stakeholders on the current SECD situation in the field. The survey allowed individuals to provide SECD information on up to five unique swine herds, including information on size, production type, location, SECD status and exposure, source of SECD introduction and methods for SECD control. Individuals were also asked to give their opinion on whether or not PEDV and PDCoV could be eradicated from the US swine population. Over a 4\u2010week period, 40 swine veterinarians and managers provided information on 83 swine herds. Summarized results are presented in Table 2.",

Approximately two\u2010thirds of the herds were located in swine\u2010dense regions and approximately 71% (59/83) of herds reported exposure to SECD. Perhaps the most interesting result of the survey was the low percentage of herds with active SECD infection (12/83; 14.5%). The remaining herds had either never been exposed to SECD (24/83; 28.9%) or had been exposed and had eliminated the virus without a recent reintroduction (47/83; 56.6%). Of the 59 herds reporting SECD exposure, the vast majority of these herds (50/59; 85%) reported exposure to PEDV alone, with only a minor population reporting PDCoV exposure either singularly (3/59; 5%) or in combination with PEDV (6/59; 10%). Taken together, these survey data suggest that most herds have had long\u2010term success in maintaining a negative status or eliminating PEDV after exposure. However, it is important to consider that the absence of SECD clinical signs and/or faecal shedding does not always translate to virus eradication. Underlying immunity may suppress clinical disease and to determine a truly negative status, it may be necessary to comingle na\u00efve animals into the herd or re\u2010test animals after stress, such as transportation.",

All six possible routes of introduction included in the survey were well represented in these herds; routes including trucks, feed and unknown (biosecurity protocols in place) comprised the majority of herds (53/72; 73.6%). Additionally, aerosols, neighbouring farms and other were possible routes that each garnered approximately 10% of the herd responses. The survey question addressing methods utilized for SECD control were also varied, and most herds utilized several strategies in combination. This question allowed multiple answers (select all that apply), and 77 herds were represented in the responses provided. The most commonly used practice selected was whole\u2010herd feedback through a load\u2010close\u2010expose protocol (59/77; 76.6%). Approximately one\u2010third of herds continued to use controlled exposure for gilt acclimation (23/77; 29.9%). With regard to vaccination, approximately 25% of herds reported to use either the killed (11/77; 14%) or replicon particle (8/77; 10%) vaccines. Neonatal pig management strategies, including early segregated weaning (22/77; 29%) and piglet depopulation (36/77; 47%), were also reported.

The appearance of these two viruses underscores the risk of other potential diseases being introduced into US and Canadian swine herds. Since SECD introduction, the United States has primarily focused on disease management with the number of positive cases and premises gradually declining each winter. In Canada, disease elimination has been the primary focus, and SECD has now been largely contained to a single province in the country. Nevertheless, several challenges have been encountered by both countries, such as continued virus introduction on new farms and long\u2010term shedding of exposed pigs. As demonstrated on the survey and by the Canadian experience, the success of eliminating these viruses in many herds post\u2010introduction provides hope for a potential future eradication from one or both countries; however, the cost of virus introduction into na\u00efve herds and the continued detection of new positive cases highlights the significant challenges that would be faced in a SECD elimination program.",
