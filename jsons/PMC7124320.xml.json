All serotypes in each genus are significant causes of acute respiratory illness (ARI), except for the adenoviruses, of which nine serotypes (1\u20137, 14, and 21) are important causes of ARI. A large number of other viruses can cause ARI or prominent respiratory symptoms; however, they are better known for other disease manifestations. These include many enteroviruses, measles virus, herpes simplex type 1 virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (the cause of infectious mononucleosis). In all, 20 distinct viruses plus >100 different rhinoviruses cause ARI in humans. This number of viruses\u2014along with the facts that reinfection may occur, other viruses can produce ARI, and a large portion of ARI cases presumed to be viral cannot be ascribed to a specific virus using current technology\u2014explains the high incidence of viral respiratory infections and illnesses in all human populations.",

They affect persons of all ages, but their incidence is higher among children than among adults. Infection may be asymptomatic or induce a severe and lethal infection. A variety of complications of viral respiratory infection have been described; most notable are secondary bacterial infections causing otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia. In these cases, a respiratory virus infection impairs the defense mechanisms that keep these anatomic sites free from infection with bacteria. Among the other described complications are post-infectious encephalitis, the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Reyes syndrome after influenza in children, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with influenza.",

A combined nasal wash and throat swab specimen was tested for virus as described previously.[2] A total of 668 illness episodes were sampled for virus: 235 isolates were obtained from sampling of 223 illness episodes; >1 virus was isolated for 12 episodes. Thus, 33.4% of respiratory illness episodes in these mostly hospitalized patients yielded a virus. When herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus isolations were excluded, 181 (27.1%) episodes were virus positive; two episodes yielded two respiratory viruses. It should be emphasized that 27.1% represents a minimal estimate of the frequency of infection with a respiratory virus among these patients with an ARI, since serology was not done and repeat sampling was minimal.",

These infections will have been acquired from an infected person. This could be another ill patient, but most cases are probably acquired from exposure to an infected person with little or no illness who brings the virus into the hospital. Hospital personnel, including doctors and nurses, have been identified as probable sources; visitors, particularly children who exhibit high infection frequencies, are an alternative source. A major contributing factor to these infection frequencies is the prolonged stay that is characteristic of hospitalized patients who are immunocompromised.",

Moreover, the apparent value of early aerosol ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) therapy for RSV reduced the overall frequencies for that virus.[8] The role of the virus infection in causing the pneumonia and death is uncertain in many of these patients, who frequently have multiple infections.

A variety of nonspecific defenses contribute to resistance to infection and recovery from infection. These defenses include the mucous layer covering the respiratory mucosa, fever, the inflammatory response, \u03b1 and \u03b2 interferon, and nonspecifically activated phagocytes. The primary defense against acquisition of a specific virus is antibody to that virus, whereas the primary mechanisms for recovery are both humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated immune responses. Current information indicates that the primary immunoglobulin and antibody in the upper respiratory passage is polymeric IgA that is formed locally in submucosal tissues in response to antigen and transported across epithelial cells into upper respiratory secretions.[23] With descent into the lower respiratory passage, the proportion of 7s IgG in secretions increases, as does the proportion of 7s IgG antibody.[24] This antibody is derived primarily from serum. Thus, following infection, the major antibody protecting the nasopharynx is considered to be IgA, whereas that protecting the lower respiratory passages is IgG. Both types of antibody can, however, be present at both sites, and both antibody types are desirable for optimal protection against a specific virus.",

Specific antibodies that are induced may contribute to virus elimination in a variety of ways, including aggregation for clearance, opsonization, and early lysis of infected cells; lysis may be complement mediated or represent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The major specific cell-mediated immune response promoting recovery is CD8 T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. This mechanism has been shown to be of major importance in myxovirus and paramyxovirus infections in animal models.25, 26\n",

These patients exhibit B lymphocyte impairment manifested by a reduced ability of B cells to respond to stimulatory cytokines, such as IL-4, reduced serum immunoglobulin levels, and depressed primary and secondary responses to antigens. Deficiencies in T cell function are indicated by reduced CD4 lymphocyte and CD4/CD8 cell ratios, reduced T helper cell and increased suppressor cell activity, reduced proliferative responses, reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, and reduced CD8 lymphocyte cytotoxic function. Reduced neutrophil numbers and function are of major importance for the occurrence and control of bacterial infection; but, except for an ability to mediate ADCC, no role for neutrophils in defense against these virus infections has been suggested.",

Although increased susceptibility to infection in immunocompromised patients has not been proven, Kempe et al[28] reported an increased rate of influenza virus infection among immunocompromised children compared with an immunocompetent population. Of interest is the finding that the increase was accounted for primarily by infection among those with preexisting serum antibody. A deficiency in new antibody synthesis induced by infection would lead to increased susceptibility to reinfection. Reduced T lymphocyte numbers and function with reductions in T cell cytotoxic function would lead to reduced ability to clear virus, with a resulting increase in both magnitude and duration of infection. An increased magnitude of infection would lead to an increased likelihood of viral pneumonia as well as secondary bacterial or fungal pneumonias that occur because of impairment of antimicrobial defenses by both the immune deficiency and the viral infection.",

            "text": "It is becoming increasingly clear that the respiratory viruses commonly infect immunocompromised persons and that these infected persons may exhibit severe respiratory illnesses with high frequencies of pneumonia and death. Although not well documented, there is surely a gradient of infection and illness severity that relates to the degree and type of impairment of immune function. It is not clear at present that impairment of immune function can lead to increased susceptibility to infection, although early data suggest this is true and described immune impairments would make this likely. On the other hand, there is little doubt that severe pure viral pneumonias and the characteristic prolonged infections that occur in immunocompromised patients are attributable to deficiencies in mechanisms of recovery. The severity of RSV infections in patients with extreme degrees of immunodeficiency is notable; an understanding of the immune basis for this severity could aid in designing immune approaches for prevention and treatment of these infections. Similarly, such an understanding of the other respiratory viral infections could be of value in the care not only of immunocompromised persons but also of immunocompetent persons.",

It is not clear at present whether the most significant role of respiratory viral infection in the pneumonias is as a primary pathogen, a contributing pathogen, or a pathogen predisposing to secondary infection with bacteria or fungi that then cause pneumonia. The last of these\u2014their role as predisposing pathogens\u2014is considered to be the major role for these infections among immunocompetent patients who develop pneumonia. Options are available for control of some of the respiratory viral infections, and efforts to recognize and apply these options are needed while other options are being identified and developed. Perhaps the greatest need at present, however, is for practicing physicians to appreciate the role that respiratory viral infection can play as a cause of serious disease in immunocompromised patients.",
