SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse such diseases based on a mathematical model. After an outbreak of SARS, the first SIR model of SARS was published and many researchers studied the epidemic of the disease using this model. When an outbreak of a new type of influenza is first reported, the U.S. government immediately starts an emergency action plan to estimate parameters of its SIR model. Nevertheless the SIR model has difficulty to analyse which measures are effective because the model has only one parameter to represent infectiveness. For example, it is difficult for the SIR model to evaluate the effect of temporary closing of classes because of the influenza epidemic. The agent-based approach or the individual-based approach has been adopted to conquer these problems in recent years [1\u20134]. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model.",

This model was designed as an agent-based model, and then simulation of infectious disease was conducted using the model. As results of experiments showed that (1) in a base model in which any infectious disease measures were not taken, the epidemic spread within 82 days and 30 % of people died, (2) a trace vaccination measure was effective but it was difficult to trace all contacts to patients in an underground railway or an airport, (3) a mass vaccination measure was effective, but the number of vaccinations would be huge so it was not realistic, (4) epidemic quenching was also effective, and reactive household trace vaccination along with pre-emptive vaccination of hospital workers showed a dramatic effect.",

In the model, one person was infected with smallpox virus at a shopping mall. They compared between a trace vaccination measure and a mass vaccination measure. As a result of simulation, it was found that the effect of trace vaccination dropped if the early stage of infection was high and the number of medical staff is small, while the effect of mass vaccination was stable. Therefore timely and concentrate mass vaccination is required when virus starts spreading. The estimation about the number, place and time of infection is needed quickly and the preparation of an emergency medical treatment and estimation system is required for such occasions.",

As a result of experiments, it has been found that vaccination availability per day and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread for the mass vaccination strategy. On the other hand, small quantities of vaccination for approximately 10 % of inhabitants are vaccinated per day are able to control an epidemic in most cases.
