Like many calf rearers purchasing young calves, this farmer did not have control over the first 7 days of their lives. Focus therefore was on treatment of sick animals, reducing the risk of spread of pathogens and diagnostic testing to aid management. Longer term an all-in all-out programme followed by disinfection, and a review of purchasing policy to help selection of source farms was established. ",

The majority of calves were purchased at 7 days of age, but a group of ten, from 7 days to 7 weeks were purchased from one farm into the current batch. Mixing of age groups is not ideal and will increase the risks of spreading disease from older to younger animals in the group. It was advised to purchase from as few farms as possible, and to ensure all animals were of a similar age. An all-in and all-out policy with a more consistent group would allow better management.",

This is a serious difficulty in any calf-rearing enterprise where newborn calf management is out of the purchaser's control. Young, stressed calves mixing with others from different sources increases the risk of disease, but with an inadequate immune status they are at an even greater risk. As calves usually arrived at 7 days of age, there is the opportunity in future of blood sampling on arrival to assess passive transfer from colostrum. Calves with a total protein >5.2 g/dl have adequate passive transfer (Weaver et al, 2000) . Those calves with adequate passive transfer demonstrate better management on the farm of origin and so improved performance for the purchaser. This will also allow improved selection of source farms. Purchasing calves from farms that demonstrate effective control of neonatal disease such as Rotavirus, Coronavirus, E. coli K99 and Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) will further minimise risk. Many calf purchasers will be prepared to pay a premium for animals of known health and vaccination status, and this should encourage calf producers to produce these animals. ",

Calves had clean, fresh, straw bedding, fresh water and pellets in front of them at all times ( Figure 4 ) plus clean straw in racks as a source of roughage ( Figure 5 ). Each received 2 litres of milk per feed; this was bucket fed and made up from a skimmed milk powder twice daily. Weaning was to take place at 8 weeks of age when a calf was eating more than 1 kg pellets a day. Nose to nose contact was possible between pens ( Figure 6 ) and so therefore was the transmission of infectious enteritis. A solid divider between pens to reduce this risk was recommended.

The immediate priority was to formalise a treatment programme for diarrhoeic calves. This had to be straightforward and clearly explained to the farmer so he understood not only how, but why calves were treated. The next step was to improve hygiene and cleanliness. To limit faecal transmission by minimising contact of the farmer with calves -by bedding up from outside pens and minimising contact of calves with each other -with the use of solid dividers between pens. Many husbandry measures will reduce the risk of diarrhoea and such measures carry little in the way of additional costs. Control focuses on reducing exposure to the infectious agents and optimising the calves' resistance to them (Mason et al, 2012) .",
