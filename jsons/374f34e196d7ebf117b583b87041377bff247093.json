She had been treated at a dental clinic 3 days prior (Day -3) and given antibiotics (cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate) and the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) loxoprofen sodium hydrate. Erythematous lesions and erosions on the lips appeared 2 days later (Day -1). Her blood counts were normal. The skin lesions were clinically diagnosed as a drug eruption (Day 0). Pathologic analysis of a skin biopsy sample obtained from an indurated erythematous lesion (Fig 1) (Fig 1) . The biopsy specimen was taken from an indurated erythematous lesion on her abdominal skin. Pathologic analysis revealed interface changes with liquefaction and perivascular mixed cell infiltrations including histiocytes and neutrophils in the papillary dermis (Fig 2 CD) . The ampicillin/sulbactam was changed to levofloxacin. On Day 10, the erythematous lesions peaked and gradually pigmented. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for COVID-19 on Day 1 of admission was negative, but CT showed progression of the ground glass opacity.",

COVID-19 is associated with drug eruptions, but the details remain unclear [2, 3] . Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) have been self-reported by several patients. Drug eruption might not be merely incidental, but possibly related to COVID-19-induced cytokine storm with Th17 dysregulation [4] . NSAIDs may exacerbate symptoms of COVID-19, but no evidence has yet been provided [5] . Drug hypersensitivity may be due to aggravated inflammation. Drug eruption caused by NSAIDs preceding other symptoms of COVID-19 may facilitate early diagnosis based on specific features. In this case, the macular papule lesions and pathologic findings might be unique after exacerbations with COVID-19. Interface changes with liquefaction and perivascular mixed cell infiltrations in the papillary dermis are observed. There are histiocytic infiltrations around the capillary vessels and neutrophils are scattered in the upper dermis (Fig 2 CD) . The bar is indicated size as appears.",

Deep lymphocytic infiltrations are not typical for drug eruptions. Lymphocyte stimulation tests were performed for cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate (stimulation index [SI]: 151%)and loxoprofen sodium hydrate (SI: 300%). Oral prednisolone (20 mg/day) was started immediately to treat oral lesion worsening. On Day 2, well-demarcated infiltrated erythema was observed on her trunk. The erosions of her lower lips and buccal mucosa gradually improved. The prednisolone was reduced to 10 mg/day. Five days after decreasing the prednisolone (Day 7), she returned to our clinic with high fever, cough, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath. She reported no travel history, but worked at a healthcare facility for elderly people. Computed tomography (CT) revealed slight ground glass opacity in the lower lung lobes. Blood tests revealed a high white blood cell count (22,300/\uf06dl) with lymphocytopenia (490/\uf06dl) and increased neutrophils (20,449/\uf06dl), high C-reactive protein (12\u00b78 mg/dl), and normal lactic acid dehydrogenase (196 U/L).
