Human population growth has negatively impacted both these requirements, resulting in a decline in all felid species worldwide in range and number. Felidae are among the most threatened groups of mammals. Larger species are heavily persecuted because of the danger they pose to humans and livestock. Small cat species are also persecuted and are harvested for the fur trade. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List designates 29 of 36 wild felid species as having a decreasing population trend. Nearly 50% of all felid species are listed in the top three threatened categories, and seven of these species are listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered. Felids characterized as threatened are those that appear to be naturally rare with limited distribution or those that have become threatened because of human factors. The Iberian lynx, listed as Critically Endangered, fits into both categories and may become the first cat species to become extinct in modern times.23, 31\n",

There are 28 or 30 teeth with the following dental formula: incisors (I) 3/3, canines (C) 1/1, premolars (P) 2-3/2, molars (M) 1/1. The incisors are small and are used for nipping flesh from carcasses. Canines are long with a length-wise groove in the enamel and are used to kill prey. The fourth upper premolars (carnassial teeth) are used to slice meat. The reduced dentition allows for a reduced length of the skull and mandibles, which improves efficiency of the muscles that close the jaw. Cats have a more powerful bite relative to muscle mass than any other carnivore except mustelids. Because of their carnivorous diet, cats have a shorter digestive tract with a smaller cecum and a short large intestine.31\n",

Cats are digitigrade, with five toes in the front and four in the back. The first digit on the front foot is the dewclaw.

Conversely, the bony hyoid of the small cats was thought to allow them to purr but not roar. More recent studies comparing the hyoid structure and vocal abilities dispute this correlation. It has been found that the main difference between the roaring, nonpurring cats and the others was the presence of long, fleshy, elastic vocal folds within the larynx of big cats that resonate to produce a roar. Smaller cats and cheetahs have simpler vocal folds that only allow purring.31\n",

Diets should be developed on the basis of the recommendations of nutritionists such as the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Nutrition Group or the Association of Zoos and Aquarium (AZA) Nutrition Advisory Group (NAG). The AZA-NAG feeding program guidelines suggest a feeding strategy that includes providing a diet that is nutritionally balanced, that reasonably stimulates natural feeding behaviors, that the animal consumes consistently, and that meets the above criteria and is practical and economical to feed. Domestic cats generally require 80 to 90 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight (BW) per day (kcal/kg/day) to meet metabolic requirements. Diet quantity needs to be altered on the basis of the animal's body condition, life stage, and environmental factors. Amounts of feed may also be based on the National Research Council recommendation of 55 to 260 kcal/BW0.75 (Requirements for Domestic Dogs and Cats, National Research Council [NRC], 2006).",

If muscle meats or organ meats make up the bulk of the diet, additional supplementation, including calcium, may be necessary. The majority of felids are able to handle the large concentrations of microorganisms present in raw meat. However, guidelines of appropriate bacterial concentrations in received commercial products need to be established for each institution, and commercial products should be tested on a regular basis.

These drugs may be antagonized with yohimbine (0.04 to 0.3 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg], intramuscularly [IM] or intravenously [IV; slow]), atipamezole (0.1 to 0.45 mg/kg, IM), naltrexone (0.05\u20130.25 mg/kg, IM or IV), and flumazenil (0.01\u20130.02 mg/kg, IV or IM).

It is also very important to limit exposure of captive felids to feral and domestic cats and dogs, free-living carnivores, bats, rodents, and other small mammals. The common viral diseases in felids are summarized in Table 47-4\n. Helicobacter gastritis may be a significant bacterial infection that results in regurgitation, vomiting, weight loss, and ill thrift. Although all felids may be affected, the clinical disease is most often observed in cheetahs. Management of this condition is well documented in the literature. Additional bacterial diseases include those caused by Mycoplasma spp. and Chlamydophila psittaci, which are part of the feline respiratory disease complex, and enterocolitis caused by Campylobacter spp. Salmonella spp. may cause disease but is often passed in the feces of asymptomatic animals secondary to a raw food diet. All felids are susceptible to infections by dermatophytes, especially Microsporum canis and M. gypseum. Treatment with griseofulvin resulted in toxicity with bone marrow suppression and death in cheetahs.36 Coccidioidomycosis (caused by Coccidioides immitis) has been reported in nondomestic felids in regions of the world where this pathogenic fungus resides in the soil (southwestern United States and northern Mexico). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been reported in felids in Europe.27 The cats had been fed cattle carcasses or animal products, including blood and bone meal produced in BSE endemic areas.",

Prophylactic treatment of breeding animals and neonates is recommended. Cytauxzoon felis is a protozoan that infects blood cells.4, 12, 24, 41 It is transmitted by the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). The natural reservoir is the bobcat that becomes a persistent carrier after developing mild or subclinical infection. The disease may be fatal in untreated domestic cats, and a fatal infection in a white tiger has been reported. Babesia felis, originally identified in wild cats from Sudan, has been reported sporadically from various countries.1, 4, 20, 24, 41 South Africa appears to be the only country where feline babesiosis is a significant clinical entity. The infection is assumed to be tickborne, but the vector has not been identified. Concurrent infections may contribute to clinical disease. Ascarids (Toxocara and Toxascaris) are common in captive animals and may be difficult to eliminate. The ova are highly resistant in the environment. Repeated testing and treatment of animals while in quarantine may prevent the introduction of ascarids into exhibits. In chronically infected cats, routine treatment may be needed to limit worm burdens.

            "text": "Vaccination protocols for carnivores have been recently reviewed.17 Vaccines recommended are divided into core vaccines (recommended for all felids) and noncore vaccines (optional, depending on the specific disease risk of the species and institution, not generally recommended). Vaccine-associated sarcomas have rarely been reported in nondomestic felids. Because of the lack of serologic studies and difficulty in performing challenge experiments on nondomestic felids, specific information on the length of protection from vaccination is lacking. Specific recommendations for vaccination frequency cannot be made, although most institutions vaccinate adults every 1 to 3 years using the core vaccines. Core vaccines include rabies (killed, e.g., Imrab 3, Merial; or recombinant canarypox-vectored, e.g., PureVax Rabies, Merial) and feline panleukopenia, calicivirus, herpesvirus (killed, e.g., Fel-O-Vax PCT Plus, Boehringer Ingelheim). Noncore vaccines that should be considered only in species at risk include canine distemper virus (CDV) (recombinant canarypox-vectored, PureVax Ferret Distemper, Merial) and FeLV (killed).",
