Afterward, as an epidemic illness, the coronavirus disease spread swiftly to other provinces of China (Abdi, 2020). Finally, COVID-19 crossed the boundaries of China and spread to all regions of the world (Faridi et al., 2020). The data of the World Health Organization (WHO) show that from 22 January 2020 to 10 April 2020, almost 1.7 million coronavirus cases have been identified with over 100,000 cases of deaths and 377,000 cases of recovery all over the world (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). This robust transmission rate of the coronavirus disease has led to the substitution of the epithet \u2018epidemic\u2019 with \u2018pandemic\u2019 in the description of this disease (Layne et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).",

Based on the latest epidemiological researches and laboratory studies (Dalziel et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2005; Tosepu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2006; Zhu and Xie, 2020), the ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as the crucial transmissibility factors. For instance, the AT and PS parameters could increase or decrease the transmissibility risk and survival period of coronavirus in the air and on surfaces. Hence, the sensitivity analyses of AT and PS parameters on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus is immensely crucial for improving the safety and survival of mankind. The analysis of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This research intends to examine the sensibility of AT and the sensitivity of PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. To this end, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are collected. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS parameters are performed.",

The AUC of an ideal model is near 1 which means that it can measure separability in the best way possible. Conversely, the AUC of an imperfect model is near 0 which implies that it can measure separability in the worst way possible. At P1, the threshold is more than one and only FN and TN are activated. Reciprocally, at P2, the threshold is less than zero and only TP and FP are activated. In the ROC curve, P3 which is called the optimum or cut-off point has the minimum distance from the point (0, 1). This point is considered as the boundary of high (A1) and low (A2) sensitive regions (G\u00f6nen, 2007).",

The AUC of the AT model is approximately 0.5. It can be observed that the AT model has no capacity to distinguish between positive and negative classes. Moreover, it can be seen that the behavior of the AT model is similar to that of an imperfect model which indicates that the AT model does not have a high performance. As marked in Fig. 6, the accurate coordinates of the cut-off or optimum point are P3 (0.486, 0.505). The cut-off point confirms that the spread level of coronavirus in provinces with a temperature of less than 17 \u00b0C is slightly more than that of the other provinces. It can be concluded that the transmission rate of coronavirus does not have a high sensibility versus the AT parameter in different provinces of Iran since the AT parameter has a linear relationship with the number of people afflicted with COVID-19. Therefore, there is no scientific reason to assume that the number of people afflicted with COVID-19 in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.",

In contrast to the AT model, the PS model has a nonlinear behavior which indicates that it has a higher sensitivity than the AT model.
