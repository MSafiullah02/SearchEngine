            "text": "Heart transplantation (HTx) is still the gold standard for the treatment of chronic heart failure, improving not only the survival but also the quality of life of these patients [1]. The administration of an immunosuppressive treatment is essential to prevent rejection, but these therapies expose the HTx recipient to infectious bacterial, viral and fungal complications [2]. Thus, during the first year following HTx, postoperative infections represent the main cause of death in HTx recipients [3]. In cardiac surgery, POP is still the most common infectious complication [4] and is known to be associated with increased mortality [5, 6]. After HTx, the incidence and risk factors for POP remain poorly investigated [7\u201310]. In addition, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) used to prevent antibody-mediated rejection in sensitized recipients may also influence the occurrence of POP after HTx [11\u201313]. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for POP in HTx recipients, with or without preformed donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (pfDSA).",

Prophylactic immunosuppressive therapy included calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids with posology recommended by ISHLT guidelines [14]. In cases of pfDSA, a prophylactic protocol including perioperative management of pfDSA and systematic treatment of subsequent antibody-mediated rejection was applied to patients transplanted with pfDSA. Perioperative management was adapted to the results of the virtual cross-match and to the level of the pfDSA, as evaluated by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the immunodominant pfDSA (i.e., DSA with the highest MFI) as follows: (1) patients with MFI 500\u20131000 were treated with IVIg (0.5 g\u00b7kg\u2212 1 over 4 consecutive days, total dose of 2 g\u00b7kg\u2212 1; Privigen; CSL Behring AG, Bern, Switzerland), (2) patients with MFI > 1000 were treated with perioperative plasmapheresis sessions (immediately before the HTx, then with 4 sessions over 4 consecutive days using 2/3 fresh frozen plasma and 1/3 albumin, and a fibrinogen substitution was used if the serum fibrinogen < 2 g\u00b7L\u2212 1) and IVIg. Initiation of the protocol was based on the detection of pfDSA in historical sera. The treatment was readjusted 2 to 3 days after the HTx according to the MFI results at the time of HTx [13]. .Intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis consisted of the administration of 2 g of cefazolin followed by an additional 1 g every 4 h. Antibiotic prophylaxis was not continued postoperatively. Prophylaxis with valganciclovir and cotrimoxazole was introduced postoperatively from the 6th postoperative day.",

The diagnosis of herpes virus pneumonia was based on the presence of more than 10,000 copies\u00b7mL\u2212 1 of the virus and evidence of a cytopathogenic effect on the anatomopathological investigation obtained by the bronchoalveolar lavage. The presence of Candida was considered pathological only if it was associated with lung abscesses. A POP diagnosis was retrospectively confirmed by 2 independent investigators (CV, RP) following analysis of the complete medical file, as previously reported [4]. Recurrent pneumonia was defined by the recurrence of clinical and paraclinical criteria of POP after the improvement of the first POP symptoms with an appropriate antibiotic therapy.",

However, although both of these reports concern infectious events in immunocompromised patients, there are not focused solely on the early postoperative period. In our cohort, almost all of the POP cases were bacterial. Community germs (Oropharyngeal flora, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Staphylococcus aureus) were responsible for only a small proportion of pneumonia (10%), and the most frequently implicated organisms in POP were Enterobacteriaceae (53%) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%). Such a microbiology of POP pathogens is similar to the one observed following other cardiac surgeries [6]. .This point should be considered when choosing the appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia in HTx recipients within the perioperative period. Infections with \u201copportunistic\u201d pathogens were rare (3 pulmonary aspergillosis, 1 pulmonary abscess with C. albicans and 3 HSV pneumonias) and appeared late in the infectious history and mainly in the patients with recurrent pneumonia.

Based on the institutional protocol, all patients with VA-ECMO (whether or not in a transplant project) are extubated as soon as possible to prevent the risk of pneumonia and ICU weakness. Early extubation allows neurological evaluation and participation in physiotherapy to select the best candidates for transplant projects. Thus, unlike the international registries, the use of VA-ECMO before transplantation did not appear to be a risk factor for POP in our study [3].

A transfusion in patients supported with VA-ECMO is also known to increase infectious complications [26]. In the present study, beyond the risk associated with low cardiac output and surgical reoperation itself, 34% of HTx recipients received a postoperative transfusion despite a restrictive strategy of blood transfusion in our institution, thereby increasing the risk of postoperative pneumonia.

However, the proportion of sensitized recipients is increasing, possibly because the technological means to detect pfDSA are evolving. Third, the proportion of HTx recipients assisted with postoperative VA-ECMO support is coherent in this study. Due to the rarity of heart grafts and to the graft distribution prioritization programme, the number of primary graft dysfunctions as well as the preoperative severity of recipients is increasing. Nevertheless, our study provides important information on this type of population.",
