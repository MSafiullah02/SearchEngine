This novel H1N1 strain was quickly termed \u201cswine flu\u201d, in reference to its alleged origin in pig populations before jumping the species border to humans. Very quickly public health institutions were alerted and saw the risk of this local influenza epidemic becoming a major public health problem globally. The concerns were serious because this influenza strain was of the H1N1 subtype, the same virus family that caused one of the biggest pandemics in history, the Spanish flu that killed up to 40 million people in the beginning of the 20th century [2]. The swine flu epidemic did indeed develop into a pandemic, spreading across the globe in matters of months. Luckily, the strain turned out to be comparatively mild in terms of symptoms and as a health hazard. Nevertheless, the concept of emergent infectious diseases, novel diseases that may have dramatic public health, societal and economic consequences reached a new level of public awareness. Even Hollywood picked up the topic in a number of blockbuster movies in the following years [3]. Only a few years later, MERS hit the news, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a new type of virus that infected people in the Middle East [4]. MERS was caused by a new species of corona virus of the same family of viruses that the 2003 SARS virus belonged to. And finally, the 2013 Ebola crisis in West African countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea that although it did not develop into a global crisis killed more than 10000 people in West Africa [5].",

Humanity, however, underwent major changes along many dimensions during the last century. The world population has increased from approx. 1.6 billion in 1900 to 7.5 billion in 2016 [7]. The majority of people now live in so-called mega-cities, large scale urban conglomerations of more than 10 million inhabitants that live in high population densities [8] often in close contact with animals, pigs and fowl in particular, especially in Asia. These conditions amplify not only the transmission of novel pathogens from animal populations to human, high frequency human-to-human contacts yield a potential for rapid outbreaks of new pathogens.\n",

            "text": "Population density is only one side of the coin. In addition to increasing face-to-face contacts within populations we also witness a change of global connectivity [9]. Most large cities are connected by means of an intricate, multi-scale web of transportation links, see Fig. 19.1. On a global scale worldwide air- transportation dominates this connectivity. Approx. 4,000 airports and 50,000 direct connections span the globe. More than three billion passengers travel on this network each year. Every day the passengers that travel this network accumulate a total of more than 14 billion kilometers, which is three times the radius of our solar system [10, 11]. Clearly this amount of global traffic shapes the way emergent infectious diseases can spread across the globe. One of the key challenges in epidemiology is preparing for eventual outbreaks and designing effective control measures. Evidence based control measures, however, require a good understanding of the fundamental features and characteristics of spreading behavior that all emergent infectious diseases share. In this context this means addressing questions such as: If there is an outbreak at location X when should one expect the first case at a distant location Y? How many cases should one expect there? Given a local outbreak, what is the risk that a case will be imported in some distant country. How does this risk change over time? Also, emergent infectious diseases often spread in a covert fashion during the onset of an epidemic. Only after a certain number of cases are reported, public health scientists, epidemiologist and other professionals are confronted with cases that are scattered across a map and it is difficult to determine the actual outbreak origin. Therefore, a key question is also: Where is the geographic epicenter of an ongoing epidemic?",

Figure 19.3a illustrates the time course of the lattice-SIR model. Seeded with a localized patch of infected sites, the system exhibits an asymptotic concentric wave front that progresses at an overall constant speed if the ratio of transmission and recovery rate is sufficiently large. Without the stochastic effects that yield the irregular interface at the infection front, this system exhibits similar properties to the reaction diffusion system of Eq. (19.7). In both systems transmission of the disease in space is spatially restricted per unit time.\n",

The propensity of infecting a lattice site at distance r decreases as an inverse power-law as explained in the caption to Fig. 19.3. The possibility of transmitting to distant locations yields new epidemic seeds far away that subsequently turn into new outbreak waves and that in turn seed second, third, etc. generation outbreaks, even if the overall rate at which long-distance transmission occur is very small. The consequence of this is that the spatially coherent, concerntric pattern observed in the reaction diffusion system is lost, and a complex spatially incoherent, fractal pattern emerges [16\u201318]. Practically, this implies that the distance from an initial outbreak location can no longer be used as a measure for estimating or computing the time that it takes for an epidemic to arrive at a certain location. Also, given a snapshot of a spreading pattern, it is much more difficult to reconstruct the outbreak location from the geometry of the pattern alone, unlike in the concentric system where the outbreak location is typically near the center of mass of the pattern.\n",

As a consequence we can no longer use geographic distance to an emergent epidemic epicenter as an indicator or measure of \u201chow far away\u201d that epicenter is and how long it will take to travel to a given location on the globe. This type of decorrelation is shown in Fig. 19.4 for two examples: The 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic. On a spatial resolution of countries, the figure depicts scatter plots of the epidemic arrival time as a function of geodesic (shortest distance on the surface of the Earth) distance from the initial outbreak location. As expected, the correlation between distance and arrival time is weak.",

(19.12) is one of the most parsimoneous models that accounts for strongly heterogeneous population distributions that are coupled by traffic flux between them and that can be gauged against actual population size distributions and traffic data. Surprisingly, despite its structural simplicity this type of model has been quite successful in accounting for actual spatial spreads of past epi- and pandemics [19]. Based on early models of this type and aided by the exponential increase of computational power, very sophisticated models have been developed that account for factors that are ignored by the deterministic metapopulation SIR model. In the most sophisticated approaches, e.g. GLEAM [21], the global epidemic and mobility computational tool, not only traffic by air but other means of transportation are considered, more complex infectious dynamics is considered and in hybrid dynamical systems stochastic effects caused by random reactions and mobility events are taken into account. Household structure, available hospital beds, seasonality have been incorporated as well as disease specific features, all in order to make predictions more and more precise. The philosophy of this type of research line heavily relies on the increasing advancement of both computational power as well as more accurate and pervasive data often collected in natural experiments and webbased techniques [21\u201325].",

First, with increasing computational methods it has become possible to implement extremely complex dynamical systems with decreasing effort and also without substantial knowledge of the dynamical properties that often nonlinear dynamical systems can possess. Implementing a lot of dynamical detail, it is difficult to identify which factors are essential for an observed phenomenon and which factors are marginal. Because of the complexity that is often incorporated even at the beginning of the design of a sophisticated model in combination with the lack of data modelers often have to make assumptions about the numerical values of parameters that are required for running a computer simulation [26]. Generically many dozens of unknown parameters exist for which plausible and often not evidence-based values have to be assumed. Because complex computational models, especially those that account for stochasticity, have to be run multiple times in order to make statistical assessments, systematic parameter scans are impossible even with the most sophisticated supercomputers.",

Although some computational models have been quite successful in describing and reproducing the spreading behavior of past epidemics and in situations where disease specific parameters and outbreak locations have been assessed, they are difficult to apply in situations when novel pathogens emerge. In these situations, when computational models from a practical point of view are needed most, little is known about these parameters and running even the most sophisticated models \u201cin the dark\u201d is problematic. The same is true for fixing the right initial conditions. In many cases, an emergent infectious disease initially spreads unnoticed and the public becomes aware of a new event after numerous cases occur in clusters at different locations. Reconstructing the correct initial condition often takes time, more time than is usually available for making accurate and valueable predictions that can be used by public health workers and policy makers to devise containment strategies.",

In essence the idea is very simple: If two locations in the air-transportation network exchange a large number of passengers they should be effectively close because a larger number of passengers implies that the probability of an infectious disease to be transmitted from A to B is comparatively larger than if these two locations were coupled only by a small number of traveling passengers. Effective distance should therefore decrease with traffic flux. What is the appropriate mathematical relation and a plausible ansatz to relate traffic flux to effective distance?

For example if shortly after an epidemic outbreak the spreading commences and the initial spreading speed is assessed, one can forecast arrival times without having to run computationally expensive simulations.

When cases emerge at apparently randomly distributed locations it is a difficult task to assess where the event initially started. The computational method based on effective distance can also be employed in these situations provided that one knows the underlying mobility network. This is because the concentric pattern depicted in Fig. 19.10 is only observed if and only if the actual outbreak location is chosen as the center perspective node. In other words, if the temporal snapshots are depicted using a different reference node the concentric pattern is scrambled and irregular. Therefore, one can use the effective distance method to identify the outbreak location of a spreading process based on a single temporal snapshot. This method is illustrated in a proof-of-concept example depicted in Fig. 19.12. Assume that we are given a temporal snapshot of a spreading process as depicted in Fig. 19.12a and the goal is to reconstruct the outbreak origin from the data. Conventional geometric considerations are not sucessful because the network-driven processes generically do not yields simple geometric patterns. Using effective distance, we can now investigate the pattern from the perspective of every single potential outbreak location. We could for example pick a set of candidate outbreak locations (panel (b) in the figure). If this is done we will find that only for one candidate outbreak location the temporal snapshot has the shape of a concentric circle. This must be the original outbreak location. This process, qualitatively depicted in the figure, can be applied in a quantitative way and has been applied to actual epidemic data such as the 2011 EHEC outbreak in Germany [28].\n",

We are connected by complex networks of interaction, mobility being only one of them. With the onset of social media, the internet and mobile devices we share information that proliferates and spreads on information networks in much the same way (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-67798-9_20). In all of these systems the scientific challenge is understanding what topological and statistical features of the underlying network shape particular dynamic features observed in natural systems. The examples addressed above focus on a particular scale, defined by a single mobility network, the air-transportation network that is relevant for this scale. As more and more data accumulates, computational models developed in the future will be able to integrate mobility patterns at an individual resolution, potentially making use of pervasive data collected on mobile devices and paving the way towards predictive models that can account very accurately for observed contagion patterns. The examples above also illustrate that just feeding better and faster computers with more and more data may not necessarily help understanding the fundamental processes and properties of the processes that underly a specific dynamic phenomenon. Sometimes we only need to change the conventional and traditional ways of looking at patterns and adapt our viewpoint appropriately.",
