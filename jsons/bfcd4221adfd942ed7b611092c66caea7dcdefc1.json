            "text": "Central nervous system dysfunction is a well recognised but uncommon postoperative complication following attenuation of extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in dogs (reviewed by Tisdall and others 2000) and cats (van Gundy and others 1990, Levy and others 1995) , but often is not associated with biochemical evidence of metabolic encephalopathies. A range of signs from ataxia and behavioural changes to generalised motor seizures and status epilepticus has been reported Hughes 1999, Tisdall and others 2000) . However, there are only sporadic reports of a similar syndrome following intrahepatic shunt ligation; for example, in a cat (White and others 1996) , a dog (White and others 1998) and, possibly, a further two dogs (Komtebedde and others 1991) . In fact, one recent large series identified this syndrome in 11 of 89 dogs following surgery for extrahepatic portosystemic shunts but in none of 32 dogs after surgery for intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (Tisdall and others 2000) .",

At surgery, an anomalous branch of the right division of the hepatic portal vein was identified.

Approximately 42 hours postoperatively, the cat exhibited two generalised motor seizures 30 minutes apart. These were controlled with two 1\u00b74 mg/kg intravenous boluses and one enema of diazepam, and 0\u00b72 ml/kg lactulose enemas were administered every four hours (Table 3) . The cat became ambulatory by 52 hours postoperatively, at which point vertical nystagmus, head pressing, wandering and lack of response to auditory and visual stimuli were apparent.

An extrahepatic portocaval shunt was identified at surgery and was attenuated using a 6\u00b75 mm ameroid constrictor (Research Instruments NW; Corvallis). However, the dog remained polydipsic and there was evidence of continuing portosystemic shunting 11 weeks postoperatively, when postprandial bile acids were elevated.

Seizures stopped after two boluses of 1 mg/kg diazepam IV, but the dog remained unresponsive and was referred to the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies (R[D]SVS). Frank blood was regurgitated after six hours and profuse nasal and rectal bleeding began 90 minutes later. Activated blood clotting time was increased (four minutes; reference range less than 2\u00b75 minutes) and the dog was thrombocytopenic (manual count 45 \u202b01\u05df\u202c 9 /litre). A whole blood transfusion was started. At this point, the dog had elevated serum bile acids (309\u00b77 \u00b5mol/litre; reference range 0 to 15 \u00b5mol/litre) and ammonia (Table 4 ) and was hypoglycaemic (Table 4 ) and hypoalbuminaemic (15 g/litre; reference range 27 to 38 g/litre). The animal became increasingly dyspnoeic and radiography showed an alveolar lung pattern. The dog went into respiratory arrest followed rapidly by cardiac arrest 14 hours after the initial period of status epilepticus. Postmortem examination was not performed, at the owner's request.",

Results of serum biochemical analysis were consistent with hepatic dysfunction, and abdominocentesis recovered a small volume of ascitic fluid. Portosystemic shunting may have recurred through the original shunting vessels or through acquired extrahepatic shunts. Alternatively, hepatic dysfunction may have resulted from undiagnosed hepatic pathology. Frustratingly, this case had been scheduled for reassessment during the preceding week, but had not been presented at that time. Elevated ammonia may have been significant in the aetiology of seizures but equally may have been secondary to intestinal haemorrhage. Similarly, hypoglycaemia cannot be excluded as a cause of seizures, but may have been secondary to the prolonged period of status epilepticus. This dog was presented with a bleeding disorder and seizures may have occurred secondarily to a cerebral bleed. Propofol CRIs have been described for the management of seizures following portosystemic shunt ligation at rates of 0\u00b71 to 0\u00b725 mg/kg/minute (Heldmann and others 1999) . These are said to have advantages over other anticonvulsant therapies, including the ability to titrate to effect the infusion rate to reduce sedative effects, making patient care easier. However, in both cases receiving propofol CRIs in this study (cases 3 and 4), the animals remained unconscious, necessitating intensive nursing care. In fact, both of these cases and case 2, which received a CRI of midazolam, aspirated food, leading to deterioration of their condition and death of cases 2 and 3. Midazolam and propofol suppress swallowing and gag reflexes, while propofol also reduces gastrooesophageal sphincter pressure (Waterman and Hashim 1992) . These features may have contributed to regurgitation and aspiration following nasal tube feeding.",

Falling levels of circulating endogenous benzodiazepine ligands have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological complications. These metabolites are thought to originate in the intestinal tract, being metabolised by the liver before they can enter the systemic circulation. During portosystemic shunting, the metabolites may bypass the liver and enter the systemic circulation, where they could contribute to hepatic encephalopathy by depressing central nervous system function. One hypothesis suggests that the brain becomes dependent on the endogenous ligands and neurological dysfunction occurs after systemic levels fall following shunt ligation (Aronson and others 1997) .

The present case may represent a variation of this, with partial situs inversus associated with abnormal abdominal vasculature, providing an unusual cause of portosystemic shunting.",

This report supports the conclusions of Hardie and others (1990) and Tisdall and others (2000) that close postoperative monitoring of portosystemic shunt cases should extend for at least 72 hours. Different protocols for the medical management of post-ligation seizures have been reported. The ideal protocol and role of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy await further study. The authors advise against nasoesophageal or nasogastric feeding in animals treated with CRI of propofol or midazolam due to the risk of aspiration. Aspiration was a complication in all three dogs in this study and was considered to be the cause of death in two of them. Animals that survive post-ligation seizures may have long-term neurological problems. Extrahepatic and intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may present together, highlighting the need for careful preoperative and intraoperative evaluation.",
