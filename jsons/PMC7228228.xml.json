Inclusion criteria were patient age equal or below 5 years and presence of at least 2 symptoms of ARI including cough, coryza, sneezing, dyspnea, wheezing and/or fever. From 282 patients, 12 presented with 2 symptoms (4%), 37 presented with 3 symptoms (13%), 52 presented with 4 symptoms (18%), 84 presented with 5 symptoms (30%) and 95 patients presented with all 6 symptoms that were recorded (34%); for 2 patients we lacked clinical data. From the 282 included patients, 22 presented underlying disease (8%). More specifically, a total of 21 patients had heterogeneous symptoms of heart disease, 16 of which tested positive for at least one virus and 5 of which tested negative. One patient that tested negative for all respiratory viruses was infected with HIV, none presented cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis. The underlying disease did not lead to exclusion from this study. Samples were collected from the pediatric hospital Darcy Vargas (n = 157) and the Parais\u00f3polis Basic Health Unit (n = 125), in the Parais\u00f3polis area, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The gender\u2010balanced cohort comprised 136 males and 146 females at a median age of 14 months (interquartile range, 7\u201024). Samples per season were: Summer, n = 29 (December 21st\u2010March 19th, frequent rains, relatively higher temperature); autumn, n = 56 (March 20th\u2010June 20th, dry, decreasing temperature); winter, n = 125 (June 21st\u2010September 21st, dry, cold); spring, n = 72 (September 22nd\u2010December 20th, humid, increasing temperatures).

            "text": "The seventh similarity comprised two contrasting HRV epidemiological patterns, namely replacement of some HRV strains and maintenance of other HRV strains over time. HRV comprises three defined species termed HRV A\u2010C, and >100 different types likely representing multiple distinct serotypes.25 We successfully typed a total of 77 HRV strains representing all three HRV species (GenBank accession numbers MH824434\u2010MH824510), whereas 16 HRV strains could not be typed. Proportions of individual HRV species in our study (53.2% HRV\u2010A, 6.5% HRV\u2010B, 40.3% HRV\u2010C) were in agreement with other reports worldwide.17, 26 The majority of distinct HRV strains in our study were detected only in one season, a common HRV epidemiological pattern.17, 25, 26, 27 In contrast, seven clusters termed I\u2010VII, each composed of three to five patient\u2010derived HRV strains presenting a very low mutual pairwise sequence distance (\u22642%), were detected over more than two seasons. The seven clusters belonged to HRV species A and C and differed from one another by 15% to 39% mutual nucleotide sequence distance. Previous studies on HRV typing using the genomic fragment used in our study found that defined HRV serotypes differed by at least 10% mutual nucleotide sequence distance.17 Following this criterion, strains belonging to one cluster in our study thus likely represent the same HRV serotype, whereas the seven clusters all represent distinct HRV serotypes. Community protective immunity can dramatically limit the circulation of defined viral serotypes, including HRV and other viruses.17, 28 This was apparently the case for some, but not all HRV serotypes in our study, the latter potentially facilitated by the population structure of the slum. Prolonged circulation of HRV clusters was detected specifically during winter and spring (Figure 1G, clusters I, III, V, VII), summer and spring (cluster II), winter and summer (cluster IV), and autumn and summer (cluster VI). These data were reminiscent of prolonged circulation of closely related HRV lineages for 4 to 12 months or over three consecutive seasons reported previously from Sweden and Finland26, 27 and are thus not unique to our study setting. Notably, we cannot exclude that HRV strains may have been re\u2010introduced repeatedly from other areas of S\u00e3o Paulo, a large metropolis accumulating about 21 million inhabitants, potentially facilitated by commuting of slum inhabitants to nearby areas for labor.15\n",

The first may be explained by widely documented local variation in annual hMPV circulation,29 exacerbated here by limited sampling during the expected hMPV season, usually late winter/early spring as reported previously in S\u00e3o Paulo.30 The absence of FLU seasonality, usually related to rainy seasons in tropical and subtropical regions,31 may have been facilitated by the population characteristics of the Brazilian slum allowing continued FLU transmission and maintenance over relatively dryer seasons. However, a similar lack of seasonality was not observed for hRSV and HCoV, suggesting that definite assertions on the reasons underlying the absence of FLU seasonality cannot be made at this point.",
