Although both TCEP and DTT are classified as strong reducing agents, TCEP decreased the enzyme efficiency (K\ncat/K\nM) of the NS3/4A by half, whereas DTT increased it by 1.6-fold. The K\nM of 3CLpro was very similar with all four reducing agents, and the V\nmax was slightly increased by all four reducing agents. In contrast, the K\nM of PLpro was affected to different degrees depending on which reducing agent was used. The K\nM of PLpro increased by 4-, 1.5-, and 2.5-fold in the presence of DTT, GSH, and TCEP, respectively, when compared with the K\nM without any reducing agent (Table 1).

All initial screening assays were done in duplicate in 384-well plates, and replicate plots and Z factors are shown (Fig. 1\n). The Z factor was calculated from the mean and standard deviation of 32 positive and 32 negative controls in each plate.

The goal of our compound screening is to identify inhibitors for viral enzymes that will be developed into antivirals. Thus, identifying inhibitors that are active in human cells where GSH is present at high concentration is most logical. In addition, it may be good to test the inhibitory activity of hit compounds against GSSG, which is predominant in serum, because compounds will likely pass through human serum before reaching the intracellular environment. Based on this definition of true positives, we found that TCEP produced the largest number of false positives in the case of NS3/4A. The most false positives were identified in the absence of reducing agent against the two cysteine proteases 3CLpro and PLpro, indicating the necessity of using reducing agents for these two enzymes (Table 2; see also Tables S1\u2013S3 in Supplementary material). DTT showed the largest number of false negatives (compounds identified as positives with GSH) for NS3/4A, and TCEP showed the smallest number, although both are strong reducing agents. These two strong reducing agents showed more false negatives against 3CLpro. On the other hand, DTT showed 9 compounds to be false negatives for PLpro, whereas TCEP, the other strong reducing agent, showed only 2 false negatives. We also analyzed the same data with a 50% inhibition cutoff as compared with a 35% cutoff for positive hits. Overall, the results came out similar, although the numbers of hits are obviously smaller with a 50% cutoff. DTT still showed the most false negatives with all three proteases, and TCEP showed the least with NS3/4A and PLpro. The number of false negatives with TCEP and \u03b2-MCE was significantly reduced for both NS3/4A and PLpro with a 50% cutoff. In the case of 3CLpro, all three reducing agents had both false positives and false negatives, and the numbers are only slightly less than those for a 35% cutoff.",

In the case of NS3/4A, the IC50 values of 14 compounds were significantly affected, showing a loss of inhibitory activity for 9 compounds in the presence of DTT and/or \u03b2-MCE (inhibitors 1\u20136 in Fig. 2A and inhibitors 36\u201338 in Table S4 of Supplementary material). For example, the IC50 of inhibitor 3 against NS3/4A was 48.4 \u03bcM when no reducing agent was present. This IC50 did not change by much in the presence of GSH (IC50\n = 69.4 \u03bcM), but it decreased by 5-fold in the presence of TCEP (IC50\n = 12.8 \u03bcM). The same compound showed no inhibition (IC50\n > 200 \u03bcM) in the presence of either DTT or \u03b2-MCE. Among the 3CLpro positives, there were 6 inhibitors (inhibitors 13\u201318 in Fig. 2B) that exhibited loss of inhibitory activity in the presence of either DTT or TCEP or even without any reducing agent, and 6 PLpro inhibitors (inhibitors 25\u201330 in Fig. 2C) were also not detected in the presence of either DTT or \u03b2-MCE.",

We compared the average Hill slope values of compounds that display dramatic shifts in IC50 values in the presence of DTT to determine whether DTT prevents inhibition in the assay by eliminating an aggregation-based inhibition. For NS3/4A, the average Hill slope values of all 9 compounds (compounds 1\u20136 and 36\u201338) were near 1 for all three reducing agents except for 1 compound (compound 6). The Hill slope of compound 6 was near 1 in the presence of GSH, but it was near 2 in the presence of both TCEP and \u03b2-MCE. Similarly, among 6 3CLpro hit compounds that lost their inhibitory activity in the presence of DTT (or TCEP), the Hill slope values of all those compounds were near 1 with at least one other reducing agent. In the case of PLpro hits, the Hill slopes of 3 compounds (compounds 25\u201327) increased with GSH and TCEP, but those of the other 3 compounds (compounds 28\u201330) were still near 1 with both GSH and \u03b2-MCE. Although a few compounds (3 of 20 negatives with DTT) may have produced aggregation-based inhibition, the majority of hit compounds that showed dramatic shifts in IC50 values did not produce the aggregation-based inhibition. According to this analysis, DTT does not generally appear to prevent aggregation-based nonspecific inhibition for the majority of the negatives.",

IC50 value comparisons revealed that reducing agents significantly affect inhibitory activities of screened compounds, and this leads to an important question: which IC50 values should we consider to be a true indicator of potency for inhibitors? We suggest that IC50 values with GSH should be considered to be the best indicator of in vivo efficacy, at least for intracellular enzyme targets, because GSH is the physiological reducing agent in the human body. However, GSH has not been used as a reducing agent in HTS assays due to concerns of potential oxidation under assay conditions. GSH is known to undergo oxidation in aqueous buffer conditions, forming the disulfide bonded GSSG. We carried out a detailed study on the stability of GSH by monitoring both GSH and GSSG amounts and found that only 10% of GSH was oxidized to GSSG over a 6-h time period at room temperature. The presence of NS3/4A in the assay buffer did not affect the stability of GSH (Fig. 3\nA), whereas GSH was slightly stabilized by the two cysteine proteases, 3CLpro and PLpro, as compared with GSH alone (Fig. 3B and 3C). Thus, it is feasible to use GSH as a reducing agent in an HTS assay for up to a 6-h time period provided that fresh GSH is added to the assay buffer every 6 h.",

Although the former can be eliminated in secondary or tertiary assays with some time and effort, false negatives from the initial HTS assays can derail the efforts of drug discovery through the loss of potentially novel inhibitors. Our results suggest that each reducing agent could have different effects on substrate affinity and enzyme activity in the case of both cysteine and serine proteases. The enzyme efficiency of NS3/4A and PLpro was affected by the type of reducing agent, whereas 3CLpro efficiency was not affected. Both 3CLpro and PLpro contain cysteine residues in their active sites, but the reducing agents had very different effects on their kinetic parameters. The types of reducing agents affected the three proteases in different ways. This observation was not in keeping with the presumed role of the reducing agents as antioxidants. It has been suggested that reducing agents may have some additional functions other than working as simple antioxidants [12], [26], [27], [28]. A recent study showed that DTT weakened the monomer interaction of HIV-1 integrase (IN) when it forms a dimer [28]. For each target enzyme, additional roles of reducing agent remain to be discovered.",

Although it remains to be determined exactly how reducing agents affect apparent activity, it is important to note that the outcome of any HTS assay can be seriously affected by the choice of reducing agent. In addition, as they pursue lead compounds, researchers rely on the IC50 value of an inhibitor as an indicator of compound potency. It also would be problematic if different reducing agents could alter the potency of screened compounds. We discovered that the potency of the same inhibitor was altered from approximately 10 \u03bcM with one reducing agent to the complete loss of inhibitory activity (IC50\n > 200 \u03bcM) with another. This is a very significant difference, and hence the choice of a proper reducing agent is critical because this may lead to the pursuit of poor lead compounds (false positives) or to missing good potential lead candidates (false negatives).",
