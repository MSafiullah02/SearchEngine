Voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP)-based low-bit rate voice services have developed rapidly with the widespread and popularization of Internet technologies. Therefore, studies on steganographic techniques based on low-bit rate VoIP are highly significant in theory and in practice [2]. VoIP-based steganography had been developed most rapidly among multitudes of steganographic methods that use streaming media as carriers. This is because the secret information embedded within VoIP communications is highly dynamic, which renders these steganographic methods robust against tampering of attackers. Furthermore, VoIP speech codec can provide excellent levels of imperceptibility and hiding capacity [4, 5].",

Reference [6] proposed a novel QIM (quantization index modulation) steganography based on the replacement of quantization index set in linear predictive coding (LPC), by treating each quantization index set as a point in quantization index space. Their algorithm had significantly improved the embedding efficiency. Tian [7] tried to present a novel steganalysis method based on statistic characteristics of fundamental frequency, so as to prevent the illegitimate use of voice-over-IP-based information hiding. They introduced the statistics for zero-crossing count (ZCC) and the average values of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to characterize inactive frames, and then, they propose a support vector machine-based steganalysis for inactive speech frames. Experiment results showed that their method significantly outperforms the previous ones. Wang [8] put forward a new steganography algorithm by embedding data while pitch period prediction is conducted during low-bit rate speech encoding. Their approach has great compatibility and can achieve high quality of speech and prevent detection of steganalysis without causing further delay by data embedding and extraction. Article [9] proposed a method of text emotional modulation steganography based on machine learning. By intelligently expanding the text emotional lexicon and using cosine similarity algorithm to conduct the steganography algorithm, their method obtained sound efficiency, security, concealment, and robustness. By revealing the inactive frames of VoIP streams which are more suitable for data embedding than the active frames of the streams, paper [10] presented a novel high capacity steganography algorithm for embedding data in the inactive frames of low-bit rate audio streams. Their algorithm had achieved perfect imperceptibility and high data embedding rate up to 101 bits/frame, in which the data embedding capacity is very much larger than most of the existing algorithms. Yang [11] proposed a highly imperceptible, high capacity steganographic algorithm based on the noise coding frames of the G.723.1 codec. Literature [12] studied a novel method to embed sensitive data into G.723.1 speech codec by using the characteristic of the codec. Their algorithm can obtain good efficiency and performance. Guo [13] put forward an imperceptible information hiding approach on 5.3 Kbit/s codec of G.723.1. To increase the data embedding capacity, they also propose a voice activity detection method that uses the residual signal energy of the speech signal.\n",

El-Khamy et al. [15] give out a new robust audio steganography technique based on optimum two-dimensional complete complementary codes (CCC). When adopted their method to embed colour images data, and with various attacks applied to the carrier audio signals, simulation experimental results showed that the extracted image had good quality, which proves high robustness and capacity of their proposed algorithm. Literature [16] counts the unimportant bits of the compressed low-bit speech stream, proposes embedding hidden information in the speech stream, and designs a voice concealed communication system of IP network using this algorithm to improve the security of secret information transmission. Literature [17] proposes an algorithm based on code word characteristics, which enables G.729A to carry out QIM steganography to detect effectively in a short time. Paper [18] discussed the application of speech-based information hiding in the area of medical scenario.

However, the robustness, concealment, and hiding capacity of existing algorithms are still difficult to meet the needs of practical applications. Therefore, it is urgent to study new information hiding methods that have both high privacy and high hiding capacity. To explore a more effective way to establish a novel convert communication channel over compressed speech stream, this paper presents a steganography method based on modulation of the excitation pulse positions of the G.723.1 low-bit rate codec and G.729A speech codec as the research scenario. In the proposed method, the secret sensitive information is hidden in the above speech stream by finely modulating the codes of excitation pulse positions. Experimental results show that the proposed steganography algorithm of G.723.1 speech codec with an embedding rate of 3.1% and secret information transfer rate of 166 bits/s results in < 5.7% degradations in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) scores, which indicates a high degree of imperceptibility. As to the proposed steganography algorithm of G.729A speech codec, our method can achieve 400 bite/s secret information communication with 3% embedding rate, while the capacity and the degradation rate of the PESQ score for the carrier speech is less than 7%, indicating that the hidden method studied has good privacy and efficacy.",

Firstly, speech analysis and processing are performed, followed by the calculation of LPC indices, adaptive codebook lags, the combinatorial codes of all gains, pulse signs, and pulse positions. The pulse positions are then finely modulated according to the secret information; finally, the data are packaged for transmission via ordinary communication channels. The extraction of secret information is illustrated in Fig. 2b. After the data packets have been received from a communication channel, they are unpacked to extract all of the relevant parameters. The secret information hidden in the excitation pulse positions is then extracted according to its embedding rules, before the data are passed on to the decoder for speech reconstruction.",

These experiments are also implemented using the scheme described in Sect. 5.1. To investigate different combinations of these algorithms, we perform experiments based on the four scenarios that are described below: (1) 3 bits of information is hidden in the first pulse of each subframe, except 1 bit of information that is hidden in the reserved bit; hence, each frame (which contains 4 subframes) can hide 13 bits of information in total. (2) 3 bits of information is hidden in the first pulse of each subframe, and 1 bit of information is hidden in the last bit of the last subframe, while 1 more bit of information is hidden in the reserved bit; hence, each frame hides 17 bits of information in total. (3) In each subframe, 3 bits of information is hidden in the first pulse and 1 bit of information is hidden in each of the last two pulses, and 1 bit of information is hidden in the reserved bit. Hence, each frame is hiding 21 bits of information in total. (4) In each subframe, 3 bits of information is hidden in the first pulse while the 1 bit of information is hidden in the last bit in each of the remaining pulses, and 1 more bit of information is hidden in the reserved bit. Since the first and third subframes have 6 pulse positions while the second and fourth subframes have 5 pulse positions; each frame is therefore hiding 31 bits of information in total. For the PESQ reduction and its reduction percentage of the above fourth scenario is too sharp, the fourth scenario is not suitable or practicable for information hiding.",

In Tables 7 and 8, it is shown that a combination of Algorithms 4_2 and 4_3 greatly increases the hiding capacity while the PESQ reduction percentages are acceptable. The PESQ scores of the speech carrier decreased with increasing hiding capacity and embedding rate. Nonetheless, when the hiding capacity reaches 700 bits/s and embedding rate goes up to 10.9%, the reduction percentage of the PESQ score was still < 16.7%, which shows that the proposed scheme is rational, sound, and effective.",

Obviously, covert communication based on information hiding can be widely used for the secret transmission of confidential information of institutions, organizations, enterprises, and individuals. Especially in the recent application scenario of the key data sharing of the novel coronavirus (i.e. COVID-19) outbreak information, covert communication based on information hiding can not only realize the safe sharing of related information, but also effectively protect the privacy of related personnel and even personal safety. Next, we discuss the design of a stealthy communication experiment system for the safe and secret sharing of key sensitive data. The structure diagram of the hidden communication experimental application system based on information hiding is shown in Fig. 6.",

These devices need to have the conditions or capabilities to deploy sending/receiving agents. The sending and receiving agents implement the processing procedures of the information hiding algorithm proposed in this paper. They are responsible for embedding the confidential information that needs to be sent or shared into the voice carrier, or extracting the confidential information embedded in the voice carrier. The virtual hidden channel is realized by transmitting the encrypted voice data on the public shared channel.",

We present four steganography algorithms based on different strategies. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed steganographic method can obtain high levels of imperceptibility, security, and robustness with sound hiding capacities. As for G.723.1 speech codec, we can achieve a data hiding capacity of 3.1%, 5.6%, or 10.6% (secret information transmission rate of 166 bits/s, 300 bits/s or 566 bits/s) results in 5.7%, 9.4%, or 12.5% reductions in PESQ scores, respectively, while for G.729A, we can also obtain a data hiding capacity of 2.5%, 3.75%, or 5% (secret information transmission rate is 200 bits/s, 300 bits/s or 400 bits/s) results in < 5.4%, < 8.1%, or < 16.8% reductions in PESQ scores. The above experimental results show our algorithms can obtain high degree of imperceptibility, security, and robustness. The comparative experiment also demonstrated that our algorithm has a higher level of overall efficacy than similar algorithms in the related literature. The information hiding algorithms studied in this paper can be widely used in various application scenarios for the confidential transmission of confidential information, such as protecting the important sensitive information of various institutions or the privacy of personal financial and health information. Although the algorithms proposed in this paper have good comprehensive performance and efficiency, the capacity of information hiding still does not meet the needs of high-speed covert communication, and the contradiction of increasing hidden capacity and increasing privacy has not yet been fully resolved. In the future, we will focus on applications of the methods developed in this work. In addition, we will further investigate the possibility of performing steganography based on other speech codec parameters so as to discover even more effective steganography approach in the area.",
