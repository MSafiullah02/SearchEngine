The expression of HSP47 has been reported to increase in parallel with the expression of collagens during the progression of various fi brosis models. We attempted to attenuate pulmonary collagen accumulation by inhibiting the overexpression of HSP47 with antisense oligonucleotides in an experimental pulmonary fi brosis model induced with bleomycin.

The most common risk factor for ARDS was reported to be severe sepsis with a suspected pulmonary source, followed by severe sepsis with a suspected nonpulmonary source. Infl ammation itself can migrate to various or-gans as do spreading cancer cells. Therefore, improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS and devising new strategies for treating ARDS in the exacerbatory phase are important, because almost all ARDS patients are admitted to intensive care units during this period. In this period, infl ammation can be exacerbated not only by infective organisms but also by endogenous proteins released from injured tissues. We call this the pernicious infl ammatory cycle of infl ammatory autoinjury (see Fig. 1 ).",
