But, up to date epidemic/endemic transmission of ZIKV has been limited to tropical and subtropical regions, which suggests that ZIKV transmitted though alternatives routes to mosquito bites is not capable of maintaining on going transmission on their own in the absence of tropical/subtropical Aedes spp. vectors and/or a climate hot enough for ZIKV transmission by these species [1, 2] . To manage risks for endemic ZIKV infection in ZIKV-free countries some aspects should be considered.",

Pilgrimage, sports events, outdoor shows, musical festivals, political or cultural events and other celebrations that congregate crowds in a confined area increases the risk of a range of infectious diseases [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Travellers to these crowded events cannot only introduce an infectious disease to a previously na\u00efve area, but can also magnify transmission at the people meeting and further propagate transmission after their return home. This statement has been fulfilled on multiple occasions, as was the case of the transmission of 2009 H1N1 pandemic afterward a large Easter holiday gathering in Iztapalapa, Mexico [6, 8] . Similarly, crowded congregation of population has been associated to the spreading of the Great Pandemic in 1918 and the Asian Flu Pandemic in 1957, creating a global disease outbreak [9, 10] .",

As an example, during the 2014 FIFA Football World Cup in Brazil, mathematical models estimated 33 cases of DENV (range 3-59 cases) among foreign tourists, of nearly 600,000 of expected visitors [18, 19] . So far, only 3 cases of DENV were reported associated to this sport event [16, 20] . It's postulated that the low numbers of cases finally diagnosed of DENV were the result of a year with an unusually low incidence in Brazil, probably due to a severe drought in 2014, reducing the number of expected cases in visitors. Also, the typical lower temperatures of the months in which the event was held (June and July), contributed to this small amount of cases [21, 22] .",

Previously, Aedes mosquito was implicated in local transmission of CHiKV and DENV in Mediterranean countries [4, 39, 40] . The species have also been responsible for outbreaks of yellow fever in Italy in 1804 [4, 41] . The existence of previous autochthonous arboviriasis transmitted by the same vector, make the infection by ZIKV also feasible in Western Europe at least seasonally, when competent vector species are present. The arrival of summer in North Hemisphere is linked to a peak in mosquito Aedes population and a most efficient viral replication, so from June to September climatic influence could also favour the establishment of ZIKV disease in Europe [42] .",

In 2014, after an outbreak of CHiKV in Montpellier, a successful integrated prevention and response programme was performed. Although the absence of immediate mosquito control treatment near the primary case's residence (because the vector was initially not identified) and a lack of awareness of this disease among health professionals facilitated the spread of the infection up to 12 cases. However, there was a quick response following the alert. Subsequently after the detection of the cases, French authorities focused on epidemiological and Entomological investigations and stressed vector control treatments, which played a part in prompt containing the outbreak [49] .",

This requires capability to detect and diagnose cases early, perform systematic and regular surveillance, and adapt resources to sustain enhanced mosquito control. Clinicians should be aware to enable early detection of ZIKV cases and there must be sufficient and validated laboratory capacity for virus detection, virus identification and serological testing. International and local guidelines can help clinicians on how to handle suspicious cases, how to confirm the infection and how to report suspected and confirmed cases. In case of autochthonous ZIKV detection, public authorities should perform surveillance and provide adequate resources to sustain enhanced mosquito control. Also, information should be promptly circulated to all health professionals, public health services and other sectors. Failure to do so could lead to the possibility of spreading more extensively, resulting in greater costs for vector control and health care for infected people [50] .",
