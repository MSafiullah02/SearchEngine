Apoptosis is able to remove cells without a trace, and is an important physiological mechanism to maintain homeostasis in mammals. Because of its physiological significance, the execution of apoptosis must be strictly regulated, and a large number of molecules are involved in controlling apoptosis.",

For instance, apoptosis plays a pivotal role in IAV elimination through the removal of the virus infected cells, and tissue damage during the course of IAV infection including multiple organ dysfunction is caused by apoptosis [1], [2]. Further, abnormal induction of lymphocyte apoptosis is related in the disease symptoms of influenza, and apoptosis is also important to terminate inflammation through the induction of activation-induced cell death (AICD). In this review, focusing on the relationship between IAV proteins and apoptosis related host cellular molecules, strategies of IAV for effective viral propagation by the regulation of apoptosis are discussed.",

After disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the cytochrome c in the mitochondrial inner membrane is released into the cytoplasm, and caspase-9 is activated by Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1) which is known to be a cytoplasmic sensor molecule for cytochrome c [9]. The mitochondria membrane potential is mainly regulated by Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family proteins [10], a family of proteins characterized by BH (Bcl-2 homology) domains, and Bcl-2 are classified into three types. One is a pro-apoptotic multi-domain sub-family of proteins including Bax (Bcl-2-associated x protein) and Bak (Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer). These proteins have BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains, and activate apoptosis induction through the increment of permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Another is the anti-apoptotic sub-family proteins which have BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 domains, and include Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large). These proteins exhibit anti-apoptotic functioning through the inhibition of the pro-apoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 sub-family function. The third is pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins, such as Bid (BH3 interacting-domain death agonist) and Bad (Bcl-2-associated death promoter). These proteins are antagonists to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 subfamily protein function, and promote apoptosis.",

Importantly, apoptosis through these two major pathways is crucial for the elimination of IAV through the removal of the virus infected cells from the body, as well as it is involved in the effective replication of the IAV. Previous study has demonstrated that activation of caspase-3 is important for the effective replication of the IAV through the activation of exportation of the viral RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [11]. This may indicate that the IAV utilizes apoptosis signaling molecules, crucial for host immune response to eliminate the virus, conversely for the effective replication of the IAV.",

Abnormally elevated expression of these death ligands is frequently found in lethal IAV infections, and aberrant induction of apoptosis caused by these death ligands is thought to be related in the onset of the multi organ disorders occurring in severe IAV infections.

Overall, death receptor-mediated signaling pathway contributes to apoptosis induced by IAV infection through the activation of caspases mediated by FADD and JNK, and death receptor-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB is crucial for enhancement of death receptor-mediated signaling in both autocrine and paracrine manner.",

Previously, the importance of NF-\u03baB-dependent expressions of TRAIL, Fas, and FasL has been reported [15].

It has also been reported that treatment with JNK inhibitor exhibits antiviral activity against IAV infections [18]. Generally, the JNK signaling pathway is related to stress induced apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial pathway. However, JNK activation is also implicated in cell proliferation and survival under some conditions. It is assumed that transient activation of JNK is involved in increasing cell viability, and that sustained activation of JNK is associated with apoptosis induction. The dual phased function of JNK might explain these controversial phenomena. In addition, since JNK activation emphasizes death receptor mediated apoptosis induction, the inhibition of JNK activation could be effective to protect from the apoptosis caused by abnormally elevated expressions of inflammatory cytokines including death ligands after IAV infection [19].",

Because of the physiological significance of IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway, this pathway is inhibited by many viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, Ebora virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [22], [23]. Inhibition of the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway is also assumed to be important for the effective replication of IAV. The IAV has several viral components to inhibit the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway (Fig. 3\n). The NS1 protein of the IAV binds to RIG-I and inhibits RIG-I functioning through its RNA binding activity [24]. In addition, the function of TRIM25 (tripartite motif-containing protein 25), the E3 ubiquitin ligase crucial for the RIG-I mediated IFN production, is also inhibited by the NS1 protein [25]. The viral polymerase complex binds to IPS-1 and inhibits the IPS-1 function for type I IFN production [26]. Further, PB1-F2, a viral protein encoded in the second open reading frame of IAV segment 2 mRNA, is also involved in the inhibition of the IPS-1-mediated production of type I IFN by binding to IPS-1 [27]. Results of the comprehensive proteomic analysis indicate that the viral polymerase complex may bind to ZAPS (zinc finger antiviral protein, short form) [28], the positive regulator of the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway by binding to RIG-I [29]. This finding suggests that the viral polymerase complex may modulate its function.",

Since the function of Siva-1 in the virus replication completely disappears after treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD fmk, the Siva-1 appears to modulate IAV replication through the controlling activation of caspases (Fig. 4\n). Several apoptosis-related molecules involved in Siva-1 mediated apoptosis induction were reported, and one of these is XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) [32]. The XIAP is known to be an anti-apoptotic protein, and it directly inhibits proteolytic activity of caspases including caspase-3 by binding [33]. Siva-1 is considered to be involved in the inhibition of XIAP function, and a previous report demonstrated that overexpression of XIAP inhibits IAV replication [11].

            "text": "Some molecules involved in the death receptor mediated signaling pathway are also important for the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway. For instance, FADD, an adaptor molecule responsible for activating caspase-8 in the death receptor signaling pathway, is important for NF-\u03baB activation in the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway [34]. The TRADD, an adapter molecule crucial for the recruitment of FADD to TNF\u03b1R1, is also involved in the activation of the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway for type I IFN production [35]. In addition, DAP3 is known to be crucial for apoptosis induced by TRAIL stimulation through the recruitment of FADD to DR4 and DR5, and is also related to other IPS-1 functions. A previous report has demonstrated that IPS-1 is also involved in induction of anoikis [36], which is known to be a form of apoptosis induced by anchorage-dependent cells detaching from the surrounding extracellular matrix. In anoikis induction, DAP3 binds to IPS-1 and recruits FADD for activation of caspase-8, and then apoptosis is executed. The DAP3 function in anoikis induction is inhibited by Akt-dependent phosphorylation [37], and as described in the previous section, AKT is activated by the NS1 protein of IAV. Therefore, the DAP3 function inducing anoikis is thought to be inhibited in IAV infected cells. The role of the DAP3 and IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway for apoptosis induction on IAV infection is not fully understood. However, DAP3 is also crucial for apoptosis induced by TNF-\u03b1, FasL, and TRAIL stimulation [8], [38]. Therefore, DAP3 and DAP3 related molecules, such as LKB1 (liver kinase B1) [39], and DELE (death ligand signal enhancer) [40], are thought to be implicated in the virus replication and regulation of apoptosis caused by the IAV infection.",
