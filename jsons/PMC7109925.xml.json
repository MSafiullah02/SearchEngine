This prospective study was conducted in an urban public teaching hospital (Ben Taub General Hospital), a children's hospital (Texas Children's Hospital), and a community hospital (St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital) in Houston, Texas, from 1991 through 1995 [20]. Patients with an admitting diagnosis suggestive of an acute respiratory condition or congestive heart failure (CHF) were visited in the hospital to confirm eligibility and to seek consent for participation. Acute respiratory disease diagnoses included the following: pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, bronchitis, croup, and exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with active tuberculosis or known HIV disease were excluded. On admission to the hospital, a nasal and/or throat swab and an acute serum specimen were obtained. A convalescent serum was collected \u226510 days after obtaining the acute serum. Patients' inpatient medical records were reviewed. Information collected included sociodemographic data, symptoms, signs, acute respiratory diagnosis and other diagnoses, the location of admission (i.e., general ward or intensive care unit), the duration of hospitalization, the need for ventilatory support, and the chest radiograph interpretation.",

Rhinoviruses were identified initially by the characteristic cytopathic changes induced in cell culture. Rhinoviruses were differentiated from enteroviruses by use of acid lability or reverse transcriptase (RT)\u2014PCR assays [21]. Coronavirus infections were identified serologically by use of paired serum samples, with the convalescent serum being collected at least 10 days after the acute serum collection. Antibody tests for coronavirus 229E were performed by use of a microneutralization assay, and infection was defined by the presence of a \u22654-fold increase in antibody levels [22]. An ELISA was used to measure antibodies to coronavirus OC43, and infection was defined as a \u22654-fold increase in ELISA IgG antibodies or by a \u22652.5 increase that was confirmed on a repeated test [23]. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses were identified by cell culture and serology, as described elsewhere [24].",

Although the proportion of exacerbations of these diseases associated with respiratory virus exacerbations has been lower than that seen for asthma, the burden of these infections is substantially greater in chronically ill patients than in healthy subjects of a similar age [33, 34]. In the current study, many of the patients aged >35 years had underlying lung disease or CHF. In addition, several patients were admitted with pneumonia. It is unclear whether rhinovirus can cause pneumonia itself [35, 36]. It has been recovered from the lower respiratory tract of infected individuals [37, 38], and an increase in the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchial mucosa has been noted after experimental infection of the upper respiratory tract [39]. The possibility that these viruses might be associated with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia, similar to that described for influenza [40, 41], is suggested by the identification of at least 2 pneumonia illnesses in the oldest age group associated with a concomitant S. pneumoniae infection. However, this study was not designed to delineate such a virus-bacteria interaction.",

Paired sera were available for only a subset of the population; thus, there is substantial potential for the introduction of a bias in identifying the relative importance of coronavirus infections in this population. On the other hand, infections with additional respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus or RSV, may have been missed in those persons who did not have serologic studies performed. Another potential shortcoming is that control populations were not included in the study; therefore, the frequency of rhinovirus or coronavirus infections in ambulatory populations, in populations hospitalized with nonrespiratory conditions, or in asymptomatic populations cannot be determined. However, in a study for which virologic studies were performed in the same laboratory during the same period, <2% of cultures were positive for any respiratory virus from an asymptomatic adult and <1% of serologic studies identified a respiratory virus infection during an asymptomatic period [33]. The use of RT-PCR assays for rhinovirus and coronavirus has increased the frequency with which these virus infections were identified, compared with cell culture or serologic methods in previous studies of asthmatic patients [17, 28, 29]. Such assays were not performed in the current study; therefore, the burden of these infections detected in this study is likely to be a minimal estimate of their infection frequency.",

            "text": "The morbidity associated with rhinovirus and coronavirus infections, especially in high-risk populations such as patients with chronic lung disease, suggests that these infections should be a target for prevention or treatment strategies. The development of a conventional vaccine for rhinovirus has been hampered by the existence of >100 different serotypes and by the lack of protection associated with experimental parenteral vaccines [42]. Less is known about the number of coronavirus serotypes, and no experimental human vaccines have been evaluated. IFN-\u03b1 is an antiviral agent that has been effective in both experimental rhinovirus and coronavirus infection [43\u201345], and also has been used effectively as postexposure prophylaxis for natural colds [46, 47]. The utility of IFN-\u03b1 in normal healthy populations has been limited by its local (nasal) toxicity. Only a single study has evaluated its efficacy for the prevention of respiratory virus infections and the resulting complications in patients with chronic lung disease [48]. No beneficial effects of IFN-\u03b1 were seen in this population of patients with asthma and COPD; however, the study had insufficient power to demonstrate an effect caused by the prevention of rhinovirus and coronavirus infections. Newer antirhinovirus drugs, such as tremacamra and pleconaril, have recently been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of experimental rhinovirus infection [49, 50], which suggests that there may be a role for these drugs in high-risk populations. Because of the morbidity associated with rhinovirus and coronavirus infections in high-risk patients, these groups should be targeted in future evaluations of antiviral chemotherapy strategies.",
