            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are the causative agents of common cold and are the most frequent cause of acute respiratory tract infection both in children and in adults (Arden et al., 2006, Johnston et al., 1995, Nicholson et al., 1993). HRV have a tremendous diversity and 160 subtypes have been recognized so far. Historically, HRV were classified into 100 serotypes based on cross-reactivity in neutralization tests (Hamparian et al., 1987). These serotypes were categorized in a variety of ways such as receptor usage into major or minor group (Uncapher et al., 1991), or according to the sensitivity to antiviral agents into group A or B (Andries et al., 1990). Based on the full-length or partial (VP2/VP4 and VP1) coding sequences they were initially classified into A and B genotypes (Ledford et al., 2004, Savolainen et al., 2002). With the use of molecular diagnostic techniques a novel group was discovered in 2006 (Arden et al., 2006) and was designated C species. HRV-C are not emerging viruses (Arden and Mackay, 2010) but had been circulating unnoticed due to the inability to culture them. Sequencing of the complete genomes of A, B and available C types confirmed their assignment into three distinct phylogenetic taxa (Palmenberg et al., 2009).",

There is some evidence that HRV-C may be more virulent than other species (Kaida et al., 2011, Mak et al., 2011). For example, HRV-C may be more likely than HRV-B to cause more severe illnesses in infancy (Lee et al., 2012), and HRV-C may be more likely than other species to cause acute exacerbations of asthma (Bizzintino et al., 2011, Fry et al., 2011). These findings, along with distinct genetic features and use of alternative cell surface receptor(s) (Bochkov et al., 2011), suggest that there may be important differences in the replication cycle of HRV-C viruses compared to other HRV.",

Hence, in this study we developed a system for differentiating sinus epithelium cells in ALI that supported efficient HRV-C replication.

Molecular modeling studies of HRV-C15 have predicted a loss of mass at the 5-fold axis of symmetry, analogous to an area associated with receptor binding in HRV-A and HRV-B (Palmenberg et al., 2009).

In addition, the number of cells per well is uniform, and the cultures consist almost entirely of epithelial cells which provides a more uniform substrate for viral replication. Another group published the growth of HRV-C15 in ALI system that agrees with our findings (Hao et al., in press).

Although the mechanism of temperature sensitivity is not completely understood, there has been a speculation that the lower GC content of HRV compared to other enteroviruses is an adaptation for replication at lower temperatures (McIntyre et al., 2010). Overall, HRV-C genomes have a higher G+C content (43%) than HRV-A and HRV-B (37% and 38%) and are closer to HEV (ranging from 42 to 48%) (Linsuwanon et al., 2011); this has led to speculation that HRV-C might grow well at core body temperature. Our results support this theory, since both HRV-C15 and another clinical isolate (HRV-C41) grew equally well at 34 \u00b0C vs 37 \u00b0C. Additional isolates of HRV-C and other species need to be tested in the future to determine if the ability to grow well at 37 \u00b0C is a general and distinct property of the C species.",

This system, unlike cell lines (e.g. MRC-5, HeLa and WI-38) that are often used for HRV culture, supported the growth of all three species of HRV, and could therefore enable studies of comparative biology. One limitation of our studies is that viral titer is inferred from the quantity of viral RNA and not by the progeny virus particles produced since plaque assays for HRV-C strains await development. Previous studies have demonstrated excellent correlation between HRV measured by plaque assay and by qPCR (Mosser et al., 2005). Addition of retinoic acid and steroids in the ALI medium is essential for development and differentiation of the HSEC epithelium. However, presence of steroids in the culture medium could affect antiviral responses and in turn virus replication. Further studies are needed to decipher the role of such hormones and growth factors on HRV replication in differentiated HSEC.",

Epithelial cells were seeded in 75 cm2 CellBind\u00ae flasks (Costar; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and cultured in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (BEGM, Lonza, Walkersville, MD). At 90% confluence, the cells were dissociated with trypsin and seeded either as monolayer cultures or for differentiation at ALI. The cells obtained at P-0 and P-1 were frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use. For monolayers, cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1\u00d7105\n cells/ml. For differentiated cultures, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5\u00d7105\n cells/cm2 in BEGM (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) onto the apical surface of 1.13 cm2 Transwell polycarbonate inserts (Costar 0.4 \u03bcm pore size, 10 \u03bcm membrane thickness; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) coated with human placental collagen Type VI (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) in a 12-well plate. The cells were fed basally with BEGM and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for first 24 h. Media was removed from the apical surface and the basal medium was changed to BEGM and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) in a 1:1 ratio supplemented with the following additives: insulin, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml; transferrin, 5 \u03bcg/ml; recombinant epithelial growth factor, 0.25 ng/ml; hydrocortisone, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml; epinephrine, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml; triiodothyronine, 3.25 ng/ml; retinoic acid, 0.05 ng/ml; bovine pituitary extract, 1% (v/v); gentamycin, 50 \u03bcg/ml (\u201cALI\u201d medium) (Gray et al., 1996). The medium was replaced daily for the first seven days and every other day thereafter. The cultures were allowed to mature for at least 21 days until ciliary movement was visualized. The cultures exhibited trans-epithelial resistance (TER) values from 800\u20131200  \u03a9/cm2 at 21 days consistent with formation of tight junctions. The cultures on average contained 1\u00d7106\n cells/well at 30 days of age and formed a pseudo-stratified epithelium (Fig. 1). Tissues from a total of 13 donors were tested, and all except one differentiated in the ALI conditions.",
