We can observe the close similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-CoV virus of 2002, that shares the same interaction between the viral protein Spike (commonly referred to as 'S') and the angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) in the host. 2 ACE2 is a protein with an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular, renal and liver function. It is highly expressed in the lungs and in other tissues, such as the liver (discussed later), intestine, and oral mucosa. 3 Further, ACE2 is expressed more in Asian males compared to females and to other ethnic groups, possibly contributing to the susceptibility of Asians for developing respiratory infections by coronavirus species. 4 Interestingly, in SARS-CoV there was a correlation between the susceptibility to infection of airway epithelia with the state of cell differentiation, and with ACE2 expression and location. SARS-CoV replication has been observed in polarized epithelia, exiting mainly in the apical zone. 2 In this context, tobacco use is strongly associated with many lung diseases and cancer development. Although, strictly speaking no relationship has yet been proven to exist between COVID-19 and tobacco use, smoking is well-recognized to upregulate the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor in polarized airway epithelial cells. It may therefore increase the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 by deregulating the ACE2 receptor. 4 Considering that the European Region has the highest prevalence of tobacco use (29%) worldwide, 5 this may provide a possible explanation for the significant burden of COVID-19, as opposed to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection seen in other parts of the world.",

In contrast, expression of the HLA-DRB1*03:01 allele conferred protection against the disease in both Taiwanese and mainland Chinese populations. 8, 9 Surprisingly, a recent in silico analysis of viral peptide-HLA interaction that awaits publication suggests that the HLA-B*46:01 allele could also impact the severity of COVID-19 and that the HLA-B*15:03 allele could confer immunity to the disease. 10 Vaccination policies between countries could be an important factor in susceptibility or protection against COVID-19. For example, it has been reported that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (commonly referred to as BCG) vaccine may confer protection against respiratory infections. Consistently, a recent study reported that countries that do not utilize the BCG vaccination routinely (Italy, the Netherlands, USA) have been most affected by COVID-19. 11 From a hepatologist's perspective, COVID-19 must be of concern, especially since infection with this virus has led to complications in other organs. In the case of the liver, the first study conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia (NCP) found that 43 of the 99 patients developed a degree of liver injury characterized by an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT); 12 one patient developed severe liver injury (ALT 7590 U/L, AST 1445 U/L). In the latter case, acute liver injury secondary to hypoxic hepatitis could not be excluded. In the study, 97 patients (98%) had a decrease in serum albumin and 75 (76%) had increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase a generalized systemic inflammatory response to the virus could explain these findings. Guan et al. 13 carried out the largest study in NCP patients that included 1099 patients from 552 Chinese hospitals. They noted that patients with severe pneumonia were more likely to develop abnormal aminotransferase levels as compared with those with mild and moderate disease. A recent meta-analysis of four studies has also suggested an increased level of ALT is observed in 29% of patients with COVID-19. 14 Yao et al. 15 undertook a multiple regression analysis and suggested that the appearance of liver injury was probably related to the critical illness itself, with elevations of aminotransferases in the first week and hypoalbuminemia from the second week; both appear to be reversible with resolution of infection.",

The Chinese Digestion Association of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association and the Chinese Society of Hepatology of the Chinese Medical Association recently stated that the development of liver injury in COVID-19 patients might be related to any of the following: 1) a direct hit from this virus; 2) systemic inflammation; 3) hepatic ischemia and hypoxia; 4) pre-existing liver disease; and 5) drug-related liver injury (especially the use of antibiotics or other hepatotoxic drugs in critically ill patients). 16 As mentioned previously, ACE2 is expressed in other tissues, such as the liver. 3 Interestingly, hepatocytes do not express the ACE2 receptor as much as bile duct epithelial cells, suggesting that, at least in theory, biliary tract could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2-driven injury. However, in the studies conducted so far, no increase in bile duct injury markers, such as gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase, has been observed. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 viremia seems to be uncommon, despite severe pneumonia with high viral replication in the lung. The virus has been detected in feces, even several days after clearance on nasopharyngeal swaps. Patients with more advanced liver diseases, including hepatitis B, and those with lower serum albumin levels showed impaired prognosis. A viral translocation from the gut to the liver could allow the virus to reach the liver and promote hepatic injury.",

Similarly, liver biopsies from SARS-CoV patients showed a significant increase in mitotic cell numbers, with eosinophilic bodies and balloon-like hepatocytes, 18 supporting a role for SARS-CoV-2 in the development of liver injury.",
