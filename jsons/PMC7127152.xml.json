            "text": "The equilibrium mixture of compounds 1 and 2 was a white powder. The (+)-FABMS spectrum of this mixture showed isotopic peaks of [M+2H]+ and [M+3H]+ at m/z 554/552 and 555/553, respectively, with an isotopic peak ratio of 1:1. This pseudomolecular ionic configuration is shared with various other nucleosides and amines.11 (+)-HRFABMS analysis of the mix of compounds 1 and 2 yielded the molecular formula C20H19\n79BrN6O6S, with 14 degrees of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of this equilibrium mixture revealed isomeric pairs of signals corresponding to two different molecular structures. Each set of signals can be delineated based on COSY, HMQC, and HMBC data. 1H and 13C NMR spectra indicated the presence of a nucleoside moiety. More specifically, characteristic chemical shifts of C-2 (\u03b4\nC 145.8), C-4 (\u03b4\nC 149.4), C-5 (\u03b4\nC 125.5), C-6 (\u03b4\nC 157.7), and C-8 (\u03b4\nC 140.2) for one set of 13C NMR signals (compound 1) suggested that the purine base was adenine, and this was further confirmed by HMBC correlations between H-2 and C-4 and C-6, and between H-8 and C-4 and C-5 (Fig. 1\n). Successive COSY correlations between H-1\u2032and H-5\u2032confirmed that the four oxygenated methines and the oxygenated methylene of compound 1 were linked to form a furanose moiety. The relative stereochemistry of the pentofuranose was deduced from 1H\u20131\nH NOESY correlations and 1H\u20131\nH coupling constants.12, 13, 14, 15 Furthermore, a NOESY crosspeak between H-1\u2032 and H-4\u2032 indicated that both protons were on the same face of the ring. The sugar moiety was deduced to be \u03b2-d-ribose, as proven by the coupling constants (H-1\u2032, H-2\u2032, and H-3\u2032) and the comparable specific rotation value of the compound 1/2 mixture ([\u03b1]D21-58), which matches those reported for modified ribose units.15 The unusual 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of CH3-7 and CH2-5 were indicative of a sulfoxide group in compound 1, and the HMBC correlation between the methyl protons (H-7) and C-5\u2032 indicated a methylsulfinylfuranose moiety.15, 16 The chemical shifts for the anomeric proton and carbon signals (\u03b4\nH 6.16; \u03b4\nC 90.2) were consistent with the presence of a C\u2013N glycosidic linkage. HMBC correlations between H-1 and C-4 and C-8 confirmed connection between the furanose unit and the adenine moiety at the expected N-9 position. Further 1H NMR analyses and correlations observed in the HMBC spectrum of the mixture indicated the presence of the 6-bromo-5-hydroxy-3-carboxylindolyl moiety, which was previously recognized as a part of the structure of herdmanine E from the same tunicate.4 The correlation between H-3\u2032 and C-8\u2033 suggested that these two moieties were joined by an ester linkage (Fig. 1). Based on the above, compound 1 was characterized as (2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-4-hydroxy-2-[(methylsulfinyl)methyl]tetrahydrofuran-3-yl-(6-bromo-5-hydroxy-1H-indole)-3-carboxylate and given the trivial name momusine A.",

The 1H and 13C NMR signals of each set of components were delineated based on COSY, HMQC, and HMBC. One set (compound 3) of 1H NMR signals was almost identical to those of compound 1, with the exception of a slight chemical shift difference at H-5\u2032 (Table 1\n). In addition, the carbon signals of C-5\u2032 (\u03b4\nC 55.0) and C-7\u2032 (\u03b4\nC 37.3) of compound 3 were shifted slightly upfield versus compound 1 (C-5\u2032, \u03b4\nC 57.5; C-7\u2032, \u03b4\nC 38.0) (Table 2\n). According to the above evidence, compounds 1 and 3 were deduced to be epimers as has been previously described for 5-deoxy-5-methylsulphinyladenosine16 and the sulfoxide derivatives,22 which only differ in their configuration with respect to the position of the sulfoxide group.",

Consequently, compounds 1, 3 and 2, 4 were deduced to be two pairs of epimers (Fig. 2\nA), and this was confirmed by oxidizing the sulfinyl group in mixtures with H2O2 and subsequent HPLC analysis.23 The mixtures of 1/2 (Fig. 2B) and of 3/4 (Fig. 2C) were converted to sulfonyladenosine derivatives, and each mixture yielded identical two-component (5 and 6) mixtures (Fig. 2D and E, respectively). This finding indicated that compounds 1, 3 and 2, 4 are epimeric at the sulfoxide group. 5\u2032-Deoxy-5\u2032-methylsulfinyladenosine epimers have been isolated from Ganoderma lucidum,16 and reported in onion extracts.24, 25 Distinct biological activities have also been described for epimers differentiated by sulfoxide-asymmetry.24, 25 Usually the sulfoxide configuration of natural products is (S).26 In the present study, we tried to determine the absolute stereochemistry of the sulfoxide moiety in compounds 1\u20134 by using MsrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase A, Protein Data Bank code: 1NWA), which selectively reduces S-configured sulfoxides.27 However, neither mixture 1/2 nor mixture 3/4 was reduced by MrsA,28 suggesting that these new nucleosides are not good substrates for MsrA and cannot bind properly to the active enzyme site.",
