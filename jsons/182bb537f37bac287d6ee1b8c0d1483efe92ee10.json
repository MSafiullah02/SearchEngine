Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health. For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below. We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform, motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have. In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform: (a) changing how the person is perceived, (b) enhancing the social behavior of the person, (c) modifying the social behavior of others, (d) providing structure for interactions, and (e) changing how the person feels. We thematically organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.",

This is especially true for individuals dealing with health conditions that require long-term assistance. Whether the impairment that restricts social life is physical as in the case of people with neuromotor disabilities, cognitive as in the case of dementia, emotional as seen in depression, or due to a neurodevelopmental disorder as in the case of autism, the effects of an impoverished social life on health range from reduced quality of life to reduced life-span [4] .",

Tickle-Degnen et al. [5] define the social self-management of health as \"the selfcare practices that ensure social comfort while supporting mental and physical well-being, such as by participating in valued social activities, maintaining rewarding interpersonal relationships, and seeking help from capable people\" (p.1). Socially assistive robots (SARs) are machines that are meant to assist users through social rather than physical interactions [6] . Developed at the intersection of assistive robotics and social robotics, the focus of SARs is to provide necessary aid for humans and to do so by engaging humans socially [7] . In healthcare, SARs are envisioned to play roles such as taking medical interviews [8] , monitoring and keeping a record of symptoms [9] , helping with pill sorting and medication schedules [10] , guiding people through therapeutic tasks [11] , providing companionship [12] , acting as stress reducers and mood enhancers [13] , and supporting social interactions between humans [14, 15] .",

They observed a group of workers with disabilities in the workplace as they performed their tasks, and then interviewed some of them about their work experience.

In addition to functions such as regulating food intake, prompting and delivering medication, coaching the person with dementia through physical therapy exercises and motivating the person to be active, caregivers expressed desire for the robot to also support interactions between them and the person they were caring for. Caregivers wanted robots that could facilitate positive interactions with the person they were providing care for, such as playing favorite songs and inviting both of them to share a dance. They also wanted the robot to lessen the emotional stress of the interaction when the person requiring care was agitated and asked repetitive questions. In this situation, caregivers wanted the robot to answer in their place, distract the agitated person, and redirect the conversation to more enjoyable topics. Finally, since their emotional attachment to the person they were caring for made it difficult to deprive them of personal freedoms, caregivers wanted robots to act as neutral third parties in interactions and make the person cared for do things they did not want to do, for example take their medication, exercise, or stop eating unhealthy things.",

A recurring theme in the panel's conversation was the need for motivating children with autism to play with others, sustain their interest in collaborative play and offer them support for how to engage others. Using data from this panel as well as from a review of the literature, Robins et al. [19] then explored designing robots that could facilitate different types of play with therapeutic benefits for children with autism. The goal of the project was to design robots that empower children with special needs, to prevent isolation and build different skills including social ones.",

The functions that the robot has to fulfill and the capabilities it needs to have to provide effective social support for human-human interactions can be quite different from what is required of a robot for successful human-robot interaction alone.

HRI studies of robots intervening in human-human interactions vary widely in their scope, and are scattered across domains of application, using very different robot designs in a variety of context. Some are simply case studies (e.g., [26] ), others engage larger participant samples (e.g., [27] ), some studies investigate the effects of the robot in the context of specific tasks (e.g., [20] ), some leave the interaction free and open to what participants want to make of it, constrained just by the robot's capabilities (e.g., [28] ). Some of the robots used are designed with clinical applications in mind, such as assisting children with autism (e.g., [29] ) or providing couple's therapy (e.g., [30] ), but many of them are intended for general use, for purposes such as promoting inter-generational interactions (e.g., [31] ). Finally, some of these studies were conducted in lab settings (e.g., [27] ) while others in more naturalistic settings such as nursing homes (e.g., [32] ).

First, people with health conditions can have disability-specific difficulties in interacting with others. For example, people with Parkinson's Disease, a neuromotor disorder, might have difficulty in expressing emotions in conversations with others due to poor control of their facial muscles [33, 34] , while children with autism might have difficulty decoding the emotions of others in interactions [35] . Second, people with serious health conditions tend to be more dependent on others for daily functioning than their healthy peers and this can shape the types of interactions they have within a relationship. For example, people with severe health conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, in later stages, might need round-the-clock supervision and the extent to which they can make autonomous decisions about their lives and interactions with others can be limited [36] . Finally, there are types of social relationships that are unique to people with chronic health conditions, namely the relationships they form with healthcare professionals such as doctors and therapists, and their relationships with caregivers. These can pose specific challenges such as forming and sustaining fruitful therapeutic relationships [37] , and adjusting to the dynamics of caregiver-care recipient relationships, which can often be fraught with frustration on both sides. Given these special social circumstances of people with health conditions, we propose that SARs supporting humanhuman interactions can assist people with health conditions in their management of social life by fulfilling these functions (for a summary see Fig. 1 ):",

The way in which people with health conditions are perceived by others can have a major impact on their health. In the context of healthcare, how positive an impression a patient can make can directly affect how much care they receive. Studies have shown that doctors are more inclined to prescribe more care for more likable patients. However, doctors seem to be influenced by a patient's perceived traits at an unconscious level. For example, in a study of doctors making decisions about Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, the doctors ranked the patient's \"emotional state\" as an important consideration only 6 percent of the times. However, when a vignette described a hypothetical patient as being \"upbead and courageous\" as opposed to \"sad and discouraged\" the same doctors were three times more likely to recommend admission to ICU [39] . Other studies have similarly shown that \"likable and competent\" simulated patients elicited from doctors more recommendations for follow-up visits as well as more staff time spent on the patient's education [40] . Doctors are not the only ones influenced by patients' character attributes and affect. In a study of empathetic responses to naturally-varying affect in real hospital patients, participants (who were not medical professionals) watched videointerviews of chronically or terminally ill patients talking about their quality of life. Participants showed willingness to aid those patients displaying negative affect slightly more than those displaying positive affect, but patients showing little affect were offered the least amount of help (Fig.  2 ).

Chita-Tegmark et al. [41] conducted a vignette study in which robots partook in a conversation between a patient and a health-care provider: the robot gave a summary of the patient's treatment progress. In doing so, the robot used either task-centered language, emphasizing the patient's level of compliance to the treatment plan, or patient-centered language emphasizing the patient's choices and difficulties with regards to the treatment plan. Through its use of language, the robot was able to manipulate participants' impressions of the patient: in the patient-centered condition people perceived the patient more positively: they thought the patient was more competent, honest and self-disciplined rather than disruptive, hostile and disorganized. The same results were replicated in other contexts: dieting, learning how to dance or job training. Given how important it is for people with health conditions to be perceived in a favorable way by others, there is a great opportunity for SARs to positively impact these people's health through social support. SARs could contribute to interactions between people with health conditions and others in such a way that highlights the positive attributes of the person with the health condition. SARs could do this very subtly through choosing language that focuses on the person's agency, resilience, competence etc., like the study above has done.",

Additionally, creating opportunities to reflect on the creative overcoming of challenges caused by the health condition, instead of the impairments associated with it, can be a fruitful way of changing for the better the way the person with the health condition is perceived. This is especially important for interactions between patients and healthcare providers, which tend to be focused on the disease and its negative effects on the patient, with little room for discussing the patient's achievements and thus with little opportunity to observe the patient exhibit positive affect.",

In these situations, in which the health condition is the root cause of the misimpression, SARs could intervene by correcting misconceptions and alerting people to which behavioral cues are valid, and which are not. In the context of Parkinson's Disease, for example, SARs could instruct interactants to pay attention to what the person with Parkinson's Disease is saying as a better indicator of their personality and mood, rather than their facial expression, which is affected by the disease [44] . In addition to supporting others in forming better impressions of people with health conditions, SARs could also assist people with health conditions by compensating for a variety of social impairments caused by the health condition itself.",

The robot had a very simple design: a schematic face-like cover made of geometric shapes (circles for eyes and mouth, and triangle for nose) on top of a remote-controlled locomotion hardware, able to move forward, move back and swivel. An operator manipulated the robot wirelessly in the following way: if the child approached, the robot moved back; if the child moved away, the robot followed the child; and if the child was motionless, the robot turned itself around to grab the child's attention. After establishing an interaction with the robot, the child began to use the robot to express positive emotion, an interaction cue directed at the therapist. When the child interacted in a standalone manner with the robot, the positive emotion expression was quasi-absent, leading the authors to believe that the expression of enjoyment was the indication of a 'passage' from child-robot interaction to a child-therapist interaction. The authors interpret this as an indication that the child was using the robot as a tool for human-human interaction and that the interest elicited by the robot was an essential stepping stone for facilitating the interaction with another person. Robins et al. [29] described three case studies conducted with minimally verbal, low functioning children with autism. In the studies, a humanoid robot facilitated interactions between these low functioning autistic children and other people. Notable behaviors that the children engaged in included reaching for the experimenter's hand, which was surprising to both the experimenter, parent and therapist given the autism severity of the child. Another example of engaging in social behavior in the context of playing with the robot was exploring the teacher's eyes and face after exploring the robot's eyes and face as well as sharing excitement with the teacher by reaching out to her and asking her to join in the game. Finally, a child was gradually able to participate in an imitation game with the therapist taking turns controlling the robot and imitating the robot. Through this game the child learned to look at the therapist to see how she imitated the robot. Eventually the child was able to successfully engage in the same imitation game with another child. The authors argue that the robot allowed the children to demonstrate some interactional competencies and generalize this behavior to the co-present others.",

Arkin and Pettinati [48] have proposed the development of a robot co-mediator that would increase the emotional communicative bandwidth of the person with PD in such a way that would facilitate empathic response in a caregiver. The robot would express through body motions and postures the mental states of the person with Parkinson's Disease with the goal of eliciting empathy when incongruences arise between the mental state of the person with Parkinson's Disease and the other interactant.",

In relationships with others, especially with those that provide care, they can be seen almost exclusively through the lens of their needs, which can harbor dehumanization. Specifically, people with health conditions may be treated less like persons and more like objects or nonhuman animals [42, 49] . It is not that empathetic and humanizing care is not an aspiration of those providing it; in fact, it very much is, but often dehumanization ensues because of the need of health care providers and caregivers to create distance and emotional barriers to protect themselves from the emotional drain ensued by dealing with health care problems on a daily basis [42, 50, 51] . Caregiving relationships can be emotionally taxing and accompanied by frustration, thus in spite of best intentions, the social behavior of those providing care can often lack in empathy. However, empathy and humanization of care has been shown to be beneficial for health outcomes and many studies highlight the importance of empathy and patient-centered approaches in medical practice [52] [53] [54] . It has been proposed that admissions for medical school be based on empathy and emotional intelligence aptitudes [55] , and that training in empathetic behavior be required for health care professionals [56] . SARs could be used to support health care providers and caregivers when interacting with people with health conditions to ensure that dehumanization is avoided. Based on studies in HRI so far, we propose four main ways in which SARs could support the social behavior of health care providers and caregivers: (a) by raising awareness of one's social behavior and its effects on others, (b) by providing feedback that supports empathetic behavior, (c) by helping people set and maintain empathy goals for their interactions, and (d) by detecting and intervening when problematic interactions occur.",

However, oftentimes people remain oblivious to what they are doing and how it affects those around. Hoffman et al. [57] used an emoting and empathy-evoking robot, Kip1, to increase awareness of the effect of one's behavior in an interaction. The robot monitored nonverbal aspects of the conversation (speech, timing, silences and loudness) and responded with a gesture indicating curious interest when the conversation was calm and a gesture indicating fear when the conversation was aggressive. They used the robot as a peripheral companion in conflict conversations between couples. Couples were asked to discuss a topic they had high disagreement about in the presence of the robot. After the interaction, couples reported the same level of comfort in conversing next to the reactive robot as to the control, non-reactive robot which did not behave in response to their conversation. Also, couples attributed social human characteristics to the reactive robot. No quantitative data was reported on how the robot's reactions might have changed the conversation, but a qualitative account suggests that couples sometimes reacted to the robot's gesturing by adapting their own behavior, for example, pausing and taking the conversation in a different direction. Such capabilities in robots could also be used in the context of caregiving. This could assist health care providers and caregivers in monitoring their own social behavior and correcting unintended, dehumanizing or unempathetic aspects of the interaction.",

[58] used a Nao robot for providing real-time feedback to participants in a dyadic conversation. The Nao sensed and recorded conversational cues (e.g., number of natural turns, speaking percentage, interruptions etc.) and prosodic cues (e.g., amplitude) and then used machine learning algorithms to determine the social state of the participants (level of interest, agreement and dominance). Based on its model of the participants' state, Nao would alert the speakers when their voice was too high or too low or when the conversation was problematic due to too many disagreements or interruptions. The robot provided sociofeedback, alerts through speech accompanied by body postures in the following situations: when the conversation partners seemed uninterested in the discussion (\"You both seem uninterested.\"), when one person was speaking too much (\"You are talking a lot.\"), when one person was being too aggressive (\"Please calm down.\"), when someone's voice was too loud (\"Please lower your volume.\") or not loud enough (\"I am sorry, I cannot hear you.\") and when the conversation was proceeding normally (\"Good, carry on.\"). To validate the use of the robot as a social mediator, participants were asked to produce certain behaviors such as talk too loud, too much or to interrupt frequently. Participants felt that Nao's performance was good in terms of clarity: whom it was addressing and what it was saying. In terms of timing, some participants felt interrupted by the Nao. Most importantly participants indicated that they liked receiving socio-feedback from Nao and voted the Nao as their second favorite platform for receiving sociofeedback after virtual humans.",

The nature of the sociofeedback could be adjusted to the specific problems encountered by the caregiver and the robot could even act as an emotion regulation tool. Moharana et al. [17] recounts the desire of a caregiver who wanted a robot that could remind her that her husband's anger was not because of her poor care towards him but because of his dementia. Such reminders could be incorporated in the sociofeedback given during an interaction. Also, the sociofeedback need not be primarily negative. Activating positive social cognitions could be useful as well, for example the robot could point out how attentive the conversation partner is, how excited she is about the topic, or how much joy it brings her to be part of the interaction. Such cognitions could perhaps be empathy-inducing for the caregiver and humanize the person receiving care.",

Contrary to their hypothesis they found that group cohesion was higher in the performance-reinforcing rather than the performance equalizing-condition. Group performance was also higher in the performance-reinforcing condition. They also found that the more a robot spoke to a participant, the higher the group cohesion they reported and the more they helped the other participants in the group. Participants completed over half of the robot's suggestions, although as the authors note there are further opportunities for improving the timing and salience of the robot's suggestions.

Their approach was to focus on modifying the behavior of the person with the health condition, however, evaluative data from participants indicated that this might not be the preferred approach. The researchers implemented an intervening ethical governor model onto a robotic platform (the Nao robot), which models the relationship between the patient and caregiver, detects discordances between the patient's level of embarrassment and the caregiver's level of empathy, and intervenes through speech and movement to correct these gaps in communication and incompatibilities between emotional states. The researchers devised four different scenarios illustrative of four ethical rules of interacting: prohibition of angry outbursts from the patient, prohibition of withdrawal from the patient, obligation of the patient to stay in the therapeutic activity/session, and the obligation of the patient to follow safety requirements. Four videos were recorded of acted problematic interactions illustrating the intervention of a mediator robot who followed the rules above. Qualitative data was obtained from nine elderly participants who were shown the videos and who were guided through standardized open-ended interviews about the scenarios depicted in the videos. Participants felt that the most appropriate and essential type of intervention of the robot was the one corresponding to the \"safety-first\" rule, in which the robot made sure the patient follows safety requirements. Participants had a negative reaction to the robot's intervention in the other scenarios, feeling that the robot sounded judgmental, commanding and critical of patients, which was deemed unacceptable. In the videos, the robot always addressed the patient rather than the caregiver and the rules referred to the patient's behavior rather than that of the caregiver. Participants indicated that it would be more appropriate for the robot to indicate to the caretiver situations needing intervention.

An example, perhaps not of an appropriate intervention per se in the social management of health context, but of a study that has systematically attempted to compare human with robot intervention is [61] . Stoll et al. [61] studied the use of humor by robots for conflict mitigation. Humor has been shown to alleviate tension in interpersonal conflict, which makes it a commonly used strategy for diffusing conflict [62] . Participants watched videos of robots or humans using humor to diffuse a conflict situation between two roommates.

[23] offers an example of how a robot could intervene and guide the remediation of a problematic situation. Principles from this study could be extended and adapted to applications in the context of caregiver-care recipient relationships. Shen, Slovak and Jung used a mediator robot to support children in resolving interpersonal conflicts constructively. What is interesting about this robot is that its actions were programmed around formalized steps from a conflict negotiation procedure: Teaching Students to be Peacemakers (TSP). Examples of steps are: stating what you want and giving your underlying reason (\"I want\u2026be-cause\u2026\") or expressing how you feel (\"I feel mad or sad.\"). The robot facilitated the conflict resolution by identifying when a conflict was happening, alerting the children and then guiding them through the negotiation steps by using prompts matched to the protocol steps, such as: \"Telling each other what you want/how you feel can help. Can you try that?\". This robot was operated in a Wizard-of-Oz manner, so more development is needed in terms of making the robot autonomous and robust to the messiness of natural dialogue. Attention should be paid to proper timing and pacing so that the robot can intervene at the right time and follow an appropriate progression through the protocol steps. Using protocols for supporting interactions can, however, be a very fruitful approach for designing mediator robots, because of the scripted nature of conversation protocols, which are easier to handle by robots. Conversation protocols are good tools for structuring interactions. In the following section we summarize and expand on studies which have investigated how robots can provide structure to interactions through conversation protocols and other methods.",

It is thus valuable for SARs to create opportunities for people with health conditions to interact with others and participate fully in social life. Structuring social interactions in ways that make it easier for people with health conditions to join in and follow along is thus crucial. There are different levels, of increasing complexity, at which SARs could structure social interactions for people: (a) by serving as the focus of attention and anchoring the interaction, (b) by moderating an interaction, providing participation opportunities through speech and acts of encouragement, and overall promoting inclusiveness, and (c) by guiding people through standard interaction protocols or exercises.",

Additional data from this research project presented by Wada and Shibata [64] showed that the time residents spent in the public area increased after the introduction of Paro. Qualitative data suggest that residents who felt impaired in their communication due to speaking in a different dialect found Paro useful in breaking down this communication barrier and felt more comfortable talking to others. Additionally, caregivers and residents remarked that the topics talked about became more positive when Paro provided an anchoring for the conversation.",

Joshi and \u0160abanovi\u0107 [66] investigate the use of a variety of robots for stimulating intergenerational interactions in a nonfamilial setting: a co-located preschool and assisted living center for older individuals with dementia. They used four commercially available robots: Paro, Joy for All, Nao and Cozmo, which have different capabilities. Paro and Joy for All are pet-like robots that react to being held or stroked. Nao is a humanoid robot that can speak, move and track people, and Cozmo is a palm-held robot that can drive, speak in short sentences and express emotions. The experimenters worked in collaboration with the preschool and assistive living center staff to design activities that would lead to interactions between the residents and the preschoolers, customizing for the values and goals promoted by the center: increased inter-generational contact, increased peer engagement, meaningful interactions for both adults and children, opportunities to collaborate and share, and reduced need for outside management of the activity. By observing the behavior of the participants during the interactions, the experimenters found that activities involving robots were often able to provide more opportunities for intergenerational interactions than other types of activities such as drawing, puzzle solving and making music, and also required less intervention from staff members. The best robots for inter-generational interactions were Paro and Joy given their slow pace for responding which prevented older adults from getting overwhelmed and made the children impatient and inquisitive, giving the older adults opportunities to interact with the children. The Cozmo robot, although it facilitated peer interactions among children was not engaging for the older adults. The study is a great example of possibilities for introducing robots that can enhance interactions in real-world settings by working closely with the community members involved.",

[31] studied family groups as they played games with a robot, with the goal of improving intergenerational family interactions.

The robot had to detect the strength of the engagement between participants and identify the participant who had a side role. Then the robot intervened to include the unengaged participant. Videos were recorded of conversation scenarios and participants were asked to rate the appropriateness of the robot's behavior, the feeling of groupness and the timing of the robot's intervention. The robot intervened in the conversation either by directly addressing the participant who was left-out or by initiating a procedure: first addressing a comment to one of the engaged participants (i.e., claiming an initiative), waiting for a response (i.e., approval of the initiative) and then yielding the floor to the left-out participant.

For example, Utami and Bickmore [30] explored robot-driven couples counseling using a humanoid robotic head. The robot was operated in a Wizard-of-Oz manner and it guided couples through a rapport-building task and two counseling exercises: a gratitude exercise in which the couples were asked to recall and share three recent positive behaviors of their partner and the Caring Days exercises (commonly used in the Behavioral Couples Therapy) in which each partner made a request for a behavior that the other member of the couple could perform to show that they cared. The robot explained the rationale for the exercises, asked the couples to engage in the exercise and provided feedback. The study found a significant decrease in participant's negative affect post-intervention and a signifi-cant increase in self-reported intimacy. The couples indicated that they enjoyed the interaction with the robot and with each other and they rated their partner's responsiveness as high. Also, intimate behaviors such as touching and comforting were observed during the session. The post-session openended interviews revealed interesting insights about people's experience with the robot. Participants felt that the robot's responses were very generic and that the interaction was too structured, which could perhaps be improved in future iterations of the study by having the robot engage in some naturalistic, random behavior extraneous to the task. However, what is encouraging is that even though participants thought that a human counselor would be more genuine and better at understanding non-verbal behaviors (such as facial expressions) some participants felt that the advantage of the robot was its ability to stay non-judgmental and unbiased. Also, very promising is that participants indicated that the interaction with the robot was preferable to reading self-help material and practicing exercises by themselves. They recognized the robot as being helpful in structuring the interaction as a \"neutral third party\". Even couples who were familiar with the skills practiced with the robot liked being reminded of them. Using SARs for therapeutic exercises like these which could also be relevant for strengthening the bonds between caregivers and care recipients are very much in line with what participants in the study by Moharana et al. [17] expressed: a desire for robots to help accentuate positive shared moments with the person they were caring for and act as neutral parties to diffuse tension when unwanted tasks needed to be completed (e.g., adherence to treatment). Guidance through structured interactions can be used not just for creating positive connections but also for remedying strained ones. We have already discussed in the previous section the study by Shen et al. [23] which is an example of an interaction protocol for conflict resolution. Finally, robots can assist people assist others by guiding them through assistance-giving protocols. Many caregivers are family members, not trained professionals, and it can often be difficult for non-professionals to gauge the right amount of support needed by the person requiring care, so that their autonomy does not get impaired. Robots are far from being able to replace human caregivers altogether, not to mention that for most situations this is likely an undesirable goal. Therefore, the teaming of humans and robots in assistance-giving is the objective we are proposing. Robots can help structure assistance giving interactions between caregivers and care recipients. An example that doesn't come from the health care context, but from teaching, illustrates some possible functions for the robot: providing instructions for the task, assigning roles, and prompting the caregiver to offer different types of input that could be corrective feedback, praise, encouragement etc. Chandra et al. [22] compared a robot and a human facilitator of a collaborative learning activity. Children engaged in a learning-by-teaching task, in which one child taught the other how to write different letters or words. Either a robot or a human acted as facilitators by introducing the task, assigning roles (teacher or learner), providing instruction throughout the task and prompting the teacher-child to provide corrective feedback to the learner child. The video and audio recordings of the session were coded. Teacher-children provided more extended corrective feedback with the robot facilitator and more minimal corrective feedback with the human facilitator. Authors argue that the teacher-children felt more responsible regarding their performance in the presence of the robot. Combining these results with the duration of gaze that the facilitator directed towards the children (the robot made longer-duration gazes than the human facilitator) the authors conclude that two different patterns of interpersonal distancing emerged: in the case of the robot facilitator children followed the reciprocity model (responding to closeness with closeness), in the case of the human facilitator they followed the compensation model (responding to distancing with closeness).",

These ideas can be used to create SARs that help combat some of the negative effects of stigma. For example, behaviors of the robot used by Tennent et al. [71] , such as inviting people to join a conversation through movement, could be used for developing and testing robots that help people with health conditions feel welcomed and encouraged to participate in social interactions. Also, behaviors from the robot used by Mutlu et al. [24] , such as the use of gaze to suggest conversation roles, could be adapted to create feelings of inclusiveness for people with health conditions. An example of a robot specifically designed for influencing how a person feels in a social interaction with another human was tested by Pettinati et al. [76] . They used a social robot (Nao) for active listening. The robot was envisioned as a peripheral addition to an interaction between two people. The robot indicated active listening by turning its head towards the person speaking. Participants perceived the active robot as having more of a social presence than the controls (a non-active Nao and a plush toy) but participants felt equally comfortable self-disclosing in front of the active robot. The lack of a negative impact of the robot's presence for selfdisclosure is encouraging for the prospects of designing a mediator robot that does not detract from the interaction between humans. The absence of negative effects is a start, but further research is needed to establish whether the robot contributed any additional positive psychological effects of feeling listened to when disclosing personal information to another person.",

However, the health and well-being of the person with the health condition using the SAR is of primary importance, as this is the reason for developing SARs in the first place. The challenge with giving any type of assistance (but perhaps even more importantly when giving assistance through the use robots) is the preservation of the person's autonomy and dignity. Sharkey and Sharkey [78] , warned that careless use of assistive robots could lead to a loss of control of important aspects of one's life and feelings of objectification, and Wilson et al. [79] proppose that the concepts of autonomy and personal dignity, which are guiding ethical principles in occupational therapy, should be incorporated into the desgin process of social robots. Because people with health conditions are a vulnerable population, there is concern that robotic assistance would lead to a loss of personal liberty. One way in which this could happen is through overreliance on the robot, leading to enfeeblement and then dependence. If the robot completely takes over a certain task or important aspects of it (with regards to the robot functions proposed by this paper, one such task is the management of interactions) the worry is that people might lose the ability to perform the task themselves. For example, if a person becomes overly reliant on the robot alerting them to problematic nonveral aspects of a conversation (a function explored in Sect. 2.3.1) instead of using the robot's feedback to improve one's attention to cues from the interlocutor, this might lead to more problematic interactions in the future when the robot is not present. With some tasks this might be fine, as the person might have already lost that ability because of the health condition (for example, for severe dementia the function of redirecting conversation to non-repetitive topics might be needed for the remainder of the person's care), but with others, effortful attempts to maintain abilities might be desirable for independence. SARs involved in the social management of health should thus support rather than take over the task of initiating and sustaining interactions between people. As mentioned above, the right level of direction and assistance should be established through research.",

[80] Also, what obligations does that SAR have towards the different people that are part of the caregiving ecosystem? [81] This is an especially important consideration for the SAR functions that we propose in this paper. We are focusing on robots that can manage social interactions between people, and although the ultimate goal of the robot is to support the social management of health of the person with the health condition, precisely because it is a robot designed for supporting interactions between humans, the robot would serve multiple people, including health care providers, caregivers and other people belonging to the social circle of the person with the health condition. Also, given that health conditions can impair people's judgement, it is not always feasible that the authority over the robot and its use remains with the person with the health condition. In fact, in some situations it might be desirable that the robot itself exert authority over the person with the health condition. We learned from the study by Shim et al. [60] that people felt that the robot should never have the authority to judge patients. On the other hand, participants in the Utami and Bickmore study [30] welcomed the mild social pressure from the robot when the robot successfully prompted them to perform the therapeutic interaction exercises. Even more so, caregivers participating in the study by Moharana et al. [17] wanted a robot to have much more authority and adopt the role of a neutral third party who would determine the person receiving care to do things that they do not wish to do, but need to for their own good, for example, taking their medication. Some participants even envisioned that the robot would do this using the doctor's voice. The balance between assistance and autonomy should be decided preferably on a case by case basis and by taking into account the context. However, the functions we specify in this paper are very much subservient to the goals they try to achieve, which is not just preventing isolation, but also preserving autonomy and preventing dehumanization and stigma.",

SARs capitalize on the deeply ingrained human propensity to engage with lifelike social behavior and use this engagement for natural interaction with people [6] . Robots today can behave in lifelike, social ways, but they are neither alive nor do they actually feel any social emotions. But the person assisted by the robot, especially those who are struggling with cognitive impairments, can be tricked (much like children are), by the robot's behav-ior into believing the robot is something it is not. Especially when features such as touch (which would very likely be available in a healthcare robot) may amplify feelings of intimacy [83] . This could lead to the formation of unidirectional emotional bonds in which the person harbors feeling for the robot but the robot is ontologically unable to reciprocate [84] . This could be particularly problematic when the SAR is used for long periods of time and attachment is developed. As Sharkey and Sharkey, discuss, there are different levels of \"buying into\" the robot's behavior and acting \"as if\" the robot truly had social feelings, some of which are acceptable and some which border ethical concern. The functions we envision for SARs in this paper, namely that of supporting social interactions, could perhaps mitigate some of the concerns regarding deception and formation of problematic emotional bonds. In its most offending form, deception from SARs is when people start believing that the SAR is a companion that understands and shares their deepest feelings. The functions we propose for SARs shift the focus from the human-robot relationships to the human-human relationships, for which the robot simply offers support. The purpose of the robot intervening is not for it to offer companionship, but to optimize the ways in which people offer companionship to each other. Additionally, having another human in the loop (often the caregiver), can help with the supervision and correction of any problematic aspects of the relationship between the robot and the person assisted.",

This concern is especially pertinent to the function of SARs as providers of companionship. However, the vision presented in this paper, is quite the opposite. We suggest that SARs should adopt mediator roles and assist people with health conditions in their social management of health. We propose not for robots to diminish or replace human social contact, but on the contrary, to increase and enhance it. This paper thus proposes functions for SARs that are different from the ones evaluated by Sharkey and Sharkey, which focused on SARs assisting with daily tasks, monitoring behavior and health and providing companionship.",

            "text": "However, our vision is subject to a different concern: that mediator robots would inadvertently alter and negatively impact human-human interactions. A robot embedded in an interaction could detract from it by being an unwelcomed distraction [71] . Instead of focusing on each other, people would instead focus on the robot and change their interaction to accommodate the robot. A way to think about this issue is in terms of foregrounding or backgrounding of interactions by robots, and the amount of direction they offer [17] . Based on the specific needs of the interaction and of the interactants, the robot could take a peripheral role, subtly cueing people to potential opportunities or problems in their interactions, or a more leading role, directing the interaction between people. Moharana et al. suggest for example that in the early stages of dementia, and when the interaction is positive and satisfying for both the caregiver and the person receiving care, a mediator SAR could have a peripheral role in interactions. However, as the disease progresses and interactions become more frustrating, for example, because of agitation and forgetfulness, the robot could take on more the role of conversation partner in the interaction, taking over the stressful task of answering repetitive questions and providing redirection. However, it is important for the robot to not only intervene in negative situations, but also when it detects opportunities for positive social interactions, lest it be perceived as a \"watchdog\" and its interventions associated with unpleasant events [23] . In the sections above, we've seen examples of mediation from both peripheral robotic devices, such as the ones from Hoffman et al. [57] and Tennent et al. [71] , and also mediation from robots in leading roles, offering high amounts of direction such as those developed by Shen et al. [23] or Utami and Bickmore [30] . Further research is needed to establish the factors that should dictate the degree of robot involvement in an interaction. The factors proposed by Moharana et al., namely stage of health condition and positivity of interaction, are a good start, but more factors need to be tested, including but not limited to the preference and personality of the interactants or the type of interaction.",

As we've seen, Pettinati et al. [76] found promisingly that the robot's presence did not have any negative effects on self-disclosure when embedded in an interaction between two people, however more research is needed to establish that this is the case across contexts. Pettinati et al. only showed this in the context of a conversation between two strangers, an interviewer and an interviewee, not between, for example, people who know each other and have a long relationship history. On the other hand, the robot's presence might in some cases be more tolerable than that of another person. Participants in the couple's therapy study by Utami and Bickmore [30] indicated that it was easier for them to perform the exercises and disclose things in front of the robot than it would have been in front of a human therapist. More generally, Mutlu et al. [24] showed that robots can have an effect on how people feel about an interaction. Of course, this possibility is a great opportunity to use the robot's leverage to create positive interactions between people, but it is also a warning sign that unintended negative effects might also occur, and they should be carefully researched.",

It is important that the robot is seamlessly embedded in the social and cultural context. Cultural differences exist with regards to caregiving and illness [17] which result in different roles, degrees of autonomy, and experiences for the caregiver and the person being cared for. Also, different cultures may have different attitudes towards robots, their form and functions [85] . An example of how to ensure the robot fits the needs of the community it serves, is the study by Joshi and \u0160abanovi\u0107 [66] , which worked with the local community to better understand their goals in terms of integrating robots in the context of social interactions. For example, prior to designing the activities and introducing the robots, Joshi and \u0160abanovi\u0107, conducted extensive interviews with the staff at the preschool and the assistive living-dementia care center where the robots would be used. The interviews helped them identify the following community goal: to engage older adults and children in activities that were meaningful for both groups, with the purpose of facilitating relations similar to grandparents and grandchildren. The authors then systematically investigated the usefulenes of different robots for achieving this goal. They conclude that some robots were not well suited for what that community wanted. For example the Cozmo robot led to activities that were too fast-paced for the older adults, and which distracted the children from meaningful intergenerational engagement rather than facilitating interaction.",

Adaptability is important to keep pace with the progression of the health condition and the changing needs and contexts of the person assisted. In many of the studies discussed, the positive effect of the robot on social interactions stems from the robot being an interesting gadget that prompted people to interact with each other about it. However, we know little about what would happen once the novelty effect wears off. Ideally, the robot and its repertoire of interventions would continue to change over time both as technology progresses and as more research establishes new effective interventions. The SAR should also be personalized to the preferences and needs of the person using it [6, 17] . People react differently to different intervention styles. A major gap in the literature describing uses of robots as mediators of human-human interactions, is the lack of studies focusing on individual differences and how they modulate the robot's effect.",

The status of the mediator robot as something in between a tool and a social interaction partner needs to be given proper consideration. As mentioned above, features that subconsciously convey social signals and imply capabilities that the SAR does not have (such as touch conveying social bonding and a capability for affection) should be carefully researched before being implemented.

We summarized the research on how robots can modify the social behavior of people both for further enhancing positive interactions and for correcting negative ones. We surveyed the research studies that have used various levels of robot intervention to structure human-human interactions in both clinical and non-clinical settings. Finally, we exemplified through previous findings how people's feelings in a social context might be changed for the better by the introduction of a robot into the interaction. While reviewing the literature relevant for the mediator role for SARs, we have identified opportunities for further research and robot design. We discussed potential challenges in the design and use of SARs and showed that when the focus of the SAR's intervention is on the enhancement of the human-human interaction not on the replacement of caregivers, many of the general concerns with regards to SARs can be mitigated.
