For\nsubstrate binding, the protease adopted a residue pair (Glu-His) and a\nstable hydrogen bond formed by a conserved His and the substrate Gln to\nrecognize the conserved Gln in the P1 position of the substrate. For\ncatalysis, a conserved GSCGS motif was identified and shown to stabilize the\nactive site of the substrate and maintain the mobility of the catalytic\ncysteine side chain. In addition, a partial negative charge cluster (PNCC)\nformed by Arg-Tyr-Asp was proven to be essential for catalysis, via a remote\ninteraction mediated by a conserved water molecule. The distinctions between\nproteases from SARS and MERS were explored in terms of their catalytic\nefficiency. Furthermore, mutation studies were conducted to improve the\nenzymatic activity (8-fold), the inhibitor of MERS-CoV 3CLPro was\noptimized to improve the potency via introduction of a powerful hydrogen\nbond interaction between the inhibitor and the critical Q195 of MERS-CoV\n3CLPro. A potential allosteric inhibitory site was\nidentified. Hence, the results will help in the understanding of the\nenzymology, as well as de novo protein design and novel inhibitor\ndevelopment.",

However, the\ninextricable interaction between H175 and E169 made it reasonable to\nspeculate that H175 was indispensable for proteolytic bioactivity\n(Figure 3C).\nSubsequently, crippling the impregnable interactions by replacing H175\nwith Ala, Leu, Glu, and even Asn could remarkably reduce the enzymatic\nactivity, though the mutation of H175 to Gln, which shared a similar\nhydrogen bond donor feature to His, could retain the protease\nbioactivity (Figure 3D). The\nresults indicated that the hydrogen bond interaction between H175 and\nE169 was essential to the protease, which was in contrast to the\nprevious E169L mutant result (Figure 3B). Then, a multipoint mutant (E169L/H175L) was\ncreated, and this mutant expressed inferior catalytic activity (Figure 3D). To explain these\nunexpected results, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were applied to\nimitate the binding mode of the protease with the natural substrate,\nwhich was construed form the peptidomimetic aldehyde structure and\noptimized by MD simulation. As consequence, compared with WT, the\ndistance between residues 169 and 175 was remarkably enlarged in the\nmutant H175L and mutant E169L/H175L, while the mutant E169L displayed\nthe same distance as the WT protease (Figure S6), which hinted that redundant space may\nstrikingly affect protease catalytic activity in the H175L and mutant\nE169L/H175L. Following POVME script calculation, the results\ndemonstrated that the redundant space interfered with the fit between\nthe protease and substrate, which indicated that E169 mainly\ninteracted with the substrate through steric effects rather than\nelectrostatic interactions (Figure 3E).",

To unveil the underlying reason, the rotation of\nthe C148 thiol in the WT protease was further investigated and two\ntypical states (resting state and attacking state) were noticed in the\nMD simulations (Figure S15). In the resting state, the C148 thiol\npreferred to deviate from the substrate and interact with H166.\nConversely, the C148 thiol presented a suitable conformation, close to\nthe substrate in the attacking state.

In the G149A mutant, the\nsmaller A149 \u03c6 dihedral led to a compact conformation of A149\nand enhanced the rigid hydrogen bond between A149 and H166, which\nindicated that the translation of the C148-A149 main chain would\ndemand more energy to break the restriction of H166 to A149 in the\nG149A mutant (Figure 5D and\n5G).
