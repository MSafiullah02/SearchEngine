The etiologic agent of SARS was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) and sequence analysis reveals that the SARS-CoV is distinct from all known human coronaviruses [1], [2], [3]. The two previously identified human CoVs are associated only with mild upper respiratory tract diseases, whereas the novel SARS-CoV appears to be the first human coronavirus responsible for severe disease in humans [4], [5]. All CoVs encode a common set of structural components consisting of a nucleocapsid protein (N) and three integral membrane proteins, namely the spike protein (S), the membrane protein (M), and the envelope protein (E) [6], [7]. The S protein plays essential roles in mediating receptor binding and internalization of the virus and is one of the major antigens of the virus [8]. The M and E proteins are essential for virion assembly, and the N protein binds to a defined packaging signal on viral genome RNA, leading to the formation of the helical nucleocapsid [6], [7].",

It is believed to have evolved as a host defense mechanism directed at transposable elements and infectious viruses. Many studies have proved that siRNA can significantly suppress gene expression when exposed to mammalian cells in vitro [12], [13], [14]. Moreover, a number of groups demonstrated effective silencing of both endogenous gene and transgene expression in vivo [15], [16], [17], [18]. These findings raised the possibility that RNAi might advance the field of therapeutic approaches for virus infection. In this study, we screened an expression cassette-based siRNA that targets at the N sequence of SARS-CoV, and it can significantly suppress the expression of SARS-CoV N protein in cultured cells in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, the siRNA expression vector was constructed and proved to be effective in silencing the expression of SARS-CoV N protein in adult mouse muscles.",

The selected siRNA target sites were shown in Table 1\n. The S1184 target site is specific for SARS-CoV S gene, and muN388 target site is a mutant sequence for N388, in which bi-nucleotides of the 6th site C and 7th site G are reversed from N388. Both of the S1184 and muN388 were served as controls for analysis of the specificity of the siRNA. PCR based siRNA expression cassettes, containing U6 promoter, a 19\u201321-nt sense strand of siRNA, a 9-nt loop, a 19\u201321-nt antisense strand of siRNA, and a stretch of six deoxythymidines (poly(T)6), were amplified by a two-step PCR described by Castanotto [19] and Gou [20] (Fig. 1\n). The 5\u2032 primer mU6F 5\u2032-GAATTGGGTACCCGCTCTAG-3\u2032, is complementary to 20 nt at the 5\u2032 end of the murine U6 promoter and was used for all PCR procedures. In the first round of PCR, the plasmid pSilence1.0-U6 containing mouse U6 promoter (Ambion) was used as template, and the reverse primers contain the 9-nt loop (5\u2032-TTCAAGAGA-3\u2032), a 19\u201321-nt antisense sequence of siRNA target site and the complementary sequence to the last 14 nts of the mouse U6 promoter (5\u2032-GCCTTGTTTGGGCC-3\u2032). The PCR amplification using Pfu DNA Polymerase was carried out as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 4 min; 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 58 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 40 s, 30 cycles; 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. One microliter of the first PCR product was re-amplified using the mixture of Taq and Pfu DNA Polymerase. The amplification conditions and forward primer were the same as those in the first round PCR, while the reverse primers contain poly(A)6, a 19\u201321-nt sense strand of siRNA target site, and a complementary sequence to the 9-nt loop. In addition, the mouse U6 promoter was amplified as a control for siRNA screening. The second round PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). All the reverse primers were listed in Table 1.",

In this study, four siRNA candidate sites targeting SARS-CoV N sequence were selected, and mouse U6 promoter regulated siRNA expression cassettes were constructed. All four candidate siRNAs gave some reduction of EGFP expression in cultured cells, and N388 showed the most significant effect. Western blot demonstrated the similar inhibitory effect on N protein and EGFP, and the semi-quantitative PCR confirmed that N388 down-regulated mRNA of N gene more efficiently than other three siRNAs did. For gene intervention, sequence specificity is very important for its practical application. It is know that, in mammalian cells, dsRNA 30 base pairs or longer can trigger interferon responses that are intrinsically sequence-nonspecific [21], [22], [23]. In our observation, the control PCR products, including the U6 promoter, SARS-CoV S-targeted siRNA expression construct, have little influence on the N-EGFP expression. More importantly, the bi-nucleotide reversed mutant of N388 siRNA had no inhibitory activity for N-EGFP expression. These results indicate that the inhibition of N-EGFP expression by siRNAs is sequence-specific, requiring homology between the siRNAs and gene targets, and is not the consequence of interferon responses induced by dsRNA.",

In cultured cells, this plasmid could significantly suppress N-EGFP expression in a dose-dependent manner, while the expression of another viral protein, HBcAg, did not change. As the expression of both N-EGFP and HBcAg are driven by the same transcriptional control element (CMV immediate/early promoter/enhancer) and that down-regulation of viral RNA by cytokines is not sequence-specific, our results suggest that the inhibitory effect of siRNA or the SARS-CoV N expression is not due to IFN response, but sequence-dependent siRNA mechanism. To determine the potential biological activities of siRNA in vivo, we established a mouse model expressing N-EGFP in skeletal muscles. Muscle cells are excellent for exogenous gene expression, for example, direct intramuscular DNA vaccine injection could lead to antigen expression in muscle cells and induction of systemic immune responses in hosts [24]. Analysis on protein and mRNA levels showed that just as in cultured cells, the siRNAs could down-regulate N and EGFP expression in mouse muscles, and their effects lasted the entire observation period. Though Lower dose of siRNA develop less suppression activities on N and EGFP expression, they still behave significant inhibition. When 0.4 \u03bcg, instead of 0.6 \u03bcg pU6-shN388 was administered, the mRNA of N gene was reduced to 28%, 24%, 31%, and 36% at different time points, respectively (data not shown). Although we have not evaluated the activities of the siRNA in respiratory tract, of the relevant target for SARS-CoV infection, the siRNA seems to be functional for silencing N protein expression in vivo based on the data from mouse muscles and the cultured cells, especially from Vero E6 cells, which is supportive for SARS-CoV replication. The siRNAs are promising for the development of antiviral agents for human use, especially when combining several siRNAs specific for different gene regions, and delivering with an appropriate carrier, such as cationic polymers [25] or virus vectors, or with proper modification, such as linkage with cholesterol [26]. For the characterization of SARS-CoV infection, the recombinant vaccinia virus vector may be an attractive alternative for siRNA delivery. Recently, the siRNAs targeting the polymerase and S sequence were reported to silence gene expression and inhibit SARS-CoV replication in mammalian cells efficiently [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Together with our data, it is considerable that siRNA may be possible for developing anti-SARS agents.",

The inhibitory activity and durable effects of siRNA N388 on N expression were further confirmed in mouse muscles. Our present data suggest that siRNA should be of potential values in prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV infection in humans.",
