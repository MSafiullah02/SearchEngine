            "text": "\nNanotechnology is the study, design, creation, synthesis, manipulation, and application of materials, devices, and systems at the nanometer scale (one meter consists of 1 billion nanometers) [1]. Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to \u201cnanotech\u201d) is the study of manipulating matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally nanotechnology deals with structures sized between 1 and 100 nm in at least one dimension and involves developing materials or devices within that size. Much of the study of nanoscience relates to the phenomenon of self-assembly in which nanoscale building blocks self-assemble to form complex structures. Microbiology relates to nanoscience at a number of levels. Many bacterial entities are nanomachines in nature, including molecular motors like flagella and pili. Bacteria also form biofilms by the process of self-assembly (e.g., the formation of Curli-film by Eschericia coli). The formation of aerial hyphae by bacteria and fungi is also directed by the controlled and ordered assembly of building blocks. In addition, the formation of virus capsids is a classical process of molecular recognition and self-assembly at the nanoscale. Another completely different aspect is the use of nanoordered bacterial assemblies for nanotechnology. Nanoscience impacts several areas of microbiology. It allows for the study and visualization at the molecular assembly level of a process and facilitates identification of molecular recognition and self-assembly motifs and the assessment of these processes. These are relevant to many microbial processes as mentioned above.\n",

Interest is booming in biomedical applications for use outside the body, such as diagnostic sensors and \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d techniques, which are suitable for analyzing blood and other samples, and for inclusion in analytical instruments for R&D on new drugs. For inside the body, many companies are developing nanotechnology applications for anticancer drugs, implanted insulin pumps, and gene therapy. Other researchers are working on prostheses and implants that include nanostructured materials. Nanotechnology applications have not been marketed long enough for claims to be corroborated about risks to human health and environment. Still, small nanoparticles can enter the human body through pores and may accumulate in cells. The health effects of such nanoparticles are unknown. Historical experience with unintended consequences of technologies, such as drug resistance to antibiotics, or the persistence of chemicals, such as DDT in the environment, teaches us to take precautions.",

When they detect signs of the disease, thin wires in their walls emit an electrical pulse which causes the walls to dissolve and the drug to be released. A great advantage of using nanobots for drug delivery is that the amount and time of drug release can be easily controlled by controlling the electrical pulse [5]. Furthermore, the walls dissolve easily and are therefore harmless to the body. Elan Pharmaceuticals has already started using this technology in their drugs Merck\u2019s Emend and Wyeth\u2019s Rapamune [6]. Nanomedicine could make use of these nanorobots (e.g., Computational Genes), introduced into the body, to repair or detect damages and infections. Using nanotechnology, the drug can be targeted to a precise location which would make the drug much more effective and reduce the chances of possible side effects. In the future, these nanorobots could actually be programmed to repair specific diseased cells, functioning in a similar way to antibodies in our natural healing processes.",

Silver attacks multiple sites within the cell to deactivate critical physiological functions such as cell wall synthesis, membrane transport, nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) synthesis and translation, protein folding and function, and electron transport. For certain bacteria, as little as one part per billion of silver may be effective in preventing cell growth [18].

This helical stacking can be seen in the height, phase, and error signal channels (Figure 21.13\n). One significant advantage of using a BioAFM, such as the JPK Nanowizard\u00ae, to image biological samples is that the imaging can be conducted in fluid. As such, virus particles can be imaged on the surface of their target cells in fluid. Here, influenza virus has been imaged, attached to the surface of red blood cells, in fluid, using intermittent contact mode. The virus particles are clearly imaged at the surface of the cells (Figure 21.14\n).",

Morphogenesis of enamel proceeds through interaction between nanospheres or nanofibers of amelogenin, the main protein of the developing enamel matrix, and the growing crystals of apatite [29]. With the advancement of real-time nanoscale visualization techniques [30], [31], there is a prospect that a clearer picture of these highly dynamic phenomena that govern the formation of dental and other biological tissues can be visualized. Fostering understanding of the dynamical nature of enamel should thus give rise to finer reparative techniques.

Although the spaces are too small to allow for bacterial penetration, they are large enough for enzymes and water to enter and cause degradation of resin/dentin bonds over time. The original interpretation of nanoleakage was that the silver dye used for the leakage studies occupied nanometer-sized spaces around naked collagen fibrils, where resin failed to infiltrate, or where residual water had not been displaced by the adhesive resin [41].

Nowadays, the most commonly used resin composites, i.e., microhybrids and nanofilled composites, comprise filler particles ranging from ~20 to 600 nm. Other dental nanotechnologies rely on the delivery of molecules that facilitate tooth structure remineralization by means of noninvasive dental techniques that forestall caries, the latter being an active area of nanoresearch in dentistry. In agreement with Saunders [42], the most tempting venue for speculation on the next phase of nanorestoration of tooth structure is biomimetics, i.e, mimicking processes that occur in nature [43], [44].",

Containing biomarkers for various diseases, the identification of which is currently under investigation, saliva holds great promises for early detection of disease and/or monitoring therapeutic outcomes through a noninvasive approach [56]. Other oral components, such as gingival crevicular fluid, epithelial cells, breath, and dental plaque, also have diagnostic potential [57]. The future of dentistry will thus undoubtedly witness routine and mechanistic restorations ceding place to a more holistic clinical practice where each particular case is analyzed in the context of the organism as a whole.",

Despite the seemingly slow development of the dental field, we should keep in mind that scientific fields develop in waves. Computer science has rapidly expanded in the previous two decades or so, whereas the theoretical physics set the quantum mechanical fundaments for its slow subsequent development in only a few decades at the turn of the twentieth century. Let us hope that one such big breaking wave is on the horizon for the world of dental science. In our opinion, to surf on that promising wave, learning the art and know-how offered by modern nanotechnologies will be a must.\n",

Upon reaching the dentin, nanorobots enter 1\u20134 \u03bcm diameter dentinal tubule holes and proceed toward the pulp, guided by a combination of chemical gradients, temperature differentials, and positional navigation, all under onboard nanocomputer control. Assuming a ~10 mm total path length from tooth surface to pulp, a very modest nanorobot travel speed of 100 \u03bcm/s completes the journey into the pulp chamber in ~100 s.

After the oral procedures are completed, the dentist orders the nanorobots (via the same acoustic data links) to restore all sensation, to relinquish control of nerve traffic, and to egress from the tooth by similar pathways used for ingress, followed by aspiration.

At the same time, continual refinement of traditional methods, development of advanced restorative materials, and new medications and pharmacologic approaches will continue to improve dental care. Nanotechnology is still in its early stages. A few applications discussed in this chapter have already been developed and are already helping patients all over the world. As further research continues in this field, more treatment methodologies will be discovered. Many diseases that do not have a cure today may be cured by nanotechnology in the future. Some of the concerns were also discussed, but with proper care these problems can be avoided. Scientists who are against the use of nanotechnology also agree that advancement in nanotechnology should continue because this field promises great benefits, but testing should be carried out to ensure the safety of the patients.
