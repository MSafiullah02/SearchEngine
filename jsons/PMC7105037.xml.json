On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert level to phase 6, indicating widespread community transmission.1 In Taiwan, the first patient with H1N1v infection was identified on May 20, 2009, and large-scale community infection followed.2 The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of H1N1v infection differ between countries. Compared with western countries, it was found that the first 61 patients with H1N1v in Taiwan had a lower incidence of fever, diarrhea and vomiting.3 It is believed that the presentation of influenza infection is relatively atypical in children and this makes it more difficult to make an accurate diagnosis.4\n",

In addition, adolescents are more able to describe their influenza-like symptoms, and they do not seek medical consultation if they only have mild discomfort. In contrast, toddlers and infants suffer from a lower risk of influenza cluster infection, and they are more susceptible to other viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus.8 Sampling of oropharyngeal swab was suffering, and it was more difficult to obtain specimen with good quality in younger patients.

The sensitivity of these antigen rapid tests is around 40\u201369%.9 The low sensitivity leads to a poor positive predictive value in clinical application and thus the diagnosis is made mainly upon the physician\u2019s judgment.9 There are several brands of commercial IRT kits available in Taiwan. We use the commercial Quickvue A+B influenza tests whose sensitivity is only 51.0%, but the specificity of this kit is good for both H1N1v and seasonal influenza virus (99.0%).10 We designed a simple scoring system to predict the results of IRT, but the unsatisfactory sensitivity of the antigen rapid test may limit its clinical application. Besides the different brand of commercial kit, the sensitivity of the rapid test is also influenced by several factors, such as clinical judgment, the method of sampling, viral load and background prevalence of influenza.11 According to the data of CDC, Taiwan, during our study period, about 30% of patients with ILI had influenza infection, including children and adults, and >90% of them had H1N1v.2 The sensitivity and specificity of our scoring system may change over time and between areas, and may be different in children and adults.

Patients infected by H1N1v may be afebrile, therefore, even some well people asked for influenza evaluation.

Therefore, further wide application of this kind of scoring system is warranted for it to be established as a more exact diagnostic tool. RT-PCR is more reliable but widespread use has been unrealistic until now. That is why we did not choose RT-PCR as the reference diagnostic tool. Second, the clinical manifestations and the accuracy of the scoring system can only represent the situation in this area during this period. The cut-off value of scoring system should be modified according to the epidemiology and government policy in different areas. Third, H1N1v and other seasonal influenza A virus infections can not be distinguished by the rapid tests, nor by the scoring system.
