Blood, brain, and spinal cords were collected for further analysis. The brains were washed with PBS and photographed. The spinal cords were weighed and homogenized in PBS (0.5 ml/spinal cord) and centrifuged (14,000 g, 2 min). A sample of the clarified supernatant was used to determine total protein concentration with a Bio-Rad kit. In parallel, 0.3 ml of the clarified supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of 15% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged (10,000 g, 10 min). After the addition of 0.125 ml of 5 M NaOH to 0.5 ml of the supernatant, the fluorescence was determined by using a Fluorolog fluorimeter (SPEX) at 437 nm excitation and 508 nm emission. Sodium fluorescein standards (50\u20131000 ng/ml) were used to determine fluorescein contents in the samples. Blood was centrifuged and the levels of fluorescein in the sera were determined as above. Fluorescein uptake from the circulation into the spinal cord tissue is expressed as (\u03bcg fluorescence spinal cord tissue/mg protein)/(\u03bcg fluorescence sera/\u03bcl blood) to normalize values for blood levels of the marker [31].",

Brains and spinal cords were removed and kept in 10% buffered formalin (16\u201318 h). Tissue sections were paraffin-embedded and coronal sections (3 \u03bcm) were obtained and affixed onto slides. The slides were sequentially deparaffinized, rehydrated, and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Then, the antigens were retrieved by incubating the slides at 100\u00b0C with citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 1 min in a pressure cooker (in the case of anti-nitrotyrosine and Mac-2) or with Tris\u2013EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, for 1 min in a vegetable steamer (for anti-iNOS). Finally, the slides were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in PBS/0.1% BSA. The employed antibodies and dilutions were mouse monoclonal to nitrotyrosine (Abcam, UK; 1:400), rabbit polyclonal to iNOS (Abcam; 1:1500), and monoclonal anti-mouse Mac-2 (Cedarlane, Canada; 1:50,000). After extensive washing with 0.5% TBS\u2013Tween, the sections were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber with Novolink Max Polymer (Novocastra, UK) according to the instructions of the manufacturer for anti-nitrotyrosine and anti-iNOS antibodies.

Briefly, a television camera from the microscope acquired the image. The fields were selected within the brain regions of cortical areas, amygdaloid nuclei, hippocampus, and corpus callosum, bilaterally. The size of the sampled fields was 8.96 \u00d7 104 \u03bcm2 (40\u00d7) for cortical areas, amygdaloid nuclei, and hippocampus and 1.21 \u00d7 104 \u03bcm2 (63\u00d7) for corpus callosum. After shading correction, the following discrimination procedure was performed. The mean value of the gray matter (MGV \u00b1 standard error) in areas of the brain devoid of specific labeling was taken as the background. Gray values darker than the background were considered to correspond to specific labeling and discriminated. The specific MGV was taken as the difference between the specific and the background values. The glass value was left constant at 200 MGV. The morphometric (area) and the microdensitometric measurements (specific MGV) indicate the amount of immunopositive profiles in the sampled fields. Only the area of immunolabeling was presented.",

The protocols for IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, CD4, CD8, and \u03b2-actin transcript detection were as follows: in the case of IFN-\u03b3, pre-denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 4.5 min and cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 20 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s (repeated for 35 cycles) and a final end extension of 1 min at 72\u00b0C; for TNF-\u03b1, pre-denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 4 min and cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 20 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s (repeated for 34 cycles) and a final end extension of 1 min at 72\u00b0C; for CD4 and CD8, pre-denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min and cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 36 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 s (repeated for 40 cycles); and for \u03b2-actin, pre-denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min and cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 45 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 45 s, and extension at 75\u00b0C for 45 s (repeated for 33 cycles) and a final end extension of 1 min at 72\u00b0C. The following primers were used for PCR amplification: IFN-\u03b3 primer (up, 5\u2032-GCTCTGAGACAATGAACGCT-3\u2032, and down, 5\u2032-AAAGAGATAATCTGGCTCTGC-3\u2032, 227 bp) [34]; TNF-\u03b1 primer (up, 5\u2032-TCTCATCAGTTCTATGGCCC-3\u2032, and down, 5\u2032-GGGAGTAGACAAGGTACAAC-3\u2032, 212 bp) [35]; CD4 primer (up, 5\u2032-TCCTTCCCACTCAACTTTGC-3\u2032, and down, 5\u2032-AAGCGAGACCTGGGGTATCT-3\u2032, 200 bp); CD8 primer (up, 5\u2032-GCTCAGTCATCAGCAACTCG-3\u2032, and down, 5\u2032-ATCACAGGCGAAGTCCAATC-3\u2032, 200 bp) [36]; and \u03b2-actin primer (up, 5\u2032-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3\u2032, and down, 5\u2032-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3\u2032, 348 bp) [37]. PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 \u03bcg/ml). Relative quantification of the transcripts was performed by densitometry (ImageQuant version 5.2; Molecular Dynamics).",

Thus, we started by examining the characteristics of the MHV-59A infection in our experimental settings. SPF female C57BL/6 mice (n\n = 12) received PBS (ip) as a surrogate for the ulterior tempol treatment and intracranial inoculation of MHV-59A (500 pfu) and were maintained under observation. One day after infection, 50% of the animals showed mild neurological symptoms, such as piloerection, hunched posture, and lethargy (score 1) (Fig. 1A). Between 2 and 4 days after inoculation, some mice improved, but at least 70% showed moderate to severe neurological symptoms, such as hind- or fore-limb weakness/paresis (score 2) or hind- or fore-limb paralysis and ataxic gait (score 3). Between 6 and 8 days after infection, 30% of the mice died. Ten days after inoculation, 90% of the mice had died, and the survivors still presented neurological symptoms that persisted up to 60 days (Fig. 1A). Histopathological analysis of brain tissues collected 7 days after inoculation showed massive inflammatory cellular infiltration throughout forebrain gray and white matter regions (Fig. 1B). Inflammatory foci that were accumulating increased amounts of infiltrating cells were evident in gray matter regions, such as neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and diencephalon, and also in white matter structures, such as the lateral regions of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, anterior commissure, and fornix. Moreover, perivenous cuffing was particularly seen in the white matter clusters, mainly associated with perivenular disruption of the myelin staining by Weil (Fig. 1B). Thus, we confirmed that MHV-A59 infection of SPF female C57BL/6 mice models certain of the aspects of the CNS inflammation associated with MS [5], [6], [7], being useful to test the effects of tempol treatment.",

This was confirmed by EPR analysis of brain homogenates of sham and MHV-59A-infected mice sacrificed 10, 15, or 25 min after tempol administration (24 mg/kg; ip; Fig. 2\n). As is usual in biological fluids and tissues, most of the tempol was present in its reduced form, the corresponding hydroxylamine. Indeed, the characteristic EPR signal of tempol became noticeable upon addition of ferricyanide to the homogenates [29]. Total tempol (nitroxide plus hydroxylamine) levels decayed quickly in vivo, attaining about 0.3 \u03bcM in brain 25 min after administration. Maximum levels (about 15 \u03bcM) were measured 10 min after administration in sham mice. The lower levels of total tempol detected in infected mice (about 3 \u03bcM after 10 min) are consistent with the course of infection producing radicals that are able to react with tempol to generate redox inactive products [29].",

For example, the neurological symptoms and CNS infiltration and demyelination were greatly reduced (Fig. 3\n), and mouse survival was significantly increased (Fig. 4\n). Indeed, histopathological analysis of the forebrain regions of tempol-treated mice revealed a dramatic reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration throughout the forebrain gray and white matter regions. In addition, perivenous accumulation of inflammatory cells and disruption of the Weil's myelin stain were substantially reduced (compare Figs. 1B and\n3B). Whereas 90% of untreated mice died at 10 days after infection, 70% of the mice treated with tempol survived (Fig. 4) and about half of them displayed the behavior of normal mice (Fig. 3A). These striking effects were obtained with tempol administration (24 mg/kg; ip) in two doses on the first day (5 min before and 2 h after MHV-A59 inoculation) and in daily doses for 7 days; the animals also received tempol (2 mM) in the drinking water ad libitum [29]. No adverse effects of this treatment were observed in uninfected mice (Fig. 4). Previously, we have shown that tempol administered in the drinking water was distributed to tissues but we did not examine CNS tissues [29]. Now, we determined the levels of total tempol (tempol plus hydroxylamine) in the brain, spinal cord, and plasma of mice receiving 2 mM tempol in the drinking water. These levels were similar and around 0.3 \u03bcM (data not shown).",

            "text": "In addition to the loss of blood\u2013brain barrier integrity, CNS inflammation is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of MS. Thus, we complemented the histopathological analysis of CNS tissues of MHV59A-infected mice (Figs. 1B and\n3B) with immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analysis of markers of inflammation. Immunohistochemical analysis of the brain (Fig. 6\n) and spinal cord (data not shown) tissues showed that viral infection resulted in macrophage infiltration, iNOS expression, and protein nitration, all of which were greatly attenuated by tempol treatment. In some brain sections of infected mice, activated glial cells strongly staining for nitrated proteins were noticeable (Fig. 6, bottom left). Semiquantitative image analysis of the immunostaining of the brain tissues revealed that treatment with tempol reduced macrophage infiltration, iNOS expression, and 3-nitrotyrosine levels to about 4, 26, and 16% of those of untreated mice, respectively (Fig. 7A). Quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine levels in the spinal cords of the animals by immune slot blot confirmed that tempol inhibited its levels to about 12% of those of untreated mice (Fig. 7B). Treatment with tempol also greatly reduced the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNAs in the spinal cords of the animals as assessed by RT-PCR (Fig. 7C). These cytokines can be produced by T cells, which are involved in the immune and inflammatory response during viral encephalomyelitis [reviewed in 6,7]. Thus, we also quantified the levels of CD4 and CD8 mRNA in the spinal cords and spleens of the animals. Treatment with tempol decreased the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes into the spinal cords, although only the differences in CD8 mRNA levels were statistically significant (Figs. 8A and 8C\n). Tempol did not alter the levels of CD4 and CD8 transcripts in the spleen (Fig. 8A), indicating a preserved immune status of the treated animals. Naive mice presented lower levels of CD4 and CD8 transcripts (Fig. 8B) than infected animals (Fig. 8A), as can be inferred from the relative intensity of the corresponding CD4, CD8, and \u03b2-actin bands. These results demonstrate that tempol strongly inhibited the CNS inflammation of MHV-59A-infected mice (Fig. 1, Fig. 3, Fig. 6, Fig. 7) without compromising their immune system (Fig. 8).",

Treatment with tempol attenuated these neurological symptoms and increased survival up to 70% (Figs. 3A and\n4). Notably, half of the survivors behaved as normal mice, at least when kept at a low dose of tempol in the drinking water (2 mM). Not surprisingly, treatment with tempol substantially preserved the integrity of the CNS (compare Figs. 1B and\n3B), including the BBB (Fig. 5).",

This indicates that the infectious process generates a considerable amount of radicals, some of which are able to react with tempol to produce redox-inactive products [29]. Consequently, tempol altered the redox status of the infectious environment (Fig. 2). On the other hand, it is being increasingly recognized that the redox status of extra- and intracellular microenvironments influences the outcome of infectious/inflammatory processes [41], [42], [43]. Thus, it is likely that tempol attenuated the CNS inflammatory response and ameliorated viral encephalomyelitis (Figs. 1 and\nFig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8) by altering the redox status of the infectious environment (Fig. 2). In this regard, our study supports the argument that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of tempol are likely to be interrelated [29], [38], [44].",

At the phenomenological level, tempol has been previously shown to display anti-inflammatory properties in mouse models of infectious/inflammatory diseases. For instance, tempol administration decreased the levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and inhibited NF-\u03baB activation in mice subjected to carrageenan-induced pleuritis [44] and inhibited iNOS expression in murine leishmaniasis [29]. In the case of the MHV-59A-infected mice, treatment with tempol reduced the levels of iNOS protein (Figs. 6 and\n7) and viral load into the CNS (Table 1). This reduction in viral load contrasts with our previous observation that in reducing iNOS expression and protein nitration in murine leishmaniasis, tempol increases parasite load in cutaneous lesions [29].",

In contrast with most bacteria and parasites, virus cannot be confined to limited areas by the nonspecific host defense mediated by phagocytes and their mediators. In consequence, nitric oxide-derived oxidants are more likely to cause nonspecific nitro-oxidative damage in virus-infected tissue than to eliminate the virus [47], [48], [49]. Accordingly, it has been reported that infection of iNOS knockout (\u2212/\u2212) and iNOS (+/+) mice with MHV resulted in similar kinetics of virus clearance, but in reduced neuronal apoptosis and mortality [50]. We did not follow the kinetics of virus clearance in our experimental setting, but we did show that 7 days after infection, tempol reduced viral load, iNOS expression, and CNS damage. Thus, it is feasible that by decreasing nitro-oxidative stress, tempol attenuates the mutation rate of the virus, precluding evolution of mutants able to escape the antiviral immune responses of the host [45], [46]. Additionally, tempol may inhibit virus entrance into host cells by altering the redox state of the cells and of their surface proteins. Indeed, there are previous studies showing that viral infection and replication are dependent on the redox status of infectious microenvironments [41], [42].",

            "text": "Taken together, our results indicate that tempol ameliorates murine viral encephalomyelitis by altering the redox status of the infectious environment that contributes to an attenuated CNS inflammatory response (Figs. 1 and\nFig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Thus, our study argues for the interrelatedness of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of tempol [29], [38], [44]. This cross talk, however, remains to be examined at the molecular level. With regard to therapeutic implications, it is important to note that the natural antioxidant uric acid has been shown to be quite effective in ameliorating EAE by inhibiting CNS inflammation, BBB dysfunction, and tissue damage [8], [12], [51], [52]. This discovery motivated the initiation of clinical trials with inosine, a metabolic precursor of uric acid. Oral administration of inosine increases uric acid levels in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, whereas an oral dose of uric acid is mostly degraded by uricase in the gastrointestinal tract. The ameliorating effects of uric acid in EAE have been attributed to its ability to scavenge nitric oxide-derived oxidants [8], [12], [51], [52]. In comparison, tempol is more effective than uric acid in scavenging nitric oxide-derived oxidants [9], displays low toxicity in animal models [15], [16], permeates the blood\u2013brain barrier (Fig. 2), and inhibits the enzyme myeloperoxidase ([20]; see Augusto et al., [53], which has been recently associated with MS [54], [55]. In this context, the reported ameliorating effects of tempol on viral murine encephalomyelitis provide support for the development of therapeutic strategies based on nitroxides to manage neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS.",
