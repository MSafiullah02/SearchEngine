They are the Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), Phocidae (true seals), and Odobenidae (walrus) families. Common and scientific names of species described in this chapter are presented in Supplemental Table e1. Much of the knowledge on pathologic conditions of pinnipeds comes from necropsies of stranded animals and those housed in captivity. As such, disease knowledge is biased toward species frequently housed in zoos and aquaria, those that strand more commonly, or those in which free-ranging populations are more easily accessible.",

Their organ systems broadly resemble those of the terrestrial carnivores from which they evolved, with modifications for their aquatic lifestyle. The most pronounced differences are in the lungs, skin, and vasculature, with minor modifications in the spleen and liver. Many adaptations are associated with the physiological demands of prolonged diving, including an increased requirement for oxygen stores, protection from pressure effects, and insulation/thermoregulation at low temperatures. The main differences between terrestrial carnivores and pinnipeds are described below; specific differences between phocids and otariids are listed in Supplemental Table e2.",

The lungs and liver are lobated, with variation in the extent of lobation between species, and the kidneys are reniculate. The heart is broad and flat. Vascular adaptions, particularly pronounced in deep diving species, include an enlarged hepatic sinus, caudal vena cava, proximal aorta (aortic bulb) and spleen. The hepatic sinus in species, such as elephant seals is very expansive and should not be confused with an aneurysmal dilation. A muscular sphincter cranial to the hepatic sinus and the thick splenic muscular capsule and trabeculae enhance blood storage. Thermoregulatory adaptations include arterio-venous anastomoses in the skin and reproductive organs (Ponganis, 2008). The lungs have prominent fibrous interlobular septae, and smaller airways are reinforced by either cartilage (otariids), smooth muscle (phocids), or a combination of the two (odobenids) (Denison and Kooyman, 1973). The reniculate kidneys have a thick capsule and prominent outer cortical veins (Stewardson et al., 1999). Pinniped epidermis is thick with no arrector pili muscles, increased numbers of sebaceous glands, and a thick adipose rich hypodermis (Ling, 1970). Brown discoloration of teeth occurs with age. Walrus upper canines develop into large, ventrally directed tusks.",

            "text": "\nDomoic acid (DA) is an amino acid excitatory neurotoxin produced by diatom species, especially in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. DA has a high affinity for the \u03b1-amino-5-hydroxy-3-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainite subclasses of glutamate ionotropic receptors. Receptor binding of DA causes neuronal depolarization, endogenous glutamate release, and activation of voltage gated calcium channels resulting in cell dysfunction and death (Jeffery et al., 2004). Toxicity due to DA exposure was first identified in CSLs in 1998, following a bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia australis in central California (Scholin et al., 2000). Since then there has been an increasing incidence of DA-producing diatoms along the California coast and increased frequency of strandings of CSLs with neurologic signs and lesions associated with exposure to DA (Goldstein et al., 2008, Gulland et al., 2012). Though CSLs are by far the most common species affected by DA, toxicosis has also been diagnosed in harbor seals and northern fur seals (Lefebvre et al., 2010, McHuron et al., 2013). Neurologic abnormalities with acute DA toxicosis may be continuous and include ataxia, head weaving, abnormal scratching, seizures, and coma. Acute cases often strand in clusters temporally associated with blooms of toxin-producing diatoms (Scholin et al., 2000, Goldstein et al., 2008). Animals with chronic toxicosis have more intermittent seizures, unusual behavior, vomiting, and apparent blindness and they may be clinically normal between neurologic events. Chronic cases often strand individually and may not be temporally associated with specific blooms. Eosinophilia and low serum cortisol can be noted in CSLs with both acute and chronic toxicosis (Gulland et al., 2012). Sea lions with chronic DA toxicosis may have abnormalities detected on electroencephalogram and hippocampal atrophy can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging.",

            "text": "Brain lesions associated with DA exposure are centered on the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus and can be unilateral or bilateral; therefore, adequate histologic sections of both sides of the ventral mid-hippocampus are essential for diagnosis. In acute DA toxicosis there is acute neuronal necrosis affecting the granular cells of the dentate gyrus, pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and neurons in the amygdala and piriform lobe (Fig. 23.1\n). Within the hippocampus, pyramidal cells in cornu ammonis (CA) sectors CA1, CA3, and CA4 are affected often with apparent sparing of CA2 cells. Occasionally in animals dying very acutely following exposure, lesions are minimal with only rare neuronal necrosis or central hippocampal neuropil vacuolation. Neuropil vacuolation should be interpreted with caution as autolysis and specimen handling can cause artifactual vacuolation along the edges of the hippocampus. In chronic cases, grossly evident hippocampal atrophy may be seen unilaterally or bilaterally (Fig. 23.2\n). Histologically, there is parenchymal atrophy in the hippocampal formation, mild to severe loss of granular cells in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal neurons, astrocytosis, oligodendrogliosis, and mild lymphocytic perivascular cuffing (Figs. 23.3 and 23.4\n). Scattered acute neuronal necrosis may be noted. In severe acute and chronic cases there may be malacia in the adjacent piriform lobe associated with neuronal necrosis, loss, and gliosis. Occasional perivascular cuffing in the piriform lobe and scattered meningeal aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells can be seen in chronic disease (Goldstein et al., 2008, Silvangi et al., 2005). In more recent years, occasional cases have been noted with gliosis and neuronal necrosis in the amygdala and only relatively mild or no lesions in the hippocampus, though the cause of these lesions is unknown. Also, some CSLs with DA-associated hippocampal lesions may have multifocal lymphohistiocytic encephalitis, though whether this is due to a concurrent infectious process or to DA exposure has not been elucidated.",

Acute lesions include interstitial edema, rowing of cardiomyocyte nuclei, cardiomyocyte vacuolation, and, less frequently, necrosis. In subacute to chronic lesions, there is myocyte loss and replacement by adipocytes or loose fibrous connective tissue and areas can contain occasional macrophages with cytoplasmic lipofuscin (Fig. 23.5\n).

Domoic acid can be detected in feces, serum, urine, and gastric contents using tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatographic separation.

In harbor seals, the most common abnormalities identified are hernias, skeletal malformations, and proliferative conditions. In harbor seals there may be functional patency of the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus up to 6\u20137 weeks of age, therefore, these should not be considered congenital defects in very young pups without additional evidence of cardiac disease (Dennison et al., 2011). In elephant seals, hydrocephalus and cardiac abnormalities are most common. Low genetic diversity likely plays a role in the high prevalence of congenital defects noted in elephant seals (Trupkiewicz et al., 1997).",

Occasional cases of UGC have been diagnosed in captive CSLs, most of which were wild-born. Carcinogenesis is considered multifactorial with infectious agents, genetic factors, and high levels of organochlorine contaminants all possibly playing a role in tumor development. Otarine herpes virus-1 (OtHV-1), a gammaherpesvirus that is sexually transmitted, has been associated with UGC (Buckles et al., 2007).

The in situ lesions may be seen incidentally in CSLs that die from other causes without metastatic disease. As such, it is critically important to routinely perform gross and histologic examination of the entire reproductive tract of male and female CSLs to identify these tumors (Colegrove et al., 2009b, Gulland et al., 1996a). Histologically, intraepithelial lesions may be observed multifocally along cervical, vaginal, penile, or preputial epithelium and often large regions of epithelium may be affected. Penile or prostatic urethral epithelium is rarely affected. Intraepithelial lesions may extend into the uterus along the endometrial surface; however, this is thought to be a form of intraepithelial metastasis and not primary transformation of uterine epithelium. Affected genital epithelium is often markedly thickened with dysplastic cells and disordered maturation involving up to the entire thickness of the epithelium (Fig. 23.12\n). Increased numbers of mitotic figures can be seen. Direct infiltration of the underlying submucosa is difficult to identify, even in animals with widely metastatic disease. Multiple distinct morphologic patterns including squamous, cribiform, comedone, or basaloid can be observed in metastases. Neoplastic cells are polygonal with large nuclei and there is often a high mitotic rare with bizarre mitotic figures or multinucleated neoplastic cells (Fig. 23.13\n). Central necrosis within masses is common and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is adjacent to both intraepithelial lesions and surrounding metastases. Despite the association between UGC and OtHV-1, intranuclear inclusions are noted infrequently. When present, they are most common in genital intraepithelial lesions in which there is superficial ballooning degeneration (Fig. 23.14\n). Inclusions are extremely rare in metastatic masses.",

Histologically, there is marked epidermal and follicular hyperplasia with ballooning degeneration in the stratum spinosum. Moderately sized, round to chunky eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions are noted within epidermal and follicular keratinocytes (Fig. 23.19\n). There is variable epidermal necrosis and ulceration and often moderate associated mixed inflammation. Dermal fibrosis is occasionally noted (Nollens et al., 2006b). Lesions will often spontaneously regress. Sealpox is a zoonotic disease that causes nodular cutaneous lesions in people and transmission likely occurs when virus enters broken skin (Waltzek et al. 2012).",

Viral sequence analysis has determined that California sea lion adenovirus-1 (CSLAdV-1) is unique from canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1) and represents a new member of the genus Mastadenovirus (Goldstein et al. 2011). Stellar sea lions have antibodies to CAV-1 and canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2); however, canine adenoviral antibodies have not been detected in one infected CSL (Burek et al., 2005). Multifocal necrotizing hepatitis with hepatocellular intranuclear inclusions is the most common lesion reported in CSL infections (Fig. 23.20\n). In 1 case, endothelial infection was identified in the lung, lymph nodes, and eye in the absence of hepatic lesions. Ocular lesions included corneal edema, keratitis, and iridocyclitis. Several cases of necrotizing enteritis in CSLs have also been attributed to adenoviral infection; one CSL exhibited diarrhea prior to death (Fig. 23.21\n). CSLAdV1 has been amplified via PCR from liver and feces in affected individuals and adenoviral particles have been identified via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in several cases. The virus can also be amplified from feces of individuals without evidence of clinical disease, suggesting that some animals may be subclinical shedders of the virus.",

The infections were likely due to spread of a canine distemper virus (CDV) outbreak in terrestrial mammals (Grachev et al., 1989). In 1988, the first large-scale epizootic of phocine distemper virus (PDV) in harbor seals followed in European waters of the North and Baltic Seas causing 23,000 deaths, and in 2002 another outbreak occurred in the same region and affected 30,000 seals. Several stranding peaks in pinnipeds on the Atlantic coast of the United States have also been linked to PDV infections in harbor, harp, hooded, and gray seals but these have never caused significant die-offs as in European waters. Positive morbillivirus antibody titers are regularly found in Arctic seal species and provide evidence of widespread distribution of PDV in seal populations (Duignan et al., 2014, H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen et al., 2006).",

Clinical findings with PDV include oculonasal discharge, conjunctivitis, keratitis, coughing, dyspnea, diarrhea, abortion, head tremors, convulsions, and increased buoyancy. Pathological findings include bronchointerstitial pneumonia, pulmonary atelectasis, congestion, and edema as well as pulmonary, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, nonsuppurative encephalitis, and lymphocyte depletion in different lymphoid tissues (Fig. 23.22\n). Intracytoplasmic and intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies can be found in the respiratory epithelium, biliary and pancreatic ducts, renal pelvis, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal epithelium, neurons, and astrocytes (Duignan et al., 2014, Kennedy, 1998, Siebert et al., 2010). Due to viral-induced immunosuppression, PDV is often associated with secondary parasitic (pulmonary nematodiasis), bacterial (e.g., Bordetella bronchiseptica) and concurrent viral infections (Herpesvirus, Influenza virus). The diagnosis of CDV or PDV is accomplished by immunohistochemistry using cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies for the morbillivirus nucleoprotein and by the detection of morbillivirus-specific nucleic acid in tissues by RT-PCR. Antibody titers allow assessment of exposure and susceptibility to PDV (Duignan et al., 2014, Ludes-Wehrmeister et al., 2016).",

Isolates and serologic evidence of exposure is documented in multiple species and in both clinically affected and healthy individuals. An unusually wide variety of marine and terrestrial species including fish, birds, and other mammals may be infected, indicating that these viruses have an ability to infect many species of marine animals, some of which may act as reservoirs for others. Opal eye perch are a likely natural host. These viruses are indistinguishable from caliciviruses causing swine vesicular exanthema, and feeding swine uncooked garbage containing marine mammals and fish was a likely route of introduction into the swine population. Caliciviruses are zoonotic, with rare cases of human vesicular dermatitis and flu-like illness after laboratory and field exposures (Smith et al., 1998, Waltzek et al., 2012).",

Occasionally, necrosis of underlying digits can occur. Ulcerative stomatitis and ulcerative and nodular dermatitis of the lips, nasal planum, and chin have also been reported in CSLs. Abortion and premature birth in CSLs have been attributed to calicivirus based on positive viral isolation and serologic evidence of exposure, but causation has not been proven. Lesions begin as spongiosis of the stratum spinosum followed by subcorneal vesicle formation without formation of inclusion bodies (Moeller, 2003). The vesicles are very transient and ulcers with secondary bacterial infections are common. Diagnosis is by culture or RT-PCR (Moeller, 2003, Smith et al., 1998). Because of the importance in differentiating these viruses from foreign animal diseases, a real-time reverse transcription PCR has recently been developed that can identify most serotypes and differentiate them from reportable vesicular diseases (McClenahan et al., 2009).",

Sporadic infections and outbreaks have been reported in captive animals and exposure has been documented serologically in other geographic regions (Kik et al., 2006, Mackereth et al., 2005). Leptospira interrogens serovar\nPomona has been implicated in disease in CSLs. Based on the long-term serosurveys utilizing the microscopic agglutination test leptospirosis is thought to be enzootic in the CSL population. Periodic epizootics occur every 3\u20135 years and result in large numbers of CSLs stranding with clinical leptospirosis (Gulland et al., 1996b, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2007). An asymptomatic, chronic carrier state may provide a mechanism for persistence of the bacterium in the population (Prager et al., 2013). Though cases in free-ranging CSLs can occur throughout the year they are most commonly noted between July and December (Gulland et al., 1996b). Little is known about the epidemiology of leptospirosis in other pinniped species, where infections occur more sporadically or as small outbreaks in rehabilitation situations (Colegrove et al., 2005b). Leptospirosis may also cause abortion (Gulland et al., 1996b).",

Histologically, there is subacute to chronic lymphoplasmacytic tubulointerstitial nephritis, typically with a plasma cell heavy inflammatory infiltrate (Fig. 23.26\n). Leptospira-related liver lesions are not noted. In some phocids with infection, significant tubular necrosis is more severe than inflammation suggesting that the animals die in the more acute stage of infection. Infection can be confirmed histologically by demonstrating spirochetes with silver stains or IHC. IHC is particularly useful in animals with chronic infections or those treated with antibiotics since the spirochetes may be difficult to visualize; labeled antigen will be present in renal tubular epithelial cells and interstitial macrophages (Colegrove et al., 2005b, Gulland et al., 1996b).

Since then the disease has been reported in a number of captive otariid species worldwide, most frequently affecting Southern sea lions (Kriz et al., 2011). Infection in free ranging pinnipeds is confined to the southern hemisphere and transmission between species is thought to be by sub-Antarctic fur seals whose range overlaps with eight other otariid species (Bastida et al., 1999). To date, mycobacteriosis due to M. pinnipedii has not been reported for any phocid species; however, the potential host range is broad and transmission from infected fur seals and sea lions has been described for zoo species, domestic cattle, and humans (Cousins et al., 2003, Kiers et al., 2008, Loeffler et al., 2014, Moser et al., 2008, Thompson et al., 1993, Thorel et al., 1998).

            "text": "Pinnipeds with mycobacteriosis typically present in poor body condition. The majority of clinical infections involve the thoracic organs, supporting inhalation as the dominant route of infection, with two main gross presentations. The first involves granulomatous to pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia, thoracic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis with pronounced fibrinous or serosanguinous effusion (Fig. 23.27\n). In the second type of presentation, there are multifocal caseating granulomas within the lungs and thoracic lymph nodes. Several cases of respiratory mycobacteriosis have included concurrent granulomatous lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes, possibly reflecting spread into the abdominal cavity through swallowing infected respiratory secretions (de Amorim et al., 2014, Kriz et al., 2011). Meningeal, hepatic, and disseminated granulomas have also been reported (Forshaw and Phelps, 1991). Histologically, lesions are dominated by aggregates of epithelioid macrophages containing few to many intracytoplasmic acid-fast bacilli admixed with variable numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. Caseous necrosis of the centers of these granulomas is common; mineralization is generally minimal and multinucleated giant cells are rare. A presumptive diagnosis of mycobacteriosis can be made during post mortem examination based on the presence of acid-fast positive bacteria within granulomas. Confirmation of M. pinnipedii as the causative agent requires either culture and biochemical assays, which can be slow and laborious, or PCR. Population monitoring is best accomplished by necropsy of all dead pinnipeds and monitoring of live animals including lymph node cytology, thoracic radiographs, and bronchoalveolar lavage.",

            "text": "\nKlebsiella pneumoniae are Gram-negative bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family. They are ubiquitous in the environment and are common inhabitants of the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract of healthy mammals. Historically, most reports of K. pneumoniae in marine mammals were of sporadic respiratory infections or isolation from tissues of healthy individuals. However, in 2002 a mass mortality event caused by K. pneumoniae occurred in New Zealand sea lion pups in the sub-Antarctic (Castinel et al., 2007). The causal isolate was later identified as a hypermucoviscous phenotype (Roe et al., 2015), but appears not to be of human origin (Castinel et al., 2007). A similar isolate has also been reported in CSLs (Jang et al., 2010; Seguel et al., 2017a). The clinical presentation of hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae varies somewhat between host species. Affected New Zealand sea lion pups have bacteremia and fibrinosuppurative to histiocytic inflammation of the meninges, joints, lymph nodes, respiratory tract, peritoneum, and subcutaneous tissues (Fig. 23.28\n) (Roe et al., 2015). Disease has not been reported in juveniles or adults. Pleuritis, pyothorax, pneumonia, and abscesses are the most frequent lesions in CSLs and appear to occur in all ages (Jang et al., 2010; Seguel et al., 2017a), and septicemia and meningoencephalitis have recently been identified. Additionally, Spraker et al. (2007) describe a syndrome in CSLs on San Miguel Island, California, where K. pneumoniae bacteria are transferred into the abdominal cavity on the cuticle of hookworms that penetrate the intestinal tract, resulting in septic peritonitis. This has not been reported at other locations.",

The route of infection for marine mammals has not been elucidated but a fish or invertebrate vector is possible. Brucella-infected lungworms can be found in the lungs of pinnipeds though whether the parasites serve as a primary route of transmission or are incidentally infected is unknown (Garner et al., 1997).

            "text": "\nFungal dermatitis has been reported sporadically both in captive and free-ranging pinnipeds due to a wide variety of yeasts, non-dermatophylic hyaline molds, and dermatophytes. In addition to previously described predisposing factors, mechanical disruption of the skin and water quality issues (low salinity, high temperatures) can predispose to infection. Alopecia, acanthosis, and hyperkeratosis can be associated with Candida albicans, Fusarium spp. Microsporum sp. and Trichophyton sp. infections. Commonly affected areas include mucocutaneous junctions, nail beds, and the axillae (Pollock et al., 2000, Reidarson et al., 2018). In Stellar sea lions in Alaska, \u201cfungal patches\u201d due to Trichophyton sp. distributed across the body are very commonly seen and can be present for extended periods of time. Affected skin is thickened with a corrugated, often alopecic, appearance, sometimes in a target pattern with either healed or raw skin in the center (Fig. 23.30\n). Histologically, dermal skin infections cause chronic dermatitis, epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, folliculitis, and in cases of dermatophyte infection, there may be intrafollicular or superficial epithelial fungal hyphae. Special stains, such as PAS or silver stains can aid in identification and characterization of the organisms. Ulceration and suppurative dermatitis is generally related to self-trauma and secondary bacterial infection. Diagnosis can be made by skin scraping, fungal cultures, PCR; PCR is often needed to differentiate to species (Burek, 2001).",

L1 are coughed up, swallowed and shed in the feces. Parafilaroides spp. infect all age-classes at different intensities in different species, though infections are often more intense in younger animals. In uncomplicated infections there are small raised nodules along the pleural surface and in the parenchyma adjacent to bronchioles (Fig. 23.31\n). Parasites are fine and difficult to detect grossly; however, scraping the cut surface of lesions with a knife may enable visualization. Histologically, there are cross sections of small nematodes within alveolar spaces and bronchioles. Infection in most animals results in minimal lymphocytic interstitial and peribronchiolar inflammation and occasional granulomas may develop around degenerating parasites or larvae (Fig. 23.32\n). Heavy infections and secondary bacterial pneumonia can result in more significant inflammation, especially in young or debilitated animals. Mild bronchiole epithelial hyperplasia and lymphocytic tracheitis are also common (Measures, 2001).",

The primary hosts are ringed and harbor seals; infections have been reported in other phocids including gray, elephant, ribbon, and hooded seals (Measures, 2001, Measures, 2001). After ingestion, larvae migrate to the right ventricle, through the wall of the pulmonary artery and into the lungs. Significant infection generally occurs only in young animals. Heavy infections may impact diving performance, health and recruitment. Adult parasites reside in the bronchi and bronchioles (Fig. 23.33\n). The head of a worm is embedded in the parenchyma and the tail extends into the lumen. L1 larvae are released into airways. Infection induces variable amounts of mucus plugging of airways, mucosal cell hyperplasia, moderate lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic peribronchitis and mild chronic arteritis with tunica intima hyperplasia (Measures, 2001). In northern elephant seals reaction to larval parasites during migration in the pulmonary arteries can cause severe disease and death in the prepatent period. Clinical signs include harsh lung sounds, depression, neutrophilia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Grossly, nematodes are found in the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries; they are often associated with extensive hemorrhage in lung parenchyma. Histologically, nematodes are present within the vasculature and there is severe neutrophilic and lymphocytic arteritis, thrombosis, and interstitial pneumonia that can be complicated by secondary bacterial infection (Fig. 23.34\n) (Gulland et al., 1997a). The severe reaction in this species suggests a poorly adapted host (Measures 2001).",

            "text": "\nHookworm infections caused by members of the genus Uncinaria have been described in a number of otariid and phocid species. Both Northern and Southern fur seals experience significant pup mortality associated with infections. In a recent study, 94% of pups examined had infections and infections were identified as the cause of death in 35% of pups (Seguel et al., 2017b). While only two distinct hookworm species, U. lucasi and U. hamiltoni, have been confirmed to infect pinnipeds, recent studies suggest that there is considerably more species diversity than currently recognized (Nadler et al., 2013). The pinniped hookworm life cycle was largely characterized in northern fur seals in the 1960s and appears to be similar for other pinniped host species. Briefly, pups are infected via the transmammary route, with ingestion of L3 larvae in the milk when a pup first suckles. Larvae mature within the pup\u2019s intestine and eggs are shed in pup feces. Larvae develop in the environment and L3 larvae penetrate the skin of a susceptible pinniped host or are transmitted via ingestion. Larva then migrates from the intestines or subcutaneous tissues to the host ventral blubber where they lie dormant until, in pregnant females, they migrate into the milk during late pregnancy. Adult hookworms survive in the intestinal tract of infected pups from around 6 weeks (Lyons et al., 2011) to 8 months (Hernandez-Orts et al., 2013, Katz et al., 2012, Lyons et al., 2000) depending on host species. During this time, they attach to the small intestinal mucosa and feed on blood. Clinical signs are generally only seen in pups and are associated with blood loss into the intestine from parasite-induced damage. Severely affected pups have a reduced growth rate with severe fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis, anemia, and death. Typical gross lesions include pale tissues, nematodes admixed with hemorrhage in the small intestine, and numerous 2\u20134 mm diameter red foci on the serosal surface of the intestine that correspond to hemorrhagic and inflamed feeding sites (Fig. 23.35\n). Penetration of the wall of the intestine with subsequent peritonitis and bacteremia also occurs (Seguel et al., 2017b).",

Serologic evidence of exposure to T. gondii has been reported in a number of free-ranging and captive pinnipeds including artic and subartic seals and walrus with low exposure to felid definitive hosts. Parasite-associated disease is most commonly identified in free-ranging CSLs and monk and harbor seals (Miller, 2008). In CSLs with T. gondii infection, the most common lesions are necrotizing and lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and myositis with associated intralesional protozoa (Fig. 23.36\n). Neurologic signs including ataxia, seizures, and abnormal mentation have been observed with infection and concurrent DA toxicosis has been noted, illustrating the difficulty distinguishing protozoal disease from DA exposure on clinical signs alone. Infection has also been identified in aborted CSL pups, confirming vertical transmission of the parasite. Incidental tissue cysts can be occasionally seen within skeletal or cardiac myocytes (Carlson-Bremer et al., 2015). In harbor seals, widespread meningoencephalitis is the most common lesion of toxoplasmosis and coinfection with Sarcocystis neurona have been identified in a number of seals. In one investigation in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, T. gondii infections were most commonly caused by Type I genotypes (Gibson et al., 2011). In Hawaiian monk seals, infection is typically disseminated and very large numbers of organisms are associated with lesions. Adipose tissue is often severely affected (Barbieri et al., 2016).",

Several cases have also been identified in captive animals (Lapointe et al., 1998). Harbor seals are the most commonly reported species to develop severe fatal disease with infection, and in California subadults and adults are primarily affected (Barbosa et al., 2015, Miller, 2008). Lesions include nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis which is often most severe in the cerebellum and can be associated with numerous organisms (Lapointe et al. 1998) (Fig. 23.37\n). Rosette-form schizonts with occasionally visible residual bodies can be used to differentiate organisms from T. gondii. Barbosa et al.

Though infection in CSLs causes only mild enteritis, one of these novel coccidian species was linked to fatal infection in a neonatal harbor seal, suggesting CSLs may be a definitive host for a protozoan pathogenic to other species (Colegrove et al., 2011). Enteric coccidia have also been noted in elephant seals and South American fur seals.
