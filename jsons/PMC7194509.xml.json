Even though patients with diabetes and hypertension frequently use ACEIs and ARBs, many confounders must be accounted for when interpreting findings of observational studies.5 In another study looking at risk factors for mortality among patients with COVID-19,6 despite hypertension and diabetes being identified as the most frequently associated comorbidities, after multivariate regression the association between these disorders and COVID-19 mortality was no longer significant.",

In children and young adults, ACE2 receptors are present at a much higher density in lung tissue than in older individuals. Thus, the condition in people taking ACEIs and ARBs emulates that in young people. It is possible that having more ACE2 receptors provides a reserve against target-mediated destruction by SARS-CoV-2.7 ACE2 functions to produce the heptapeptide angiotensin (1-7), which has favourable effects on the pulmonary endothelium and might provide resilience from development of pulmonary failure in COVID-19.7\n",
