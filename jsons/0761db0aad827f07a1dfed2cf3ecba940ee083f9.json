With the surge in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerabilities to the continuity of our healthcare system is apparent. Importantly, availability of these resources varies between states and geographical areas and, as such, some areas may be more heavily impacted than others. 12 COVID-19 and other viral infections can cause significant damage to the lungs and airways potentially resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and, if severe enough, respiratory failure 13 . There are certain patient demographics that appear to be associated with a higher susceptibility to developing severe respiratory complications from COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation [2] [3] [4] [5] 14 . These conditions included obesity, older age and smoking as well as cardiometabolic and lung disease [2] [3] [4] [5] . Patients with these characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions are also at higher risk for serious complications from seasonal influenza 13, 15, 16 . Of note, obesity was present in nearly one third of hospitalizations and fatal cases during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 13 . However, not all patients sharing these characteristics experience similar outcomes during this pandemic or even became infected. There are also people who do not possess these characteristic who require mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admissions due to the COVID-19 pandemic [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .

However, mechanical ventilation has been shown to induce rapid atrophy and profound weakness of the respiratory musculature [41] [42] [43] . Adverse changes in the respiratory muscles due to mechanical ventilation have been defined as Ventilator Induced Diaphragm Dysfunction (VIDD) and may occur after only 18hrs of mechanical ventilation [41] [42] [43] . These effects of VIDD makes it difficult for patients to successfully wean from mechanical ventilation by creating an imbalance between respiratory muscle force generating capabilities and the demand imposed for spontaneous breathing 19, 21, 22, 44, 45 . Lower diaphragm thickness even at the outset of mechanical ventilation is associated with delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation and a higher risk of complications 46 . Unsuccessful weaning from mechanical ventilation due to VIDD may be exacerbated in patients with baseline respiratory muscle performance impairments as many are also risk factors for failing to wean 17, 18, 20, 22, 23 . This relationship is especially concerning in obese patients 17, 18, 20 . Obesity has been shown to increase the length of stay and need for mechanical ventilation even due to influenza infection 16 , and results in poorer outcomes 15 .",

The threshold for respiratory muscle weakness in a younger healthy adult is also fairly low (i.e., >40years of age: 63cmH 2 O) 25 . However, respiratory muscle weakness is associated with dyspnea 28 , and there are certain populations where respiratory muscle weakness is more likely 17, 48, 49 . Even in healthy older individuals, the maximal inspiratory pressure produced by the respiratory musculature decreases 24 . However, due to the normal age-related changes in lung compliance and muscle strength the threshold for respiratory muscle weakness with aging is also lower ( i.e., >80 years: 42cmH 2 O) 25 . It is important to acknowledge that these age-related reductions are in reference to healthy individuals. As described earlier, in patients with multimorbidity, the risk of respiratory muscle weakness may increase or potentially compound these age related reductions in respiratory muscle performance 35, 38 . While routinely screened measures of lung volume and flow rate are associated with respiratory muscle performance 36, 37 , changes in respiratory muscle performance may occur independently of these values and may be detected prior to changes in lung volume 36, 37, 49, 50 .",

Those in poor health and at risk for viral infection (e.g., influenza) may demonstrate respiratory muscle weakness and thus be at increased risk of a poorer clinical trajectory if acute respiratory distress syndrome ensues. However, even in healthy individuals without dyspnea, respiratory muscle training has also been shown to provide modest benefits on exercise performance 62 .

As described in this concept paper, it appears diminished respiratory muscle performance, in conjunction with other disconcerting characteristics (e.g., obesity, chronic diseases), may contribute to the overwhelming burden imposed on healthcare systems due to viral pandemics. What is more concerning is that frequency of viral pandemics, and the prevalence of the global population at poor health associated with impaired respiratory muscle performance are potentially both at the tipping point. In nations with high economic development, poor baseline health is now, unfortunately, the norm; obesity alone is present in now 42.4% of the adult population in the United States and continues to increase 81 . Another troubling trend is the presence of multimorbidity in older adults 82 , a population that also continues to increase 83 .",

Furthermore, in patients identified as having respiratory muscle impairments, respiratory muscle training may prove valuable in mitigating the health impact of future pandemics. plotted over time the peak work capacity is much lower than patient B (A: 346 PTU vs, B: 614 PTU). This demonstrates the additional information regarding respiratory muscle performance that can be gleaned from the TIRE compared to assessing maximal inspiratory pressure alone.",

Currently, no studies have directly investigated the role of respiratory muscle training to reduce the risk of respiratory failure due to viral infection.

Mans et al demonstrated that preoperative respiratory muscle training may reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications following cardiothoracic or abdominal surgery by half 70 .
