Ingestion of these can induce a range of clinical symptoms including staggers, and cattle are the most commonly affected species. Although it has been mentioned since the early part of the 20 th century, there are no published descriptions of paspalum staggers in horses. The foals presented with ataxia in all limbs after consuming infected paspalum. One foal died from misadventure and the other two recovered within 1 week of removal from the infected paddock. In the second case, two of eight mares and geldings grazing in an irrigation channel developed hindquarter paresis. After removal of all horses from the area, one of the affected horses continued to deteriorate and had to be euthanased.",

Several parasites and potentially pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the fish, but despite a detailed laboratory investigation the cause of the mortality event could not be determined. A second smaller episode of deaths occurred later, with fish dying in a sea-cage that had been stocked several weeks earlier. Similar pathogens, including parasitic infections, were again isolated but again a single causative agent could not be identified as the cause.

            "text": "The article in the August issue of the journal of the surgical management of a case of colic in a filly makes for interesting reading. 1 It would appear that it took three surgeries over a period of 2 days to manage this condition. Three surgeries to manage a case of equine colic? This is not an isolated instance. Today, when reading journal articles of equine laparotomies it is common to encounter re-laparotomies. The authors of the above article noted that \"repeat laparotomy\" is a risk factor for the development of ventral abdominal wound dehiscence.I began performing laparotomies for surgical colic cases in the 1970s. In those days colic surgery was performed as a last resort and conducted without aggressive IV fluid therapy. My success ratethe number of cases discharged from the hospital after surgeryranged from 20% to 25%. This was the result achieved from one laparotomy; if the condition could not be resolved after one surgery there was no question of performing a second operation. This meant that surgery was seldom recommended because of the poor prognosis and high cost.In 1980 I travelled to the USA and spoke with a number of equine surgeons there and the 20-25% success for this type of surgery was consistently described. A number of surgeons were of the opinion that the poor success rate mitigated against the procedure and recommended humane euthanasia as the better option. Some older surgeons had stopped performing such surgery. Today, with improved techniques, including going to surgery much earlier and the use of fluid therapy, new equipment and suture material, the success rate has improved -but not by that much! Even with repeat laparotomies a success rate of 50% still leaves a lot to be desired and makes the ethics of such surgery questionable.If this is the case why is such surgery so readily undertaken? Is it performed because of client demand or because of the willingness of the surgeon to go to surgery, once, twice or more times or is it for the welfare of the patient?Is it because horse owners are now prepared to pay for the high cost of such surgeries? Comprehensive insurance policies may allow this type of surgery to be undertaken more frequently.Is it because the surgery can be done and is available? It would be a brave surgeon -or a foolish one -who did not advise the client that the prognosis for such surgery is guarded.But what about the welfare of the horse? Is this surgery in the best interest of the patient? If the veterinary profession is to take ethics seriously, shouldn't this be the first consideration?In the same issue of the journal there was an opinion piece entitled \"Ethical dilemma -Sheba. \" Perhaps a debate, as opposed to an opinion piece, regarding the ethics of the performance of laparotomies and re-laparotomies in the horse for the management of colic should be considered.",
