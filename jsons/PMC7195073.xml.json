The viruses, and attendant measures to check its spread, have led to many countries reporting increased mortality and morbidity rates, whilst facing huge economic losses, social disruption, physical distancing, and additionally the potential for a widespread increase in mental health issues (Dong and Bouey, 2020; Ho et al., 2020; Torales et al., 2020a).",

            "text": "Pandemic, as a form of disaster, is a complex and unpredictable situation leaving limited opportunities to conduct well planned, organized and controlled clinical trials (Benight and McFarlane, 2007). Most of the published studies we found were cross-sectional in nature, phase-specific (i.e. either first phase of disaster or post-disaster phase) and limited to certain populations (e.g. health care workers)(Brooks et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Makwana, 2019; Math et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2020a), which has limited value to develop comprehensive strategies to address the mental health issues during pandemic. This could be due to the current theoretical framework or recommendation to address the mental health needs of the affected population (Math et al., 2015; Ornell et al., 2020; Purgato et al., 2018). The Young\u2018s theoretical framework is one of the commonly used for disaster research. It includes heroic, honeymoon, disillusionment and restoration phase of disaster with preventive, curative and preparedness as a treatment strategies (Math et al., 2015; Math et al., 2008). However, it is not disaster-specific (e.g. earthquake, terrorist attack, infectious disease), so may have limited value in the current pandemic. In addition, most national and international recommendations for mental health care during disasters are vertical in nature. These recommendations or frameworks do not consider the use of recently available digital technology and global plan for mental health (Math et al., 2015). There is a need to reconsider the current theoretical frameworks and provide alternative approaches to conduct future disaster research projects(Benight and McFarlane, 2007; Dong and Bouey, 2020); however limited attempts have been made to provide new or alternative framework at global and national disaster preparedness.",

The fear and distress experienced by one person may be unconsciously mirrored by others, thus leading to a spread of these emotions throughout society. In our deeply interconnected and digitalized world, these emotions may spread far more easily, as dire news from one corner of the world can influence people in another distant country by a myriad of news outlets, social media networks, videos and chat rooms(Gao et al., 2020). As a consequence of this, we may expect first peak of EEC in the community. There may also be an increase in the rate of relapse and recurrence of mental disorders in those already living with mental illness(Torales et al., 2020b). Furthermore, the stigma against mental health disorders, and inadequate mental health-related infrastructure, serve as additional barriers for those who are distressed to obtain help. This conceptual model is well supported by the existing literature(Ho et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b; Lima et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Neria et al., 2008). The time interval between the two peaks will be dependent on country specific measures and mitigation efforts. We note however, that in this model, we have not considered the appearance of the second wave of COVID-19 infections. In the event of this second wave, a second wave of EEC may have a more heterogeneous mixture of cases. It is thus imperative that this emotional contagion is prepared for by stakeholders at both national and international levels.",

However, most HCW are inadequately trained in the intervention. In addition, WHO-PFA does not address the primary mental health needs of the people under quarantine, those facing COVID-19 related social stigma, and those affected by national mitigation measures (social distancing, lockdowns, etc.). Furthermore, WHO-PFA provides little attention to managing myths and fake news, the impact of the virtual world on pandemic-related distress and the effects of the epidemic curve on mental health. Thus, it does not address the first peak of the EEC nor the second. It may also have poor face- and content-validity, all of which limits its use in practice. As such, we suggest the following modifications in the WHO-PFA (Ref. Box 1\n) to address core mental health issues.
