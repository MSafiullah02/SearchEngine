            "text": "In the last ten years I have attempted to provide another view concerning virus\u2013host evolution. I have argued that viruses often attain evolutionary stability by species-specific persistence and that such states apply to all domains of life, including prokaryotes. On an evolutionary time-scale, the majority of viral lineages tend to exist as species-specific persistent (aka temperate, latent, and chronic) infections in which individual hosts will be colonized by mostly silent (asymptomatic) viruses for the duration of their life (Villarreal et al., 2000). Such persistence can have major consequences to the evolution of both virus and host, which also leads us to more directly link virus evolution to broader issues of host evolution. It is from this perspective that we start to clearly see that viruses indeed belong on the tree of life as major participants (Villarreal, 2005, 2006). Persisting viruses are not simply agents responsible for destruction of life, but are also agents that create genetic novelty on a vast scale that influences all life and promotes symbiosis (Marquez et al., 2007; Ryan, 2007; Villarreal, 2007). The persistent lifestyle of such symbiotic virus\u2013host relationships is not simply a less efficient, acute infection; nor is it simply a \u201creservoir\u201d for acute virus (as epidemiologists are prone to assert). Neither can it be attributable to concepts of selfish DNA. Persistence represents a major virus life strategy that is both fundamental and highly adapted. It has distinct genetic, fitness, and evolutionary characteristics that require intimate, host (tissue)-specific viral strategies and precise gene functions to attain stable maintenance in the presence of immunity and to allow biologically controlled reactivation. Persistence also must resist displacement by similar viruses and competitors. It is virus\u2013host persistence that provides the thread that allows us to link these polyphyletic viral lineages (and their clouds) with the entire tree of life. In turn, this link identifies a much more fundamental role for viruses in the evolution of host, visible from the very earliest to the most recent events in host evolution. It is from such species-specific persistent states that the large majority of acute diseases evolve and emerge by various mechanisms.",

            "text": "Another recent and major development in virus evolution is the arrival of various proposals suggesting that viruses have been involved in some major innovation and transition in the evolution of life. In all these proposals, however, it is necessary that the virus in question has attained a stable genomic persistence with its host. These evolutionary events thus seem to be the products of viral-mediated symbiogenesis of host (Ryan, 2007; Villarreal, 2007). Proposals include the possibility that viruses may have originated the DNA replication system of all three cellular domains (archaea, bacteria, eukarya) of life (Forterre, 1999, Forterre (2005), Forterre (2006a), Forterre (2006b); Filee et al., 2003; Forterre et al., 2007). The discovery and analysis of the largest DNA virus (1200 ORF mimivirus), a lytic cytoplasmic virus of amebae (a distant relative of phycodnavirus and poxviruses), has also led to proposals that this virus lineage may represent an ancient fourth domain of life (Raoult et al., 2004; Desjardins et al., 2005; Claverie et al., 2006). It is interesting that in an initial structural analysis, the large complex replication centers for mimivirus were confused with the host nucleus (Suzan-Monti et al., 2007). Thus, it seems relevant that others have proposed that a distant relative of phycodnaviruses and poxviruses may have originated the eukaryotic nucleus (Villarreal, 1999; Villarreal and DeFilippis, 2000; Bell, 2001, 2006; Takemura, 2001).",

A virosphere clearly exists but its nature and boundaries are not so clear. Multiple viral origins, their diversity and numerical dominance in distinct and sometimes harsh environments as well as their presence in host genomes suggest that any viral tree of life will be huge, multidimensional, and connected to the host tree of life. As discussed below regarding double-stranded (ds)DNA viruses of prokaryotes, they have all the above characteristics. Such viruses may represent the big bang of biological novelty. With their unmatched capacity to generate diversity they can function as the mass creators of biological novelty as well as destroyers of most species. Surely, such capacity must have had big influences on the evolution of life.",

The core concepts of evolutionary biology were developed well before we had a modern understanding and definition of viruses (Luria, 1950). After all, the basic lysogenic model of phage integration was only clarified in 1962 when developed by Campbell (see Campbell, 2007). That cryptic and defective phage are ubiquitous in the genomes of all prokaryotes is generally considered uninteresting by many in the field of evolutionary biology. I suggest that the seemingly applicable concepts of selfish DNA effectively derailed any thinking that persisting genetic parasites might have a more germinal role in the evolution of life (Doolittle and Sapienza, 1980; Orgel and Crick, 1980). Yet as outlined above, virus footprints in major evolutionary transitions are clear and a direct role in such events now seems much more plausible. We therefore must seek to defining the nature of the virosphere and how its evolution relates to the tree of life.",

RNA in vitro reduces genotype\u2013phenotype issues to RNA secondary structure and minimal free energy states. This allows both continuity and discontinuity to be measured. These same issues are crucial for the study of RNA viruses, whose sites of secondary structure often define replicator identity. These models currently offer the best system to evaluate an early and simple biological world for evolutionary principles (see Chapter 3). Viruses and viroids with their RNA genomes may be the only extant survivors of this pre-DNA world. Since it was the consideration of error-prone replication that led to the development of the concept of quasispecies (see Chapter 2), such models have provided a conceptual foundation which led to several basic concepts. Chapter 4 discussed the foundations and various aspects of quasispecies theory. Viruses appear to operate close to the error threshold, thus allowing maximum evolutionary exploration (Biebricher and Eigen, 2006). However, as presented below, the loss of the \u201cfittest\u201d type concept has also led to clear experimental evaluations of consortia-based evolutionary behaviors.

One involved cooperative evolution that results from ligated genomes.

The issue of consortia will come up often. Consortia selection directly implies cooperation, but cooperation of selfish replicators presents dilemmas. Replicator networks with interaction functions that give highly non-linear dynamics can result in complex mixtures, with behaviors ranging from survival of the fittest to also including attainment of globally stable equilibrium tantamount to permanent coexistence. The fitness of populations, however, is inherent to current quasispecies concepts in virology. There may also be other ways to explain the genetic origin of cooperation (such as stable persistence involving addiction strategies). The stable persistence of a genetic parasite can compel cooperation and promote the conservation of information (see below).",

HIV infection of humans shows evidence of this in that the R5 virus is more fit for transmission and early disease whereas the X4 virus is fit later during the AIDS disease phase. Clearly conditional, time-dependent issues relate to fitness definitions. However, much more problematic is that we have no theory for viral persistence or its fitness. We lack specific or measurable parameters other than the simple maintenance of genetic material. Yet it seems clear that some distinguishing features of persistence can already be recognized. For example, the possible participation of viral defectives (normally considered unfit), which in numerous circumstances can modify or mediate persistence, would need to be included. Clearly, a defective role in persistence would also preclude them from being considered as genetic \u201cjunk,\u201d or selfish elements, since they would then matter in measurable ways to the biological outcome of virus persistent infection.",

We should refrain from thinking of viruses simply as fit or non-fit individual types since they clearly exist in populations that provide population-based adaptability.",

Yet population selection is no longer a contestable issue in RNA virus evolution (see below). I expect that many classical evolutionary biologists might interpret this as evidence that viruses really are an oddity in this feature and are not representative of broader processes of evolutionary biology. Furthermore, viral-based group selection may not be limited to quasispecies-based evolution.

We can start to attain a global perspective and appreciation for their ability to assemble genetic function from enormous, complex mixtures of genomes, and select gene sets needed to solve multivariant, temporally dynamic evolutionary problems. We can then seek evidence for the role of viral elements in fundamental host innovation and be open to evaluating the occurrence of viral entities from a constructive perspective and not instinctively dismiss such observations as due to coincidence, \u201cjunk,\u201d or selfish DNA.",

The \u201clive\u201d oral Sabin vaccine can be considered to have been a miracle of the practical approach to virology developed in the 1950s (Horaud, 1993) in that it was used well before our understanding of the relevant evolutionary theory. The Sabin vaccine strain was the result of rodent-adapted virus and differs from the neurovirulent Mahoney strain by 56 point mutations (in the consensus sequence), although only a small number of these mutations were needed for neurovirulence (Christodoulou et al., 1990). One of the important neurovirulent mutations was within the RNA polymerase gene (Tardy-Panit et al., 1993). However, the significance of this observation took many years to unravel and exploit. In time it became apparent that 3Dpol mutants could affect replication fidelity. One poliovirus point mutant, 3DG64S, was shown to have enhanced high-fidelity replication and that selective pressure could be designed to increase fidelity in RNA polymerase (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005).",

Although 3DG64S replicates well in culture (with lowered error rate), it was less pathogenic in this mouse model and competed poorly with 3D wild-type virus. It seemed that the decreased viral diversity was less able to generate the variation needed to get past bottlenecks due to multiple selective differences presented in vivo in tissues in the host, such as brain infection (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2006).

This has provided insight into the likely action of ribavarin on product fidelity (Harki et al., 2002).

Such control of fidelity allowed for the design of control experiments in which the same consensus virus genome could be forced to generate either less or more diverse progeny populations.

Also, as mentioned above, group selection is a process that will not readily be accepted as representative by the broader community. Is there any evidence that this result with poliovirus indeed represents a general virus\u2013host evolutionary relationship in natural settings? As presented in Chapters 13\u201315Chapter 13Chapter 14Chapter 15, retroviruses and also human hepatitis virus C clearly exist as quasispecies populations that affect disease outcome. In the case of the retroviruses, viral populations show diversity that far exceeds that seen for other RNA viruses. In both HIV-1 and HCV there is clear circumstantial evidence for the importance of quasispecies for in vivo disease outcome, drug resistance, and fitness. In addition, with HCV, CNS infection may sometimes result, and such brain infections appear to be mediated by distinct quasispecies (Forton et al., 2004; Forton et al., 2006), reminiscent of the poliovirus mouse model.",

Measurements of HIV quasispecies in individual patients indicates that multiple evolutionary patterns can be found in typical individual patients (Casado et al., 2001), thus mixtures of HIV exist in patients (Bello et al., 2004, 2005).

Unlike poliovirus and most RNA viruses, retroviruses (e.g. non-lentivirus) have colonized the genomes of animal species in large numbers and represent a large fraction of these genomes. Genomic retroviruses are present in vast numbers, most of which are defective and mutant copies. In this genomic colonization they resemble the dsDNA viruses of prokaryotes (discussed below) that also colonize all prokaryotes although at a much lower numbers. The human genome has fewer than 26 000 genes, but appears to have 500 000 retroviral-related LTR elements. Some of these elements are intact and conserved (human ERVs (HERVs)) and this genomic population has some clear characteristics of a viral quasispecies. Such large amounts of genetic material have previously been dismissed simply as selfish or junk DNA of no fitness consequences to the host. However, given the importance of quasispecies mutant genomes for viral fitness and persistence, we might need to re-evaluate this dismissal. Retroviruses are clearly part of the human ancestry thus we should seek to understand, not dismiss their role in human evolution.",

These are also positive single-stranded polycistronic RNA viruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). This group of virus includes the coronaviruses (e.g. mouse hepatitis virus and SARS-associated coronavirus), which are the largest RNA viruses known (26\u201332 kb). It has been proposed that such large genomes have required the adaptation of a high-fidelity RNA polymerase in order to increase the error threshold and accommodate large RNA genomes. Based on the phylogenetics of this polymerase and other RNA-processing enzymes, this group of viruses appears to be monophyletic and it is thought that the acquisition of a high-fidelity RNA replicase was central to the origin of this lineage. This type of replicase is unique to RNA viruses. The monophyletic view stems from an analysis of a small set of conserved genes. Overall, however, these larger genomes have many other genes that show no similarities to related viruses. The origins and evolution of these more diverse and numerous genes cannot be currently traced.",

If most of RNA virus evolution is indeed mediated by a mixed cloud of genomes, any role for mutant mixtures thus becomes obscure. But perhaps there is little else we can currently do given the lack of information. How might we explain the increased fidelity and genome size of the nidoviruses? Was there some change in viral adaptation in which quasispecies and generation of mixtures was no longer as important for adaptation? Did the need and selection for a larger genome override the use of error to generate adaptability as seen in poliovirus and HIV-1? If so, what selective pressures might have changed this seemingly basic feature? What do we know about the natural biology of these viruses, which might provide some insight into this?",

These studies also indicate that there appear to be three different and independent groups of SARS viruses in bats. In fact six novel coronaviruses were isolated from six different bat species showing an astonishing diversity in bats. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicates that all bat coronaviruses appear to have descended from a common ancestor. Only one of these bat groups includes SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses that adapted to acute human infections. Thus, a prevalent and species-specific persistence of SARS viruses is found in particular geographical populations. Why is this relationship stable? Could the adaptation to a host-specific persistence-based basal life strategy provide some explanations for the evolution of the higher fidelity RNA replicase of these coronaviruses? As I have argued, persistent viral infection represents the majority of evolutionary stable viral lineages (Villarreal, 2006). However, we have almost no knowledge regarding how these bat SARS viruses persist and escape elimination by innate and adaptive immunity and what, if any, role the high-fidelity replicase (or other genes) have in this life strategy.",

I propose that these stable evolutionary states of viral persistence are due to a strategy we can call virus addiction (Villarreal, 2005) and that MHV can provide the exemplar of such a state. With MHV, only persistently infected mice colonies are protected from the disease that is otherwise caused by the virus. In wild asymptomatic mice, MHV is found mostly as an enteric infection. The CNS demyelinated disease that MHV can induce is most observed in newborn pups (Homberger, 1997; Nash et al., 2001) and once in the brain, MHV can persist in CNS with recurring disease (Marten et al., 2001). This recurring CNS disease is also associated with quasispecies (in the S gene) and recombination (Rowe et al., 1998). The most serious CNS disease is in S-gene variant of MHV-4 (JHM), thus as with the polio\u2013mouse model, pathogenic fitness with MHV is also associated with quasispecies.",

To establish stable asymptomatic persistence, however, MHV needs to infect newborns (Weir et al., 1987), in which acute disease is prevented due to maternal passive immune antibody transfer (Gustafsson et al., 1996). Being born to immune mothers thus protects against CNS disease and promotes enteric (not brain) virus colonization. In addition, it appears that persistence also promotes cross-species transfer (Baric et al., 1999).",

The colony that is persistently infected with MHV will have a distinct advantage over its neighbor as MHV introduced into this uninfected colony will have severe effects on the offspring. Eventually, we can expect only the MHV-harboring colony will prevail in both hay stacks. This is a state I have called virus addiction.

One population of LTNPs was reported to have been colonized by an HIV variant that showed low virus replication and slow or arrested evolution (Bello et al., 2005). In another case, a stable non-progressor was colonized by a replication incompetent version of HIV-1 (Wang et al., 2003).

Due to its history and potential for initiating great human epidemics, it has long held the special interest of evolutionary virologists (see Chapter 5; Nelson and Holmes, 2007). However, this research has not much emphasized the quasispecies character of influenza virus evolution. Instead, it concentrates on the evolution of the master template or clades of template for the purposes of vaccine development (Webster and Govorkova, 2006). The views stemming from this type of evolution have lent themselves well to master template-based phylogenetic analysis and have dominated how many researchers think of virus\u2013host evolution. Thus it is curious, given the above emphasis, that the quasispecies character of influenza populations often seems of low relevance to issues of acute disease and vaccination, other then to provide a source of diversity. In some situations, viral competitive interference may contribute to drift variation and displacement in antigenic epitopes (Levin et al., 2004). Yet outcomes of individual human and bird infections do not seem much affected by specific quasispecies structures, as we saw with HIV-1 and HCV.",

            "text": "With influenza, we are mainly concerned with epidemic human disease. However, by shear numbers of infections and deaths worldwide, it must be admitted that influenza virus is really a virus that affects mostly birds. For example, during the 2005 outbreak in China, only 251 humans died whereas 230 million domestic birds died (Smith et al., 2006). Although our concern on the large potential for human disease is understandable, these numbers should inform us of a more basic virus\u2013host biology. In this case, influenza shows a high affinity for various birds; migratory water birds in particular can have high prevalence (Wallensten et al., 2006). Some waterfowl, such as wild mallard ducks, have been called the stealth (asymptomatic) carriers of influenza H5N1 and free grazing ducks seem to introduce virus into domestic bird populations (Gilbert et al., 2006). Thus waterfowl represent the well-accepted epidemiological concept of a reservoir species (Louz et al., 2005). But these wild waterfowl, shorebirds, and gulls that are a natural host for avian influenza also seem to show a much slower rate of evolution (Spackman et al., 2005). In contrast, the much higher rate of evolution as seen in chickens and turkeys indicates that these hosts should not be considered as natural reservoirs (Suarez, 2000). In waterfowl, influenza infections show several distinctions, such as virus co-infection or virus interference (Sharp et al., 1997) as well as phylogenetically distinguishable waterfowl dendograms, including specific M lineages (Makarova et al., 1998; Widjaja et al., 2004). The diverse and stable avian pool of influenza virus appears to be ancestral to the influenza viruses that infected human populations.",

Influenza A, for example can be seen to show extended periods of stasis followed by periods of rapid adaptation that necessitates adaptations in vaccine strategy (Wolf et al., 2006). However, the evolutionary variation between seemingly similar viruses can be surprisingly large (see above VSV section). For example, the very different phylogenetic behaviors between influenza A and measles virus, both acute human respiratory infections due to membrane-bound negative-stranded RNA viruses, are striking. The reasons for the maintained genetic stability of measles virus remain poorly understood, but may well involve more complex fitness associated with systemic infections.",

It would seem that such conclusions go against the concept of quasispecies as being fit per se as described above. In this consideration we see a major weakness of extant phylogenetic methods. They were not developed to access the evolutionary relationship and fitness of interacting mixtures. Nor were they designed to follow the evolution of systems with high rates of recombination between numerous parental templates. We currently lack the analytical tools for such a population analysis. Without such tools, however, it seems we can only evaluate those parameters we can define and will remain confused by those we cannot.

However, the rampant recombination and quasispecies generation of HIV-1 makes a quantitative assessment of the virus population problematic. One proposed solution is to use a composition vector method (Gao and Qi, 2007).

The main realization is that DNA phage are the numerically dominant genetic entity in most habitats on Earth (mentioned above). In addition, as discussed in Chapter 10, it is now clear that some of these viruses are surprisingly complex and that essentially the entire pool of dsDNA viruses of prokaryotes may be exchanging DNA via recombination at high rates. This would constitute by far the largest common gene pool on Earth. Historically, the evolution of the DNA viruses of prokaryotes has seldom been considered in the broader context of virus evolution or evolutionary biology. Although it has long been realized that there are many basic similarities between viruses of bacteria and eukaryotes (Luria et al., 1959), not until structural studies solved the capsid genes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses did the evolutionary relationships between these viruses become clear. In addition, there have been a number of striking proposals that suggest that DNA viruses of prokaryotes may be involved in the origin of several major systems used by cells and that viruses appear to be involved in several major transitions during host evolution. Thus we now consider the possibility that these DNA phage were fundamental to the origin and evolution of life on Earth.",

However, phyogenetic analysis of common or conserved genes of LUCA identifies only about 325 or fewer genes in extant cellular genomes (Mushegian, 1999; Koonin et al., 2001; Mirkin et al., 2003). Ironically, the genes needed for DNA replication are not part of this conserved set, calling into question the nature of the first DNA-based cell. Large-scale \u201chorizontal\u201d transfer seems to have clearly prevailed early in the evolution of DNA-based cellular life and it has recently been asserted that LUCA existed in a highly horizontal \u201cconsortia\u201d of cooperative genes that developed the common genetic code (Vetsigian et al., 2006).",

Thus the evolution of early life would have clear similarity to the quasispecies (consortia) state of genetic information as seen in RNA viruses above.

Yet even with T4-like viruses, there can be clear barriers to horizontal gene transfer which promote the evolution of stable viral lineages (Filee et al., 2006a). In T4-type phage, 24 similar core genes could be seen in all genomes, which seem to be inherited in gene blocks that preclude recombination. However, these blocks were not seen in the broader T-even and pseudo T-even genomes. Other phage also show surprising genetic stability when repeatedly isolated from similar habitats, such as soil phages of Burkholderia (Summer et al., 2006) and Bam35 (Saren et al., 2005) as well as some hot spring isolates (Khayat et al., 2005). This Bam35 capsid also identifies another structural motif mentioned above that is broadly conserved in evolution and shows clear similarity to that capsids found in PRD1 and PBCV-1 (discussed below). SH1 also has a clear PRD1-related capsid, membrane, and genome; thus this halophilic euryarchaeon virus, although showing no sequence similarity to PRD1 or any other bacterial phage, is clearly structurally related (Bamford et al., 2005a).",

We now know, however, that persisting (temperate) phage are also common, some of which have no independent lytic phase. The fundamental model of phage persistence by unique integration into host chromosomes (temperate lysogeny) marks a major development in our understanding of molecular virology and virus\u2013host relationships which was first clarified by Campbell in 1962 (see Campbell, 2007). All free-living prokaryotes show the presence of colonized phage in their genomes. Both complete and defective genomes of dsDNA viruses have been observed in the sequenced DNA of all free living prokaryotic genomes (Gelfand and Koonin, 1997) (exceptions are some intracellular parasites and plastids). Thus, the massive genetic diversity and novelty of phage evolution as presented above has a direct conduit into the genetic composition of all prokaryotes via lysogeny.",

Fitness of temperate phage, however, is more complicated then that of a lytic virus and, like fitness of persistence discussed above, cannot be simply described by relative replication or efficient virion production. Here too, successful phage colonization must inherently limit the replication of the same virus. Thus, a temperate lifestyle also requires an autoinhibitory capacity. This generally involves an immunity gene set that not only limits self-replication but can also affect replication of other temperate and lytic viruses, i.e. lambda (even as a defective) precludes T4 and other T-even phage. Uncolonized hosts are thus susceptible to lysis by highly prevalent acute tailed phage. Host fitness is thus strongly affected by a temperate phage due to its ability to preclude and survive other competing phage. I suggest this situation is similar to the MHV\u2013mouse exemplar above, in that virus-colonized hosts are in a state of \u201cvirus addiction\u201d in which persistence is needed to provide protection from the same or similar virus (Villarreal, 2005, 2006).",

In this relationship, we see another example of group selection operating on bacterial populations harboring a persistent virus. Thus, what host is fit depends very much on the prevalent viruses it will encounter as well as the viruses that colonize it.

One such silent and common phage that has long been studied is P1. P1 was initially discovered due to its effect on T4 and lambda. However, P1 has been a very interesting model, not because it causes disease or offers potential therapy against bacterial pathogens, but simply because it persists efficiently as an episome and competes effectively with many other phage (Yarmolinsky, 2004).

P1 encodes several gene pairs (toxins/antitoxins, such as the PhD/DOC pair) that protect bacteria harboring P1, but kill daughter bacteria that have lost the P1 genome (Gazit and Sauer, 1999). This strategy compels colonized E. coli to maintain P1 or die (DOC, death on curing). However, these very same addiction systems are also involved in protecting a P1-colonized colony from T4 and lambda infection and will also induce self-destruction when cells are infected by those viruses, protecting the colony (population). P1 also provides an exquisite level of molecular self-identification in that it will recognize a single second copy of its own genome (Yarmolinsky, 2000).",

Parvovirus evolution (see Chapter 17) can show a sharp contrast to the evolutionary pattern displayed by other small dsDNA viruses above (HPV, Py). With the emergence of an acute pandemic in domestic dogs and cats (as well as other wild carnivore species), we see what is essentially evolution driven by single point mutations, mostly affecting the capsid genes and host cell receptor binding. This system provides us with one of the better studied examples of the evolutionary dynamics of an emergent viral disease. In addition, in vivo mouse studies with minute virus of mouse (MVM) now make it clear that parvoviruses can behave much like RNA viruses, generating quasispecies of diverse progeny that allow a high adaptability for the generation of fitness and disease in vivo (Lopez-Bueno et al., 2006). This story is very reminiscent of the study of poliovirus in mice mentioned above.

These large, complex dsDNA membrane-containing icosahedral viruses are abundant in some water habitats (Van Etten, 2003; Ghedin and Claverie, 2005). The reason they deserve special attention is that they clearly have many features that are characteristic of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. They resemble prokaryotic viruses in that their life cycle is clearly phage-like, such as external virion attachment, injection of DNA and no pinocytosis. In addition, they also encode many phage-like genes, such as restriction-modification enzymes and homing endonucleases (Filee et al., 2006c). They also resemble eukaryotic viruses in that they have eukaryotic DNA replication proteins (DNA polymerase beta and PCNA; Chen and Suttle, 1996; Nagasaki et al., 2005; Villarreal and DeFilippis, 2000) as well as many genes associated with eukaryotic signal transduction (Van Etten et al., 2002). Thus they represent a clear link between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses. For example, the DNA polymerase of paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (PBCV-1) is the most conserved gene and most closely resembles that found in human herpesvirus and is distantly related to the similar family DNA pol encoded by T4. This polymerase is distinct from that of the poxviruses or PRD1/adenoviruses (associated with protein-primed DNA replication). However, numerous other genes of the phycodnaviruses are similar to some genes found in the mimiviruses (giant DNA virus of ameba), including the presence of conserved intenes in the DNA pol gene (Ogata et al., 2005).",

Oceanic phycodnaviruses are thought to have large influence on the free-living populations of eukaryotic algae, such as the termination of algal blooms reported for Emilian Huxley virus (Martinez et al., 2007; Schroeder et al., 2003). However, not all phycodnaviruses are lytic. Another lineage of phycodnaviruses is represented by two viruses of filamentous brown algae, EsV-1 and FirrV-1 (Delaroque et al., 2003). Unlike the lytic phycodnaviruses noted above, these two viruses are \u201ctemperate phage\u201d like. That is they exist as silent viruses whose DNA is integrated into the germlines of their host. In this, they are unique to all known eukaryotic DNA viruses; host chromosome integration is a normal part of their persistent life strategy. EsV-1 has a 335593-bp genome and encodes 231 likely genes (Delaroque et al., 2001). These genes are mostly unique and only 28 are clearly related to PBCV-1 genes. The gene differences include many replication genes and their gene order is completely different. Like the temperate phage\u2013host evolutionary relationship outlined above, it would be most interesting to understand how the integration of these large DNA viruses has affected host evolution.",

Similarly, the cytokines-like genes (such as IL-10) as found in poxviruses and herpesviruses appear to have originated in at least three independent events prior to the divergence of mammalian eutherian orders.

In this analysis, only a few genes of recent origin could be identified as possibly having been transferred between virus and host (e.g. new genes found at tips of phylogenetic dendograms). Thus, gene gain in the herpesviruses (as in DNA phage and phycodnavirus) is prevalent but the origination of such genes from the host is not prevalent.

Similar replication mechanisms are seen in all poxviruses, as well as African swine fever virus and phycodnaviruses (PBCV-1). This exact replication strategy is also present in archaeal lipothrixviruses (SIRV1 and SIRV2) which has been proposed to be ancestral to phycodnaviruses and poxviruses (Persson et al., 2005).

The similarity between poxvirus and PBCV-1 DNA replication deserves some additional comment. PBVC-1 and herpesvirus have very similar DNA polymerase genes, yet differ fundamentally in replication strategy. Furthermore, the poxviral DNA polymerase gene is very different from that found in the herpesviruses. Yet, the PBCV-1 capsid was clearly similar to that of adenoviruses and PRD1 phage (and iridovirus capsids). How then do we link poxvirus evolution to other more ancient DNA viruses, such as PBCV-1 which has the same DNA replication mechanism, but distinct replication proteins? Such observations might seem confusing, but they are clearly consistent with mosaic, reticulated evolution of DNA viruses. Various distinct phage lineages can link in multiple ways to various distinct eukaryotic DNA viruses. The concept of a net or matrix rather than a tree is thus a better way to describe the broad topology of DNA virus evolution.",

Typically, we seek to understand poxviruses evolution from the perspective of pathogenesis, such as the origin of human-specific smallpox virus. With the comparative genomics of several orthopoxviruses now possible, we see curious overall patterns of gene loss in their evolution (Randall et al., 2004). For example, comparing human smallpox to cowpox DNA (a rodent virus that is phylogenetically basal to smallpox), we observe an overall diminution of gene content in smallpox virus. Several poxviruses seem to have also lost genes relative to cowpoxvirus, especially genes that appear to affect immunity (Hughes and Friedman, 2005). I suggest that this evolutionary tendency for gene reduction is associated with a switch from a more demanding species-specific persistent life strategy to a less demanding, acute life strategy in a new host. Cowpox is a naturally persistent infection in rodents (bank voles) (Feore et al., 1997; Chantrey et al., 1999), which has been called a natural virus reservoir (Hazel et al., 2000). Smallpox is a strictly acute and human-specific disease. Such gene loss in association with lost persistence could be a general situation and might also explain why clinical isolates of human cytomegalovirus isolates show a strong tendency to delete genes with passage in culture (Davison et al., 2003).",

The enotomopoxviruses are particularly prevalent in grasshopper and locust species, often in unapparent states. Interestingly, within these viruses we can find examples of major shifts in core replication genes, such as the family of DNA pol gene that is used (a shift from DNA pol X to DNA pol B in two entomopoxvirus lineages). We can recall that the DNA pol B gene closely resembles that found in phycodnaviruses (and herpesvirus), but is distinct from that in orthopoxvirus (Zhu, 2003). We also see in the entomopoxviruses some clear links to phage genes, such as T4-like RNA ligase found in all entomopoxviruses (Ho and Shuman, 2002) as well as a lambdalike integrase seen in D1EPV (Hashimoto and Lawrence, 2005).

E. chlorotica eats photosynthetic eukaryotic algae (Vaucheria litorea) and retains the functional chloroplast from algae for months. Here too, however, there lies a viral footprint. This slug harbors an unusual endogenous retrovirus which is expressed in large numbers during sexual reproduction, following which all slugs die via synchronized apoptosis and in which the chloroplasts have accumulated numerous viral particles (Pierce et al., 1999; Mondy and Pierce, 2003). Since there is reason to think gene movement from the algae to the slug genome is involved in this symbiosis, the presence of this retrovirus is a strong candidate to also be involved in symbiogenesis.",

The specific ERV involved is simply selfish and mostly defective genetic material of no general consequence. If so, why is it that in sheep a distinctly different lineage of retrovirus (enJSRV) was also selected to provide a related placental function to a another mammal with significantly different placental reproductive biology? It has been experimentally well established the enJSRV env is essential for sheep embryo implantation (Dunlap et al., 2006a, 2006b). enJSRV is the endogenous version of JSRV, a problematic sheep-specific retrovirus that induces lung tumors (responsible for the death of Dolly, the famous first cloned sheep). The endogenous virus (enJSRV) is present in 20 copies in the sheep genome and all sheep have this virus. Sheep genomes also encoded a trans-dominant enJRSV gag that is inhibitory to exogenous JSRV (Mura et al., 2004; Oliveira et al., 2006; Murcia et al., 2007). It seems clear that this situation can also be considered from the perspective of viral symbiosis and/or virus addiction in host evolution. We should thus seek to understand why colonization by an ERV population might generally provide a good solution to the evolutionary demands of placental biology.",

But these events mostly occurred in our extinct ancestors and we do not see ongoing evidence that any HERVs remain active. However, we are currently witnessing a related virus\u2013host evolutionary event of considerable interest. Koala bears, native marsupials of Australia, are currently experiencing a major epidemic caused by a leukemia-inducing retrovirus. As a consequence, they are undergoing massive endogenization by a gammaretrovirus (MLV-related). This virus is similar to Gibbon ape leukemia virus, but most likely originated from rodent ancestry (Tarlinton et al., 2006; Fiebig et al., 2006). The expectation is that extinction awaits those koalas that do not adapt or endogenize the retrovirus successfully (Stoye, 2006). This event has the appearances of a retroviral-driven addiction that will result in a genetic variant of koala bear that has acquired a new antiretroviral state. This seems equivalent to the expansion of human APOBEC3; or perhaps a closer analogy is the endogenization of a suppressive gag as occurred with enJSRV. The surviving koala bears will likely tolerate or be persistently infected with this retrovirus pool. The genome of the species will have undergone considerable (but unpredictable) genetic perturbations and likely contain a large pool of variant and defective retrovirus. However, in so doing, the descendent koalas will likely present a biological hazard to any koala species that remain virus-free (as in virus addiction). Currently, one island colony of koalas is sufficiently isolated to have remained virus-free. This population will henceforth be under persistent threat from populations of endogenized koalas, now favored by group selection.",
