EMCV, a potential omnipresent zoonotic agent, has a broad host range with rodents as its natural reservoir [2]. As yet, there has been no report of EMCV isolation from bats; however, Miniopterus fuliginosus is supposed to be one of the natural hosts of EMCV due to the detection of a genome fragment of the virus in the bat\u2019s fecal guano [3]. JEV is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus with humans as the definitive hosts and pigs as the amplification hosts [4]. JEV have been isolated from multiple species of fruits and insectivorous bats in several Asian countries [5]. Experimental infection of JEV in some insectivorous and fruit bats showed persistent viremia and viral replication in multiple organs without pathological symptoms or signs of encephalitis [6].",

Previous studies have showed that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 signaling is critical for IFN-\u03b2 production and susceptibility of cells against EMCV and JEV infection in humans and mice [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Only a few studies are available on PRRs and type I IFN signaling in bats during viral infection. Activation of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 after poly(I:C) stimulation have been described in P. alecto kidney cell line, Desmodus rotundus fetal lung cell line, and E. fuscus kidney cell line; however, their role in stimulating type I IFN production has been clarified only in the E. fuscus kidney cell line [[17], [18], [19]]. Here, the influence of EMCV and JEV on PRRs\u2013IFN\u2013\u03b2 signaling in bat cell lines derived from four bat species (Pteropus dasymallus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Miniopterus fuliginosus) was examined.",

The high basal expression level of PRRs (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) has been observed in several bat species, including R. leschenaultii, Rhinolophus affinis, and Desmodus rotundus [19,27,28]. This high basal expression level of PRRs in the above three species of bats enables quick elimination of EMCV and JEV through stimulation of type I IFN production. Conversely, the FBKT1 cells derived from P. dasymallus showed a low basal expression of PRRs. This is consistent with previous study wherein the expression level of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in P. alecto kidney was very low compared to that in other tissues; however, the kidneys of R. leschenaultii and R. affinis had an expression level of TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 comparable to other tissues [18,[28], [29], [30]].

Inability of FBKT1 and HEK293T cells to limit EMCV replication might be due to their inability to increase the expression of PRRs and IFN-\u03b2 as high as that in DEMKT1 and BKT1 cells (Fig. 2B, C, 2D, and 2E). Similar to other flaviviruses, JEV also can antagonizes type I IFN production to evade antiviral immunity and benefit viral replication through suppression of RIG-I and MDA5 to inhibit type I IFN production [31,32]. The suppression of RIG-I and TLR3 observed in FBKT1 after JEV infection should have caused limited increase in IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 2B, C, and 2E). In contrast, JEV failed to suppress the PRRs in BKT1, DEMKT1, and YUBFKT1 cells.",

Increased replication level of EMCV and JEV after knockdown of PRRs indicates that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 are responsible for suppressing EMCV and JEV replication in BKT1 cells through IFN-\u03b2 production. IFN-\u03b2 is predominantly induced by TLR3 after EMCV infection but comparable IFN-\u03b2 expression level was shown in all cells knocked down for PRRs after JEV infection. In a previous study, knockdown of PRRs in E. fuscus kidney cells also showed that IFN-\u03b2 is predominantly induced by TLR3 than RIG-I and MDA5 after poly(I:C) transfection [17]. Even though the TLR3 knockdown cells had the lowest IFN-\u03b2 expression level, knockdown of TLR3 did not result in the highest EMCV replication level. Knockdown of MDA5 resulted in the highest EMCV and JEV replication level among all cells knocked down for PRRs (Fig. 4A and 4B). Previous studies have showed that MDA5 is the dominant mediator of type I IFN and cytokine response during EMCV infection in mice because of RIG I degradation by EMCV 3C protease [12,16]. MDA5 seemed to have a greater role in stimulating antiviral pathway in Rhinolophus bat cells because it was highly up-regulated as compared to other PRRs after EMCV infection of BKT1 cells and was the only up-regulated PRRs after JEV infection (Fig. 3B, C, and 3D). It is possible that MDA5 stimulates antiviral pathways other than IFN-\u03b2 during EMCV and JEV infection of BKT1 cells.",
