Infants with CGISCs are cared for in intensive care units and do not receive breastmilk in the first few days of life. They undergo invasive procedures and do not receive adequate skin-to-skin contact with their mothers. They get exposed to gastric acid suppressants, parenteral nutrition and multiple courses of antibiotics. All these factors have the potential to increase the risk of gut dysbiosis. [1] [2] [3] While the gut microbiota of extremely preterm non-surgical infants has been well studied using culture-independent genomic approaches, 4 there is very limited information on gut microbiota of term infants with CGISCs. The studies that evaluated gut flora in neonates with surgical conditions in the past were based on the conventional culture-dependent techniques. 5 However, a growing body of evidence in the recent decade has shown the importance of culture-independent, genomic approaches in understanding the role of the human microbiota in health and disease. 6 Hence, we conducted this prospective study to investigate the gut microbiota in term neonates with CGISCs using culture-independent techniques.",

SCFAs have important biological functions in humans, such as immune modulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic and antimicrobial effects and enhancement of gut integrity. 7 They are thought to play a key role in microbiota-gut-brain crosstalk. 8 In infants, SCFAs are the by-products of fermentation of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) by the anaerobic bacteria in the colon. HMOs are not digested by the small intestine of infants and hence they reach the colon intact, where they are utilized as nutrition by bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. Since not all bacteria have the necessary enzymes to utilize HMOs, these milk glycans facilitate the establishment of a highly specialized microbial ecosystem dominated by Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides among others, while indirectly limiting growth of other bacteria. 9 It is possible that neonates with CGISCs have insufficient amounts of anaerobes such as Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides, which in turn could result in decreased utilization of HMOs, and hence lower amounts of SCFAs in the colon. Given the importance of SCFAs in human health and the interplay between gut microbiota and SCFAs, 7 we investigated stool SCFA levels in these infants.",

Controls were healthy term newborn infants (\u226536 weeks). We chose to include infants born at 36 weeks also instead of the conventional definition of 37 weeks because many infants with surgical conditions are born at 36 weeks and would not have been eligible for inclusion, thereby resulting in difficulty in achieving the sample size. Preterm infants <36 weeks were excluded to avoid the confounding effect of prematurity, which itself is a significant risk factor for gut dysbiosis.

Parents were advised to do thorough hand washing before collecting the samples and to screw the lid tightly immediately after collection to prevent contamination. Accredited couriers retrieved the samples from infants' homes in cooler bags with ice packs within 48 h of collection by parents. Subsequently, all stool samples were initially stored at \u221220\u00b0C for 3-5 days and subsequently at \u221280\u00b0C.

Purified PCR products were submitted to the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (UNSW, Sydney, Australia) for library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform using the MiSeq Kit v3 (2 \u00d7 300 cycles). rRNA sequence analysis 16S rRNA sequence data were initially quality filtered and trimmed using TRIMMOMATIC VERSION 0.36 truncating reads if the quality was found to be below 12 in a sliding window of 4 bp. Reads shorter than 100 bp were discarded after quality trimming. USEARCH version 11.0.667 was used to merge forward and reverse reads between 350 and 550 nucleotides. Primer sequences were truncated with cutadapt version 2.5. 11 Reads with no detectable primers were removed from the further analysis. Afterwards, reads were quality filtered using USEARCH. All reads with an expected error of more than 2 and more than 1 ambiguous base were removed. All sequences of all samples were concatenated in a single file and subsequently dereplicated to form unique sequences. Unique sequences were clustered into zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs, also called ASVs) using the UNOISE3 algorithm implemented in USEARCH. Chimeras were removed de novo during clustering and in reference mode using the UCHIME2 algorithm together with the SILVA SSURef NR99 v132. Processed, concatenated sequences were mapped on the final set of zOTUs to determine their occurrence and abundance in each sample using the otu_tab command with an identity cut-off of 97% and termination options disabled, which means that every sequence is searched against every zOTU to find the best hit.

Samples were vortexed for about 10 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,817 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C to solidify the precipitate. After that, 0.5 mL of aqueous supernatant was transferred into a new tube; 4-methyl valeric acid was added as internal standard (IS) to a final concentration of 500 \u03bcM. Then, 250 \u03bcL of ethyl acetate was added to extract SCFAs with a vortex for about 30 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,817 \u00d7 g; lastly, 50 \u03bcL volume of organic extracts were transferred into GC glass vial for GC-MS analysis. One microliter of organic extracts was injected into GC-MS system (Agilent Technologies 7890B-5977B) equipped with a HP-FFAP capillary column (30 m \u00d7 0.250 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm; Agilent). Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 mL/min. Split ratio is 30:1. The oven temperature was initially held for 1 min at 80\u00b0C, then increased to 120\u00b0C at 20\u00b0C/min, and finally to 210\u00b0C at 6.13\u00b0C/min and held for 2 min The temperature of the injector, ion source, quadrupole, and interface were 250, 230, 150, and 280\u00b0C respectively. The SCFA data analyses were performed in duplicate. Identification of the SCFAs was based on the retention time of standard compounds and with the assistance of the NIST 17 library. Quantifications were carried out in selected ion monitoring acquisition mode in MassHunter Acquisition software with base peak ion selected as quantifier for each compound. The calibration graphs were constructed in MassHunter Quantitative software (version B.09.00) by plotting the relative response (ratio of peak area SCFAs/peak area IS) vs. relative concentration for each individual SCFAs. The final SCFA concentrations were expressed as microgram per gram wet weight faecal sample. Since the data were not of normal distribution, Wilcoxon's rank analysis was performed to compare SCFA concentrations between the two groups (CGISCs and HIs).",

Bifidobacterium was the predominant genus during the second week in HIs because they were predominantly breastfed and at home compared to CGISCs, who were still in hospital and had issues, such as feed intolerance, parenteral nutrition and intravenous antibiotics, all of which would have interfered with colonization by Bifidobacteria. 18, 19 Normally, HMOs are utilized by Bifidobacteria, which enables them to grow and enrich the gut. 18 In the absence of adequate intake of breastmilk, there can be delay in the gut colonization by Bifidobacteria. In our study, the median age at the collection of second sample was 13 days, whereas the median age at full feeds was 15.5 days in infants with CGISCs.

SCFAs are volatile fatty acids produced by the gut microbiota in the large bowel as fermentation products from food components that are unabsorbed/undigested in the small intestine. 27 Acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid are the most abundant, representing 90-95% of the SCFAs present in the colon. SCFAs result in reduction in the luminal pH in the gut, which inhibits pathogenic microorganisms. 28 Acetate produced by Bifidobacteria and other commensals improves intestinal defence mediated by epithelial cells and thereby protects the host against lethal infections by enteropathogens. Butyrate is an important fuel of intestinal epithelial cells and stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway in intestinal cells, which is positively correlated with gut defences. 29 Butyrate also enhances the intestinal barrier by regulating the assembly of tight junctions. In addition, SCFAs are known to have anti-inflammatory properties. 7 Bacteroides are known to increase the intestinal concentrations of acetate as well as propionate, 30 whereas Firmicutes are predominant contributors of butyrate. While Bifidobacteria are not butyrogenic by themselves, acetate and other organic acids Gut microbiota in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical. . .
