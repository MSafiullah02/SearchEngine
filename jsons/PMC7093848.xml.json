Aerosols were formed using the Mini-Clean device (Castellini SpA, Bologna, Italy) with air pressure set to 6 to 7 atmospheres and water flow to 1 atm. We placed the aerosol distributor at a distance of 1 centimeter from a smooth porcelain surface that simulated the patient's mouth. We used a mannequin head to simulate the dentist's face and placed it at a distance of 40 cm from the porcelain surface. The mannequin's oral cavity was covered with latex and had one entry (mouth) and one exit (throat), connected to a 250-milliliter collection flask containing 50 mL of distilled water by a polytetrafluoroethylene tube 30 cm long and 1 cm in diameter that terminated well below the surface of the water. A vacuum pump (Cattani SpA, Parma, Italy) attached to the flask provided two possible airflow rates through the tube of 0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m3/hour to simulate human breathing at rest and during exercise, respectively. We adjusted the airflow rates using the lock nut attached to the pump and calibrated by a flow meter. Using scanning electron microscopy, we found that the bicarbonate dust (Airflow Prophylaxis Powder, Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland) was composed of particles of monosodium hydrogen carbonate (5\u2013300 \u03bcm in diameter), silica particles (< 1 \u03bcm in diameter) and other (probably organic) particles of variable dimensions (10\u201320 \u03bcm in diameter).",

We performed four sets of experiments with each of the three masks and in the absence of any mask (control): at the two airflow rates, each with and without vaporization of bicarbonate dust (0.5 m3/hour and 9 m3/hour). We conducted all sets of experiments in triplicate, with each individual run lasting 30 minutes. The room and equipment were cleaned thoroughly between each run. In sets of experiments involving vaporization, we activated the particulate for only the first 10 minutes of the run. We carefully fitted a new mask for each separate run in the position in which it is commonly worn. At the end of each run, we extracted 25 mL of solution from the collection flask and placed it in a beaker that had been cleaned with distilled water, dried and placed in a stove at 100 C for two days, and had then been weighed with a precision (10-microgram) balance (AT 261 \u0394 Range AD, Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland) and kept in a dryer until use. After addition of the solution, we placed each beaker in a stove at a temperature of approximately 60 C until complete evaporation was achieved, and then kept it at 100 C for another day before weighing it. We calculated the amount of residual dry sediment as the difference between the baseline weight and the final weight of each beaker.",

To confirm the validity of the experimental setup, we compared the weight gains recorded with and without vaporization of bicarbonate powder in the absence of any mask (control conditions): significant differences (P < .05 with the Wilcoxon test) in weight gain were found at both airflow rates. To determine whether any measurable amount of particulate is deposited from the masks themselves during use, we compared the weight gains recorded for each mask in the absence of vaporization with the corresponding control data (no mask); the Wilcoxon test showed no significant difference between any of the masks in comparison with controls at either airflow rate. Furthermore, in the absence of vaporization, we found no difference (Kruskal-Wallis test) among the three types of masks in terms of weight gain. By contrast, we found significant differences among the three masks in the presence of vaporization of bicarbonate dust (P < .03 with the Kruskal-Wallis test at both flow rates), with the lowest amount of residual dry sediment being recorded for the 1862 respirator. Furthermore, the weight of residual dry sediment recorded with each of the three masks always was significantly lower than that found without any mask (always P < .05 using Wilcoxon test, at both flow rates). Taken together, these data indicate that all three masks provide significant filtering abilities, with the 1862 respirator performing best. For both flow rates, we calculated the efficiency of each mask in terms of the percentage weight of particulate filtered with respect to control experiments (without masks), using the following formula:",

The relevance of such studies is highlighted by current concerns regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the present simulation study, we compared a personal particulate respirator (certified in accordance with European Committee on Standardization standard EN 149:2001) with two conventional surgical masks commonly used by dentists.
