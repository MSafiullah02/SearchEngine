This has necessitated increased communication with patients\u2019 primary providers who are not rostered for inpatient care through encrypted group texts, emails, and telephone calls. Moreover, the situation has also required significant task shifting within the team, such as nurses and physicians instituting behavioral contracts, which has been traditionally conducted by psychologists. Psychology support has been prioritized for the outpatient settings to provide continuity of care for their existing patients and thus maintain low readmission rates to minimize our hospital bed utilization. Therefore, routine psychology support for inpatient services has been reduced. Group meal supervision, in a designated room, has also been reverted to individual meal supervision by nurses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, only one parent/caregiver has been allowed to visit the patient and this visitor has been required to undergo screening (temperature, travel, contact history with COVID-19 patient or flu-like symptoms) at the hospital\u2019s screening booths before entry.",

For our psychology service, more urgent cases have been prioritized to receive ongoing service provision.

For our patients with underlying anxiety, especially those with health anxieties and contamination fears that are commonly seen in eating disorders, we have found that the situation regarding COVID-19 has fueled a worsening of their health-related fears and phobias[11]. While the provision of evidence-based information about COVID-19 on mainstream media and social media plays an important role in managing \u201ccoronaphobia\u201d, more research is urgently needed to understand the psychosocial fall-out from COVID-19 and evidence-based approaches to manage these issues[12,13].",

To ensure continued learning, we have provided increased didactic teaching to the residents in a small group setting. For those residents who have been re-assigned to the separate teams caring for patients at risk of COVID- 19 infection, we have included them in teaching through use of web-based conferencing. We have also curated journal articles on eating disorders for trainees for their self-reading and also encourage our residents to do case-based discussions with faculty on the eating disorder cases that they have seen to consolidate their learning. We have also instituted an adapted adolescent medicine self-reflection learning tool that residents complete with our faculty[16].",

In Singapore, the public and government have been widely supportive of health care workers and our institution has increased mental wellness support including the establishment of help lines for emotional support. In addition, as many patients have required increased mental health support, it is important that staff are also engaging in self-care. On a multidisciplinary team, we have found open conversation and flexibility to be critical as various specialties have different experiences with infectious disease risk and infection control protocols.",

We need to constantly evaluate changing needs of our patients and their families in this rapidly evolving situation. A strong foundation in interprofessional education and collaboration empowers team members to adapt and sustain quality care to all our patients despite the challenges in a time of crisis[17].
