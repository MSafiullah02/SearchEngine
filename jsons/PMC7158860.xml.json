Physical examination revealed hypothermia, mild bradycardia, labored breathing, pale mucous membranes, and petechial hemorrhages on the pinnae. There were numerous neurologic abnormalities, as well. Neurologic examination revealed nonambulatory tetraparesis with a stuporous mentation, responsive only to noxious stimuli. Spinal reflexes were normal, and cranial nerve exam revealed a negative menace response in both eyes, reduced oculocephalic reflexes in both eyes, and a reduced response to facial and nasal sensation on the right side. Postural reactions were not attempted, and pain was not elicited on palpation of the head or spine. Neuroanatomic localization was multifocal or diffuse intracranial disease, and differential diagnoses included infectious meningoencephalidities, metabolic encephalopathies, and, less likely, a vascular encephalopathy.",

T2\u2010weighted sagittal images were also obtained (TR 4000, TE 119.0, 3.0 mm).

Multifocal ill\u2010defined, small regions of hyperintensity were identified on T2W images, primarily in the gray matter at the following locations: both piriform lobes, the caudate nucleus bilaterally, the region of the caudal aspect of the right hippocampus, the ventromedial aspect of the frontal lobe bilaterally, and ventral to the rostral aspect of the lateral ventricles bilaterally (Figs. 1C, 2A, C). These regions were hyperintense on FLAIR and iso\u2010 to slightly hypointense on T1W images (Figs. 1D, 2B, D). No abnormal regions of intravenous contrast enhancement were identified. Hyperintensity was noted in the region of the left olfactory bulb on T2W images; this was hyperintense on FLAIR images. This region was hypointense on T1W images pre\u2010 and postintravenous contrast (Figs. 1A, B, 3A, B). No regions of signal void were identified on GE images. No abnormalities were identified in the portion of the cervical spine included on the sagittal images.

In several areas, the occluded vessels surrounded or lay adjacent to variably sized circumscribed foci of malacia (infarct), hemorrhage, and white matter degeneration (Fig. 4A). Many vessels also contained fibrin thrombi (Fig. 4B). Proliferating intraluminal cells had plump, irregularly round to oval vesicular nuclei with coarsely clumped or stippled and marginated chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli and had modest amounts of poorly defined eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclear and cellular atypia and mitotic figures were not observed. Immunohistochemically, the cells stained strongly positive multifocally for Factor VIII and/or muscle specific actin (MSA) suggesting an endothelial cell or pericyte histogenesis, respectively (Fig. 4C, D).1 Vascular lesions similar to those described in the brain were also observed in the heart (severe), spinal cord, spleen, adrenal, pancreas, extraocular muscles, stomach, small intestine, colon, bone marrow, kidney (rarely), and liver (rarely). Additionally, there was moderate erythroid hyperplasia of bone marrow. Sections of brain, heart, and spleen were negative for Bartonella spp by PCR test (Galaxy Diagnostics, Morrisville, NC).

Administration of intravenous contrast yielded mild enhancement of these lesions as well as identification of an additional lesion in the claustrum.8 Noncontrast enhanced MR images of the 7\u2010year\u2010old Siamese with intravascular lymphoma revealed asymmetry in the cerebral cortices with hyperintensities in the right cerebral cortex on T2 and proton density images, as well as thickened/poorly defined gyri in that location.6 These intravascular lymphoma patients differ from the patient in this report in that this patient did not have enhancing lesions, did not have cerebral asymmetry, and was ultimately not diagnosed with lymphoma.",

Thoracic radiographs and abdominal sonographic findings were relatively unremarkable aside from the slightly thickened small bowel with a prominent muscularis layer.
