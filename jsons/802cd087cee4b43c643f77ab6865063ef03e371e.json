MMF is used widely in feed additives and human medicinal applications throughout the world; however, there have only been a few reports about the biostudy of its fermentation mechanism and medicinal ingredients. To safely use MMF, we observed the changes in the ingredients and amylase activity for several raw materials during the fermentation process of MMF. We are going to explore the basis of pharmacodynamic substances and the purpose of MMF to provide support for safe use in clinics. This biostudy data demonstrated that the ingredients such as amygdalin, benzaldehyde, and rutin were gradually degraded during the process of fermentation, and the fermented MMF did not contain amygdalin and benzaldehyde. The HPLC fingerprint of fermented MMF for 7 days is similar to the chemical composition of the original unfermented MMF with a similarity of only 0.106. Meanwhile, the activities of amylase in fermented MMF had gradually increased, and the content of organic acids also had increased. According to our biostudy, we found that the raw material chemical composition of MMF in the process of fermentation was affected by microorganisms and various substances. The conclusions of our study determined that the initial components of MMF are not identical to the pharmacodynamic components. We also conclude that amylase activity explains the pharmacological activity of MMF to a certain extent, but it is likely not the only factor. The implication not only provides the initial knowledge of MMF but also implies the further exploration of this popular traditional medicine.",

During the fermentation process of the foods or drugs, the influence of microorganisms is an important step in the production; for example, senna glycoside is degraded into diarrhea-causing emodin under the influence of microorganisms in our human bacterial gut system. 3 For use as a purgative drug, the activity of microbial degradation of Scutellariae Radix is higher than that of the root. 4 Since the beginning of the third century, it has been wellknown that MMF is a fermented drug used in China, and now it is very popular in research on the gut microbiota in the world as the intestinal microenvironment impacts the lungs by the gut\u2212lung axis and the brain by the gut\u2212brain axis. We already understand that the gut microbiota are responsible for the health of individuals starting from birth and during early life, adulthood, and aging. MMF is used as a digestive agent where it functions in strengthening the gut and spleen and in balancing the digestive system. In addition, Massa Medicata Fermentata is used for gastroenteritis and dyspepsia with low gastric acidity. 5 MMF is a fermented drug that has been widely used since the beginning of the third century. MMF is used as a digestive agent clinically, and it has the functions of strengthening the spleen and gut and balancing the digestion system. 6 MMF is used for dyspepsia and gastroenteritis with low gastric acidity. MMF is a traditional Chinese medicine with natural fermentation, and MMF is made by Artemisia annua, Polygonum hydropiper, Xanthium sibiricum, red bean, bitter almond, flour, and wheat bran 7 (National Pharmacopoeia Commission. Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (3 Part) [S], 2012). Modern studies have shown that the fermented MMF can improve the disorder of the bacterial system in the gut, and the unfermented MMF does not have these pharmacological activities. According to \"The People's Republic of China Pharmacopoeia 2010\", in a set prescription of fermented herbal medicine, MMF can account for up to 47%. Although MMF has been used for a long time by the Chinese and there is also a huge domestic market today, there are few studies about the fermentation and metabolic processes, and its medicinal ingredients have not been determined. This is resulting in poor controllability of the production and the market. 8 To ensure the safety and effectiveness of MMF for clinical use, we have to study the MMF fermented process and finally to explore the active medicinal ingredients of MMF.",

The fingerprint similarity was 0.943 between day 0 and day 1; 0.103 between day 1 and day 2; 0.525 between day 2 and day 3; 0.715 between day 3 and day 4; 0.487 between day 4 and day 5; 0.387 between day 5 and day 6; and 0.204 between day 6 and day 7. The HPLC fingerprints showed dynamic changes during fermentation, which means that the components and the ratio between components were changing as well. The most significant changes happened during day 1 to day 2. Next, significant changes happened from day 6 to day 7. The fingerprint similarity was only 0.122 between day 0 and day 7. In Figure  2a , peak 1 was rutin; peak 2 was laetrile; and peak 3 was benzaldehyde, and these components were degraded to small molecules by micro-organisms during fermentation. In this study, we found that changes of components of the crude drugs from MMF are significant; therefore, the main components of crude drugs are not the pharmacodynamic components of MMF. In Figure 2a and Table 2 , Massa Medicata Fermentata extracts were analyzed by HPLC. 22, 23 MMF Impacts Propulsion in the Small Intestine. Recent advances in microbiota explorations have led to improved knowledge of the communities of commensal microorganisms within the human body. 24 , 25 We aimed to analyze how MMF influences the propulsion in the small intestine and used the review-manager software 5.3 to analyze the propulsion in the small intestine of MMF using Chinese published literature about MMF, 26\u221228 and there is a significant difference in the propulsion in the small intestine between used MMF mice and unused MMF mice (heterogeneity: Chi 2 = 7.61; df = 3 (P = 0.05); I 2 = 61%; test for overall effect: Z = 7.51 (P < 0.00001), Figure 2b ). When the I 2 value exceeds 25%, 50%, and 75%, it indicates that our study has low, moderate, and high heterogeneity. It is generally believed that I 2 > 50 has substantial heterogeneity. For the Cochrane Q test, the essence is the chi-square test, and the method of qualitative analysis of heterogeneity, P > 0.1, means no statistical heterogeneity between our studies; on the contrary, P < 0.1 means there is heterogeneity between used MMF and unused MMF (Figure 2b ).",
