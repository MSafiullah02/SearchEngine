Acute DAD is characterized by intra-alveolar edema (\nFig. 1) followed by fibrin deposition and formation of hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls (\nFig. 2). In the organizing stage, type II pneumocyte proliferation, granulation tissue, and eventually collagen deposition are seen (\nFig. 3). In addition to DAD, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, and RSV are commonly associated with interstitial pneumonia characterized by leukocytic infiltration of the alveolar septa 10 (\nFig. 4) while the members of the Herpesviridae (CMV, HSV, VZV) and Adenoviridae (Adenovirus) are associated with necrotizing bronchiolitis. Some viruses such as CMV, HSV, VZV and adenovirus also produce characteristic aggregates of nucleoproteins and virions called inclusions as they proliferate within cells (\nFig. 5).9 The location (i.e. intranuclear, intracytoplasmic) and characteristics of these inclusions allow for detection and presumptive identification of the etiologic virus (Table 1).7, 9 Intranuclear inclusions surrounded a clear halo and marginated peripheral chromatin are commonly referred to as \u201cCowdry A\u201d type inclusions and are characteristic of CMV infection (Fig. 5). However, the halo is a non-specific artifact of formalin or ethanol fixation and may be seen with the intranuclear inclusions of other viruses as well. Another cytologic change observed with some viruses (e.g. RSV, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, measles) is fusion of infected cells and creation of characteristic multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs).9 Multinucleated giant cells may also be seen with HSV and VZV infection, but this occurs primarily in stratified squamous epithelium.7\n",

Adenovirus pneumonia presents with manifestations similar to other viral causes of pneumonia, with fever, cough, dizziness and chest pain. Rhinorrhea is less common compared with upper respiratory adenovirus infections.7 A monocytosis may be observed on peripheral blood counts.7 The mortality rates of adenovirus pneumonia are approximately 15% and 60% in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals respectively.15 Treatment consists of supportive measures only.15\n",

In the mid 1900\u2032s, the CDC estimates that there were 3\u20134 million infections and more than 500 measles-related deaths in the United States each year.31 Unfortunately, there have been a number of outbreaks in recent years among unvaccinated populations and therefore pathologists should be familiar with the primary histologic features of infection.31 The hallmark of infection of the lower respiratory tract is giant cell pneumonitis, characterized by multinucleated giant cells that may contain intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions (Table 1,\nFig. 10).32 Of note, the MNGCs found in the lung are different than Warthin-Finkeldey giant cells which are found in reticuloendothelial tissues and don\u2019t have inclusions.7 Other findings include interstitial pneumonia and DAD.7\n",

In tissue biopsy, the histologic response is similar across viruses resulting mostly in various stage of DAD or an interstitial pneumonia with mixed acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Necrotizing bronchiolitis is common and often the clue to search for viral cytopathic changes when present in the backdrop of DAD. Several viruses have characteristic features allowing for their specific identification. However, some features such as multinucleation and Cowdry A inclusions are shared by various viruses and therefore immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization stains are necessary for the identification of the specific virus. Furthermore, many viruses do not cause cytopathic changes and their presence requires high degree of suspicion with confirmation using other methods including conventional microbiology tests. When reporting our findings, we typically first state the morphologic findings followed by either a definitive diagnosis of a virus, as defined by the cytopathic changes and/or ancillary studies or if not definitive, the cytopathic findings and the most likely associated virus. An example of report could read as \u201cAcute necrotizing bronchiolitis and organizing diffuse alveolar damage.
