Advances in endoscopic visualization and instrumentation have greatly expanded the ablative and reconstructive potential of transnasal approaches while concurrently minimizing morbidity and mortality [1]. Although endoscopic skull base surgery has its origins in pituitary and sellar pathology, it is now regularly employed in a vast array of other disease processes. Complex skull base tumors, once reserved exclusively for open craniofacial resection, are often routinely addressed via purely endoscopic techniques. Furthermore, the variety of anatomical sites which are accessible via transnasal approaches has vastly increased. Approaches to the cavernous sinus, clivus, pterygopalatine fossa, and petrous apex are well described in the literature with excellent outcomes [2\u20135].",

            "text": "Recognizing and defining surgical goals prior to intervention is critically important. Goals may vary based upon underlying pathology, patient age/general health, as well as potential morbidity. Evaluating the tumor anatomy is fundamental. Given the relationship to vital structures, total resection is sometimes not technically feasible, or surgical risks may outweigh the benefits [8, 9]. For instance, in sellar-based neoplasms, tumors that extend laterally beyond the cavernous sinus, superiorly through the plane of the hypothalamus and floor of the third ventricle, and/or those with retrosellar extension must be critically assessed given associations with increased morbidity [10]. An exhaustive review of every subsite of the skull base has been addressed in various other studies [11\u2022\u2022, 12]. As a general tenet, endoscopic approaches are ill-suited to pathology that is deep to critical neurologic and vascular structures (that would require transgressing), and alternative approaches should be sought. Beyond anatomical constraints, the natural biology of the tumor must also be considered. Notably for malignant disease, tumor extent may be more significant than appreciated based on imaging alone, and consideration of potential perineural spread may alter the operative plan. In the case of vascular tumors, subtotal resection may increase the possibility of postoperative bleeding and edema leading to mass effect [10]. Despite limitations, indications for proceeding with endoscopic skull base surgery over open craniofacial resection (CFR) continue to expand. Open CFR may be advocated for in select lesions; however, it is worth noting that in the endoscopic era, complication rates for CFR may be higher than historically stated numbers [13].",

First is a more accurate delineation of tumor vascular supply with the potential for mitigation of subsequent operative hemorrhage via transarterial or direct puncture embolization. While not necessary in the majority of cases, the benefit for highly vascular tumors such as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas has been clearly demonstrated in multiple studies [22]. The second notable role for angiography is in the assessment of adequate intracranial collateral circulation. In cases where the internal carotid artery is deemed to be at particularly high risk (e.g., adjacent malignancy, prior radiation, revision surgery), balloon occlusion testing can help to stratify those patients that would be unlikely to tolerate carotid sacrifice and may push either towards a more conservative resection or possibly vascular bypass surgery in the setting of aggressive disease. Angiography, tumor embolization, and balloon occlusion testing carry an inherent level of risk and must be weighed against the potential benefit on a case-by-case basis.",

In a survey of otolaryngologists who perform endoscopic skull base surgery, Wannemuehler et al. assessed intraoperative antibiotic preferences and found that the majority of respondents utilized either a first-generation or third-generation cephalosporin [31]. At our institution, cephalexin is typically used for extradural cases while ceftriaxone is preferred for those cases that extend intradurally. Despite wide variation in reported protocols, the incidence of meningitis remains low. A systematic review of the topic found few published observational studies that precluded meta-analysis and concluded that a large randomized controlled study is necessary to identify the role and optimal antibiotic choice [32].",

With regard to preventing undue pressure on skull base reconstructions, patients are generally kept with their head elevated at 30\u00b0 or higher. Additionally, sinonasal precautions are employed, and patients are instructed to avoid nose blowing, sneeze with their mouths open, restrict the use of straws, and refrain from straining.

When absorbable packing was used, approximately 40% of surgeons prescribed oral antibiotics for 7 days postoperatively. When non-absorbable packing was placed, over 60% prescribed oral antibiotics until packing removal [31]. Our current practice is congruent with these findings, as we typically prescribe oral antibiotics only when non-absorbable packing is placed and cease antibiotic use upon packing removal. A recent systematic review evaluating the need for systemic antibiotic use with nasal packing after sinus surgery found few studies adequately addressing the issue. While no significant benefit (prevention of local nasal infection or toxic shock syndrome) was identified with antibiotic use, all studies evaluated were underpowered to identify a difference [36].",

The duration of packing is also highly variable and typically ranges from 5 to 7 days, though it is important to note that the optimal duration of packing has not been determined by any published studies. Our current institutional practice is for 7 days of non-absorbable tampon sponge packing for any moderate dural defect.

During sinus surgery, they are typically iatrogenic in nature; however, in ablative endoscopic skull base surgery, they are often an intentional consequence of achieving adequate exposure for tumor resection. The overall incidence of CSF rhinorrhea following expanded endonasal surgery has generally been accepted to be around 5% [37]. Leaks may be classified as low-flow or high-flow, with the latter referring to those leaks associated with a large dural defect or violation of a cistern or ventricle [38]. With the advent and increased use of vascularized pedicled flaps for reconstruction, postoperative CSF leak rates have decreased. Consequently, the routine use of lumbar drains in endoscopic skull base surgery has fallen out of favor [39]. A prior meta-analysis demonstrated overall poor quality of available data and no significant benefit of postoperative lumbar drainage [40]. However, a recent large randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients with a high-flow leak (as defined by a dural defect greater than 1 cm, arachnoid dissection, and/or entry into a cistern or ventricle) were 2.9 times more likely to have a postoperative CSF leak if no lumbar drain was placed immediately postoperatively [41\u2022\u2022]. Our current practice has evolved from the rare use of lumbar drains to more selective use with very high-risk defects.",

The benefit of nasal saline on reduced crusting and improved re-mucosalization has been demonstrated by multiple randomized controlled trials following endoscopic sinus surgery and extrapolated to the care of skull base patients [42]. Nasal saline is essentially used by all surgeons, though the method of application (saline spray vs. irrigations) and timing of initiation (immediately vs. starting at 1/2/2+ weeks) varies significantly and is affected by the extent of approach. Repeated postoperative debridements until healing is complete are commonly performed by the majority of surgeons with the initial limited nasal debridement typically occurring around 1.5 weeks postoperatively and initial skull base debridement reserved until approximately 3 weeks postoperatively [31]. The benefit of regular debridement has been called into question in the sinus surgery literature with conflicting reports as to whether this practice positively impacts patient outcomes and raises the question of the ultimate need for postoperative debridements following endoscopic skull base cases [42].",

At our own institution, we follow a similar protocol, with a postoperative MRI or CT performed within 24 h of surgery. Overall, the utility of early postoperative scans depends on its ability to rule out catastrophic events as well as establish a baseline following surgery which may help to differentiate postsurgical changes from tumor recurrence on subsequent imaging.
