Indeed, hospital effluent was and (still) is generally considered of the same pollutant nature as UWW and thus it is commonly discharged in public sewage systems, conveyed to an urban WWTP where it is subjected to conventional treatment, often consisting in primary clarification, activated sludge process and sometimes disinfection. This practice is very common although recent studies (Verlicchi et al., 2010, Santos et al., 2013, McArdell et al., 2011) highlighted that higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals (PhCs), disinfectants and X-ray contrast media occur in hospital effluent as well as a microbiological load exhibiting a higher resistance to treatment (Chitnis et al., 2004).",

Unfortunately, these WWTPs are not adequate enough to reach high removal efficiencies for the wide spectrum of micropollutants (PhCs, adsorbable organic compounds commonly known with the acronym AOXs) commonly present in hospital effluent. They are also among the main sources of antibiotic release into the environment and thus they may promote the selection of antibiotic resistant genes (ARG) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), as deeply investigated in Rizzo et al. (2013). Moreover, in some circumstances, conventional treatments have been adopted for HWW, but they are not well managed and very low efficiencies are achieved even for common parameters, namely BOD5, COD, TSS and total coliform (Mesdaghinia et al., 2009). Sometimes, a simple primary treatment is adopted for hospital effluent (primary clarification, prechlorination) but it is not efficient (Martins et al., 2008).",

As for absorbance removal, the best AOP is O3/UV: in fact the addition of H2O2 led to a scavenger effect on hydroxyl radicals resulting in a lower removal efficiency (see Supplementary data for more details).",

As regards this type of wastewater, special attention must be paid to evaluate the potential inhibition effect on the biological activities of PhCs, heavy metals, disinfectants, detergents that occur at higher concentrations in HWW rather than UWW thus, the risk that they could negatively affect the degradation processes of micro contaminants has to be assessed.",

Long SRT values promote adaptation of different kinds of microorganisms and the presence of slower growing species which could have a greater capacity for removing more recalcitrant compounds while simultaneously improving suspended solid separation (Kreuzinger et al., 2004). Based on data shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 involving removal efficiencies of compounds observed at different sludge ages, it emerges that an SRT equal to 20\u201325 d promotes the removal of atenolol and clarithromycin, slightly higher values (around 30 d) enhance diclofenac and erythromycin removal and around 50 d a larger number of compounds are better removed: naproxen, lidocaine, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and cyclophosphamide.",

This removal reduces to 50% if contrast agents are included. This could lead to the consideration that sewage conveying radiological ward effluent could be separated and treated by a dedicated WWTP, so it could also be possible to recover iodium.",

Ciprofloxacin showed higher concentrations in the effluent rather than in the influent to the treatment. In addition, chlorination seems to be able to remove diclofenac: in the study by Nielsen et al. (2013), its concentration in the influent (MBR permeate) was quite low (< 5 ng/L) and in the effluent it was 1 ng/L (15 min as contact time). But it was found that under lab scale controlled chlorination with surface water, diclofenac exhibited a large degree of reactivity and its final concentration was below detection limit (Westerhoff et al., 2005).",

As a consequence, a high excess of disinfectant is generally applied to guarantee a (rough) disinfection of the hospital effluent, but inevitably extremely high concentrations of residual chloride (as high as 100\u2013130 mg/L) will occur, resulting in serious pollution problems to the receiving aquatic environment, as remarked by Emmanuel et al.

As an example, the effluent produced by the very large laboratory for blood analysis in Pievesestina (Cesena, North Italy, effluent flow-rate about 103\n m3/year) is subjected to ozonation and filtration through activated carbon prior to being immitted into the public sewage system and is then co-treated at the municipal WWTP. Alternatively, the addition of 10 mg/L of ClO2 and a contact time of 30 min guarantee an efficient removal of faecal and total coliforms, with a negligible increment of AOX (Nardi et al., 1995). This increment is consistent if the applied disinfectant is NaClO (Emmanuel et al., 2004).",

This was a decision taken by the local authorities who have even drawn up a specific law for this site (Sipibel Report, 2014).",

Dedicated treatments for hospital effluent are recommended by many authors worldwide, segregation and special treatment seem adequate for specific effluent including effluent generated in radiology wards, containing ICMs, the most recalcitrant compounds, at extremely high concentrations, but also for the effluent from laundries, oncological wards and clinical analysis laboratories, as in the case of the large and centralized Italian lab services discussed above. In any case, dilution with surface water should not represent the proper action to mitigate potential adverse negative effects of PhC residues in the environment.",
