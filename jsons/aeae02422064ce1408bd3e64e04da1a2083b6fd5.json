            "text": "Cryptococcosis is an infectious disease with a wide range of clinical presentations caused by pathogenic encapsulated yeasts in the genus Cryptococcus. Currently, there are two species of these fungi that commonly cause disease in humans: Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes cryptococcosis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts, and Cryptococcus gattii, which is primarily a pathogen in apparently immunocompetent patients but can also cause disease in the immunocompromised. C. neoformans was first identified as a human pathogen in 1894 by two German physicians, Otto Busse and Abraham Buschke, when they described a circular yeast-like microorganism in a lesion on the tibia of a woman; the microorganism was initially named Saccharomyces hominis [1] . The name C. neoformans has been consistently adopted in both the mycology and medical literature since 1950 [2] . In the mid-1970s, when Kwon-Chung discovered two mating types of C. neoformans that produced fertile basidiospores, the organisms were subsequently separated into two varieties, var. neoformans (serotypes A and D) and var. gattii (serotypes B and C). These two varieties were recently separated into two species, C. neoformans and C. gattii, based on their genetic background and phylogenetic diversity, as proposed by Kwon-Chung in 2002 [3] . It is possible, as more molecular information is gathered from genome sequencing, that C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D) and C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A) will be divided into separate species as well as other cryptic species.",

Early case reports of cryptococcal infections were primarily associated with cancer, autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation, and receipt of corticosteroids as these immunocompromised populations expanded [4] . A major surge in new cases of cryptococcosis occurred during the first two decades of the HIV pandemic, when cryptococcal infection was an important opportunistic infection (OI) in all parts of the world. Furthermore, around 2000, C. gattii strains (previously geographically restricted to tropical and subtropical regions) caused a localized outbreak of cryptococcosis in apparently immunocompetent individuals on Vancouver Island [5] . This has increased recognition that these fungi can exploit new geographical environments and cause disease in both immunocompromised and apparently immunocompetent hosts. Despite the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which has decreased the rate of HIV-related cryptococcosis in developed countries, the burden of cryptococcal infection is still very high in developing countries and in those individuals without access to health care. It has been estimated that there are a million cases per year with more than 600,000 deaths due to cryptococcosis worldwide [6] .",

The vast majority of clinical infections and environmental isolates are caused by \"alpha\" mating-type locus strains.

Both cryptococcal species will grow readily on most fungal culture media without cycloheximide at 30-37 \u00b0C in aerobic conditions. However, C. neoformans is generally more thermotolerant than C. gattii, and, within this species, serotype A is generally more tolerant than serotype D strains. In addition to their ability to grow at 37 \u00b0C, the yeast produce a thick shedding polysaccharide capsule, melanin pigments, and the enzymes urease and phospholipase, which allow Cryptococcus to be readily identified from other yeasts. These are also considered to be yeast virulence factors.",

Beginning in the early 1980s, the incidence of cryptococcosis increased significantly and between 6 and 10 % of persons with AIDS developed cryptococcosis [7, 8] . In fact, HIV/AIDS was found to be associated with 80 % of cryptococcosis cases worldwide. Cryptococcal infection is a major OI in HIV-infected patients as the CD4 + cell count falls below 100 cells/\u00b5l. Following widespread implementation of HAART, the incidence of cryptococcosis among patients with HIV/AIDS has fallen significantly in most developed nations. The incidence of cryptococcal infection in persons not infected with HIV has remained stable during this time. Moreover, in developing nations with limited access to HAART, the prevalence of and morbidity and mortality associated with cryptococcosis remains unacceptably high, accounting for up to 600,000 deaths per year. Besides HIV infection, other risk factors for acquiring cryptococcal infections include many conditions that result in an immunocompromised status (Table 15. 2). Although both C. neoformans and C. gattii can cause cryptococcosis in apparently normal hosts, the percentage of C. gattii infections causing disease in such patients is significantly higher than for C. neoformans.",

Recently, there has been a strong link between the C. gattii outbreak in humans on Vancouver Island and common environmental yeast exposures.

            "text": "Cryptococcosis occurs primarily by inhalation of the infectious propagules, either dehydrated (poorly encapsulated) yeasts or basidiospores, into pulmonary alveoli. Direct inoculation into tissue due to trauma can be a portal of entry in occasional cases and, potentially, yeast may enter through the gastrointestinal tract. After the yeasts are inhaled into the lungs of a susceptible host, they encounter alveolar macrophages, and other inflammatory cells are recruited through release of cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, IL-18, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1. Cryptococcal infection primarily involves granulomatous inflammation, which is a result of a helper T cell (Th1) response with cytokines including tumor necrosis factor, interferon-\u03b3, and IL-2 [12] . In many circumstances, the yeasts remain dormant (yet viable) in hilar lymph nodes or pulmonary foci of an asymptomatic individual for years and then disseminate outside those complexes when local immunity is suppressed, similar to that which is observed in cases of reactivation tuberculosis or histoplasmosis [10] . In a patient with severely compromised cellular immunity, the yeasts reactivate and proliferate at the site of infection and then disseminate to other sites causing progressive clinical symptoms. Recent advances in the molecular biology of Cryptococcus have confirmed several virulence factors. The three classical virulence factors of C. neoformans include: capsule formation, melanin pigment production, and the ability to grow well at 37 \u00b0C [9, 12] . The prominent antiphagocytic polysaccharide capsule, which is composed of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), is unique to Cryptococcus species and is considered an essential virulence factor that has multiple effects on host immunity. In addition, C. neoformans possesses an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of diphenolic compounds to form melanin, which may have a biological role to protect the yeasts from host oxidative stresses and which may partially explain the organism's neurotropism. Finally, its ability to grow at 37 \u00b0C is a basic part of the virulence composite for most of the human pathogenic fungi including Cryptococcus, as molecular studies have linked high-temperature growth with certain signaling pathways and enzymes that this yeast has acquired or adapted over time in order to enhance its pathogenicity. Other virulence factors include phospholipase and urease production and multiple enzymes associated with protection against oxidative stresses.",

In a normal host with cryptococcal infection, asymptomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis can occur in about one third of patients with pulmonary infection and patients may present to care with only an abnormal chest radiograph. The most common radiologic findings of cryptococcosis include well-defined single or multiple noncalcified nodules ( Fig. 15 .1) and pulmonary infiltrates ( Fig. 15. 2), but other less frequent radiographic findings include pleural effusions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and lung cavitation. Patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis can present with symptoms of acute onset of fever, productive cough, respiratory distress, chest pain, and weight loss [14] . The outbreak of C. gattii infections in Vancouver Island included several cases of severe symptomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis in apparently immunocompetent individuals. In an immunocompromised patient, especially those with HIV infection, cryptococcal pneumonia is usually symptomatic and can progress rapidly to ARDS, even in the absence of CNS involvement. Most immunocompromised patients with cryptococcal in-fection, however, present with CNS rather than pulmonary symptoms. In fact, more than 90 % of HIV/AIDS patients with cryptococcal infection already have CNS cryptococcosis at the time of diagnosis, many of whom will have a paucity of respiratory complaints. The findings in chest radiographs of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis are the same as those in immunocompetent patients, but alveolar and interstitial infiltrates tend to be more frequent and imaging can mimic Pneumocystis pneumonia. Accelerated presentations of cryptococcal pneumonia are more common among immunocompromised patients. In pulmonary cryptococcosis, if the infection is confined to the lung, serum cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen is usually negative. However, while a positive serum polysaccharide antigen may indicate the dissemination of the yeast from the lung, it does not confirm CNS involvement. In immunocompromised individuals with pulmonary cryptococcosis, a lumbar puncture to rule out CNS disease should be considered regardless of the patient's symptoms or serum polysaccharide antigen test results. The only setting in which screening a lumbar puncture may not necessarily need to be performed in a patient with Cryptococcus isolated from the lung is in the asymptomatic, immunocompetent patient with disease that appears to be limited to the lungs.",

Other cutaneous lesions of cryptococcosis include acneiform lesions, purpura, vesicles, nodules, abscesses, ulcers ( Fig. 15.4) , granulomas, pustules, plaques, draining sinus, and cellulitis. Because there are many skin manifestations in cryptococcosis that mimic other infectious as well as malignant conditions, skin biopsy with culture and histopathology are essential for definitive diagnosis. Skin lesions of cryptococcosis usually represent disseminated cryptococcal infection. Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis is very rare and is usually associated with skin injury and direct inoculation of the yeasts. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients on tacrolimus seem to be more likely to develop skin, soft-tissue, and osteoarticular infections due to Cryptococcus [15] . Tacrolimus has anti-cryptococcal activity at high temperatures, but loses this activity as environmental temperatures decrease; this may in part explain the increased frequency of cutaneous cryptococcosis in these patients. Despite this series of patients, however, the most common site of disseminated infection in SOT recipients still remains the CNS, including patients receiving tacrolimus.",

It is easily distinguished in a colloidal medium of India ink when mixed with CSF ( Fig. 15.5 ). Approximately 1-5 mL of specimen is recommended for use in the India ink preparation. India ink examination can detect encapsulated yeasts in a CSF specimen with a threshold between 10 3 and 10 4 colony-forming units of yeasts/mL of fluid. The sensitivity of the India ink preparation technique is 30-50 % in non-AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis and up to 80 % in AIDS-related disease. Some false-positive results can be found from intact lymphocytes, myelin globules, fat droplets, and other tissue cells. Also, dead yeast cells can remain in the CSF and be visualized by India ink preparation for varying periods of time during and after appropriate antifungal treatment.

Use of serum cryptococcal antibodies for diagnosis of cryptococcosis has not been adopted. In contrast, detection of cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen in serum or body fluids by a latex agglutination (LA) technique has been robust in its performance and is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for serological diagnosis of cryptococcosis. This test uses latex particles coated with polyclonal cryptococcal capsular antibodies or anti-GXM monoclonal antibodies and has overall sensitivities and specificities of 93-100 % and 93-98 %, respectively [28, 29] . The false-positive rate of cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen testing is 0-0.4 % [30] . The majority of false-positive results can be explained by technical error (improper boiling/treatment), presence of rheumatoid factor or interference proteins, and infections with Trichosporon beigelii [31] or some bacterial species [32] . However, most of the false-positive results of LA testing for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen have initial reciprocal titers of 8 or less [28] . Therefore, results of such low titers must be carefully interpreted within the clinical context. Falsenegative results of the LA test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen in cryptococcal meningitis are unusual but can be seen due to a prozone effect, and, therefore, high-risk negative specimens should be diluted and retested [33] . Low fungal burden, as in chronic low-grade cryptococcal meningitis or in the very early stages of cryptococcal infection, and improper storage of patient sera can also cause false-negative results in LA cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen tests [34] .",

A standard induction dose of 0.7-1 mg/kg/day is recommended. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) at 3-6 mg/kg/day has become a preferred alternative treatment with similar outcomes to that of AmBd but with less nephrotoxicity and is specifically recommended for primary induction in organ transplant patients as well as patients at risk for renal dysfunction [62] [63] [64] . Higher doses of AmBd have been shown to be more rapidly fungicidal [65, 66] . Flucytosine (5-FC) is primarily used in combination therapy with AmBd for first-line therapy in cryptococcal meningitis or severe pulmonary cryptococcosis at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day in divided doses in patients with normal renal function [67, 68] . The combination of AmBd and 5-FC represents the most potent fungicidal regimen with more rapid sterilization of CSF cultures at 2 weeks as demonstrated by multiple studies [66, 67, 69] . Early studies from HIV infection demonstrated increased rates of CSF sterilization and fewer relapses with the combination of AmBd and 5-FC followed by itraconazole maintenance [67] . This initial combination regimen has since been compared against multiple alternatives, with the superiority of its fungicidal activity consis-tently confirmed [69] . Similar results have been observed among the most severe cases of cryptococcal infection [66, 70] . Early mycological failure (as defined by persistently positive CSF cultures at day 14) has for many years been associated with late treatment failure and poor outcome [71] , and lack of 5-FC has been independently associated with both early [72] and late [70] mycological failure. The improved fungicidal activity of combination therapy with AmBd plus 5-FC has been shown to translate into a direct survival benefit compared with AmBd monotherapy, with improved survival at 10 weeks lasting up to 6 months [66] . 5-FC should be dose-adjusted for renal dysfunction, with therapeutic monitoring performed 3-5 days after initiation of therapy, to maintain 2-h post-dose levels under 100 \u00b5g/mL (goal , to reduce its primary side effect of bone marrow suppression [73] .",

Alternative combination therapies have been investigated, the most efficacious of which has been AmBd (0.7 mg/kg/day) plus fluconazole (800 mg/day), which has demonstrated improved rates of a composite end point of CSF culture negativity, neurological improvement, and survival compared with AmBd alone or in combination with lower doses of fluconazole [74] . Fluconazole (at doses of 800-1200 mg/ day) in combination with AmBd (standard dosing) has been shown to demonstrate similar rates of fungal clearance from CSF as standard AmBd plus 5-FC in a randomized study performed in HIV-infected patients in South Africa [75] and offers a potential viable option for effective initial therapy in settings where access to 5-FC is limited. Whether the survival benefit observed with AmBd plus 5-FC will be observed with this regimen remains uncertain. Additional alternative regimens for primary therapy are available in the guidelines but their use is not encouraged based on limited data on the success of these regimens [76] . Use of fluconazole in the absence of a polyene is not recommended given the fungistatic nature of this drug, poor success, higher relapse rates, and increased resistance in relapse when used as monotherapy for induction [62, 77] . However, in areas without access to AmBd, high doses (1200 mg/day) of fluconazole should be commenced. CSF sampling should be performed to rule out CNS involvement b CSF sampling can be considered but not required in the absence of neurological symptoms or high serum cryptococcal antigen c If successful response to ARVs (CD4 count > 100 and viral load low or undetectable for > 3 months) and stable serum cryptococcal antigen, can consider discontinuation of antifungal therapy after 12 months of therapy",

However, given concerns regarding immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), the optimum timing for HAART initiation in the setting of OIs has been a subject of much debate. Early retrospective studies suggested an increased risk of IRIS among HIV-infected patients initiated on HAART early after the diagnosis of an OI [85, 86] . More contemporary studies have demonstrated conflicting results regarding outcomes of cryptococcal infection based on timing of HAART initiation [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] . The Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing (COAT) study provides the best evidence for current recommendations regarding timing of HAART initiation in patients with cryptococcal meningitis [92] . HAART-na\u00efve patients were randomized to receive immediate (within 48 h) or deferred (greater than four weeks) HAART following a minimum of 7 days of antifungal therapy with AmBd and high-dose fluconazole. This trial was stopped early after interim analyses suggested poorer early survival among patients receiving immediate HAART (55 % vs. 70 %, p = 0.03), particularly among patients with altered mentation and low CSF white blood cell count. Although a trend toward increased rates of and earlier IRIS was observed in the immediate HAART group, this was not statistically significant.",

Airway colonization in a nonimmunosuppressed individual poses a low risk for invasive pulmonary infection (and dissemination) and treatment can be deferred. Some experts would still favor treatment with fluconazole in this scenario, given the relative benign nature of this therapy. However, among immunocompromised patients with isolated pulmonary cryptococcosis, treatment is recommended to prevent dissemination [62] . It should be emphasized that a thorough evaluation to rule out systemic disease/dissemination is warranted in this group of patients to provide optimal treatment. This includes blood and CSF cultures as well as serum and CSF cryptococcal antigen testing. If the results of the above evaluation are negative, symptoms are mild, and there is no evidence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or ARDS, oral fluconazole (400 mg/day) is recommended for 6-12 months. However, in any patient in whom cryptococcemia is identified, symptoms are severe, ARDS is present, or CSF examination reveals asymptomatic CNS involvement, treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is recommended [62] . Cerebral cryptococcomas often can be managed with prolonged antifungal therapy without need for surgical removal unless mass effect or other evidence of obstruction is identified. At least 6 weeks of induction therapy with AmBd plus 5-FC, followed by 6-18 months of consolidation therapy with fluconazole (400-800 mg/day), is recommended for management. Surgery should be considered for large lesions (> 3 cm) or the presence of obstructive hydrocephalus [62] . Localized infection of extrapulmonary nonmeningeal sites can occasionally occur with direct inoculation, but more commonly represents disseminated infection. Suspicion for the latter must be maintained when Cryptococcus is identified from a sterile body site, as management strategies will differ if disseminated disease is present. Consultation with ophthalmology is indicated in cases of cryptococcal eye disease [62] .",

The differential diagnosis includes progressive disease due to persistent immune deficiency, failure of antimicrobial therapy (due to resistance or nonadherence), coinfection with other OIs, and drug toxicity. A high index of suspicion is necessary for recognizing atypical presentations or manifestations at distant sites. Nevertheless, distinguishing between disease progression related to ongoing immune deficiency and clinical deterioration due to restoration of host immunity has important management implications. CSF analyses and biomarkers may be useful in distinguishing between relapse and IRIS. Prospective studies have demonstrated that CSF opening pressure [89] and WBC count [100, 105] at the time of an IRIS event are significantly higher than baseline values for individual patients, and higher CSF opening pressures can distinguish IRIS from relapsed infection [102] .",

Implicit in management is ensuring the efficacy of antifungal therapy, particularly in settings where access to AmBd may be limited and fluconazole resistance may account for recurrent meningitis episodes [120, 121] . In the absence of disease relapse or direct antifungal resistance, modification of antimicrobial therapy is not indicated [62] . Once the diagnosis of IRIS is suspected, consideration of disease severity is warranted. A significant proportion of minor cases will improve without specific treatment [86, 88, 108] . Corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the need for hospitalization and to improve short-term quality of life and functional status without increased risk of complications in paradoxical tuberculosis (TB)-associated IRIS [122] ; the role of corticosteroids in cryptococcal IRIS, however, is not as well established and should be reserved for life-threatening cases, particularly in light of their association with increased mortality in one study [123] . Other antiinflammatory agents have been used in cryptococcal IRIS, but the number of patients treated with any of these agents is too small to draw substantive conclusions [86, 124, 125] . Other management strategies, including therapeutic lumbar drainage in the setting of intracranial hypertension [62, 122, 126] and, at times, surgical drainage of suppurative lymph nodes [116, 117] , are important adjunctive therapies that may be considered in severe disease.",

An ICP of 250 mm H 2 O or greater is considered elevated and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [123] . Persistently elevated ICP after 2 weeks of treatment is associated with poorer clinical responses among patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [62] . Intracranial imaging should be performed prior to lumbar puncture if impaired mentation or focal neurologic deficits are present. A baseline measurement of CSF pressure should be obtained in all patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis. Aggressive attempts to control increased ICP should occur, if elevated and if there are signs/symptoms to suggest increased ICP (headache, mental status changes, and new focal neurological findings). Treatment options for managing acutely elevated ICP include repeated lumbar punctures (daily until pressure and symptoms are stable for > 2 days), lumbar drain insertion, ventriculostomy, or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt (Table 15 .7) [123] . Medical treatments such as corticosteroids (unless there is a component of IRIS), mannitol, and acetazolamide have been used in some cases, but are generally not recommended for use in management of increased ICP in cryptococcal meningitis [132] . Some patients may develop symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus necessitating the placement of a permanent VP shunt during the first 1-2 years of treatment, and occasionally at initial presentation. Sterilization of CSF is not required prior to placement of a VP shunt, which can be inserted once a patient is receiving the appropriate antifungal therapy [133] .",

Fluconazole prophylaxis has been shown to be effective for preventing cryptococcosis in AIDS patients with persistently low CD4 + cell counts (below 100 cells/\u00b5l) [134, 135] , but due to concerns regarding antifungal resistance, this approach is not currently recommended, and HAART remains the best strategy for the prevention of cryptococcal disease in this population. Routine screening for cryptococcal infection and/or prophylaxis are not recommended in SOT recipients, even when immunosuppression is augmented in patients with previously (appropriately) treated infection [136] . Although cryptococcal GXM-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine and specific monoclonal antibodies to cryptococci have been developed, clinical trials have not been initiated to determine their usefulness in human subjects [137, 138] .
