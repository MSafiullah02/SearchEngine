We observed a distinctive dual peak pattern of influenza epidemic during the A/H1N1 2009pdm in Beijing, China, which was formed by the A/H1N1 2009pdm, and a subsequent influenza B epidemic in year 2009/2010. Our analysis also shows a small peak formed by a seasonal H3N2 epidemic prior to the A/H1N1 2009pdm peak. Parallel detection of multiple respiratory viruses shows that the epidemic of common respiratory viruses, except human rhinovirus, was delayed during the pandemic of the A/H1N1 2009pdm. The H1N1 2009pdm mainly caused upper respiratory tract infections in the sampled patients; patients infected with H1N1 2009pdm had a higher percentage of cough than those infected with seasonal influenza or other respiratory viruses. Our findings indicate that A/H1N1 2009pdm and other respiratory viruses except human rhinovirus could interfere with each other during their transmission between human beings. Understanding the mechanisms and effects of such interference is needed for effective control of future influenza epidemics.",

However this finding differs from the patterns observed in Shenzhen, China, where epidemics of H3N2 and A/H1N1 2009pdm occurred from May to December 2009 and formed a big epidemic peak [33] and in Hong Kong, China, where the epidemics of H3N2 and A/H1N1 2009pdm occurred simultaneously between May and August 2009 [34] . This epidemic pattern is also different from those observed in USA and European countries [6, 7, 11, 35] , where epidemics of H3N2 in summer and influenza B in winter did not occur in 2009. Moreover, compared to nationwide surveillance data from the CNIC, the epidemic peak of influenza in Beijing was higher and appeared 4 weeks earlier than peaks in mainland China (Figure 2 ). One possible explanation for this observation is that Beijing is a city with dense population in which person-to-person interactions, including interactions with other areas and countries, occur more frequently.",

            "text": "It has previously been suggested that the prevalence of HRV may have delayed the circulation of A/H1N1 2009pdm in France [17] . However, we did not detect such an HRV outbreak prior to the peak of A/H1N1 2009pdm (Figure 3) . Meanwhile, in contrast to that observed in previous influenza seasons, A/H1N1 2009pdm did not obviously interfere with the epidemic of HRV and HRV had a relatively long prevalent period (week 40253) during the epidemic of A/H1N1 2009pdm in the winter/spring, 200922010 (Figure 3) , indicating that the influence of A/H1N1 2009pdm on the HRV epidemic may differ from that of seasonal influenza viruses. Potential interactions between HRV and influenza viruses could be implied by known biological mechanisms. The receptors of influenza viruses and HRV are sialic acid alpha 2-6 and human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), respectively [36, 37] . Viruses do not bind the same receptor in cells, thus, the epidemics of HRV and A/H1N1 2009pdm could exist simultaneously. Our finding that 12.8% HRV cases co-infected with A/H1N1 2009pdm in winter/spring 200922010 also suggests this point. The A/H1N1 2009pdm outbreak may have been delayed by the summer epidemic of H3N2 in 2009, in Beijing, because of H3N2 using the same receptors, sialic acid alpha 2-6, as A/H1N1 2009pdm. However, further studies are required to explain the phenomenon that the seasonal influenza viruses H3N2 and H1N1 were not prevalent simultaneously with HRV in 200622009.",

However, the A/H1N1 2009pdm predominately infected young and middleaged adults, consistent with other reports [12, 38] . Our data show that, similar to infection by seasonal influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses, A/H1N1 2009pdm infection is mainly responsible for upper respiratory tract infections. However, we observed different clinical manifestations between infections of A/ H1N1 2009pdm and seasonal influenza viruses as well as noninfluenza respiratory viruses. We found that A/H1N1 2009pdm infection primarily causes cough, whereas seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses primarily cause chills and muscle pain, which is consistent with other reports [38, 39] .",

First, all specimens in this study were taken from adult outpatients for whom subclinical infections for respiratory viruses were not assessed. Second, our study did not include paediatric patients. Third, we did not consider any co-infections with bacteria, a relevant factor between infections with different respiratory viruses and symptom severity [40] . Such co-infections could affect the interpretation of common symptoms associated with different infections. In addition, our data were obtained from PCR screening assays and only representative products were verified by DNA sequencing. Overall, however, these limitations do not detract from the main conclusions of this study.",

We also found that during the epidemic of A/ H1N1 2009pdm, the epidemic of most common respiratory viruses, except HRV, also was delayed. Our findings underscore the complexity of the epidemiological dynamics of A/H1N1 2009pdm and other respiratory viruses and indicate that interference between different viruses might affect their transmissibility between humans [41] . Additional studies are needed to understand the mechanisms and effects of such interference, and these elements should be taken into account for public health decision making to control future influenza epidemics.",

Notably, a smaller peak (45.7%) caused by seasonal H3N2 was observed at week 34 after the initial detection of a A/H1N1 2009pdm case in China, during weeks 27 through 37 of the summer of 2009 (Figure 2 and 3). Surprisingly, subsequent to the A/H1N1 2009pdm peak (85.7%, week 44), an influenza B virus peak (68.6%) was observed at week 4 of 2010 (Figure 2 and 3), overlapping with the pandemic peak caused by A/H1N1 2009pdm (Figure 1, 2, and 3). In contrast, during the winter/spring 200622009, epidemic curves of influenza viruses showed single peaks caused by one major influenza type or subtype (H3N2 in 2006/2007, influenza B virus in 2007/2008, and H1N1 in 2008/2009) (Figure 3). Prevalence of Multiple Respiratory Virus Infections in 2009/2010 Influenza Season To determine if the main pandemic phase of A/H1N1 2009pdm overlapped with respiratory viral infections during week 40 of 2009 through week 18 of 2010 (winter/spring in 200922010), detection rates were compared with those in the previous epidemic seasons (winter/spring in 200622009)(Figure 1, 2 and 3). The results suggest that, in contrast to the observations made in previous influenza seasons, A/H1N1 2009pdm did not obviously interfere with the epidemic of HRV, which was influenced by seasonal influenza viruses (such as H3N2, H1N1, and influenza B virus) in the winter/spring 200622009. Additionally, 12.8% HRV cases were co-infected with A/H1N1 2009pdm in 200922010, whereas ,3% HRV cases were co-infected with H3N2 or H1N1 in 200622009 (data not shown).Other common respiratory viruses, including EV, HPIV, RSV, HMPV, HCoV, and AdV, had no obvious epidemic peaks during or after the dual peaks of A/H1N1 2009pdm and influenza B virus in winter/spring, 200922010. This was comparable to the previous years(200622009)",
