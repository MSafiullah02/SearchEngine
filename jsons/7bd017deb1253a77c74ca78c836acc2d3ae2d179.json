This protein assists viral polyprotein cleavage, host immune interference, and may play other roles in genome replication or transcription. Here, we report the solution NMR structure of a protein from the \"SARS-unique region\" of the bat coronavirus HKU9. The protein contains a frataxin fold or double-wing motif, which is an a 1 b fold that is associated with protein/protein interactions, DNA binding, and metal ion binding. High structural similarity to the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nsp3 is present. A possible functional site that is conserved among some betacoronaviruses has been identified using bioinformatics and biochemical analyses. This structure provides strong experimental support for the recent proposal advanced by us and others that the \"SARS-unique\" region is not unique to the human SARS virus, but is conserved among several different phylogenetic groups of coronaviruses and provides essential functions.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses that infect both humans and animals. Coronavirus infections have a range of severity and include upper and lower respiratory symptoms, with a low frequency of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 1 Acute gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurological symptoms have also been observed. 2 Since 2002, the human coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as significant public health threats. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus is the etiological agent of the 2003-2005 pandemic that affected more than 30 countries. 3 In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus emerged in the Middle East, followed by the spread of the virus to other countries (e.g., the UK, South Korea). As of 2016, there had been 1728 confirmed cases of MERS affecting persons in 27 countries. 4 Prior to these outbreaks, CoVs were known to be responsible for mild upper and lower respiratory infections. For example, human CoV 229E and OC43 cause a minority of respiratory tract infections. 2 Based on phylogenetic and serological analyses, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses has placed the CoVs in four genera, namely the Alphacoronaviruses, Betacoronaviruses, Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses. 5 Under this classification, the betacoronavirus genus has been divided into groups a to d, whereby the SARS-like CoVs are found in group B and MERS-like CoVs in group C. The group D so far has been detected only in bats. 6 Bats are reservoir hosts of multiple zoonotic viruses, including CoVs. Surveillance studies and phylogenetic analyses have shown that high genetic diversity exists among the SARS-like viruses present in bats, allowing for the possibility of recombination and the evolution of new variants. 7 A bat virus with 96% nucleotide sequence identity to the human SARS-CoV was shown to be capable of using the human ACE2 enzyme as a receptor. This demonstrates the same mode of cell entry as the human SARS-CoV. 8 The bat SL-CoV-WIV1 could grow on human epithelial cells and Vero E6 cells, and was neutralized by human SARS convalescent sera. This virus is a possible direct progenitor of the human SARS-CoV. 8, 9 Several group c betacoronaviruses, such as the HKU4, HKU5, and PREDICT/PDF-2180, have been identified in bats from distinct locations around the world. Some genome regions in these bat viruses are highly conserved with respect to the human MERS virus; for example, PREDICT/PDF-2180 shares 97% sequence identity with the MERS virus in ORF1B. 10 It is hypothesized that RNA recombination either in the bat or in an intermediate animal host gave rise to the MERS-CoV. 10 The HKU4 virus, which is derived from the lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus), shares 92.4% RNA polymerase, 67.4% spike protein, and 72.3% nucleocapsid amino acid identity with the MERS CoV and is able to use the same receptor for attachment and entry (the cell surface protein DPP4). 11, 12 The group D betacoronavirus Hong Kong University 9 (HKU9) is also widely distributed, and has been detected in diverse species including Rousettus leschenaulti, Hipposidereos commersoni, Eidolon helvum, and Rousettus aegyptiacus from Asia to Africa. [13] [14] [15] [16] Whether bat CoVs undergo adaptation to intermediate hosts, or are transmitted directly to humans, it is clear that they pose a threat to human health. Hence, it is imperative to understand bat CoV biochemical and biological functions. At present, only one high-resolution structure of a BatCoV HKU9 protein domain is known, the spike protein external receptor-binding domain (RBD). 17 This structure revealed critical new information such as the external subdomain adopting a helical fold versus the beta-sheet topology observed in other beta-CoV receptor domains. As a result, the HKU9 RBD does not bind to the other betaCoV receptors, ACE2 and CD26, underlining the importance of carrying out structural studies on bat proteins. Hence, we have initiated a program to explore bat protein structure-function relationships, with the goal of determining conserved versus divergent functions.",

            "text": "The CoV virion is composed of four structural proteins, which are believed to assist genome packaging, cell entry and virus spread. 2 In contrast, the replicase gene directs the expression of two large nonstructural polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that become mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) after cleavage by viral proteases. These proteins assemble into a replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) that is responsible for RNA genome replication, processing and transcription of sub-genomic RNAs. Interference with the innate immune system, and other interactions with functions of the host cell also localize to the nsps. Several of these functions are essential for viral replication, growth and virulence. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) is a multifunctional protein consisting of sixteen functional domains and 1,922 amino acid residues. 18, 21, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] This protein is the largest component of the RTC. Nsp3 is one of the most divergent regions of the CoV genome. 33 The domain structure of nsp3 is variable among CoVs, 32 with one or two papain-like cysteine proteases, transmembrane regions, RNA-binding proteins, and one or more macrodomains. 27, 34, 35 Key functions of the nsp3 include protein/protein interactions involved in replicase assembly and function; 36 polyprotein processing by the papain-like cysteine protease domain; 37 and deubiquitinase activity involved in innate immune system interference. 38 There are one or more macrodomains in the protein, for which roles in countering the host cell innate immunity have been demonstrated 21, 39 and roles in viral RNA synthesis have been proposed. 40 A \"SARSunique region\" with a three-domain structure was identified in the nsp3 of SARS. 35 The macrodomains in the SARS-unique region were shown to be Gquadruplex binding proteins, and to interact with the RCHY ubiquitin ligase to target p53 for degradation. 35, 41, 42 The smaller C-terminal domain in this region adopts a frataxin-like fold and has been shown to bind purine-rich RNA sequences. 35 In the human SARS-CoV, the functions of this region were essential for viral replication. 43 However, based on discoveries since 2002 and the emergence of other viruses, it has been hypothesized that the \"SARS-unique region\" is in fact conserved in other viruses, in particular in the group B, C, and D betacoronaviruses.",

These residues correspond to the residues 1345-1418 of the replicase polyprotein 1ab of BatCoV HKU9 (Uniprot ID: P0C6W5). The numbering differs because the viral polyprotein is cleaved by the viral protease PLpro to yield the mature viral nsp3. 36, [44] [45] [46] We use the numbering of the mature nsp3 herein. Multidimensional NMR experiments were performed to assign 96% of the observable resonances of the peptide backbone and amino acid sidechains.

The structure determination was carried out based on 3D 15 Table I displays the statistics of the structure calculation, indicating a high-quality structure determination.

We used this consensus server approach to predict functional characteristics of HKU9-C (Table IIB) .",

However, no oligonucleotide binding was detected. A second possibility is that HKU9 C functions in concert with the neighboring macrodomains, which are binding proteins and enzymes acting on ADP-ribose and related metabolites. [57] [58] [59] Structural similarity and binding site similarity to adenylate-binding proteins is also present. Chemical shift perturbation analysis was employed by titrating to 20 times the protein concentration of ADP and ADP-ribose, which are known ligands for macrodomains. 57 Functional predictions based on binding site analysis suggested other possible ligands. To investigate, chemical shift perturbation experiments were repeated with cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), zinc (II) ions, EDTA, and peptides. Again, no changes in the spectrum were observed, suggesting other likely functions for HKU9 C.",

The RMSD value for the MHV C domain from the betacoronavirus lineage A was 2.16 \u00c5 , with a DALI score of 8.7.

In the SARS-CoV, the SUD region interacts with host cell proteins to enhance p53 degradation. 41 The frataxins also have protein binding partners, where the interaction is mediated by side chains that are exposed on the planar face of the b-sheet. It is notable that in the viral proteins, the b-sheet face is smaller and less planar than that of the frataxins. The latter proteins have the b12b2 hairpin in the same plane as the b-sheet [ Fig. 3(A) ]. However, in the b-CoV domains, the b12b2 hairpin wraps over the b-sheet, obscuring the side chains in b22b6 from the protein surface.

The conserved face of the fold [ Fig. 3(B) ] is the only region of the protein that was predicted to have protein-protein interactions, while the other surface regions predicted metal ion and small molecule recognition [Table II(B)]. The b-sheet sidechains are not solvent exposed, but side chains from the b22b3 and b42b5 loops and from the b6 strand could potentially bind small molecules. Interestingly, the metal ion ligands such as Ca 21 and Zn 21 were predicted to bind to the a-helices. To date, we were not able to experimentally confirm any metal ion binding activity or nucleic acid binding activity for HKU9 C. The prediction of a possible protein/protein interaction function is intriguing and awaits further experiment.",

Based on our FFAS (Fold and Function Assignment System) analysis, 65 and on the experimental results reported here, we predict structural conservation between the nsp3 proteins of the human SARS-CoV and bat HKU9. We used this structural alignment to predict the linker regions that would join the HKU9 C domain to the neighboring domains in nsp3. At the N-terminus of HKU9 C, a short, three-residue linker is predicted to join the domain to the neighboring M domain; while at the C-terminus, on the \"conserved face\" of the protein, a seven-residue linker joins the C domain to the papain-like protease of the virus. 36, 44, 66 A longer linker would provide flexibility to accommodate binding partners and interactions. This would coincide with our hypothesis that the conserved face of the protein near the C-terminus may harbor a potential functional site for reactivity or binding to other biomolecules.",
