Owing to the global trend towards improved \u2018quality of life\u2019, the demands for herbal medicines have tremendously grown. Therefore, due to overexploitation, a large number of medicinal plant species are under the threat of extinction (Sidhu, 2010).",

The genus Psoralea of the legume family (Fabaceae) is one among them, which was first established by Linnaeus in 1742. Till 1753, only one species, Psoralea americana (native to America), was recognized and described by Linnaeus. According to The Plant List (2013), Psoralea is a cosmopolitan genus encompassing 105 accepted species, with 23 species reported in Australia and 14 species in the Northern Territory. Two widespread species occur in the Dominican Republic. The name \u2018Psoralea\u2019 is derived from the Greek term \u2018Psoraleos\u2019, which means \u201caffected with itch or with leprosy\u201d (Chopra et al., 2013a, Chopra et al., 2013b).",

Some of the medicinally important compounds obtained from Psoralea species are \u2018psoralen\u2019, \u2018isopsoralen\u2019 (angelicin), \u2018bakuchiol\u2019, \u2018corylifol\u2019, \u2018psoralidin\u2019, \u2018bavachinin\u2019, \u2018corylifolinin\u2019, \u2018caryophyllene\u2019, \u2018\u03b2-farnesene\u2019, \u2018\u03b1-pinene\u2019, \u2018camphene\u2019 and \u2018germacrene D\u2019 (Bertoli et al., 2004, Li et al., 2016, Tava et al., 2007). Although, some species are poisonous, the starchy roots of P. hypogaea Torr. & A. Gray, P. esculenta Pursh and P. macrostachya DC. are edible. At present, there are pharmacological research reports available on only few species namely P. bituminosa (accepted name: Bituminaria bituminosa), P. canescens Michx. [synonym: Pediomelum canescens (Michx.) Rydb.], P. corylifolia L. [accepted name: Cullen corylifolium (L.) Medik.], P. esculenta Pursh, P. plicata Delile [accepted name: Cullen plicatum (Delile) C.H.Stirt.] and P. glandulosa L. P. corylifolia is one among these medicinal herbs which is commonly known as \u2018babachi\u2019, \u2018bakuchi\u2019, \u2018bavachi\u2019, \u2018Indian bread root\u2019, \u2018fountain-bush\u2019 or \u2018scurf pea\u2019 (Alam et al., 2017, Shilandra et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2016). It is a highly valued, endangered medicinal herb that is grown in tropical and subtropical areas of the world (China, Japan, Burma and India) due to its folkloric medicinal properties (Sehrawat et al., 2013). The dried ripe fruit of P. corylifolia is commonly known as \u2018BuguZhi\u2019 or \u2018Poguzhi\u2019 in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (Oudhiya, 2001).",

Psoralen and isopsoralen compounds obtained from Psoralea species are also under trials against syndromes like AIDS (Anis et al., 2005; Bhattacharjee, 1998; Duke, 2009). In a nut-shell, Psoralea species have served humanity as valuable medicinal herbs and are an unmatched remedy for treating leprosy, leucoderma, psoriasis and several other diseases (Ali et al., 2008, Khushboo et al., 2010, Newton et al., 2002, Wong et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2016). But, it is unfortunate that several Psoralea species are vulnerable to extinction due to climate change, overexploitation and interspecific competition. Therefore, meticulous studies on the pharmacological-potential, pharmaceutical-standardization, mode of action of the active constituents, and sustainable conservation of several Psoralea species, are required (Li et al., 2016). In the past few decades, some reports have been published regarding its traditional uses but, a compendious review of its traditional and modern uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and conservation has not been published so far. This review aims to bridge the gap and provides explicit information on the aforementioned parameters by studying six highly exploited species of this genus (Bituminaria bituminosa (L.) C.H.Stirt, Psoralea canescens Michx., Cullen corylifolium (L.) Medik., Psoralea esculenta Pursh, Cullen plicatum (Delile) C.H.Stirt., Psoralea glandulosa L.) which are important from ethnobotanical, chemical and pharmacological point of view. This shall create awareness among the environmentalists, botanists and pharmacists, for sustainable utilization and conservation of Psoralea species.",

            "text": "\nPsoralea species have been used in folklore and indigenous system of medicine for a long time. Several Psoralea products are successfully commercialized and available in the markets (Supplemental information 2, Table S2). The roots of P. argophylla Pursh (Silver leaf scurf pea, Silver leaf Indian breadroot) are eaten raw or cooked (Tanaka, 1976, Yanovsky, 1936). The dried roots may be ground into a powder and used an ingredient of soups and bread (Yanovsky, 1936). A tea prepared from the leaf and stem powder possess anti-pyretic properties (Weiner, 1990). A decoction of the plant is used as a wash for wounds (Moerman, 1998). The root extract is used as a remedy for chronic constipation (Moerman, 1998). Bituminaria bituminosa (L.) C.H.Stirt. (Arabian pea or pitch trefoil) is used as a forage crop. Psoralea canescens Michx. (Buckroot) roots are eaten raw or cooked (Hedrick, 1972, Tanaka, 1976, Yanovsky, 1936). The powdered roots are used in preparation of soups or breads (Yanovsky, 1936). As the plant has analgesic properties, a poultice prepared from roots is applied on painful areas of the body (Moerman, 1998). An infusion of the roots and its steam is used for the treatment of cold, cough, headache and sore throat (Moerman, 1998). Psoralea castorea S. Watson (Beaver Indian breadroot) roots are also eaten raw or cooked and the root-powder can be used in soups or breads (Hedrick, 1972, Tanaka, 1976, Uphof, 1968, Yanovsky, 1936). Psoralea corylifolia L. (Bu Gu Zhi) is revered in Chinese traditional medicine as a tonic to improve general vitality. The name \u2018Buguzhi\u2019 (Fructus psoraleae) actually comprises of three Chinese words: \u2018Bu\u2019 means \u2018to invigorate\u2019; \u2018Gu\u2019 means \u2018bone\u2019 and the third word \u2018Zhi\u2019 means \u2018fat\u2019. The Chinese name of the herb suggests the function of the herb to provide fat for the invigorating bones. One of the most important features of P. corylifolia is that each and every part of the plant is beneficial which includes roots, stems, leaves, seeds and even blooms (Hodges, 2015). Since P. corylifolia is a leprosy destroyer it is revered to as \u201cKushtanashini\u201d in Sanskrit. Moreove, it is an ancient remedy for leucoderma among the traditional system of medicines in India and China and also among the people in the West (Chopra and Chopra, 1958). In Unani system, the plant has been effective against fever, skin diseases and internal ulcers (Chopra and Chatterjee, 1927). It is also found to be an effective anti-helmintic and sedative (Nadkarni, 1976). For treating leprosy and leucoderma the leaves are consumed as powder and also apllied on skin in the form of paste (Anon, 1998; Nadkarni, 1976; Panda, 2000). However, some precaution should be taken when applying the herbal-paste externally, since it can cause a skin-allergic reaction when exposed to sunlight (Anderson and Voorhees, 1980). The leaves are also used to treat dermatitis, inflammation, mucomembranous disorders, oedematous conditions of the skin and to alleviate diarrhea (Rajpal, 2005, Sharma et al., 2001, Krishnamurthi et al., 1969). The plant possesses blood purifying properties and therefore used to treat boils, itching eruptions or red papules, ringworm-infection, extensive eczema, rough and discolored dermatosis with fissures, and scabies (Khare, 2004). The essential oil from plant is reported to have a strong effect on Streptococcal infection of the skin (Rajpal, 2005). Moreover, it is known to improve the color of skin, hair and nails.",

The seeds are anti-pyretic and also possess alexiteric properties and therefore are given in scorpion-sting or snake bite and in bilious disorders (Agharkar, 1991, Kapoor and Boca, 2001, Nadkarni, 1976, Panda, 2000). Both the seeds and fruits contain psoralen (furocoumarin), known to regulate pigmentation (Rashid and Agarwala, 1965, Sebastian, 2006). P. corylifolia seed extracts have been reported to possess anti-hyperglycemic, anti-depressant, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant property (Steven and Russell, 2007, Wang et al., 1990). Seed extract and powder are beneficial as anti-helmintic, laxative, diuretic, and for healing wounds (Rajpal, 2005). They are used as stomachic, diaphoretic and aphrodisiac (Sharma et al., 2001). The major components psoralen (92) and isopsoralen (2) are known to possess anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-tumor properties (Liu et al., 2004). Therefore, the seeds are used for curing various disorders such as cough, asthma, nephritis, alopecia areata, menstruation, uterine disorders and haemorrhages (Qiao et al., 2007, Ruan et al., 2007). The crude extracts of seeds are used in the treatment of febrile diseases, impotence, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, lower back pains, incontinence, enuresis, pollakiuria, and cold symptoms in the waist and knees (Chopra et al., 1956, Lin et al., 2007, Zhao et al., 2005a, Zhao et al., 2005b). It also possesses coronary vasodilatory activity (Ruan et al., 2007). The seeds act as deobstruent and heal ulcers, heart troubles, cure blood disorders and elephantiasis (Anonymous, 1969, Drury, 1873). The extracts also possess cytotoxic, anti-mutagenic and anti-repellant properties (Sah et al., 2006). The seeds are also used to make perfumed oil (Gupta et al., 1979, Nadkarni, 1976). In Japan, the ethanol extract of the seeds has been used as a preservative for pickles and some processed foods (Qiao et al., 2007). The seed cake is rich in nitrogen and minerals and is used as cattle feed or manure (Krishnamurthi et al., 1969).",

A strong fibre is obtained from the inner bark of the stem (Saunders, 2011, Usher, 1974). A fibre is also obtained from the roots, which is used to make ropes and bags (Moerman, 1998, Uphof, 1968). Roots are aromatic and the perfume persists for several months (Saunders, 2011). A yellow dye is also obtained from the roots (Moerman, 1998). Psoralea orbicularis Lindl. (Roundleaf leather root) leaves are cooked and eaten (Moerman, 1998, Tanaka, 1976, Yanovsky, 1936). A decoction of the root is used to purify blood and to treat prexia (Moerman, 1998).

Leaf, rhizome, root, seeds, fruit and resinous extracts of Psoralea species have been subjected to HPLC and HPTLC followed by pharmacological analyses (Pandey et al., 2012, Shailajan et al., 2012, Uikey et al., 2010, Won et al., 2015, Yin et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2005a). Detailed and extensive chemical investigation of six Psoralea species viz: P. bituminosa L. (Syn: Bituminaria bituminosa), P. canescens Michx., P. corylifolia L., P. esculenta Pursh, P. plicata Delile and P. glandulosa L. led to the characterization of a large number of bioactive constituents. Review of literature reveals the presence of altogether 291 chemical constituents including volatile compounds in the aforementioned species (\nTable 1). These chemical compounds have been categorized into coumarins, furanocoumarins, flavonoids (polyphenols), isoflavones, meroterpenes, chalcones, phenols, phenolic cinnamates, phenylpropene, sterols, terpenes, tocopherols, benzofurans, sesquiterpenes, acids, fatty acids, alkyl aldehydes, alcohols and esters (Agarwal et al., 2006, Bertoli et al., 2004, Hsu et al., 2001, Qiao et al., 2006, Ruan et al., 2007, Tava et al., 2007, Yin et al., 2006, Yin et al., 2007, Yu et al., 2005). The chemical structures of 1\u2013291 compounds are shown in the supplemental information (Supplemental information 3, Fig. S1). Their chemical names, chemical class and the corresponding plant sources are compiled in Table 1. The structures of those bioactive compounds which are representative of the genus and with reported pharmacological activities are presented in the main text (\nFig. 2).",

The active principle found in P. corylifolia is bakuchiol (155) and psoralen (92) (Dev, 1999, Wang et al., 2009). Psoralen is linear in structure and may be called as a derivative of umbelliferone (Jois et al., 1933, Rangari and Agrawal, 1992). The production of psoralen enhances when the plant is exposed low dose of gamma radiation (Jan et al., 2011). Isopsoralen (2) is a structural isomer of psoralen (92), and it was found to be identical to angelicin (2) (Jois et al., 1933, Jois and Manjunath, 1934; Seshadri and Venkata Rao, 1937). Angelicin (isopsoralen) (2) is a photosensitizing agent and used for determination of DNA and RNA structures in cells and microorganisms (Kittler et al., 1980). Angelicin (2) and its derivatives occur in a number of plants belonging to the family Umbelliferae. The active compound, bakuchiol (155) is a monoterpene phenol, has been obtained in a pure state and named after Sanskrit name of the plant (Mehta et al., 1973) and possess the potent anti-bacterial property (Satyavati et al., 1987).",

The phenolic compounds obtained from different extracts were found to protect the biological membranes from oxidative stresses (Haraguchi et al., 2002, Guo et al., 2005, Borchardt et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2013, Madrid et al., 2013, Huang et al., 2014). The antioxidant activity of fruit extracts of Psoralea plicata was evaluated by DPPH assay. The study indicated that the methanol extract shows an anti-oxidant activity (288.32 micromol Trolox equivalent/100 g dry material) which is slightly higher as compare to aqueous extract (258,65\u03bcmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dry material) (Cheikh et al., 2015). In a study on P. corylifolia, several bioactive compounds such as bakuchiol (155), psoralen (92), isopsoralen (2), corylin (187), corylifolin (185) and psoralidin (228) were screened for their anti-oxidant potential. Their antioxidant activities were investigated individually and compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and \u03b1-tocopherol by the oxidative stability instrument (OSI) at 100\u00baC Among these compounds psoralidin exhibited highest anti-oxidant activity (5.23) than that of standard compounds (Psoralidin>BHT>\u03b1-tocopherol>bakuchiol>corylifolin>corylin>isopsoralen~psoralen) (Jiangning et al., 2005). However, antioxidant activity alone cannot be of any pharmacological significance. It is accompanied by other specific pharmacological activities to claim any therapeutic benefit.",

Techniques such as disc-diffusion method, UV (ultraviolet), H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance), C NMR (carbon nuclear magnetic resonance), anti-bacterial assay, broth-dilution method, column chromatography, HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) and TLC (thin layer chromatography) were used to quantitate and analyse the anti-bacterial property of these natural compounds (Azzouzi et al., 2014a, Azzouzi et al., 2014b; Bhawna et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2015). Bakuchiol obtained from seed extract of P. corylifolia has been reported to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus mutans and Actinomycess viscosus and hence possess strong anti-bacterial activity and MIC value of bakuchiol was found to be 9.76\u201319.5 \u00b5g/mL (Khushboo et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2011).

Aqueous and methanol extract of seeds and petroleum ether extract of the aerial parts P. corylifolia have been tested against various seed borne fungi such as (Alternaria, Cladosporium, Dreschslera and Rhizophus spp.) of maize. In aqueous extract, maximum inhibition (95.4% inhibition at 50% concentration) was observed against A. alternata followed by C. lunata (86.0%), Rhizopus sp. (82.3%), D. halodes (68.0%) and C. cladosporioides (57.7%). Among the solvents used for the preparation of extracts, maximum inhibition was observed with petroleum ether extract and moderate activity was observed with methanol extract (Kiran et al., 2011). In an anti-fungal assay, the essential oil extracted from P. corylifolia, was studied against three dermatophytic fungi Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The zone of inhibition (by disc-diffusion assay) for M. canis, T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes was found to be 20, 35 and 37 mm respectively, while the minimum inhibitory concentration was reported to be 1.4, 0.4 and 0.5 \u03bcl/mL, respectively (Sharma and Tiwari, 2012). In another study, methanol extract of P. corylifolia seeds was found to be most effective against tomato late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and wheat leaf rust (Puccinia recondite) (Shim et al., 2009). The crude extract of P. corylifolia exhibited significant anti-fungal activity against Candida albicans (Anwar et al., 2011). In a study by Borate et al.

In another study, bakuchiol (155) from P. corylifolia was reported to inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) gene through the inactivation of nuclear transcription factor-B in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Pae et al., 2001). The bioactive compounds obtained from leaves, fruits and seeds of P. corylifolia inhibit the functioning of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and exhibt anti-inflammatory activity (Mueller et al., 2010). The production of inflammatory mediators such as, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor) in PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)/LPS (lipopolysaccharide), in IFN-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was inhibited by neobavaisoflavone (212) (Szliszka et al., 2011a). Cytotoxicity of neobavaisoflavone (212) was tested by using LDH assay (lactate dehydrogenase assay). Psoralidin (228) suppresses the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines which regulate pulmonary inflammation in human lung-fibroblasts and in mice, by ionizing radiation, has been reported (Yang et al., 2011). In a recent study the activity of IL-6-induced STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) was found to be inhibited by bavachin (159), bakuchiol, bavachinin (160), corylin (187), corylifol A (180), neobavaisoflavone (212), and isobavachalcone (203). Hence, these bioactive compounds hold promise to cure inflammatory diseases (Lee et al., 2012).",

(2012), the ethanolic seed extract of P. corylifolia showed an IC50 value of 255 \u03bcg/mL and a considerable anti-psoriatic activity (75.87%), using the mouse tail model. The seed extract converted parakeratosis stage (keratinization) to orthokeratosis (formation of anuclear keratin layer) stage of the cell, thus confirming its anti-psoriatic potential (Dwarampudi et al., 2012). In a recent report, different micro-emulsions containing single and both Commiphora mukul powder and babchi-oil from P. corylifolia were used to assess the anti-psoriatic efficacy on diseased rat paw. The synergistic effect of both the natural products gave better results, hence this herbal combination could be a cheap and effective source of anti-psoriatic agent (Marwaha, 2013). In a study involving human subjects, P. corylifolia hexane-seeds extract was prepared into a cream using stearic acid followed by an open clinical trial on thirty patients suffering from eczema, for a period of one month. The placebo preparation, for this experiment contained all the ingredients except the seed extract. The parameters studied were length of the lesion, exudation rate and rate of itching. The symptoms score reduced after two weeks of cream application. Finally, the length of the lesion reduced from 6.367 \u00b1 1.098\u20130.333 \u00b1 .279, exudation rate reduced from 1.333 \u00b1 .994\u20130.165 \u00b1 .087 and the rate of itching reduced from 2.567 \u00b1 .504\u20130.165 \u00b1 .132. This study concluded that P. corylifolia seed extracts could be used effectively used for the treatment of eczema (Gidwani et al., 2010a).",

            "text": "\nPsoralea species possess unique bioactive compounds with anti-cancer properties. P. corylifolia leaves contain remarkably high concentrations (more than 2 g per Kg dry weight) of genistein (198), the anti-cancer metabolite. Bioactivity of two furocoumarins psoralen (92) and isopsoralen (2) was determined for their cytotoxicity on carcinoma lines KB, KBv200 (vincristine resistance subline of KB), human erythroleukemia cell K562 and K562/ADM (doxorubicin resistance subline of K562). Both the compounds induced apoptosis in these cells thus, confirming their anti-cancer potential. The IC50 values of psoralen were 88.1, 86.6, 24.4 and 62.6, which of isopsoralen were 61.9, 49.4, 49.6 and 72.0, respectively (Wang et al., 2011). Psolaren (92) when subjected to human hepatocarcinoma cells, showed its inhibitory activity by inducing the mechanism of apoptosis. Psoralen (92) was able to inhibit the growth of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and had a strong proapoptotic effect on these cells (Jiang and Xiong, 2014, Khan et al., 2015). The bioactive compounds 7,2',4'-trihydroxy-3-arylcoumarin (263), psoracoumestan (224) and corylifol C (182) from P. corylifolia showed strong anti-cancer potential by inhibiting the enzyme MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation and inducing aptotic cell death (Limper et al., 2013). In a study, psoralidin (228) showed its activity in MCF\u20107 cancer cells (isolated from human breast) by induction of pS2 gene activity, with an EC50 value of ERE\u2010reporter gene transcription activity of 1.85 \u03bcM (Liu et al., 2014). The seed extract of P. corylifolia induced apoptosis in the human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells followed by mitochondrial cell death (Rajan et al., 2014). In another study, psoralidin (228) was reported to generate reactive oxygen species and also inhibited A549 cell proliferation. The method adopted was MTT assay and the IC50 values obtained after 24\u2010, 48\u2010 and 72\u2010h treatment were 19.2, 15.4, and 11.8 \u03bcM, respectively (Hao et al., 2014). Psoralidin (228) and neobavaisoflavone (212) in combination with TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) have showed their anti-cancer property by inducing apoptosis in LNCaP (human adinocarcinoma prostate cancer cells) (Szliszka et al., 2011a). In another report, psoralidin (228) in combination with TRAIL influenced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing the expression of death receptor (TRAIL-R2) (Bronikowska et al., 2012). In a similar report, psoralidin (228) compound obtained from different extracts of P. corylifolia exhibited the anti-cancer activitiy against human lung cancer (A549) cells. Psoralidin dramatically decreased the cell viabilities in dose and time-dependent manner (Hao et al., 2014). Psoralea fructus suppressed the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cell lines, such as LoVo (IC50: 23.3 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcg/mL), SW480 (IC50: 37.9 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcg/mL), HT\u201029 (IC50 value: 40.7 \u00b1 1.5 \u03bcg/mL), and HCT116 (IC50: 45.3 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcg/mL) by decreasing the protein expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4. Succeeding experiments with many kinase inhibitors revealed that P. fructus\u2010mediated degradation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 is dependent on GSK3\u03b2 and/or ERK1/2 (Park et al., 2016). Psoralen (92), isoporalen (2) and bakuchiol (155) identified in P. corylifolia extracts (chloroform and ethanol) have shown their cytotoxic property against HEp-2 cell line (Whelan and Ryan, 2003), BGC-823 cancer cell (Guo et al., 2003) and cultured human cancer cells (SK-OV-3, A549, XF498 and SK-MEL-2HCT15) (Ryu et al., 1992). Bakuchiol (155) is one of the active ingredients of the dried ripe fruit of P. corylifolia. In a study by Miao et al., 2013, bakuchiol (155) suppressed the testosterone induced cell proliferation and gene expression in androgen\u2010dependent prostate cancer (PCa) cell line (LNCaP). The IC50 of bakuchiol (155) to androgen receptor was 8.87 \u00d7 104, which was similar to the standard flutamide (10.00 \u00d7 104). Bakuchiol (155) has also showed a strong anti-cancer action against human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and showed better results than its analogue resveratrol. IC50 of bakuchiol (155) at 72 h was 9.58 \u00b1 1.12 \u03bcmol/L, much lower than that of resveratrol (33.02 \u00b1 2.35 \u03bcmol/L). Compared to resveratrol, bakuchiol (155) triggered the process of apoptosis to a higher level. It was also observed that oxygen species mediated apoptosis contributes to the cytotoxic properties of bakuchiol (155) and can therefore be used against non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer (Chen et al., 2010). Invitro experiments with A2058 melanoma cells using P. glandulosa resinous exudates revealed that it can inhibit the growth of cancer cells after 48 h of treatment. These experiments confirmed the anti-cancer potential of P. glandulosa which can be attributed to the presence of bakuchiol, 3-hydroxy-bakuchiol and 12-hydroxy-isobakuchiol (Madrid et al., 2015b).",

In a similar study on tumor cells of murine origin, radioiodinated bakuchiol showed greater cytotoxic effect than bakuchiol (Bapat et al., 2005). Bakuchiol (155) also induced ER\u03b2 expression and suppressed the ER\u03b1 expression in MCF\u20107 cells (breast cancer cells). It also caused the arrest of S-phase in MCF\u20107 and MDA\u2010MB 231 cells and showed a stronger anti-proliferative effect than resveratrol. Additionally, bakuchiol (155) caused the apoptotic cell induction and interrupted membrane potential in mitochondria of MCF\u20107 cells via an intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The same compound when tested for in vivo anti\u2010breast cancer effect in Zebrafish xenografts showed a significant reduction in MCF\u20107 cell mass (Li et al., 2017). Similarly, two more compounds from the same species identified as isobavachalcone (203) and bavachinin (160) attenuate A\u03b242\u2010induced cell toxicity. The investigation was carried out on yeast two\u2010hybrid system.

The reported side-effects include dermatitis, blistering, edema, renal complications, loose-motions, biliousness, malaise, sleeplessness, annoyance and mental depression. Prolonged therapy has reported to affect liver, eyes, and the immune system (Rajpal, 2005). The psoralen (92) treatment along with UVA can cumulatively cause extensive chromosome damage to mammalian cells and could lead to malignancy. A mixture of psoralen (92), isopsoralen (2), and imperatorin caused hypertrophy of liver, kidney, and spleen in rats at a daily dose of 2.5 mg/75 g for 60 days (Sharma, 2001). In a similar study, different concentrations of P. corylifolia extracts were administered to the rats for 90 days. The treatment decreased the body weight and gonad weight (testes and ovaries) thus indicating psoralen-induced reproductive toxicity (Takizawa et al., 2002). There are several reports on hepatotoxicity symptoms in mice and rats after long-term usage of psoralen or isopsoralen (Khushboo et al., 2010, Totonchy and Chiu, 2014, Wang et al., 2012). In an investigation, P. corylifolia and its natural compounds (bavachin, corylifol A, neobavaisoflavone, IBC, and BCN) were evaluated for their potential toxicity, and the results showed it had a potent inhibitory effect against human UDP\u2010glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) which is considered a stimulant for P. corylifolia related toxicity, including hepatic injury and raised bilirubin levels (Wang et al., 2015). In another study, P. corylifolia extract and fractionated compounds such as psoralen (92) and isopsoralen (2) were incubated with the recombinant CYP3A4 enzyme or differentiated HuH\u20107 and HepaRG cells. P. corylifolia extract, psoralen, and isopsoralen caused the inhibition of concentration CYP3A4 activity in a dose dependent manner with different potency in vitro. It was also noted that none of the sample tested showed any toxicity (Liu and Flynn, 2015). Three cases of liver injury have been reported in Chinese population associated with consumption of P. corylifolia dried seeds (Fructus psoraleae) (Cheung et al., 2009). Pregnant women are discouraged from consuming P. corylifolia (Bensky et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2007). In a case study, a 44-year-old female ingested P. corylifolia seeds every 1 h for seven weeks for treating osteoporosis but, developed acute cholestatic hepatitis (Nam et al., 2005). In another case study, a 64-year-old female developed severe hepatotoxicity after administration for nine months of three kinds of herbal tablets and herbal tea for treating vitiligo. Tablets made from P. corylifolia leaves were identified as the most probable cause of the hepatotoxicity (Teschke and Bahre, 2009, Teschke et al., 2014). However, the underlying hepatotoxic mechanisms of P. corylifolia and its major components are not well elucidated. A text on traditional Chinese medicine reports that no adverse effects of Psoralea occur when a normal dose range (decoction of 4.5\u20139.0 g) is consumed (Bensky et al., 2004). In all the case-studies/experiments on psoralea induced toxicity one thing was found common and that is purposeful/deliberate and continuous/prolonged intake/application of a high dose. Going through the available literature we can conclude that there are mixed opinions about the Psoralea induced toxicity and therefore there is still a research gap with regard to its mode of action and its pharmaceutical standardization.",

To ensure sustained production and benefits of Psoralea products we must aim at its mass cultivation through conventional approaches as well as micropropagation (Koul and Chase, 2015). Psoralea guenzii Harv. has become extinct while species like P. asarina (P.J.Bergius) T.M.Salter, P. fascicularis DC. and P. glaucina Harv. are vulnerable to extinction. Their bioactive principles and mode of action has not been explored yet. Their conservation would also ensure an alternative source of continuous and sustainable supply of elite bioactive compounds such as bakuchiol, psoralen, angelicin and psoralidin, for the pharmaceutical industry (Supplemental information 5, Table S4). Although, reproducible or rapid regeneration protocols for all the Psoralea species are not yet developed, but the same can ensure the enhancement of bioactive compound(s) production in near future, through suspension culture or transgenic technology (Arya and Gothalwal, 2015). These techniques may also streamline the path for further research on the bioactive principles and for the discovery of new compounds with novel properties in future. This is the first report wherein a detailed botanical description, traditional uses, phytochemistry and conservation of Psoralea species has been discussed. To conclude, Psoralea species have immense potential to act as panacea to several health-related maladies and so its conservation before excessive exploitation should be a prerequisite.",
