They contain 15 lg of viral antigens per 0.5 ml dose of two influenza A virus strains and one influenza B strain. Because of the high antigen variability (antigen shift and drift) of the influenza A viruses, the vaccine strains must be adapted annually. Recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) for the composition of the influenza vaccines used in the northern hemisphere are issued in February of each year and concern the virus strains to be included in the vaccine production for the forthcoming winter. In Germany, influenza vaccination has been yearly recommended by the current vaccination committee of the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO) [10] . Regularly repeated immunizations lead to sufficient immunity at the beginning influenza season. Failure of vaccination occurs in up to 30%, most of which have been vaccinated once [2, 3, 5]. Vaccination is specially indicated in elderly persons >60 years, patients with chronic diseases, persons working in hospitals or schools and persons with a high risk of infections. The latest recommendations for influenza vaccination also include patients with disseminated sclerosis, transplanted and carcinoma patients. Influenza vaccine should be avoided by persons with known allergy to eggs or to any components of the vaccine, e.g. thiomersal [8, 10] , and those with an acute respiratory or other active infection.",

The vaccines contain either inactivated viruses extracted with ether and detergents to reduce side-effects (split vaccines) or their highly-purified hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens (subunit vaccines). Therefore, they are not able to induce the influenza. Mild respiratory diseases often observed after vaccination represent in most cases coincidental viral or bacterial infections, like due to adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. To avoid these infections, influenza vaccination should be performed as early as possible; that means at the beginning of the autumn season, before most of respiratory infections occur.",
