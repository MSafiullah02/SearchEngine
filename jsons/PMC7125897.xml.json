As such, proteinases constitute an important target for novel antivirals. The main proteinases responsible for this processing in picornaviruses and coronaviruses are the 3C and 3C-like proteinases (3Cpro and 3CLpro), respectively.1 Picornaviruses include important human pathogens such as human rhinovirus (HRV), poliovirus (PV), and hepatitis A virus (HAV), as well as significant insect, plant and agricultural pathogens, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Coronaviruses include the etiological agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002. Given the significance of these viral pathogens, intense efforts are underway to develop novel antiviral compounds that target 3Cpros and 3CLpros.",

In the central portion of the groove between the two domains, lie the conserved residues of a catalytic triad: the nucleophilic Cys172; the general acid-base catalyst His44; and Asp84, that forms a hydrogen bond to His44.4 This catalytic triad is consistent with other 3Cpro structures identified to date including those of PV, HRV, and FMDV.5, 6, 7 The coronaviral 3CLpros have a similar two-domain \u03b2-barrel fold with a third \u03b1-helical domain that plays a role in dimerization and contributes to the active site pocket.8 Coronaviruses have an active site Cys\u2013His catalytic dyad9 but for both types of proteinases the catalytic mechanism is similar. Following binding of a substrate, the latter\u2019s carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond is subject to nucleophilic attack by the sulfur atom of the active site Cys. Formation of a tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by residues of the electrophilic oxyanion hole, and loss of the amide leads to formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate.4 The catalysis is complete following deacylation and restoration of the active site.",

Indeed, it may be possible to generate broad-spectrum inhibitors of these enzymes. Screening of a 50,000-member library of small molecules revealed a pyridinyl thiophene ester, 1 (Table 1\n), that inhibited SARS 3CLpro with an IC50 of 0.5 \u03bcM.16 This compound also inhibited HAV 3Cpro with an essentially identical IC50. More recently, a library of 82 heteroaromatic esters based on 1 was created and screened against SARS 3CLpro.17 The most potent ester 24 (Table 2\n) inhibited the proteinase with an IC50 of 50 nM. Mass spectrometric analysis suggested a mechanism of inhibition involving acylation of the enzyme by the furoyl group. Slow reactivation of the enzyme further suggested that the acyl-enzyme was subject to deacylation, and that the enzyme catalyzed the slow hydrolysis of the ester.",

This suggested that HAV 3Cpro might catalyze the slow hydrolysis of the ester inhibitor. To investigate this possibility, we developed an HPLC-based assay to monitor inhibitor hydrolysis by HAV 3Cpro and SARS 3CLpro. Reactions were performed using a concentration of pyridinyl ester high enough to ensure enzyme saturation. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture demonstrated that the expected hydrolysis products could be observed in a time-dependent manner concomitant with the disappearance of the ester (Fig. 1\n) and that this hydrolysis was dependent on the enzyme. For each of the tested esters, product identification was confirmed when possible by comparison to known standards. The assay was performed at several concentrations of ester to confirm saturation of the proteinase with the ester and enzymatic hydrolysis rates were corrected for the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the inhibitor.",

By contrast, the enzyme turns over peptide substrates much more efficiently (k\ncat\n = 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 s\u22121 for Ac-ELRTQSFS-NH2\n20 versus 25 \u00b1 8 \u00d7 10\u22125\n s\u22121 for 24). Importantly, the specificity of the viral proteinase for its natural polypeptide substrate has yet to be determined. The presence of an ester linkage is a critical feature for effective inhibition of 3Cpro by the tested small molecules. For example, compounds lacking the ester bond, such as 29, 30, and 61, are poor inhibitors suggesting that these compounds do not interact with the proteinase particularly strongly.",

For example, 60, 66, 68 and 78 moderately inhibited HAV 3Cpro at concentrations of 1 \u03bcM despite the different sizes of the cyclic acid moiety. While the cyclic acid moiety is subject to some constraints, as illustrated by compounds 65, 69, and 78, these constraints are difficult to deduce from the current data set. The spacing between the ester and alcohol or acid moiety was also more critical for the alcohol than the acid. Compound 37 was a good inhibitor despite possessing two additional carbon atoms (\u2013CH\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nCH\u2013) on the acid side of the ester with respect to 20. By contrast, the insertion of a single additional carbon atom (\u2013CH2\u2013) on the alcohol side of the ester of the potent inhibitor 24 yielded 25, a poor inhibitor. Finally, the presence and position of the halogen on the pyridine ring were important determinants of inhibition as was the position of the ring nitrogen with respect to the ester bond. Thus, compounds containing 2- or 4-pyridinyls (2, 4, 11 and 13) were poor inhibitors. Similarly, compounds lacking the halogen substituent (3 vs 45) or in which this substituent is ortho or para to the ester group (15 and 16 vs 45) were also poor inhibitors. Overall, these results indicate that the halopyridine ring is a particularly important determinant of inhibition.",

The ability of the halopyridinyl esters to inhibit two such divergent 3Cpros strongly suggests that these compounds could be used to inhibit the related proteinases of other coronaviruses and picornaviruses such as FMDV and HRV. These inhibitors might be improved by increasing their specificity, presumably by targeting the S2 pocket better, and further slowing their enzymatic hydrolysis. Indeed, given the correlation between turnover of the esters (k\ncat) and non-enzymatic stability (half-life), decreasing enzymatic hydrolysis might improve their stability in aqueous solution. Finally, given the slightly different substrate-binding pockets of the different 3Cpros, a comparison of the inhibition of related proteinases by a series of these halopyridinyl esters might provide insight into the mode of substrate binding and how the physicochemical properties of the substrate-binding pocket determine the excellent specificity of these enzymes.",

Standard assays were performed using 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA containing 0.1 \u03bcM proteinase and 10\u201375 \u03bcM peptide at 37 \u00b0C. Initial inhibitor screening and IC50 determination for HAV 3Cpro were done using a 96-well plate and a Victor2 fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer, Woodbridge, ON, Canada). Substrate (10 \u03bcM) and inhibitor (0.25\u201310 \u03bcM) were prewarmed for three minutes in black 96-well microplates in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl before the reaction was started with the addition of enzyme (\u03bb\nex\n = 355 nm, \u03bb\nem\n = 460 nm). Determination of K\ni was done using a Varian Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary, NC, USA). The assay was performed using a 100 \u03bcL quartz cuvette (\u03bb\nex\n = 340 nm, \u03bb\nem\n = 490 nm for SARS 3CLpro; \u03bb\nex\n = 320 nm, \u03bb\nem\n = 420 nm for SARS 3CLpro). Initial rates were calculated using the first 3 min of the progress curve and were corrected for the inner filter effect as described by Liu et al.,23 using SND(edans)G or Abz-SVTLQ as appropriate. Steady-state equations were fitted to the initial-rate data using the least-squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA.24\n",

The column was operated at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and developed using the following three-step profile: 1 mL 5% acetonitrile in 0.05% formic acid/H2O; 10 mL linear gradient of 5\u2013100% acetonitrile in 0.05% formic acid/H2O; and 1 mL 100% acetonitrile.
