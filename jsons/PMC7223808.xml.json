            "text": "Tailoring the volume of fluid administration remains the cornerstone of fluid resuscitation and haemodynamic status optimization in surgery and intensive care. Older static haemodynamic parameters, such as central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are considered inferior to newer dynamic (functional) parameters that can be used to assess fluid status and predict fluid responsiveness in sedated, paralyzed, and ventilated patients [1\u20134]. Recent guidelines and expert consensus in haemodynamic management of critically ill or high-risk patients also favour the use of dynamic over static parameters whenever possible [5\u20138]. The \u2018era\u2019 of dynamic parameters started more than 30 years ago when the systolic pressure variation (SPV) and its delta down (\u2206d) component were validated [9, 10]; however, other dynamic parameters, namely, stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV) have gained the greatest popularity [11, 12]. Transthoracic (TTE) and transoesophageal (TEE) echocardiography can also be used to assess volume responsiveness during mechanical ventilation via dynamic parameter measurements derived from variations in either aortic flow or inferior vena cava (IVC) flow on TTE or superior vena cava (SVC) diameters via TEE. Only four studies have focused on the SVC collapsibility index (SVC-CI) measured via TEE. These studies found that SVC-CI was an excellent predictor of volume responsiveness in sedated, sinus rhythm, paralyzed and volume-controlled mechanically ventilated patients [13, 14] but only a pretty good predictor whenever one or more of the above conditions are not met [15, 16]. Although SVC-CI is an interesting parameter of fluid responsiveness, the lack of continuity and physicians with experience in performing serial conventional TEE exams makes this approach inaccessible in many hospitals worldwide [16\u201318]. These deficiencies can be obviated through the use of a new miniaturized (5.5-mm in diameter) transoesophageal, monoplane echocardiographic detachable probe (hTEE), which, once connected to a dedicated ultrasound system, can monitor cardiac function and haemodynamic status continuously for up to 72 h (ClariTEE\u2122, ImaCor Inc., Garden City, NY, USA). The hTEE probe provides continuous direct visualization of three views of the heart including: the trans-gastric short-axis, the mid-oesophageal four-chamber view, and the mid-oesophageal ascending aortic short-axis (ME-AA-SAX), the last allowing visualization of the SVC in its short-axis. Currently, this new technology is used mainly in critically ill and post cardiac surgery patients as a qualitative alternative to other methods. It has shown promising results that include a very short training period (only 6 h) [19] and a direct therapeutic impact in 50\u201366% of studied patients [20, 21]. The ME-AA-SAX view is suitable for calculating the SVC-CI based on either the SVC diameter or area variations under mechanical ventilation. Until now, the SVC-CI was studied and validated as a predictor of fluid responsiveness based only on the SVC long-axis view observed during conventional TEE, which focused on the mid-oesophageal bicaval (ME-BIC) view [13\u201316]. SVC-CI measurements were obtained in the M-mode on the basis of SVC diameter variations but never on the basis of SVC area variations [13\u201316]. Importantly, the ME-BIC and ME-AA-SAX views do not interrogate the SVC at the same anatomical level, and therefore, the SVC measurements obtained in the two views are not superimposable. To date, neither the SVC-CI measurement in the SVC short-axis view nor the measurement of SVC-CI using hTEE (hSVC-CI) have been tested against any other dynamic parameter to predict fluid responsiveness. Yet, despite a lack of evidence, some authors have recommended an SVC-CI cutoff value of > 35% [19] or > 30% [22] measured in the SVC short-axis view on hTEE as a safe threshold for fluid administration to restore haemodynamic stability. Therefore, we investigated hSVC-CI versus SVV measurements to predict fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing open major vascular surgical procedures.",

To assess the ability of the variables to discriminate between a +VLT and \u2212VLT, the value of each haemodynamic variable measured before the VLT that led to a +VLT was compared to the VLT measured before a \u2212VLT using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed to test the ability of the variables to predict fluid responsiveness. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were compared using DeLong\u2019s test [27]. A difference between two AUCs was considered statistically significant when the P-value of DeLong\u2019s test was < 0.05. Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated. The optimal cutoff for each variable was estimated by maximizing the Youden index (sensitivity + specificity \u2212 1). We assumed that hSVC-CI would be clinically relevant if the 95% CI of its AUC was more than 0.75, corresponding to an AUC of a good clinical tool, as reported by Ray [28]. Accordingly, we determined that 39 patients had to be included. The statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc (MedCalc, Inc., Mariakerke, Belgium).

A comparison of variables measured at baseline between +VLTs and \u2212VLTs showed significantly higher hSVC-CI (0.44 [0.39 to 0.51] vs. 0.35 [0.32 to 0.36]  % P < 0.0001) and SVV (18.0 [16.0 to 21.0] vs. 13.0 [12.0 to 14.0]  %; P < 0.0001) values and significantly lower CI (2.0 [1.8 to 2.2] vs. 2.5 [2.1 to 2.9] l min \u22121 m\u22122; P < 0.0001) values in +VLTs than in \u2013VLTs (Table 1. Also, CVP values (10.0 [7.0 to 13.0] vs. 11.0 [6.0 to 14.0] mm Hg; P = 0.63) did not show any statistically significant difference between the +VLTs and \u2013VLT groups (Table 1). Discrimination between +VLTs and \u2212VLTs according to haemodynamic parameters was then evaluated by constructing ROC curves (Fig. 2). In the ROC curve analysis, both hSVC-CI and SVV showed good predictivity, with AUCs values of 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.95; P < 0.001) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93; P < 0.001), respectively. No significant difference was found between the two AUCs (P = 0.56). The AUC for CVP (0.53, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.59; P = 0.69) was significantly lower than that for hSVC-CI and SVV, thus demonstrating poor predictivity for this parameter. The AUC for CVP was not significantly different from 0.5. Based on the Youden test, a baseline hSVC-CI cutoff value > 37% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI: 86 to 94) and specificity of 83% (95% CI: 61 to 95). Baseline SVV cutoff values > 15% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 72 to 82) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 85 to 100).",

The potential inaccuracies of the ME-BIC approach related to possible paramedian cuts of the vessel make the ME-AA-SAX approach more advantageous when measuring the SVC-CI diameters. However, in reality, the SVC does not have a perfectly cylindrical shape and is often irregularly shaped on cross-sectional images. The SVC demonstrates an ellipsoid shape as seen on TEE or hTEE in ME-AA-SAX views [31]. In daily practice it is often difficult to select the real \u2018maximum\u2019 or \u2018minimum\u2019 diameter according to the irregularly shaped SVC even in the short-axis view (ME-AA-SAX). Therefore, we presumed that SVC-CI measurements based on SVC area variations in the short-axis view may reflect more accurate amplitudes of SVC changes under mechanical ventilation.

A recent study demonstrated that about 67% of airway pressure changes during mechanical inspiration are transmitted to the pleura, and only 33% to the pericardium and SVC, resulting in a decrease in transmural pressure in the SVC and an unchanged transmural pressure in the right atrium [32]. From the anatomical point of view, the SVC has a proximal (extrapericardial) section and a distal (intrapericardial) one. The mean SVC length is about 7.1 \u00b1 1.5 cm (range 4.4\u20139 cm.). Half of the SVC lies within the pericardium and half lies outside [33\u201337]. The SVC image in long-axis view (ME-BIC) is the distal segment. This part always belongs to the intrapericardial section of the SVC. Depending on the patient\u2019s anatomy, if the patient has a very short SVC (about 4\u20134.5 cm.), the ME-AA-SAX view may show images of the extrapericardial part of the SVC. In any case, the SVC images offered by ME-AA-SAX (short-axis view) are not seen at the same anatomical level as the ME-BIC (long-axis view) but are slightly (1\u20132 cm.) higher (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the SVC diameters and the SVC-CI values measured in ME-BIC and in ME-AA-SAX views, may not be interchangeable.",

Regarding SVV values measured using FloTrac technology, since its introduction, the performance of this uncalibrated technique has improved, particularly under hypo- and normodynamic conditions [40]. The device has been proven to accurately track changes in cardiac output when preload changes [41]. On the other hand, current evidence still shows conflicting results on the FloTrac technology: the system still lacks optimal accuracy and trending ability in cardiac and vascular surgery, and the discrepancy in cardiac output measurement depends on the peripheral vascular tone [42, 43]. The FloTrac 4-th generation software used in our study is both more accurate and more precise even when phenylephrine in low-moderate doses are administered [44]. However, no study was performed with ephedrine or norepinephrine and thus we excluded from the study all the VLTs preceded by the administration of those two drugs.",
