There are controversial data regarding ARB's causing an initial upregulation then downregulation of ACE2 expression during Covid-19 and whether this may result in net harmful or beneficial outcomes. 1 Out of the spotlight, statins have also been implicated in increasing ACE2 expression in animal models. 2,3 Whilst statins carry an anti-inflammatory repute, they have also been associated with increased interleukin levels and mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); though not specifically Covid-19 related ARDS.",

Retrospective data associate baseline comorbidities with a severe course of Covid-19 but details of medications chronically used to treat those comorbidities and the fate of those drugs during the disease course, are not always reported. Scrupulous reporting of such data may also shed light on the concept of cessation of these medications in a prophylactic attempt against contracting SARS-CoV-2. Stopping ARB therapy can precipitate cardiovascular decompensation but cessation for primary preventative indications, as with statins, is a plausible strategy to reduce available receptors for SAR-CoV-2. Although these theories are tempting, especially to the lay-person and media, there are no high quality data upon which to base generalized practice. In an era of evidence-based and heavily litigious medicine, physicians are left in management dilemmas until higher quality research catches up to the pandemic.",

By increasing ACE2 mediated conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1\u00c07), propofol may exhibit a lung protective effect via reduced angiotensin II-induced endothelial dysfunction. 4, 5 This is another area that deserves exploration since to date there are no studies specifically assessing its influence, if any, in Covid-19 related ARDS.",
