They constitute a distinct RTK subfamily with a unique extracellular structure consisting of epidermal growth factor, immunoglobulin, and fibronectin type III domains (Fig. 16.1, Table 16.1). Angiopoietin growth factors (ANGPT1, ANGPT2, ANGPT4, also called ANG1, ANG2, ANG4 in humans) are ligands for TIE2 [5\u20137], while TIE1 is an orphan receptor. Besides the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors, the angiopoietins and TIE receptors define the second endothelial specific RTK signaling pathway. The ANG-TIE system is important for cardiac, blood vascular, and lymphatic vessel development and for the homeostasis of the mature vasculature. The ANG-TIE system also regulates tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and metastasis as well as pathological endothelial inflammation and vascular leak in numerous diseases (reviewed in [8, 9]).\n\n",

Gene-targeted embryos deficient of the Tie2 ligand Ang1 die by E12.5 [5]. They have a very similar phenotype, including impaired cardiac development and less complex vascular structures. In addition, the endothelial cells in the Ang1\n\u2212/\u2212 embryos are rounded and poorly associated with basement membranes [5]. Myocardial Ang1 expression appears to stimulate coronary vein formation, by promoting the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of immature endothelial cells derived from the sinus venosus [19]. Interestingly, cardiac-specific Ang1 deletion during embryogenesis largely phenocopied the ubiquitous loss of Ang1. The deletion of Ang1 after E13.5 was compatible with life; however, postnatal retinal angiogenesis was defective [11, 12]. Ang1 does not appear to be required for normal homeostasis in the adult vasculature, but it is required to limit pathological angiogenic responses and fibrosis after injury or during microvascular stress [11, 12].",

The deletion of both Tie1 and Tie2 causes more severe defects in vascular integrity than single gene deletions, and mosaic analysis has demonstrated that both Tie1 and Tie2 are required in endothelial cells during late phases of embryonic development and in adult tissues [22]. Postnatal conditional deletion of Tie1 decreased angiogenic sprouting in the developing retinal vasculature, but had little effect on mature vessels in adult tissues [13].",

Several approaches to target the ANG-TIE system are in clinical development for the treatment of human cancer, some of these have advanced into phase III trials [43]. In contrast to VEGF, which is highly expressed by many tumor cells, tumor cell lines express very little ANG2 [8]. Instead, ANG2 mRNA expression was detected in cells of the tumor stroma in patients with metastatic CRC [44], in line with preclinical data from mouse tumor models [45]. Interestingly, low pre-therapeutic circulating ANG2 levels were associated with a better response to bevacizumab in CRC patients, suggesting that circulating ANG2 may provide a biomarker for anti-angiogenic therapies in CRC, where bevacizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy [44].",

These studies used different ANG2 and ANG1/ANG2 blocking agents in various mouse tumor or xenograft models, either as monotherapy or in combination with VEGF signaling inhibitors, which showed synergistic effects (reviewed in [9]). Mechanistically, the function of ANG2 in tumor angiogenesis is not well known. ANG2 expression has been detected as one of the first markers of the activated endothelium of co-opted tumor blood vessels. ANG2 is thought to cause endothelial destabilization, leading to vessel regression, hypoxia, and increased expression of both ANG2 and VEGF, which together induce robust angiogenesis in the tumor (angiogenic switch) [45]. However, ANG2 has been also proposed to act as a TIE2 agonist in tumors, promoting endothelial cell survival in the tumor vasculature, where the ANG2/ANG1 ratio is elevated [46].",

In addition, ANG2 blocking antibodies reduced hemodynamic alterations and mortality rate in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis [33]. Furthermore, siRNA silencing of Ang2 in the pulmonary endothelium improved the survival of mice following cecal ligation and puncture, both as a pretreatment and as a rescue intervention [58]. On the other hand, ectopically provided ANG1 alleviated sepsis-induced lung injury [27]. These results suggest that ANG2 promotes, whereas ANG1-TIE2 signaling protects from the drastic consequences of sepsis. The vascular protective signals emanating from ANG1-TIE2 receptor complexes are well studied, whereas ANG2 signaling mechanisms in vascular pathologies are less well understood. However, ANG2 can increase vascular leak induced by many inflammatory cytokines [59]. Decreased Tie2 levels have been reported in the vasculature during septic shock; these may further aggravate the disease [27]. Reduced Tie2 expression was also associated with susceptibility to fatal vascular complications induced by hemorrhagic Ebola virus infection in mice [32]. A recent study demonstrated that when TIE2 levels are reduced or when ANG2 levels are increased, ANG2 can signal via \u03b21-integrin to induce endothelial retraction and destabilization of endothelial cell junctions, a mechanism that may be in place in conditions with increased vascular leak [60] (Fig. 16.2).",

The potential of ANG1 to promote vascular stability and barrier function as well as to stimulate organized vascular remodeling resulting in non-leaky vessels makes ANG1 a potential therapeutic agent in numerous diseases [28, 30]. For example, ANG1 can improve the integrity of lymphatic vessels in inflamed skin after UVB irradiation by modulating expression of tight junction molecules [66]. The recombinant-soluble ANG1 protein, COMP-ANG1, promoted angiogenesis and suppressed inflammation in sciatic nerves of diabetic (ob/ob) mice, suggesting that COMP-ANG1 could improve the morphologic and molecular changes associated with diabetic neuropathy [67]. Adenoviral delivery of COMP-ANG1 also promoted diabetic wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and blood flow [68]. The genetic deletion of Ang1 in adult mice demonstrated that Ang1 limits pathological tissue fibrosis during wound healing and protects from microvascular disease in streptozotocin-induced diabetes [11]. In preclinical mouse models, endothelial dysfunction during hypertension was reduced by expression of the COMP-ANG1 protein. The treatment reduced the hypertension-associated cardiovascular and renal damage and prevented further elevation of blood pressure [69].",

Endothelial specific expression is controlled by transcription factor binding sites in the first intron of the Tie2 gene [83, 85, 86]. In addition, TIE2 is expressed in several hematopoietic cells, most notably in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where ANG1-induced signals regulate HSC niche regeneration and vascular leakiness [74, 77]. TIE2 is also expressed in a subpopulation of type M2 monocytes (TEMs), with tumor and angiogenesis-promoting properties [75] and in the muscle satellite cells, located among skeletal myofibers and associated with the microvasculature [87]. Ang1 derived from the quiescent satellite cells or fibroblasts in the muscle microenvironment promotes satellite cell quiescence for long-term self-renewal of adult muscle stem cells [87].\n",

The mouse sequences for TIE2 similarly feature plenty of single amino acid variants, some of which correspond to human disease variants (for example, mouse R913G and human R915H). Notable is also a single valine insertion after position 786 of mouse TIE2, which is present in some cDNA sequences [29], but absent from others [2, 3, 34, 66]. This results from alternative splicing at the intron 14\u201315 splice donor site. Larger variations involving stretches of 7 to 17 amino acid residues likely represent sequencing artifacts since they represent frameshifted versions of the wild-type sequence with junctions at sites of repeated calls of individual bases [70]. Given the critical location of many of these sequence conflicts, the origin, verification, and documentation of TIE sequences used for experimental research are paramount.",

The presence of the second Ig-like domain was revealed by the determination of the crystal structure of the TIE2 ligand-binding domain (LBD, residues 23\u2013445) in complex with the ANG2 fibrinogen-like domain [103]. The crystal structure (Fig. 16.4) revealed a compact, arrowhead-shaped molecule containing the Ig-like domains (Ig1\u2013Ig3) and the EGF-like domains (EGF1\u2013EGF3). The surface loops of Ig2 are at the tip of the TIE2 arrowhead and alone comprise the ANG2 binding site [103]. Recently, a TIE2 structure including the first FNIII domain (FNIII-1) was solved in complex with the ANG1 fibrinogen-like domain [108].

The kinase domain of human TIE2, residues 808\u20131124, folds into two domains, with catalysis occurring in a cleft between the two [110]. The structure contains an N-terminal domain (residues 808\u2013904) responsible for ligating ATP and a C-terminal domain (residues 905\u20131,124) having the catalytic core. A short kinase insert domain (KID) comprised of two \u03b1-helical segments pack against the C-terminal tail. The overall fold of the TIE2 kinase domain is similar to that observed in other serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase structures. However, the activation loop (A-loop), the nucleotide-binding loop, and the C-terminal tail in the TIE2 kinase domain structure adopt self-inhibitory conformations [110]. The activation loop in TIE2, residues 982\u20131,008, contains a single tyrosine at position 992 and adopts an \u201cactivated-like\u201d conformation. The nucleotide-binding loop contains residues responsible for binding of the ATP phosphate groups. In the TIE2 kinase domain, this loop, residues 831\u2013836, occupies the ATP binding site.

The C-terminal tail of TIE2 contains three tyrosine residues. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, it was demonstrated that five molecules, GRB2, GRB7, GRB14, the non-receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase 11 (PTPN11), and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), interact with TIE2 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner [112]. Mapping of the binding sites of these molecules on TIE2 revealed a multisubstrate-docking site around Tyr1100 (mouse numbering) and a mutation of this site abolished GRB2 and GRB7 binding to TIE2. The p85 subunit of the PI3K has been shown also to associate with TIE2 Tyr1100 (cited Tyr1101 in [110]). This association results in PI3K activation [113]. Targeted mutation of the Tyr1100 in Tie2 showed impaired cardiac development as well as defective development of hematopoietic and endothelial cells in the mutant mice, but unlike the Tie2 knockout mice, the perivascular cells were normally associated with the blood vessels [114]. Site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr1100 reduced the association of GRB2, as expected, but PTPN11 association remained intact [115]. Conversely, the Y1111F (cited Y1112F in [110]) mutation did not affect GRB2 association but decreased association of PTPN11, indicating that PTPN11 is a phospho-Tyr1111-specific signaling molecule. On the other hand, Tyr1106 of mouse Tie2 (1,108 in human) was identified as an ANG1-dependent autophosphorylation site that is required for the binding and phosphorylation of the docking protein Dok-R [116]. Notably, phosphorylation of this Tie2 residue was reduced in Tie1-deficient mice [13]. No tyrosine residue equivalent to Tyr1106 is present in TIE1.",

Mass spectroscopic analysis of fragments generated proteolytically from native ANG1 demonstrated that Cys265 in the coiled-coil domain is involved in covalent homodimerization by an intermolecular disulfide bridge [104]. ANG1 and ANG2 were observed as trimers and dimers, and especially ANG1 is further clustered to form higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers and hexamers, and even higher multimeric forms, in solution [104, 105, 123]. It is thought that the N-terminal region serves as a superclustering region assembling the angiopoietin coiled-coil dimers into higher-order oligomers. The angiopoietin fibrinogen-like domain has been found to bind TIE2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry [104, 121]. Because of the dimeric, trimeric, or multimeric structures of angiopoietins, the expected stoichiometry of the angiopoietin-receptor complex in vivo would be thus 2:2 or higher.",

However, simply bridging receptor molecules appears to be insufficient for TIE2 activation, because ANG2 activates TIE2 only poorly [106].

Monomeric and dimeric ANG1 proteins lacking the coiled-coil and superclustering domains or the superclustering domain alone were able to bind to but not activate TIE2 [104]. An ANG1 variant, ANG1-F1-Fc-F1, with four fibrinogen domains could phosphorylate TIE2 with a similar efficiency as native ANG1 [104]. To improve protein solubility, additional dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric ANG1 fusion proteins lacking the superclustering and coiled-coiled domains have been designed [49]. The pentameric ANG1 chimeric protein, COMP-Ang1, showed enhanced activity in comparison to native ANG1 [49]. The dimeric GCN4 fusion failed to activate the TIE2/Akt pathway, whereas the trimeric Matrilin fusion protein, Mat-ANG1, induced TIE2/Akt phosphorylation similarly as native ANG1. The Mat-ANG1 activity suggests that TIE2 could be activated already by trimeric ANG1 variants. The angiopoietin oligomerization state has been found to regulate subcellular trafficking of Tie2-ANG2 and TIE2-ANG1 complexes and ANG2-mediated cell-matrix interactions [106, 124]. Importantly, it is still not understood which oligomerization state of ANG1 is optimal for TIE2 activation, which ANG1 forms predominate in vivo, or whether the different forms have different signaling functions.",

ANG2 stimulation results also in TIE2 translocation to endothelial cell junctions, but while ANG1 induces TIE2 activation, ANG2 induces only weak TIE2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and may act as an antagonist to inhibit ANG1-induced TIE2 activation [106]. ANG2 is stored in the endothelial Weibel\u2013Palade bodies from where it can be secreted in response to e.g. inflammatory stimuli [137]. Increased ANG2 levels promote endothelial destabilization, whereas in concert with VEGF, ANG2 induces angiogenesis [45]. However, ANG2 has been also suggested to function as an endothelial cell survival factor in stressed cells, where ANG1-stimulated Akt activation is low. In this setting, ANG2 would be induced, via the transcription factor FOXO1 to function as a TIE2 agonist, augmenting Akt activity to provide negative feedback to FOXO1-regulated transcription and apoptosis [138].",

ANG1 also induces the expression of Kruppel-like factor 2, a transcription factor involved in vascular quiescence [140], upregulation of the tight junction protein zonula occludens protein-2 (ZO-2) [141], and activation of sphingosine kinase-1 (SK-1) [142]. ANG1 counteracts VEGF-induced permeability and VE-cadherin internalization by inhibiting VEGF-activated Src via mDia [143]. Another study shows that ANG1 inhibits VEGF-induced nitric oxide (NO) increase and permeability via activation of the atypical protein kinase C-\u03b6 (PKC- \u03b6 (zeta)), which phosphorylates the inhibitory Thr497 residue in endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) [144], while in some studies ANG1 has been shown to induce phosphorylation of the activating Ser1177 in eNOS and NO production [145].

Furthermore, the localization of VE-PTP in cell\u2013cell junctions is promoted by ANG1 [106]. Inhibition of VE-PTP using function-blocking antibodies resulted in enlarged vascular structures in the developing embryonic allantoic membrane [128], as well as in experimental tumors [150]. In addition, a small molecule inhibitor of VE-PTP increased Tie2 activity and suppressed neovascularization in a mouse model of neovascular age-related macular degeneration by stabilizing retinal and choroidal blood vessels [129]. As the TIE receptors undergo significantly less ubiquitinylation following ligand binding than the VEGFRs and are less efficiently internalized and degraded [29], transmembrane phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of TIE2 may be a significant mechanism of TIE2 regulation.",

            "text": "In addition, both ANG1 and ANG2 have been shown to directly interact with different integrin subunits, also in the absence of TIE2. In the tip cells of vascular sprouts, which express ANG2, but less TIE2, ANG2 is expected to stimulate sprouting via integrins [132]. Recently, clues to the binding of ANG2 to \u03b15\u03b21 have been elucidated. ANG2 is able to bind \u03b15\u03b21 integrin in the absence of TIE2, and the molecular mechanism seems to require both integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. ANG2 was found to interact with the tailpiece of the \u03b15 subunit via a region around Gln362 in the C-terminal ANG2 fibrinogen-like domain [133]. In another study, the ANG2 N-terminal domain, but not that of ANG1, was found to induce \u03b15\u03b21-integrin activation [60]. In high glucose environments, such as those observed in diabetic retinopathy, ANG2 stimulated pericyte apoptosis in a process that required the \u03b13\u03b21-integrin, but not TIE2 [64]. ANG1 regulates postnatal retinal angiogenesis; these signals appear to be mediated via astrocyte expressed \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin [12]. During vascular sprouting, the retinal astrocytes secrete fibronectin, a matrix molecule that guides endothelial tip cell migration. Intravitreal ANG1 injection resulted in increased fibronectin deposition, astrocyte distribution, and FAK activation in astrocytes in an \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin-dependent manner, guiding directional sprouting into the avascular region of the retina [12]. In endothelial monolayers silenced for Tie2, and in aortic endothelium of Ang2 transgenic mice, ANG2 activation of \u03b21-integrin resulted in altered endothelial cell-matrix adhesion and the formation of actin stress fibers that promote endothelial retraction and junction destabilization. This alternative Ang2-\u03b21-integrin signalling pathway is likely activated in diseases with increased vascular leak, where Ang2 levels are elevated and Tie2 levels reduced [60]. The integrin dependent functions of angiopoietins should be considered when blocking reagents targeting Ang2 are developed for the treatment of cancer and other human diseases characterized with pathological vascular leakage.",

Due to the vascular stabilization and vessel remodeling signals induced by the ANG1-TIE2 pathway, ways to reinforce this signaling axis are being investigated, including recombinant ANG1 proteins and small molecule inhibitors of the TIE2 inactivating phosphatase, VE-PTP, for alleviating pathological vascularization and endothelial destabilization, as well as stimulating neovascularization of ischemic tissues. In contrast, approaches to neutralize increased ANG2 levels are being developed to counteract its increased activity during inflammation and injury, and in tumors. Furthermore, TIE1 may provide a target for inhibition of atherosclerosis and tumor angiogenesis. However, future work is required to better understand the signaling mechanisms of the TIE1 receptor. In addition, increased understanding of the interplay of the ANG\u2013TIE system with integrins may open up novel ways to better exploit the ANG-TIE system as a therapeutic target.",

Angiopoietin growth factors bind to the TIE2 receptor tyrosine kinase with similar affinity, inducing TIE receptor clustering. The activating ANG1 ligand induces phosphorylation of TIE2, and to some extent also TIE1 in cell\u2013matrix (top, right) and cell\u2013cellFig. 16.1 (continued) (top, left) contacts. In cell\u2013cell contacts, the activated TIE2 receptor signals to stabilize the endothelium after angiogenic processes, and improve the endothelial barrier function, while in cell\u2013matrix contacts, TIE2 stimulates endothelial migration. Pericellular matrix - \u03b15\u03b21-integrin interaction has been reported to promote ANG1-TIE2 signaling for cell survival and cell motility. Vascular sprouting may also involve ANG1 interactions with integrins on non-endothelial cells, such as astrocytes. ANG2 is a weak TIE2 agonist/antagonist, which can counteract ANG1 signaling in cell junctions (bottom, left), especially when its expression is increased, for example, in sepsis. High ANG2 levels also activate \u03b21-integrin, which induces further destabilization of endothelial cell junctions, promoting vascular permeability (bottom, right). In endothelial tip cells, which express ANG2 but low levels of TIE2, ANG2 signals via integrins to promote vascular sprouting. In the tumor vasculature, and in stressed endothelial cells which are exposed to low levels of ANG1 signaling, ANG2 may provide cell survival signals. Deletion of the ligand-less TIE1 receptor inhibits atherosclerosis and tumor angiogenesis, and results in reduced TIE2 phosphorylation in Tie1 gene-targeted mice.

ANG2 was found to signal via \u03b21-integrin when ANG2 levels were elevated or when TIE2 levels were decreased, leading to endothelial \u03b21-integrin activation and cellular tension, which should contribute to reduced barrier function in diseased conditions, such as sepsis [60].
