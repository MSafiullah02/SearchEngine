Aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Infections specific to renal transplant recipients include perinephric fluid collections due to lymphoceles, wound hematomas, or urine leaks; indwelling urinary stents; and UTIs secondary to urinary tract abnormalities, such as ureteral stricture, vesicoureteral reflux, or neurogenic bladder. Most UTIs are caused by common gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas) and gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus). Preventive measures for UTIs include early urethral catheter removal and antibiotic prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin prophylaxis during the first 3 months after transplantation effectively reduces the frequency of UTIs to less than 10% and essentially eliminates urosepsis unless anatomic or functional derangement of the urinary tract is present.",

After primary infection, BK virus preferentially establishes latency within the genitourinary tract and frequently is reactivated in the setting of immunosuppression. In renal transplant recipients, BK virus is associated with a range of clinical syndromes including asymptomatic viruria with or without viremia, ureteral stenosis and obstruction, interstitial nephritis, and BK allograft nephropathy. During the last decade, BK nephropathy has emerged as an important cause of allograft dysfunction after renal transplantation. Most series report that 30% to 40% of renal transplant recipients develop BK viruria, 10% to 20% develop BK viremia, and 2% to 5% develop BK nephropathy. The highest prevalence of BK viruria and viremia occurs at 2 to 3 months and 3 to 6 months, respectively. The risk for development of BK viremia increases when urine viral load is greater than 104 copies/ml, whereas BK nephropathy is unusual in the absence of BK viremia. BK nephropathy commonly presents with an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine during the first post-transplantation year. However, BK nephropathy may occur as early as the first week to as late as 6 years after transplantation. Diagnosis is made by allograft biopsy, which demonstrates BK viral inclusions in renal tubular cell nuclei and occasionally in glomerular parietal epithelium (Fig. 101.4A\n). There are variable degrees of interstitial mononuclear inflammation (Fig. 101.4B), often with plasma cells, degenerative changes in tubules, and focal tubulitis, which may mimic acute rejection. BK nephropathy often is associated with very focal and sharply demarcated areas of tubulointerstitial inflammation, corresponding to foci of viral infection. Immunohistochemistry (Fig. 101.4C), in situ hybridization, or electron microscopy is required to confirm the diagnosis. BK infection and acute rejection may occur simultaneously, and distinguishing between BK nephropathy and acute rejection or the presence of both can be a diagnostic challenge. In late BK nephropathy, few characteristic intranuclear inclusions are seen, and the histologic changes may be indistinguishable from chronic rejection. A histologic classification system for BK nephropathy based on the degree of active inflammation, acute tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial scarring may have prognostic significance.10 Urine cytology for decoy cells and quantitative determinations of viruria and of viral load in blood have been proposed as surrogate markers for the diagnosis of BK nephropathy.",

Although no approved antiviral drug is available, adjunctive therapy with leflunomide, cidofovir, quinolones, or intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may be beneficial, especially in patients with progressive allograft dysfunction. Quinolones are preferred by some centers because of low cost and ease of administration; leflunomide is used by others because of its potential simultaneous antiviral and immunosuppressive properties. Cidofovir is highly concentrated in urine and renal tissue, and the use of low-dose cidofovir in BK nephropathy has been reported to be devoid of nephrotoxicity or serious adverse events. Anecdotal reports have suggested that IVIG may be effective in treating corticosteroid-resistant rejection,11 and its use may be beneficial in patients with concomitant rejection and BK nephropathy or in those with histopathologic changes that are indistinguishable from those of rejection.",

Hence, all renal transplant candidates should have a PPD skin test (tuberculin skin test) placed before transplantation. A positive skin test response or a prior history of TB mandates further evaluation to rule out active disease. Isoniazid prophylaxis for a total of 9 months is recommended for those who have a positive skin test response. Of interest, most of the patients who develop TB after transplantation had negative PPD skin test results before transplantation.13 Some centers recommend isoniazid prophylactic therapy in selected PPD-negative patients with (1) a history of inadequately treated TB, (2) radiographic evidence of granulomatous disease and no history of adequate treatment, (3) an organ from a PPD-positive donor, or (4) close and prolonged contact with a case of active TB.13 In patients with a known history of adequately treated TB infection, we advocate the use of isoniazid prophylaxis for the first 9 months after transplantation and during intensification of immunosuppression. Others, however, have suggested that isoniazid prophylaxis is not indicated for those patients whose TB had been properly treated.12 Clinical, radiologic, or culture evidence of active TB infection is a contraindication to transplantation. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), which detects T cells specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, is unaffected by bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and has become a major advance in TB screening. In some centers, the tuberculin skin test has been replaced by the ELISPOT assays (T-SPOT.TB assay).",

The most frequently used regimens are CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin [Adriamycin], vincristine, and prednisone) and VAPEC-B (doxorubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, bleomycin, and vincristine). Other reported promising novel therapies include ProMACE-CytaBOM (prednisone orally, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide-cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine [Oncovin], methotrexate).25 Adverse effects of chemotherapy include high mortality rates from sepsis and treatment-related toxicities. Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody with murine variable regions targeting the CD20 antigen and human IgG1-\u03ba constant regions, has antitumor activity against CD20-expressing B-cell lymphomas. Early experiences with rituximab (two to six weekly doses of 375 mg/m2) in patients with PTLD (in conjunction with reduction in immunosuppression) have shown promising results. Complete remission rates of 30% to 60% have been reported.24 Although the response rates appear to vary substantially among patients and centers, rituximab in conjunction with reduction in immunosuppression is evolving as the treatment of choice for CD20+ PTLD. The role of cytokine-based therapy, such as interferon alfa and anti\u2013IL-6, remains poorly defined25; increased risk of allograft rejection is seen with anti\u2013IL-6 treatment. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressant with antiproliferative properties, has been demonstrated to prevent proliferation of B-cell (but not T-cell) PTLD-derived tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo.\n26 Limited data from nine European transplant centers have shown tumor regression in 15 of 19 patients with PTLD who underwent minimization or withdrawal of CNIs and sirolimus conversion.27\n",

It has been proposed by experts in the field that immunosuppression dose reduction or withdrawal may permit recovery of the immune system and control the progression of life-threatening malignant neoplasms. The former allows intact immune surveillance against malignant cells. Nonetheless, this approach is not without its attendant risk of graft rejection and graft loss. Furthermore, little is known as to how much and to what extent immunosuppression reduction or withdrawal might alter the natural history of established post-transplantation malignant neoplasms. In our opinion, CNI to sirolimus switch or CNI minimization in conjunction with sirolimus may be a viable therapeutic option (the antitumoral effect of sirolimus is discussed later). In patients with metastatic cancer, manipulation of immunosuppression is probably futile, and the risk of rejection and graft loss necessitating a return to dialysis is likely to outweigh the benefit.",
