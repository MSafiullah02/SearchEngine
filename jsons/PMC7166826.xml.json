Enrolled cases were categorized into three age groups (pediatric: under 15 years of age; adult: 15 to 64 years of age; elderly: at least 65 years of age) and several variables were collected on clinical characteristics, including sex, age, and hospital admission status.

RSV is known as the leading cause of ARI.1, 9, 31 However, the incidence of RSV among positive cases in our study was lower than that reported in other publications.31, 32 It is possible that the incidence of RSV was underestimated in the current study because comparatively small numbers of infants and young children were included. The hot and dry climate of the UAE could also be a possible explanation for the low incidence of RSV in this region.

            "text": "A characteristic semi\u2010seasonality pattern on respiratory viral infection rates was observed in our study. FLU was the main contributing organism to the seasonal pattern; the subtypes A/H1N1/pdm09 and FLU B contributed predominantly to the winter peak. Low temperatures and low specific humidity during the winter season in the UAE may be the cause of the peak in the number of FLU cases in the winter.12 In addition to the major peak in the winter, a small peak in August was also observed for FLU (semi\u2010seasonal pattern), which parallels the patterns reported from temperate and tropical countries in the Northern Hemisphere.5, 8, 12 Most of the respiratory viral infections, including FLU, are more common in the winter in temperate countries.8 However, FLU and RSV infections tend to show annual peaks in association with the rainy season in the tropical area.8, 33, 37 In subtropical areas, previous studies have observed that respiratory viruses, including FLU, peaked in the coldest months in temperate areas.38, 39 The UAE is located in a subtropical area and does not have a rainy season. Thus, we expected a peak of FLU in the winter season, as is common in other subtropical areas.12 However, FLU in the UAE showed a two\u2010peaks semi\u2010seasonal pattern, which has also been observed in some other regions located at similar latitudes (Taiwan and Nepal).8 The majority of the population of the UAE is exposed to a dry, air\u2010conditioned environment for most of the day, especially during the summer season, because outside temperatures range from 39 to 45\u00b0C. Despite this relatively controlled environment, the summer peak of FLU in the UAE could be explained by prolonged effective contact rates, because of the increased indoor activity, and lowered relative humidity, which have been reported to be related to the incidence of viral illnesses.40, 41 This finding implies the potential necessity for sustained FLU vaccination campaigns and repeated vaccinations to reduce the severity of FLU infections, especially for high\u2010risk individuals. Nationwide data are required to confirm the semi\u2010seasonal pattern of FLU in the UAE.42, 43\n",

            "text": "Our study was subject to some limitations. First, this was a single center study with relatively small sample size; moreover, the decision of whether to collect a sample from the patient for viral testing was at the physician's discretion. Physicians in the emergency department may have preferred to perform a rapid influenza antigen test rather than to conduct a multiplex rRT\u2010PCR test, which requires a longer time to produce results. Hence, the incidence of respiratory viruses may have been underestimated because of the low sensitivity of the rapid antigen test, and because viruses, other than the FLU, may not have been identified even if present in the samples.25, 44 Second, our results may not be generalizable to the entire population of the UAE because most of the study specimens were taken from patients in the Northern Emirates. In addition, our study could have underestimated the degree of seasonality in the UAE because the seasonality of viral infections tends to be more apparent when analyses include mild cases that require minimal conservative care (for example, out\u2010patient care in the primary clinic).45\n",

Moreover, the high sensitivity of the detection method enabled the collection of more reliable epidemiologic data. To date, very few studies have provided such data for the middle\u2010eastern region. The seasonality of FLU was similar to that observed in temperate countries and was also consistent with a semi\u2010seasonal pattern of incidence. This knowledge can serve as baseline data for more expansive future surveillance studies of respiratory viruses in the UAE and in the middle\u2010eastern region.",
