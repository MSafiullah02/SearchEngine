There are 4 genera of CoVs: \u03b1CoV, \u03b2CoV, \u03b3CoV, and \u03b4CoV.1 Before the SARS epidemic, the main CoVs causing respiratory tract infection in humans were human CoV-OC43 and human CoV-229E. A novel group, 2b \u03b2CoV, was discovered in March 2003 as the causative agent responsible for SARS-CoV infection.2, 3, 4 Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are \u03b2CoV and belong to lineages B and C, respectively.1 In this article, the clinical features, laboratory aspects, pathogenesis, and potential treatment modalities of SARS-CoV infection and MERS-CoV infection are reviewed.",

A retrospective serologic survey suggested that cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV or its variants from animal species to humans might have occurred frequently in the wet market where a high seroprevalence of 16.7% was detected among asymptomatic animal handlers.10 It was initially thought that masked palm civets might have contributed to transmission of SARS-CoV to humans after detection of a close variant of SARS-CoV from palm civets in Dongmen market, Shenzhen, in 2003.11 During the small-scale SARS-CoV infection outbreaks in late 2003 and early 2004 in China, 3 of the 4 patients had direct or indirect contact with palm civets.12, 13 Viral genomic sequence analysis showed, however, that the SARS-CoV\u2013like virus had not been present among masked civets in markets for long. CoVs highly similar to SARS-CoV were isolated in horseshoe bats in 2005.14, 15 These bat SARS-like CoVs shared 88% to 92% sequence homology with human or civet isolates and the data suggest that bats could be a natural reservoir of a close ancestor of SARS-CoV.16\n",

Based on analysis of the distribution of all confirmed cases, airborne spread was the most likely explanation in the Amoy Gardens outbreak and the SARS-CoV could have spread more than 200 m to nearby residential complexes.41 Air samples obtained from a hospital room in Toronto occupied by a SARS patient and swab samples taken from frequently touched surfaces in rooms and in a nurses\u2019 station in Toronto were positive by PCR testing.42 These data suggest the possibility of airborne transmission and stress the importance of taking appropriate respiratory protection apart from strict surface hygiene practices.",

In vitro activity against SARS-CoV was demonstrated for lopinavir and ribavirin at 4 \u03bcg/mL and 50 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, whereas inhibition of in vitro cytopathic effects was achieved down to a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL of lopinavir combined with 6.25 \u03bcg/mL of ribavirin.57 A retrospective analysis showed that the addition of lopinavir (400 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg) as initial therapy was associated with lower overall death rate (2.3% vs 15.6%) and intubation rate (0% vs 11%) than a matched historical cohort who received ribavirin alone as the initial antiviral therapy.58 The outcome of a subgroup who had received lopinavir/ritonavir as late rescue therapy after receiving pulsed methylprednisolone for worsening respiratory symptoms, however, was not better than the matched cohort.57, 58\n",

A small case series showed 100% mortality in 5 patients who received IFN-\u03b12b plus ribavirin administered at a median of 19 days (range 10\u201320 days from admission).126 A study of 32 patients compared outcomes in 13 patients treated with IFN-\u03b12a (180 \u03bcg subcutaneously once weekly) combined with ribavirin (loading dose of 2 g orally followed by 600 mg orally every 12 h) versus 11 patients treated with IFN-\u03b21a (44 \u03bcg subcutaneously 3 times weekly) combined with ribavirin and found high mortality in both groups and no significant difference between them, 85% versus 64% (P = .24).127 Although an earlier study of 20 patients treated with IFN-\u03b12a combined with ribavirin found an improved survival rate at 14 days, these favorable findings were no longer significant by day 28 (70% mortality vs 83% in a comparator group of untreated patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection; P = .54). The investigators attributed the lack of effectiveness to older age, presence of comorbid conditions, and delay in treatment initiation.128 One case study described the use of lopinavir as part of triple-therapy regimen (in combination with IFN and ribavirin) in a MERS-CoV infected patient who subsequently died in Greece despite initial resolution of viraemia.129\n",

Although the estimated pandemic potential of MERS-CoV is lower than that of SARS-CoV,144 the case fatality rate of MERS is much higher and likely related to older age and comorbid illness of the sporadic cases. Lots of knowledge gaps remain since the first discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012.145 More studies are needed to understand the pathogenesis, viral kinetics, mode of disease transmission, and intermediary source of MERS-CoV to guide public health infection control measures and treatment. It is also important to watch for any emergence and mutation of other SARS-like clusters of circulating CoVs in the bat populations that may threaten human health.146\n",
