However, we do not know the real number of asymptomatic yet infected individuals. The attempt to flatten the curves of infected and lethal cases has led to a worldwide lockdown. This has slowed down the infection rate in Germany. But we also fear that with a low herd immunity a second wave of infection might follow, since no proven antiviral treatment for COVID-19 exists and vaccination is not yet available [3].",

But although myocytes also express ACE2, no viral RNA was detected so far within the cardiocytes themselves. This may be due to the very limited availability of electron microscopy and the lack of in situ hybridization, which allows for exact localization. Or it may indicate nonactivation of the cardiac target cell by TMPRSS2.",

A total of 55 authors (!) have described in an observational study with 66 COVID-19 patients without a control group a beneficial effect in the New England Journal of Medicine [5]. This is truly strange! Future randomized, placebo-controlled studies are planned such as the WHO-sponsored SOLIDARITY trial. It will examine the antivirals ritonavir and lopinavir, which inhibits 3\u2011chymotrypsin-like protease and is in use against HIV, alone or in combination with interferon-beta, remdesivir, which inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and finally chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, which has been used in the prevention and treatment of malaria.
