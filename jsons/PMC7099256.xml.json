Despite the high rate of back up childcare support, our findings suggest that isolation and school closure measures are burdensome both socially and economically, perhaps due to the young age group. Parents have been found to be more likely to take leave to care for young children than for elementary school-age children.32 Parents voluntarily keeping at home children who had not been diagnosed with HFMD during outbreaks was an unforeseen cost of preschool closure policy.
