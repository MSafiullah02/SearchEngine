China was able to bring its first wave of infections under control through the use of social distancing and a rapid expansion in laboratory testing capacity (2) . More than one billion people were confined to their homes across China, including about 13 million people in the rapidly developing city of Shenzhen in southern China. Since the first family cluster of COVID-19 cases identified in Shenzhen in early January 2020, most of the local transmission occurred within household contacts (3), similar to the situation elsewhere in China (4).

The secondary cases were more commonly to be immediate family (such as spouses, parents, siblings, and children) than non-cases (66.7% vs 37.9%, P<0.05). This could be associated with more intense contact than the extended family members. Most of the secondary cases lived together with the index cases, while only half for the non-cases (71.4% vs 51.7%, P<0.05) did so, and there was no secondary case among those not living with the index cases. Our findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that closed environments with prolonged close contact may facilitate secondary transmission (5) , and the transmission rate of infectious diseases within households was much greater than between individuals not living together (6) . Thus, reducing close contact, keep contact distance including separated living environment within household, early quarantine of exposed household contacts and medical isolation of the ill people may be needed to reduce the onward transmission in household.",
