In the 8 years since its entry into force, there have been three declared PHEIC, including pandemic influenza H1N1 in 2009, re-emerging wild-type poliovirus in April, 2014, Ebola virus disease in west Africa in August, 2014, and the emergence of new diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and influenza H7N9, with still uncertain risks to global population health.",
