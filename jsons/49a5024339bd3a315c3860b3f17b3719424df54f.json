For this reason, antiviral drugs have offered an important option to combat avian flu, including H7N9 and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 [10-12]. Currently, two classes of anti-influenza drugs are available. These target the M2 ion channel and neuraminidase (NA) expressed on the virus envelope, respectively. Since 2003, M2 ion channel inhibitors have had extremely limited clinical application as a result of neurological side effects and widespread drug resistance [13, 14] . NA inhibitors (NAIs) are currently the most effective therapy against all strains of influenza A and B viruses [12] . Oseltamivir and zanamivir were licensed and recommended for treatment and prevention of acute uncomplicated flu caused by influenza [12, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Two other NAIs, peramivir and laninamivir, have been approved for seasonal use in Japan and are under clinical evaluations in other countries [19, 20] . Peramivir is also approved for use in Korea and China, as well as the USA. According to surveillance data between 2013 and 2014, 98.2 and 100% of 2009 H1N1 viruses tested for surveillance were susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir, respectively (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/ professionals/antivirals/antiviral-drug-resistance. htm). These drugs have offered new prospects for influenza management. However, virus strains resistant to NAIs are constantly emerging.

First, HA binds to the host cell's sialic acid residues. Second, receptormediated endocytosis occurs, and the virus enters the host cell in an endosome. The endosome has a low pH of around 5 to 6, which triggers the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Following release into the cytoplasm, the vRNPs enter the nuclei of infected cells. Third, when completing the transcription and replication of the viral genome, vRNPs are exported from the nucleus, followed by assembly and budding at the host cell membrane. Fourth, viral particles are released from the cell [24-26]. One of the most important steps that must occur before the newly made viral particle can leave the plasma membrane is the cleavage of sialic acid residue from glycoproteins and glycolipids. Without this process, the viral particle could not be released from the plasma membrane and go on to infect neighboring cells. Recently, the receptor-binding function of NA has been reported [27-34]. Surprisingly, several research groups have reported that NA has acquired the capacity to bind receptors. These reports have challenged the generally accepted concept of NA as an effector during viral fusion and release ( Figure 2 ). Under this new concept, NA can bind receptors on the host cell surface and complement the process of HA receptor binding. A recent report revealed a D151G NA mutant that promoted NA-dependent and NAI-sensitive hemagglutination and caused the attachment of recently isolated human H3N2 viruses via their NA to sialic acid receptors refractory to catalytic cleavage. Although HA is still required for viral entry, the specificity of NA NA sialidase activity is required to free virions from sialylated host mucins decoy during initial stages of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 67, "end": 75, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1278, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "THE LIFE CYCLE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS"}, {"text": "[36]", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE LIFE CYCLE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS"}, {"text": "Influenza A viruses (H3N2, H1N1, H7N7, H7N1)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE LIFE CYCLE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS"}, {"text": "NA plays an early role in infection, providing a further rationale for the prophylactic use of NA inhibitors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE LIFE CYCLE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS"}, {"text": "[37]", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE LIFE CYCLE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS"}, {"text": "Influenza A viruses (H3N2 and H1N1)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE LIFE CYCLE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS"}, {"text": "NA promotes virus entry into target cells during the initial stage of viral infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE LIFE CYCLE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS"}, {"text": "[37-39] appears to complement a deficiency in HA binding. Thus, NA displays two biological activities, including the complementary binding specificities of HA and the cleavage of sialic acid at the early and late stages, respectively, of viral life cycle.

Another laboratory-generated mutant, G147R, enables NA subtype N1 to completely co-opt the receptor-binding function. This new mutation enables some recent human H3N2 isolates to grow to high titers, even in the absence of the HA receptor-binding function. Specifically, G147R NA allows NA to mediate viral infection and RBC agglutination in a manner that can be reversibly blocked by NAIs and anti-NA antibodies [33] . Subsequent studies have shown that the NAs of some human influenza A (H3N2) viruses isolated as early as 1994 had gained such receptor-binding function [34] . However, some researchers still challenge the theory that NA can facilitate virus entry at all [41] .

Notably, applications of viral entry/fusion inhibitors, such as anti-HIV peptide T20 (enfuvirtide), either alone or in combination with other antivirus agents, have become an attractive antiviral strategy [50] . Moreover, small molecules as potential entry inhibitors have been the object of research for many years [51] [52] [53] [54] . To date, however, no drug able to block viral entry is available for the treatment and prevention of influenza. On the other hand, based on the speculated receptor-binding characteristics of NA and studies thus far showing that NA plays a role at the early stage of the virus life cycle, we asked whether NAIs could be developed as entry inhibitors against influenza infection. NA contains a mushroom-shaped homotetrameric glycoprotein with a stalk domain anchored to the viral membrane and a globular head that contains a catalytic site. The active site of NA is composed of 8 functional residues (R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371, and Y406), which are surrounded by 11 framework residues (E119, R156, W178, S179, D198, I222, E227, H274, E277, N294, and E425) (N2 numbering system). These residues are highly conserved in all NA subtypes [55] [56] [57] [58] . Based on the conserved catalytic site, intensive research has focused on structural modification of existing NAIs, as well as the design of novel NAIs, some of which have been previously reviewed [59] [60] [61] [62] .

The principal role of D151 is believed to stabilize the transition state intermediate in the cleavage reaction [65] [66] [67] . The key hydrogen bond between glycosidic oxygen of sialic acid and the residue D151 is a critical interaction for the enzymatic activity of NA ( Figure 4A ). The residue D151 in wild type of NA may function as a \"scissor\" to cleave the sialic acid receptor. Therefore, it is understandable that wild-type NA exhibits no detectable binding to sialosides. However, once the aspartic acid 151 of NA is replaced by glycine, NA is able to bind to the receptor, resulting in the attachment of virus via its NA to sialic acid receptors on red blood cells. The entry of virus carrying NA with D151G mutation could be blocked by NAIs, indicating that G151 locates in the binding site of NA to its receptor [27] . As shown in Figure 4B , the pivotal hydrogen bond of residue D151 involving the cleavage activity of NA is eliminated because of the insufficient length of residue G151 side chain. Therefore, unlike the wild-type NA, binding of the NA with D151G mutation to the \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid receptor does not effectively cleave the receptor but rather mediates the entry of the virus into the target cell.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 231, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 232, "end": 235, "text": "28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 354, "end": 358, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1067, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 520, "text": "Figure 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1091, "text": "Figure 4B", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Development of NAIs with novel mechanism of action by targeting the entry stage of influenza virus"}, {"text": "The receptor-binding characteristics of NA, as described in the preceding texts, alter the specificity of NA mainly through amino acid substitutions in residues 151 or 147 in the NA.

First, NA displays sialidase activity, which cleaves off the terminal N-acetyl neuraminic acid on 2-3 or 2-6 sialic acid moieties of host cells. Then, NA facilitates the release of progeny virions from the host cell, aiding virus transmission. In addition, NA is able to prevent newly assembled viruses from aggregating[15,35]. Several other attributes of NA have been reported in recent years, as summarized inTable 1, indicating that NA may play multiple roles in the viral life cycle, including viral attachment and entry.Recently, it has been proposed that NA may facilitate virus entry into target cells in the initial stage of viral infection, and some attempts have been made to analyze this new role. It is well known that NA promotes virus access to target cells in airways by mucous degradation. Consistent with this hypothesis, some studies showed that NA facilitates the spread of virus through mucous that covers the human airway epithelium. The most likely mechanism is related to removal of decoy receptors on mucins, cilia, and cellular glycocalyx [36,37]. However, lung cancer A549 and MDCK cells, which are widely used as influenza models, do not secrete mucin. It is therefore possible that NA has adopted a novel way to aid in virus entry, and recent studies have demonstrated that NA does, indeed, play a direct and early role in influenza A virus entry. Ohuchi et al., for example, found that NA facilitates virus transfer from an endocytosis-inactive site to an endocytosis-active site, thus facilitating virus entry into target cells, noting that such activity can be blocked by NAIs[38]. Other authors have suggested that NA expression can directly impact HA-dependent influenza virus fusion and virus infection efficiency based on the enzymatic activity of NA [39]. With the unchanged HA, NA replacement in the background of PR8 virus had significant effect on the efficiency of infection initiation, virus release and fusion of infected cells [40]. Such results call for more research to confirm the role of NA in facilitating influenza virus entry to susceptible cells.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "The function of NA in the early and late stages of influenza infection", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "28.
