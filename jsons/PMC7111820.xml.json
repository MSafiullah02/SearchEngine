More than 8400 individuals were infected, and 800 of them died in approximately 7 months over 30 countries. The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Falsey and Walsh, 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Tsang et al., 2003). Although the first SARS epidemic has been successfully controlled, SARS still remains a potential threat to humans because the pathogenesis of SARS is not well understood and no effective approaches to prevent and treat the disease are developed.",

            "text": "As we know, SARS-CoV is a positive-sense RNA virus and the virion consists of a nucleocapsid core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins, spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) (Marra et al., 2003, Tan et al., 2004). The N protein of CoV is a structural component of the helical nucleocapsid and plays an important role in viral pathogenesis, replication and RNA packaging (Hiscox et al., 2001, Narayanan et al., 2003). Furthermore, this protein is more conserved than other proteins of the virus, such as spike and membrane glycoproteins. Among all the coronavirus proteins, the N protein is the most abundant throughout infection at both mRNA and protein levels (Hiscox et al., 2001). Previous studies have shown that the N protein is one of the immunodominant antigens in the CoV family (Boots et al., 1992, Stohlman et al., 1994, Wesseling et al., 1993). In addition, it has been proved that cellular immune response against N protein of some animal coronavirus can generate protective effects (Collisson et al., 2000, Stohlman et al., 1995). Recently, several studies in animals demonstrated that the SARS-CoV N could induce specific T-cell responses (Gao et al., 2003, Jin et al., 2005, Kim et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004), as have been observed with other coronaviruses. Therefore, N protein may be an important target for SARS vaccine.",

From Fig. 3A, it was seen that both of SARS-CoV N-protein-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells would produce IL-2. To establish the relationship between IL-2- and IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells, co-staining for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 expression was carried out and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results indicated in Fig. 3B that T cells specific for N peptides of SARS-CoV could be divided into three subsets based on IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 expression: single IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells; co-expression of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 cells; and single IL-2-secreting cells. The majority of T cells specific for N peptides were single IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells. Compared to CD8+ T cells, higher frequency of CD4+ T cells could express IL-2.

PBMCs from five SARS-recovered donors were stimulated with these six peptide pools individually for 72 hour, and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. The results showed that PBMCs from all of five SARS-recovered individuals had specific T-cell responses to one or more peptide pools based on the production of IFN-\u03b3. But the hierarchy of epitope recognition varied from donor to donor. As shown in Fig. 5A, 100% and 60% of the donors responded to pool V and pool IV corresponding to the sequences of amino acid (aa) residues 293\u2013376 and 219\u2013302 respectively, whereas frequencies of other pools were below 50%. Similar results were also confirmed by the detection of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells using ELIspot assay (Fig. 5B). The results showed that all of four SARS donors responded to pool V and the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells in response to pool V was the highest among six peptide pools. This result suggested that the pool V contained major immunodominant epitopes corresponding to the sequences of residues 293\u2013376 in N protein. Therefore, the pool V was chosen for further mapping the individual peptide responsible for the induction of IFN-\u03b3 expression.",

The N protein was chosen because it was the most conserved protein in SARS-CoV, and it was previously reported to be a major target for the CTL memory response (Collisson et al., 2000, Stohlman et al., 1995). Some studies in animals also demonstrated that the SARS-CoV N could induce specific T-cell responses (Gao et al., 2003, Jin et al., 2005, Kim et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004). In addition, our results demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+T cells were participated in SARS-CoV N-specific memory immunity with a predominance of CD8+ T-cell memory responses in humans.

There is no evidence of persistent SARS-CoV infection, and clinical reinfections with SARS-CoV have never been reported. Viral RNA can be easily detected within the first 14 days of symptomatic SARS-CoV infection, but convalescent samples (50 days after the onset of symptoms) are consistently PCR negative (Xu et al., 2005).

On one hand, periodic re-exposure to the pathogen which serves as a natural \u201cbooster\u201d to the immune system is an effective way to maintain high levels of immunity though such reinfections are usually asymptomatic or only produce mild clinical symptoms. On the other hand, it has been already clear that memory CD4+ T cells and memory CD8+ T cells could persist in the absence of antigen in mice (Murali-Krishna et al., 1999, Lau et al., 1994). Furthermore, memory CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells could be maintained for decades after smallpox vaccination in human (Hammarlund et al., 2003). Since vaccinia virus does not cause a chronic infection in humans and re-exposure to the virus is unlikely, the maintenance of T-cell memory in this system also appears to be antigen-independent.

In these two subsets, CCR7\u2212 effector memory T cells (TEM cells) would be present in the blood, spleen and nonlymphoid tissues, whereas CCR7+ central memory T cells (TCM cells) would be present in lymphoid, spleen and blood but not in nonlymphoid tissues. Recent studies of both in mice and humans have demonstrated that both cell subsets can rapidly produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 but that IL-2 production remains a property of TEM cells following stimulation with cognate antigen (Harari et al., 2005, Lier et al., 2003, Wherry and Ahmed, 2004, Wills et al., 2002). Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells from SARS-recovered donors rapidly produced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 following a short-term stimulation with N peptides. IL-2-secreting CD4+ memory T cells were more than those of CD8+ memory T cells. Phenotypic analysis suggested that a higher proportion of IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells were CD45RA+CCR7\u2212 compared with those of IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T cells. These larger numbers of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells were TEM cells and produced less IL-2 compared with those of IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T cells. Similar observations were also obtained in CMV infection in which reactive CD8+ T cells expressed CD45RA during recovery (Wills et al., 2002) and a larger number of IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells were CD45RA+ CCR7\u2212 compared with those of IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T cells (Seder and Ahmed, 2003).",

The clear difference in protein recognition among SARS-CoV immune donors suggests that the nature and composition of the immune response against the virus vary between individuals possibly due to the difference in HLA types. Although the results showed that the T-cell epitopes were scattered throughout the sequence of N protein, some peptides were recognized more frequently than others. The peptides that were frequently recognized by T cells were N46 (aa 331 to 347), N47 (aa 339 to 354) and N48 (aa 346 to 362). Therefore, a cluster of peptides corresponding to aa 331 to 362 were the major dominant antigenic site on N protein and contained at least two different T-cell epitopes (N46 and N48). IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells specific to these two epitopes were from 25.7% to 65% of total N-protein-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells in four SARS donors based on ELIspot assays.",

Our results suggest that the C-terminal end of N protein may be highly immunogenic. This had been confirmed by Kim et al. who observed a strong T-cell response to the N peptides at aa 346 to 354 when mice were immunized with N protein (Kim et al., 2004). These peptides were overlapped with the peptide N47 and peptide N48 in our study. Like other CoVs, SARS-CoV N proteins clearly contain multiple immunodominant epitopes and antigenic sites (Stohlman et al., 1994). Several groups have been extensively studied for B-cell epitopes of N protein in SARS patients (Chen et al., 2004, He et al., 2004, Liang et al., 2005, Lin et al., 2003, Zhong et al., 2005). He and his co-workers demonstrated that two major immunodominant epitopes that reacted with more than 75% of sera from SARS patients were localized at the C-terminal and middle regions, corresponding to aa 362 to 412 and 153 to 178, respectively (He et al., 2004). This suggests that B cells and T cells target to distinct regions of the N protein during the immune response to SARS-CoV. This may be an important consideration in the design of effective vaccines capable of eliciting both humoral and cellular responses.",

The highest frequencies of SARS-CoV N46-specific T cells measured in our study were 12\u201390/106 PBMCs. Influenza virus can periodically reinfect individuals with existing influenza virus-specific T-cell memory and thus boost T-cell responses. However, periodic exposures to SARS-CoV have never occurred and secondary infections have never been reported for this. Thus, the memory T-cell response of SARS-CoV is unlikely to be effectively boosted. Overall, the frequencies of SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells measured in our study are comparable to those measured in other acute virus infections such as influenza. This system could provide a model system of T-cell memory to study the maintenance of antiviral T-cell memory in humans after an acute infection in the absence of antigen.",
