The decision of when to re-start elective procedures will be a complicated one being affected by societal, political, geographic, economic and health related factors. Once such normalcy resumes, we have to entertain the major question of what changes we will need to introduce in our practices to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from infected hosts to others. We will also need to be cognizant of the potential for re-infection with the virus and the emergence of a second wave.",

            "text": "While any discussion regarding a SARS-CoV-2 \u2018reinfection\u2019 remains theoretical, a few recent articles have raised this possibility [12,13]. If such a phenomenon is indeed possible, three distinct explanations exist. First, patients who contract the disease do not develop lasting immunity against the virus and are just as vulnerable as those without a prior infection in contracting the disease. Second, there are issues with the accuracy of the test, with false positives and false negatives existing. So, it is possible that some of these presumed reinfections are a result of the re-test being a false negative result which was incorrectly interpreted as the individual being declared as \u201ccured\u201d. Finally, it is plausible, and indeed scientifically proven [[14], [15], [16], [17]], that viruses undergo marked genetic mutations, even during an active pandemic. Hence those infected with the virus develop partial immunity and are still vulnerable for infection with the \u2018new\u2019 mutated version of the virus [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. We are familiar with the concept of partial immunity as it relates to the flu-vaccine, as it affords only 60-70% immunity against the disease in any given year [18]. Based on scientific data, the genetic footprint of the initial SARS-CoV-2 affecting individuals in Wuhan is different than the RNA sequence of the virus affecting people in other countries [19]. The virus has certainly undergone mutation. In fact, these mutations likely explain why some epidemics come to an abrupt end as the continued viral alterations may revoke the virulence of the pathogen.",

There is limited data on their accuracy and they are not regulated in the same manner as more standard antibody tests at this time so enthusiasm for these tests need to be tempered. All of these tests will undergo further refinements as we continue to expand our knowledge regarding immunity to COVID-19. We believe that questions regarding who should be screened and what screening should be in place is a pertinent one. Most, if not all, institutions will need to have access to a rapid turnaround test for COVID-19. A point of care test is currently available and should be utilized for emergency cases. Industry has also been able to develop special swabs that can be used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity, eliminating the need for more invasive nasopharyngeal swabs for testing.",

Droplets are expelled during talking and breathing but these usually do not become aerosolized and land on surfaces within a few minutes. Patients undergoing elective arthroplasty should be supplied with a simple surgical mask that will prevent the spread of droplets carrying the virus. Personal protection equipment (PPE) should be available to all the healthcare workers and should focus on masks that are able to filter any pathogen, while allowing for enough comfort to be worn for a substantial length of time.

Anesthesia teams dealing with patients who require general anesthesia and airway management should be fitted with secure personal protection equipment (PPE). As orthopaedic surgeons, we use power tools (drills, saws, etc.) that releases aerosolized material [21] containing blood, bone and fat tissue. The amount of virus particles in these tissues is not known but these instruments could potentially aerosolize virus particles in the operating room. In patients who are positive for the virus, when surgery cannot be delayed, the power settings should be as low as possible, and suction devices should be carefully handled to remove any aerosol formation [22]. This may include suction fitted to electrocautery devices or sterile towels dropped over cutting surfaces to potentially decrease the amount of aerosolized.",

Given that coronaviruses are approximately 0.125 mm (125 um) in diameter [23] high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters might be one possible solution. [24] Thus, filtration of the operating room with devices that intake the air and remove the micro-organisms may be preferable to the positive pressure laminar flow settings.

All reusable material should also be sanitized or sterilized at the conclusion of each procedure. Tests on the proper length of use for each mask and eventual reusing, should be performed to provide evidence-based guidelines to medical staff. Many questions remains: How long we should wear the mask?; How often should we change the masks?; Can the masks be sterilized and safely reused? And many others still remain unanswered.

We have come to understand that SARS-CoV-2 is a robust virus capable of surviving on the surfaces of metal and plastic for up to a few days and is not easily removed by standard air filtration systems [20,27,28]. Thus, another approach to disrupt the chain of pathogen transfer needs to concentrate on the decontamination and sanitization of inanimate and skin surfaces. One agent that has been demonstrated to be viricidal, including activity against coronaviruses, is dilute povidone iodine [[29], [30], [31]]. Dilute povidone iodine was tested against SARS, MERS and Ebola and found to have absolute efficacy. Other agents with potential activity against viruses, as well as bacterial and fungal pathogens, includes hypochlorite and high-concentration alcohol. Thus, it is crucial that all reusable material in the OR, that includes helmets, lead aprons, tourniquets, X-ray machines, navigation consoles, keyboards, screens and robots be sanitized and decontaminated routinely. The current sterilization systems in the hospitals for instruments and trays are effective in eliminating viruses and may not need to be altered. We may, however, need to implement a practice that requires these instruments to be placed in a bath of antiseptic solution during the procedure to prevent potential contamination. We must also be aware that there is a wide variation in the terminal cleaning of the operating rooms across the globe. Effective infection prevention and viricidal protocols need to be implemented in every operating room and arguably in every patient room after discharge.",

While we mourn the loss of lives to this pandemic, society needs to prepare for the eventual lift of social isolation and attempt to return to normalcy. As our knowledge of this pathogen expands and we continue to work towards an effective vaccine and potential treatments for SARS-CoV-2, further strategies for the disruption of the chain of pathogen transfer needs to implemented. We have attempted to highlight some of the changes that arthroplasty surgeons will need to instigate now and when elective arthroplasties are resumed (table 1\n). While SARS-CoV-2 may be a novel pathogen, the actions needed to protect ourselves and our patients against the pathogen are not. The medical community and, more specifically, orthopedic surgeons have been acutely aware of the devastating impact of infections for centuries. We, as a medical community, have always been in the forefront of developing infection prevention protocols and implementing evidence-based strategies to combat these pathogens. Our fight against the COVID-19 will be no different. The ultimate changes that we implement as a result of this pandemic stand to serve our patients and the society well for years to come and help us all safely return to caring for our patients.",
