Recently, concerns have been raised about possible association between ethnicity, incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 arisen from early government data. In this review, we will explore the possible association using both recent COVID-19 studies and studies of previous pandemics. We call for data on ethnicity to be routinely collected by governments, as part of international collaboration, alongside other patient demographics and further research to robustly determine magnitude of association. Moreover, governments must learn from previous pandemics and recommended strategies to mitigate risks on minority ethnicities due to socioeconomic disadvantages.",

It has been found that middle to highincome countries with a universal BCG policy have a lower mortality rate (0.78/million) of COVID-19 compared to those with the same income but without a BCG policy (16.39/million) (18) .
