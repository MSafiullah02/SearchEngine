Genome sequencing allowed to classify the virus into the subgenus Sar-becovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus; it was termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it causes as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, considering the over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries around the world (World Health Organization, 2020). The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Northern Italy was assessed on 7 February, 2020 in a Chinese subject recently returned from Wuhan, but the infection has become epidemic in Northern Italy since February 21, 2020, when autochthonous cases have been identified (Spiteri et al., 2020). At the date of manuscript submission, Italy was the second country with the highest number of SARS-Cov-2-infected subjects after USA (Ministero della Salute, 2020).",

Based on this clinical picture an infection of the upper respiratory tract was postulated making radiographs unnecessary. No suspicion and no specific risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection was formulated, as the virus was not yet spread to Parma province. In order to assess the presence of respiratory bacteria and/or viruses, a nasopharyngeal aspirate, a nasal swab and a pharyngeal swab were sent to the Microbiology and Virology Units of the same hospital. The nasal swab and the pharyngeal swab resulted positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The nasopharyngeal aspirate was tested: (i) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect Respiratory Syncytial virus antigens directly in sample exfoliated cells; (ii) by the same technique after a 24 hour-incubation of inoculated cell monolayers grown on a chamber slide to detect Influenza (A and B), Parainfluenza (1-3), Respiratory Syncytial viruses specific antigens (De Conto et al., 2019) and (iii) by real-time PCR and real-time RT-PCR for the detection of nucleic acids of a large panel of respiratory viruses (Adenovirus, Influenza A virus H1 and H3, Influenza B virus, Parainfluenza virus 1-4, Respiratory Syncytial virus A and B, Metapneumovirus, Bocavirus 1-4, Rhinovirus A, B, C, Enterovirus, Coronavirus 229E, NL63 and OC43) by using the Allplex\u2122 Respiratory Panels assay (Seegene INC., Seoul, Korea). All the above mentioned tests gave negative results. In parallel, the same sample was inoculated in cell monolayers for the detection of cytopathogenic respiratory viral agents (De Conto et al., 2019). Upon daily microscopic observation, a cytopathic effect was detected in VERO and LLC-MK2 cells at day 10 post-infection (Figure 1\nA\u2013D). As a first identification level, electron microscopy of the inoculated cell supernatants after 1% formaldehyde inactivation, ultracentrifugation and negative staining according to standard procedures (Calderaro et al., 2014), enabled the detection of viral particles belonging to the Coronaviridae family (Figure 1E). Subsequently, a real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was performed according to the protocol of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Atlanta, USA, which confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a low cycle threshold (N gene, 15.43 for VERO cell extract; N gene, 15.51 for LLC-MK2 cell extract).",
