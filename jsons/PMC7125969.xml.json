On the other hand, both, the amino and the hydroxy group can easily be transformed to other functional groups. Of special importance is the fact that many of the trifluoromethylated alcohols can be prepared in enantio- and diastereomerically pure from. For that reason, they are promising substances for stereocontrolled reactions. However, their exploration in this part of organic synthesis is limited to a few cases only.
