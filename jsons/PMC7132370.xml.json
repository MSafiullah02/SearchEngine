Sample disasters include the collapse of Sampoong department store in 1995, typhoon Maemi in 2003, the sinking of ferry Sewol in 2014, the outbreak of Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015, Gyeongju earthquakes in 2016, Pohang earthquakes in 2017, Miryang fires in 2018, the chronological outbreak of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease, and others (Ministry of Interior & Safety (MOIS), 2019). Due to the many occurrences of disasters, the people asked the government to take progressive actions, but its policy was incomplete because of many factors, including the lack of disaster awareness, poor level of scientific research, lack of appropriate education, and lack of efficient government efforts.",
