The name \u2018cystatin\u2019 was proposed by Barrett et al. in 1963 and later used to describe homologous proteins in the same superfamily. The first full sequence of a human cystatin was that of cystatin C. There are more than a dozen human cystatins all with different properties, unique distribution patterns, and functions. These have been grouped into four main cystatin types on the basis of DNA and protein sequence homology and over the last few years the superfamily has expanded to include additional CP inhibitors, molecules that have no CP inhibitory activity, and yet others that have evolved functions unrelated to CP inhibition.",

Mammalian type II cystatins all present two disulfide bridges at the C-terminal end of the sequence with 10\u201320 residues between the cysteines. Significant diversity in the type II superfamily members arises from the existence of multigene families encoding many different proteins (Table 1\n) and by polymorphisms affecting the coding sequence and function of the protein. Several diseases are associated with functional deficiencies or aggregation states of certain type II cystatins. The \u2018classical\u2019 type II cystatins C, D, S, SA, and SN are >50% identical at the protein sequence level. In addition, several posttranslational modifications are found in the members of this family. They may also be glycosylated or phosphorylated. Examples of these are cystatins E/M (glycosylated on N108) and cystatins S and SN (consensus phosphorylation sites at S2 and S98, respectively). Cystatin S has been isolated from nasal and bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluids with varying states of phosphorylation, but the significance of this is currently unknown.",

These proteins are of high-molecular mass (60\u2013120 kDa) and present three tandemly repeated type-2 like cystatin domains (D1, D2, and D3) with a total of eight disulfide bridges (six conserved and two additional at the beginning of cystatin domains D2 and D3). The D2 and D3 domains possess CP inhibitory activity similar to the type II cystatins. They are glycosylated proteins but the glycosylation sites are not present in the cystatin domains. Kininogens are expressed intravascularly and are found in blood plasma. However, in addition to their function as CP inhibitors, the kininogens serve as substrates for a diverse group of serine proteinases collectively termed the kininogenases. The kininogenases liberate the kinin family of inflammatory peptides from the parent molecules. The kinins consist primarily of bradykinin (BK) and kallidin (lysyl bradykinin). BK is a nine amino acid peptide released during inflammation and tissue injury that possesses both direct and indirect actions in the airways including bronchoconstriction and bronchodilation, stimulation of cholinergic and sensory nerves, increased mucus secretion, and cough and edema resulting from promotion of microvascular leakage. Its activities are mediated primarily via the B1 and B2 G-protein-coupled receptors.",

The fetuins are N- and O-glycosylated and phoshorylated. The N-terminal region consists of two tandem type II cystatin domains followed by a C-terminal region comprised of a histidine-rich domain between two proline-rich domains. The N- and C-terminal regions are linked by a disulfide bond. \u03b1\n2-HS has a structure similar to HRG except that it lacks the histidine-rich tandem repeat. Unlike the cystatin domains in the kininogens, the fetuins are devoid of CP inhibitor activity and consistent with this, they lack the conserved structural motifs responsible for CP inhibition.

            "text": "The alignment of cystatin sequences has identified three functional regions that have been conserved for more than a billion years of evolution and are responsible for the CP inhibitory activity of the superfamily: a glycine (G) residue in the N-terminal region of the molecule, a glutamine (Q) \u2013 X \u2013 valine (V) \u2013 X \u2013 glycine (G) motif (QXVXG: the \u2018cystatin motif\u2019) in one hairpin loop (see later), and a proline (P) \u2013 tryptophan (W) motif in a second hairpin loop. These regions form a surface on the cystatin molecule that can dock and bind into the enzymatically active site(s) of papain-like CPs. The classic example of a type II cystatin is cystatin C, for which the X-ray crystallographic structure of the chicken protein has been solved (Figure 1\n). The main feature of the structure is a five-stranded \u03b2-sheet wrapped around a five turn \u03b1-helix commonly referred to as the \u2018cystatin fold\u2019. The N-terminal 10 residues are disordered and flexible and the conserved G11 residue is present at the N-terminus of the five turn \u03b1-helix. The QXVXG motif is found on a hairpin loop located between \u03b2-strands B and C and the PW motif on a hairpin loop between \u03b2-strands D and E. Collectively, these three regions form a wedge-shaped edge complementary to the active site of the CP with many side-chain interactions. Each domain interacts with the target proteinase independently and binding of cystatins to CPs may or may not result in conformational changes in either protein. For example, cystatin binding to papain does not induce any conformational change in either protein whereas binding to cathepsin B involves the initial displacement of a loop occluding the active site to allow subsequent tight binding to occur. Cystatins differ considerably in their ability to displace the loop of cathepsin B.",

            "text": "A well-established mechanism for the loss of lung function observed during the progression of emphysema is the enlargement of the pulmonary airspaces due to an imbalance in degradative proteases and their respective inhibitors (see\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE | Emphysema, Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency; CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE | Emphysema, General). The CPs almost certainly contribute either directly or indirectly to this degradation, in particular, lysosomal cathepsins (cat) B, H, K, L, and S (see\nCYSTEINE PROTEASES, CATHEPSINS). Increased concentrations of cat L have been detected in the BAL fluids of patients with emphysema and alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD secrete more CP activity than macrophages from normal smokers or nonsmokers despite the fact that cystatin C concentrations are also increased. Direct inhibition of CP activity by the cystatins (primarily type II) in normal lung tissue likely contributes to the protection of the elastic lung tissue by directly inhibiting these CPs. The cystatins and CPs do not operate independently of other degradative systems (and their respective inhibitors) but participate in feedback systems that can produce profound changes in proteolytic activity referred to as the proteolytic burst (Figure 2\n). For example, several matrix metalloelastases, produced by inflammatory cells or activated airway epithelium, can inactivate AAT. Bronchial epithelial cells secrete procathepsin B and cystatin C, both of which are substrates for neutrophil elastase. Procathepsin B is activated by neutrophil elastase while human cystatin C is inactivated by cleavage between amino acids G11 and G12. The latter observation may explain why active cat L has been found in the BAL fluid of COPD patients despite the presence of elevated cystatin C levels. Cystatin C is also produced by monocytes and macrophages and its release is downregulated by proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), which coincidentally increase the expression of cat B, D, H, L, and S. In addition, cat B, L, and S can inactivate secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI).",

During maturation of APCs in the lymphoid tissue, endosomal cat S activity increases due to a decrease in the levels of cystatin C.
