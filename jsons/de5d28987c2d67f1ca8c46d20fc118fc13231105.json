Because of its high incidence and severity, this is particularly worrisome for stage III disease (that in fact is judged to have a very high priority when triaging patients during the late phase of the pandemic). The global burden of lung cancer is very high (11.6% of all cancers, 2.093.876 cases worldwide in 2018, according to Globocan; https://gco.iarc.fr/today/data/factsheets/cancers/15-Lung-fact-sheet.pdf, accessed April 11, 2020).",
