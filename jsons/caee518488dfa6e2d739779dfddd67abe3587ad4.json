Reports indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to heat and thermal inactivation could efficiently eliminate the coronavirus infectivity. 6 Heat treatment causes RBCs to rupture and form RBC fragments, which may have affected the detection results. Especially in gel microcolumns, falsepositive results are likely. Therefore, the classic test-tube method should be used to instead of blood-type cards to perform bloodgroup typing of the heat-treated samples.
