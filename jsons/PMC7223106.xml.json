            "text": "Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses (LRYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the two most common bariatric operations. The most far-reaching advance in bariatric surgery was the introduction of laparoscopic surgery, with widespread adoption by the mid-1990s [1, 2]. Wittgrove and Clark performed the first laparoscopic gastric bypass in 1993, and by the turn of the century, bariatric surgery became almost exclusively performed using the laparoscopic technique [3]. This has led to decreased length of stay, rare utilization of intensive care units for the standard bariatric operation, and a progression towards enhanced recovery methods [4, 5]. With the implementation of enhanced recovery protocols, surgeons tend to use less invasive methods of perioperative management. This includes decrease in urinary catheterization and the use of nasogastric tubes and abdominal drains (referred to as drains hereafter). Despite the guidelines provided by the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons in 2009, there is still controversy about the routine use of drains and indications for drain placement [6]. As practice patterns change and enhanced recovery protocols are adopted, the use of drains should decrease.",

This database includes patients that underwent metabolic or bariatric surgery and reports 30-day outcomes. The Participant Use Data File (PUF) has been completed and made available for study for the years 2015\u20132017. The use of drains has been evaluated in the database by Doumouras et al. in their seminal article evaluating the PUF for the year 2015 [8]. They showed that the overall drainage rate was 24.4%. They looked at 5 major outcomes: leak, reoperation, morbidity, readmission, and mortality. They found that the use of a drain increased the odds of a leak by 30%. There was also an increase in reoperation, morbidity, and readmission, but there was no difference in mortality. They concluded that routine abdominal drainage should not be used because it \u201cincreased the rate of all-cause morbidity, reoperations, and anastomotic leaks....\u201d Despite this conclusion, we felt that abdominal drainage was not the cause of increased complications and proposed building on this work but including 3 years of MBSAQIP data. We wanted to see if we could find common preoperative characteristics that might have led to drains being placed, operative variables that were associated with drain placement, and differences in postoperative complications in those patients receiving drains. This can be summed up by two questions: what are the characteristics of patients that have drains placed, and what are the outcomes of those patients? Our secondary outcomes of interest were trends in drain utilization in bariatric surgery for the years 2015\u20132017.",

We did not examine the exact type of revisions as this was not one of the main outcomes of this paper but did analyze the cases in the PUF that were listed as revisions. Patients undergoing revisions were more likely to have a routine swallow study (WD 47.8% vs ND 30.6%, p < 0.001), have the anastomosis checked more (WD 85.9% vs ND 69.5%), and had a statistically significant increase in the rates of death, reoperation, and readmission (p < 0.001).",

We found that the significant complications that occurred were consistent throughout the study period despite the decrease in drainage. Routine drainage after LRYGB has been demonstrated as unnecessary. There are multiple reports in the literature that show drainage is not useful for detecting leaks, and some authors recommend abandoning drains altogether. Kavuturu et al. published results of 272 patients with drainage vs 483 patients without and found no benefit in leak detection by routine drainage [14]. Computed tomography was found to be more useful than any other modality for detecting leaks. Regardless of these findings, the overall clinical picture of the patient is paramount to the prompt recognition and treatment of any complication. Rare complications, such as small bowel obstruction, directly caused by drains were also reported in their paper. Those reported results were regarding routine drain placement, but selected usage of drains may be necessary in some cases. Other authors have reached the same conclusions [15, 16]. Our findings support this, but one limitation of the MBSAQIP PUF is that although swallow studies have an option of \u201cno,\u201d \u201cyes routine,\u201d or \u201cyes selective,\u201d the options for drain placement are a \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d choice. If surgeons had the same option for drains, this could clarify what is selection bias for high-risk patients vs drainage that is routinely performed in all cases for that specific surgeon. With data accumulated on 488,000 patients, the question on drainage could be answered definitively.",

This study is limited by its small sample size but adds to the growing body of literature. Albanopoulos et al. also studied drainage in primary and revisional SG.

It only captures data from accredited bariatric centers and therefore may not accurately depict the true incidence of complications in the whole population of bariatric patients. The database is non-randomized, so the comparison is retrospective between cohorts. Also, individual surgeon outcomes are not obtainable from this database, and there is no way to account for the variable results of different accredited centers. This is an especially glaring limitation regarding the questions of drains. We can infer that surgeons left drains in higher-risk patients, but there may be a sizeable percentage of surgeons who routinely leave drains. The strength of this study is the size of this database. It spans 2 countries and collects data on all accredited centers. The data collection process is validated and less subject to bias. The size of our patient population allows some generalizability to the bariatric population at large. We also included emergency cases (n = 2104). This may have skewed our results, but considering that emergency cases only made up 0.43% of the total, it would likely have a small effect.",
