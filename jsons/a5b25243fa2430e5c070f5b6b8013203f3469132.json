The criteria of hospital discharge were: the temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days; the respiratory symptoms improved significantly; the pulmonary imaging showed that the inflammation was obviously absorbed; and the detection of respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid was negative twice in a row (the sampling time is at least 1 day apart). The criteria of CT scan improvement were: exudation or consolidation of the lesion absorbed; the lesion area was gradually narrowed; and there might be residual linear fibrosis.",
