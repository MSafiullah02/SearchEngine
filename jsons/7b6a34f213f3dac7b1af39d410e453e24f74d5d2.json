Acute asthma exacerbations remain a significant cause of morbidity in children and can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function, 1-3 which emphasises the importance of finding an appropriate preventive treatment. Epidemiologic studies have detected viral infections in more than 80% of school children with asthma exacerbations. 4 Of the respiratory viruses known to cause asthma exacerbations, between 60% and 70% are types of human rhinoviruses (HRV). 5,6 Moreover, one recent study showed that HRV was associated with a significantly increased risk of day-to-day asthma symptoms in children. 7 Understanding the role of HRV in acute asthma exacerbations may lead to interventions that will improve asthma management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "HRV is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Enterovirus and the family Picornaviridae.

CDHR3 mutations result in susceptibility to childhood asthma with severe exacerbations.46,47 These findings suggest that CDHR3 is a functional receptor for HRV-C and explain asthma exacerbations are commonly induced by HRV-C. Additionally, different HRV types may have different replications and induce diversified cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to varying illness severity.48 Further study is needed to investigate the mechanism of HRV-A and HRV-C resulting in different illness severities.Through the follow-up among outpatients with asthma exacerbations, HRV persisted for no more than 4 weeks in the nasopharynx, and their symptoms or signs of disease appeared well-controlled. Some authors have reported that HRV infections in infants rarely result in persistence of RNA beyond 30 days.49 Further studies of large samples are required to confirm these findings. Some asthma exacerbation cases may be caused by other respiratory viruses or may present without viral infection at the first visit, while asthma attacks caused by HRV infections may appear again after 4 weeks.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": ", and the Ministry of Education.

The age of inpatients ranged from 17 to 170 months (median, 45 months), and the male to female ratio was 84:59. The age of outpatients ranged from 22Among inpatients, at least one virus was detected in 121 (84.6%) cases. P < 0.001). The detection rate of both total virus and HRV of inpatients was significantly higher than that of the stable asthma group (84.6% vs 16.3%; P < 0.001 and 50.3% vs 2.3%; P < 0.001).
