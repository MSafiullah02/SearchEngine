A marked reduction in the size of the popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) with inoculation of LPS and infection of wild\u2010type mice compared to that only with LPS was observed (Fig 4c), and such a reduction did not occur in mutant mice. However, mutant mice were shown to be refractory to the LPS challenge (Fig. 4c). The possibility that this refractoriness in mutant mice is a result of the poor recognition of LPS is unlikely, because leukocytes derived from mutant mice produced higher levels of some cytokines after stimulation with LPS in vitro than those from wild\u2010type mice (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pin.12159/suppinfo). Elucidation of the mechanism needs further studies, including migration rates of leukocytes into pLN, which might be low in mutant mice after the challenge, because the infected cells in pLN were much fewer (Fig. 3c), counted as less than 25\u201350% compared to those of wild\u2010type mice (Fig. 3c). Many viral antigen\u2010positive cells were mainly detected in the interfollicular area of pLN obtained from infected wild\u2010type mice after inoculation with LPS (Fig. 3i), whereas few viral antigen\u2010positive cells were detected within the LN parenchyma of infected wild\u2010type mice untreated with LPS or mutant mice (Fig. 3g,h).",

This indicates that LeX structures play an inhibitory role in inflammation during the acute phase of infection. The finding that viral titers in mutant mice in the brain and liver after infection were lower than those in wild\u2010type mice might be due to the lower infectivity of cells lacking LeX structures, because the major viral receptor, CEACAM1, carries LeX structures.17 However, in vivo and in vitro examinations revealed that there was no difference in infectivity between wild\u2010type and mutant mice. Therefore, the virological and pathological differences observed in the two strains would more likely result from different immune responses during the initial phase of infection.",

A comparison of cytokine production between the two strains revealed that the amounts in the pons and spleen shifted after infection similarly in the two strains were less than 2\u2010fold in almost every case. Therefore, similar survival rates in spite of different viral growth in the brains after infection in the two strains might be caused by the cytokine production being a bystander effect rather than directly due to the injury of infected cells. Bystander effects represented as an elevation of cytokine levels cause a poor prognosis after brain injuries observed in viral infection, such as influenza viral encephalopathy, which exhibits almost no inflammation nor viral growth in the brain,20 and in other types of brain injury such as stroke.30\n",

In wild\u2010type mice, the inflammatory response against LPS\u2010challenge in the popliteal lymph nodes was tolerated after infection, which did not occur in mutant mice, as far as the size of the lymph nodes was concerned. LPS\u2010tolerance, also known as endotoxin\u2010tolerance, is induced by LPS\u2010challenge accompanied by other immunological treatments, infection, or injury,34, 35 and is caused by inhibitory cascades activated after the recognition of ligands by PRRs,34, 36 which play an important role in immunological homeostasis, suppressing excess immune responses activated through positive cascades triggered by the activation of PRRs.36 The Lex structure might be involved in the negative cascades in the PRR pathway, causing more severe inflammation in the mutant mice after viral infection than in wild\u2010type mice. The possibility that a lack of Lex causes increased inflammatory responses after up\u2010regulation of the positive cascades in the PRR\u2010pathway is unlikely, because mutant mice were refractory to in vivo challenge by LPS. Furthermore, most of the levels of cytokines examined after in vitro stimulation by LPS using leukocytes derived from naive mutant mice were lower or similar compared to those from wild\u2010type mice. However, the production of IFNs was greater in the culture of leukocytes derived from mutant compared to wild\u2010type mice, which excludes the possibility that mutant mice poorly recognize LPS.",
