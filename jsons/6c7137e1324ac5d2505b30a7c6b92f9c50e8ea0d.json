In this study we provide insights and also raise warnings on what is reasonable to expect by applying deep learning to COVID classification of CXR images. We provide a methodological guide and critical reading of an extensive set of statistical results that can be obtained using currently available datasets. In particular, we take the challenge posed by current small size COVID data and show how significant can be the bias introduced by transfer-learning using larger public non-COVID CXR datasets. We also contribute by providing results on a medium size COVID CXR dataset, just collected by one of the major emergency hospitals in Northern Italy during the peak of the COVID pandemic. These novel data allow us to contribute to validate the generalization capacity of preliminary results circulating in the scientific community. Our conclusions shed some light into the possibility to effectively discriminate COVID using CXR.",

In the challenging and never-before seen scenario that rose to attention in the last months, radiologists may look at Artificial Intelligence and deep learning applications as a possible aid for daily activity, in particular for identification of the more subtle findings that could escape the human eye (i.e. reduce false-negative x-rays) or, on the other side, could prompt swab repetition of further diagnostic examinations when first virus testing is negative (considering its sub-optimal sensitivity).",

It is evident that the answer will be given only when publicly available large image datasets will empower scientists to train complex neural models, to provide reproducible and statistically solid results and to contribute to the clinical discussion. Unfortunately, up to date, we are stuck with few labelled images. Thanks to the collaboration with the radiology unit of Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza di Torino (CDSS) hospital in Turin in the last days of March (at the peak of epidemic in Italy), we managed to collect the Covid Radiographic images Data-set for AI (CORDA), currently comprising images from 386 Patients that underwent COVID screening. The data are still limited but, using them to train and test Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as resnet [10] , we contribute to shed some light into the problem. In this work we do not mean to answer whether and how CXR can be used in the early diagnosis of COVID, but to provide a methodological guide and critical reading of the statistical results that can be obtained using currently available datasets and learning mechanisms. Our main contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation of different combinations of usage of existing datasets for pre-training and transfer learning of standard CNN models. Such analysis allows us to raise some warnings on how to build datasets, pre-process data and train deep models for COVID classification of X-ray images. We show that, given the fact that datasets are still small and geographically local, subtle biases in the pre-trained models used for transfer learning can emerge, dramatically impacting on the significance of the performance one achieves.",

            "text": "In the last days a number of preprints targeting covid classification with CNN on radiographic images have begun to circulate thanks to open access archives. Many approaches have been taken to tackle the problem of classifying chest Xray scans to discriminate COVID-positive cases. For example, Sethy et al. compare classification performances obtained between some of the most famous convolutional architectures [17] . In particular, they use a transfer learning-based approach: they take pre-trained deep networks and they use these models to extract features from images. Then, they train a SVM on these \"deep features\" to the COVID classification task. A similar approach is also used by Apostopolous et al.: they pre-train a neural network on a similar task, and then they use the trained convolutional filters to extract features, on top of which a classifier attempts to select COVID features [18] . Narin et al. make use of resnet-based architectures and the recent Inception v3 and then they use a 5-fold cross validation strategy [19] . Finally, Wang et al. propose a new neural network architecture to be trained on the COVID classification task [20] . All of these approaches use a very small dataset, COVID-ChestXRay [21] , consisting of approximately 100 COVID cases considering CXR only. Furthermore, in order to build COVID negative cases, typically data are sampled from other datasets (mostly, from ChestXRay). However, this introduces a potential issue: if any bias is present in the dataset (a label in the corners, a medical device, or other contingent factors like similar age, same sex etc.) the deep model could learn to recognize these dataset biases, instead of focusing on COVIDrelated features. These works present some potential issues to be investigated:",

These few data, then, contain little or even no metadata on age, gender, different pathologies also present in these subjects, and other necessary information necessary to spot on this kind of biases. Besides these, there are other biases we can try to correct. For example, every CXR has its own image windowing parameters or other acquisition settings that a deep model could potentially learn to discriminate. For example, one model may cluster images according to the scan tool used for the exam; if some scan settings correspond to all COVID examples, these will generate a spurious correlation that the model can exploit to yield apparently optimal classification accuracy. Another example is given by textual labeling in images: if all the negative examples are sampled from the same dataset, the deep model could learn to recognize such feature instead of focusing on the lung content etc. \u2022 Very small test sets: as a further consequence of having very little data, test set sizes are extremely small and they do not provide any statistical certainty on learning.",

The proposed pre-processing chain is summarized in Fig. 1 and is based on the following steps: factors, typically depending on subject contrast, receptor contrast or other factors like scatter radiations [26] . Hence, the raw acquisition has to be filtered through Value Of Interest transformation. However, due to different calibrations, different range dynamics can be covered, and this potentially is a bias. Histogram equalization is a simple mean to guarantee quite uniform image dynamic in the data. \u2022 Lung segmentation: the lung segmentation problem has been already faced and successfully tackled [27] - [29] . Being able to segment the lungs only, discarding all the rest of the CXRs, potentially prunes away possible bias sources, like for example the presence of medical devices (typically correlated to sick patients), various text which might be embed in the scan etc. In order to address this task, we train a U-Net [30] on Montgomery County Xray Set and Shenzhen Hospital X-ray Set. The lung masks obtained are then blurred to avoid sharp edges using a 3 pixel radius.

Of course, its initialization on a similar task helps in the training process, but in any case a fine-tuning is still necessary [31] . \u2022 Proper sizing of the encoder to-be-used is an issue to be addressed. Despite many recent works use deeper architectures to extract features on the COVID classification task, larger models are prone to over-fit data. Considering the minimal amount of data available, the choice of the appropriate deep network complexity significantly affects the performance. \u2022 Balancing the training data is yet another extremely important issue to be considered. Unbalanced data favor biases in the learning process. Such balancing issue can be addressed in a number of ways: the most common and simple way to solve this issue is adding or removing data from the training-set. Removing data from a tiny dataset is not a viable approach; considering that the COVID datasets are built mainly of positive cases, one solution is to augment them with negative cases from publiclyavailable datasets. However, this is a very delicate operation and needs to be done very carefully: if all the negative cases are made of non-pathological patients, the deep model will not necessarily learn COVID features. It may simply discriminate between healthy and unhealthy lung. Providing a good variety of conditions in the negative data is not an easy task. The choice of the images may turn to be critical and, just like in the pre-training phase, one can include unwanted biases: again the model can end up classifying new images (that are positive to covid) exploiting discriminative biases present in different datasets. \u2022 Testing with different data than those used at training time is also fundamental. Excluding from the test-set exams taken from patients already present in the training-set is important to correctly evaluate the performance and to exclude the deep model has not learned a \"patient's lung shape\" feature. \u2022 Of course many other issues have to be taken into account at training time, like the use of a validation-set to tune the hyper-parameters, using a good regularization policy etc. but these very general issues have been exhaustively discussed in many other works [32] - [34] .",

Given the large availability of public data for pneumonia classification (for example, in this scope we used ChestXRay and RSNA), it could be a good move to pre-train the encoder, and effectively this is what we observe looking at Table II. For example, if we focus on the results obtained training on the CORDA dataset, without a pre-trained encoder, BA and DOR are lower than pre-training with ChestXRay or RSNA. Despite the sensitivity remains very similar, pre-training the encoder helps in improving the specificity: on the test-set extracted from CORDA, using a pre-trained encoder on RSNA, the specificity is 0.80, while it is only 0.58 with no pre-trained feature extractor. Similar improvements in the specificity can be observed also on test-sets extracted from all the other datasets, except for ChestXRay. In general, a similar behavior can be observed when comparing results for differently pretrained encoders trained on the same dataset. Pre-training is important; however, we can not just \"freeze\" the encoder on the pre-trained values. Since the encoder is pretrained on a similar, but different task, there is no warranty the desired output features are optimal for the given classification task, and a fine-tuning step is typically required [36] .",

While RSNA is a more generic pneumoniasegmentation dataset, ChestXRay contains information also about the type of pneumonia (bacterial or viral); so, at a first glance it looks a better fit for the pre-training. However, if we look at training on the CORDA dataset, we see that for the same sensitivity value, we get typically higher specificity scores for RSNA pre-training. This is not the same we observe when we compare results on the publicly-available COVID-ChestXRay: in this case, sensitivity and specificity are higher when we pre-train on ChestXRay. Looking at the same pretrained encoder, let us say ChestXRay, we can compare results training on CORDA and on COVID-ChestXRay, which are the two COVID datasets: CORDA shows a lower sensitivity, but in general a higher specificity, except for the ChestXRay dataset. Having very little data at training time, pre-training introduces some priors in the choice of the features to be used, and depending on the final classification task, performance changes, yielding very good metric in some cases. Pre-training on more general datasets, like RSNA, in general looks a slightly better choice than using a more specific dataset like ChestXRay. ",

A general trend can be observed for many COVID-augmented training-sets: the BA and DOR scores measured on the testset built from the same dataset used at training time are typically very high. Let us focus on the ChestXRay pretrained encoder. When we train on CORDA&ChestXRay, the BA score measured on the test-set from the same dataset is 0.9 and the DOR is 122.67. However, its generalization capability for a different composition of the test-set, let us say, CORDA&RSNA, is way lower: the BA is 0.56 and the DOR 2.26 only. The same scenario can be observed when we train on CORDA&RSNA: on its test-set the BA is 0.90 and DOR 122.64, while on the test-set of CORDA&ChestXRay the BA is 0.59 and DOR 2.47. The key to understand these results lies again in the specificity score: this score is extremely high for the test-set of the same dataset the training is performed on (for example, for CORDA&RSNA is 0.95 and for CORDA&ChestXRay is 0.94) while for the others is extremely low. Such a behavior is due to the presence of some common features in all the data belonging to the same augmenting dataset. This can be observed, for example, in Fig. 3a , where the extracted features from an encoder pretrained on ChestXRay and trained on CORDA&ChestXRay are clustered using t-SNE [37] (blue and orange dots represent ChestXray and CORDA data samples respectively, regardless of the COVID label). It can be noted that CORDA samples, regardless the COVID+ or COVID-label, are clearly separable from ChestXRay data. Of course, all ChestXRay images have COVID-label, so someone could argue that the COVID feature has been captured. Unfortunately we have a counterexample: in Fig. 3b we compare CORDA vs. RSNA samples, using the same ChestXRay pre-trained encoder and now RSNA and CORDA samples no longer form clear clusters. Hence, the deep model specializes not in recognizing COVID features, but in learning the common features in the same dataset used at training time. We would like to remark that for all the data used at training or at test time, all the pre-processing presented in Sec. III-B has been used. We ran the same experiments without that pre-processing and performance on different datasets than the one used at training time gets even worse. For example, ",

The hope is that a deeper network could extract more representative features for the classification task. Given the discussion in Sec. IV-A, we show only the cases with pre-training of the feature extractor. Using this deeper architecture, we can observe that all the discussions made for ResNet-18 still holds. In some cases performance impairs slightly: for example, the DOR score on CORDA&ChestXRay for ResNet-18 was 122.67 while for ResNet-50 drops to 73.35. This is a sign of over-fitting: given the very small quantity of data currently available, using a small convolutional neural network is sufficient and safer. Taking an opposite approach, we tried to use a smaller artificial neural network, made of 8 convolutional layers and a final fully-connected layer, which takes inspiration from the ALL-CNN-C architecture [38] . We call this architecture Conv8. The results on this smaller architecture are similar to those observed in Table II . For example, training the model on CORDA dataset, on Conv8 we have a BA of 0.61 and DOR of 2.38 while for ResNet-18 with encoder pre-trained on RSNA we have BA of 0.67 and DOR 4.78. We can conclude that using a smaller architecture than ResNet-18 does not give relevant training advantages, while by using larger architectures we might over-fit data.",

IV we compare the classification metrics obtained with COVID-Net and our ResNet-18 model: both models have been trained using COVID-ChestXRay, and tested on both CORDA and COVID-ChestXRay. In line with the discussion above we can note that both COVID-Net and ResNet-18 yields surprising results when the same dataset is used for traning and testing: The performance of COVID-Net on the COVID-ChestXRay testset (the same dataset used at training time) is very high (BA of 0.85 and DOR of 36.0) while it drops significantly when tested on CORDA, where BA is 0.55 only and DOR is 6.68. This drop is explained looking at sensitivity and specificity: it is evident that the model classifies as COVID-almost all the data. A similar behavior can be observed also in ResNet-18 model: the observed performance apparently looks incredible (since that the BA on the test-set is 1.0), and in fact similar numbers are also claimed in the other works on ResNetlike architectures [17] - [19] . However, testing on CORDA reveals that the deep model is likely to have learned some hidden biases in COVID-ChestXRay and tends to mis-classify COVID-samples as COVID+ (given that the specificity is here 0.20).",

Some recent works highlighted the possibility of successfully tackle this problem, despite the currently small quantity of publicly available data. In this work we have highlighted possible obstacles in successfully training a deep model, ranging from the proper choice of the architecture to-be-trained to handling removable biases in medical datasets. Extensive experiments show that extracting a \"COVID\" feature from CXR is not an easy task. Such a problem should be addressed very carefully: it is very easy to misinterpret very good results on test-data, still showing poor generalization on new data in the same domain. We could perform such a test thanks to the possibility of using CORDA, a larger dataset comprising COVID cases. Of course, the quantity of available data is still limited but allowed us to find some promising seminal classification results. The ongoing collection and sharing of large amount of CXR data is the only way to further investigate if promising CNN results can aid in the fight to COVID pandemic.",

Dealing with generality of the results is a very delicate matter: what it is possible to see in Tab. II is that augmenting data with COVID-data needs to be very thoughtful since the classification performance may vary from very high accuracy down to almost useless discriminative power. Nonetheless, training using only COVID datasets yields some promising scores: for example, using ChestXRay pre-trained encoder and CORDA for training and testing, the BA we achieve is 0.56 and the DOR is 1.64. Including also COVID-ChestXRay for training (which consists in having more COVID+ and COVIDexamples) improves the BA to 0.62 and the DOR to 2.93. In this case, however, the specificity is an issue, since we lack of COVID-data. However, these results show some promise that can be confirmed only by collecting large amount of data in the next months.",
