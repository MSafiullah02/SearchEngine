For example, the aquabirnaviruses are classified as a separate genus in the family Birnaviridae and are distinguished from the other genera by serological and host range parameters. The novirhabdoviruses, containing certain members of the fish rhabdoviruses, are distinguished by a unique viral gene located between the glycoprotein and polymerase gene. No other rhabdovirus contains such a gene encoding a nonvirion protein.

For aquaculture, as with care of other food animals, the disease control measures must be cost-effective, practical and easy to administer in the field. Avoidance continues to be the most effective and economical control measure for the fish pathogens described here. Presently, strict certification of eggs and fry as specific pathogen-free is required for the shipment of eggs and fish between states and countries. Outbreaks are controlled by the destruction of all eggs and fish at the facility that might be contaminated with virus. Stocks of specific pathogen-free eggs or fish are reared in noncontaminated water (well water). Vaccines have been developed for several of the fish pathogens, and include attenuated vaccines, killed vaccines, DNA vaccines and subunit vaccines prepared by recombinant DNA technology. The vaccines have varying degrees of efficacy, but none are presently licensed and commercially available.",

The virus has been reported from the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, the UK, Japan, Norway and Chile. Hosts include cyclostomes, elasmobranchs and 14 families of marine or anadromous fish. Chum, pink, coho and chinook salmon and steelhead trout are all susceptible. Older inapparent carrier fish are assumed to be the reservoirs of infection for young fish. Infection of fish has been demonstrated by intraperitoneal and water-borne transmission studies. In addition, transmission of virus infection from herring to salmon under experimental conditions indicates a marine source of virus in aquaculture. To date this virus has never been successfully grown in cell culture.",

Infected erythrocytes can be readily identified by appearance and are more easily lysed than normal cells. Infected fish are more susceptible to secondary bacterial infection and environmental stresses. Blood smears show inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes. Giemsa-stained smears display inclusions that are acidophilic, 1\u20135 nm in diameter, and intracytoplasmic. Infected erythrocytes show nuclear degeneration, margination of chromatin, pyknosis, karyorhexis and karyolysis. An increased number of immature erythrocytes occurs in peripheral blood, and hematocrit values are depressed. In addition, blood from fish with VEN clots abnormally slowly or not at all. Two types of inclusion bodies have been identified from herring erythrocytes by electron microscopy. One type is associated with virions and is coarsely granular, round and electron dense. The other type of inclusion body is membrane bound with few, if any, virions. The primary diagnostic tool is stained blood smears, with definitive diagnosis by the examination of particles by electron microscopy.",
