With an estimated 15\u00b75% attributable fraction of all deaths in children under 5 years of age, pneumonia is believed to be responsible for the deaths of around 900,000 children every year [1, 2]. The main burden remains disproportionately concentrated in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where pneumonia is one of the most frequent triggers of health facility consultation, and one of the most common causes of hospitalization, representing a huge load for the overburdened and fragile health care systems [3].",

Various interventions have shown to be effective to prevent and treat childhood pneumonia, including exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, prevention of childhood malnutrition, childhood immunization, reduction of household air pollution, hand washing, and use of simple and standardized guidelines [5\u20137]. Although substantial progress has been achieved, the toll of preventable deaths related to pneumonia remains intolerably heavy. Better implementation of the strategies shown to be effective to prevent and treat childhood pneumonia seems crucial to further reduce the burden of pneumonia. Once implemented, adequate national surveillance systems are required to evaluate their progress towards the reduction of the disease burden. To this end, it is imperative to collect reliable local data to determine the burden of the disease, the main pathogens involved, risk factors contributing to the disease, and to describe epidemiological trends. However, reliable local data are often scarce or entirely missing in LMIC, where the main burden of pneumonia remains concentrated, leading to challenges when it comes to evaluating the preventive strategies implemented [8].",

Health workers were trained across the country and the coverage of IMCI implementation reached 100% in all the districts of the country by 2011 [16]. The strategy promotes the early recognition of different syndromes (including pneumonia) in under-five children, as well as a simple and algorithm-based systematic approach for their management. Despite these efforts, acute respiratory infections (ARI) seem to remain a major public health challenge in Bhutan, whereby they were estimated to represent the fifth cause of mortality for the whole population, and to cause 15% of deaths in under-five children [12, 17]. The conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine is routinely administered since 2011 and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was recently introduced in the childhood immunization schedule (January 2019) [18, 19]. Reduction of risk factors, immunisation, and case management are the main approaches to disease control [3].",

A prospective hospital-based study, (unpublished observations) (see Additional file 1: Appendix 3). The medical thesis focuses on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in children admitted at the national referral hospital (JDWNRH), while all the other studies describe community acquired infections. Eight studies focused on Bhutan, while two manuscripts presented data on LRI in 195 countries including Bhutan [6, 23]. Nine out of the 10 studies were published in the last 8 years; the remaining one was published in 1995 [24]. Only two studies [24, 25] focused on children, all other studies included all age groups.",

Over the last 10 years, the RCDC initiated an influenza surveillance system among outpatients and hospitalized patients, comprising Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). This clinical and laboratory-based surveillance is carried out at 11 hospitals that were selected as sentinel sites. Each sentinel site collects random samples from few ILI cases every week, and samples from every SARI case [27]. This system works as epidemiological and virological surveillance, with the aim of monitoring the burden and trends in respiratory diseases, as well as monitoring the epidemiology of influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens [28, 29]. Data are reported on a weekly basis and feedbacks are shared on the RCDC website every week and in quarterly bulletins [15, 28, 30]. Evaluation of the SARI surveillance platform by Thapa et al. in 2015 and 2016 identified significant underreporting of SARI cases, consequently questioning the national data ensuing from this surveillance system [31].",

If the proportion of the vaccinated population is over 80%, which is likely to be the case in Bhutan, the indirect effect of the vaccine to the unvaccinated population, known as herd protection, could prevent 12 and 10 deaths for PCV13 and PCV10 respectively. Authors concluded that both PCVs would be cost-effective in Bhutan, thus recommending their inclusion in the immunization programme. This has recently been approved by the Bhutanese government, with PCV13 being introduced into the routine vaccination programme in January 2019.

However, there is no robust and comprehensive data in Bhutan describing this illness. Indeed, we did not identify data that would provide a thorough understanding on the aetiology of ARI in Bhutanese children, nor help us characterize this syndrome better.

Up to now, identification of RSV, HMPV, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses is attempted only for samples negative for influenza virus. However, targeted screening leads to underreporting of other pathogens, and failure to adequately describe or identify mixed viral infections, commonly occurring in ARI [37, 38]. This issue has been detected and testing all viruses will soon be performed in all the collected samples independently of influenza identification (personal communication).

However, no studies were found describing in detail the viral aetiology of ARI in children, in spite of the importance that viruses are known to play in the aetiology of ARI in this age group. Additionally, data on the bacterial aetiology of ARI in Bhutan are also very limited, coming from studies with very low sample sizes [34], from a study on nosocomial VAP, or from limited hospital-based microbiological surveillance efforts. We did not find any study describing other important causative pathogens of respiratory infections in children such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. We also did not find any study looking at other causes of LRI-like syndrome in children, such as bronchitis, which would fall under the terminology of pneumonia as defined by the WHO. Some of these admissions could be due to non-infectious causes such as hyperreactive airways and contribute to the burden of what is overall classified under the broader umbrella of ARI. Altogether, there are considerable knowledge gaps regarding the aetiology of ARI in Bhutanese children that need to be addressed in a well conducted prospective aetiological study, as a better understanding of the causes of this deadly syndrome, which is crucial for better and more tailored management and preventive strategies. Moreover, comprehensive local data on resistance patterns of causative agents is also needed to effectively design antibiotic management and prevent the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.",
