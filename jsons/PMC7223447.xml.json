            "text": "Inflammasomes are oligomeric multiprotein complexes that function as pattern recognition receptors to trigger the initiation of the inflammasome cascade. The core subunit is typically comprised of procaspase 1 (the ultimate effector protein that initiates inflammation) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), which functions as an adaptor protein between procaspase 1 and a variety of sensor proteins that recognize molecular pattern motifs (Rathinam et al. 2016). Activation of the inflammasome plays a crucial role in a variety of pathophysiological responses when exposed to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Petrilli et al. 2007). Of particular interest is sensing of DAMPs and PAMPs through the nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeat, pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis) and life-threatening pathogenic infections, including the Gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, causative agent of human tularemia (Atianand et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Sensing of DAMPs or PAMPs results in the formation of the multimeric inflammasome complex and autoproteolysis of procaspase 1. Active caspase 1 cleaves interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) from their precursor forms to the active form (Thornberry et al. ; Martinon et al. 2002; Agostini et al. 2004). The release of active IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 subsequently trigger the expression of other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, etc (Henry and Monack 2007; Mariathasan et al. 2005; Weiss et al. 2007). This response, however, must be tightly controlled as its dysregulation can result in the pathological cytokine storm (Tisoncik et al. 2012). In the case of F. tularensis infection, excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production has been shown to progress into edema, hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and, if left untreated, death (Mares et al. 2008; Sharma et al. 2011). Mice deficient in inflammasome activation are more resistant to F. tularensis infection (Mariathasan et al. 2005; Periasamy et al. 2016). Moreover, mice deficient in both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, products of inflammasome activation, are more susceptible to F. tularensis infection compared with the wild type mice. Conversely, mice deficient in only one of these products are protected (Collazo et al. 2006). Therefore, suppression but not ablation of inflammasome function seems to be a promising approach for preventing the overactivation of the inflammatory cytokine storm during F. tularensis infection.",

            "text": "Given the central role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in this and other pathological and pathophysiological processes, there is a profound interest in the development of small molecules with NLRP3 inhibitory activity. Glyburide, a drug used in the treatment of type-2 diabetes was shown to display NLRP3 inhibitory activity at high millimolar concentrations (Lamkanfi et al. 2009). In addition, MCC950, a sulfonylurea-based compound, showed promising activity in animal models of multiple sclerosis (Coll et al. 2015). Polyphenolic compounds such as curcumin (Yin et al. 2018), resveratrol (Chang et al. 2015), isoliquiritigenin (Honda et al. 2014), have been identified as NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors. Small molecules that form covalent interactions with NLRP3 inflammasome are also reported. However, the structure of neither the NLRP3 inflammasome nor its individual component proteins has been determined. This lack of structural details has proven to be a major impediment in the rational design of small molecule inhibitors capable of specifically inhibiting the uncontrolled inflammasome activation. In this article, we report the synthesis of rationally-designed small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors using computational chemistry and pharmacophore modeling. The cyclic, tertiary sulfonylurea compounds were geometry optimized at the Hartree\u2013Fock level of theory using the 6\u201331 G(d) basis set using Spartan \u201916 molecular modeling software (Pro 2018). The pharmacophoric regions were aligned using curcumin derivatives as the lead molecule. These novel rationally-designed inflammasome inhibitors were screened in vitro against Francisella tularensis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

The fact that curcumin has a number of biological effects has labeled curcumin as a Pan-assay interference compound (PAINS), but this does not preclude this natural product as a scaffold for drug development (Capuzzi et al. 2017). Most recently, curcumin was shown to bind to dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (Banerjee et al. 2018). Also, curcumin and the chalcone derivative isoliquiritigenin are known inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Curcumin, however, has a low plasma half-life because of its facile degradation via a retro-aldol pathway (Anand et al. 2007). It also metabolized into pharmacologically inactive glucuronide metabolite. Thus, chemical and enzymatic instability of this natural product, present some serious challenges from the drug discovery perspective.",

The sulfonyl group both in terms of electrostatics and length was a reasonable mimic for the region B of chalcone and the enol form of curcumin. Our computational studies described below indicate that diaromatic sulfonylurea structures can adopt conformations that place the aromatic rings in similar positions in 3D space.

Note the proximity of the pharmacophoric carbonyl oxygen electron density with the sulfonyl oxygen electron density. The pharmacophore model has the two aromatic rings of the sulfonylureas occupying essentially the same 3D space as chalcone.

Despite the production of IL-1\u03b2 as the direct result of inflammasome activation, we found that the downstream production of IL-6 in response to concomitant inflammasome activation and TLR-mediated signaling to be a more sensitive measure of the inhibition of inflammation. Because IL-1\u03b2 is the originating signal priming immune cells to respond by inducing inflammation, small changes in IL-1\u03b2 can result in large changes in inflammation. As a result of these small changes in IL-1\u03b2, it is difficult to observe differences between potential inhibitors. Since the production of IL-6 results from an amplification of the inflammatory signal, these differences are augmented and much more easily observed. It is critical, however, to confirm that IL-1\u03b2 production is directly suppressed by these inhibitors since we observed that compound 5 inhibited IL-6 production but not IL-1\u03b2 production in human cells. This suggests that compound 5 may actually inhibit TLR-mediated signaling rather than the inflammasome signaling. Further experimentation along these lines may identify the proteins directly suppressed by compound 5. Surprisingly, IL-1\u03b2 production was consistently inhibited more strongly in murine macrophages compared with human macrophages. Though unexplained, this may suggest a differential reliance on IL-1\u03b2-mediated triggering of inflammation or an as yet incomplete picture of the NLRP3 inflammasome structure.",
