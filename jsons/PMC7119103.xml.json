            "text": "The penetration of animal viruses into cells is the result of an active process of specific interactions with cell surface macromolecules. Differentiated organisms do not express identical sets of surface macromolecules on different cell types, tissues, and organs. This basic feature of organisms results in a compartmentalization of susceptibilities to infection by viruses. As observed repeatedly in nature, different viruses infect distinct target cells in one or a group of host species. This is the expected evolutionary outcome of a population equilibrium between organisms and their parasites that must have been favored by mutual long-term interactions. Although permissivity of virus entry into cells is by no means the only determinant of host cell tropism, it is certainly an important element with implications in viral pathogenesis. Changes in the specificity of virus entry into cells may be of consequence also for viral disease emergence and disease prevention and control.",

            "text": "Early reports (reviewed in McLaren et al., 1959) suggested the presence of receptors for bacteriophage in Escherichia coli cells and for influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and enteroviruses in some animal cells. The studies of McLaren, Holland, and their colleagues with poliovirus (Holland 1961, Holland 1959, McLaren 1959) indicated that the productive adsorption of poliovirus was associated with specific antigenic structures possessed only by susceptible primate cells (or subcellular cell debris). We term viral receptor any cell surface macromolecule involved in the recognition of the cell by a virus or in the penetration of a virus into the cell. For simplification, we do not establish a difference between receptor and coreceptor (Young, 2001) because such a distinction is at times ambiguous, and it is not essential to the main aims of the present review. However, we maintain the term coreceptor when referring to some of the molecules that participate in retrovirus entry, as in this case the term is amply employed in the literature. The problems addressed in this review are in the interphase between virus evolution and cell recognition by viruses. Topics include changes in receptor usage, shared use of the same receptors by different viruses, and coevolution of antigenicity and host cell tropism. We then review briefly some of the implications of flexibility in receptor usage for the host range of viruses, for the emergence of viral diseases, and consequences for the use of viruses as vectors for gene delivery. In this regard, we discuss the possible involvement of viruses as agents of lateral gene transfer during the evolution of cellular life on earth as a means to accelerate functional diversification of cells and cell collectivities. In none of theses topics can we (or intend to) be exhaustive. Selected examples are used to unveil the implications of the highly dynamic nature of viral genomes for modifications of receptor specificity, particularly for those viruses with RNA as genetic material. Recent introductions to the mechanisms of virus entry into cells can be found in general virology textbooks (Cann 2001, Flint 2000). Among excellent reviews on viral receptors are those published by Wimmer 1994, Weiss 1995, Miller 1996, Hunter 1997, Evans 1998, Sommerfelt 1999, Berger 1999, Nemerow 2000, Schneider-Schaulies 2000, Skehel 2000, Rossmann 2000, Rossmann 2002, Spear 2000, Speck 2000, Dragic 2001, Young 2001, Eckert 2001, Shukla 2001, Goldsmith 2002, Hogle 2002, Kunz 2002, Bomsel 2003.",

            "text": "The genetic complexity of viruses, as reflected in the size of their genome, varies from a few thousand nucleotides in the case of RNA viruses (the genome of bacteriophage MS2 is 3569 nucleotides long, and that of the largest coronaviruses comprises about 32,000 nucleotides) to a broader range in the case of DNA viruses (the double-stranded DNA of hepatitis B virus has about 3200 bp, whereas the large poxviruses, iridoviruses, and herpesviruses have DNA of 130,000 up to 370,000 bp). Genome complexity appears to influence the strategies of the interactions between viruses and cells. Hosts must have evolved defense mechanisms to limit virus replication at the expense of their cells, and in turn, viruses must have evolved mechanisms to counteract cell responses (at least to survive to be an object of interest for a review article). The most complex DNA viruses encode a number of proteins that may or may not have a cellular homologue and that may modulate host defense responses. Classical examples are the glycoprotein C of herpes simplex virus, which blocks complement activation, or proteins E3\u29f819K and E1a of adenovirus, which suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules that are required for the T-cell recognition of infected cells. Other viral proteins are homologues of cytokines, chemokines, or their receptors or may induce or inhibit apoptosis. An increasing number of viral-coded, immunomodulating proteins is being discovered, some with seemingly redundant functions, and others with multiple effects on cells, playing active roles as determinants of virus survival and pathogenesis (reviews in Alcami 2000, Alcami 2003, Seet 2003, Xu 2001). Host-interfering proteins may also be expressed by RNA viruses (HIV-1 nef, RNA silencing suppressor B2 in flock house virus, several interferon antagonists such as NS1 of human influenza virus A, etc.), albeit their number appears to be more limited than for complex DNA viruses. This probably reflects two fundamentally different viral strategies to cope with host defenses: interaction versus evasion.",

Compressing mechanisms include the presence of overlapping reading frames; ambisense RNA; common leader RNA sequences for the synthesis of subgenomic messenger RNAs; untranslated regions, which include signals for RNA replication and protein synthesis; cis-acting regulatory elements within open reading frames; RNA editing; partial read-through of termination codons, leading to two forms of a protein that differ in a carboxy-terminal extension; leaky ribosome scanning with initiation of protein synthesis occurring at two in-frame AUGs, leading to two forms of a protein that differ by an amino-terminal extension; ribosome hopping, shunting, and bypassing; ribosome frameshifting, resulting in a change of the order of triplet reading to yield a single fused polypeptide from two overlapping open reading frames; and synthesis of a polyprotein, which is then cleaved to produce functional intermediates and fully processed proteins, with processing intermediates and processed proteins having distinct functional roles in interaction with viral RNA, viral proteins, or cellular proteins. In addition, many viral proteins appear to be multifunctional, thereby expanding the role of a single nucleotide stretch in the completion of a virus replication cycle (reviews in Flint 2000, Knipe 2001, Semler 2002). Genome compactness imposes a conflict between the requirement of genetic variation to permit adaptation to changing environments and the need to maintain infectivity in genomes in which virtually every single nucleotide appears to be involved in some structural or functional role. Genetic variation to escape from selective constraints is generally reflected in the survival of subpopulations of genomes that may show little alteration in replication capacity (fitness) or, despite a reduction of fitness, may still replicate to generate new mutant distributions of higher fitness.",

            "text": "The tolerance of viral genomes (or other replicons) to accept mutations decreases with genome complexity (Domingo 2001, Eigen 1988). RNA viruses display mutation rates and frequencies in the range of 10\u22123 to 10\u22125 errors per nucleotide copied (Batschelet 1976, Drake 1999), values that imply the continuous generation of dynamic mutant distributions in a replicating RNA virus population. These high mutation rates in RNA genomes would be incompatible with maintenance of the genetic information contained in large viral or cellular DNA genomes (Eigen and Biebricher, 1988). This evolutionary adaptation of mutation rates is mirrored in the biochemical activities of the relevant DNA and RNA polymerases. Cellular DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication generally contain a 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 exonuclease proofreading\u2013repair activity capable of excising misincorporated nucleotides to allow incorporation of the correct complementary nucleotide prior to further elongation of the nascent DNA chain. Such a proofreading\u2013repair activity is absent in viral RNA replicases and reverse transcriptases, as evidenced by both structural and biochemical studies (Men\u00e9ndez-Arias 2002, Steinhauer 1992). Furthermore, a number of postreplicative repair pathways are active on double-stranded DNA but cannot act on RNA, therefore contributing to a final 105- to 106-fold higher average copying fidelity during cellular DNA replication than during RNA genome replication (Domingo 2001, Drake 1999, Friedberg 1995, Goodman 1998).",

            "text": "Viruses exploit the same mechanisms of genetic variation as cells: mutation, homologous and nonhomologous recombination, and genome segment reassortment in the case of viruses with segmented genomes. Different virus families vary in the extent of utilization of these different variation mechanisms. For example, homologous recombination is very active in positive-strand RNA viruses and retroviruses, but appears to be rare in negative-strand RNA viruses. Because of general high mutation rates, RNA virus populations consist of complex mutant distributions termed viral quasispecies (Domingo 2001, Eigen 1996, Eigen 1988, Eigen 1979, Nowak 1992). Quasispecies was formulated as a general theory of molecular evolution by M. Eigen and colleagues to describe self-organization and adaptation of simple early replicons that could occur at early stages of the development of life (Eigen 1988, Eigen 1979). Although the initial quasispecies theory involved mutant distributions in equilibrium, extensions of the theory to finite replicon populations subjected to environmental changes have been developed (Eigen 2000, Wilke 2001). Therefore, the quasispecies theory was instrumental in understanding the population structure and dynamics of RNA virus populations. Virologists use an extended definition of quasispecies to signify dynamic distributions of nonidentical but closely related mutant and recombinant viral genomes subjected to a continuous process of genetic variation, competition, and selection, and which act as a unit of selection (Domingo, 1999). It must be stressed that because of high mutation rates (Batschelet 1976, Drake 1999), each individual genome in a replicating population, which includes a number of distinctive mutations, has only a fleeting existence because new mutations are arising continuously, even in a single infected cell. Thus, an RNA virus genome population may be defined statistically but it is essentially indeterminate at the level of individual genomes (Domingo 2001, Domingo 1978). Mutant swarms are subjected unavoidably to competition, and those mutant distributions best adapted to replicate in a given environment are those that dominate the population at a given time. Unfit mutant distributions are subjected to negative selection and kept at low (sometimes undetectable) levels in the population. Unfit mutant distributions in one environment may nevertheless be fit in a different environment, and a modulation of frequencies of genome subpopulations is the key to adaptability of RNA viruses. The biological relevance of the quasispecies nature of RNA viruses stems from the fact that mutant spectra may contain genomes with altered biological properties, including modified cell recognition capacity. Relevant parameters are the number of mutations per genome, genome length, and viral population size, as documented with several virus systems both in cell culture and in vivo (Table I\n).",

            "text": "Diversification of viruses within infected organisms, even when it involves limited genetic change, is of consequence for viral pathogenesis and persistence. This is because one or a few mutations may suffice to change important biological properties of viruses (such as host cell tropism, resistance to antibodies, to cytotoxic T lymphocytes or to inhibitors, among other traits; Table I). Small numbers of mutations in components of mutant spectra are easily attainable by diversifying populations of viruses during acute or chronic infections. Even when a mutation that confers a phenotypic change results in a modest fitness decrease, compensatory mutations can have an opportunity to rescue genomes with normal or nearly normal fitness values (Cassady 2002, Escarm\u00eds 1999, Escarm\u00eds 2002, L\u00e1zaro 2002, Liang 1998, Nijhuis 1999, Wang 1996, Yuan 2000). Viral fitness determined ex vivo may be a relevent indicator of disease progression in vivo (Ball et al., 2003). Within-host variation is the first step in the process of long-term diversification of viruses in successions of transmission events from infected to susceptible hosts. Comparison of consensus nucleotide sequences of independent isolates of the same virus originated from a single source of infection allows a calculation of the rate of evolution. As expected from the complex quasispecies dynamics, rates of evolution for RNA viruses are not constant with time (a \u201cclock\u201d does not operate) and are often in the range of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124 substitutions per nucleotide and year. These values can also vary for different genomic segments of the same virus. In sharp contrast, rates of evolution for cellular genes have been estimated in 10\u22128 to 10\u22129 substitutions per nucleotide and year. Interestingly, DNA viruses, even those with small genome size, display widely different rates of evolution. As an example, such rates have been estimated in 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per nucleotide and year for canine parvovirus and in the range of 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 to 3 \u00d7 10\u22128 substitutions per nucleotide and year for some papovaviruses (reviewed in Domingo et al., 2001).",

Such procedures have confirmed the extensive diversity of extant viruses; it has not been possible to derive a genetic tree that relates the known viruses, not even DNA or RNA viruses separately. This, together with the disparate replication strategies exhibited by viruses, suggests multiple origins for the viruses we study today: viruses are polyphyletic. For viruses that infect distantly related host species, such as the herpesviruses, a parallelism between host phylogeny and virus phylogeny has been observed (McGeoch and Davison, 1999). This suggests a host\u2013virus cospeciation, implying deep evolutionary roots of viruses with their hosts (Gorbalenya 1995, McGeoch 1999) (discussed further in Section V,D).",

Considering that each \u201cindividual\u201d RNA virus circulates as a dynamic quasispecies, the diversity of viral genomes on earth is astonishing. Each replication-competent component of a quasispecies distribution can, in principle, initiate a virus diversification process to generate a spectrum of genotypes and phenotypes.

            "text": "Some viruses apparently use only a single receptor to infect their target cells, whereas others are able to exploit several alternative receptors to initiate their replication in different cell lines or even to enter the same cell type (Table III). Evidence shows that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) may employ integrins \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, and \u03b1v\u03b26 as receptors. Recognition of these integrins is dependent on an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) triplet found in the surface G-H loop of capsid protein VP1, and this triplet is very conserved among natural isolates of the seven FMDV serotypes (Domingo 1990, Domingo 1992, Mateu 1995). However, several studies suggest the use of alternative receptors by FMDV, both in cell culture and in vivo. Upon adaptation of FMDV to cell culture, mutations may occur that result in the acquisition of positively charged amino acids at key residues of the capsid surface that allow FMDV to enter cells via heparan sulfate (HS) and possibly other receptors (Baranowski 1998, Baranowski 2000, Escarmis 1998, Fry 1999, Jackson 1996, Sa-Carvalho 1997, Sevilla 1998, Zhao 2003). Following this seminal observation with FMDV, studies with other viruses have demonstrated that passage in cell culture results in evolutionary changes that allow the viruses to use HS for cell entry. Examples include Sindbis virus adapted to BHK cells (Klimstra et al., 1998), classical swine fever virus propagated in swine kidney cells (Hulst et al., 2000), and variants of human rhinovirus 89 adapted to HEp2 cells (Reischl 2001, Vlasak 2002) (Section II,B).",

Almost all strains described to date require interactions with two molecules on the cell surface. One of them acts as an attachment receptor, with which viral glycoprotein gp120 interacts. This interaction promotes conformational changes that expose the fusogenic peptide of gp41, which, in turn interacts with the fusion receptor. This is essential for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes and therefore allows the viral capsid to enter the host cell. The group of cellular molecules involved in lentivirus fusion are referred to as coreceptors. It has been suggested that those strains shown to use only the fusion receptor have already undergone, at least partially, the conformational changes normally induced by the attachment receptor (Berger et al., 1999).",

The preferential use of some attachment receptors over others is thought to be influenced by their relative abundance on the cell surface. Thus, on macrophages, CD4 is scarce and HIV attachment takes place mainly through HS proteoglycans, especially syndecans (Saphire et al., 2001). It has been reported that integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is involved in the infection of macrophages that have differentiated in vitro (Lafrenie et al., 2002); certainly, the significance of this interaction in vivo deserves further study. HIV infection of colon epithelia in vivo is CD4\u2013independent and is believed to take place through GalCer (Bhat 1993, Fantini 1993). Neuronal cells and intestinal epithelia are rarely infected in vivo, but binding of HIV envelope glycoproteins to GalCer contributes to the selection of CCR5-binding variants following vertical transmission (Meng et al., 2002). This GalCer-mediated selection may also contribute to pathogenesis, e.g., in the gastrointestinal disorders associated with HIV infection and in neuronal dysfunction in AIDS dementia. HIV populations that acquired the capacity to bind CD8 and replicate in CD8+ T cells have been recovered from a patient at a late stage of the infection (Saha et al., 2001). A wide variety of molecules from different structural and functional families can act as fusion receptors (or coreceptors). The most important is the chemokine receptor superfamily, for many of its members can bind HIV and\u29f8or SIV. A related protein is a \u03b2-chemokine receptor US28, encoded by human cytomegalovirus (Pleskoff et al., 1997). There are also other coreceptors, such as the leukotriene B4 receptor (BLTR) (which has structural homology with chemokine receptors) (Owman et al., 1998) and an orphan receptor of the central nervous system (APJ). Usually, most HIV strains evolve in vivo from using mainly CCR5 (R5 viruses) to using mainly CXCR4 (X4 viruses), but many other coreceptors can be used simultaneously.",

Rotaviruses are important viral agents of acute gastroenteritis in young children and in many animal species. Rotavirus strains differ in their requirement of sialic acid for initial binding to the cell surface: a minority of animal rotaviruses require the presence of sialic acid residues on the cell surface for efficient binding and infectivity (Arias 2001, Zarate 2000), but most animal and human rotaviruses do not. However, binding to sialic acid is not an essential step for rotavirus infection, as confirmed by the isolation of sialic-independent variants from a sialic-dependent strain (Mendez et al., 1993). The existence of a postattachment cell receptor common to most, if not all, rotavirus strains has been proposed. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 blocks the infectivity, although not the binding, of the sialic acid-dependent rhesus rotavirus (RRV), its sialic acid-independent mutant nar3, and the sialic acid-independent human rotavirus strain WA, suggesting that \u03b1v\u03b23 interacts with both neuraminidase-sensitive and neuraminidase-resistant rotaviruses at a postbinding, probably penetration, step (Guerrero et al., 2000). Other integrins, such as \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b14\u03b21, and \u03b1x\u03b22, have also been reported to play a role in rotavirus entry (Ciarlet 2002, Coulson 1997, Hewish 2000, Londrigan 2000).",

The initial contact of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), the prototype of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, with cells is usually the binding of virus to HS proteoglycans (Shieh 1992, Shukla 2001, WuDunn 1989), mediated by glycoprotein gC and, to a lesser extent, by gB. Then, glycoprotein gD can interact with at least three different classes of molecules that can act as entry mediators for HSV-1. These molecules include HveA (which belongs to the family of tumor necrosis receptor proteins), nectin-1 (HveC) and nectin-2 (HveB) (two members of the immunoglobulin superfamily), and 3-O-sulfated HS (reviewed in Spear 2000, Shukla 2001). The binding of gD to one of these different receptors initiates fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane. The related Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), a transforming virus of the gammaherpesvirinae subfamily, displays a marked B-cell lymphotropism associated with the expression of receptor CD21 (or CR2). EBV has been associated with a number of human proliferative diseases, including B-cells lymphomas, a clinical condition encountered in immunocompromised hosts (Krance et al., 1999). However, EBV can replicate in differentiated epithelial cells that do not express CD21, suggesting that other receptors may be involved in EBV infections (reviewed in Schneider-Schaulies, 2000).",

Interaction of adenovirus with \u03b1v integrins has been reviewed (Nemerow 1999, Nemerow 2000) (Table II). A variety of bacterial pathogens also use integrin receptors to either adhere to or enter into host cells. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a gram-negative enteropathogen, which infects cells of the gut wall via binding to \u03b21 integrins (Isberg and Leong, 1990), and Yersinia enterocolitica uses integrins to bind to cells of the intestinal ephitelium. The interaction of Yersinia with host surface integrins induces activation of the cytoskeleton and the rearrangement of actin into pseudopods that engulf the bacteria (Krukonis and Isberg, 1997). A number of microbial pathogens, including B. pertussis, Coxiella burnetti, E. coli, Histoplasma capsulatum, Legionella pneumophila, Leishmania spp., and Rhodococcus equi, make use of integrins \u03b1M\u03b22 and \u03b1x\u03b22, also known as complement receptors (CR3 and CR4), to enter the macrophage and avoid the host microbicidal oxidative burst (Aderem 1999, Capo 1999, Krukonis 1997; see review of cell entry mechanisms by diverse pathogens in Mims et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The specific interactions between a viral protein or glycoprotein and receptor molecules are amenable to structural studies, and such studies are providing essential new information for the understanding of virus\u2013receptor interactions. Enveloped viruses, such as HIV, attach to host cells by means of spike-like membrane glycoproteins, whereas most nonenveloped viruses, such as picornaviruses, attach by means of specialized domains integral to their capsids. Some viruses cannot be assigned to one of the two binding modes. For example, adenoviruses are nonenveloped particles, but have trimeric fibers projecting from the vertices of their icosahedral capsid, which terminate in a globular knob domain responsible for the specific interactions with the cellular receptors (Nemerow, 2000). The interaction of the surface hemagglutinin of human influenza virus with N-acetylneuraminic acid and the conformational alterations associated with the pH-dependent membrane fusion stand as one of the best characterized virus entry processes at both functional and structural levels. The entry of human influenza virus into human cells has been reviewed (Skehel and Wiley, 2000) and is not treated here except as an illustration of some concepts in following sections. Viral receptor-binding sites typically comprise highly conserved amino acid residues (Rossmann et al., 1985), a requirement that appears to guarantee survival of the virus. Early crystallographic studies of picornaviruses indicated that these and other viruses may shield their receptor-binding sites in cavities or surface depressions (\u201ccanyons\u201d) that are inaccessible to antibody molecules, and this inaccessibility would confer viruses a selective advantage (Rossmann et al., 1985). Subsequent studies with other viruses have shown that receptor-binding sites may also occur in highly exposed regions of the viral surface (He 2002, Hewat 2000, Verdaguer 1995). It may be predicted that when receptor-binding sites and neutralizing antibody-binding sites overlap at the virus surface, amino acid replacements needed for antibody escape may be deleterious as they affect receptor recognition. However, in line with the dynamics of RNA virus populations (Section II,B), this conflict is just one of the several instances in which negative selection may act to maintain variants at low levels and to rescue fit viruses through compensatory mutations. There is no strict requirement that surface residues involved in receptor recognition be entirely shielded from immune attack. Another proposed mechanism to compensate for possible adverse effects of amino acid replacements regarding cell recognition is provided by the water buffer hypothesis, discussed at the end of this section.",

However, the orientation of the receptor molecules is different for each virus\u2013receptor complex (Fig. 1). The orientation of domain D1 is approximately radial in all cases except for poliovirus. The canyon of poliovirus is wider than that of CBVs and HRVs, allowing the tangential binding of PVR into the PV canyon (Belnap 2000, He 2000, Xing 2000). Therefore, the shape and size of the canyon may be important factors that dictate the docking orientation of the receptors. Receptor binding to major group HRVs and enteroviruses is localized within the canyon, at a site adjacent to a hydrophobic pocket within the VP1 \u03b2 barrel containing an as yet unidentified \u201cpocket factor.\u201d Kinetic analyses of the virus\u2013receptor interaction have shown for both HRVs (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995) and polioviruses (McDermott et al., 2000) that there are two distinct modes of binding whose relative abundance varies with temperature.

The footprint of V1-3 includes only residues of VP1. Close to the receptor attachment site is the virus-neutralizing immunogenic site A, located within the BC loop of VP1. Because the receptor-binding site of HRV2 is on a protruding domain of the capsid, it is not hidden from immune surveillance. It is remarkable that the receptor-binding site of major group HRVs is very similar to that of enteroviruses, which belong to a different genus, but is essentially different from that of minor group HRVs, which belong to the same genus. Minor group HRVs, which do not bind ICAM-1, are not obviously phylogenetically or structurally distinct from major group HRVs. Furthermore, HRV14, a major group serotype, is more distantly related to another major group serotype, HRV16, than to the minor group representative HRV2. Nevertheless, the residues of HRV2 corresponding to the ICAM-1 footprint on HRV14 or HRV16 lack the charge complementarity observed for major group HRVs (Kolatkar 1999, Verdaguer 2000). In addition, receptors of major group HRVs and enteroviruses both cause virus destabilization, unlike the receptor of minor group HRVs. This is an example of the adaptability to different receptors and the variety of receptor-binding sites exhibited by members of the picornavirus family. A comparison of receptor interactions and entry pathways of different picornaviruses suggests that those receptors that bind into canyons or pits of the capsid induce partial capsid destabilization through displacement of the \u201cpocket factor,\u201d which contributes to capsid stability. This type of receptor-mediated destabilization occurs in poliovirus, some coxsackieviruses, and the major group rhinoviruses, which utilize molecules of the Ig superfamily as receptors. In contrast, those receptor molecules that do not bind into the canyon often do not contribute to virus destabilization and may condition the nature of subsequent steps in the entry process (a destabilizing, acid-mediated step in endosomes, etc.). Examples include the binding of VLDV receptor to the five-fold axis region of the minor group of HRV-2, echovirus 7 binding to DAF and FMDV binding to integrins or other receptor molecules (Table III). It has been suggested that viruses that do not use molecules of the Ig superfamily as receptors may be more variable at receptor recognition sites, facilitating shifts in receptor usage, with consequences for virus pathogenesis (Rossmann et al., 2002).",

The distal ends of the spikes are believed to contain the receptor-binding sites, as neutralizing antibodies that bind near the distal ends inhibit viral penetration (Prasad et al., 1990). Cryo-EM and three-dimensional reconstructions have been valuable tools for identifying putative receptor-binding sites on the E2 glycoproteins of two alphaviruses, Sindbis virus and Ross River virus (Smith et al., 1995). This strategy has also facilitated the examination of a highly mobile, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing antigenic loop on the adenovirus 2 and 12 particles (Stewart 1997, Chiu 1999) and on the picornavirus FMDV capsid (Hewat 1997, Verdaguer 1999), which harbor integrin-binding sites (Fig. 2\n).",

The crystal structure revealed that the heparin molecule makes ionic interactions with the viral residues using two sulfates (GlcN-2-2-N-SO3 and GlcN-4-6-O-SO3). Amino acid Arg-56 in VP3 plays a central role in organizing the sulfate groups, making interactions with both. Further polar residues that belong to all three major capsid proteins play a subsidiary role in heparin binding via bridging water molecules. The nonionic interactions observed include van der Waals stacking contact among, His-195 of VP1, the central L-iduronic acid (Idu) ring, and the apolar patch of GlcN-4. The virus surface remained essentially unchanged to accommodate the sugar, suggesting that the shape complementarity may contribute to receptor specificity.",

These structures revealed that the receptor-binding faces are surface loops exposed to immune selective pressure. Both viruses bury a similar amount of surface area to create an atypical virus\u2013receptor interface because of the presence of a shape mismatch in the surface topography that creates large cavities or channels. The lack of van der Waals interactions between the two protein surfaces may be partially compensated by the presence of solvent molecules filling the cavities. These water molecules would act as a bridge mediating hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms of the viral protein and the receptor. The viral residues in contact with this water-filled cavity show important sequence variability, whereas surrounding this patch are highly conserved residues, the substitution of which may affect receptor binding. Thus, the observed interfacial cavities may serve a dual purpose as a water buffer between the viral protein and the receptor, and as molecular glue through the establishment of hydrogen bonds between backbone and conserved atoms. The tolerance for variation in the surface of the protein associated with this cavity produces a variational island, which is centrally located between regions required for receptor binding and may help the virus escape from antibodies. By using a noncomplementary interface that traps water molecules, the virus can maintain its receptor specificity while altering its amino acid sequence. This type of interface observed in two very different viruses such as HIV and adenovirus supports the water buffer hypothesis as a new general mechanism by which viruses can complete the first stage of infection successfully. The trapping of water molecules may allow receptor recognition to be less influenced by amino acid substitutions at the relevant sites of the virus surface, minimizing the adverse effects of high mutational pressure (Section II,B) on an essential step in the virus life cycle.",

            "text": "There are several cases of minimal changes in viral genomes that result in the alteration of receptor specificity or affinity (Baranowski et al., 2001). Early studies with influenza virus identified key residues of virus hemagglutinin (HA) that confer specificity for sialic acid linked to galactose by either an \u03b1-2,3 or an \u03b1-2,6 linkage. Human H3 influenza viruses bind preferentially to sialic acid linked to galactose by an \u03b1-2,6 linkage, whereas avian and equine viruses show a preference for the \u03b1-2,3 linkage (Matrosovich 1997, Rogers 1983). Human H1 and H2 viruses, as well as swine H1 viruses, also show preferentially a specificity for Neu5-Ac\u03b1-2,3Gal. It was established that a single substitution in the 226 position of the HA changed the receptor specificity, which suggests that HAs that differ in the recognition of one sialic acid or another differ in amino acid 226 (Rogers et al., 1983a). Further studies indicated that two mutations in residues 226 and 228 of a human HA allowed replication in ducks. The mutations resulted in a receptor-binding site sequence identical to the known avian influenza virus sequences (Naeve et al., 1984). Other studies on receptor specificity in human, avian, and equine H2 and H3 influenza virus isolates showed that residues 226 and 228 are leucine and serine in human isolates and are glutamine and glycine in avian and equine isolates (Connor et al., 1994), confirming the key role of these two residues in determining the receptor specificity of influenza viruses.",

Single replacements (Val-160 to Ile in VP1 or Met-62 to Ile in VP4) allow the primate-restricted P1\u29f8Mahoney strain of poliovirus to paralyze mice (Colston and Racaniello, 1995). The mutation in VP4 may render the virus accessible to a molecule that acts as a virus receptor and which is located on the surface of neurons of the mouse spinal cord. This molecule does not seem to be expressed in the mouse brain (Jia et al., 1999). A mutant of encephalomyocarditis virus termed variant D is usually asymptomatic for rodents, but it can induce diabetes in mice through the destruction of pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The diabetogenic variant includes amino acid replacement Thr-776 to Ala along the capsid pit, likely affecting receptor interaction and cell tropism (Bae and Yoon, 1993). Important determinants of tropism and pathogenesis of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) have been mapped at various positions on capsid protein VP1, including positions adjacent to the putative virus receptor-binding site. TMEV mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions at these particular VP1 positions displayed altered neurovirulence in susceptible mice and produced only mild symptoms during the acute phase of the infection or were highly attenuated regarding the development of chronic demyelinating disease (Jnaoui 2002, Lin 1998, McCright 1999, Wada 1994). Amino acid residues flanking the RGD integrin-binding motif of FMDV have been shown to influence the selectivity of integrin binding (Jackson 2000a, Jackson 2002).",

            "text": "Research on the Edmonston vaccine strain of measles virus (MV) led to the identification of CD46 (a group of determinants whose function is to protect cells from complement-mediated lysis) as a receptor for this virus. Transgenic mice expressing CD46 may show typical pathogenic manifestations of the virus (Oldstone et al., 1999). Marmosets lacking CD46 were susceptible to several isolates of MV, but not to the Edmonston vaccine strain. Some natural isolates of MV do not enter cells through CD46, instead they use the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM or CDW150), a glycoprotein expressed on some types of B and T lymphocytes, as a receptor (Hsu 2001, Tatsuo 2000a, Tatsuo 2000b). Although wild-type MV interacts with SLAM with high affinity, it can also interact with CD46 with low affinity (Masse et al., 2002). A single amino acid replacement in the surface hemagglutinin of the MV envelope determines the ability of the virus to bind CD46 with high affinity (Hsu et al., 1998). Additional receptors may be involved in MV infection (Hashimoto 2002, Oldstone 2002). Despite its relative antigenic stability, it has been estimated that MV mutates at an average rate of 9 \u00d7 10\u22125 substitutions per base copied (Schrag et al., 1999). Therefore, point mutations of the type that led to binding of CD46 should occur frequently during MV replication.",

In vivo, the change to using the CXCR4 coreceptor was also linked to a number of mutations that implied an acquisition of positive charges and loss of a N-glycosylation site, modifications that clustered between amino acids 190 and 204 og gp160. In other cases, substitutions to nonbasic amino acids at position 440 of gp160 were also linked to the R5 or X4 phenotypes (Hoffman et al., 2002). Furthermore, changes that confer a highly basic character (on loop V3) allow the virus to also use glycosaminoglycans as attachment factors for cell entry, which results in a 10-fold increase in viral production in cell culture (Zhang et al., 2002).",

A change of cell tropism in cell culture was associated with replacement Glu-407 to Lys (Verschoor et al., 1995). Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells were transfected with an FIV molecular clone that was unable to infect them. However, high-dose DNA transfection resulted in the recovery of an FIV mutant capable of replicating in these cells. A single point mutation in the SU protein was responsible for this change in viral tropism (Vahlenkamp et al., 1997). In another study, a variant of FIV emerged after the passage of wild-type virus in cell culture. The variant displayed a phenotype markedly different from that of the parental virus, including the capacity to productively infect previously refractory cell lines and the induction of large syncytia. This phenotype could be attributed to the combination of two amino acid substitutions (Gln-224 to Pro, Thr-470 to Pro) in glycoprotein SU and to a premature stop codon that resulted in a truncated transmembrane protein (Lerner and Elder, 2000).",

Modifications of the host range of parvoviruses have been associated with amino acid substitutions on the viral capsid (Parrish and Truyen, 1999). Binding affinity to the transferrin receptor correlated only partially with the host range displayed by the virus (Hueffer et al., 2003). Remarkable changes in adenovirus (Ad) host cell tropism can be observed upon minimal alterations of virus fiber sequences. Amino acid substitution Glu-240 to Lys in the distal domain of Ad19p fiber conferred binding to human conjunctival cells, whereas the reverse substitution abrogated cell binding when introduced into the phylogenetically distant Ad37 (Huang et al., 1999). The presence of a Lys residue at position 240 of the adenovirus fiber was associated with an outbreak of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.",

Although wild-type HSV-1 strains can enter cells via HveA (but not via human nectin-2), Rid mutants, which differ from the wild type by an amino acid substitution at position 25 or 27 of gD, can use human nectin-2 (but not human HveA). Studies with the swine alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PrV) further documented the important potential of herpesviruses to explore alternative mechanisms of cell recognition (Nixdorf 1999, Schmidt 2001, Schmidt 1997). Although glycoprotein gD is critically involved in PrV entry into susceptible cells, the expression of gD is not required for direct viral cell to cell spread and PrV mutants deleted in the gD gene can be propagated in MDBK cells by cocultivating infected and noninfected cells. While infectivity was found to be strictly cell associated in early passages, repeated passaging resulted in the appearance of infectivity in the supernatant, reaching titers as high as 107 PFU\u29f8ml. Mutations in viral glycoproteins gB and gH were found to correlate with the capacity of PrV to interact with alternative receptors and the development of a gD-independent mode of entry.",

The weight of single nucleotide substitutions in the phenotype of RNA viruses must be considered in relation to the additional three parameters indicated in Table I (number of mutations per genome, virus population size, and genome length). The fact that a single replacement can have profound biological consequences for an RNA virus was one of the triggers of interest in quasispecies (review of early observations in Domingo et al., 1985). To what extent complex DNA viruses may incorporate mutations at some genomic sites involved in cell recognition, with the flexibility of RNA viruses, is largely unknown. Because of several implications for the biology and uses of DNA viruses (discussed in Section V), this problem certainly deserves further investigation (compare with Section II,B).",

The parental clone C-S8c1 enters BHK-21 cells via an RGD-dependent integrin, as documented by both inhibition of cell entry by synthetic peptides and site-directed mutagenesis of an infectious cDNA clone to modify the RGD (Baranowski et al., 2000). Passage of FMDV C-S8c1 in BHK-21 cells resulted in the dominance of viruses with several amino acid replacements on the capsid surface (Fig. 3\n). These replacements resulted in an expansion of host cell tropism in cell culture, with the acquired capacity to infect a number of primate and human cell lines, a capacity that was absent in the parental C-S8c1 (Baranowski 2000, Ru\u00edz-Jarabo 2003). As expected, some of the amino acid replacements conferred to the multiply passaged virus the capacity to bind heparin. However, these viruses did not need to use HS as a receptor, as mutants deficient in heparin binding (that were selected from the multiply passaged quasispecies) were equally infectious in cell culture (Baranowski et al., 2000). Therefore, a third entry pathway, which is independent of HS and of RGD-dependent integrins, must have been acquired by FMDV C-S8c1 upon repeated passage in BHK-21 cells. The selective changes underlying such cell recognition conversion are not known (Baranowski 2000, Baranowski 2001).",

Therefore, when HS binding was impaired, the virus used the RGD-dependent pathway for cell entry.

Variants of FMDV harboring replacements within the RGD or at some neighboring positions documented to be critical for integrin binding have been isolated in vivo. One of the relevant experiments involved vaccination of 138 cattle with synthetic peptides representing B-cell and T-cell epitopes of FMDV C3 ARg-85 (Taboga 1997, Tami 2003). The animals were protected only partially as a result of the immune response to the synthetic peptide constructs and, upon challenge with virulent FMDV C3 Arg-85, several of them developed viremia and vesicular lesions. Virus from several lesions included amino acid substitutions within the RGD or at neighboring positions (Fig. 4\n). It is not clear whether such variant viruses would be able to reinitiate infection of cattle and, if they did, whether they would be stable through the completion of infectious cycles in vivo. Passage of FMDV O\u29f8CHN\u29f890 (a type O FMDV used for vaccine production in China) in BHK-21 cells resulted in viruses that displayed altered tropism. Cell culture adaptation of the Cathay prototype foot-and-mouth disease virus from China results in altered tissue culture host range and pathogenic phenotype in pigs (Zhao et al., 2003). This altered virus caused mild disease in swine. Despite this evidence for flexibility in receptor usage, variants of FMDV selected to bind heparan sulfate were attenuated in cattle (Sa-Carvalho et al., 1997). This and other observations suggest that RGD-dependent integrins may be a major class of receptors employed by FMDV in vivo (Neff et al., 1998), although the flexibility of the virus to modify receptor usage in vivo is an open question.",

Some of the variants had different biological properties, expected from the tissues from which they were isolated. One type of variant predominated in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas another type was dominant in lymphocytes and macrophages. Most CNS isolates caused acute infection when injected intravenously into immunocompetent adult mice. These variants evoked a potent immune response and infection was cleared with the active participation of anti-LCMV CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In contrast, most LCMV variants from lymphocytes and macrophages evoked a generalized immunosupression in the animals. Interestingly, these critically different phenotypes of LCMV relate to alterations in the affinity for \u03b1-dystroglycan, a receptor for LCMV, lassa fever, and clade C new world arenaviruses (Cao 1998, Spiropoulou 2002). A single amino acid substitution in the glycoprotein GP1 of LCMV alters its affinity for \u03b1-dystroglycan; high-affinity binding is associated with immunosupression and viral persistence in mice, whereas low-affinity binding results in clearence of infection (Cao 1998, Sevilla 2000, Sevilla 2002, Smelt 2001).",

            "text": "HIV-1 coreceptor usage changes during infection in humans. Most primary isolates belong to the coreceptor specificity R5, but as infection progresses, dualtropic (R5X4) and X4 variants arise and often become dominant (Section III,A). The emergence of X4 HIV-1 strains in infected individuals has been associated with an increase in pathogenic manifestations and development of AIDS. Evolution of coreceptor usage (R5, multitropic, X4) seems to be the rule with HIV-1 subtypes A, B, D, and E during progressive disease. Subtype C apparently does not follow this trend in that the great majority of isolates obtained at different geographic sites are R5 monotropic regardless of the severity of the HIV infection (Fen\u00ffo, 2001). There are variants proven to be able to use other coreceptors as well, such as CCR2b, CCR3, CCR8, BOB, Bonzo, US28, and BLTR (B4 leukotriene receptor), but their relevance for HIV infection in vivo is not clear (Fen\u00ffo, 2001). The host range of HIV-2 in human cells is similar to that of HIV-1, yet differences exist in the use of coreceptors. Primary isolates of HIV-2 use CCR5, but they may simultaneously use a wide variety of other coreceptors, such as CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, and BOB (Table III), despite the main coreceptor being CCR5. Variants that can use CXCR4 become dominant at late stages of the infection (Morner et al., 1999). Multitropic HIV-2 and SIV strains can infect CD4-negative cells (Liu et al., 2000). SIVsm is closer phylogenetically to HIV-2 than to HIV-1 and behaves similarly in several ways. As HIV-2, SIVsm can use a wide variety of different coreceptors, such as CCR3, CCR5, CXCR4, BOB, and Bonzo. They are multitropic, and several isolates can infect CD4-negative cells (this is also true for a small number of HIV-1 strains). Coreceptor usage, in contrast to what it is observed with HIV-1, narrows with time, and as the infection progresses, HIV-2 isolates tend to use only coreceptor CXCR4, and SIV only CCR5 (Vodros et al., 2001).",

It does not cause acute disease and is restricted to grow on feline cells. The receptor for this group of viruses has not been isolated. FeLV-Bs evolve from FeLV-A by recombination with endogenous FeLV-like (enFeLV) envelope sequences, which results in a change to Pit1 receptor specificity. Pit1 is a classic multiple membrane-spanning receptor molecule. Recombinant forms of FeLV-B differ in the amount of envelope surface unit (SU) that is derived from enFeLV, and this may affect whether the virus can also use Pit2 (which has 62% structural identity with Pit1) as a receptor (Anderson 2001, Sommerfelt 1999, Sugai 2001, Tailor 1999b). Viruses that use Pit1 and Pit2 as receptors use the latter with lower efficiency (Boomer et al., 1997). FeLV-C and -T evolve by mutation of FeLV-A. In contrast to group A, groups B, C, and T FeLVs show an expanded host range, which includes infection of human cells (Sommerfelt 1999, Sugai 2001). FeLV-C viruses use a protein called feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR), and the use of this receptor is associated with amino acid replacements within the 15 to 20 amino acids of the first variable region (V1) of SU. FeLV-C strains differ from FeLV-A in a Lys-to-Arg substitution in V1, but additional substitutions in SU must be involved in the use of FLVCR and the expanded host range (Brojatsch 1992, Sommerfelt 1999). FeLV-T (a T-cell tropic feline leukemia virus) is the first naturally occurring type C retrovirus that cannot infect cells unless both Pit1 and a second coreceptor or entry factor are present. This second receptor component, called FeLIX, is a cellular protein that is closely related to a portion of the FeLV envelope protein. This cellular protein can function either as a transmembrane protein or as a soluble component to facilitate infection (Anderson 2000, Lauring 2001). The most important feature to confer T-cell tropism seems to be an insertion of four to six amino acids in the C-terminal portion of SU, although additional amino acids could also be involved in this phenotype.",

HIV infections, with their erosive effects on the immune system, offer a relevant case. Adaptation of HIV to a changing cellular environment could contribute to the selection of variants with different cell tropism and different pathogenicity (Viscidi, 1999). This can be regarded as a positive selection directed by the immune system, resulting in modifications of host cell tropism of HIV (Crandall, 1999). For example, in the late stages of HIV infection, CD4+ cells are depleted, and variants that use CD8 to enter CD8+ cells arise (Saha et al., 2001). Thus, subpopulations of cells involved in the human immune response, whose abundance may be modified by HIV-1 infection, may in turn become a key selective force for HIV evolution (Crandall, 1999).",

Individuals whose peripheral blood lymphocytes produce high levels of CCR5 ligands (such as RANTES, MIP1\u03b1, and MIP1\u03b2) are relatively resistant to infection (Garzino-Demo 1998, Paxton 1996, Zagury 1998). Selection by receptor ligands is also supported by experiments using a mouse model in which a modified form of RANTES, a natural ligand for CCR5, selected HIV mutants that used CXCR4 as a coreceptor (Mosier et al., 1999). Also, AMD3100, a bicyclam that is a selective antagonist of CXCR4, led to the complete suppression of X4 variants in cell culture and prevented the switch from the less pathogenic R5 HIV to the more pathogenic X4 strains (Este et al., 1999).",

Likewise, the host cell selected an avian retrovirus variant with an expanded host range, consisting of recognition of a receptor on chicken cells and a distinct receptor on quail cells (Taplitz and Coffin, 1997). This evidence must make virologists aware that when they isolate a virus from a biological specimen by passage in an established cell line, a virus with different biological properties (cell tropism or other) than the natural virus may be selected. Variants of LCMV with profoundly different biological properties have been isolated from different organs of infected mice (Section IV,B), emphasizing the impact of quasispecies dynamics during infections in vivo (Sevilla et al., 2002). In most cases summarized in this section, the precise nature of the selective force that acts to perturb mutant distribution is not well understood in molecular terms. In many other cases, even the types of selective constraints that mediate changes in host cell tropism are not obvious. This is perhaps one of the areas of research in evolutionary virology that necessitates efforts because of the multiple implications of variations of host cell tropism for the control of viral disease. Model experiments in cultured cells (that attempt to match the type of cells found in vivo), with the aim of relating variations in the nucleotide sequence (and in the corresponding structure of encoded proteins) with alteration in cell recognition, may provide information on the molecular basis for tropism specificity and tropism changes.",

A change in receptor specificity could involve a modification in binding to antibodies or vice versa. Furthermore, an antigenic domain that coincides with a receptor-binding site may lose constraints for variation once a different receptor that interacts with other capsid residues becomes operational.

Because the RGD triplet located at the surface G-H loop of capsid protein VP1 is a key part of several epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies (Mateu 1995, Verdaguer 1995), dispensability of the RGD integrin-binding motif for cell entry expanded the repertoire of antigenic variants of FMDV greatly and prompted the isolation of viable antibody-escape mutants with profoundly altered antigenicity that contained mutations at the RGD triplet (Martinez 1997, Ruiz-Jarabo 1999). Mutants with RED, RGG, and even GGG instead of RGD were isolated. Viable viruses were obtained when the relevant mutations were engineered in an infectious clone with the sequence context of the capsid of the multiply passaged C-S8cl; RNA transcripts did not give rise to variable virus when the same mutations were engineered in the sequence context of the parental clone C-S8cl (Baranowski et al., 2000). Studies with FMDV containing RGG showed impaired reactivity with monoclonal antibodies specific for the relevant antigenic sites and with polyclonal antibodies raised in swine and guinea pigs using the wild-type virus as immunogen (Ruiz-Jarabo et al., 1999).",

The antigenic alterations produced by replacements at or around the RGD suggest that the emergence of these particular FMDV mutants in vivo was the result of selection of antigenic variants that escaped neutralization by anti-FMDV antibodies in peptide-vaccinated cattle (Fig. 4). A study analyzing the genetic changes selected during the adaptation of FMDV to guinea pig documented the progressive dominance of an unusual amino acid replacement (Leu-147 to Pro) affecting the antigenic structure of the G-H loop of capsid protein VP1 in the course of adaptation of FMDV to this new host (N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 2001). Construction of infectious cDNA clones of FMDV confirmed that this Leu-147 was essential for virus interaction with integrin receptor molecules expressed in BHK cells and various other cell lines used commonly to propagate FMDV and that mutants with Pro-147 do not form plaques on BHK-21 cells (N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 2001). The isolation of FMDV mutants displaying altered cell tropism in association with antigenic changes illustrates the important adaptive potential of FMDV and the capacity of this virus to explore new antigenic\u29f8receptor recognition structures upon replication in its hosts.",

The discovery that chemokine receptors act as cofactors essential for HIV entry into target cells identified new targets for antiretroviral therapy. Viral entry can be inhibited in vitro by the natural ligands for CXCR4, the CXC chemokine SDF-1, and CCR5, the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2. Several peptidic compounds have been identified as CXCR4 antagonists that display anti-HIV activity, and the HIV-1 tat protein has been described as a \u201cnatural\u201d CXCR4 antagonist with anti-HIV-1 activity. The bicyclam derivatives are among the most potent and specific CXCR4 antagonists described and they block X4 HIV replication very efficiently (De Clercq and Schols, 2001). Mutants resistant to CCR5 antagonists have been isolated. This resistance is not mediated by a change in coreceptor usage, but rather by the ability to use CCR5 despite the presence of the inhibitor (Trkola et al., 2002). However, much remains to be learned about the possible physiological impact of the administration of receptor analogs and receptor ligands. The multitude of different receptors involved in HIV entry into cultured cells and their important physiological roles in vivo, together with their implications in distinct pathogenic processes, have added further complexity to this field of research (Heveker, 2001).",

In some other instances, soluble receptors were capable of inducing conformational changes in viral envelopes, and nonsusceptible cells became susceptible to viral infection. In the case of ASLV-A, soluble Tva could activate SU and convert it to a fusogenic conformation-competent form capable of mediating the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, even when the membranes did not harbor viral receptors (Damico and Bates, 2000). This has also been observed with murine leukemia viruses (Lavillette et al., 2000), with mouse hepatitis virus (Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002), and with HIV-1 in that CD4 on the surface of a cell could be used by the virus to fuse to neighboring cells, provided the latter had a coreceptor (even in the absence of CD4) (Speck et al., 1999).",

From the mechanisms exploited by viruses to escape antibodies, CTLs, or inhibitors and from the molecular basis of fitness gain, a number of pathways for the selection of mutants resistant to soluble receptors (or analogs) are plausible. Viral mutants could be selected that display an increased affinity for the receptor attached to the cell surface, and not for its soluble form (or analog). A completely independent pathway could be the selection of mutants able to use an unrelated receptor, as this has already been described even for viruses not subjected to the presence of receptor analogs (Section V,A). Yet another possibility is the selection of mutants capable of binding both the cellular receptor and the authentic receptor on the cell, with a slight affinity bias to permit cell entry, among other conceivable variations of these mechanisms.",

An obvious problem is the possible physiological impact of such a combination of receptors or their analogs. These difficulties should also be evaluated carefully if strategies employing combinations of inhibitors, receptor analogs, and immunotherapy are considered.

More than 40 emergent and reemergent human viral diseases have been described over the last two decades, and the adaptive potential of viruses, including changes in host range, undoubtedly has played a very relevant role (reviewed in Brault 2002, Leitmeyer 1999; specific recent examples in Morse 1993, Morse 1994). However, a complex set of interconnected influences are involved in viral disease emergence. These include environmental and climatic changes, socioeconomic and political factors, agricultural practices, and technological developments. The recent reemergence of the foot-and-mouth disease in Europe illustrates how a number of rather unpredictable and complex factors can produce a devastating animal disease epizootic (Samuel 2001, Sobrino 2001). Additional examples have been documented and discussed (Domingo 2001, Mahy 1997, Morse 1993, Morse 1994, Murphy 1994). These multiple influences have, as a net result, an alteration of viral traffic and of the demography of viral vectors and susceptible hosts (Morse, 1994), with the many implications of alterations of viral ecology (Hurst, 2000).",

The emergence of HIV stands as the most significant introduction of a retrovirus into the human population, likely from several simian virus ancestors, and the virus is evolving continuously through mutation and recombination (Crandall, 1999). Poliovirus variation has been signaled as a major problem for the successful eradication of poliovirus (Nomoto and Arita, 2002). Furthermore, poliovirus and the C-cluster coxsackie A viruses are grouped together based on phylogenetic analyses. It has been suggested that if polioviruses were eradicated, some coxsackie A viruses may have an opportunity to modify their receptor specificity from ICAM-1 to CD155 (Table II) and evolve toward a polio-like virus (Nomoto and Arita, 2002).",

No viral functions that depart in any outstanding way from similar cellular functions have been identified. This includes similarities between viral and cellular proteins involved in genome replication, proteolytic activities, and general patterns of genome organization and expression. These important advances in molecular genetics suggest that the exchange of modules, together with mutation, has contributed to the coadaptation of cells and autonomous replicons over long evolutionary periods (DeFilippis 2001, Domingo 2003, Domingo 1999, Gorbalenya 1995, Holland 1998). In cases in which viruses infect multiple host species, convergent phylogenies of viruses with their host can sometimes be seen (Gibbs 1999, McGeoch 1999). Some of the features of variation of cell tropism discussed in A, A may not be foreign to differentiated organisms. The insertion of two amino acids into ectodysplasin\u2014a member of the tumor necrosis-binding family\u2014resulted in a change of its cellular receptor specificity, and the differential expression of the two forms of ectodysplasin plays a role in epidermal morphogenesis (Yan et al., 2000).

It has been estimated that this part of the human genome is 40% of the total! The process by which cells from one organism have captured DNA fragments from another organism is known as horizontal gene transfer. This transfer appears to be particularly frequent in prokaryotes, but it does also occur in eukaryotes.

The human body comprises 50 trillion cells organized in hundreds of organs, tissues, and classes of cell subpopulations. Viruses may spread differentially within organs. As an example, the dissemination of neurotropic viruses in the brain is used increasingly to define connections among subsets of neurons (Card, 2001). To complete its incorporation into a new host cell, the transferred DNA must integrate into the recipient chromosome by some type of molecular recombination event. In this respect, integrative bacteriophages and retroviruses provide the adequate mechanisms as an integral part of their life cycles (Coffin et al., 1997). The retroviral reverse transcriptases must jump strands to complete the synthesis of cDNA, and this property may favor the capture of cellular sequences for transfer to other cells. The mechanisms that mediate the integration of lysogenic bacteriophage DNA, retroviral cDNAs, and a class of transposons termed non-LTR retrotransposons are different, as are the proteins involved (reviewed in Ptashne 1992, Bushman 2002, Coffin 1997). Nonidentical requirements for integration may have broadened the possibilities of DNA flow among cells in the course of evolution. About 8% of the human genome appears to have been derived from retroviral-like sequences. Retroviral-mediated gene transfer can have deep phenotypic consequences for cells, such as a variety of disease manifestations in differentiated organisms (McClure, 1999), including alterations of cell growth control, and in some cases of infertility in humans (Sun et al., 2000). Estimates using mice suggest that 40% of DNA insertion events may have phenotypic consequences for the animal (reviewed in Bushman, 2002).",

Indeed, many of the viruses referred to in previous sections may infect multiple host species, and through genetic change they may acquire the potential to infect other host species, therefore permitting gene transfers among distant host species and, perhaps occasionally, also among taxa. Many lines of evidence (too numerous to be reviewed here) have clearly documented DNA transfers among distant domains of life (bacteria to plants, bacteria to animal cells, etc.) (reviewed in Bushman, 2002). It is not known how many DNA transfer events are initiated and never completed, and of those in which the transfer is completed, how many lead to viable genotypes. Perhaps the sorting of viable recombinant genomes is parallel on long evolutionary times to the sorting of viable RNA genomes subjected to mutational pressure that occurs over infinitely short evolutionary time scales (Section II,B). In both cases, negative selection may eliminate many nascent mutant and recombinant forms to leave a surviving minority endowed with a minimally required relative fitness value. Genetic disease in differentiated organisms may be viewed as an unavoidable price to pay to ensure a source of genome fluidity for long-term survival.",

            "text": "Gene therapy is a growing field of research in molecular medicine, whose aim is the supply of a functional gene into human cells for the treatment of inherited or acquired genetic disorders (Lemoine, 2000). The application of DNA recombinant techniques, together with an understanding of the life cycle of viruses, has permitted the development of virus vectors for the transport of foreign genes into target cells. This technology takes advantage of one of the natural tendencies of viruses to act occasionally as agents of horizontal gene transfers, although for therapeutic purposes, viruses must be modified carefully to act as safe and efficient vectors. Viruses that have been used as gene vectors include adenoviruses, parvoviruses (adeno-associated viruses), herpesviruses, retroviruses (simple and complex lentiviruses such as HIV), SV40, and some RNA viruses such as Sindbis virus (reviewed in Pfeifer and Verma, 2001). Viral vectors are engineered to have the foreign \u201ctransgene\u201d replace deleted viral genes, while maintaining the cis-acting elements to form virions and to integrate the transgene. Packaging cells or plasmids provide in trans those proteins required for particle formation. A number of safety features (that necessitate different approaches for the different vector types) must be introduced to avoid the spread of replication-competent viruses in the organism, cytotoxic effects, or undesired gene damage due to unrestricted and random integration of transgene into human DNA. Important difficulties encountered in viral-mediated gene therapy are the immune response (antibody or cellular responses evoked by the vector or preexistent in the human recipient), vector stability, dependence of the transduction efficiency on the metabolic state, and cell cycle phase of the target cells, among others. From the point of view of targeting the desired target cells, the receptor specificity of the viral vectors is an essential element of vector safety and efficacy, and many of the considerations discussed in previous sections concerning variations in receptor specificity are relevant to the design of viral vectors, both regarding the basal amplitude of host range afforded by each vector type and the possibilities of engineered alterations in the vector surface proteins to attain a more defined cellular specificity. Vectors based on adeno-associated virus type 2 or retroviral pseudotypes containing the surface glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus display a broad host cell tropism. In contrast, vectors based on murine leukemia virus or HIV-1 often show restricted tropism, imposed by the receptors recognized by their surface envelope proteins (receptor types utilized by some viruses used for vector construction are listed in Table III). For some vectors, the host range can be expanded by replacing surface proteins (or subdomains) by heterologous counterparts, such as heterologous envelope proteins of retroviral vectors (Pfeifer and Verma, 2001).",

A process of coevolution has probably involved exchanges of genetic information between cells and viruses for long evolutionary periods. From this point of view, it is perhaps not surprising that present-day viruses show flexibility in receptor usage and a capacity to alter through mutation their receptor recognition specificity. Shifts in receptor usage have been documented for a variety of DNA and RNA viruses, and the list is increasing continuously. This is just one facet of the fluidity exhibited by cells and viruses regarding exchanges and variation of their genetic material. This is particularly spectacular for RNA viruses because they cannot replicate without producing mutants. The mutation rates, mutation frequencies, and population dynamics of DNA viruses during short-term evolution have been investigated far less than those of RNA viruses. For this reason, it is not possible to anticipate at present whether some DNA viruses may share with RNA viruses a rapid adaptation to using new receptors. It is possible that for the complex DNA viruses, due to a likely limited tolerance to generalized high mutation rates, modifications in receptor specificity will be less frequent than for RNA viruses, albeit with similar biological consequences once they occur.",

Therefore, a change in receptor specificity represents biological novelty not only in that a new cell type is infected, but also because the new environment may alter the mutant repertoire participating in subsequent rounds of infection. The application of microarray-based gene expression screening methods suggests considerable variation in expression patterns not only between different tissues and organs but also, on occasion, among cells of the same tissue.

Most of the studies on which we have based our arguments have been carried out with a single virus isolate, clone, or reference strain. Findings may be dependent on a particular sequence context of the viral genome in view of the compactness of information in viral genomes and the connections among genomic regions. It would not be surprising if similar studies with other representatives of the same virus genus yielded different results in the detail of the specific mutations associated with a phenotypic change regarding receptor recognition.

One protomer subunit of FMDV is shown as a ribbon diagram (VP1, blue; VP2, green; VP3, red) and the Fab is in violet. The flexible G-H loop of FMDV is located in an extended orientation with the RGD motif (depicted as a Van de Waals spheres) occupying a fully exposed position. The RGD triplet, in this complex, shows a similar conformation to that found for the same triplet when bound to the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Xiong et al., 2002). A least-squares superimposition of the main chain atoms from RGD residues in the FMDV loop with the equivalent residues in the integrin RGD ligand gives an average rms deviation of only 0.32 \u00c5. The transformation necessary to superimpose the FMDV loop to the integrin ligand can also be used to superimpose the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 onto the viral capsid to obtain an approximate docking model for the FMDV\u2013\u03b1v\u03b23 complex. (B) Ribbon drawing of a FMDV protomer together with the docked \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor (yellow). For clarity, only the \u03b2 propeller of subunit \u03b1 and the \u03b2A and hybrid domains of the subunid \u03b2 are represented. The docking model suggests that the \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor binds the FMDV G-H loop in an exposed position similar to that found when the loop is recognized by neutralizing antibodies.",
