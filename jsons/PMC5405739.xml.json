            "text": "\nCandida albicans is a common human commensal fungus as well as an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a wide range of diseases from relatively mild mucosal infections to systemic infections with mortality rates up to 37% (Wisplinghoff et al., 2004). C. albicans pathogenicity is linked to a switch between budding yeast and filamentous hyphal morphologies (Lo et al., 1997; Saville et al., 2003). While the compact yeast form may facilitate dissemination in the bloodstream, interaction of yeast cells with host epithelia leads to a transition to the hyphal form, which increases host\u2013cell adherence and promotes invasion into host tissues (Filler et al., 1995; Dalle et al., 2010). The yeast\u2010to\u2010hyphal transition is accompanied by many changes in gene expression that facilitate invasive infection such as the upregulation of cell\u2010surface adhesins and secreted hydrolases (De Groot et al., 2013; Schaller et al., 2005). Whereas the signaling molecules and transcription factors required for this transition have been studied intensively (Nantel et al., 2002; Kadosh and Johnson, 2005; Whiteway and Bachewich, 2007; Bruno et al., 2010; Sellam et al., 2010), much less is known about proteins with roles in post\u2010transcriptional events that could influence hyphal development and function.",

The eukaryotic serine\u2013arginine (SR) family of RNA\u2010binding proteins has numerous roles in the control of gene expression, from ubiquitous roles in splicing to impacts on mRNA transport, translation and stability (Shepard and Hertel, 2009; Long and Caceres, 2009; Zhong et al., 2009) and SR protein activity can influence metazoan cellular differentiation (Baker et al., 1989; Sen et al., 2013). SR proteins are characterized by the presence of one or two RNA\u2010recognition motifs (RRMs) and clusters of serine\u2013arginine/arginine\u2013serine (SR/RS) dipeptides. SR protein function and localization are frequently modulated by phosphorylation of the SR/RS dipeptides (Long and Caceres, 2009). While Schizosaccharomyces pombe has SR proteins (Srp1 and Srp2), neither S. cerevisiae nor C. albicans has canonical SR proteins; rather, these yeasts encode SR\u2010like proteins that also include one or two RRMs, but which have repetitive arginine (R)\u2010rich domains with fewer SR/RS dipeptides (Plass et al., 2008). These R\u2010rich domains are often targets for arginine methylation (Henry and Silver, 1996; McBride et al., 2007; Ariyachet et al., 2013). The most thoroughly studied yeast SR\u2010like protein, S. cerevisiae Npl3, has been implicated in many aspects of mRNA metabolism from transcription and splicing to mRNA export and translation (Kadowaki et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1996; Bucheli and Buratowski, 2005; Dermody et al., 2008; Kress et al., 2008; Baierlein et al., 2013). Both ScNpl31 and its S. pombe ortholog, SpSrp2, are essential, whereas SpSrp1 is not essential (Bossie et al., 1992; Gross et al., 1998; Lutzelberger et al., 1999).",

Absence of this C. albicans SpSrp1 ortholog decreases C. albicans growth rate more than deletion of the ScNPL3/SpSRP2 ortholog CaNPL3. SLR1 deletion slows hyphal formation, leads to a defect in host cell damage in vitro and lowers virulence in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis (Ariyachet et al., 2013). Absence of Slr1 also increases exposure of hyphal\u2010specific adhesin Als3 on the cell surface, suggesting the importance of Slr1 for proper hyphal structure (Ariyachet et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Given the importance of Slr1 for C. albicans hyphal formation and virulence and its sequence similarity to other yeast SR and SR\u2010like proteins, we sought to address whether the sequence similarities reflect functional similarities, including identifying the molecular interactions and modifications of Slr1 and testing the impact of post\u2010translational modifications on Slr1 intracellular localization. Interestingly, we find that C\u2010terminal S\u2010to\u2010A mutations that block Slr1 phosphorylation also cause Slr1 to accumulate not only in the cytoplasm of yeast\u2010form cells, but also at the hyphal tip in a region close to the Spitzenk\u00f6rper, a vesicular structure involved in trafficking lipids and proteins to the tip. The hyphal tip localization of mutant Slr1 is also partially dependent on the presence of mRNA transport protein She3. Combined with additional evidence that wildtype Slr1 interacts with polyadenylated RNA and mRNA\u2010binding proteins, these results suggest a model in which unphosphorylated Slr1 associates with mRNA\u2013protein complexes transported to the hyphal tip where the mRNA is locally translated and that phosphorylation facilitates release of Slr1 from such transport complexes. In fact, Slr1 is detected in polysomes, supporting a potential role in translation. The impact of SLR1 deletion on hyphal formation and function thus may be due in part to a role in hyphal mRNA transport and translation.",

BLASTP searches with the RRM of Slr1 revealed its similarity to RRMs of SR\u2010like proteins S. pombe Srp1 and Aspergillus nidulans SwoK (Fig. 1B); similar RRMs were also identified in other fungi from Lachancea thermotolerans to Ustilago maydis (Supporting Information Fig. S1), but not in S. cerevisiae. A motif common to many metazoan SR proteins that overlaps with RNP\u20101 (EFEDxRDAEDA), however, is better conserved in AnSwoK and SpSrp1 than in CaSlr1 (Fig. 1B, boldface). The amino acid composition within the low complexity R\u2010rich region also differs among these proteins: RG dipeptides predominate in Slr1, RD dipeptides in AnSwoK and RS dipeptides in SpSrp1 (Fig. 1C). In addition, AnSwoK and SpSrp1 have regions C\u2010terminal to this R\u2010rich domain (Fig. 1A and C). Thus, the RRM is more highly conserved among Slr1\u2010related proteins than the C\u2010terminal region.",

In addition, the C\u2010terminus of ScNpl3 (ReRSPtR) (Fig.1C), which influences cellular localization of ScNpl3 through its phosphorylation (Yun and Fu, 2000; Gilbert et al., 2001), resembles that of Slr1 (RsRSPeRy). This region is critical for ScNpl3 function: deletion of the R\u2010rich region and C\u2010terminus severely abrogates S. cerevisiae growth (McBride et al., 2009). Therefore, to determine whether this sequence similarity is functionally relevant, the ability of the R\u2010rich region of Slr1 to substitute for that of ScNpl3 was tested. As shown in Fig. 1D, chimeric ScNpl3 proteins bearing the Slr1 R\u2010rich domain supported growth of S. cerevisiae cells lacking Npl3 (npl3\u0394). The Slr1 R\u2010rich region linked to the ScNpl3 C\u2010terminus supported only slightly more growth of npl3\u0394 cells than when it was linked to the Slr1 C\u2010terminus (Fig. 1D, compare rows 3 and 4). These results suggest that the Slr1 R\u2010rich region can mediate similar molecular interactions to those mediated by the ScNpl3 R\u2010rich region, but that these regions of the two proteins are not functionally identical.",

Proteins bound to poly(A) RNAs were released by RNase treatment and Slr1\u2010TAP was detected by anti\u2010Protein A immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 2A, Slr1\u2010TAP did co\u2010purify when crosslinked to poly(A) RNA. In contrast, Slr1\u2010TAP was not purified from untreated cell lysates (Fig. 2A), indicating that Slr1\u2010TAP does not bind non\u2010specifically to the oligo (dT) resin.

The mRNA\u2010binding activity of Slr1 (Fig. 2A) suggested that the co\u2010purification of the cap\u2010binding complex proteins might be due to simultaneous binding of Slr1 and the CBC to the same mRNA. Consistent with this model, RNase treatment of lysates prior to Slr1\u2010TAP isolation eliminated co\u2010purification of the Cbc\u2010GFP proteins (Fig. 2C).

Wild type Slr1\u2010GFP expressed from its native promoter localizes predominantly to the nucleus of C. albicans, as detected by colocalization with DAPI (Fig. 3A, panel c). This steady state nuclear localization contrasts with the whole cell localization of SpSrp1 (Tang et al., 2007), but is similar to that seen for ScNpl3\u2010family proteins and the CBC (Shen et al., 2000; Yun and Fu, 2000; Gilbert et al., 2001; McBride et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007). In addition, Slr1\u2010GFP appears in brighter puncta with slightly fainter fluorescence throughout the nucleus (Fig. 3B), reminiscent of the localization of metazoan SR proteins to nuclear speckles (Gui et al., 1994). This localization supports a model in which Slr1 has functions within the nucleus, but does not rule out cytoplasmic functions, as many SR\u2010like proteins are dynamic and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Flach et al., 1994; Hacker and Krebber, 2004; Tang et al., 2007).",

Removal of 42 amino acids in the middle of this domain decreased the percentage of Slr1\u2010GFP found in the nucleus (%N) and the ratio of mean nuclear to mean cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity (N/C), indicating a slight shift to the cytoplasm at steady state (Fig. 3A, C, slr1\u0394151\u2010192). Slr1 lacking an additional 30 residues primarily within the N\u2010terminal half of this domain, however, showed more distinct cytoplasmic localization than slr1\u0394151\u2010192 (Fig. 3A, C; slr1\u0394123\u2010194). These results were confirmed in two additional independent experiments. The increased detection of the mutant proteins in the cytoplasm did not result from protein instability: the mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels to wildtype Slr1\u2010GFP (Supporting Information Fig. S2). In addition, the slight cytoplasmic localization of wildtype Slr1\u2010GFP was not due to autofluorescence: cells that did not express GFP had significantly lower mean cytoplasmic fluorescence than Slr1\u2010GFP\u2010expressing cells (Supporting Information Fig. S3).

These findings were confirmed in two additional independent experiments. The increased cytoplasmic localization of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP was not due to the release of GFP from the fusion protein, as indicated by the absence of < 40 kDa proteins detected by an anti\u2010GFP antibody (Fig. 5E).

We, therefore, developed a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay with an oligo(dT) probe to detect the localization of bulk mRNA in cells with and without Slr1 (Fig. 6). In S. cerevisiae, such assays detect the cytoplasmic localization of polyadenylated mRNA, which becomes predominantly nuclear in the presence of mutations that block mRNA export (Singleton et al., 1995). In addition, heat shock treatment of S. cerevisiae at 42\u00b0C blocks bulk mRNA export while not affecting export of heat shock mRNAs (Saavedra et al., 1996; Tani et al., 1996).",

S. cerevisiae SR\u2010like protein Npl3 is required for monosome formation during translation initiation and co\u2010fractionates with polysomes (Windgassen et al., 2004; Baierlein et al., 2013). We, therefore, compared the migration of wildtype Slr1\u2010GFP with that of ribosomal protein Rps3 through sucrose density gradients (Fig. 7). While the majority of Slr1\u2010GFP was detected in non\u2010ribosomal and ribosomal subunit fractions (79%; Fig. 7B), 21% was found in fractions that contained the 80S ribosome and polysomes. This association of Slr1\u2010GFP with 80S and translating ribosomes was abrogated by treatment of lysates with RNase A prior to centrifugation (Fig. 7C).

Cells incorporate the lipophilic dye FM4\u201064 into endocytic vesicles, leading to rapid accumulation in vacuolar membranes (Vida and Emr, 1995). In growing hyphae, however, FM4\u201064 can be seen in the Spitzenk\u00f6rper in a brief window after exposure to the dye (Crampin et al., 2005). Yeast\u2010form cells expressing slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP were diluted in hyphal\u2010inducing medium, incubated at 37\u00b0C and exposed to FM4\u201064 three hours after hyphal induction. In 65% of cells with distinct Spitzenk\u00f6rper FM4\u201064 staining, this fluorescence partially colocalized with a slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP focus at the hyphal tip (Fig. 9A, panels b\u2013d) and in 4%\u20138% of hyphae, an slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP focus was adjacent to the Spitzenk\u00f6rper (Table 1). The ability of FM4\u201064 to stain the Spitzenk\u00f6rper was confirmed by hyphal tip colocalization of FM4\u201064 with a fluorescent myosin light\u2010chain 1 fusion protein (Mlc1\u2010YFP), a known Spitzenk\u00f6rper protein (Crampin et al., 2005) (Fig. 9B, Table 1). Line scans demonstrating the partial colocalization of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP and Mlc1\u2010YFP with the Spitzenk\u00f6rper are shown in Supporting Information Fig. S4. The localization of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP to a region of the hypha near the Spitzenk\u00f6rper suggested that this protein might associate with transport complexes, for example by binding to mRNAs that are transported to the hyphal tip.",

The C. albicans She3 ortholog binds to at least 37 mRNAs during hyphal growth (Elson et al., 2009). At least 12 of these transcripts localize to the hyphal tip and this localization requires the CaShe3 protein (Elson et al., 2009). We hypothesized that the accumulation of the mRNA\u2010binding protein slr1\u20106SA at the hyphal tip might depend on mRNA transport to the tip. We therefore expressed slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP in C. albicans strains without CaShe3 (Fig. 10). In cells lacking She3, many fewer cells contained slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP foci at the hyphal tip (Fig. 10A, panels g\u2013l); the percentage of hyphal tips containing slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP foci is over three times lower in strains without She3 than in strains bearing a single copy of SHE3 (Fig. 10B). In contrast, slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP formed cytoplasmic foci in the presence or absence of She3 (Fig. 10A). The average percentage of hyphal tips with slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP foci in the presence of She3 (70.3% \u00b1 2.6%SEM) was consistent with the average percentage of hyphae with slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP foci that partially overlapped with (65%) or were adjacent to (4%\u20138%) the Spitzenk\u00f6rper (Table 1). These results indicated that slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP localization specifically to the hyphal tip is partially dependent on She3, suggesting the association of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP with She3\u2010transported mRNAs.",

This clustering of SR/RS dipeptides in Slr1 raises the question of whether the regulation of Slr1 by phosphorylation may be more similar to that of SpSrp1 family proteins than that of ScNpl3. Phosphatase treatment of Slr1\u2010GFP and slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP indicated that Slr1 is likely phosphorylated at multiple sites within the SR region (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation of one or more residues may control additional phosphorylation events, as seen in the sequential phosphorylation of serine residues in human SR protein ASF/SF2 (Ngo et al., 2008). Whereas wildtype Slr1\u2010GFP is predominantly nuclear, the S\u2010to\u2010A substitutions increase cytoplasmic levels of Slr1\u2010GFP, suggesting that phosphorylation promotes import of Slr1 (Fig. 5), potentially by facilitating interaction with a conserved Mtr10 import receptor complex, as seen for S. cerevisiae Npl3 (Yun and Fu, 2000). Phosphorylation of the SR domain of multiple metazoan SR proteins similarly allows binding to the importin transportin\u2010SR (Lai et al., 2000). The cytoplasmic localization of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP in C. albicans decreases in the absence of arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 (Fig. 5), supporting a role for methylation in nuclear export of Slr1, as seen for ScNpl3 and CaNpl3 (Shen et al., 1998; McBride et al., 2007). Therefore, the impact of post\u2010translational modification on Slr1 nucleocytoplasmic transport is more similar to the effects of modifications on Npl3 family proteins than on SpSrp1, correlating with greater similarity of the Npl3 and Slr1 R\u2010rich domains rather than with the clustered arrangement of SR/RS motifs.",

These foci could reflect increased interaction of cytoplasmic unphosphorylated slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP with ribonucleoprotein complexes in subcellular domains such as RNA\u2010processing bodies (P\u2010bodies), stress granules (Buchan and Parker, 2009), or target regions for mRNA transport. P\u2010bodies accumulate during C. albicans hyphal induction (Jung and Kim, 2011), but they are not specifically detected at the hyphal tip; the less intense slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP foci present throughout the hypha (e.g., Fig. 10A) may indicate association of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP with these RNA\u2010rich cytoplasmic regions. Lack of phosphorylation of an SR motif in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) nucleocapsid protein has been implicated in accumulation of this viral SR protein in stress granules (Peng et al., 2008). The localization of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP to cytoplasmic foci suggests that phosphorylation may prevent accumulation of this SR\u2010like protein in similar mRNA\u2010rich structures.",

In S. cerevisiae, the absence of the kinase ScSky1 or the presence of an S\u2010to\u2010A mutation in ScNpl3 increases the binding of ScNpl3 to poly(A) RNA, indicating a role for phosphorylation in promoting cytoplasmic mRNA release as well as in nuclear ScNpl3 import (Gilbert et al., 2001). CaShe3 is the primary C. albicans protein known to facilitate mRNA transport to the hypha (Elson et al., 2009); this fungus lacks an ortholog of ScShe2, a key mRNA\u2010binding protein in S. cerevisiae that couples nuclear export of ASH1 mRNA to formation of the She3 mRNA transport complex in the cytoplasm (Bohl et al., 2000). While slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP still forms cytoplasmic foci in hyphal cells lacking CaShe3, the absence of CaShe3 reduces the number of cells with foci at the hyphal tip (Fig. 10). This result suggests that slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP may travel with CaShe3 mRNA transport complexes to the hyphal tip.",

FM4\u201064 staining of the Spitzenk\u00f6rper in strains expressing slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP indicated that these two structures partially overlap (Fig. 9A; Supporting Information Fig. S4). Sudbery and colleagues recently demonstrated that the C. albicans Sec2 protein, a Guanine Exchange Factor involved in vesicular transport to the hyphal tip, binds to the Sec2 mRNA and that wildtype Sec2 mRNA and protein colocalize in the Spitzenk\u00f6rper (Caballero\u2010Lima et al., 2014). A phosphomimetic mutation in Sec2 decreases Sec2 protein binding to and colocalization with Sec2 mRNA in the Spitzenk\u00f6rper (Caballero\u2010Lima et al., 2014). These results support a model in which phosphorylation of Sec2 helps regulate Sec2 mRNA transport to the hyphal tip (Caballero\u2010Lima et al., 2014). Phosphorylation of She3, Khd1 and Puf6 RNA\u2010binding proteins in S. cerevisiae has also been linked to polarized ASH1 mRNA transport and translation regulation (Paquin et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2008; Landers et al., 2009). The colocalization of slr1\u20106SA\u2010GFP with the Spitzenk\u00f6rper suggests both that mRNA\u2010binding proteins in addition to Sec2 and She3 could influence transport of mRNAs to the hyphal tip and that such mRNP complexes could be regulated similarly by phosphorylation of RNA\u2010binding proteins including Slr1.",

The RNA\u2010dependent interaction of Slr1 with the nuclear mRNA cap\u2010binding complex, which affects mRNA splicing, transport, stability and translation in S. cerevisiae (Topisirovic et al., 2011; Garre et al., 2012), suggests that Slr1 may also have complex roles in Candida RNA metabolism.

GFP, DAPI and DIC images were then stacked in ImageJ v1.49 (Schneider et al., 2012) and cells with in\u2010focus nuclei were identified. The method of Hood\u2010DeGrenier (Hood\u2010DeGrenier et al., 2007) was modified to calculate two metrics of subcellular localization: percent nuclear fluorescence intensity (%N) and mean nuclear\u2010to\u2010cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity (N/C). For each cell, the whole cell and the nucleus were selected on DIC and DAPI images, respectively, and area and average pixel intensity (API) were measured for each selection on the GFP image. Selection was performed in triplicates for each cell using a Wacom Cintiq 13HD touch tablet; the mean of the three area and API measurements was used for subsequent calculations. For each image, the API of background regions lacking cells was subtracted from the whole\u2010cell and nuclear API measurements. The total nuclear and whole cell pixel intensities (TPIN and TPIWC) were calculated by multiplying the average area (A) by the background\u2010adjusted API. Percent nuclear fluorescence (%N) was calculated by dividing TPIN by TPIWC. The ratio of the API of the nucleus to the API of the cytoplasm (N/C) was calculated as follows: N/C = APIN/[(TPIWC \u2212 TPIN)/(AWC \u2212 AN)]. Three independent experiments were performed for each set of strains and the data analyzed in R (R Core Team, 2016). Differences among cells of different genotypes in a single experiment were evaluated by the Kruskal\u2010Wallis rank sum test (p < 0.0001 for all experiments), given the non\u2010normal distribution of the data. Pairwise Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were then used to determine whether the localization of specific Slr1\u2010GFP proteins differed from each other.
