            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to Coronaviridae family. The disease is prevalent in all countries with almost 100% incidence rate. Chicken and commercially reared pheasant are the natural host for IBV. Virus causes respiratory diseases, poor weight gain, feed efficiency in broiler, damage to oviduct, and abnormal egg production in mature hens resulting in economic losses. IBV also replicates in tracheal and renal epithelial cells leading to prominent tracheal and kidney lesions. Virus undergoes spontaneous mutation leading to continual emergence of new variants. The effectiveness of immunization program is diminished because of poor cross-protection among the serotypes. Identification of circulating serotypes is important in controlling IBV infection. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR21 are involved in early recognition of virus resulting in induction of inflammatory cytokines. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are important in the control of infection. Humoral immunity plays an important role in recovery and clearance of viral infection. IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induce lysis of IBV-infected cells. Effective diagnostic tools are required at field level to identify different IBV variants. Embryonated chicken eggs are effective model for virus isolation. Identification by other specific methods like virus neutralization (VN), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, or nucleic acid analysis or by electron microscopy is also indispensable. VN test in tracheal organ culture is the best method for antigenic typing for surveillance purposes. Continuous epidemiological surveillance, strict biosecurity measures, and vaccine effective against various serotypes are necessary for controlling IB in chickens.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious upper respiratory tract disease affecting chicken of all ages with significant economic threat to the poultry industry. It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales. The disease causes symptoms like watery eyes, mucus in the nares and trachea, sneezing, tracheal rales, and coughing. In layer birds, IB results in decreased egg production as well as quality, and some IBV variants cause interstitial nephritis. Infection with IBV causes ciliostasis in the trachea and predisposes to the secondary pathogens further complicating the disease. Morbidity is always 100%; however, mortality can vary from 0 to 82% depending upon the age of the birds, immune status, strain of the virus, and involvement of secondary pathogens. The virus possesses a single copy of positive-sense single-stranded RNA as its genome, which is approximately 27.6 kb in size. The genome undergoes genetic recombination and spontaneous mutation leading to the emergence of new variants having low level of cross-protection and complicates the control program by vaccination (Cavanagh and Gelb 2008; Jackwood et al. 2012) . The IBV-like coronaviruses were also detected in pheasant, peafowl, turkey, teal, geese, pigeon, guinea fowl, partridge, penguins, and ducks (Dea and Tijssen 1989; Jonassen et al. 2005; Cavanagh 2005; Circella et al. 2007 ). The IBV is worldwide in distribution, and infection is acquired through inhalation or direct contact with infected birds or premises. Vertical transmission is not reported. Some of the IBV strains can also replicate in the kidneys, reproductive tract, and enteric surfaces resulting in the development of nephritis, misshapen eggs, and enteritis, respectively (Boltz et al. 2004 ). Induction of apoptosis in kidney cells is a major contributor of pathogenicity for virulent nephropathogenic IBV (Liu et al. 2017) . The disease affects both egg and meat type of chickens. Respiratory disease is observed in the young growing chickens while reduced weight gain and feed efficiency in broiler chickens. IBV infection predisposes the broiler birds to secondary bacterial infection resulting in airsacculitis, pericarditis, and perihepatitis. In layers and breeder chickens, IBV replicates in the oviduct causing permanent damage or limited egg production. Pigment of the affected shell becomes paler and albumin is watery in consistency. The virus has not been reported to cause human infection.",

The virus particles are approximately 120 nm in diameter with club-shaped spikes in their surface, which provide them a crown-like appearance (Jackwood and de Witt 2013) . The genome encodes 4 structural proteins, 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp 2-16), and at least 5 lineage-specific accessory proteins (Dent et al. 2015) . Structural proteins are spike (S), membrane (M), small membrane (E), and nucleoprotein (N). The spike protein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits where the former is involved in virus entry to the host cell via sialic acid receptor and also harbors virus-neutralizing epitopes (Lai and Cavanagh 1997; Cavanagh 2007; Cavanagh et al. 1986; Koch et al. 1990; Niesters et al. 1987) . S2 subunit anchors the spike protein, and the ectodomain of S2 protein also aids in the attachment of virus to the host cells (Promkuntod et al. 2013) . M protein is the most abundant transmembrane protein that interacts with N and S glycoprotein for virion assembly (de Haan et al. 2000; Bande et al. 2015) . E protein is scant and confined to the Golgi apparatus of the infected cell. This protein plays a key role in viral envelope formation, assembly, budding, ion channel activity, and apoptosis (Corse and Machamer 2003; Wilson et al. 2006) . Ribonucleoprotein is formed by interaction of N protein to the genomic RNA of IBV and aids in transcription, replication, and translation of viral genome (Jayaram et al. 2005) .",

Two years later, similar disease was reported by Bushnell and Brandly. Since the disease could be transmitted by Berkefeld filtered material, they recognized the causative agent as filterable virus and was confused with infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV; Bushnell and Brandly 1933) . The causative agent was established in 1936 by Beach and Schalm who proved that IBV was distinct from ILTV by cross-immunity studies. Although young chicks were found to be affected by IBV, later it was observed to be common in mature and laying hens. IBV was first cultivated in chick embryos by inoculating through chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Unlike ILT, IBV did not show distinctive lesions on CAM and rather resulted in embryo death (Beaudette and Hudson 1937) . Jungherr and coworkers first reported more than one serotypes of IBV. It has been shown that Massachusetts (Mass) isolate in 1941 and Connecticut (Conn) isolate in 1951 produced identical disease but did not cross-protect each other (Jungherr et al. 1956 ).",

            "text": "IBV is a highly infectious disease and birds show clinical signs within 36-48 h of infection. Infected chicks are the major source of virus contamination in the environment. Virus is transmitted through respiratory secretions and fecal droplet from infected chicken. Virus may also spread from one flock to another through inanimate objects including contaminated utensils, egg-packing materials, fertilizer, and farm visit. Vertical transmission of virus has not been reported. Trachea, kidney, and bursa of Fabricius show the presence of the virus as early as 24 h and through the seventh day following aerosol transmission (Cavanagh and Gelb 2008) . The presence of virus in the cecal tonsils up to 14 weeks and from the feces up to 20 weeks correlates with the viral transmission through fecal shedding (Alexander and Gough 1977) . Birds recover from infection within 14 days with a rise in antibody titer. It has been reported that IBV re-excreted from virus-negative birds for several weeks following recovery from inoculation at 1 day of age. Isolation of virus from tracheal and cloacal swabs at the time of lay and 19 weeks of age was reported (Jones and Ambali 1987) . Establishment of latent infection and erratic shedding of virus in feces and respiratory secretion for a prolonged period of time are possible in a very few cases (Ignjatovic and Sapats 2000) . Kidney may be one of the sites of persistent infection . Vaccine viruses persist up to 163 days or more in various internal organs (Gay 2000) . Prolonged or intermittent shedding of virus is considered as a potential risk factor for transmission of virus from one flock to another through contaminated equipment or persons.",

IBV strains can be classified by genotyping-and serotyping-based methods. Viral serotypes can be distinguished by crossneutralization test and genotypes by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques, bioinformatics, and gene sequencing technology. S1 gene of IBV variants can be amplified and the sequences are analyzed by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; Posada and Crandall 2001) . IBV strains like Mass, 4/91, D274, and QX-like are reported worldwide. Some of the IBV strains are more prevalent in particular geographical location. M41, Arkansas (Ark) and Conn are common in the United States, while 4/91 (793/B, CR88) and D274 are predominant strains in Europe. In recent times, the Chinese QX variants have caused outbreaks in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa (Bande et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Predominant strains of IBV isolated in China are QX-like strains (Ma et al. 2012) . IBV QX strain-affected chickens showed proventriculus swelling which was first documented in 1996 (Yudong et al. 1998 ). The proportion of QX isolates has increased from 20% in 2000 to 60% in 2007. Recent isolates in China are LDT3 and 4/91 (Feng et al. 2014; Li et al. 2010; Ji et al. 2011) . Attenuated live strains such as H120, LDT3, 4/91, and inactivated M41 are the commercially used vaccine strains in China. Previous studies reported that Mass type of strains is widely in circulation. Recombination of Mass type with other strain resulted in complete cross-protection of Mass strain by H120 strain. However, two recombinant strains (CK/CH/ LDL/110931 and CK/CH/LHB/130573) are highly variable in S1 gene from Mass type and are not cross-neutralized by H120 strain (Chen et al. 2015; Han et al. 2011) . Since 2009, the emergence of Taiwan group (TW-I and TW-II) of strains have been increased in China Feng et al. 2014; Zou et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2012) . Recombinants GD strain, created from QX and TW-I strains, induced renal lesions, respiratory symptoms, and 40% mortality Yan et al. 2016 ). JP-I, JP-II, and JP-III are three genetic groups of IBV in Japan. Different variants of 4/91 strains are isolated (Inoue et al. 2008; Shimazaki et al. 2009 ). Two variants of 4/91 strain (JP/Wakayama/2003 and JP/Iwate/2005) are cross-neutralized by 4/91, JP-I and 4/91, JP-II strains, respectively. Ibaraki strain isolated in 2009 was distinctly related to other Japanese strain. Korean group-I and group-II are the two genetic groups of IBV that exist in Korea. Group-I is closely related to Mass type. There are three subgroups of group-II, namely, KM91-like, New Cluster 1 (NC1), and QX-like (Lim et al. 2011) . Korean group-II isolates that emerged from 2005 to 2010 were nephropathogenic (Lim et al. 2011 ). Since 2009, predominant isolates circulating in Thailand are QX-like variants (Promkuntod et al. 2015) . Indian IBV isolate PDRC/Pune/Ind/1/00 was found to have a unique S1 sequence compared to reference strains from the United States, Europe, Mexico, and Australia and found as nephropathogenic (Bayry et al. 2005) . 4/91 type strain was first isolated in India by Sumi et al. in 2012. An Indian IBV strain (India/LKW/56/IVRI/08) showed 99% homology with a Thailand strain (THA280252), while another isolate (India/ NMK/72/IVRI/10) showed similarity with the United Kingdom (4/91 pathogenic strain), Japan (JP/Wakayama/2/2004), and China (TA03) (Sumi et al. 2012) . Indian strain that was isolated in 2015 by Patel and coworkers was similar to Mass type vaccine M41 strain. Six IBV genotypes, namely, 4/91, IS/1494/06, Mass, IS/885/00, Q1, and D274, were detected in the Middle East from 2009 to 2014 . Analysis of complete genome sequence of a field strain of IBV from the northern part of India indicated the emergence of a genotype I variant of IBV (Jakhesara et al. 2018 ). China-like strains (CK/CH/Guangdong/Xindadi/0903 and CK/CH/LDL/97I) are also reported in the Middle East (Seger et al. 2016; Ababneh et al. 2012) . LDL/97I-like strains isolated in the Middle East showed extensive tissue tropism such as trachea, kidneys, ovarian tissue, and cecal tonsils, whereas original LDL/97I strains were limited to the respiratory system and kidneys.",

TLR3 mRNA expression was more following IBV-M41 strain infection (Wang et al. 2006) , and upregulation of TLR3 and TLR7 mRNA was detected in the trachea and lungs when chicks were intratracheally infected with Conn strain (Kameka et al. 2014) . Nephropathogenic IBV infection significantly increases chicken myeloma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5) expression in the kidneys, which indicate the role of chicken MDA5 against IBV infection (Cong et al. 2013) . Chicken mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a member of C-type collectin family, has antiviral activity against IBV. It binds to S1 protein of IBV and blocks the attachment of viral particles to the surface of the susceptible cells in the chicken trachea ). In addition, MBL also plays a major role in shaping innate as well as adaptive immune responses against IBV (Hamzic et al. 2016; Juul-Madsen et al. 2011; Kjaerup et al. 2014b ). Further, a high level of MBL contributes to the clearance of IBV from the trachea (Juul-Madsen et al. 2011; Kjaerup et al. 2014a) .",

IBV infection induces interferon in the trachea, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen (Otsuki et al. 1987) . Replication of IBV strains both in vitro and in vivo was inhibited in the presence of IFN-\u03b1. Both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 transcripts are elevated in the trachea after IBV infection. Among type I interferon, IFN-\u03b2 has a dominant role in the innate immune response against IBV infection . IFN-\u03b3 contributes to the tracheal lesions, and IFN-\u03bb plays a major role in the host resistance against IBV especially in the trachea ). IBV can act as a polyclonal stimulator of IFN-\u03b3 production in the chicken leukocytes, which is IBV-specific as other chicken viruses were unable to do the same (Ariaans et al. 2009 ). Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 were upregulated at 3 days post-IBV-M41 infection. These cytokines have association with increased viral load and tracheal lesions as well as defects in eggshell components in the laying hens (Okino et al. 2014; Nii et al. 2014) .",

Upon phagocytosis, heterophils degranulate cytotoxic molecules like cathepsin and bactericidal permeability increasing protein and thus try to neutralize phagocytosed pathogen. Heterophils are responsible for destruction of IBV-infected cells by phagocytosis and oxidative lysosomal enzyme release during the initial phase of infection (Guo et al. 2008) . Further, depletion of heterophils causes more severe nasal exudation in comparison with control when infected with IBV . Activation of macrophages is based mainly on the action of IFN-\u03b3 (Caron 2010) . Macrophages were found to increase in number in the tracheal and bronchial lumen of chickens at 24 and 96 h post-IBV-M41 infection (Fulton et al. 1993) . Similarly, chickens infected with Conn strain significantly increased macrophages in the lungs and trachea at 24 h post-infection (hpi), suggesting the role of respiratory macrophages in limiting replication of virus within respiratory tissues (Kameka et al. 2014 ). Recruitment of macrophages and production of IL-1\u03b2 play a major role in the host responses against IBV infection (Amarasinghe et al. 2018) .",

Oneday-old chicks with high level of maternal antibodies showed more than 95% protection against IBV-Mass strain challenge. However, this was not evident at 7 days of its age. Protection was associated with local respiratory antibodies but not with serum antibodies (Mondal and Naqi 2001) . Day-old chicks when vaccinated with live IBV-Mass strain showed no IBV-specific antibody response. This may be due to binding and neutralization of vaccine virus by maternal antibodies (Mondal and Naqi 2001) . Prime boost strategies involve vaccination with live strain followed by inactivated vaccine to protect hens throughout their laying period as well as to transfer high level of antibodies to their offspring (Chhabra et al. 2015) .",

Cloacal swabs or cecal tonsils are the sample of choice during postmortem examination if time is elapsed more than 1 week from the start of infection. This may be due to the initial growth of virus in the upper respiratory tract and eventual spread to the non-respiratory organs. This results in the early clearance of virus from trachea than from the intestinal tissues (Alexander and Gough 1977; Jones and Ambali 1987; Lucio and Fabricant 1990) . Based on clinical history, sampling of other organs like the lung, kidney, and oviduct should also be considered. Sentinel chickens should be placed in the problematic flock where direct sampling method is difficult. After 1 week of contact exposure, sentinels are removed for direct sampling method (Gelb et al. 1989 ).",

The antibodies against group-specific antigen of one serotype can neutralize different serotypes, while antibodies against S1 protein of the virus are type-specific and are not cross-protective between different serotypes (Cavanagh and Gelb 2008) . The serological tests like, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and immunodiffusion test cannot differentiate different serotypes because antibodies bind to both group-and type-specific antigens, while VN and HI are serotype-specific tests. Therefore, VN, HI, and ELISA are routinely used serological methods (de Wit 2000) . Precipitating antibodies in the group-specific agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) test are short lived which may lead to under-detection. Positive AGPT is indicative of recent infection. Birds infected with the same serotype as vaccine virus lead to poor production of antibodies as detected by AGPT. Thus, AGPT is not recommended for detection of IBV antibodies and rather for detection of IBV antigen (de Wit et al. 1997 (de Wit et al. , 1998 . IBV ELISAs are group-specific methods and detect IBV antibodies within 1 week of infection. Paired serum samples are required with first sample collected at the beginning of infection and second sample at 4 weeks later. The first sample should be collected without any delay for detection of seroconversion. Hence, ELISA analyzes post-vaccination and infection responses by IgG detection as an indicator of humoral immunity (Cavanagh and Gelb 2008) . VN and HI are serotype-specific techniques for detection of antibodies induced by S1 protein. VN can be carried out in embryonated egg, cell culture, and tracheal ring culture to detect embryo alterations, cytopathic effect, and ciliostasis, respectively. This assay requires neutralizing antibodies that are highly specific and do not cross-react with other serotypes. IBV requires treatment with type C phospholipase enzyme to expose hemagglutinin. HI test usually detects antibodies between 1 and 2 weeks after infection (de Wit 2000) .",

Swabs containing only a small amount of viral RNA can be detected by nested RT-PCR. However, this method is highly prone to cross-contamination resulting in a false-positive test.

In most countries, low virulent IBV vaccines are administered in day-old chicks with subsequent booster immunization with virulent vaccines in drinking water. Unlike highly virulent vaccine, low virulent IBV do not cause respiratory reaction. However, immunity produced by low virulent IBV is not always enough to protect the respiratory tract (Kataria et al. 2005) . Prior to immunization with oil-emulsion-inactivated vaccines, breeders and commercial egg layers are initially primed with live attenuated IBV vaccines in order to maintain a good level of local protection of the respiratory tract. Oilemulsion-inactivated vaccines are given at 17 weeks of age (prior to egg laying of breeder or layer) and never during laying (Jackwood et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2009 ).",

Prolonged or lifelong immune response can be achieved through vaccination under optimal conditions (Cook et al. 2012; Dhama et al. 2014) . Mass serotype, such as H120, is the most commonly used strain in live vaccines. Initially, birds are either vaccinated individually by eye drop instillation, intranasal and intratracheal routes, or mass vaccination by coarse spray or drinking water. Such mass vaccination procedures are cost-effective and induce both local and systemic immune responses. Ma5 is a single-component vaccine that can be included in first vaccination programs with IB 4/91 vaccines and inactivated vaccines. This type of vaccination program provides broad protection against different IBV serotypes. Selection of vaccine must be based on the prevalent strains in the local area. Administration of different vaccine strains together confers cross-protection against various field isolates in the SPF chicken (Li et al. 2008; Marandino et al. 2015) . Combination of Mass and Conn or Mass and JMK provides higher degree of crossprotection to some heterologous strains. IB 4/91 serotype or IB 274 vaccine virus gives specific protection against IBV. These provide broad protection when combined with Ma5 and IB multi-vaccines (Ma et al. 2012 ). Inactivated vaccines induce higher level of antibody response.",

In North America, Mass, Conn, and Ark serotypes are included in both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. California and Georgia 98 vaccine strains are being used in the United States. Holland variants such as D-274 and D-1466 along with the IB H120-based vaccines are used in most parts of Europe. Live, freeze-dried vaccine serotypes (Ma5 and 4/91) provide long-lasting protection. In Korea, newly evolving IBV recombinants can be controlled by K2 vaccine strain (Lim et al. 2011) . Mass vaccine strain is the only live attenuated vaccine approved in Brazil (Brandao 2010) . Vaccination program involves initial administration of Mass-type vaccine followed by a variant shown to be efficacious against Italy 02 and QX (Jones 2010) . The only vaccine strain used in India is Mass strain 41 (M41). DNA, subunit, and vectored vaccines using S1 glycoprotein gene and reverse genetics vaccines have been identified (Dhama et al. 2008; Lin et al. 2012 ). Protection against two or more serotypes can be achieved through introduction of antigen from two or more viruses in recombinant or vector-based vaccines. These new-generation vaccines can be administered safely in ovo, and efficacy is needed to be tested before introduction for commercial purposes (Matthijs et al. 2003; Brandao 2010; Ullah et al. 2013) . Recombinant IBV vaccine using fowl adenovirus vector backbone expressing the S1 glycoprotein gene provides different levels of protection against homologous challenge (Johnson et al. 2003; Toro et al. 2014) .",

Yan and coworkers attenuated the QX-like IBV strains by continuous passage in chicken embryos for 130 generations, and it was found to be safe and effective for inducing protection against QX-like IBV strains (Yan et al. 2018) . The accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b contribute individually to the pathogenicity of IBV, and deleting any one of these genes results in attenuation of the virus and can be a potential vaccine candidate (Laconi et al. 2018) . Another research team also reported the deletion of accessory genes 3ab and/or 5ab in IBV resulting in attenuation with the ability to induce protection in chickens (van Beurden et al. 2018) . Recently, inactivated IBV vaccine encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles induced an early and stronger IgA and IgG anti-IBV antibodies, when it was vaccinated alone or in association with a live attenuated vaccine (Lopes et al. 2018) .",

Astragalus polysaccharides isolated from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, Astragalus mongholicus, inhibit IBV infection, in vitro, in a dosedependent manner.

Epidemiological surveillance and improved knowledge on the circulating field variants of IBV are necessary for implementing a better control program. Research works are still warranted for improving our understanding on immune response against IBV particularly cellular immunity and a strategic vaccine having capacity to control diverse variants of the virus.",
