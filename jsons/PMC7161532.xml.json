There are several vitamins and trace elements which are essential for the normal functioning of the immune system [1]. Furthermore, supplementation of these have shown positive impact on enhancing immunity in viral infections. Vitamin A and D supplementation have increased the humeral immunity of paediatric patients following influenza vaccination [2]. A high dose Zinc supplementation has shown immune enhancement of patients with torquetenovirus (TTV) [3]. Similarly, Selenium supplementation has shown a positive response after an influenza vaccination challenge [4]. In addition to micronutrients, several herbal and probiotics also have shown effectiveness for treatment and prevention of viral infections [5]. Moreover, several nutraceuticals and probiotics have also shown a supportive role in enhancing immune responses [6,7].",

The increased risk of mortality and morbidity caused by malnutrition is a result of the increased rate of infections, as well as by delayed recovery. Furthermore, infections increase the demand for several nutrients [9]. It is well-recognized that nutrition is a crucial factor in modulating immune homeostasis. Protein-energy malnutrition or even subclinical deficiencies of one micronutrient may impair one's immune responses [10]. Recently, Calder et al. have highlighted the importance of optimal nutritional status to protect against a viral infection [11] and Wu et al. have provided nutritional advices to reduce damages to the lungs from coronavirus and other lung infections [12]. Acknowledging both these valuable reviews, we used a systematic searching strategy and evaluated the highest quality evidence from clinical trials for both the prevention and treatment of viral diseases by means of nutritional interventions. Priority has been given for supplementation of vitamins, trace-elements, nutraceuticals and probiotics.",

Following data were extracted from the included articles by one author (PS) by using a standardized form. A second author checked the accuracy of the data extracted (RJ), and discrepancies were corrected by the involvement of a third author where necessary (PR). The following information was extracted from each study: a) details of the study (study setting, year of publication and study design), b) study population, sample size (male/female) and age of the subjects in years, c) primary intervention(s) and control group and d) details of the main antiviral outcomes reported. Outcomes evaluated were classified as a) Clinical response \u2013 incidence of disease, duration, severity and symptoms or b) Immunological response \u2013 cellular changes, serological response, and other relevant immunological phenomenon. These are reported in the relevant tables for vitamins, minerals, nutraceutical and probiotics, for comparison of similar outcomes between interventions. The Jadad scale (0\u20135, where <3 indicates poor quality) was used to assess the methodological quality of the trials included in the review [14]. The Jadad scale score of each included study is reported in the respective tables.",

            "text": "Vitamin D, another fat-soluble vitamin, plays a vital role in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses [17]. Epidemiological data has linked vitamin D deficiency to increased susceptibility to acute viral respiratory infections [18]. Recent reviews evaluating possible mechanisms suggest that vitamin D plays an important modulatory role of the innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections, such as Influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1 and 2, and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [19]. A systematic review on the role of vitamin D in the prevention of acute respiratory infections, which included 39 studies (4 cross-sectional studies, 8 case-control studies, 13 cohort studies and 14 clinical trials), noted that observational studies predominantly reported statistically significant associations between low vitamin D status and increased risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections [20]. However, results from RCTs included in the above systematic review were conflicting, possibly, reflecting heterogeneity in dosing regimens and baseline vitamin D status in study populations [20]. Few RCT have been conducted subsequent to the above systematic review. A study by Aglipay et al. on the effect of high-dose (2000 IU/day) vs. standard-dose (400 IU/day) vitamin D supplementation on viral upper respiratory tract infections did not show any significant difference between the two group [21]. However, only about 1/3 of the study population had vitamin D levels <30 ng/ml. A recent RCT on the impact of vitamin D supplementation on influenza vaccine response in deficient elderly person, showed that it promotes a higher TGF\u03b2 plasma level without improving antibody production, and suggested that supplementation seems to direct the lymphocyte polarization toward a tolerogenic immune response [22]. Similarly in another RCT, a monthly high-dose (100,000 IU/month) vitamin D supplementation reduced the incidence of acute respiratory infections in older long-term care residents, in comparison to a standard dose group (12,000 IU/month) [23]. It is evident that the role of vitamin D supplementation on antiviral immunity against respiratory infections is likely to depend on the vitamin D status of the individual. Furthermore, vitamin D has demonstrated a beneficial effect in other viral infections, for example adding vitamin D to conventional Peg-\u03b1-2b/ribavirin therapy for treatment-na\u00efve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection significantly improved the viral response [24], and a similar effect has also been observed in patients with HCV genotype 2\u20133 [25].",

Similarly, supplementation of vitamin E (200 IU/day) did not have a statistically significant effect on lower respiratory tract infections in elderly nursing home residents [28]. However positive effects of vitamin E have been observed in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in a small pilot RCT, where a significantly higher normalization of liver enzymes and HBV-DNA negativization, was observed in the vitamin E group [29]. Similar results have been observed in a RCT in the paediatric population, where vitamin E treatment resulted in a higher anti-HBe seroconversion and virological response [30].",

Selected vitamins and trace elements support immune function by strengthening epithelial barriers and cellular and humoral immune responses. Supplementations with various combinations of trace-elements and vitamins have shown beneficial effects on the antiviral immune response. A RCT including 725 institutionalized elderly patients, studying delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response, humoral response to influenza vaccine, and infectious morbidity and mortality showed that low-dose supplementation of zinc together with selenium provides an increase to the humoral response after vaccination in comparison to the control group [33]. Antibody titers after influenza vaccine were higher in groups that received trace elements alone or with vitamins, whereas the vitamins only group had significantly lower antibody titers [33]. The number of patients without respiratory tract infections during the study was higher in groups that received trace elements (zinc sulfate and selenium sulfide) [33]. However in another RCT neither daily multivitamin-mineral supplementation nor vitamin E (200 mg/day) showed a favorable effect on incidence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections in well-nourished non-institutionalized elderly [34]. On the contrary, this study noted an increased severity, illness-duration, number of symptoms and restriction of activity in the group supplemented with vitamin E.",

Zinc deficiency has been associated with an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, including viral infections. Studies have shown that the zinc status of an individual is a critical factor that can influence immunity against viral infections, with zinc-deficient populations being at increased risk of acquiring infections, such as HIV or HCV [35]. Few RCTs have evaluated the effect of zinc supplementation on the immune response. A study by Acevedo-Murillo et al. among 103 children (1 month\u20135 years) with pneumonia showed a statically significant clinical improvement (duration of illness, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) in the zinc supplemented group compared to placebo [37]. They also demonstrated an increase in the cytokine response in Th1 pattern (IL-2 and INF-\u03b3) only in the zinc group, with Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) being elevated or remaining high in both groups. Another RCT on oral supplementation of high-dose zinc (150 mg/day) after stem cell transplantation, demonstrated that it enhances thymic function and the output of new CD4+ na\u00efve T cells, helping to prevent the reactivation of TTV [3]. However, a study by Provincial et al. concluded that although prolonged supplementation with zinc (400 mg/day) or zinc + arginine (4 d/day) in the elderly (age 64\u2013100 years) restores zinc plasma concentrations, it is ineffective in inducing or ameliorating the antibody response or number of CD3, CD4 or CD8 lymphocytes after influenza vaccination [38].",

Selenium supplementation resulted in a dose-dependent increase in T-cell proliferation, IL-8 and IL-10. However, positive effects were contrasted by lower granzyme B content of CD8 cells. Furthermore, mucosal flu-specific antibody responses were unaffected by selenium supplementation [4]. A similar lasting 12-weeks RCT showed that selenium supplementation significantly improves selenoprotein W (SEPW1) mRNA, while after an influenza vaccination, a dose dependent increase in selenoprotein S (SEPS1) gene expression was observed [41]. Furthermore, selenium supplementation has also demonstrated effects on the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin response [42]. In this study low-selenium yeast (control group) induced anergy in DTH skin responses and increased counts of NK cells, while DTH skin responses in the high-selenium (treatment) group were normal, suggesting that selenium supplementation blocked the induction of DTH anergy [42].",

Our study found 18 RCTs conducted on nutraceuticals as shown in Table 3\n[[50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]]. All the studies, except the prebiotic study, showed enhanced immune responses after the treatment [52].",

The results of a meta-analysis by Kang et al. implied that probiotics have a modest effect in common cold reduction [7]. Our review found 4 studies on probiotics [[70], [71], [72], [73]], where Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains have been used as treatments (Table 4\n). All these studies have either been found to reduce the severity of infection or to shorten the duration with probiotic supplementation. Three of these studies showed the efficacy of Lactobacillus for treatment of respiratory tract infection of viral origin [[70], [71], [72]]. The remaining study highlighted a significant association between Bifidobacterium and increased immune function and intestinal microbiota in elderly [73].",

In addition to basic hygienic practices, proper dietary and lifestyle behaviors are essential for prevention and treatment of respiratory viral diseases, such as COVID-19. Everyone including self-quarantine patients is encouraged to follow food based dietary guidelines from their respective national governing bodies, in addition to recommendations given below [89]. For example, everyone should consume at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day and all main meals should contain starchy carbohydrate preferably a wholegrain variety. Moreover, two to three portions of meat or equivalent (for vegetarians: pulses and other suitable protein rich foods) should be included on a daily basis [89]. However, taking multi-vitamin-mineral (MVM) supplement for a short period at least during this pandemic many be beneficial, since achieving a well-balanced and varied diet is difficult due to several logistics and financial difficulties during lockdowns or self-quarantine. Furthermore, those who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should take extra precautionary care to improve their energy, protein and micronutrient levels [90]. Ideally, a trained dietician or nutritionist should prescribe diet, after also taking into considering socio-economic factors. In addition to protein and energy malnutrition, the presence of micronutrient deficiency should be early identified and corrected by therapeutic dose of the respective micronutrient. In the absence of the individual micronutrient deficiencies, every malnourished should take a MVM supplement [91]. On the other hand, a patient with excess body weight (BMI>25 kg m\u22122) should lose at least 5% body weight over a period of 12 weeks to improve their immunity [92]. Patients with diabetes mellitus require a varied and balanced diet to maintain blood glucose and enhance immune functions [93], they should give priority to foods with low glycemic index, limit consumption of high fat and starchy or sugary foods, and choose lean protein variety [93]. Micronutrient deficiencies such as Vitamin D and B12 are well documented in the south Asian countries [94].",

Those who have restricted dietary habits such as food allergies, vegetarian of any subtype and those who have chronic diseases are also at a high risk for micronutrient deficiencies [96]. It is safe to consume MVM on a daily basis to optimize nutritional needs and maintain satisfactory immune function [91]. In regards to the global vitamin D deficiency especially in the population of the northern hemisphere during the winter, supplementation of vitamin D (5000IU/daily) may be effective for both high risk e.g. diabetes and obese individuals, and self-quarantined individuals [97]. Toxicity of vitamin D is rare and modestly high doses (2000\u20135000 IU/daily) can be taken for years [98]. The common practice of taking high dose of vitamin C and E found to be inefficient to enhance immunity except vitamin E for viral hepatitis [32,34]. Nearly 1/5 of the world's population is at risk of inadequate zinc intake [99], We may recommend the supplementation of zinc (20mg/daily) for optimal immune function [11].

            "text": "Every patient who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 must be screened for malnutrition on admission using a validated nutrition screening tool (e.g. NRS-2002) [100]. In addition to dietary assessment, they are all required to test for serum vitamin D levels, if facilities are available, it is recommended to assess micronutrient deficiencies. According to serum vitamin D levels, deficient or insufficient patients must receive therapeutic doses of vitamin D according to local guidelines [98]. Other vitamin deficiencies also should be treated accordingly. MVM (1xRDI) can be recommended to most patients with viral infections especially those who have poor dietary intake during the illness [91]. Patients receiving intensive care facilities should be treated by a critical care dietician/nutritionist. Furthermore, some patients may need oral nutrition supplement (ONS) to achieve recommended calories and protein intake. Resting energy expenditure increases by 10% with viral infection, which should be considered and energy intake should be increased 10% during the illness [101]. Among trace elements, zinc (150mg/daily) and selenium (200 \u03bcg/daily) supplementation could be beneficial to improve immunity during viral infections [4,37]. Along with proper energy and nutritional intake, several nutraceuticals and Lactobacillus containing probiotics can be supplemented to improve the immunity of the patients with viral infections [70,72]. Patients with diabetes have severe disease progress and higher mortality [82] therefore it is recommended to provide a personalized diet with help of qualified nutritionist/dietician and hospital catering system [102]. Gupta et al. recently listed clinical consideration for patients with diabetes with respect to COVID-19 [103].",

In the current global context with limited movements, it is difficult to obtain a balanced and varied diet. Therefore, achieving recommended amounts of calories and micronutrient will be a challenge. Selective micronutrient supplementations may be beneficial especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly.",
