The use of mathematical models to describe the dynamics of such diseases was started a long time ago. Kermack and McKendrick (1933) were the first to introduce the mathematical model to analyze the characteristics of epidemic problems. However, this dynamical system approach for epidemiological problems was not so popular until the early 1990s. Some major and recent developments can be found in Diekmann and Heesterbeek (1999), Keeling and Rohani (2008), Makinde (2007), Smith (2008), Thomasey and Martcheva (2008), Okosun et al.

            "text": "In the last couple of decades, there is a rapid advancement of transportation system throughout the globe. People now move from one place to another very quickly, and this quick movement of human is an important driver to spread the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. For instance, in 2003, SARS epidemic occurred in a wide region of Asia including China due to population dispersal. The H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic in 2009 is now considered to have been the fastest moving pandemic in world history (Lipsitch et al. 2009). Recently, Ebola virus also threatened to become epidemic in vast region of Africa mainly due to the incautious movement of human population. Also, in recent past time, we have witnessed the severe outbreak of many emerging infectious diseases including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, Zika, and the very latest addition is novel coronavirus (COVID-19). For these types of diseases, human mobility can influence the disease dynamics mainly in two ways: Movements may cast new pathogens into the susceptible group, or it may enhance the contact rate between the susceptible and infected people. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in China in 2002 and spread to 29 countries; MERS-CoV originated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later, has been identified in 27 countries; and Ebola virus disease began in Sierra Leone in 2014 and spread to several countries via international travel. Presently, novel COVID-19 originated in China and has spread very quickly throughout the globe. Therefore, spatial heterogeneity related to travel is a very important aspect to be considered in infectious disease modeling approach. Some mathematical models on transmission dynamics of infectious diseases due to population dispersal are available in Wang and Mulone (2003), Arino and Van den Driessche (2003), Wang and Zhao (2004), while Wang and Zhao (2005) proposed an age-structured epidemic model and established the conditions of uniform persistence and global extinction of the disease. In the context of developing countries, Cui et al. (2006) proposed a transport-related SIS-type disease model. Later, Wan and Cui (2007) extended this model as an SEIS-type disease model to describe the infection during transportation. However, Meloni et al. (2011) proposed and analyzed a metapopulation model incorporating the mobility of humans. Findlater and Bogoch (2018) studied the effects of human movement, specially via air on the spread of infectious disease. Some other perspective of human movement on the disease dynamics can be found in Wesolowski et al. (2016), Sallah et al. (2017), Kraemer et al. (2019) and the references cited therein. Thus, in recent times, some advancement has been made in developing models with global transportation flows. However, still only a few theoretical and computational approaches have studied the effect of human mobility in the large-scale spreading of the epidemics. But the social and spatial widespread of several infectious diseases demands the re-evaluation and improvement of mathematical models that we use to understand the public health problems throughout the world.",

            "text": "The most important aspect of mathematical epidemiology is to find out the best possible way to control such diseases. From the past epidemic outbreaks for the diseases including pox, cholera, malaria, etc., it can be observed that quarantine and isolation of infected individuals is a very useful control to reduce the level of infection from community (Kar et al. 2013; Jana et al. 2017). In contemporary times, media coverage is also identified as an alternate control measure. People become alert due to media campaign and take necessary precautions to avoid the infectious diseases. The impacts of media on the dynamics of infectious diseases can be found in Sun et al. (2011), Misra et al. (2015). Vaccination is considered as the most important measure in controlling many epidemic diseases including polio, influenza, etc. The use of vaccination on the disease prevalence through different types of compartmental models can be found in Makinde (2007), Buonomo et al. (2008), Kar and Jana (2013a, b), Zhou et al. (2014). Recently, Jana et al. (2016b) proposed an epidemic model of population scattering with vaccination control. However, for any such diseases, treatment of infected individuals is the ultimate control measures to reduce the infection level. Different types of treatment control function and the impact of treatment on the dynamics of diseases are studied well in Wang (2006), Eckalbar and Eckalbar (2011), Jana et al. (2016a) and references therein. But it is observed that the combination of vaccination and treatment is the most efficient way to control such infectious diseases (Kar and Jana 2013a). However, the combined use of vaccination and treatment control still largely remains unexplored.",

Transportation among cities is found to be one of the main factors which affect the outbreak of diseases. In India, there has been accelerated spread of dengue and Chikungunya, both transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, which are particularly well adapted to urbanized areas. India is the country in which the highest prevalence of these two diseases occurs. A range of factors play a role including human mobility among the cities using public transport including bus, trains, air, etc. Thus, the transportation among cities changes the disease dynamics and it motivates us to construct this mathematical model.",

In the recent past, several diseases threaten to become epidemic due to population dispersal. In this perspective, a transport-related epidemic model is very much relevant to study. Jana et al. (2016b) proposed and analyzed an infectious disease model with population dispersal between two cities but the effect of treatment control is neglected in that article. But, treatment is an effective control measure and it is used frequently to control almost every infectious disease. From this perspective, in our present article, we formulate and study the behavior of an SIRS-type epidemic system incorporating the infection during transport with treatment control. All possibilities including (1) no population dispersal, (2) only susceptible population dispersal and finally (3) all classes of population dispersal are considered. It has been established that in each of the different cases, the system possesses a infection-free steady state and two possible endemic equilibria depending on some parametric conditions. The existence and the stability criteria of all the feasible equilibria are discussed. It is further shown that in each of the above three cases, the system undergoes a backward bifurcation. The qualitative behavior of a system with a backward bifurcation differs from that of a system with forward bifurcation. Since these behavior differences are important in planning how to control a disease, it is important to determine whether a system can have backward bifurcation so that proper control measure can be applied. The reason for the occurrence of backward bifurcations is consideration of nonlinear treatment function as observed in Jana et al. (2016a). Two most popular control measures to control the spread of infectious diseases are vaccination and treatment (e.g., medicine, surgery, hospitalization, etc). In the present model system, we use these two control measures, to eradicate the disease. The optimal control problem is designed and solved by Pontryagin\u2019s minimum principle. As expected, we observe from our numerical experiment that the application of control is always a better choice than without controls.",

(2016a), etc., describe the epidemic system through SIR model. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to study the behavior of an SIR-type epidemic system considering population dispersal and joint effect of vaccination and treatment control measures. We have examined the joint impact of vaccination and treatment controls through optimal control strategies. In this regard, cost-effectiveness analysis plays an important role in determining the most effective strategy among the different available strategies. Some researchers including Okosun et al. (2011, 2013), Agusto (2013), etc., have used cost-effectiveness strategy with some great success. As here both the vaccination and treatment control parameters are used optimally, in the process of optimal controlling, one must eager to obtain what is the best strategy among four available strategies, viz. application of no control, only treatment control, only vaccination control and both the controls together. From the cost-effectiveness analysis, it is easy to claim that application of both the control measures optimally gives the best result from the point of view of minimizing the effect of the disease with least cost.",

However, our proposed model can be used to determine the optimal level of treatment and vaccination, possibility of backward bifurcation when the actual model parameters are available. The model with population dispersal proposed in this work is a better model to analyze an epidemic system compared to the mathematical models proposed by Cui et al. (2006), Liu and Takeuchi (2006), etc., in the sense of nonlinear saturated treatment function, optimal vaccination and treatment control, etc. Simulation works of this model deliver a very good approximation toward the SARS outbreak of Hong Kong in 2003. Other researchers such as Denphedtnong et al. (2013) and Jana et al. (2016b) also proposed their models which can be applied to describe SARS in 2003, but in our present work, we have established a good estimation of the epidemic SARS in 2003. Although for modeling purpose, in the present article, the population dispersal is considered between two cities only, but in our future research, we would consider multicity dispersal. Similarly, in our future research, we would also consider the demographic parameters of the cities are of different values and that would increase both the realistic phenomenon and the degree of complexity. But still we expect that our proposed model can be used to describe some infectious diseases which threaten to become epidemic mainly due to population scattering.",
