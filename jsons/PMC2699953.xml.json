Although the specific characteristics of the inflammatory responses and the site of inflammation differ between one disease to another, they always involve recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and changes in structural cells of the lung. Inflammatory responses are associated with an increased expression of a cascade of proteins that includes cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, enzymes, adhesion molecules and receptors. In most cases the increased expression of these proteins is the result of enhanced gene transcription: many of the genes are not expressed in normal cells under resting conditions but they are induced in the inflammatory process in a cell-specific manner. Transcription factors regulate the expression of many genes, including inflammatory genes and play a key role in the pathogenesis of respiratory inflammatory diseases, including COPD (Caramori et al 2004).",

Viral and/or bacterial infection was detected in 78% of COPD exacerbations (29.7% bacterial, 23.3% viral, 25% viral/bacterial co-infection). Infectious exacerbations had longer hospitalizations and greater impairment of several measures of lung function than non-infectious exacerbations. Importantly, exacerbations with co-infection had more marked lung function impairment and longer hospitalizations. Similarly, when COPD exacerbations not requiring hospitalization were evaluated, a greater lung function fall was documented in those patients where both bacterial infection and cold symptoms were present simultaneously (Wilkinson et al 2006). This data suggests that bacterial and viral infections could synergistically cooperate to increase severity of the exacerbations. Whether viral infections can lead to bacteriological exacerbation (of previously colonizing bacteria) is still an open question that deserves properly designed longitudinal studies.",

Antibiotic therapy is already widely used, but not always appropriately, in the treatment of COPD exacerbations (GOLD 2006). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis supports antibiotics only for those patients with COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence who are moderately or severely ill. Analysis restricted to community-based studies did not find any differences between antibiotic and placebo (Ram et al 2006). In asthma, recent study showed a signification reduction of symptoms at exacerbations in those patients receiving telithromycin as compared to placebo. Given that no relationship between bacteriologic status and the response to study treatment was found, the mechanisms of such a benefit remain unclear (Johnston et al 2006). Therefore, (i) there is an urgent need to develop simple clinical or biological markers to identify those patients at highest risk of bacterial infection and who will benefit most from antibiotic therapy, (ii) further studies are needed to evaluate whether novel class of antibiotics can be more effective in the treatment of COPD exacerbations.",

A recent study documented that patients with frequent COPD exacerbation have more frequent episodes of naturally occurring colds as compared to patients with infrequent exacerbations (Hurst et al 2005). These results suggest that COPD subjects with frequent exacerbations may represent a subgroup particularly susceptible to viral infections. Thus, while there is solid evidence of impaired innate (Wark et al 2005; Contoli et al 2006) and possibly acquired (Gern et al 2000; Papadopoulos et al 2002) immune responses to viral infection in asthmatic patients, it is not yet clear whether COPD patients have increased susceptibility to viral infections. Intriguingly patients experiencing frequent colds had a significantly higher exposure to cigarette smoke (Hurst 2005). Recently, using a mouse model of cigarette smoke exposure, it has been demonstrated that cigarette smoke increases susceptibility to viral infections possibly via alteration/inhibition of immune response (Robbins et al 2004).",

One way to overcome these obstacles is the development of a human experimental model that would allow studies to take place under controlled conditions.

The recent availability of a human model of RV-induced COPD exacerbations (Mallia et al 2007) will foster the research and the progress in this important area. In COPD this is so far the only model where a specific etiology has been experimentally proven to induce exacerbation. In this pilot study mild to moderate COPD patients were safely experimentally infected with rhinovirus providing for the fist time that, in in vivo experimental condition, rhinovirus infection in COPD patients is per se sufficient to trigger exacerbations. Lower respiratory tract symptom scores were significantly increased compared to baseline on days 7 to 14, with peak lower respiratory tract symptoms on days 10 and 11. When the individual symptoms were analyzed separately, all five lower respiratory symptom domains (wheeze, cough, sputum production and dyspnea) increased from baseline however the increases were only statistically significant for wheeze, cough and sputum production, but not for dyspnea. In terms of recovery, all symptom domains other than sputum production had recovered to baseline by day 20, however full recovery of sputum production took almost 4 weeks (Mallia et al 2006). This important data suggests that the link between virus-induced COPD exacerbation and increased dyspnea and sputum production is probably very complex and needs dedicated studies for a better comprehension.",

Most of the studies have been performed on human respiratory epithelial cells, which can be directly infected by RV and RSV. Their infection by RV and RSV determines the production of several pro-inflammatory molecules (such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules). Conversely, very few studies have been conducted in vivo on the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-inflammatory derangement induced by respiratory viruses in the airways during COPD exacerbations. Collectively these studies suggest a critical role for several transcription factor families, including the NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and GATA families, in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators after RV and RSV infection. The relative importance of each cell, mediator, signalling pathway and transcription factor will hopefully be clarified in the next few years. The recent development of the first human model of virus induced COPD exacerbation, that has been demonstrated to be feasible and so far, safe, will facilitate identification of novel pharmacological targets that will provide opportunities to develop new treatments for exacerbations of COPD.",
