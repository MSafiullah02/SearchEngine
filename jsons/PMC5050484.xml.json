Either ZEBOV-Makona (n = 4) or SEBOV-Gulu (n = 3) CS (pooled from survivors; ZEBOV-CS was from 6, and SEBOV-CS was from 3) were administered by bolus intravenous infusion (approximately 10 mL) and bolus subcutaneous administration (approximately 60 mL) 3 days after ZEBOV-Makona challenge, while the control animals (n = 2) were not treated. All serum used was administered as a total of approximately 70 mL, split 10 mL and 60 mL for intravenous and subcutaneous administration; this is roughly equivalent to approximately 11 mL/kg, which is twice as much volume than used to treat repatriated ZEBOV-Makona\u2013infected patients [22]. Surviving treated animals received additional treatments of convalescent sera on days 6 and 9 after ZEBOV-Makona challenge. All animals were given physical examinations, and blood was collected at the time of challenge and on days 3, 6, 9, 14, 21, and 28 after ZEBOV-Makona challenge. In addition, all animals were monitored daily and scored for disease progression with an internal filovirus scoring protocol approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch\u2013Galveston (UTMB) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The scoring changes measured from baseline included posture/activity level, attitude/behavior, food and water intake, weight, respiration, and disease manifestations, such as visible rash, hemorrhage, ecchymosis, or flushed skin; scores for each of these conditions increase as severity increases. A score of \u22659 indicated that an animal met criteria for euthanasia.

The SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera were used as an EBOV species control to investigate whether species-specific serum was necessary for treatment. While it is possible that convalescent serum can contain factors other than specific antibodies necessary for therapeutic benefit, we focused on the antibody aspect and assessed both sera for the level of IgG to the following ZEBOV or SEBOV proteins: GP alone or GP, NP, and VP40 in VLPs by ELISA. High titers of IgG that could bind to SEBOV GP were detected in the SEBOV-Gulu sera as compared to minimal levels bound to ZEBOV GP and both VLPs (Figure 1A). Similar levels of IgG that could bind SEBOV and ZEBOV GP were detected in the ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera, whereas the levels of IgG bound to ZEBOV VLPs were high, with levels bound to SEBOV VLPs minimal (Figure 1A). While some cross-reactivity was observed in both sets of sera, each set had higher levels of IgG, indicative of convalescence from each particular species of EBOV; we detected no variation in the IgG titers for the antigens between individual donors, except for the ZEBOV-CS to ZEBOV VLP. Next, the ability of ZEBOV-Makona and SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera to neutralize ZEBOV-Makona was tested by a PRNT50 assay. Only the ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera were able to modestly neutralize ZEBOV-Makona in vitro, with a PRNT50 of 1:40 (Figure 1B). The IgGs in each convalescent sera were further tested for their quality by an avidity assay, using ZEBOV VLPs; there was no appreciable difference between the sera (Figure 1C).\n",

Further analysis of the blood samples revealed changes in liver-associated enzymes (Figure 3A and 3B) and hematologic changes (Figure 3C and 3D) consistent with ZEBOV infection for all animals, with only S-CS-1 resolving these changes. S-CS-1 was also the only animal to be devoid of typical gross pathologic and histopathologic findings and of labeling of ZEBOV antigen by immunohistochemical stain (data not shown).\n",

Considering the data on ZMapp, which targets the ZEBOV GP [5, 24], we decided to further analyze the avidity of the IgG for the ZEBOV GP only, instead of in combination with NP and VP40 in VLPs as done previously (Figure 1C). To investigate the avidity of each convalescent sera to ZEBOV GP, an avidity assay was performed, and intriguingly a slight shift in binding ability of the SEBOV convalescent sera was observed for the pooled donor sera when compared to the pooled ZEBOV convalescent sera (Figure 4A). This shift led us to analyze the avidity of the anti-ZEBOV GP antibodies from each individual donor serum from either donor group. The avidity of each SEBOV serum donor was shifted, showing a similar trend when compared to the ZEBOV serum donor group as compared to the combined donor data. One SEBOV serum donor in particular, S-D-3, had a very marked shift in the avidity assay (Figure 4B).\n",

Three NHPs were infected intramuscularly with 1000 PFU of ZEBOV-Makona and were with either untreated (n = 1) or treated with SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera from the previous study (n = 1; S-CS-2) or a different SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera pool (n = 1; S-CS-3).

            "text": "In late 2014, the WHO released a report supporting the use of experimental treatments for evaluation of their effectiveness against ZEBOV-Makona infection and disease [6]. Convalescent whole-blood or plasma infusions were 2 of the treatments supported for use in clinical trials. Some of this support undoubtedly stemmed from the report of convalescent whole-blood treatment in the 1995 outbreak of ZEBOV-Kikwit infection, in which 7 of 8 treated patients survived [12], although the authors do not claim that the convalescent whole-blood treatment was efficacious. Additionally, another group reported that the likelihood of survival of these 7 treated patients was similar to the survival rate observed for the entire outbreak, as the treatments were initiated at later times after disease onset that were correlated with survival [25]. While these 7 patients survived ZEBOV-Kikwit infection and were treated with convalescent whole blood, the patients were essentially past the stage associated with morbid outcome when treatment occurred, so no therapeutic benefit of the convalescent whole blood could be determined. These observations, however, led to renewed interest in controlled studies involving passive immunotherapy in NHP models of ZEBOV infection. In particular, one study used convalescent whole blood to treat NHPs with no observable beneficial effect [17]. The convalescent whole blood used in this study was obtained from NHPs rechallenged with ZEBOV several years after initial exposure, and therefore the blood may not have had similar characteristics to convalescent whole blood collected at a time closer to the initial exposure. In the current study, we examined the protective effect of convalescent sera obtained about a month after initial ZEBOV exposure, which is consistent with conditions during the recent West African ZEBOV epidemic. In addition, we compared the efficacy of homologous ZEBOV-Makona\u2013specific sera against heterologous SEBOV sera.",

While the SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera had some cross-reactivity to ZEBOV GP, the titer for SEBOV GP in these sera was markedly higher. However, there was cross-reactivity, and with the success of anti-ZEBOV GP IgG treatments [3, 4], which was followed by the development of ZMapp [5], we analyzed whether the sera used herein had differences in the quality of IgG antibody to ZEBOV GP, using an avidity assay. Interestingly, we found that the SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera had better-quality anti-ZEBOV GP IgG, from one donor in particular, than the ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera. We speculated that perhaps the differences in anti-ZEBOV GP avidity accounted for the survival benefit observed and subsequently followed this study up with another study analyzing this same SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera, as well as a different pool of SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera. However, in this follow-up study, the NHPs treated with heterologous SEBOV-Gulu sera did not survive ZEBOV-Makona infection. These data suggest that the survivor in the initial study (Figure 2A) may not have received any protective benefit from the SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera, although a small benefit from the SEBOV-Gulu sera cannot be ruled out in this study either. Importantly, previous studies with the Kikwit variant of ZEBOV in rhesus monkeys showed that, in rare cases, untreated control animals survive challenge [26]. The number of untreated control animals in the newly developed ZEBOV-Makona rhesus monkey model is not high enough at this time to determine whether a very small percentage of untreated control animals can survive.",

It should be noted that all animals were viremic either by infectious virus or viral RNA detection on the day of treatment, which represents a high bar for therapeutic protection for any candidate therapy. This delayed treatment schedule was chosen in part due to the success of ZMapp with initiation of treatment at days 3, 4, or 5 after ZEBOV-Kikwit exposure [5]. The goal of the current study was to test whether viremic NHPs could show reversion of ZEBOV infection when treated with convalescent sera. We conclude that convalescent sera treatment initiated in NHPs at the onset of viremia is not an effective therapeutic, particularly when compared to the recent successes of the small interfering RNA [21] and ZMapp [5] therapeutics at advanced stages of disease. However, it is possible that treatment with convalescent sera at times earlier after exposure and/or using a different treatment regimen may provide protective benefit. Additionally, we used sera in this study, whereas convalescent whole blood or plasma obtained closer to EBOV exposure, as used in the WHO clinical trials [10], may also have protective blood coagulation factors not found in serum. While we cannot conclude that the anti-ZEBOV GP IgG avidity differences in the convalescent sera accounted for the lone survivor we observed, the question of whether only IgG titer, avidity, or a combination of both is sufficient for passive immunotherapy to provide protection is an intriguing one.",
