The types of UV systems covered in this chapter have been addressed in detail in previous chapters and these designs are not revisited here. Instead, this chapter discusses the various applications of UV to the indicated facilities, how they have been applied in the past, what effectiveness they have previously demonstrated, and how new UV systems may be applied to reduce the microbiological hazards associated with each type of facility. Also addressed here are the types of pathogens that are unique to certain facilities and, in particular, nosocomial pathogens and the problem of increasing drug resistance.",

            "text": "The use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in hospitals to control hospital acquired, or nosocomial, infections represents some of the earliest and most important applications of this technology. UVGI has been used for the disinfection of medical equipment, entire rooms, ventilation air, and surgical sites for well over half a century, often with definitive results. New applications are being developed even today and although UVGI is not a total solution to the problem of disease transmission in health care facilities, it can be an effective and economic component of any program designed to reduce hospital-acquired infections. This chapter discusses the various ways in which UVGI systems can be applied in hospitals and related health care facilities, including dental offices, laboratories, and veterinary facilities. Limited mention is made in most health care literature of UVGI, although some recent guidelines have acknowledged its potential effectiveness (CDC 2003, ASHRAE 2008). 10.1007/978-3-642-01999-9_11 can be consulted for more detailed information on the various standards and guidelines that address the use of UVGI in health care facilities. For a complete review of codes and standards for hospital ventilation and air quality see, for example, Kowalski (2006) or ASHRAE (2003).",

Nosocomial infections have proven to be a persistent problem in hospitals and some drug-resistant infections have transitioned from being hospital-acquired to community-acquired, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Nosocomial infections can have complex, multifaceted etiologies that involve one or more routes of transmission and so the solution may involve more than one type of disinfection system (i.e. air disinfection, surface disinfection, water disinfection, equipment disinfection, personnel decontamination, etc.), procedural methods, and formal standards for air quality (Kowalski 2008a).",

Drug resistance is defined in terms of an IC50 value, or the concentration that causes 50% growth inhibition, and resistance is defined as a ten-fold increase in the IC50 value (Andrei et al. 2004, Andersson et al. 2004). The number of microbes that have demonstrated increased drug resistance in recent years is extensive and growing (Kowalski 2007b). The drug resistance of Streptococcal infections, which can cause Scarlet Fever, has increased from 0.8% to 28% in the past decade. MRSA has shown up repeatedly outside hospital settings and has become a contamination problem in athletic environments. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (XTB) has caused a resurgence in TB infections worldwide, and close to a million people die each year from this disease. Strains of multiple drug resistant (MDR) Haemophilus influenzae are being increasingly reported from around the world (Jain and Agarwal 1996). Multidrug resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been recognized among casualties returning from battlefields (Davis et al. 2005). Various fungi can also cause nosocomial infections and unlike viruses and bacteria, most fungi hail from outdoors but can grow indoors (Kowalski and Bahnfleth 1998).",

Evidence exists for airborne nosocomial transmission of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and MRSA (Allen and Green 1987, Farrington et al. 1990, Grieble et al. 1970). Table 17.1 summarizes the various nosocomial microbes that have airborne potential. Most nosocomial infections have been identified as having at least some potential for airborne transmission although most of them are primarily spread by other routes, such as direct contact. These microbes are ranked by estimated order of occurrence and are classified as Contagious, Noncontagious, and Endogenous (present as part of normal human flora). The last column in this table indicates whether or not the microbe has demonstrated any evolving drug resistance. It is clear from this tabulation that drug resistance is a growing and widespread problem and that all three microbial categories, viruses, bacteria, and fungi, have been developing such resistance. As drugs for treating these nosocomial infections become less effective and less available, increasing reliance on engineering methods such as UVGI may be one of the few remaining means of effectively dealing with the problem.\n\n",

Many managers assume that if the design requirements for ventilation are met then the air is sterile, but this is rarely, if ever, the case. Levels of airborne contaminants in ORs are often lower than in the general wards, but not significantly so. For hospital air, WHO recommends the limits of 100 cfu/m3 for bacteria and 50 cfu/m3 for fungi (WHO 1988). There are currently no standards for OR aerobiology in the USA, but the current standard used in China is 200 cfu/m3, while the EU has suggested a limit of 10 cfu/m3, based on the ISO Class 7 cleanroom limit (EU Grade B) used in the pharmaceutical industry and as a target for ultra clean ventilation (UCV) systems (Durmaz et al. 2005, Kowalski 2007a).

Air supplied to ORs, especially through HEPA filters, may be highly disinfected or even sterile, but most of the airborne bacteria hail from the room occupants, including the patient, and so increasing the rates of supply air above design guidelines is an approach that brings diminishing returns, often at high economic cost.

This system includes 8 UV lamps that produce a net average of about 25 \u03bcW/cm2 at operating table height. According to Ritter et al. (2007), this system was able to reduce the surgical site infection rate from 1.77 to 0.5%. The study did not report airborne concentrations of bacteria in the ORs but it is possible that this system could reduce airborne levels significantly, even with personnel present. It is likely that this UV system inhibited both airborne transport and survival of bacteria on surfaces, including microbes that settle on equipment, on personnel and on floors. Since the irradiance of the UV in this system exceeds ACGIH limits, personnel are required to be completely covered, including eye protection, during operating procedures. Systems can be operated for short periods during surgery, but can also be operated for longer periods when the operating room is unoccupied to provide area decontamination between procedures. Figure 17.4 shows a diagram of how the UV lamp fixtures are located relative to the operating table. In older systems, UV lamp fixtures were often hung below the ceiling directly above the operating table.\n\n",

Although the stray irradiance is below ACGIH/NIOSH limits for human safety, the accumulated dose to surfaces over time will provide fairly high levels of disinfection (see 10.1007/978-3-642-01999-9_9).",

Laboratories that handle animals are subject to occupational hazards from a wide variety of infections, especially respiratory infections (Kowalski et al. 2002, Benirschke et al. 1978). In addition to pathogenic disease hazards, laboratory workers can develop allergies from prolonged or chronic exposure to animals (Hunskaar and Fosse 1993).Many species of animal diseases have the ability to transmit to humans or vice versa since the biological and physiological similarities between humans and animals are sufficient to permit such exchanges. Whenever such interspecies transmission occurs, secondary transmissions are rare. Often, such interspecies transmissions occur by direct contact or very close proximity, but airborne transmission is an ever-present possibility. Contact transmissions may be controlled procedurally, but the control of airborne transmission requires engineered systems. Table 17.5 lists the wide variety of zoonoses that can potentially transmit by the airborne route in animal laboratory or other animal facilities (adapted from Kowalski et al. 2002). Most of these pathogens and allergens can also transmit by direct contact and other means, such as ingestion or vie blood contamination. Few of the zoonotic microbes in the list have been evaluated for their UV susceptibility, but most of them are sufficiently physiologically similar to various human pathogens that the UV rate constants for the human pathogenic species may be used as an approximation. Genomic analysis of UV susceptibility is also possible (Kowalski et al. 2009).\n\n",
