            "text": "Who should decide and judge who is admitted to this exclusive \"Hall of Fame\" or pantheon of the best black physicians of all time? Several lists have been offered in the past by a variety of authors; I believe that all have had merit, but all have raised complaints of being too exclusive or unfair. In this instance, I will take the responsibility of putting forth my own list, which is based upon the tenets articulated above. I realize that it may not contain the names of all who should be so honored, but in its defense, let me explain that it is not my intention to be all-inclusive, which is impossible in any event. I simply want to make certain that the majority of those whom I have determined, based on my research, are deserving are represented here, so that the worthy deeds of so many African American physicians and their exploits do not continue to be unrecognized. This is also not a final list by any means; obviously, there can be additions as time goes by, and, judging by the outstanding accomplishments that they have made over the past 400 years in assisting in and protecting the very survival of the black race, their proud tradition will continue into the future. That is the true legacy of blacks in medicine. 60. Edward C. Mazique, MD (1911 MD ( -1987 Angeles. Research focuses on biology of blood-brain barrier and biochemical modulation of the blood-brain tumor barrier, targeted drug delivery, tumor immunology, cancer vaccines, cancer stem cells, microwave tumor ablation, nanotechnology for drug delivery, optical guided surgery for brain tumors, and Alzheimer's retinal imaging. 9. Ludlow B. Creary, MD, MPH (Fig. 6.43 (Fig. 6.58 Biology and former Chief, Division of Women's Health, both at Brigham and Women's Hospital, leading research into furthering our knowledge of biological differences between males and females that also resulted in advances in health policy. Former Grayce A. Young Family Professor of Medicine in Women's Health at Harvard Medical School, a professorship named in honor of her mother, and professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. The first African American to achieve the rank of professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital. A member of the AAAS and of the National Academy of Medicine. As president of Wellesley, she has advanced women's higher education, championing cross-campus efforts to integrate the ideals of inclusive excellence into the academic program and residential life. With a belief that health and wellness are crucial to fulfilling one's potential, she is reimagining how a college integrates a public health agenda as an essential component of a college education. The College is developing new opportunities by drawing on the synergies found at the intersection of science, the humanities, and social sciences. In conclusion, I have made an attempt in this chapter to recognize and give credit to some of the black medical heroes in our country's history. Others are included in other chapters in this book, but I acknowledge that there are still several individuals who are not accounted for. With all respect that is due to them, I give a silent, unwritten tribute to all of them as well as to all who appear on these pages.",
