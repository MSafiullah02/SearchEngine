Importantly, cardiac and kidney disease frequently coexist and together can synergistically modify the risk of major morbidity and premature death and translate into excessive health services use. The \"cardiorenal syndrome\" is generally characterized by the presence of pathophysiological organ \"crosstalk\" between the heart and the kidneys, whereby an acute or chronic injury or decompensation in the function of one organ can precipitate injury or dysfunction to the other. A large body of literature from observational studies and clinical trials has clearly shown that acute/chronic heart disease can directly contribute to and/or accelerate acute/chronic worsening of kidney function and vice versa. Recently, a consensus defi nition and classifi cation scheme for the cardiorenal syndrome was proposed to help standardize its nomenclature with the aim to better understand its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiology, and therapeutic approaches. This classifi cation scheme proposed fi ve distinct \"cardiorenal\" syndrome subtypes (Table 6 .1 ). These subtypes are characterized by important heart-kidney interactions that share a pathophysiological basis, however, have unique discriminating features, in terms of predisposing or precipitating events, risk identifi cation, natural history, and outcomes. In this section, we will focus on the two subtypes of cardiorenal syndrome most likely to be encountered in critical care.",

The reported incidence is highly variable depending on the population at risk being evaluated and the type of procedure performed (i.e., emergent, intravascular, type, and volume of contrast media). The natural history of CI-AKI in many patients may follow an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine with early return to baseline, and these patients would not be expected to fulfi ll the criteria for type III CRS.

This decrement in kidney function can precipitate clinically important and adverse physiological consequences on the normal function of numerous organ systems, in particular the lung [ 1 ] . The accumulation of uremic compounds is known to contribute to lung infl ammation and injury and has been termed uremic pneumonitis . However, this complication of AKI is rarely seen due to earlier initiation and more intensive application of RRT [ 11 ] . Metabolic derangement in AKI, such as abnormalities in serum phosphate and calcium level and metabolic acidosis, may also contribute to respiratory muscle weakness and dysfunction [ 12 ] . Perhaps the most common lifethreatening pulmonary complication associated with AKI is alveolar edema. Expansion of extracellular volume can contribute to increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. This coupled with alterations to pulmonary microvascular permeability and reduced serum oncotic pressure can predispose to rapid increases in extravascular lung water [ 13 ] . AKI can also contribute to lowering the threshold for accumulation of extravascular lung water [ 14 ] along with impaired clearance of alveolar fl uid once present. Indeed, lung injury in AKI can occur in the absence of overt volume overload [ 15 ] . This is due, in part, to the downregulation of epithelial sodium transporters (ENaC), sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatases (Na-K-ATPase), and aquaporins at the alveolar-capillary barrier. In further support of the hypothesis that lung injury in AKI represents more than alveolar edema, experimental models of ischemic-/reperfusion-induced AKI have shown lung injury that is characterized by not only pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema but also focal alveolar hemorrhage and infl ammatory cell infi ltrate [ 16 ] . Indeed, the systemic infl ammation incited by AKI, including the release and reduced clearance of proinfl ammatory mediators, is an important mechanism contributing to acute lung injury. Moreover, the magnitude of AKI, both in terms of severity and duration, can also modify the intensity of lung injury. Naturally, this organ crosstalk and associated clinical complications may be aggravated in critical illness due to concurrent widespread systemic infl ammation (i.e., sepsis, major trauma) and diminished baseline physiological reserve due to preexisting chronic lung, cardiac, or kidney disease and in response to resuscitation (i.e., large-volume resuscitation). Among patients receiving mechanical ventilation, the development of AKI has been associated with impaired or delayed weaning, higher likelihood of tracheostomy, and prolongation of ICU stay [ 17 ] . Those patients developing lung injury and respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation, concurrent with or following an episode of AKI, have worse outcome and increased risk of mortality [ 18 , 19 ].",

The exact mechanisms by which hypoxemia contributes to AKI are incompletely understood and, however, are likely multifactorial and relate to altered cardiovascular function, renal microcirculatory dysfunction, neuro-hormonal activation, and circulating systemic infl ammatory mediators [ 20 ] . Small clinical studies have suggested that hypoxemia may impair renal autoregulation and glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) and contribute to sodium and water retention, while reversal of hypoxemia may improve renal blood fl ow (RBF) [ 21 , 22 ] . Hypercapnea has also been associated with impaired kidney function, attributed to alterations in RBF and renovascular resistance; however, experimental data have been inconsistent [ 23 ] . Further, acute hypercapnea can also contribute to or worsen existing acidemia. The combined impact of hypoxemia and hypercapnea may act synergistically to impair kidney function [ 24 ] .",

The mechanical disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier from excessive pressure-volume loading during positive pressure ventilation can induce the release of local infl ammatory mediators into the systemic circulation [ 25 ] . This infl ammation due to VILI can contribute to downstream end-organ injury, including AKI [ 26 ] .

First, IAH might lead to a signifi cant decrease in RBF as renal perfusion pressure equals mean arterial pressure minus IAP [ 33 ] . Further, higher intrarenal vascular resistance (organ compression) shunts blood away from the kidneys. This is of particular concern for the renal medulla, which receives only ~12 % of the RBF, exacerbated by neurohumoral activation [ 34 ] . Indeed, AKI through ischemic tubular necrosis is probably the most common complication in the ICU necessitating RRT. Second, the combination of systemic venous congestion and elevated IAP decreases the glomerular fi ltration gradient [ 35 ] . Because the kidney is an encapsulated organ, a pressure rise in the venous system translates into a higher renal interstitial and Bowman's capsular pressure, directly impeding glomerular fi ltration [ 36 , 37 ] . Intriguingly, in advanced heart failure -presumably because of low renal perfusion -the kidneys are extremely sensitive to even small elevations in IAP (8-10 mmHg) [ 38 ] . Moreover, decreasing IAP in such cases, through ultrafi ltration or paracentesis, can dramatically improve renal function [ 38 ] . Extrapolating these fi ndings to the general ICU population, recent evidence suggests that a comprehensive management strategy with appropriate use of an open abdomen in patients at risk signifi cantly improves survival from IAH/ACS [ 39 ] .",

It has been clearly established that bacterial fermentation processes in the large intestines are an important source of tightly protein-bound toxins such as p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate [ 40 ] . Because of this protein binding, such toxins are diffi cult to clear from the circulation, even by means of hemodialysis [ 41 ] . They may accelerate kidney dysfunction, and plasma levels are correlated to all-cause mortality [ 42 , 43 ] . This offers a strong rationale for targeting gut microbiota and toxin production in the bowel compartment with future therapies. In normal circumstances, the gut has an important barrier function, preventing entrance of toxins and microorganisms into the systemic circulation. However, especially when abdominal perfusion is impaired, like in advanced heart failure or patients with IAH, this function might become compromised [ 44 ] . Indeed, it has been shown that the intestinal morphology, permeability, and function are substantially altered in heart failure [ 45 , 46 ] . Consequently, leakage of lipopolysaccharides in the systemic circulation may cause further hemodynamic compromise leading to a detrimental vicious cycle [ 44 , 47 ] . As the ICU clusters, the most vulnerable patients with regard to hemodynamic compromise, kidney and organ dysfunction, this is likely an underrecognized problem and should be an area of further research. Only recently, IAP has been identifi ed as a potential missing link in patients with cardiorenal syndrome, and the term cardio-abdominal-renal syndrome (CARS) was coined [ 44 ] .",

Mortality increases as serum sodium falls, increasing as serum sodium falls from <130 to <120 mmol/L from 11 to 25 % [ 50 ] . Vasopressin release from the hypothalamus, termed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release (SIADH) and leads to water retention by the kidney, is the most common cause of hyponatremia (60-70 %), but cerebral salt wasting, now termed nephrogenic sodium wasting (NSW), may also develop (6-10 %). Both conditions cause hyponatremia, and although physical examination may help to discriminate between these conditions, with SIADH patients typically being euvolemic [ 51 ] and those with NSW having signs of extracellular volume depletion, in clinical practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between these conditions and, in a small proportion of cases, both conditions may be present (5 %). Similarly biochemical investigation may also be unhelpful as both conditions will have a reduced serum osmolality (<285 mOsmo/ kg), with a relatively increased urinary sodium (>25 mmol/l) and urinary osmolality (>200 mOsmo/kg) (Fig. 6.1 ) . However, patients with NSW should have increased urea, creatinine, and hematocrit due to intravascular volume depletion, whereas they should be normal or lowered in SIADH due to relative water retention [ 52 ] . In both conditions serum urate is typically reduced. It is important to make the correct diagnosis as instituting the standard treatment for SIADH, namely, water restriction and ",

Increasing osmolality and infl ammation as renal failure progressively leads to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. In addition, kidney failure leads to the accumulation of the waste products of nitrogen metabolism, with organic acids accumulating in the brain, resulting in changes in both neuronal intracellular osmolality and neurotransmitter levels [ 57 ] . So, if untreated, patients become encephalopathic with classic slow wave brain electrical activity (loss of alpha and beta waves, with predominance of theta and delta wave activity) [ 58 ] (Fig. 6. 2 ). Patients with kidney failure are at greater risk of drug-induced encephalopathy, as many drugs are transported from the brain by organic acid transporters, and due to the competition for these transporters, clearance from the brain is delayed leading to accumulation.",
