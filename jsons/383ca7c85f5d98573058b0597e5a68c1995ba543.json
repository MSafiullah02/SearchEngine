It was not until the work of Dochez and his colleagues at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the 1930s that viruses were considered to be the likely causative agents.' Their work with chimpanzees and human volunteers showed that filtered nasal secretions were able to cause colds in inoculated chimpanzees and isolated volunteers. The next major advance awaited the development of cell culture techniques in the 1950s when Enders showed that poliomyelitis virus could be propagated in human kidney cells. This technique was applied to the isolation of common cold viruses, and in 1956 ECHO 28 (also initially called J.H. or 2060) was isolated in monkey kidney cells;' this virus is now known to be a rhinovirus. By 1965, it was known that as well as rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, myxoviruses (influenza and parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus) and enteroviruses were all causative agents of the common cold. Yet, a substantial proportion of colds seemed not to be due to any of these.",

B814 agent was ether labile and could pass through a bacteria-tight filter. It could reduce the ciliary activity of organ tissue, and could also be detected by virus interference in these organ cultures. At the same time as the Salisbury team were discovering B814, Hamre and Procknow in Chicago were reporting another new virus cultivatable in human embryo kidney cells from nasal secretions collected from a group of medical students in 1962.4 Virus was grown from five individuals, four of whom had been suffering from a cold. One isolate from student specimen 229E was chosen as the prototype strain and further characterised. It was shown to be ether-labile, about 8 9 p m in diameter, and had an RNA genome. Electron microscope examination of both B814 and 229E viruses showed them to be morphologically identical to avian infectious bronchitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus. These Table 1 . All the viruses are host-specific and cause respiratory or gastrointestinal disease, and some are also responsible for disease of the nervous system.

Strain OC43 was isolated from a nasopharyngeal washing by McIntosh and his colleagues in 1966.7 It was one of six strains isolated from patients with colds that had been adapted to grow in human embryonic cell culture. Two of these, OC43 and OC38, were shown to cause an encephalitic illness, manifest as general lethargy, tremors and rigidity in suckling Swiss mice of the CD-1 strain. On the first passage the clinical illness was manifest after 11-15 days post-intracerebral inoculation but this incubation period became progressively shorter after each passage and the illness progressively more severe; after the fourth passage the mice died, 48-60 h after inoculation. Histology showed round cell infiltration of the meninges and perivascular spaces of the cortex. The liver, heart and lungs were unaffected.

The characteristic morphological feature of all coronaviruses is the presence of a fringe of about 200 club-shaped projections of 10-20 nm in length that form the 'corona' that gives the viruses their name. A general representation of a coronavirus is shown in Figure 1 . The various structural components will now be discussed in detail; it should be noted that, despite the wealth of information on the physical components of human coronaviruses, the biological properties of these components have not been extensively investigated and are assumed to be similar to that shown for other coronaviruses; there is much evidence, however, to suggest that this assumption is reasonable. For a detailed review (and references) of the organisation and replication of coronaviruses the reader is referred el~ewhere.~' Human coronaviruses have been noted to have only one type of surface projection, these peplomers are 20 nm long and about 7nm wide at the tip. They are formed by a glycoprotein (termed S) of M , 160 000-200 000. It is thought to be a dimer of two dissimilar proteins, which form tetramers to produce the surface peplomer or spike. The spike can be removed from the rest of the virion by digestion with bromelain, and can then be separated into the district proteins of the dimers by digestion with trypsin. The predicted amino acid sequence of the surface protein from several strains of coronavirus is now available and the general structure seems to be of an N-terminal signal sequence, a membrane-spanning domain, and a Cterminal hydrophilic sequence; there are also a large number of glycosylation sites which in MHV have glucosamine and fucose residues. Mainly on the basis of experiments using specific monoclonal antibodies it is thought that the surface protein is responsible for the binding of the virus to cell surface receptors (and haemadsorption), inducing neutralising antibody, eliciting cell-mediated cytotoxicity, inducing cell fusion and the pH-dependent thermolability of coronaviruses.",

First, coronaviruses show marked tropism for certain cell types. Also attachment of MHV to L2 cells can be abolished by prior treatment of the cells with protease, suggesting an essential protein for binding. Furthermore, results from a Japanese have shown that there is a genetic factor that is important in determining the susceptibility of cells to HCV-229E. In this study HCV-229E was shown to replicate in hybrids of three mouse cell lines (RAG, LM/TK-, A9) and human WI-38 cells. The virus would not, however, replicate in hybrids that lacked the qll-qter region of human chromosome 15, suggesting the production of some protein that is important for susceptibility to HCV-229E, conceivably a receptor. This receptor protein has recently been identified4' as human aminopeptidase N. This protein is a cell-surface metalloprotease that can be found on lung, intestinal and kidney epithelial cells. This further strengthens the relationship between TGEV and HCV-229E as the former uses the porcine aminopeptidase N as a receptor. HCV-OC43 does not bind to this protein but recognises receptors containing sialic acid similar to those recognised by influenza c .~~ Once attached, the virus enters the cell and then uncoats; there are little data on this stage of virus replication. Electron microscope studies have suggested that some coronaviruses may enter the cell via clathrin-coated pits. After uncoating, the rest of the viral replication cycle takes place entirely in the cytoplasm. The RNA genome of coronaviruses contains 5 to 7 open reading frames for the production of a series of subgenomic mRNAs. The positive-stranded genome, initially, serves as a template for the production of a full length negative-stranded intermediate by an RNAdependent RNA polymerase. This polymerase is thought to be coded for by the virus and may be distinct from the polymerase that is responsible for the production of the subgenomic mRNAs that are transcribed from the negative-stranded intermediate. These subgenomic mRNAs are coterminous at the 3' end, have a polyadenylated tail and a common 5' leader sequence. The presence of the leader sequence is explained by the hypothesis that transcription is discontinuous, the RNA polymerase reading the first 60-70 bases of the 3' end of the negative-stranded template then transcribing the appropriate mRNA sequence. The unique region at the 3' end of each mRNA codes for the protein, which is then post-translationally glycosylated. In all the coronaviruses, so far studied, the smallest mRNA codes for the nucleocapsid protein. RNA and protein synthesis take place entirely on internal membranes, the Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum.",

The specific humoral immune response is mainly directed at the surface projection; this has been shown by looking at convalescent sera in volunteers taken 21 days after challenge with the virus, though antibodies directed against the two other major proteins can be found in both humans and rabbits.49 Experiments in volunteers have also shown that both specific IgA in nasal secretions (and also presumably cell-associated IgA), and a high concentration of specific IgG in the serum were both important for the prevention of infection; and for the attenuation of symptoms once the volunteer was infected.

In 1976, a report of intracisternal particles seen in post-mortem tissue sections of the brain of a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient first linked human coronaviruses to demyelinating disease.73 Prior to that it had already been established that murine coronaviruses could induce demyelination in mice. These particles were 55-65 nm in diameter and were found only in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It was because of their morphology and this cytoplasmic location that these particles were tentatively described as coronaviruses. No further evidence was forthcoming until 4 years later, when two coronaviruses, termed SD and SK after the initials of the patients, were isolated from the brains of two patients with multiple sclerosis.74 These were characterised as coronaviruses by electron microscopy. Doubt was cast as to their existence as human viruses, however, as viruses were only recovered after passage in, first, suckling mice brains and then a murine cell line; neither isolate would grow in human cell lines. In defence of the notion that they are human viruses was serological evidence that showed no reactivity of either the mice or the cell lines with polyclonal anti-MHV sera. Moreover, neutralising antibody was found in both CSF and serum of the patients to one or both isolates. It could also be shown by plaque neutralisation and immunoprecipitation studies that the isolates were related antigenically to HCV-OC43 but not HCV-229E; they were also related to the murine strain A59. Later studies have confirmed the serological relationship of SD and SK to HCV-OC43 but also to other murine coronaviruses. The nucleotide sequences of both SD and SK have now been compared with MHV-A59 and they share extensive homology with this strain but not with other murine, or human, coronaviruses. Serological surveys of multiple sclerosis patients have not, with one or two exceptions, supported the relationship between coronaviruses and multiple sclerosis but there are other data that suggest the hypothesis should not be dismissed. Intrathecal antibody, reactive with both HCV-OC43 and HCV-229E, has been found in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients more frequently than in sex-matched and agematched controls.76 This is not necessarily indicative of coronaviruses being aetiologically related to the disease, however, since intrathecal synthesis of antibody to a number of viruses has been shown in multiple sclerosis patients and it may just be a feature of the autoimmune nature of the disorder.",

Corroboratory evidence has come from cell culture studies in which it has been shown that HCV-OC43 can cause a persistent infection in a human glioblastoma cell line, and thus exhibits neur~tropism;~' it has also been shown that human fetal brain cells are susceptible to HCV-OC43 but without the production of infectious virus.

In support of the relationship of HCV-229E with multiple sclerosis is the finding that a sequence of five amino acids, predicted from the nucleotide sequence of gene 4, is homologous with an immunologically important region of human myelin basic protein. 35 CVLPs have been found in the sera of patients with chronic active hepatitis who had no other known aetiological agent detectable,\" such as the hepatitis B virus.

This study has not been consistently supported, and in any case is unlikely to be of major benefit in coronavirus colds, if it is true that the mechanism of action of zinc is inhibition of post-translational viral polypeptide cleavage. Interferon alpha has been shown in a double blind, placebo-controlled trial to reduce the severity of the clinical illness and reduce viral shedding times in volunteers with HCV-229E colds. The presence of side-effects in treating such a mild illness is, however, ~nacceptable.'~ The application of moist hot air to the nares to raise the mucosal temperature to 43\u00b0C initially showed promise as an effective means of reducing the severity of natural colds. This initial promise has not been substantiated but further work needs to be done.s6",

One means of acquiring these is by the development of transgenic animals, though this will still have the drawback of not, necessarily, reflecting the human situation. The best model system must still be the human volunteer and it is hoped that such research will continue in the future.",

This makes the virus difficult to passage to high titres; similar results have been shown in L132 and HeLa cells. Another investigated property of HCV-OC43, is the ability of this virus to haemagglutinate human group 0, chicken, mouse, rat and vervet monkey erythrocyte^.^' This haemagglutination can be reversed by heating, as well as pre-treatment of thevirus with trypsin, etherand Tween-80. The property of temperature-dependent haemagglutination has been exploited in purification of the virus. HCV-OC43 also nonspecifically haemadsorbs to rat and mouse erythrocytes if the virus has been grown in BSC-I, HEV, MK or WI-38 cell culture. This nonspecific haemadsorption is due to the presence of a high-density lipoprotein inhibitor in fetal calf serum. HCV-229E has not been shown to have haemagglutinating properties, despite the presence of the HE protein. It does, however, adhere to sheep red cells treated with tannic acid and this property has been used to develop an indirect haemagglutination test.4z",
