Conversely, patients with a CFS score greater than 5 are less likely to benefit from such treatment. Early discussion regarding resuscitation is also warranted; patients with a CFS score greater than 5 are less likely to benefit (18) . Clinicians can supplement the CFS score with their own knowledge of the patient's comorbidities and severity of illness.",

Elevations in acute phase reactants have been noted, with elevated c-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin (19, 26) , consistent with systemic inflammatory response. Other common biomarker derangements noted in the literature include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated liver enzymes (notably without derangements of liver synthetic function), and elevated D-dimer levels (19) (20) (21) 26) . These derangements have been studied for their utility as biomarker predictors of severity of COVID-19 infection.

Elevated d-dimer (>1000 ng/ml) was found to significantly predict in-hospital death, alongside age and SOFA score, with an odds ratio of 18.42 (30) . There is evidence that procalcitonin is commonly normal in patients and elevated levels may indicate secondary super-added bacterial infection (Lippi and Plebani 2020), however the test is not widely available in the UK.",

Prompt recognition and escalation of severe COVID-19 disease allows early intervention. A trial of high-flow nasal oxygen may avoid the need for invasive endotracheal intubation (51) . ARDS lung protection ventilation guidelines are likely to minimise risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (52) . Prone positioning improves lung mechanics and has been shown to improve 90-day mortality in severe ARDS (53) . Fluid management and vasopressors are important in managing septic shock. Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is available at some centres and may be used as a last resort.

Combination treatment also showed significantly increased efficiency in viral elimination, with 100% of patients virologically cured at day 6, versus 12.5% in the control group (p<0.001) (59) . Subsequent studies have disputed the methodology of the aforementioned study, throwing the validity of its results into question (60, 61) . A recent systematic review in February identified twenty-three clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine pending approval or recruiting (62) . Notably, combination use with azithromycin is associated with QT prolongation and so caution must be taken in patients at risk of arrythmias due to comorbidity or polypharmacy (63).",

Public Health England recently published updated guidelines with regards to the use of PPE in secondary care setting (49). Despite intensive research into targeted therapy, supportive measures currently form the basis of management. Supplemental oxygen should be titrated according to pulse oximetry and empirical antibiotics given to cover all likely pathogens of acute respiratory infection.Intravenous fluids should be given conservatively to avoid exacerbation of ARDS, of which noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema is the hallmark feature(16).",
