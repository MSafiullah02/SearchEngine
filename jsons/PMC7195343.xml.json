This includes considerations of medical urgency, likelihood of finding a suitable organ in the future, waiting list time, first versus repeat transplants, age, and geographical fairness. Medical urgency means that those who are most severely ill should be given highest priority, even if this may reduce overall utility. In addition, a commitment to justice may require prioritization of candidates who have reduced access to the donor pool because of factors such as immunological sensitization. In contrast, waiting list time plays a lesser role when survival is the main determinant of priority. Age in the context of a just distribution of a lifesaving treatment is interpreted as giving priority to those who have passed through \u201cfewer life cycles\u201d (childhood, young adulthood, middle age, and old age).5\n,\n6 Few thoracic transplant centers have operationalized this by defining an upper age limit for transplantation, but in some organ allocation systems, children are given priority. Geographical fairness in thoracic transplantation and MCS is problematic, as organ exchange may be limited by geographical distance (USA) or by regional or national borders.",

An example of such variation is the varying tendency to give priority to transplant candidates who are treated with Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).16 During the pandemic, however, considerations of efficiency may carry considerable weight, depending on local resources during the various stages of the pandemic. For instance, if critical care capacity is scarce, a patient considered in urgent need for transplant or MCS, but will likely have a complicated post-transplant course may not be given priority. Similarly, while MCS implants in ambulatory, non-inotrope dependent patients and even stable inotrope-dependent patients may be safely deferred, the resource need of patients with unstable disease severity should be considered in the interest of an overall efficient use of limited resources.17 Thus, patients who may be predicted to have lesser likelihood of requiring limited resources (such as ECMO or dialysis) may be given priority. Conversely, if a patient in critical care is transplanted or receives MCS, it may liberate resources and be counted as a benefit.",

Strategies to minimize exposure should be implemented, but depending on the stage of the pandemic, organ procurement may still involve risk of contagion, especially as lung retrieval and transplant is considered an aerosol generating procedure. It is important to consider this when considering a donor offer. Furthermore, the highly specialized nature of thoracic transplant and MCS means that some HCW are difficult to replace in case of infection or quarantine. This may have significant collateral consequences for other patients and should be considered under a commitment to maximize overall benefit of resource expenditure. In particular, many transplant surgeons are also responsible for ECMO and other advanced life-sustaining therapies required to support patients with COVID-19 and should be protected from non-essential disease exposures.",
