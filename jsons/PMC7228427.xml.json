When I was traveling internationally in mid-February\nof this year to attend conferences in Australia, coronavirus was already\non everyone\u2019s mind and a common topic of discussion, but it\nmostly seemed to be a distant problem only for our scientist colleagues\nin China (or at most, from East Asia). I could not have imagined that\nwe would be shutting down lab research activities and working from\nhome in just another month in the small city of Madison, Wisconsin\nin the Midwest of the United States and that those conferences would\nbe the last ones I would attend in the first half of 2020 (or maybe\neven most of this remaining year). But in retrospect, should the emergence\nof this crisis have been so surprising to us given the many dire warnings\nwe have received over the years from our top infectious disease experts\nand global health leaders2 and the several\nrecent, smaller-scale but no less deadly, epidemic outbreaks? As the\ninitial shock and confusion dissipated and the reality and routines\nof staying at home sank in, I began to see the connections between\nthe COVID-19 crisis and the climate change challenge3 that motivates many of us working on renewable energy research\n(Figure 1). No, I am\nnot talking about the noticeable reduction of air pollution and carbon\ndioxide emission due to the shut downs,4 which indeed has been observed and will contribute to the mitigation\nof climate change (though maybe temporarily). Instead, what I mean\nis that there are actually many parallels between the challenges in\nfighting this global pandemic and fighting the climate change in the\nlonger term. This clear and present COVID-19 crisis should serve as\na wake-up call for us to act now and work even harder to prevent a\nclimate crisis. Let me explain:",

Based on\nsuch genetic sequences, the first RNA vaccine was designed and developed\nin the United States within a record two months. The biomedical research\ncommunity not only acted with the utmost sense of urgency but also\nworked collaboratively across the globe.
