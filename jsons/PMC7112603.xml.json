            "text": "Globalisation and urbanisation with increasingly frequent and large-scale movements of humans, animals, and commodities by aviation and water transport has led to the spread of previously geographically-restricted microbes and vectors to distant and isolated places.1 Recent examples of emerging viruses that have spilled over to other continents from their original localities via exportation of travel-related cases include coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), influenza viruses, and Ebola virus.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Moreover, global warming and climate changes have redefined the geographical distributions of important vectors of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as the Aedes mosquitoes, and facilitated the global spread of these viruses. Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), have been introduced (WNV in 1999 and CHIKV in 2013) and/or spread rapidly in the western hemisphere in the past two decades.12 Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that was little known before it caused a large outbreak on Yap Island of the Federated States of Micronesia in 2007.13 Even then, ZIKV was not considered as an important emerging pathogen because clinical disease was generally mild. The recent report of a possible association between ZIKV infection and an epidemic of microcephaly among neonates in Brazil has attracted global attention.14 The rapid spread of ZIKV beyond Africa and Asia to the Americas and Europe, and the potentially novel \u201ccongenital Zika syndrome\u201d outbreak have led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare the ZIKV epidemic as a global public health emergency on 1 February 2016.15 It would therefore be important to review the current knowledge on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, and laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV infection, and most importantly, to formulate clinical management options with special reference to perinatal care and control measures based on comparisons made with other mosquito-borne arboviruses.",

In 1954, ZIKV was isolated from the serum of a 10-year-old Nigerian girl who had fever and headache, implying its role as a possible human pathogen.17 Further virological and/or serological evidence of human ZIKV infection was reported in African (Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, and Gabon) and Asian (India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia) countries.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 ZIKV infection remained relatively restricted geographically with less than 20 sporadic cases reported in these areas in the first 60 years after its discovery.13, 27 In 2007, ZIKV emerged outside Africa and Asia for the first time and caused a major outbreak on Yap Island of the Federated State of Micronesia.13 Over 70% of the Yap residents who were \u22653 years were infected within 4 months.13 The attack rate of ZIKV infection in this outbreak was 14.6 per 1000 residents (range, 3.5\u201321.5 per 1000 residents). Subsequently, another major outbreak was reported in French Polynesia in October 2013. An estimated 30,000 humans (>11% of the French Polynesian population) were infected by ZIKV. ZIKV infection then spread from French Polynesia to other Pacific Islands including New Caledonia, Cook Islands, Vanuatu, and Solomon Islands.27, 28, 29, 30 The first cases of human ZIKV infection in the western hemisphere occurred on Easter Island, Chile, in February 2014, possibly originating from French Polynesia during the annual Tapati festival.31 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the NS5 gene sequence of the Chilean strains had \u226599.8% nucleotide and 100% amino acid identity to the French Polynesian strains.31 The epidemic continued to expand rapidly and autochthonous human cases were reported in many Latin American countries in the ensuing 2 years.32\n",

In addition to the sylvatic (enzootic) transmission cycle between the haematophagous mosquito vectors and susceptible primary vertebrate hosts, the recent large-scale epidemics suggest that ZIKV is also adapting to an urban transmission cycle.52, 53 Among the various mosquito species, Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes appear to be the most important vector for ZIKV transmission, although some Anopheles, Culex, Eretmapodites\u200b, and Mansonia species have also been proposed as possible vectors (Table 2\n).25, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 The animal reservoirs of ZIKV are unclear. Non-human primates including M. mulatta, Cercopithecus aethiops, C. ascanius schmidti, C. mona denti, C. albigena johnstoni, Chlorocebus sabaeus, Colobus abyssinicus, Erythrocebus patas, and Pongo pygmaeus, and other mammals including zebras, elephants, and rodents, have been suggested as possible vertebrate hosts of ZIKV in Africa and Asia, based on virological and/or serological evidence of infection.16, 54, 65, 68, 70, 71, 72\nAe. africanus is the first mosquito species from which ZIKV was isolated, and is likely an important vector in the sylvatic transmission cycle of ZIKV.16, 54 Inoculation of unfiltered supernatant of ZIKV-infected Ae. africanus into mice and rhesus macaques led to clinical disease and/or neutralising antibody response.16, 54\nAe. hensilli is the most commonly found mosquito species on Yap Island, but no virus isolate was made from field-collected mosquitoes to ascertain its role as a vector for ZIKV transmission during the outbreak.67\nAe. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, which have much wider geographical distributions than other Aedes mosquitoes, are considered to be more important vectors in the urban transmission cycle of ZIKV.73 These Aedes mosquitoes are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection in vitro with potential for further transmission after an extrinsic incubation period of 5\u201310 days.58, 63 They bite both indoors and outdoors, and mostly during daytime.74\n",

Like other arboviruses, blood transfusion-related transmission of ZIKV is possible, especially in endemic regions or where blood products obtained from infected travellers immediately returning from endemic regions are used. ZIKV RNA was detected in the blood of 2.8% of the donors in French Polynesia during the epidemic.75 Sexual transmission of ZIKV appears highly probable, especially in patients presenting with haematospermia with infectious viral particles and RNA in semen.76, 77 Notably, no other arboviruses have been associated with haematospermia or isolated from human semen.76 This might further complicate the control of the ZIKV epidemic, since most infected patients are asymptomatic. Inadvertent sexual transmission of ZIKV to the female partner may then lead to virus transmission to the foetus, which may be potentially associated with severe congenital anomalies. Besides transplacental transmission, perinatal transmission of ZIKV may also occur during delivery, via breastfeeding, and/or close contact after birth via exchange of saliva and other bodily fluids. ZIKV RNA could be detected in breast milk and saliva of infected women, although replicative virus particles have not been demonstrated78, 79 Perinatal transmission of other arboviruses, including DENV, CHIKV, WNV, and YFV, has also been reported.80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90 Other suspected routes of transmission of ZIVK infection are those reported for other flaviviruses. These include mucocutaneous exposure to the virus in infected blood or via monkey bite, haemodialysis, or organ transplantation.91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96 Particularly, as ZIKV may be shed in the urine of infected patients for more than 30 days, the risk to recipients of donated kidneys from donors at or returning from endemic areas has to be considered.40, 41, 49, 50, 97 It is unknown whether ZIKV could be transmitted via respiratory droplets as viral RNA could occasionally be detected in nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples.40, 78, 79, 96\n",

It is closely related to Spondweni virus and the 2 viruses represent the only members of their clade within the mosquito-borne cluster of flaviviruses (Fig. 1\n).98, 99 Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ZIKV has likely emerged between 1892 and 1943 in Uganda.66 The two major lineages of ZIKV are the African (subdivided into West and East African) and Asian lineages, which are responsible for causing the majority of infections in Africa and Asia (as well as the Pacific and Americas), respectively.34, 69, 100 The single-stranded RNA genome of ZIKV has a size of 10,794 nucleotides encoding 3419 amino acids, with 2 flanking untranslated regions (5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs) and a single long open reading frame encoding a polyprotein, which is cleaved into capsid (C), precursor of membrane (prM), envelope (E), and 7 non-structural (NS) proteins (5\u2032-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3\u2032).66, 101 Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers targeting the E or NS5 gene is a key laboratory diagnostic tool for ZIKV infection in the recent outbreaks.13, 102, 103 The E protein is a major virion surface protein that is involved in receptor binding and membrane fusion. The domain III of E protein contains a panel of antigenic epitopes that are important targets of serological assays, neutralising antibodies, and vaccines.104, 105 Loss of the N154 glycosylation site in the E protein may be associated with adaptation to mosquito vectors and thus facilitate transmission.66 A single amino acid mutation in the E protein (E1-A226V) of CHIKV has been reported to be associated with increased fitness of the virus in Ae. albopictus and allows CHIKV to disseminate in regions lacking the typical Ae. aegypti vector.106 The recent spread of the Asian lineage of ZIKV to Oceania and the Americas may be associated with significant NS1 codon usage adaptation to human housekeeping genes, which could facilitate viral replication and increase viral titres.107 Mutations in the E and NS1 genes should be detected in ZIKV strains causing the current epidemic.",

            "text": "When an infected Aedes mosquito bites an infected patient, it ingests a blood meal containing ZIKV. As in other flaviviruses, ZIKV likely replicates in the midgut epithelial cells and subsequently the salivary gland cells. After an extrinsic incubation period of 5\u201310 days, ZIKV can be found in the mosquito's saliva which can then infect human.58, 63 Moreover, the virus can likely be vertically transmitted transovarially as other flaviviruses. When the mosquito's saliva containing ZIKV is inoculated into human skin, the virus can infect epidermal keratinocytes, skin fibroblasts in the subcutaneous layer, and the Langerhans cells.108 The keratinocytes and fibroblasts contain AXL, Tyro3, and TIM-1, which can serve as attachment factors or receptors for ZIKV. The Langerhans cells contain DC-SIGN, which can also serve as a receptor for virus entry.108 ZIKV infection of primary skin fibroblasts is associated with the upregulation with TLR3 mRNA expression, and enhanced transcription of RIG-I and MDA5, which are known innate immune responses to RNA virus infection. This is followed by enhanced expression of interferon-alpha and -beta, and their downstream pathways of immune activation. Both types I and II interferons can suppress the viral load of infected cells. Moreover, ZIKV is capable of increasing its replication by the induction of autophagy in host cells. Thus, autophagy inhibitors can decrease the viral load of infected cells.109 Infected cells of human skin explant exhibits cytoplasmic vacuolation, pyknotic nuclei, and oedema in the stratum granulosum.108 After replication in these local tissue cells and the regional lymph nodes, ZIKV may then disseminate from the lymphatics and bloodstream to reach other organs/tissues, including the central nervous system, the skeletal muscles, myocardium, and perhaps transplacentally to the foetus. ZIKV was highly neurotropic in infected suckling mice. The brains of infected suckling mice show neuronal degeneration, cellular infiltration, and softening in the brain with virus replication in astroglial cells and neurons on histopathological examination.16, 54, 110 Moreover, evidence of inflammation in skeletal muscles and myocardium has also been demonstrated in infected suckling mice.111 AXL and Tyro3 are members of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). They are also present in neurons and under the influence of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GrH), which in turn may affect neuronal survival and migration. Furthermore, flaviviruses such as YFV may persist for up to 159 days after intracerebral inoculation in rhesus macaques.112 The neurotropism and persistence of ZIKV may therefore partially explain microcephaly and predominantly neurological complications and foetal anomalies in this suspected entity of congenital ZIKV infection.",

However, some patients may have transient and mild leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia or activated lymphocytes, monocytosis, thrombocytopaenia, and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase, fibrinogen, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate during the viraemic phase.29, 41, 42, 43, 45, 97, 114 Recovery from ZIKV infection is associated with restoration of normal number of peripheral immune cells and normal function of antigen-presenting cells.45 Notably, the clinical manifestations of Zika fever are non-specific and may mimic those seen in infectious diseases caused by other arthropod-borne pathogens, especially DENV and CHIKV. Some suggest that Zika fever may be distinguished from dengue fever and Chikungunya fever by more prominent oedema of the extremities, less severe headache and malaise, and milder degree of thrombocytopaenia seen in the former.13, 115 Moreover, haemorrhagic complications seen in dengue fever have not been reported in Zika fever, and arthralgia in Zika fever is less severe than that in Chikungunya fever.13 However, none of these features are pathognomonic and laboratory confirmation is required to exclude co-infections with these arboviruses and other causes of acute febrile illness in returned travellers from endemic regions, such as malaria.",

Zika fever-related rash usually resolve within the first week, but may last for up to 14 days and may be pruritic.13 Other exanthematous diseases, such as DENV, CHIKV, rubella virus, measles virus, parvovirus B19, adenovirus, enterovirus, and rickettsial infection, should be excluded. The median duration of arthralgia is 3.5 days, but some patients may develop persistent or recurrent arthralgia for more than a month after symptom onset, mimicking the post-infectious chronic arthritis seen in Chikungunya fever and Lyme disease.13, 76 Lymphadenopathies may be present for 2 weeks after symptom onset, and alternative diagnoses such as infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome, Streptococcus pyogenes infection, and toxoplasmosis should be considered in refractory cases.45 A post-infection asthenia appears to be frequent and further investigations may be necessary to determine possible association between ZIKV infection and chronic fatigue syndrome.13, 117, 118 Immune-thrombocytopenic purpura and cardiac complication have also been reported in a few cases.114 Jaundice was observed in patients with virological and/or serological evidence of ZIKV infection in Eastern Nigeria in the 1950s who had co-infections (malaria and microfilaraemia) and a patient with sickle cell anaemia.17, 119\n",

General features included low birth-weight, redundant scalp skin, anasarca, polyhydramnios, and arthrogryposis. Neurological abnormalities included cerebral lesions, polymalformative syndromes, brainstem dysfunction, and absence of swallowing.51 Ophthalmological defects included cataract, asymmetrical eye sizes, intraocular calcifications, macular atrophy (well-defined macular neuroretinal atrophy and/or macular pigment mottling and foveal reflex loss), optic nerve hypoplasia, iris coloboma, and lens subluxation.122, 126, 127 Notably, other features characteristic of intrauterine infections, such as hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and chorioretinitis have not been reported.14 Ultrasonographic examination revealed cerebral atrophy, intracranial calcifications especially over the white matter of frontal lobes, caudate, lentostriatal vessels, cerebellum, or around the lateral and fourth ventricles, dysgenesis of corpus callosum, vermia, and thalami, enlarged cisterna magna, asymmetrical cerebral hemispheres, severe unilateral ventriculomegaly, displacement of the midline, and thinning of the parenchyma on the dilated side, pons and brainstem.14, 51, 121, 128 ZIKV particles and RNA may be detected by electron microscopy and RT-PCR, respectively, in autopsied samples.125\n",

            "text": "Two important questions concerning congenital ZIKV infection remain unanswered. The first question is whether ZIKV is indeed the cause of microcephaly and other congenital anomalies in these patients. Severe consequences have been reported for materno-foetal transmission of other arboviruses, such as dengue virus (preterm delivery, foetal death, low birth-weight, prematurity, acute foetal distress during labour), WNV (chorioretinitis and focal cerebral destruction), and CHIKV (encephalopathy and haemorrhagic fever).80, 82, 86 Preliminary analysis in the current epidemic of microcephaly has not yet completely excluded other infectious or environmental aetiologies.51 Moreover, there is some virological evidence to support the association between congenital ZIKV infection and these anomalies. ZIKV RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in the amniotic fluid of 2 pregnant women whose foetuses had ultrasonographic evidence of microcephaly, in the blood and foetal tissues of a neonate with microcephaly and other congenital anomalies who died within the first 5 min of birth, and in the neonatal brain tissues of a few cases of full-term miscarriages and neonates with microcephaly.14, 51, 121, 125 However, there is still no large-scale prospective cohort or case\u2013control study to demonstrate a causal link between the presence of ZIKV in the foetus and the congenital anomalies after exclusion of other infectious and toxic causes. Some have suggested that the apparent microcephaly surge might be attributable to the intense search for cases due to the heightened awareness of a possible association with the ZIKV outbreak or the use of larvicide.129 Furthermore, detailed investigations for exclusion of other pathogens associated with congenital malformations have only been reported in a small number of cases.14, 125 Microcephaly is well reported in congenital cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, and varicella zoster virus infection. Chorioretinitis and intracranial calcifications are common in congenital cytomegalovirus infection and toxoplasmosis, but the latter is more commonly associated with hydrocephalus. Cataract and cardiac anomalies are characteristic of congenital rubella syndrome, although cataract can also be found in congenital herpes simplex virus infection. Thus, the diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome would depend on the exclusion of these \u201cTORCH\u201d infections in future studies using clinical criteria, histopathological findings, and serological, molecular and conventional cell culture techniques.",

As with other congenital infections, it is possible that the reported cases of microcephaly represent only the tip the iceberg, focussing on the more severely affected patients, and that the timing of infection is likely to be important in determining the severity and outcome of the affected foetus. Early infection during the first or even second trimester may be associated with congenital anomalies or even intrauterine death.14, 125, 130 Indeed, preliminary data suggested that the greatest risk of microcephaly or congenital anomalies in the affected neonates appears to be associated with ZIKV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy.51 Of 35 mothers with infants born with microcephaly, 57% and 14% had a rash during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, respectively.14 Besides neurological defects, cardiac and muscular abnormalities should also be excluded, as suckling mice infected with ZIKV developed evidence of central nervous system infection, myositis and myocarditis.111 Some suspected cases of congenital Zika syndrome developed severe arthrogryposis.14, 51, 121, 128 It is possible that intrauterine ZIKV infections that occur at a later stage of the pregnancy may present differently, either with less severe manifestations, such as mental retardation, sensorineural deafness, and/or ophthalmological lesions, or as full-term miscarriages.14 Neonates with probable perinatal transmission of ZIKV infection appear to have mild disease and favourable outcome.78 Further investigations should be conducted to better define the spectrum of manifestations in different gestational stages of congenital ZIKV infection.",

            "text": "Definitive diagnosis of ZIKV infection requires laboratory confirmation as there are no pathognomonic clinical, biochemical, or radiological features that reliably distinguish Zika fever from other arboviruses, and congenital ZIKV infection from other infective, toxic, or genetic causes of congenital anomalies. Successful isolation of ZIKV in viral culture, the gold-standard of laboratory diagnosis of viral infections, mainly depends on the timing of specimen collection and viral loads in the specimens. ZIKV has been isolated in Vero and Vero E6 cells inoculated with infected patients' serum, urine, and/or semen samples (Table 5\n).40, 75, 77 However, infectious virus particles were not recovered by culture in most specimens with low viral loads. A positive serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M or 4-fold rise in the titre of neutralising antibodies in paired serum samples collected approximately 2 weeks apart also establishes the diagnosis of ZIKV infection. IgM may be detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay on as early as day 3 of symptom onset and may last for over 2 months.40, 49 IgM antibodies to DENV and WNV usually persist for \u22643 months and \u22645 months, respectively.131, 132, 133, 134 The major limitation of these serological tests is possible cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. Neutralising antibodies detected by plaque-reduction neutralisation test may be more specific than IgM detection by ELISA for primary ZIKV infection, but may also have indeterminate results for secondary infection, including patients with previous vaccination against or exposed to other flaviviruses.13, 40, 102, 120 This is especially problematic in areas where there is co-circulation of multiple flaviviruses with the same Aedes mosquito vectors.13, 64, 102, 120 Patients with primary ZIKV infection and past DENV infection are more likely to have higher titre (usually \u22654-fold) of IgM and/or neutralising antibodies against ZIKV than against DENV or other flaviviruses.13, 102 A positive serum DENV NS1 antigen test without serial increase in IgM or the combination of a positive IgM response to DENV and lack of an IgG seroconversion in the convalescent-phase serum sample should prompt the clinician to investigate for another flavivirus such as ZIKV. Moreover, co-infections with other mosquito-borne arboviruses, such as DENV, CHIKV, WNV, and Japanese encephalitis virus, are always possible and should be excluded by more extensive laboratory testing if clinically indicated.",

Adequate rehydration for fluid loss through sweating, vomiting, and insensible losses should be encouraged. Aspirin should be avoided due to the risks of bleeding in those with thrombocytopaenia and developing Reye's syndrome in children less than 12 years of age. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also contraindicated in cases where DENV and CHIKV infections cannot be confidently excluded in order to avoid haemorrhagic complications. Potential neurological complications, especially Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, should be diagnosed promptly to allow early use of intravenous immunoglobulins and/or plasmapheresis.

Systematic mosquito surveillance and control programs should be established and coordinated by health authorities.51 Mass sanitation campaigns to eliminate mosquito breeding sites in household and high-risk areas such as garbage collection points, construction sites, illegal dumping grounds, and invalid car fields should be organised. Mosquitoes should be removed with a radius of at least 400 m around areas with high population densities, such as schools, transport terminals, churches, and healthcare facilities. In areas where autochthonous or imported cases of ZIKV are detected, the use of adulticide through spraying to remove infected adult mosquitoes should be considered. Residents in or travellers to affected areas should stay indoor with air conditioning, window and door screens if possible, wear long sleeves and pants, use permethrin-treated clothing and gear, and use insect repellents when outdoor.140 Most Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents, including N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), should be safe for pregnant and lactating women (20% DEET), and children (10% DEET) aged >2 months.141 Individuals returning from affected areas to non-affected regions should continue to use insect repellents for at least an additional 14 days to prevent local non-infected mosquitoes from the acquisition of virus from the asymptomatically infected returned travellers. This will serve to interrupt the mosquito-human-mosquito transmission chain. Hospitalised laboratory-confirmed cases should be managed in designated wards to avoid mosquito bites. The effects of other novel mosquito-control measures, such as the Wolbachia biological control approach, should be evaluated.142 Other animals such as rodents should also be investigated as potential animal reservoirs and controlled as findings indicate.",

            "text": "Non-vector-borne transmission of ZIKV may be prevented by specific measures (Table 3). Concerning blood transfusion, universal nucleic acid testing of blood donors is recommended. The use of universal primers that can simultaneously detect multiple arboviruses such as DENV and ZIKV should be considered. Temporary discontinuation of blood donation should be considered during an outbreak situation. In non-endemic areas, pre-donation questionnaire to identify donors with recent travel history to regions with reported cases of ZIKV infection and deferral of blood donation from these donors until at least 14 days after returning from affected regions should be implemented. Most transfusion-related transmissions of arboviruses are associated with asymptomatic infections, and symptomatic donors who were RT-PCR-positive for ZIKV usually developed symptoms between 3 and 10 days after blood donation.143 Newer pathogen reduction technologies for blood products should be considered.143 Similarly, donated organs, especially kidneys, from individuals with travel history to affected areas should be tested for ZIKV as the virus may persist in the genitourinary tract for an undetermined period.40, 41, 49, 50, 97 Barrier methods should be used to prevent sexual transmission through infected semen. Male returned travellers should continue the use of condom with pregnant sex partner throughout the whole duration of pregnancy. Future studies should evaluate the duration of virus shedding in semen and the infectiousness of RNA-positive semen samples, in order to determine how long barrier methods should be used by men returning to non-endemic regions. Some regional authorities have advised women to avoid pregnancy until the epidemic is over.144 Pregnant women or those planning for pregnancy should defer travelling to regions with reported cases of ZIKV infection. If such travel was unavoidable, they should strictly comply with personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. Further studies are needed to determine the risk of ZIKV transmission by breast milk and saliva. Other less common transmission routes, including mucocutaneous exposure to infected bodily fluid during laboratory and patient-care procedures, and bites by infected primates should be avoided with strict compliance to infection control measures. In the laboratory setting, ZIKV can be killed by potassium permanganate, ether, and heat (>60 \u00b0C), but it is not effectively neutralised with low concentration (10%) of ethanol.54\n",
