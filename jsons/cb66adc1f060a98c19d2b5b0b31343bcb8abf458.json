Leucocyte activation was evaluated by the expression of \\beta2 integrins and L-selectin by flow cytometry using specific MoAbs; reactive oxygen production (ROS) by chemoluminescence and metalloproteases MMP9 and MMP2 by gelatin zymography. As markers of cell activation and/or apoptosis, microparticles (MP) isolated from plasma were double-stained with annexinV (AV) and cell specific MoAbs against platelets (CD41) or granulocytes (CD15) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Microparticles procoagulant phospholipids were measured by prothrombinase assay. Whole blood and microparticles TF was determined by a specific clotting assay.",

Blood leucocyte activation was demonstrated by:-an up-regulation of \\beta2-integrin expression, -a down-regulation of L-selectin expression, -an increased ROS production. Moreover, pro-MMP2 and 9, possibly released by activated granulocytes were increased in the 5 tested patients with presence of active MMP9 in three. Markers of DIC (thrombocytopenia, decreased FVII and FV levels, presence of soluble fibrin and increased levels of TAT) were observed in 17/18 patients. Whole blood TF was increased in all patients (235\u00b1199 pg/ml, mean \u00b1SD) vs controls (< 40 pg/ml). Compared to healthy controls, the number of AV positive MPs was not increased, but the cellular origin was different, with a significant decrease in platelet MPs (p<0.05) and a significant increase in granulocyte MPs (p<0.05). Furthermore, MPs TF was increased and contributed for a large part to the high procoagulant state. High levels of inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in leucocyte activation leading to down regulation of L-selectin, ROS production and active MMP9. Our results suggest a major role of MPs of granulocyte origin in the TF-dependent procoagulant state that correlates with the severity of the disease.",

Numerous case reports and retrospective studies submitted to a webbased drug surveillance have been published, that record the sucessfull use of rFVIIa to treat lifethreatening haemorrhage in patients without pre-existing coagulation disorders. However, it is unknown whether rFVIIa induces hemostasis in septic patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate clinical efficacy of rFVIIa in septic and non-septic patients with bleeding complications METHODS: Between 09/2001 and 03/2004, 25 adult patients with life-threatening haemorrhage without pre-existing coagulopathy were entered into the study retrospectively. Out of 6 patients with severe sepsis and DIC (known infection and at least 1 organ dysfunction) and 17 non-septic patients with severe bleeding complications due to different reasons, we reviewed coagulation parameters and the amount of transfused blood products prior to and 48 hours after application of rFVIIa. The patients\u00b4s underlying diseases and dosages of administered rFVIIa are illustrated in Table 1 . Relevant thromboembolic complications were recorded RESULTS: Prior to administration of rFVIIa, 17.4 \u00b1 3.3 (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean) units of Red Blood Cells (RBC), 9.7 \u00b1 1.6 units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and 3.2 \u00b1 0.6 units pooled platelets (Plt) were substituted to the non-septic patients. After administration of rFVIIa, significantly less RBC 4.4 \u00b1 1.2 (p<0.01), FFP 3.3 \u00b1 1.6 (p<0.01) and Plt 1.3 \u00b1 0.8 (p<0.05) were transfused. Coagulation analysis demonstrated normalisation of international normal ratio (1.3 \u00b1 0.01 versus 1.1 \u00b1 0.01; p<0.01) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (58 \u00b1 11.0 s vs. 34 \u00b1 2.6 s; p<0.05) after administration of rFVIIa. No differences were detected concerning the platelet count. In the septic-group administration of rFVIIa neither resulted in a reduction of transfused blood products nor in a reversed coagulopathy. Three thromboembolic complications were observed in the non-septic patients. Mortality rate was 29% in the non-septic group vs. 83% in the septic group (p=0.02) ",

Drotrecogin-alpha (activated) or recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) is the only biological agent approved for use in severe sepsis syndrome that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing 28-day all-cause mortality and new data suggests a trend towards longer term survival(2). Very few data in literature report the use of rhAPC in the treatment of ASDM.

Automated gastric tonometry (Tonocap, Datex-Ohmeda, Finland) was used to assess PgCO 2 -PetCO 2 before and after FC (CO 2 gap-1,CO 2 gap-2) . An increased CO 2 gap larger than 20 mmHg can be taken as a threshold value of decreased tissue perfusion.

An increase in SVI of less than 15% was identified as non-responder (NR CONCLUSION: Increased production of gut wall lactate was previously shown to be associated with increased leakage of macromolecules across the gut wall due to gut barrier dysfunction (1). In this study we were able to show that even short and uncomplicated CPB leads to increased gut wall lactate detected by gut luminal microdialysis, indicating gut barrier dysfunction. Simultaneous tonometry proved to be insensitive to these changes. We propose that gut luminal microdialysis in the rectum may be a good method to estimate markers of metabolism and gut barrier dysfunction during surgery and in the critically ill patient. ",

Although MV is a potential treatment for COPD patients with acute exacerbations, most of them were unaware of MV as a possible treatment option for them because discussions about this topic occur infrequently between physicians and patients. They are in favour of participating in health care decision-making with physicians and accepting any therapy that makes them able to keep their quality of life. The patients consider advanced directives as an opportunity to express their preferences in order to be considered when they are not able to communicate with the health care team. CONCLUSION: WH/WD in Ireland is common (69%) and similar to European practice(72%). There was no SDP although the prevalence was 2% in Europe. The increased use of sedation (9%) in association with WD suggests an awareness of patient comfort. Despite only one advance directive, patient wishes were known in 28%. ICU physicians were the primary initiators of EOL discussion (59%) suggesting their important role in ICM practice. The majority (55% v 45%) of EOL decisions were taken during 'office hours'. This is finding warrants further study; it may represent the inexperience of on call personnel or may reflect the complexity of the decision. Despite popular opinion extubation is infrequent and comfort measures tend to be continued. ",

The test breath was the breath during which the NEP was applied, and the preceding expiration served as control. Five test breath separated by periods of quiet breathing were recorded. The expiratory flow-volume loops generated with NEP were compared by superimposition with those obtained during the immediately preceding breaths. The portion of the tidal expiration over which there was no appreciable change in flow with NEP was considered as flow-limited and was expressed as a percentage of the expired control tidal volume (%VT). The module of NEP was replaced by that allowing to measure the P0.1. Five measurements of P0.1 were made, spaced by at least 15 seconds. Gas exchange, P0.1 and EFL under NEP were measured at the 1st , 6th, 24th and 48th hour following extubation. If a limitation of flow was evidenced at a given time, the subsequent measurements were not carried out.

In this setting, the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be a critical component for prognosis. Evidence is accumulating that n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio may influence inflammation, since the eicosanoids formed from n-3 PUFA and those developed from n-6 PUFA have opposite effects upon inflammatory mediators production. In standard artificial nutrition -both in parenteral and in enteral formulas -n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio is quite low (between 1:5 and 1:7), since most nutrients are richer in n-6 than in n-3 PUFA. Though, the most favourable n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio is not yet defined. Our study tested the hypothesis that n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio may modulate inflammatory cytokines production in a cell culture of human pneumocytes exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",

The average blood loss during operation was 350 ml and during first 24 hours was 693 ml. No patient was reoperated because of bleeding. Correction of hypocoagulation was made with FFP in average dose 2 TU (4 case with normal postoperative TEG tracings versus 9 cases with pathological TEG).",

In the second step we identified the first occurrence of simultaneous fullfillmment of at least 2 criteria as the starting point for SIRS. Severe SIRS was defined as SIRS with at least two criteria for organ dysfunction as defined in the SOFA score. We used three categories SIRS, SIRS with low blood pressure (SIRS low BP) and severe SIRS with additinal organ dysfunction (SIRS severe).",

Subsequently it has become accepted practice to start corticosteroid replacement in patients with septic shock following an ACTH stimulation test to determine the presence (non-responder-NR) or absence (responder-R) of \"adrenal insufficiency\". In those patients with \"adequate\" adrenal function, corticosteroids are withheld or withdrawn. It is known that in patients who recover, this \"adrenal insufficiency\" is temporary.

Monitoring in the neuroscience intensive care unit extends our powers of observation in order to detect physiologic abnormalities at a reversible stage. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether standard neuromonitoring (ICP, CPP, SjvO2) can influence the functional outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).METHODS:Ninety eight patients with TBI admitted in our ICU the past three years were investigated for age, preadmission hypoxia and hypotension, severity of injury (GCS, pupil reactivity, CT-Scan grade, ISS), APACHE II-24h and GOS. The patients were divided in 2 groups whether standard neuromonitoring was applied [group A (n=48)] or not [group B (n=48)]. Statistical analysis was performed with independent T-test, Mann-Whitney test and Chi square test.RESULTS:There was no statistically significant difference in terms of preadmission hypoxia and hypotension, time interval to intubation, pupil reactivity at the accident site, upon hospital arrival and ICU admission, CT-scan grade, ISS and APACHE II score between groups. Patients in group B were older but had a better GCS than patients in group A. Comparatively GCS remained better in group B even upon hospital arrival.CONCLUSION:In our study institution of standard neuromonitoring, contributed, through goal directed therapy, in a positive way to the outcome of patients with a lower GCS.

This observational study examines the Irish data from the Ethicus study1 of European ICUs; it details Irish practice, factors influencing the decision making process, and documents therapies WH and WD.METHODS:All the patients who died or had treatment limited at the Mater Hospital ICU (the one Irish participant) from 1/9/1999 to 30/6/2000 were included. Data were collected by senior staff for electronic transmission to the ethicus data centre. Paper copies were analysed for this study. Results are expressed using descriptive statistics.RESULTS:There were 126 deaths (mortality 11%). Complete data were obtained for 122, these are the subjects of the study. An end of life treatment decision was made for 84/122 patients (69%). 44 patients (36%) had therapy WH, 40 (33%) had therapy WD, 26 (21%) had unsuccessful CPR and 12 (10%) were Brain Dead. Shortening the dying process (SDP) was not performed. The median time from ICU admission to death was 2.6 days. WH/WD were more common during the weekdays (46 decisions over 55 hours) than on call (38 decisions over 113 hours). Of 84 patients who had therapy limited, discussion on WH/WD was initiated by the ICU Dr in 59% of cases. 78% of patients had family involvement in the decision. Nursing staff were involved in 98% of decisions. No patient was mentally competent at the time but 28% had their wishes known via family. One had an advance directive. The primary reason for WH/WD was that the patient was unresponsive to maximum therapy (68%). 72% of charts had the treatment decision documented, 28% had no specific documentation. CPR was the main therapy WH (96% of patients), inotropes were the main therapy WD (19% patients). 22 patients had more than one treatment decision.

Pga rose from 4.7\u00b12.3 mmHg to 14.1\u00b16.2 (P<0.001). Peak airway pressure significantly increased with IAH (P<0.001), while blood pressure and heart rate did not change. Pes m increased on average from 3.85\u00b11.5 cmH2O to 6.99\u00b12.9 (P<0.001). However, at IAP of 10 mmHg, Pes m was significantly higher at higher PEEP levels (4.12\u00b11.5 cmH2O, 6.81\u00b11.8, 10.06\u00b11.5 at PEEP 0, 3 and 8 respectively, P<0.001). As shown in the table, Pes exp increased with IAP (P<0.001 within PEEP groups); absolute values were higher with greater PEEP levels. Moreover, even if there was only a trend towards greater values of D Pes with higher levels of PEEP (P=0.078), the greater the IAP the grater D Pes during PEEP (PEEP 3: R2=0.625, PEEP 8: R2=0.696, both P<0.001).CONCLUSION:During IAH, Pes m changes are greater when PEEP levels are higher. This is in part due to the smaller changes of Pes exp at PEEP 0, possibly due to the fact that the lung is free to retract under the cephalic shift of the diaphragm. Moreover, at higher PEEP levels the changes of Pes occurring during tidal volume (D Pes) contribute more to increase Pes m.

Patients who required mechanical ventilation (MV) for 24 hours or more were included. At admission to the ICU patients were randomized in 2 groups: one group was suctioned with CTSS, and another group with OTSS. A throat swab on admission and afterwards twice weekly were taken. Infections were diagnosed according to CDC criteria and classified bassed on throat flora in endogenous and exogenous. The statistical analysis was realized by Chi-square test and t-Student test, and we taken values 0,05 to considere a significant difference.<pRESULTS:A total of 443 patients (210 with CTSS and 233 with OTSS) were included. There were not significant differences between both groups of patients in age, sex, diagnosis groups, mortality, number of aspirations per day and APACHE-II. No significant differences were found in the percentage of patients who developed VAP (20.47% vs. 18.02%) neither in the number of VAP per 1000. At the same time we did not find any differences in the incidence of exogenous VAP (0.95% vs 0.86% patients developed exogenous VAP; and had 0.76 vs 0.67 exogenous VAP per 1000 MV-days). Patient cost per day for the open suction 2.25 $,\u00b11.12 $ vs.11.11\u00b1was less expensive than the closed suction system (2,50 p<0.001).",

Institution of early appropriate antibiotic therapy is associated with improved survival but is challenged by the high occurrence of antibiotic resistant organisms. Knowledge of risk factors for potential antimicrobial resistance is important to optimize empiric antibiotic prescription.METHODS:From 1992 through 2001, we prospectively registered all episodes of bacteremic nosocomial pneumonia (BNP)in our 54-bed, mixed medical-surgical ICU. At our ICU, surveillance cultures (SC) are taken routinely as thrice weekly urinary cultures and oral swabs, once weekly anal swabs and thrice weekly tracheal aspirates in intubated patients. We assessed factors associated with the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in BNP in univariate and multivariate regression analysis.RESULTS:Out of 105 episodes of BNP, 46 (43%) were caused by an antimicrobial resistant pathogen: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 17, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae in 12 and MDR nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli in 17. Factors associated with the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in blood culture isolates in univariate analysis are shown in table 1. In an multivariate analysis, only the presence of a antimicrobial resistant pathogen at any site was independently associated with antimicrobial resistance in blood culture isolates (OR 8.2; 95% CI 3.0-22.8).CONCLUSION:In bacteremic nosocomial pneumonia, antimicrobial resistance is strongly predicted by previous isolation of an antimicrobial resistant pathogen in surveillance cultures from any site.ACCURACY OF 24H DELAYED CULTURES OF FROZEN BAL SAMPLES FOR DIAGNOSING BACTERIAL PNEUMONIADe Lassence A 1 , Hidri N 2 , Chevrel G 1 , Ricard J 1 , Barnaud G 2 , Roux D 1 , Le Miere E 1 , Joly-Guillou M 2 , Dreyfuss D 1 ICU, 2 Microbiology, H\u00f4pial Louis Mourier, Colombes, France INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary specimens are not always suitable 24 hours per day for immediate bacteriologic cultures before initiation of antibiotherapy (AB).",

Alessandra, Alessandria, Italy INTRODUCTION: Bypass surgery in the elderly (age >75 years) results in increased mortality and morbidity, which may be related to the cardiopulmonary bypass system. Avoid CPB may be very usefull in this class of patients. We used propensity score analysis to eliminate differences between groups. METHODS: Between January 1999 and January 2001, 255 patients over 75 years of age, underwent either isolated CPB-CABG (n=154) or OPCABG (n=101) at our institution. Using the propensity score analysis, we have selected two homogenous groups: 41 patients underwent CPB-CABG (Group A) and 78 underwent OPCABG (Group B). RESULTS: Patients operated with CPB had higher in-hospital mortality. (12.2% vs. 1.3% p<0.01 O.R. 9.51 C.I. 95% 1.14-78.73). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of hospital mortality shows as independent protecting factor avoidance of CPB. The incidence of the major post-operative complications was significantly higher in CPB-CABG group. Patients receiving OPCABG had lower rates of perioperative myocardial infarction (2.6% OPCABG versus 14.6% CPB-CABG), postoperative cardiac failure (5.1% versus 26.8%), postoperative renal failure (0% versus 12.2%), postoperative respiratory insufficiency (2.6% versus 14.6%), stroke (0% versus 4.9%). Avoiding CPB use was an independent protecting factor. CONCLUSION: OPCABG is safe in the elderly population and significantly reduces postoperative mortality and morbidity. REFERENCE(S): 1.

The depletion of CD4+ T-lymphocytes was associated with a higher susceptibility to lung infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus in some clinical and experimental studies.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) accounts for 6-11% of all causes of thrombocytopenia. As HIT may be complicated by arterial and venous thrombosis (HITT), alternative anticoagulation is indicated. Fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra\u00ae) is a newly developed synthetic pentasaccharide and acts by selective antithrombin-mediated indirect factor Xa inhibition resulting in subsequent thrombin inhibition. Fondaparinux sodium has no cross-reactivity to heparin and has not induced an immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in non-ICU patients. The elimination is almost exclusively renal. Its major drawback is the increased risk of bleeding, to which patients with MODS are prone. Data on treatment schedules in critically ill patients are non-existent.

This figure fell to 8% by day 7. Muscle relaxants were used for ICP control in 70% of patients on day 1 and in 15% on day 7. Over 50% of individuals developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during their RICU stay.

The most prevalent causes in subgroups were cerebrovascular accidents (30.6%) , drug intoxication (22.35%), and hypoxic-anoxic conditions (11.7%) respectively. The history taking and physical examination were most useful in diagnosis. Computed Tomography (CT) scan plays an important role in diagnosis of structural causes. Lateralizing signs (25%) and Nausea/Vomiting (16.6%) were particularly evident in the presenting symptoms. Prognosis is highly dependent on etiology.

This is of particular interest in patients with a difficult airway in whom intubation with a DLT is contraindicated(2).

CT scan revealed fractured ribs, severe bilateral lung contusion, bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and -percardium. Chest tubes placed in the right thoracic cavity were suggestive of bronchopleural fistula. Bronchoscopy revealed a tear in the right lower lobe bronchus and significant bleeding into the airway. Due to massive leakage, selective ventilation of the left lung was decided. Because of severe mediastinal emphysema, the risk of airway loss during tube exchange seemed high. We decided to perform selective blockade using the WEB. The WEB was inserted through the endotracheal tube together with the fiberscope and endoscopically directed into the right lower lobe bronchus with its cuff proximal to the bronchial tear. Once the cuff was inflated, the bronchopleural fistula closed, and ventilation improved to normal within minutes. The WEB was left in place for 24hrs, and the fistula did not reccur thereafter. The patient's trachea was extubated on day 10, and he was transferred to a peripheral ward on day 12 in good condition.",
