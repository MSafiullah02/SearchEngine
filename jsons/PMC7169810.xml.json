However, several classes of nonprotein coding (nc) RNAs play regulatory roles in diverse biological processes. More recently, the discovery of functional long ncRNAs has expanded our understanding of the roles that RNA can play in the cell. Though several classes of ncRNAs are active players in translation\u2014ribosomal RNAs make up the bulk of the translation machinery while transfer RNAs shuttle amino acids into the ribosome for incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain, there is a growing appreciation of the functional importance of other ncRNA classes as well as noncoding regions of mRNAs. These elements have been shown to be key players in the regulation of gene transcription and translation, epigenetic control, and RNA turnover (Bonasio & Shiekhattar, 2014; Guil & Esteller, 2015; J. T. Lee, 2012).",

Additionally, recent studies have identified highly structured ncRNAs as important regulators in various cellular processes and linked misregulation of ncRNAs to important human diseases (Esteller, 2011). For these reasons, ncRNAs are attracting increased attention in both drug design and intermolecular recognition (Warner, Hajdin, & Weeks, 2018). Structural study of these important RNAs is becoming increasingly necessary to understand how highly structured RNAs function and interact with other RNAs, proteins, and small molecule ligands. Elucidation of three\u2010dimensional structures and conformational landscapes provides detailed information of their regulatory mechanisms.",

Base\u2010pairing, hydrogen bonding, nucleotide accessibility and other secondary structure\u2010related characteristics, can be obtained by treating RNAs with specific chemical reagents (typically dimethyl sulfate [DMS] and/or one or more SHAPE reagents) and probing for the sites of modification by sequencing (Cordero, Kladwang, VanLang, & Das, 2012; Merino, Wilkinson, Coughlan, & Weeks, 2005; Tian & Das, 2016; Weeks, 2010). Reactivity data derived from chemical probing studies can be converted to pseudo free energy terms and then incorporated into a secondary structure prediction algorithms to bolster the quality of the resulting structure predictions (Cordero et al., 2012; Deigan, Li, Mathews, & Weeks, 2009; Reuter & Mathews, 2010). Chemical probing remains the best method for high\u2010throughput analysis of secondary structure within large (even genome\u2010wide) RNAs (Bevilacqua, Ritchey, Su, & Assmann, 2016; Watts et al., 2009; Zubradt et al., 2017). However, chemical probing provides limited insight into RNA tertiary structure (Homan et al., 2014) and only approximations of fast time scale dynamics of the molecule (Gherghe, Shajani, Wilkinson, Varani, & Weeks, 2008).",

Generally, X\u2010ray crystallography is the most widely used method of structure determination for biological macromolecules. Indeed, protein structure elucidation has been overwhelmingly conducted using X\u2010ray crystallography, with approximately 90% of protein structures having been determined using X\u2010ray crystallography (Berman et al., 2000; http://www.rcsb.org). Crystallography, as the name implies, requires the formation of an ordered crystal capable of diffracting X\u2010rays. This necessitates conformational homogeneity within the crystal lattice. Therefore, X\u2010ray crystallography has proven very useful for those RNA molecules that adopt relatively rigid conformation, for instance, riboswitches and catalytic ribozymes (Liberman & Wedekind, 2012; Marcia & Pyle, 2012; Pyle, 2016; Roth & Breaker, 2009; Toor, Keating, Taylor, & Pyle, 2008; Toor, Rajashankar, Keating, & Pyle, 2008). However, many RNA molecules, particularly larger RNAs, are flexible and may sample multiple conformations and thus less likely to crystallize in the absence of stabilizing cofactors like protein binding partners. X\u2010ray crystallography has therefore played an important, but significantly smaller (approximately 60% of RNA structures were determined using X\u2010ray crystallography) role in the three\u2010dimensional structure determination of RNAs relative to proteins (Berman et al., 2000; http://www.rcsb.org).",

Cryo\u2010EM importantly allows for the visualization of dynamic biological processes by direct visualization of biomolecules with multiple structural states (Dong et al., 2019; Nakanishi, Kishikawa, Tamakoshi, Mitsuoka, & Yokoyama, 2018; Roh et al., 2017). However, to date, cryo\u2010EM has largely been applied to protein only or protein\u2010nucleic acid complexes (e.g., the ribosome and spliceosome). Cryo\u2010EM has been used to study the overall size and shape of very large RNAs, reporting at very low resolution on secondary structure and branching pattern of these RNAs (Garmann et al., 2015; Gopal, Zhou, Knobler, & Gelbart, 2012). There are a few structures of relatively small RNAs derived from cryo\u2010EM data, (Baird et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018) but these low resolution density maps harbor limited structural detail requiring higher resolution models determined via other methods to glean mechanistic insight. A recent software developed by the Das lab facilitates the building of RNA coordinates into low resolution cryo\u2010EM density (Kappel et al., 2018). While this technique is described for protein\u2010RNA complex datasets, it is likely applicable to RNA\u2010only density maps.",

(a) Labor intensive. Structure elucidation by NMR spectroscopy requires that most resonances are assigned before beginning any structural analysis. This is a time\u2010consuming process both as it relates to data acquisition and data analysis. (b) Signal overlap. RNAs are built from four nucleotides which have similar chemical structures. This results in a lack of dispersion in the chemical shifts (also known as signal degeneracy). (c) Unfavorable relaxation properties. Large RNA molecules tumble very slowly in solution leading to severe broadening of signals and significant losses in signal intensity. These challenges have generally restricted the size of RNA that can be studied by NMR spectroscopy. Of the RNA structures determined by NMR spectroscopy, the average size is 30 nucleotides with only six structures of RNA larger than 100 nucleotides (nt) (Figure 1) (Berman et al., 2000; http://www.rcsb.org).",

Because NMR is not predicated on growing crystals of the sample, there are no concerns that the structure might be affected by crystal packing or the conditions under which crystals can be grown.

            "text": "One attractive alternative to the traditional heteronuclear experiments is to \u201cedit\u201d a spectrum by the nucleotide\u2010specific incorporation of deuterium atoms throughout the RNA. Using this approach, protons are replaced with deuterium and because deuterium resonates at a different frequency than protons, the signals are not observed in a proton detected 1H\u20101H NOESY spectrum. The spectral complexity is therefore significantly reduced (Figure 2b). In addition to the reduced spectral overlap, incorporation of deuterium limits pathways for 1H\u20101H spin diffusion resulting in narrower line widths. Because this method relies on removing signals rather than separating the signals into a second or third dimension, no one sample contains sufficient structural information (Figure 2b) and many different samples, each with a unique labeling scheme, must be prepared to obtain full sequence coverage of the RNA. This approach is labor intensive and requires considerable resources and spectrometer time. Nevertheless, this method is universally applicable and has been used to study a variety of systems including viral RNAs (D'Souza, Dey, Habib, & Summers, 2004; D'Souza & Summers, 2004; Keane et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2011; Miller, Yildiz, Lo, Wang, & D'Souza, 2014) and tetraloop\u2010receptor complexes (Davis et al., 2005). Notably, this approach was recently used to probe the structure of the 230 kDa HIV 5\u2032 leader and provide insight into its dimerization mechanism (Keane et al., 2016). Partially or fully deuterated ribonucleotide triphosphates (rNTPs) can be purchased or produced in the laboratory using either chemical or enzymatic methods (Huang, Yu, LeProust, & Gao, 1997; Lu et al., 2010; Scott, Tolbert, & Williamson, 2000). rNTPs may be deuterated at nonexchangeable positions within the base and/or the ribose and can subsequently be used in the enzymatic synthesis of RNA using T7 RNA polymerase in place of fully protiated rNTPs (Batey, Battiste, & Williamson, 1995; Batey, Inada, Kujawinski, Puglisi, & Williamson, 1992; Scott et al., 2000).",

Isotopically enriched 13C and 15N rNTPs have widely been used in NMR experiments to study RNA structure, dynamics, and ligand binding (Batey et al., 1995; Nikonowicz et al., 1992). Traditionally, these studies have been applied to relatively small RNAs. The ability to site\u2010specifically incorporate 13C labels within an RNA ribose and/or base makes NMR spectroscopy a powerful tool for dynamics studies of large RNAs, expanding the types of experiments that can be conducted and simplifying analysis (see data acquisition and analysis advancements below). Compared to uniform 13C incorporation, site specific incorporation of 13C labels allows for reduced spectral crowding while eliminating the strong 13C\u201013C scalar couplings thereby increasing signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratios and facilitating direct carbon detection experiments (Alvarado et al., 2014; Longhini et al., 2016; Lukavsky & Puglisi, 2005; Marchant, Bax, & Summers, 2018). Drawing inspiration from earlier synthetic strategies (SantaLucia, Shen, Cai, Lewis, & Tinoco, 1995), the Dayie lab has developed a chemo\u2010enzymatic method to produce isotopically enriched pyrimidines (Alvarado et al., 2014) and purines (Longhini et al., 2016) with different 13C and/or 15N patterns. The incorporation of site specifically labeled nucleotides into large RNAs strongly reduced spectral crowding and removed 13C\u201013C J\u2010coupling, allowing study of large RNAs by TROSY (Pervushin, Riek, Wider, & Wuthrich, 1997) experiments and enabling new method for RNA NOESY assignment with improved signal intensity of C6 and C8 protons. In addition, dynamics studies of RNA could also benefit from using those selectively labeled nucleotides (LeBlanc, Longhini, Tugarinov, & Dayie, 2018).",

However, the ability to incorporate a labeled nucleotide in a position\u2010specific rather than nucleotide\u2010specific manner could also be advantageous. Some complementary biophysical techniques, like fluorescence resonance energy transfer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, require labeling at specific positions rather than uniformly at a nucleotide type throughout the whole molecule. Chemical synthesis is commonly used to make RNAs with position\u2010specific labeling; however, it is generally limited to relatively small RNAs (<60 nt) (Paredes, Evans, & Das, 2011). It is possible to enzymatically ligate several smaller synthetic RNAs together; however, the low efficiency of the ligation reactions limits the overall yield of full\u2010length product. In order to circumvent these issues, the Wang lab developed a hybrid solid\u2010solution phase transcription method, position\u2010selective labeling of RNA (PLOR), that can theoretically synthesize any RNA with labeling at any specific position using commercially available nucleotides (Liu et al., 2015, 2016, 2018). The biggest advantage of this approach over other methods is that it can prepare large selectively labeled RNA samples at a scale appropriate for NMR studies (Liu et al., 2016). The use of PLOR to position\u2010specifically incorporate a labeled nucleotide into a large RNA has many potential benefits including breaking ambiguity in resonance assignments and facilitating the identification of long\u2010range interactions.",

These methods require extensive optimization and troubleshooting and are notorious for low yield of product, although significant improvements have been made to improve the yield, eliminate specific sequence requirements, and streamline the process (Duss et al., 2010). The Allain lab developed a robust and versatile segmental labeling method that uses ribozymes and RNaseH cleavage to generate fragments of RNA for subsequent ligation. This approach was demonstrated on the 72 nucleotide RsmZ RNA, which was fragmented into four components for reassembly in NMR spectral analysis (Duss et al., 2010). This method offers several distinct advantages over other methods for segmental labeling of RNAs. First, this method is flexible\u2014new ligation sites can be introduced by performing the RNaseH cleavage with a new splint\u2010directed site. Second, only two pools of full\u2010length RNA, isotopically labeled and unlabeled, are needed\u2014cloning of subfragments is not necessary. Finally, the cleavage and ligation strategy are efficient even for highly structured RNAs, making this approach virtually universal.",

            "text": "One alternative to traditional enzymatic\u2010based segmental labeling strategies is a fragmentation\u2010based approach that relies on annealing rather than ligation to join the fragments together (Figure 3d). This approach was pioneered in the Summers lab and was a requisite for the unambiguous identification of an unexpected long\u2010range base pairing interaction within the HIV\u20101 packaging signal (Keane et al., 2015). In this work, the authors replaced a hairpin loop with a run of intermolecular C\u2013G base pairs, fragmenting the RNA into two discrete pieces that could be transcribed (and therefore isotopically labeled) independently and annealed together post purification (Keane et al., 2015). A similar approach was used to study a 122 nucleotide transcriptional intermediate of the type I\u2010A 2\u2032\u2010deoxyguanosine\u2010sensing transcriptional riboswitch (Helmling et al., 2017). Here, a similar approach was used, a break in the sequence was introduced by removing a loop; however, a G\u2013C handle was not included and may not be necessary for all sequences (Helmling et al., 2017). This approach is versatile as a fragmentation site can in principle be incorporated at the loop of any hairpin element, which are ubiquitous elements in RNA structures. A caveat to this approach is that individual fragments might form a stable structure that inhibits intermolecular base pairing. This approach might not work for all RNAs or at all hairpin loops and therefore must be rigorously tested to ensure proper formation of the native structure.",

An NMR spectrum that reports on the base pairing within an RNA can serve as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the molecule. Traditionally, hydrogen bonding within small RNAs has been inferred through NOE (through space) correlations of imino protons (Varani, Aboulela, & Allain, 1996; W\u00fcthrich, 1986). Hydrogen bonding can also be identified directly using a scalar coupling HNN\u2010COSY (through bond) experiment (Dingley & Grzesiek, 1998; Pervushin et al., 1998). Additional improvements in sensitivity can be gained by implementation of longitudinal\u2010relaxation\u2010enhancement techniques such as BEST\u2010HNN\u2010COSY experiments which selectively excite only desired nuclei which shortens experimental acquisition time and improves signal:noise (Farjon et al., 2009). However, all of these experiments rely on the detection of the imino proton, a proton that is readily exchangeable with solvent and subject to conformational dynamics at elevated temperatures (Gao & Patel, 1987; J. H. Lee, Jucker, & Pardi, 2008; Wagner, Rinnenthal, Narberhaus, & Schwalbe, 2015). The imino protons of transient base pairs can be broadened beyond detection due to exchange with solvent therefore these experiments are typically conducted at temperatures below room temperature (typically around 10 \u00b0C). Large RNAs are generally not amenable to study at low temperature due to the slower molecular tumbling. Nevertheless, imino assignments have been made for several large RNAs including the 111 nt U2/U6 snRNA complex (Burke, Sashital, Zuo, Wang, & Butcher, 2012), a 67 nt region of the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES (Imai et al., 2016), and the 112 nt adenine riboswitch (Reining et al., 2013).",

Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) provide important orientation restraints and inclusion of these restraints in structure refinement greatly improves the overall accuracy of the structure (Bermejo, Clore, & Schwieters, 2016). RDC measurements are conducted both in the absence and presence of an alignment media (Pf1 phage is common for RNA samples) (Clore, Starich, & Gronenborn, 1998; M. R. Hansen, Hanson, & Pardi, 2000), and are measured on a variety of carbon\u2013hydrogen and/or nitrogen\u2013hydrogen correlations within the base and ribose (M. R. Hansen, Mueller, & Pardi, 1998; Yan, Corpora, Pradhan, & Bushweller, 2002; Zidek, Wu, Feigon, & Sklenar, 2001). RDCs provide important restraints in RNA structure determination; however, slightly fewer than half of NMR\u2010derived medium to large RNA structures (RNAs larger than 50 nt) used RDC measurements in structure refinement (Au et al., 2015; Barnwal et al., 2016; Burke et al., 2012; Cornilescu et al., 2016; D'Souza et al., 2004; Davis et al., 2005; Houck\u2010Loomis et al., 2011; Jain, Morgan, Rife, Salemi, & Tolbert, 2016; Kang, Eichhorn, & Feigon, 2014; N.

The incorporation of 13C into large RNAs results in severe line broadening, limiting the usefulness of this approach for the study of larger RNAs. Marchant et al. developed a new method for recording RDC measurements in large RNAs that capitalizes on the large chemical shift dispersion and narrow line widths of adenosine C2 protons (Marchant et al., 2018). This method requires the preparation of RNA with 15N\u2010adenosine and uses a variable flip angle HMQC to obtain RDC measurements and was applied to the study of a 232 nt element corresponding to the HIV\u20101 Reve response element (Marchant et al., 2018).",

One major strength of NMR spectroscopy is the ability to capture dynamics information, reporting on the local conformational fluctuations at single nucleotide resolution (Bothe et al., 2011; Dethoff, Chugh, et al., 2012). Conformational dynamics of macromolecules occurs over a broad range of time scale, from picosecond to second, and formation of new base pairs in RNA conformational exchange lies in the scale of microsecond to second (Bothe et al., 2011; Rinnenthal et al., 2011). Numerous NMR methods have been developed to investigate biomolecular dynamics at different time scales (Bailor et al., 2007; Kloiber, Spitzer, Tollinger, Konrat, & Kreutz, 2011; Vallurupalli, Sekhar, Yuwen, & Kay, 2017; B.

Recently, the Zhang lab optimized carbon CEST experiments for nucleic acids and applied these methods as well as R1\u03c1 experiments (see below) to the study of a 47 nt fluoride riboswitch (B.

One such RD experiment is the R1\u03c1 experiment (reviewed in Bothe et al., 2011; Palmer & Massi, 2006). R1\u03c1 experiments can provide structural and functional insight for low\u2010populated ESs that have short lifetimes. This approach was used to characterize the dynamics of a 31 nt portion of ribosomal RNA, the A\u2010site, which must dynamically sample multiple conformations to decode a messenger RNA (Dethoff, Petzold, Chugh, Casiano\u2010Negroni, & Al\u2010Hashimi, 2012; A. L. Hansen, Nikolova, Casiano\u2010Negroni, & Al\u2010Hashimi, 2009). R1\u03c1 experiments have also provided insight into the roles of structured RNA elements within the HIV\u20101 genome, including the transactivation response (TAR) element apical loop and the primary dimer initiation site (SL1) (Dethoff, Petzold, et al., 2012). The Al\u2010Hashimi lab characterized the ES of the 14 nt TAR RNA apical loop, in which many of the loop nucleotides are sequestered in base pairing (Dethoff, Petzold, et al., 2012). The sequestration of loop nucleotides in the TAR ES inhibits binding by the viral transactivator protein and human cyclin T1, activating HIV\u20101 genome transcription (Dethoff, Petzold, et al., 2012). The 36 nt SL1 exhibited significant conformational exchange, consistent with not one, but two excited state structures and the authors propose that these ESs play important roles in intermolecular dimerization (Dethoff, Petzold, et al., 2012). Similar to CEST experiments, R1\u03c1 experiments can be carried out using uniformly 15N/13C\u2010labeled or unlabeled (A. L. Hansen et al., 2009) RNAs but have thus far been applied to the study of relatively small RNAs.",

CPMG can help extract parameters like population, life time and chemical shifts of ES in slow and intermediate exchange. Extensive studies have been conducted in protein dynamics by CPMG, but in nucleic acids CPMG study is highly limited due to the intrinsic characteristics of DNA and RNA molecules, such as 13C\u201013C J coupling and signal degeneracy (Johnson & Hoogstraten, 2008; Lundstrom, Hansen, & Kay, 2008). Recently, using nucleotides that are selectively labeled with 13C and/or 15N at specific atom positions (as described above), CPMG was used to study the dynamics of relatively large RNAs including the 59 nt frame\u2010shifting element from a human coronavirus (Longhini et al., 2016).

In fact, studies show that SAXS can be combined with sparse RDC restraints to accurately refine idealized/modeled RNA structures (Grishaev et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Another approach is to refine NMR structures with a cryo\u2010electron microscopy density map. This approach has been applied to both relatively large and small RNAs (Gong, Schwieters, & Tang, 2015; Miyazaki et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018) and will likely be a necessary complement to structural studies as the size of the RNA being investigated increases.",
