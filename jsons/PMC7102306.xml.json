Early reports of disproportionately high mortality in young adults in Mexico [1] followed after various reports of pandemic type A (H1N1) influenza infections with variable disease severity but lower overall mortality than that of the initial Mexican epidemic [2\u20137]. On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the influenza pandemic alert to level 6, the highest level, on the basis of the widespread incidence of H1N1 cases observed globally, while noting that the current pandemic could be characterised as moderate in severity [8]. The virus of this influenza pandemic, the first in the 21st century, appeared to primarily affect children, young adults and pregnant woman, as well as those with underlying lung or cardiac disease conditions [9].",

These measures were pertinent in reaction to the first appearance of the new virus in Europe. In the initial phase of the pandemic in Austria, all cases of H1N1 infection were associated with travel and autochthonous transmission was widely impeded [11], although this might have been due to factors in addition to the control measures [12].",

Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for linear effects and model improvement. We aimed at the most parsimonious model. The Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test was used to assess goodness of model fit for the final model. We used web-based data collection and found considerable item non-response, rendering reasonable multivariate modelling impossible. However, it is reasonable to assume that pathological conditions were reported and that item non-response could be mainly explained by the absence of the specific condition. This is obvious for pathologies observed on chest X-rays and evident for pregnancy, where no input option was provided for male cases. Thus, missing values were not random and it appeared reasonable to assume that they equated to absence of the specific condition and, therefore, were set at zero for the multivariable analysis.",

In our study population, half of the patients were <19 years of age and half of the hospitalisations affected persons under the age of 21 years; only 5.6% were 65 years of age or older. Our findings are in line with the growing volume of literature showing that the age distribution of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza disease was markedly different from that observed in seasonal influenza, where hospitalisation is more common among persons 65 years of age or older and in children under the age of 5 years [21].",

At the Medical University of Salzburg, 62.7% of the physicians and 26.6% of the nursing staff received at least a single dose of the bivalent vaccine Celvapan. At the Medical University of Vienna, comprising 8,955 employees, 3,670 doses of Celvapan were used, which would correspond to 1,835 employees (20.5%) receiving the recommended two doses of the vaccine. This strikingly low vaccination rates resulted from a lack of enthusiasm in the general public and in some healthcare professionals, and highlights the need for effective strategies to counter anti-vaccination messages.",

Presentation with mild or moderate symptoms was frequent among the 15 pregnant women in our series, although rapid clinical progression and deterioration did occur: one woman in the third trimester with diabetes mellitus and respiratory failure required a Caesarean section, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation for 21 days.

In the present analysis, concomitant laboratory-confirmed bacterial pneumonia was reported in only nine patients, the most common pathogen isolated being S. pneumoniae. These findings might lead to the perception that bacterial coinfections played a limited role during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. On the other hand, a recent study on bacterial pneumonia in fatal cases of the pandemic indicates that, as observed during previous influenza pandemics, bacterial pneumonia considerably contributed to death [39]. Thus, a low number of clinically documented bacterial lung infections might reflect the difficulty of establishing specific bacterial diagnoses in persons with suspected bacterial coinfection rather than reflecting a truly low incidence [40]. Accordingly, in the present analysis, 14.6% of the hospitalised patients, 42.9% of the patients requiring intensive care and 38.5% of fatal cases had a clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Our data suggest that bacterial lung infections occurred among patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection and may underline the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia.",

This is in line with other reports of low sensitivity of point-of-care tests for 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection [42, 43]. The sensitivity was higher in children, who shed higher viral loads for longer durations compared with adults [44]. Thus, reliance on the results of rapid tests may be misleading and could result in the delayed diagnosis of H1N1 infection.",

The benefit was, however, modest, with a reduction in the duration of fever of 0.6 days. No benefit in terms of survival could be identified. Nonetheless, antiviral treatment significantly reduced the risk of admission to an ICU. Thus, our data indicate that antiviral treatment may be beneficial for patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1, regardless of the time of symptom onset.",
