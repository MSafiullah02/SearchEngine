Doing so would maximize the benefits for patients that are receiving care through the implementation of ERAS protocols [2]. Enhancing the management of persistent perioperative pain would translate into decreased time in the postanesthesia recovery unit (PACU), reduced opioid consumption, earlier hospital discharge, and improvement in patient satisfaction.",

Dexmedetomidine, therefore, is a crucial component of the multimodal analgesia approach. A large collection of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine to be superior to other agents in the perioperative setting [5\u20138, 9\u2022\u2022, 10, 11\u2022\u2022, 12\u201316]. For example, dexmedetomidine has superior pain control in several types of laparoscopic procedures, such as bariatric and gynecological procedures, and open-surgery approaches, such as colorectal, major spine, and abdominal hysterectomy surgeries. Patients report higher satisfaction scores after dexmedetomidine, which is likely related to decreased pain and decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). For these reasons, many providers opt for using dexmedetomidine as part of multimodal therapy.",

This leads to the suppression of nerve conduction by inhibiting calcium entry required for neurotransmitter vesicle fusion. This negative feedback back loop leads to attenuation of sympathetic response and decreases both heart rate and blood pressure [16]. At the alpha-2 receptor, dexmedetomidine, causes inhibition of norepinephrine release from presynaptic neurons, produces centrally induced sedation via alpha-2 receptors in the locus ceruleus and centrally mediated pain modification via the dorsal horn [16].",

Decreased cardiac output also has impact and leads to reduced dexmedetomidine clearance [17]. Nevertheless, low albumin levels, end organ failure, and hemodynamic changes all are factors to be considered in an ICU patient that can affect the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine.

However, the overall effects of dexmedetomidine on the respiratory system when combined with other anesthetic drugs are minimal. Dexmedetomidine also demonstrates protective effects by attenuating oxidative stress from acute lung injury by inhibiting the generation of ROS (reactive oxidative species).

Dexmedetomidine clearance is about 50% in newborns that eventually matures to adult levels by the end of new neonatal age. Neonates have larger volume of distribution with increased elimination half-life due to liver immaturity and lower albumin levels [14]. Also, a higher concentration of dexmedetomidine is found in neonatal brains due to immature blood-brain barrier. At lower doses, no cardiopulmonary side effects occur but hypothermia and bradycardia have been reported with use of dexmedetomidine in neonates [14]. In older children, dexmedetomidine is well tolerated and efficacy similar to that seen in adults. Analgesia with non-opioids analgesics like dexmedetomidine are being used as part of an ERAS protocol intraoperatively, along with regional nerve blocks to attain a satisfactory postoperative outcome with reduced requirements of opioids in PACU in the pediatric population. With more requests for procedural sedation for diagnostics procedures like MRI, ambulatory center procedures, dexmedetomidine has become an attractive option for non-IV route of sedation especially buccal administration at least 45 min before the elected time in a dose 2 to 3 \u03bcg/kg. This provides adequate sedation in approximately 80% of patients with a failure rate of 20% requiring other modes of sedation [25].",

Caution must be exercised with vigilant cardiopulmonary monitoring when dexmedetomidine is administrated after induction of anesthesia. The data on negative postoperative behavioral changes is limited, but up to 50% children undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia manifest some kind of behavioral symptoms including but not limited to inconsolable crying, irritability, feeding and sleeping issues, temper tantrums, and nightmares that could manifest anywhere from postoperative day to 1 to a week or later after discharge.

Although a recent published study did show that with dexmedetomidine, infusion leads to decreased norepinephrine and epinephrine, suggesting that dexmedetomidine\u2019s effects are primarily by reducing catecholamines and not via anti-inflammatory effects [27]. Dexmedetomidine can also decrease the occurrence of emergence delirium, especially in the pediatric population. It has been found that patients treated with dexmedetomidine had reduced incidence of emergence delirium when compared with midazolam. Even with lorazepam, dexmedetomidine had lower incidence of emergence delirium. Therefore, dexmedetomidine could be used prophylactically or in an emergent setting for the prevention or control of emergence delirium [16]. For patients at risk, a dose of 0.25 mcg/kg of dexmedetomidine may be slowly injected intravenously and to treat patients emergently, a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg of dexmedetomidine may be used [16].",

Dexmedetomidine has a stronger analgesic effect than clonidine and acetaminophen, but weaker than ketamine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [28]. This not only makes dexmedetomidine an attractive agent for ERAS, but also for chronic pain patients [36]. In a 2015 meta-analysis, although dexmedetomidine reduced pain intensity, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), it had no effect on recovery time [29]. Notably, in a Cochrane review of dexmedetomidine use in abdominal surgery, there was too much heterogeneity of the data for meta-analysis [37]. Dexmedetomidine is an effective analgesic for pediatric patients and has the added benefits of reducing anxiety and emergence agitation [9\u2022\u2022, 38\u201340].",

When given preoperatively, a single 1 mcg/kg dose of dexmedetomidine given 10 min prior to induction has been shown to reduce postoperative opioid use [41]. Multiple studies demonstrate the effectiveness of intraoperative dexmedetomidine and it has also been shown to be superior to intraoperative remifentanil, providing better postoperative analgesia with fewer side effects [42\u201346]. In two recent meta-analyses, patients that received postoperative dexmedetomidine infusion and IV opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) had lower postoperative pain scores and lower opioid consumption in the first 24 h postoperatively with decreased PONV and pruritis compared with those with PCA alone [47, 48]. One randomized controlled trial comparing dexmedetomidine PCA with fentanyl PCA for postoperative pain control found that although there was no significant difference in VAS pain score at 6 h postoperatively, the patients with the dexmedetomidine PCA had higher patient satisfaction with pain control, faster return of bsowel function, and a lower incidence of PONV [8]. As most ERAS pathways do not utilize IV opioid PCAs, there may be a limited role for dexmedetomidine PCA. However, it may be an attractive alternative to opioid PCA in patients that require PCA despite other multimodal analgesics.",

The addition of dexmedetomidine to neuraxial analgesia, IV regional anesthesia, and peripheral nerve blocks [51, 52] can hasten block onset, prolongs duration, and reduces opioid use [50, 53]. In a 2017 meta-analysis of over 2000 patients, the addition of dexmedetomidine to brachial plexus blocks led to faster block onset, longer block duration, improved analgesia, and reduced postoperative morphine requirements by 10.2 mg [52]. While dexmedetomidine is effective as an adjunct to regional anesthesia, it is not as effective as dexamethasone and carries a higher risk of hypotension and sedation compared with dexamethasone [54]. This may limit its widespread use as an adjunct to regional anesthetic ERAS pathways and may support its preferential use as an intravenous infusion.",

They reported a reduction of the MAC of sevoflurane (0.6 (0.2) vs. 0.9 (0.1), p = 0.037) needed to achieve adequate sedation, as well as a 60% reduction of pain immediately postop with further reduction lasting until POD 3 [69]. Panchgar et al. had similar results in laparoscopic surgeries with a loading dose of 1 \u03bcg/kg body weight and then a maintenance dose of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/h for the remainder of the procedure. Time to rescue analgesia postoperatively was 50 min in the control group vs. 360 min in the dexmedetomidine group. The total 24-h analgesic need was also significantly less for the dexmedetomidine group (90 mg) vs. the NS control group (195 mg) [70].",

Some studies suggest that this is beneficial in that it curtails hemodynamic stress response generated by the trauma of surgery [69]. Still other studies did not find dexmedetomidine to be superior to other drugs. One such study found that fentanyl provided longer postoperative analgesia than dexmedetomidine when added to lidocaine in women undergoing spinal epidural during elective c-section, although it did have a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting [75] (see Table 2).",

Dexmedetomidine has also been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea, vomiting, delirium, and agitation with minimal effect on respiratory drive [78]. These features make it a valuable tool in achieving the goals of enhanced recovery after surgery. Many of its on and off label uses have been studied. It has been used for sedation in the ICU, as an adjuvant for epidural and peripheral nerve block, and for preprocedure anxiolysis [79].

            "text": "The main adverse event healthcare workers should be cautious of when administering dexmedetomidine is hemodynamic instability, namely bradycardia, hypotension, and hypertension. Song et al. found that patients who received dexmedetomidine intraoperatively had almost a 2-fold increase in bradycardia compared with the control group [57]. Meanwhile, Shariffudin et al. found a significant decrease in the systolic blood pressure at the 15-min mark after infusion. This phenomena disappeared by the 20-min mark and did not return for the remainder of the case [69]. It appears that these episodes of hemodynamic disturbance are associated with the use of a loading dose or fast initial infusion rates. One way to mitigate this is to forgo a loading bolus and instead utilize a slower basal infusion rate. Although these hemodynamic changes do not cause issue for the majority of patients, healthcare providers should use caution when administering dexmedetomidine to patients who are less able to tolerate bradycardia. These might include patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities, those taking medications that alter cardiac conduction, and the elderly [80]. Additionally, care should be taken to adjust the dosing in patients with hepatic impairment, as dexmedetomidine is predominantly metabolized in the liver [14].",

More studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of atipamezole in humans. Gaining approval for human use would make dexmedetomidine an even more attractive option [14]. There is currently a paucity of data addressing the potential neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and renoprotective effects of dexmedetomidine.
