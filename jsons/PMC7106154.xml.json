For example, if the traveler plans to summit Kilimanjaro or visit Cuzco, a cardiac, respiratory, or hematologic history may make this itinerary ill-advised. Issues of altitude illness, although not fully predictable, are often more severe in those with known cardiovascular, respiratory, and hematologic disorders.3 Pregnancy, lactation, and serious conditions requiring close monitoring may make rustic environments inadvisable.",

In 2012, an estimated 627,000 people died of malaria worldwide, disproportionately impacting children in sub-Saharan Africa. In the US, approximately 1,500 to 2,000 cases of malaria are identified annually. Between 1957 and 2011, 63 outbreaks of locally transmitted malaria occurred in the US. These outbreaks were brought into the US by international travelers who were infected abroad, allowing the parasite to be transferred to a new local person through a mosquito bite. Malaria can also spread from mother to unborn child, sharing used needles, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation.7 Symptoms of infection generally occur between 10 days and 4 weeks after infection, although some report symptoms as early as 7 days postinfection or up to 1 year later. Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale can have a remitting and exacerbating symptomatology, which can further complicate diagnosis. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, back pain, headache, anemia, jaundice, neurologic changes including dizziness and confusion, and coma leading to death if not properly identified and treated. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi are considered the most lethal of all known human Plasmodium species with a rapid progressive illness pattern that quickly deteriorates to neurologic symptoms and death.",

One negative blood smear does not preclude the diagnosis of malaria, but rather repeat smears should be completed every 12-24 hours for a total of 3 sets. If three sets of smears, prepared and read by a qualified technologist, are read as negative, the diagnosis of malaria can be ruled out. If Plasmodium is identified on stained smears, the parasite density should be estimated via microscopy.

YF is a live vaccine and should not be given to pregnant women; children under the age of 6 months; or anyone with an immune-altering condition, allergies to eggs, chicken proteins, or gelatin. Additionally, conditions such as DiGeorge syndrome, myasthenia gravis, a thymoma, or surgical removal of the thymus are absolute contraindications to vaccination. If a patient is over 60 years of age or between the ages of 6-8 months, special consideration of the true risk of disease in an area need to be weighed against potential complications from the vaccine.10 It is not uncommon for the risk of disease to be much different from the entry requirement documents of a specific country. If a patient is found to be inappropriate for vaccination, a YF clinic can issue a deferment certificate. NPs in primary care should refer any patient traveling to Africa or South America to a YF clinic for evaluation of the potential need for vaccination or documentation of YF deferment status. Additionally, if the patient\u2019s trip will take them through a YF country, even with just an airplane layover stop, vaccination or documentation may be required. The YF clinic will make the determination of vaccination or documentation needs and provide the necessary certificate to the traveler. The YF certification document is valid for 10 years after the date of issue. A list of YF clinics can be found on the CDC Web site.10\n",

Symptoms of TF include a fever of 39\u00b0C-40\u00b0C, weakness, abdominal pain, headache, anorexia, and, in some cases, a rose-colored spotted rash.

Three to five days after the early symptoms first appear, a blotchy rash and high fever occur and are often accompanied by increasing malaise and Koplik spots in the mouth and throat. The rash typically begins at the hairline and spreads downward over the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. As the fever subsides, the rash fades. A person with measles is contagious for approximately 4 days before and up to 4 days after the rash appears.20 Advise international travelers who transit into or through a country with a current outbreak to verify immunity via titer or receive a booster of measles vaccination if not contraindicated.",
