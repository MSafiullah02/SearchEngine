However, there are a number of cases, in which epidemiological, historical, or genomic evidence suggests much older viral origins than those obtained via molecular dating. We demonstrate how pervasive purifying selection can mask the ancient origins of recently sampled pathogens, in part due to the inability of nucleotide-based substitution models to properly account for complex patterns of spatial and temporal variability in selective pressures. We use codon-based substitution models to infer the length of branches in viral phylogenies; these models produce estimates that are often considerably longer than those obtained with traditional nucleotide-based substitution models. Correcting the apparent underestimation of branch lengths suggests substantially older origins for measles, Ebola, and avian influenza viruses. This work helps to reconcile some of the inconsistencies between molecular dating and other types of evidence concerning the age of viral lineages.",

            "text": "At first glance, a recent introduction of many RNA viruses into the human population is unsurprising. Epidemiological, historical, and phylogenetic approaches agree that some of the most notable RNA viruses (e.g., HIV-1, Worobey et al. 2008; influenza A virus, Taubenberger et al. 2005 ; Ebola virus [EBOV] Zaire, Walsh et al. 2005; and SARS coronavirus, Hon et al. 2008 ) emerged as zoonoses within the last century. As one looks further back in evolutionary time, however, specific inconsistencies arise. For example, defective remnants of ancient integrations of Filoviridae, the viral family containing the EBOV, are found in mammalian lineages that diverged tens of millions of years ago (Belyi et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2010) , even though molecular dating suggests a time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for Filoviridae on the order of only thousands of years ago (Suzuki and Gojobori 1997) . Another inconsistency can be seen in the zoonotic origin of measles virus (MeV) from rinderpest virus (RPV) and peste-des-petits ruminants virus (PPRV), two viruses capable of infecting large and small ruminants, respectively. MeV required at least two conditions to emerge: 1) Humans had to live in close proximity to RPV, which became commonplace only after the domestication of cattle over the last 10,000 years (Perkins 1969; Loftus et al. 1994; Beja-Pereira et al. 2006) and 2) humans needed societies with a population size above 250,000-500,000 to sustain the epidemic, which did not exist until about 5,000 years ago (Black 1966) . Furthermore, the first unambiguous historical account of measles dates back to the ninth century (R\u0101z\u012b 1848). Therefore, historical and epidemiological considerations, which place the tMRCA of MeV and RPV at thousands of years ago, are at odds with molecular dating analysis, which infers the tMRCA to be only hundreds of years ago (Furuse et al. 2010) .",

More recently, Suchard and Rambaut (2009) observed that synonymous substitutions appeared to saturate faster than could be handled by nucleotide models in mitochondrial DNA, which is subject to strong overall purifying selection. Over longer periods of evolutionary time (i.e., along long internal branches on a phylogenetic tree), evidence of evolution at the nucleotide level could be lost, which could bias tMRCA estimates towards younger dates (i.e., underestimate the length of these branches). If a substitution model can account for this evolution, we hypothesize that a comparative analysis of recent viral isolates could be used to make inference about ancient viral divergence events.",

Next, EBOV full-length glycoprotein sequences with known years of isolation were downloaded from GenBank. Regions containing multiple reading frames (Volchkov et al. 1995; Sanchez et al. 1996) and the mucin-like region-which evolves extremely rapidly due to relaxed selective constraints (Wertheim and Worobey 2009b )-were removed. The curated EBOV data set contained 34 sequences sampled between 1976 and 2005. As before, alignment was trivial and performed by eye. The final alignment, AIV neuraminidase, was provided by Chen and Holmes (2010) . It contained 270 sequences sampled between 1972 and 2005. All three alignments in NEXUS format can be downloaded from http://www.hyphy.org/wiki/codondating. Redundant sequences were excluded from the alignments for branch length comparisons and selection analyses.",

First, an area of parameter space to be sampled is defined by constructing a d -dimensional rectangle, in which each dimension represents a single model parameter, the corresponding coordinate interval is centered on the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter, and the lower and upper bounds are determined by profile likelihood. Second, each coordinate interval is partitioned into N = 1, 000d subintervals of approximately equal probability, based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the likelihood surface. Third, N samples are drawn from the d -dimensional rectangle, using the Latin Hypercube scheme (i.e., each interval in every coordinate is sampled exactly once).

In this method, three rates are inferred from each site: \u03b1 s , \u03b2 I s , and \u03b2 T s . Subscript s indicates the explicit dependence of substitution rates on the site, from which they are being estimated. \u03b1 s is the tree-wide synonymous rate, \u03b2 I s is the nonsynonymous rate shared by all internal branches, and \u03b2 T s is the nonsynonymous rate shared by all terminal branches. Only internal branches were used to generate empirical selection profiles because substitutions along tips in viral phylogenies are frequently deleterious and transient (Kosakovsky et al. 2006; Pybus et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, we were primarily interested in the effects of selection on long internal branches, and the IFEL profile (\u03b1 s and \u03b2 I s inferred for each site) was meant to recapitulate the evolutionary process along an \"average\" internal branch. Simulations were initialized using ancestral nucleotide sequences inferred with marginal maximum likelihood reconstruction (Yang et al. 1995) in HyPhy, using the MG94 \u00d7 REV codon substitution model on the MCC phylogeny obtained from BMCMC general time reversible (GTR) + \u0393 4 analyses. The marginal ancestral sequence was used to provide a realistic starting point for our simulations. Ten thousand replicates were generated for each branch length ranging from 0.01 to 100 expected substitutions per nucleotide site and analyzed under the GTR + \u0393 4 and Dual substitution models. We chose to simulate branches based on expected substitutions per nucleotide site, instead of per unit time, because of the difficulty in standardizing time for variable rate parameters (i.e., \u03b1 s , \u03b2 I s , and substitution rate) in a reversible model; the expected number of substitutions divided by the substitution rate can be a proxy for time.",

(2010) : 6.02 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (3.62 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -8.76 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) substitutions/site/year. Therefore, we inferred a substantially younger tMRCA for MeV and RPV: 1490 CE (1130-1810 CE), instead of 1171 CE (678-1612 CE). We consider our rate estimates more reliable for three reasons. First, our values are in close agreement with previous substitution rate estimates in MeV: 8.69 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (5.89 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -1.13 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) substitutions/site/year (Pomeroy et al. 2008) . Second, Furuse et al. (2010) included both MeV and RPV vaccine strains in their BMCMC dating analysis (Rota et al. 1994 ; Baron et al. 1996) , despite evidence that the inclusion of vaccine strains can lead to bias in rate estimation (Bush et al. 2000; Wertheim 2010 ). Third, Furuse et al. (2010) fitted an exponential growth coalescent prior to viruses whose effective population size has been declining-due to eradication efforts against both MeV and RPV (Moss 2009; Normile 2010 ). Remarkably, our results are in even greater conflict with the historical documentation of measles (R\u0101z\u012b 1848), further confirming our conjecture that traditional nucleotide substitution models can underestimate the age of ancient viral divergence events. We then explored whether alternative evolutionary models that, to varying extents, account for codon structure were able to recover the expected older tMRCAs for these viruses (table 1) . The simplest approach, excluding the third codon position in a GTR + \u0393 4 model, has been used to remove synonymous sites that might have experienced saturation (Worobey et al. 2010) . A more sophisticated approach, the SRD06 model (Shapiro et al. 2006) , allows first and second codon positions to have a different transition/transversion ratio and \u0393 4 shape parameter from the third position. Amino acid substitution models have also been successfully implemented to estimate the age of RNA viruses (Zlateva et al. 2005; Wertheim et al. 2009 ). Finally, we evaluated an available codon-based substitution model, GY94 (Goldman and Yang 1994) . Generally, these alternate models either produced younger tMRCAs (e.g., GTR + \u0393 4 excluding third positions and Whelan and Goldman + \u0393 4 ) or tMRCAs that were indistinguishable from GTR + \u0393 4 (e.g., SRD06 and GY94 + \u0393 4 ). A possible exception was analysis of the EBOV data set with GY94 + \u0393 4 , which produced a root tMRCA that was 50% older than the GTR + \u0393 4 estimate. Finally, as a point of comparison, we also investigated how removing site-to-site rate variation affected dating inference by using a GTR model (Tavar\u00e9 1986 ); ignoring rate variation invariably produced younger tMRCAs.",

An increase in the proportion of sites simulated under purifying selection (i.e., \u03b2 s = 0) resulted in shorter branches inferred by a GTR + \u0393 4 model ( fig. 1A ) . Sufficiently strong purifying selection could theoretically lead to underestimates of branch lengths by an order of magnitude because purifying selection slows down the rate of evolution relative to the synonymous rate. At the extreme (\u03b2 s = 0, branch length \u2192 \u221e), one obtains perfectly conserved amino acid sequences and completely saturated synonymous substitutions. For sequences with 10% of sites under strict conservation, the nucleotide estimator approached the asymptote of 7.1 substitutions/site, even when the simulated branch length was increased to 100; the branch length estimate was accurate for up to 5 substitutions/site. For sequences with no nonsynonymous substitutions (i.e., 100% conservation), saturation occurred much sooner, around 0.25 substitutions/site, and the corresponding asymptote was 0.36 substitutions/site. The nucleotide substitution model (GTR + \u0393 4 ) underestimated the length of branches simulated under empirical (IFEL) selection regimes inferred from the three viral data sets ( fig. 1B-1D) ; branch lengths for sequences simulated under neutral selection (i.e., \u03b1 s = \u03b2 s = 1) were reliably inferred by GTR + \u0393 4 . The proportion of sites under strong negative selection (i.e., \u03b2 s < \u03b1 s with an IFEL P value 0.05) differed markedly among the three data sets. MeV/RPV/PPRV nucleoprotein and EBOV glycoprotein genes experienced moderate levels of purifying selection along internal branches: 50% and 45% of sites under strong purifying selection, respectively. The AIV neuraminidase gene evolved under much stronger selective constraints, with 89% of sites under strong purifying selection. We note that the power to detect selection using IFEL increases with the size of the alignment (Kosakovsky et al. 2006 ); hence, we would expect more sites evolving under purifying selection to be correctly detected as such in the larger AIV data set. The simulated codon saturation curves varied from virus to virus, indicating that the particular selectiveregime, amino acid composition, and nucleotide substitution model of each viral gene have a substantial influence on the ability to accurately infer branch lengths. Although underestimation is more pronounced along longer branches (e.g., about half the true length for 1 substitution/site), not accounting for selection can lead to underestimation of branch lengths even for relatively short branches (e.g., 0.2-0.5 substitutions/site).",

Furthermore, similar behavior was observed for the longest branches simulated under neutrality (\u03b1 s = \u03b2 s ) and inferred using GTR + \u0393 4 ( fig. 1B -1D ) , suggesting that both models perform equivalently, as expected.

First, we examined two extremes among nucleotide substitution models that do not adjust for rate variation across sites: JC69 (Jukes and Cantor 1969) and GTR. JC69 assumes a single substitution rate and equal base frequencies, whereas GTR allows each class of nucleotide substitution to occur at a unique rate and estimates base frequencies from the data. As expected, failure to account for site-to-site rate variation led to severe underestimation of longer branches in all three viral data sets (JC69 or GTR vs. GTR + \u0393 4 , fig. 3 the importance of modeling site-to-site rate variation to accurate inference.

Therefore, we investigated how extensions of the MG94 model that incorporate \u03b2, \u03b1, and lineage-specific rate variation affected branch length inference (table 2) . For MeV and AIV, the Lineage+Dual (two-rate) model that allowed longer internal branches to share their own ratio E [\u03b2]/E [\u03b1] provided the best fit to the data. For EBOV, a more complicated (eight-rate) model, in which each intersubtype branch and the long terminal branches leading to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Bundibugyo had their own rates, was fit because E [\u03b2]/E [\u03b1] varied dramatically among the intersubtype branches. The inclusion of variation in \u03b2 and \u03b1 in the Nonsynonymous and Dual models resulted in notable increases in the cumulative length of deep internal branches (table 2; supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online) . In all three viral data sets, however, the most substantial differences were seen with the Lineage+Dual model, which produced lengths for long internal branches that were substantially greater than those inferred under GTR + \u0393 4 ( fig. 3) . Importantly, the lengths of the more recent intraspecies/subtype/serotype branches were relatively unchanged between these two models for all three data sets; this observation confirms that when the phylogeny is comprised of relatively short branches, it is appropriate to rely on common approximations, such as the GTR + \u0393 4 model. This increase in the length of only deep internal branches was likely due to the dramatically stronger purifying selection which we inferred along these lineages (table 2). In AIV, for instance, E [\u03b2]/E [\u03b1] was two orders of magnitude lower on deep interior branches, compared with the rest of the tree.",

This extrapolation is meant as a rather crude approximation of the age of this divergence event; nevertheless, these dates are more likely to be closer to the true split between MeV and RPV than previous estimates and are not inconsistent with recorded history of measles. The degree of synonymous saturation observed along the EBOV and AIV phylogenies indicate an inability to reliably infer tMRCAs for these viruses. Too many sites have sunk beyond the evolutionary horizon. Nevertheless, these estimates could provide meaningful minimum bounds for the tMRCAs. Thus, for both EBOV and AIV, we applied the mean substitution rate inferred in the BMCMC GTR + \u0393 4 analyses to the Lineage+Dual phylogenies. This approach suggested that the minimum tMRCA estimates for EBOV and AIV are approximately 70,000 and 200,000 years ago, respectively. The actual tMRCAs may be much older.",

The same forces of purifying selection that maintain evidence of protein sequence homology over great evolutionary distances also truncate long ancestral branches deep within phylogenetic trees. We observed this pattern MBE in three different groups of rapidly evolving negative-sense RNA viruses: MeV/RPV/PPRV, EBOV, and AIV. Estimating branch lengths under a codon-based substitution model that accounts for spatial and temporal variation in selection pressures yielded phylogenetic trees that were more than twice as long as those obtained under standard nucleotide models. Modeling synonymous, nonsynonymous, and lineage-specific rate variation indicates that current estimates of the age of these, and possibly other, viral lineages may be dramatically underestimated. Codon models used in this study do not circumvent the issue of substitutional saturation but merely extend the horizon further back in evolutionary time; the application of more complex and biologically realistic models is likely to extend these branches even further into the past. Eventually, however, even the most realistic models are likely to fail and external information, such as biogeography and homology to endogenous viral elements, must be brought into consideration to estimate truly ancient events (Katzourakis et al. 2009; Katzourakis and Gifford 2010) .",

The domestication of cattle beginning 10, 000 years ago provided the necessary exposure to RPV, and the development of agriculture allowed human populations to reach sizes necessary to sustain an epidemic. However, the historical record of measles is ambiguous until the ninth century, when Rhazes (a Persian physician) outlined the criteria for differentiating between measles and smallpox (R\u0101z\u012b 1848). Rhazes discusses both ailments as immemorial, indicating that both diseases predated him by many generations. Although there are historical records of earlier plagues that could be interpreted as measles, notably in eighth century France during the battle of Tours (Rolleston 1937) , it is also possible that this plague could have been smallpox or another disease with similar presentation. Even after Rhazes description, Western medicine still confounded measles, smallpox, and scarlet fever until the 17th century (Rolleston 1937) . In light of this confusion, the lack of a definitive description of measles before Rhazes (e.g., Galen, an ancient Roman physician, described smallpox but not measles) does not establish that the virus was absent (McNeill 1976) . It is plausible that MeV might have not entered the human population until the first millennium of the Common Era, as our analysis suggests. Alternatively, MeV could have emerged thousands of years ago, and the evolutionary models employed here are too crude to recover the true age of the virus. Regardless of which scenario is correct, accounting for variable selective pressures is an important step in revealing the ancient history of RNA viruses.",

Furthermore, short-term estimates of viral substitution rates (inferred from population-based rate estimates at the tips of phylogenies) are often found to be several orders of magnitude faster than long-term estimates of substitution rates (inferred from external calibrations located deeper in the phylogeny). This inconsistency has been reported for hepatitis B virus (Zhou and Holmes 2007; Gilbert and Feschotte 2010) and simian immunodeficiency virus (Wertheim and Worobey 2009a; Worobey et al. 2010) , suggesting that long-term substitution rates can be orders of magnitude lower than short-term substitution rates. An alternative, and more parsimonious, explanation is that a single substitution rate (albeit one possibly slower than that inferred using short-term population-based data) predominates throughout the history of these viruses. And our inability to accurately estimate branch lengths creates the appearance of dramatically lower substitution rates deep in the phylogenetic tree. Although the methods presented here do not correct for branch lengths on the order needed to reconcile short-term substitution rates with deep calibrations, they provide a glimpse at the missing evolution that most current methods of phylogenetic inference fail to capture.",

First, the inference of substantially different selective regimes on longer internal branches compared with shorter shallower branches (e.g., using Lineage+Dual, , or Free Ratio, Yang 1998 , codon models) appears to be a sign that older tMRCAs may be underestimated. Second, if the synonymous substitution rate approaches saturation along a branch or group of branches, it is likely that the tMRCA cannot be reliably inferred. If either of these patterns is encountered, the inferred tMRCA estimates should be interpreted with caution. Rapid advances in cheap and accessible computational power will undoubtedly move the fields of paleovirology and molecular dating towards increasingly more realistic evolutionary models that account for variation in selective regimes (Suchard and Rambaut 2009 ).
