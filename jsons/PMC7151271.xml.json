            "text": "In late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 latter) began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread in a substantial number of countries [1,2]. The epidemic was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 12, 2020 [3]. According to a Chinese study, 80% of patients present with mild symptoms and the overall fatality rate is about 2.3%, although this rises to 8.0% in patients between the ages of 70\u201379 years and to 14.8% in those aged 80 years and over [4]. However, it is highly likely that there are a large number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus it is probable that the mortality rate has been overestimated. To take the example of the outbreak onboard the Diamond Princess cruise-ship, the fatality rate was 1.4% [5]. France is now facing the onslaught of COVID-19 with more than 25,000 cases, as March 26th, 2020 [5]. Thus, there is a critical and urgent need for an effective treatment in order to cure symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage and thus limit transmission in the community. Among the candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning old drugs for use as an antiviral treatment is a compelling strategy, because knowledge about these drugs\u2019 safety profile, side effects, pharmacokinetics and drug interactions are already well known [6,7].",

In addition, of those who have treated COVID-19 patients, 37% believe that hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine) is the most effective therapy against the disease, and 32% believe the same for azithromycin (or similar antibiotics). Given that more than one third of physician now prescribe these drugs to COVID-19 patients, it is of critical importance to evaluate the effectiveness of such medications (https://public-cdn.sermo.com/covid19/c8/be4e/4edbd4/dbd4ba4ac5a3b3d9a479f99cc5/wave-i-sermo-covid-19-global-analysis-final.pdf).",

In addition, and in parallel to this study, we evaluated in vitro the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and showed that there was a considerable synergy of these two products when they were used at doses which mimic the concentrations likely to be obtained in humans (https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andreani-et-al.-Pre-print-V2.pdf). Other studies have pointed out that drug repurposing may identify approved drugs that could be useful for the treatment of this disease including, notably, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, as well as anti-diabetics such as metformin, angiotensin receptor inhibitors such as sartans, or statins such as simvastatin [11]. In addition, chloroquine has demonstrated its efficacy in Chinese COVID-19 patients in clinical trials by reducing fever, improving CT imaging, and delaying disease progression [[12], [13], [14]], leading Chinese experts to recommend chloroquine-based treatment (500 mg twice per day for ten days) as a first line-treatment for mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 [15].",

In this context, it is necessary to avoid a worsening evolution, which usually occurs around the tenth day and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, the prognosis of which, in particular in the elderly, is poor, whatever the cause. Therefore, the primary therapeutic objective is to treat people who have moderate or severe infections at an early enough stage to avoid progression to a serious and irreversible condition. By administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, we were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible. For all other patients in this cohort of 80 people, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a clinical improvement that appeared superior when compared to outcomes of other hospitalised patients, as described in the literature. In a cohort of 191 Chinese inpatients, of whom 95% received antibiotics and 21% received a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, the median duration of fever was 12 days and that of cough 19 days in survivors, with a 28% case-fatality rate [19]. The favourable evolution of our patients under hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin paralleled a relatively rapid decrease in viral RNA load as assessed by PCR, which was even more rapid when assessed by culture. These data are important to compare with that of the literature which shows that the viral RNA load can remain high for about three weeks in most patients in the absence of specific treatment [19,23] with extreme cases lasting for more than a month. A study conducted in 76 Chinese COVID-19 inpatients showed that high viral RNA load is associated with the severity of the disease [24]. Furthermore, in a study conducted on a small group of 16 Chinese COVID-19 inpatients, viral RNA was positively detected in 50% of them, after resolution of symptoms for a median duration of 2.5 days and a maximum of eight days [25]. Therefore, the rapid decrease in viral RNA load is one element suggesting the effectiveness of this treatment. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the measurement of viral culture during treatment was also evaluated for the first time. The fall in culture positivity from the second day is remarkable, although, in a relatively small number of cases, some people maintain a positive culture.",

The elimination of viral carriage in the human reservoir of the virus has recently been recognised as a priority [26]. To this end, the rapid decease in positivity in cultures from patients\u2019 respiratory samples under treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin supports an effectiveness of this combination. Thus, in addition to its direct therapeutic role, this combination can play a role in controlling the disease epidemic by limiting the duration of virus shedding, which can last for several weeks in the absence of specific treatment. In our Institute, which contains 75 individual rooms for treating highly contagious patients, we currently have a turnover rate of 1/3 per day which allows us to receive a large number of these contagious patients with early discharge.",

Because of anecdotical reports of heart complications with such drugs in patients with underlying conditions, it would be useful to perform an ECG before or at the very beginning of the treatment [27]. This problem is solved by hospitalising patients at risk in continuing care units with ECG monitoring allowing for the early detection and treatment of possible cardiac side-effects. Azithromycin is the drug that has been the most widely prescribed against respiratory infections and a recent (2010) study showed that one in eight American patients, has been prescribed azithromycin [28]. Indeed, there have probably been more than a billion azithromycin prescriptions around the world since it was first discovered. The toxicity of each of these two drugs does not, therefore, pose a major problem. Their possible toxicity in combination has been suggested in a few anecdotal reports but, to our knowledge, has never been demonstrated.",
