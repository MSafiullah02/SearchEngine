This is the first study to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastrointestinal bleeding outcomes. Patients admitted during the pandemic, even those without COVID-19, had more concerning laboratory findings on admission, were less likely to undergo inpatient endoscopy, more likely to be transfused, and had increased hospital length of stay.
