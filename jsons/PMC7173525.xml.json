            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are ubiquitous pathogens which are the leading cause of the common cold syndrome. Once considered mostly a nuisance, these viruses are now appreciated as the cause of medically significant illness and a substantial burden of disease. Although illness is typically mild and self-limited, lost time from work and school creates a considerable economic burden. Infection of the upper airways is the most common site of infection, although lower airways disease is also now well documented, as is the link between HRV infection and exacerbations of asthma. Unfortunately, effective specific antiviral treatments and vaccines remain elusive. In this article, the basic virology, pathogenesis of disease, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, and current methods of treatment and prevention will be reviewed.",

Since it was first identified in 1956, 101 serotypes of rhinovirus have been cultured and distinguished by distinctions in neutralizing antibody. These 101 serotypes have been classified into two species, HRV-A and HRV-B, though in recent years sequencing technology has led to the identification of more than 60 genotypes of viruses which do not grow in culture and have been placed into a third species, HRV-C (Bochkov et al., 2015). The rhinoviruses are also classified on the basis of receptor specificity. The \u2018major\u2019 receptor group, which comprises \u223c90% of serotypes A and B, uses the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) as the receptor for infecting host cells (Staunton et al., 1989). Twelve HRV-A serotypes use an alternative site, the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and the receptor for the HRV-C viruses is human cadherin-related family member 3 (Bochkov et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Rhinoviruses are small, nonenveloped viruses with a single strand of positive-sense RNA (Greenberg, 2003). Each virion is composed of 7.2 kb of genomic material packed in a 30-nm icosahedric protein shell known as a capsid (Royston and Tapparel, 2016; Figure 1(a)\n). The capsid is, in turn, comprised of 12 pentamers each with five protein subunits called protomers containing four viral proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. Each pentamer contains a central shared depression or \u2018canyon\u2019 in the five VP1 proteins of the protomer subunits, which serves as the binding site for ICAM-1 receptors in host cells (Figure 1(b) and 1(c)). Once attachment to the host cell is achieved, viral replication occurs in the host cell cytoplasm. Antibody neutralization occurs when IgG binds to the viral surface and obstructs access of the host-cell receptor to the viral attachment site at the base of the canyon (Turner, 2015). VP2 and VP3 are also found on the surface of the capsid and have antigenic sites important for the host immune response. VP4 is located on the internal side of the capsid and interacts with the viral genome. The genomic data that code for VP1 are somewhat conserved among the various subtypes of HRV, though variations in VP1, VP2, and VP3 account for antigenic diversity among serotypes and impede the development of effective vaccines and antiviral agents.",

Transmission from infected to susceptible individuals most likely occurs when viral load is highest and secretions are plentiful and difficult to control. Under experimental conditions, a viral titer of 103 TCID 50 (tissue culture infective dose) was needed to transmit infection and most often occurred on the 2nd or 3rd day of a cold during peak symptoms (Turner, 2015). Epidemiologic evidence suggests that direct contact and self-inoculation account for the majority of HRV transmissions. Classic transmission studies of infected and susceptible subjects demonstrated that hand to hand or from hands to intermediary surfaces with recipient self-inoculation efficiently transmits HRV (Hendley et al., 1973). More recent experimental studies have shown that transmission of HRV is possible by small and large particle aerosols, but how frequently this occurs in natural settings is unclear.",

HRV grows best at 33 \u00b0C in cell culture and primarily in the upper respiratory tract, although infection of the lower airways and sinuses, at higher body temperatures, is possible. Both ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells can be infected, and as infection progresses, affected areas may be patchy (Figure 2\n). HRV infection is not cytopathic, and it is generally accepted that the majority of symptoms are due to the host inflammatory response. Infection is limited to the respiratory tract with only rare reports of invasive disease (Brownlee and Turner, 2008). Although HRV is rarely cultured from blood, HRV RNA has been detected in the plasma in \u223c10% of normal children with HRV infection and was more common in those with severe illness and asthma exacerbations. However, it is unclear if detection of viral RNA in plasma truly represents systemic infection.",

            "text": "Once infection has been established, a complex interplay of neurogenic and host responses occurs. Early infection is characterized by a vigorous inflammatory response brought about by the elaboration of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-6, IL-8, and interferon-induced protein 10 (Pitkaranta and Hayden, 1998; Turner, 2015). The concentration of these inflammatory mediators correlates with the severity of symptoms and results in an influx of neutrophils, increased vascular permeability, swelling of the nasal mucosa, and leakage of serum into nasal secretions. The kinins, bradykinin, and lysyl bradykinin can also be found in the secretions of HRV-infected individuals, and their presence and concentrations also correlate with symptoms. Yet, treatment by blocking kinins has been ineffectual in alleviating symptoms raising questions as to the relevance of kinins in HRV disease pathogenesis. Moreover, despite the frequency of antihistamines in many cold treatments, there is no evidence of histamine release in HRV infection. This may be due to the fact that neurogenic reflexes also appear to play a role in disease pathogenesis, with parasympathetic nerves controlling the flow of secretions from the nasal seromucous glands. Finally, the importance of HRV infection and asthma exacerbations is now well recognized (Gern and Busse, 1999). The precise mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be fully investigated but appears to involve genetic predisposition and allergic airway factors measured by immunoglobulin E (IgE).",

Infection results in the production of both serum IgG and nasal IgA beginning around 2 weeks after infection and results in long-lasting protection to the specific infecting HRV serotype. Resolution of symptoms and clearance of virus occur before the induction of nasal or serum antibodies, indicating a different mechanism for viral clearance. The inflammatory response produced during initial infection with HRV does not appear responsible for clearance of the virus. Although the inflammatory response correlates with symptoms, asymptomatic individuals with little or no inflammatory response can efficiently clear HRV infection. The mechanism by which HRV clearance occurs likely involves the cellular immune response. Both CD4 and CD8 cells can recognize heterologous HRV antigens and represent memory cells in persons with prior HRV infection (Kennedy et al., 2012; Steinke et al., 2015). These cells function as immune surveillance and are able to produce a rapid adaptive immune response.",

A thin, clear, irritating secretion flows, and makes the edges of the nostrils sore \u2026 usually within 36 hours the nasal secretions become turbid and more profuse\u2026 and gradually, within 4\u20135 days, the symptoms resolve\u201d (Gwaltney et al., 1967). In his studies, Gwaltney et al. (1967) had detailed the symptoms and time course of the typical HRV upper respiratory infection (URI). Rhinorrhea (65%) and sneezing (50%) were the most common complaints in the first 3 days. Scratchy or mild sore throat and headaches are also common in the first few days of illness. Fever is uncommon, although some patients complained of feverishness (15%) and chilly sensations (10%). Lower respiratory tract symptoms such as hoarseness and cough are less common occurring in one-fourth to one-third of cases although if present, symptoms tend to linger throughout the illness. When compared with other viral respiratory illnesses, significantly more sneezing occurred with HRV infections. The mean length of illness was 8.9 days with a range of 1\u201333 days.",

Using RT-PCR in addition to standard testing, Johnson et al. demonstrated that over 80% of the asthma exacerbations in children aged 9\u201311 years were associated with viral infections of which HRV accounted for approximately two-thirds. In addition to epidemiologic links of HRV and asthma, HRV human challenge models have provided insights into the mechanisms by which HRV infection may worsen asthma (Greenberg, 2003; Papdopoulos et al., 2000). Intranasal and inhaled inoculations of HRV induced bronchoconstriction after methacholine challenge in subjects with mild to moderate asthma (Gern and Busse, 1999). The host immune response to infection induces proinflammatory mediators leading to a cascade of inflammation, activation of neural pathways to enhance airway hyperresponsiveness, and obstruction (Figure 3\n). In addition to asthma, HRV has been associated with \u223c40% of acute exacerbations of COPD (Greenberg, 2003).

However, HRV RT-PCR assays are currently only available commercially as part of multiplexed real-time PCR platforms for respiratory viruses such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Biofire, Utah). This has resulted in some loss of sensitivity and specificity since most of these assays are unable to distinguish between HRV and other enteroviruses.

Efforts to develop HRV vaccinations soon followed, and initial clinical trials in humans involved the use of formalin-inactivated single serotype HRV vaccines. Results of these trials demonstrated significant reduction in the rate of symptomatic colds (Glanville and Johnston, 2015). However, with the discovery of HRV antigenic diversity resulting in more than 100 different serotypes isolated, this approach was abandoned in favor of multivalent vaccines incorporating 10 serotypes which unfortunately failed to demonstrate significant cross-protection among HRV serotypes. Consequently HRV vaccine research was largely abandoned for more than 20 years.",

In one recent report, recombinant VP0 protein (VP4 + VP2 precursor), which appears to be highly conserved in HRV-A and HRV-B serotypes, was used as an immunogen in mice and shown to induce cross-serotype T cell recruitment and activation as well as neutralizing antibody production which resulted in accelerated clearance of virus in vivo (McLean, 2014). This approach suggests that cross-serotype protection is possible, and while it is unlikely that a single immunogen will generate protection against all HRV serotypes, VP0 may be a useful candidate for a broadly protective subunit vaccine.",

Consequently, though innocuously referred to as \u2018the common cold,\u2019 HRV infections constitute a significant burden with associated health care and economic costs.
