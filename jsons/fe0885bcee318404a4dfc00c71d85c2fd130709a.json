Most of these measures rely on the compliance of people, who are asked to reduce their social contacts to a minimum. In this note we argue that individuals' adherence to prescriptions and reduction of social activity may not be efficacious if not implemented robustly on all social groups, especially on those characterized by intense mixing patterns. Actually, it is possible that, if those who have many contacts reduce them proportionally less than those who have few, then the effect of a policy could backfire: the disease would take more time to die out, up to the point that it could become endemic. In a nutshell, unless one gets everyone to act, and specifically those who have more contacts, a policy may even be counterproductive. * We thank Alberto Dalmazzo, Matthew Jackson and Alessia Melegaro for very helpful comments.

Looking at people's responses and decisions can be helpful to design policies against diseases and to understand how they affect the behavior of other members of the society.",

In most cases, initially the population have been asked to limit their contacts relying on the individual sense of responsibility (an extreme case was the initial approach in the United Kingdom, where isolation was intended only for people suspected to be infected or arrived from abroad, as stated by the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 on March 10); while only at a later stage rigid temporary laws have been issued (like China on January 23 and 26, 2020, or Italy on March 4 and 11). There are still countries like Sweden, where on March 27 the Government banned only public gatherings of more than 50 people. However, independently of the nature of the restrictions, it is clear that not every individual responds in the same way to impositions and requests. Some people cut immediately all their social contacts, while others may only marginally reduce them. The classic argument of revealed preferences suggests that those who have more social relations will be less prone to limit them: their behavior reveals that they care more than others about social interactions, for personal taste or for professional reasons. So, if we just ask people to reduce their contacts at a level they feel safe, everybody will trade off the expected risks with the benefit that they perceive from socialization. Thus, those who have many contacts every day will be proportionally less inclined to cut them, compared than those who have few.",

Imagine a social-distancing policy that asks people to limit their contacts to reduce the diffusion of a disease. This generates a new reduced social network that is smaller but denser. The main unintended negative consequence of the policy could be that even if the disease was eventually going to die out in the original social network, it becomes endemic in the new network instead.

Whether the disease will be endemic or not turns out to depend on the interplay between the features of the disease itself and the statistical properties of the social network through which it is spreading. The disease is concisely described by the transmission rate, \u03b2, and the recovery rate, \u03b4. The characteristics of the social network are captured by the number of contacts that one has d. In particular, by its average across people, denoted d , and by the expected square of this number, d 2 .",

This can happen, for instance, if those who have more contacts are relatively less responsive to the policy indications. Unfortunately, then, the new smaller network might have some properties, such as a low \u00b5, that might hinder the containment of the disease or even \"help\" the disease to remain endemic among those individuals who keep on being active.",

As usually happens in the real world (see Fig.  1 ), many people have few connections while few individuals, called hubs, have a lot more. Now, say that everybody is asked to cut their meetings by the same quantity (to begin with, just three contacts, which is more than half for peripheral nodes, but proportionally very little for the hubs), so that the new degree distribution is shifted down, but keeps the same variance. In this case, a \u00b5 that was originally higher than \u03bb may actually decrease, so that a disease may remain active for more time. If more contacts are dropped with the same uniform rule, \u00b5 may keep decreasing, up to the point that it becomes smaller than \u03bb, and the disease remains endemic in the society, at least as long as the population is in the new network exhibits \u00b5 < \u03bb. This remains true even if an additional cut completely isolates some nodes in the network, or even most of them. The sub-population of the remaining ones, those who had originally many links and are still very connected, will behave as an incubator for the disease because they form now a denser sub-network.",

More in detail, we first consider a degree-based random mixing model with an infinite number of agents, often thought as an \"approximation\" of a large social network. Then, we consider a tractable first approximation of a susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) model based on a simple linear form, standard in the literature. (4;5) Although we are not the first ones to consider this model in a context of quarantine, all previous works have focused on different issues and did not consider the possible negative effects of a quarantine that is not homogeneous. (6;7;8) Technically, we adopt a SIS model because its ergodic nature delivers neat analytical results. Moreover, it is still not clear to scientists whether COVID-19 can affect more than once the same person. Cases of multiple infection in the same person have been reported by the end of February in China and Japan.",
