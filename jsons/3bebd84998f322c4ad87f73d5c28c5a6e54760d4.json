Skellam(\u03bb) denotes the distribution of the difference between two independent random variables following a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb. This distribution was first investigated by Irwin (1937) and is a special case of a Skellam distribution with both parameters equal to \u03bb; see Skellam (1946) . Alomani et al. (2018) considered such a Skellam-GARCH process of order p = q = 1 and derive the estimating equations for a conditional maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters. However, perhaps because of the absence of suitable probabilistic tools for such models, they did not provide a further analysis of the asymptotic properties of this estimator. These authors also provided an overview of related results and applied the model to differences of non-negative data of counts of monthly drug crimes.",

Using arguments found in Eberle (2019, Chapter 3) and Douc et al. (2018, Theorem 20.3 .4) we show that this implies the existence and uniqueness of a stationary regime of (Z t ) t , and therefore of ((X t , \u03bb t )) t , too. Furthermore, we use the contraction property once more to prove absolute regularity (\u03b2-mixing) with exponentially decaying coefficients of the count process (X t ) t . We are convinced that these results can serve as a basis for further work with these and related models. As an example, population dynamics will be considered after differentiation, in order to rate the speed or the acceleration of the evolution of species under consideration; indeed both characteristics may be either positive or negative. As an illustration of their usefulness, we apply in Section 3 our results to prove asymptotic normality of a least squares estimator of the parameters of a Skellam-ARCH model. This is complemented by simulations and by an analysis of recent COVID-19 data from Mauritius. We think that the approach used in this paper can also be used for many models with a similar structure. For example, we could replace the Skellam distribution by the distribution of the difference of independent variables following a mixed Poisson distribution. As mentioned in Christou and Fokianos (2014) , this includes the cases with negative binomial and zero-inflated Poisson distributions which are of interest if data show underdispersion. All proofs and a few auxiliary results are collected in a final Section 4.",

Therefore it is natural to model the intensity process as in (1.1b), where the intensities enter linearly while the count variables are squared. Therefore, and since X t conditioned on F t\u22121 follows a centered law, we were not able to apply arguments for the contraction in mean as in Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) in order to show existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution, as done for example in Doukhan and Wintenberger (2008) . The mismatch of powers in (1.1b) is the reason why we establish in Proposition 2.1 a contraction property w.r.t. a distance where the intensities and the count variables enter with the appropriate different powers. Using this, it seems to be also possible to derive an alternative property of weak dependence, called \u03c4 -dependence.

This has been generalized in Doukhan and Neumann (2019) to semi-contractive models and in Doukhan et al. (2020) to the case of possibly non-stationary processes. In all of these papers, the mixing properties were derived by an explicit coupling of two versions of the processes which were tailor-made for the respective properties of the processes. In this paper, our approach is slightly different. We derive both stationarity and mixing properties on the basis of a one-step contractivity property given in Proposition 2.1.

Historically, the first three cases were detected on 18 March 2020 and thereon, the Mauritian government imposes an immediate lockdown on 20 March 2020 followed by a curfew measure on 23.04.2020. In this part of the paper, we analyze the series of infected cases as listed in data.europa.eu. The original data was tested non-stationary by the adftest with p-values around 0.0962 and by applying the diff routine, we obtain the first-order differenced series that contains a series of positive and negative values while exhibiting severe over-dispersion. Moreover, the VarSelect routine yields a superior AIC at lag order 3. Hence, we deem suitable to apply the proposed model in section 3 to the training series from 18.03.2020 to 13.04.2020 and estimate possible forecasts.

In this cas\u00ea \u03b8 =\u03b8 (n) \u2208 F n and asymptotic independence yields a convergent procedure. Anyway if we fit now the coefficients over all the training set X 1 , . . . , X t\u22121 thus the estimates write from (3.2) with sample sizes either n or t \u2212 1; both estimates may be proved to be close to each other under mild mixing assumptions satisfied here in case e.g. t \u2212 n = O(log t); for this one makes use of the the classical covariance inequalities Davydov (1970) involving the mixing coefficient \u03b2 X (t \u2212 n) and t; finally cumbersome calculations yield lim t\u2192\u221e \u03b8 (t\u22121) \u2212 \u03b8 (n) = 0 in probability (in case lim t\u2192\u221e \u03b2 X (t \u2212 n) t 2 = 0.)

The above results were obtained assuming the training dataset from 18.03.2020 (time is 1) to 19.04.2020 (time n does not depend on t here)). We now use the above regression estimates or weights to forecast the number of infected COVID cases in Mauritius from 14.04.2020 to 30.04.2020 using the forecasting equation ( Based on the above results, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is computed as 1.8534.
