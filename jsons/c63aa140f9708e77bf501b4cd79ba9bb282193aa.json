The platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, is upregulated by RSV infection in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Fosfomycin, an antimicrobial agent, significantly suppressed PAF receptor induction by RSV infection at the mRNA and cell surface expression levels. Fosfomycin also suppressed RSV-induced adhesion of fluorescence-labeled S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae cells, as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The RSV-induced bacterial adhesion was suggested to be host-PAF-receptor and bacterial-phosphocholine mediated. Fosfomycin, which has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found here to suppress adhesion by disease-causing bacteria. Thus, fosfomycin might prevent secondary bacterial infection during RSV infection.",

Fosfomycin inhibits the biosynthesis of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, which is an early step of peptidoglycan synthesis. Fosfomycin shares broad-spectrum antibacterial activities and synergistic activities with various antibiotics including b-lactams (reviewed in Popovic et al., 2009) . In addition to its antibacterial activities, fosfomycin is suggested to have immunomodulatory properties, such as the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production, as shown by in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence (Morikawa et al., 1993a (Morikawa et al., , b, 1996 (Morikawa et al., , 2003 Matsumoto et al., 1997 Matsumoto et al., , 1999 Honda et al., 1998; Ishizaka et al., 1998; Okabayashi et al., 2009) . A mechanism for the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines is indicated to be inhibition of transcription factor NF-kB activity, which plays a key role in inflammatory responses (Yoneshima et al., 2003; Okabayashi et al., 2009) . PAF receptor expression is also regulated by NF-kB (Mutoh et al., 1994; Shimizu & Mutoh, 1997) . Indeed, an NF-kBspecific inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), suppresses acid-induced PAF-receptor-mediated S. pneumoniae adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells (Ishizuka et al., 2001) . In the present study, we examine the effect of fosfomycin on PAF receptor expression and bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells induced by RSV infection.",

Following five 12-h passages in CDM containing 200 mg mL \u00c01 ethanolamine, similar passages were performed in successively lower concentrations of ethanolamine (20, 2, 0.2, and then 0 mg mL \u00c01 ). The resulting mutant was capable of growth in CDM without choline or ethanolamine. The cell wall fraction was prepared as follows: cells grown to the mid-log phase were harvested and immediately boiled with saline containing 4% SDS for 20 min. The boiled cells were disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 15 min. The pellet was washed extensively with saline, and then used as a cell wall fraction. The content of choline in the cell wall preparation was determined using an enzymatic method (Assmann & Schriewer, 1985) . The choline contents of cell wall fractions from R6 and the mutant were 435 nmol mg \u00c01 and undetectable, respectively.",

            "text": "Recently, we reported that fosfomycin suppressed the RSVinduced production of chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and 'regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted' (RANTES), in the respiratory epithelial cell line A549, but that it did not affect virus replication (Okabayashi et al., 2009) . The suppression of chemokine induction by RSV is due to the downregulation of NF-kB activation (Okabayashi et al., 2009) . Yoneshima et al. (2003) also reported the suppression of NF-kB activation by fosfomycin in the human monocytic cell line U937 and in the T-cell line Jurkat stimulated with Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The PAF receptor is a receptor for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (Cundell et al., 1995; Swords et al., 2000) . Transcription of the PAF receptor gene is controlled by NF-kB (Mutoh et al., 1994; Shimizu & Mutoh, 1997) . Ishizuka et al. (2001) showed that the specific NF-kB inhibitor PDTC suppressed acid-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion to A549 cells via the suppression of PAF receptor induction. Hence, the suppression of PAF receptor expression by fosfomycin seems to be due to the suppression of NF-kB activation. Respiratory viruses, including RSV, induce PAF receptors and bacterial adhesion via it (Ishizuka et al., 2003; Avadhanula et al., 2006) . In the present study, we showed that fosfomycin suppressed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae adhesion to RSV-infected A549 cells. The bacterial adhesion was suppressed by the PAF antagonist and the anti-PAF receptor antibody. On the other hand, the phosphocholine-deficient S. pneumoniae mutant did not show RSV-induced adhesion, which was suppressed by fosfomycin. These results indicated that the PAF receptor (host)/ phosphocholine (bacteria) interaction, which is enhanced by RSV infection, was suppressed by fosfomycin through the inhibition of PAF receptor induction. Fosfomycin efficiently suppressed PAF receptor expression and RSV-induced PAF receptor-dependent bacterial adhesion at a concentration of 10 mg mL \u00c01 (Figs 1 and 2) . Goto et al. (1981) reported that the peak serum levels of fosfomycin after a rapid intravenous administration of 20 and 40 mg kg \u00c01 were 132.1 AE 31.8 and 259.3 AE 32.5 mg mL \u00c01 , respectively. Also, the peak serum levels of fosfomycin after oral administration were 7.1 AE 1.6 and 9.4 AE 3.6 mg mL \u00c01 for the 20 and 40 mg kg \u00c01 doses, respectively. Thus, fosfomycin is expected to suppress the enhanced bacterial adhesion to the RSV-induced PAF receptor by both an intravenous and an oral administration of clinically appropriate doses. Upregulation of PAF receptor expression and the enhanced adhesion of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to respiratory epithelial cells are considered to be major risk factors for secondary bacterial infections after a respiratory virus infection. We propose that fosfomycin efficiently suppresses RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and the enhanced adhesion of disease-causing bacteria.",

Suppression by fosfomycin (FOM) of RSV-induced adhesion to A549 cells of FITC-labeled cells of Streptococcus pneumoniae (strain SR4 and DR22) (a) and Haemophilus influenzae (strain SRI2 and SRI68) (b) clinical isolates, as determined by flow cytometry. Two hours before RSV infection, FOM (100 mg mL \u00c01 ) or the PAF receptor (PAF-r) antagonist (20 mg mL \u00c01 ) was added to cultured A549 cells. The cells were infected with RSV strain Long at MOI 1. After a 24-h infection, FITC-labeled bacterial cells were added to the cell monolayer at MOI 10, and incubation was continued at 37 1C for 30 min. The adhered labeled bacteria were detected by flow cytometry (black lines). Gray lines indicate cells incubated with unlabeled bacteria. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The mean fluorescence intensity was estimated and the relative value to the mean fluorescence intensity of RSVuninfected cells incubated with FITC-labeled bacteria was calculated. Figure shows the mean of relative fluorescence intensity AE SD. \u00c3 Statistically significant (P o 0.01) from RSV-infected cells without the addition of any inhibitory agents (none).",

(a) A549 cells were infected with the RSV strain Long at MOI 1. After infection at the time indicated, the cells were collected and then stained with an anti-PAF-r antibody and a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (thick lines). The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Thin lines indicate cells stained with an unrelated isotype control antibody instead of the anti-PAF-r antibody. (b) Dose dependence of fosfomycin. Two hours before RSV infection, fosfomycin or PDTC was added at the indicated concentration. After a 24-h infection, the expression levels of the PAF-r were determined by flow cytometry as in (a). PDTC, an NF-kB inhibitor, was used as a control. (c) Fosfomycin treatment schedule. Two hours before, simultaneously with, or 4 or 12 h after RSV infection, fosfomycin was added at a concentration of 100 mg mL \u00c01 . After 24 h of infection, the expression level of the PAF-r was analyzed by flow cytometry as in (a).",
