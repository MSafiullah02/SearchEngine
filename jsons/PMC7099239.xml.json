            "text": "The German physician and statesman Rudolf Virchow (Figure 1) is universally recognized as the Founder of Modern Medicine. The son of a butcher, Virchow noted the link between diseases of humans and animals and coined the term \u2018zoonosis\u2019 to indicate the infectious disease links between animal and human health. The concept was not uniformly appreciated during Virchow's lifetime. His interests evolved from a period of parallel human and animal microbial pathogen discovery by many others, including Koch and Pasteur during the early to mid-1800s. Indeed, creation of the discipline of pathology has been attributed to the microbe.1 Among Virchow's many interests was helminthology, and he described the life cycle of Trichinella spiralis in swine and its zoonotic consequences (trichinosis).2 In addition to being a clinician and insatiable comparative pathologist, he served in the German parliament as an outspoken advocate for public health. Several historical biographies of Virchow relate a possibly apocryphal anecdote in which he opposed Bismarck's excessive military budget, which angered Bismarck sufficiently to challenge Virchow to a duel. Virchow, being entitled to select the weapons, chose two pork sausages: a cooked sausage for himself and an uncooked one, loaded with Trichinella, for Bismarck.3, 4, 5",

Osler's first academic appointment was a lectureship in the Medical Faculty of McGill University in Montreal. He lectured to not only medical students but also veterinary students from the Montreal Veterinary College, which soon became affiliated with McGill. He demonstrated anatomy and pathology on a daily basis to the veterinary students. As an active participant in comparative pathology, he became vice president and later president of the Veterinary Medical Association. When the Veterinary School failed after several years, he continued within a Division of Comparative Medicine. His influence was felt in subsequent faculty appointments in Philadelphia, and then Baltimore. The Johns Hopkins Medical School Dean, William Welsh, who himself was a pathologist influenced by Osler and his veterinary contacts, suggested a study of mice to Livingood, a pathology fellow, that resulted in the most accurate description of mouse mammary tumors and their metastases available at that time (1896).9",

During the early 1900s, many Colleges of Veterinary Medicine closed and the emphasis in the remaining schools turned to agriculture. Ironically, as the concept of One Medicine was waning, the inbred laboratory mouse was born in 1907, just as the automobile was replacing the horse and buggy.",

Schwabe and others chronicle the increasingly arrogant, proprietary attitude of medical investigators who often expressed open disrespect for veterinarians.12 Inadvertently, much of this attitude was stimulated by the veterinary profession itself. Public sentiment for laboratory animal welfare built momentum in the 1960s, with the passage of the Animal Welfare Act in 1966. This act was intended to protect pet dogs and cats from theft, sale, or use in research or experimentation, and initiated standards for the humane treatment of dogs, cats and other animals by animal dealers and research facilities. As social pressure continued, the Animal Welfare Act was amended in 1970, 1976, 1985, 1990 and 2002. The Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued its own set of more rigorous standards and subscribed to compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Research Council of the National Academies in 1963, with subsequent revisions. Even higher voluntary standards were established by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International. The veterinary profession has been, and continues to be, intimately involved in developing these policies. This involvement, albeit appropriate, placed the veterinarian in the unenviable position as \u2018welfare police,\u2019 with resentment by scientists who naively wanted no restrictions on their research.",

The emphasis of veterinary medicine changed increasingly from serving society and public health to companion animal medicine, with rising emphasis on the \u2018human\u2013animal bond.\u2019 Rather than seizing a rich opportunity for One Medicine through biomedical research and the laboratory animal, veterinary schools tended to ignore specialization in laboratory animals, and the research that they foster, as irrelevant. Most schools did not even offer courses involving laboratory animals, unless within the context of \u2018pocket pets.\u2019 Specialized training in laboratory animal medicine and biomedical research generally took place in departments of Comparative Medicine in medical schools rather than in veterinary schools. However, laboratory animal welfare regulations increasingly diverted the efforts of veterinarians to service and support roles. The rising regulatory burden in animal-related research thus drained what little veterinary biomedical scientific manpower remained, with little left over for science. The result of these trends has been a generation lost among veterinary biomedical research scientists, consumption of veterinary talent for regulatory activity and relatively low value placed on research within the profession, except for research involving domestic animals. These trends are well documented in a 2004 National Academies report, National Need and Priorities for Veterinarians in Biomedical Research, in a 2005 report, Critical Needs for Research in Veterinary Science and other publications.15, 16",

The enormous growth of information that must be assimilated by today's pathology residents has diluted the historic emphasis on experimental pathology training. Residency training is increasingly detached from research training, and in many cases, when the two are linked, both are diluted. Most veterinary pathology residency programs are embedded within veterinary schools, with all of the prejudices and negative trends reflected on the discipline of pathology. In the mid-1960s, for example, the majority of articles published in the ACVP official journal, Veterinary Pathology, involved experimental pathology of animals of agricultural importance. Today, the majority of articles in Veterinary Pathology are case reports, documenting esoterica of companion and exotic animals. Most veterinary pathology residents eschew laboratory animal pathology for the more glamorous or relatively comfortable appeal of companion animal and wildlife diagnostic pathology.

For example, the United Kingdom has established the Comparative Clinical Science Foundation to fund comparative studies in cancer, aging and genetic disorders (http://www.onemedicine.org.uk/).

Many publications claim to illustrate neoplasms found in a new mutant mouse line. The illustrations have often shown hyperplasias, dysplasias, cystic lesions, lesions without invasion and apparent non-neoplastic lesions, for example, diverticulosis in the GI tract54 or other non-neoplastic lesions.53 One recurrent debate remains the gastrointestinal hyperplasias associated with Helicobacter sp. infections in immunologically impaired mice.52, 54, 55, 56 Ample evidence has been published that these gastrointestinal lesions, including crypt herniation through the smooth muscle, disappear with antibiotic treatment.54, 57 However, some authors have persisted in naming these dysplasias of repair as \u2018non-metastatic carcinomas\u2019.55",

Following several large-scale mouse mutagenesis programs and considerable growth in GEM created by individual laboratories, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has now started a huge \u2018Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP),\u2019 with the goal of knocking out every functional gene in the mouse genome.75 Similar large-scale efforts have been launched in Canada (NorCOMM: North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Project), Europe (EUCOMM: European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Programme) and Asia. These programs, now combined in the \u2018International Mouse Knockout Consortium,\u2019 are going to create a critical, but currently unmet, need for expert comparative pathologists. The US KOMP aims at developing 8500 new mouse strains by 2010. Some experts have estimated that 200,000 new strains will be available by 2015. Another consortium, the \u2018Complex Traits\u2019 Consortium, is developing even more mouse strains. The molecular geneticists are going wild. One can only guess at the scientific catastrophe that will result without enough adequately prepared pathologists.35 There are no proposals for pathology support of these massive studies.",

They recognized that \u2018spontaneous\u2019 diseases in mutant laboratory mice frequently resembled human disease. These comparative pathologists had the skill to correlate genomic change with microscopic appearances, in other words, function with structure. As the genetic details became known, it became increasingly clear that the diseases in mice were associated with the same genes as the comparable diseases in humans.25 With the advent of genetic modification producing cancer models, they recognized that tumors produced in GEM are different from the spontaneous tumors of mice. When genes associated with human cancers were inserted into the mouse, many resulting tumors are remarkable phenotypic copies of their human counterparts.37 Subsequently, many genes were recognized to produce \u2018signature\u2019 tumor phenotypes76, 77 which are reproducibly unique to the gene. These observations were the beginnings of what we refer to here as genomic pathology, that is, a new discipline of pathology concerned with comparative pathology involving specific genetic changes associated with disease including cancer in humans and animals especially mice.",
