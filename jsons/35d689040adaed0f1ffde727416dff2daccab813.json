A cancer simulation model can help integrate new knowledge to inform clinical and policy decisions. OncoSim-Breast is a breast cancer simulation model. This paper aims to describe the key assumptions in the OncoSim-Breast model and how well it reproduces more recent breast cancer trends and the observed effects in a randomized screening trial. Methods: The OncoSim-Breast model simulates the onset, growth and spread of invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ tumours. The model combines Canadian cancer incidence, mortality, screening program and cost data to project population-level outcomes. Users can change the model input to answer specific policy questions. Here we report three validation exercises. First, we compared the model's projected breast cancer incidence and stage distributions with the observed data in the Canadian Cancer Registry. Second, we compared OncoSim's projected breast cancer mortality with the Vital Statistics. Third, we replicated the UK Age trial to compare the model's projections with the trial's observed screening effects.",

Randomized trials are the gold standard of evidence to introduce new interventions in clinical practice and public health; however, such evidence is not always relevant for informing policy decisions because the context of the interventions evolves quickly compared to the time that elapses between the design of a trial and the availability of its results. For example, most breast cancer screening randomized trials were from the era before breast cancer adjuvant treatment was available and used film-screen mammography1,2; breast cancer survival has since vastly improved3 and digital mammography has superseded film-screen mammography. A cancer simulation model can help integrate evidence from multiple sources and make them more relevant to inform contemporary clinical and policy decisions. Several groups have developed sophisticated cancer-specific models based on the natural history of cancer that can be revised for additional analyses and incorporate knowledge from experts in different areas4.",

Other established breast cancer simulation models have validated their predictions against the UK trial results34. We simulated a cohort of women born in 1950-1957 to match the birth cohort in the UK Age trial in two scenarios: (i) no screening; and (ii) annual screening for women age 40-49. In the screening scenario, we calibrated the rescreening rate to the average number of mammograms per woman in the Age trial (4.8)33. For each scenario, we estimated the incidence of breast cancer and breast cancer deaths in women aged 40-49 years. We then compared OncoSim Breast's projected incidence of breast cancer (DCIS and invasive cancers) with the trial's mean estimate and its 95% confidence interval. For breast cancer mortality, we compared the mortality reduction ratio from OncoSim Breast with the trial's mean estimate and 95% confidence interval over a 17 years follow-up period. We chose to compare rate ratios rather than rates because the populations were different: volunteers in the UK Age trial vs. Canadian population.",

When estimating the impact of screening on breast cancer deaths, OncoSim's projection was also within the confidence interval of the observed trial estimate. Over a 17 years follow-up period, OncoSim estimated that annual breast cancer screening in women age 40-49 years had an 85% relative risk of breast cancer death (i.e. 15% reduction), as compared with 88% (95% CI: 74%-104%) ",

First, OncoSim is a simulation model built using the best available data; the accuracy of projections depends on the quality of data input and the validity of assumptions. To address the issue of rapidly emerging evidence, OncoSim-Breast allows users to modify the inputs and assumptions. Second, our validation exercise comparing OncoSim-Breast's projections with more recent Canadian Cancer Registry data was limited by the availability and quality of data in the Registry. Third, our simulation of the UK Age trial was an exploratory external validation exercise; we did not calibrate the model to match historically poorer breast cancer outcomes at that time. Fourth, OncoSim-Breast was built to be a multipurpose breast cancer simulation tool and could simulate many scenarios; therefore, it would not be feasible to validate all its possible projections against observed data. To ensure OncoSim-Breast's relevance for supporting policy decisions, the team compares OncoSim-Breast's projections with emerging real-world data and refines the model based on new evidence, on an ongoing basis. In the upcoming releases, examples of further enhancements will include adding emerging data on new screening modalities, costs of new treatments, and .

When projecting incidence, mortality and stage at diagnosis of breast cancer, OncoSim-Breast's estimates were close to the estimates reported in the Canadian Cancer Registry and Vital Statistics. In addition, OncoSim-Breast's ability to reproduce the observed effects of annual breast cancer screening in a randomized screening trial increases the confidence of using the model results to inform breast cancer screeningrelated policy decisions. Building upon the experience of other OncoSim models and another established breast cancer microsimulation model3, OncoSim-Breast was developed using Canadian data. While the model has many potential applications, its primary purpose was to evaluate the impact of interventions related to early detection, such as promoting breast cancer awareness through professional and public education and screening. For screening, the model has many detailed outputs for informing policy decisions, including the harm of screening (e.g. false-positives and overdetection), healthcare costs, and benefits (life-year gained, cancer incidence and mortality, and quality-adjusted life-years). Jurisdictions planning the implementation of population-based screening can compare the impact of different screening strategies. For jurisdictions that have an organized breast cancer screening program in place, OncoSim-Breast could help investigate emerging issues such as increasing false-positives and customizing screening protocols based on different risk factors. In addition, jurisdictions can use the model to assess the impact of service disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, they can estimate the impact of pausing screening for various time intervals on the stage of diagnosis and breast cancer deaths. They can also compare the impact of different strategies for restoring screening programs on downstream resources, such as follow-up diagnostics, biopsies and surgeries.",

It is unique in that it is available at no charge to users in the public sector. The model comes with pre-populated inputs to facilitate analyses. Through an online platform with 24/7 access, users can create unique scenarios by modifying one or more of the model inputs and export OncoSim's projections for further analyses. In addition to peer-reviewed publications, its projections have been used to inform clinical practice guidelines, Canadian Cancer Statistics reports, and other national and jurisdictional-level cancer control decisions21-25.
