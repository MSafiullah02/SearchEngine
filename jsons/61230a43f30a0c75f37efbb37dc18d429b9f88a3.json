Because of this, it is necessary quick and precise diagnosis test. The current gold standard is the RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identification, but its results takes too long to be available. Tests base on IgM/IgG antibodies have been used, but their sensitivity and specificity may be very low. Many studies have been demonstrating the Covid-19 impact in hematological parameters. This work proposes an intelligent system to support Covid-19 diagnosis based on blood testing. We tested several machine learning methods, and we achieved high classification performance: 95.159% \u00b1 0.693 of overall accuracy, kappa index of 0.903 \u00b1 0.014, sensitivity of 0.968 \u00b1 0.007, precision of 0.938 \u00b1 0.010 and specificity of 0.936 \u00b1 0.011. These results were achieved using classical and low computational cost classifiers, with Bayes Network being the best of them. In addition, only 24 blood tests were needed. This points to the possibility of a new rapid test with low cost. The desktop version of the system is fully functional and available for free use. *",

We used the database provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The database contains data from 5644 patients among them 559 patients were diagnosis with Covid-19 by using the gold standard method, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-75 PCR) (Kaggle, 2020) . More than one hundred laboratory exams are available in the database like blood counts and urine test. Thus, aiming to provide a quick diagnosis we performed the reduction of exams by choosing which tests are most relevant to the diagnosis. Firstly we made it by using attribute selection algorithms based on Evolutionary Search (ES) (Liang et al., 2000; Kim et al., 80 2000) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (Kennedy & Eberhart, 1995; Poli et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007) . In the following, we made a hand reduction aiming to obtain the lower test price, small period of time required to the exams to be ready and the lower amount of blood samples needed. Finally, we obtained a database with 24 blood tests. According to empirical information 1 , 85 these exams may have turnaround time of 30 to 60 minutes in an emergency 1 According to the Brazilian Society of Clinical Analysis, there is no reference document to establish standard turnaround times for the exams described above.",

This rule adjusts the synaptic weights in a way that the network output becomes closer to the expected output. This method usually uses an error backpropagation algorithm to adjust these weights.

In backpropagation phase, an error is calculate using the desired output and the output obtained in the previous phase. Then, the error is used to update the connection weights.

All tested configurations of Random Forest also showed good performance, with accuracies around 95% and kappa close to 0.90. Naive Bayes algorithm performed slightly worse than these others, but still achieving great results for both accuracy and kappa. SVM, MLP and Random Tree classifiers, on the other hand, achieved less impressive results, 500 with accuracies around 90% and kappa between 0.75 and 0.85. As for the data dispersion, it was slightly greater for kappa results, when compared to accuracy.",

By combining these blood tests results to analysis based on Artificial Intelligence, we were able to provide a robust, efficient and easily available system to diagnose Covid-19. We optimized the system by reducing the amount of required exams, based on their relevance to describe the diagnosis problem and on their price and avail-570 ability worldwide, specially in low-income communities.

The identification of these parameters can be essential to facilitate clinical care for each group of patients. In this sense, the development of intelligent systems based on blood tests is useful.Faced with the pandemic scenario, in which most hospitals are 185 full, decision support systems can facilitate clinical management. Thus, it can increase the assertiveness in the treatment for each case and, consequently, the number of lives saved. Gun\u010dar et al. (2018) proposed a system based on machine learning for analyzing blood tests and predicting hematological diseases. The models were 190 developed with data from the University Medical Center of Ljubljana, which were collected between the years 2005 and 2015. In this case, 43 diseases and 181 parameters or attributes were selected to generate a first model (SBA-HEM181). In addition to it, a second model with 61 parameters was also developed (SBA-HEM061). The selection of the smaller group was made according 195 to the frequency of use. Regarding the missing values (about 75%), the authors filled in with median values for each attribute. For the development of the intelligent system, classic classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Random Forest were tested, with the latter being chosen. The simulations were repeated 10 times using 10-fold cross validation. Finally, the models 200 SBA-HEM181 and SBA-HEM061 reached an accuracy of 57% considering all the diseases chosen. By restricting the prediction to five classes, the systems achieved an accuracy of 88% and 86%, respectively. These results pointed to the possibility of detecting diseases through blood tests using classic classifiers.",

Several studies have analyzed the clinical potential of these hematological parameters. Lippi & Plebani (2020) points out that many patients with Covid-19 do not have abnormal coagulation tests at the time of admission to the hospital. However, there is a gradual increase as the severity of 525 the disease increases. Wan et al. (2020) also detected cases of hypercoagulable state and secondary hyperfibrinolysis. These findings confirm that parameters such as the mean volume of platelets are important in identifying severe cases and predicting the risk of mortality(Tang et al., 2020a;Lippi et al., 2020).",
