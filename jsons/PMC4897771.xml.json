We compared epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, outcomes, and pathogens detected among children with neurologic disorders, non-neurologic underlying conditions, and no underlying conditions. Our primary outcome of clinical severity was intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We also examined other clinical outcomes including hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, invasive mechanical ventilation requirement and duration, receipt of vasopressors within 72 hours of ICU admission, and death. We performed bivariate and separate age-stratified analyses comparing the characteristics between children with neurologic disorders vs non-neurologic underlying conditions, and neurologic disorders vs no underlying conditions. In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses comparing the clinical outcomes of the subset of children with neurologic disorders and no other non-neurologic underlying conditions to the outcomes of children with non-neurologic underlying conditions and no underlying conditions; however, for our primary analysis, the neurologic disorders group includes children with a neurologic disorder who may also have non-neurologic disorders because there were few differences in the outcomes between these groups and because of sample size. We performed multivariable logistic regression using stepwise elimination to further investigate clinical outcomes found to be more common among children with neurologic disorders; covariates for the regression models were based on significance on bivariate analysis and epidemiologic or biological plausibility.",

Because age group was determined to be an effect modifier with neurologic disorders (P value <.01), we also created separate regression models stratified by age group; we excluded asthma/RAD from the <2-year-old age group because of the uncertainty of accurate diagnosis at that age. Using a stepwise elimination method, race/ethnicity and reports symptoms of seizures documented in the medical record fell out of the model and were removed from all final models. In separate multivariable logistic regression models stratified by age group, which included the presence of a neurologic disorder, asthma/RAD (in the 2- to 4-year-old and 5- to 17-year-old age groups only), congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, hypoxia, tachypnea, and the following interaction terms: neurologic disorder and congenital heart disease, congenital heart disease and hypoxia, asthma/RAD and hypoxia, asthma/RAD and tachypnea, neurologic disorder and chronic lung disease, asthma/RAD and chronic lung disease, hypoxia and chronic lung disease, tachypnea and chronic lung disease, and hypoxia and tachypnea; none of the interactions in the age-stratified multivariate models was significant.

However, on multivariate analysis the association between neurologic disorder and ICU admission remained only for children \u22652 years of age. The reasons for this finding are not entirely clear and the EPIC dataset did not include reason for ICU admission. However, there are several possible reasons for this finding. First, it is possible that there was increased disability with increasing age or related to specific neurologic disorders, but we do not have detailed neurologic or functionality information in the EPIC dataset to assess this hypothesis. Second, it is possible that younger children with certain neurologic disorders, which were included in the case definition (such as epilepsy or developmental delay), may not have been fully diagnosed and, therefore, were not formally classified as having a neurologic disorder. Third, it is possible that children with neurologic disorders may have increasing disability with age because of their neurologic disorder alone (eg, impaired cough reflex) such that they were admitted to the ICU for aspiration risk and increased monitoring or treatment such as suctioning. Lastly, clinicians may have been more likely to admit all children younger than 2 years regardless of any underlying medical condition to the ICU for a respiratory admission for increased monitoring or treatment, thus, the effect of having a neurologic disorder would be decreased in this younger age group.",

Chaves et al23 found that among children hospitalized with influenza, children with neuromuscular disorders were more likely to have ICU admissions or death compared with those without neuromuscular conditions (11% vs 3%). Previous studies have highlighted the disproportionate number of episodes of respiratory failure and deaths in children with neurologic disorders hospitalized with influenza or RSV infections.16, 18, 20, 24, 25 We found that children with neurologic disorders required invasive mechanical ventilation with the same frequency as children with non-neurologic underlying conditions and children with no underlying conditions. Because we comprehensively and prospectively evaluated children hospitalized with CAP directly, we did not identify cases through preferential testing or severity criteria which may have contributed to the differences between our study and the various previously published studies.",

Although the reasons for these differences are unclear and warrant further investigation, there are several possible explanations. More frequent aspiration without a discernible pathogen but still with clinical and radiographic pneumonia, may have contributed to the lower frequency of pathogen detection among children with neurologic disorders; the EPIC study did not systematically collect sputum or endotracheal aspirate specimens in the children to further assess this possibility.9, 11, 14, 15 It is also possible that because pathogens were less frequently detected in older children overall,3 that the finding of fewer pathogens detected in children with neurologic disorders may be related to their older age compared with children with non-neurologic underlying conditions and no underlying conditions. Interestingly and specifically rhinovirus, adenovirus, and RSV were all less frequently detected in children with neurologic disorders compared with children with non-neurologic medical conditions, of which asthma/RAD was most common; although we did not further stratify by underlying medical condition, these viruses have been associated with asthma and RAD in previous studies.26, 27 Importantly, respiratory virus detections were more common than bacterial detections among children with neurologic disorders, as was also true for all other children hospitalized with CAP. In addition, the frequency of co-detections and specific pathogens detected were generally similar in all 3 groups.",

Thus, we were unable to classify the degree of disability or ability to manage secretions caused by different neurologic disorders and the potential impact on outcomes. Similarly, we acknowledge that the neurologic disorders group is heterogeneous, but we used definitions that have been reported previously. In addition, in the assessment of specific disorders, although our numbers were small in any 1 group, the clinical outcomes of the overall population of children with neurologic disorders and those of the subset of children with neurologic disorders and no other comorbidities were similar. Second, children with preexisting tracheostomy were excluded from this study, which may have excluded some of the children who are most severely neurologically compromised who have the highest risk for pneumonia. Third, aspiration can occur frequently in children with neurologic disorders,14, 15, 33 and it is possible that the lower proportion of pathogens detected in children with neurologic disorders was related to aspiration pneumonia when an etiologic agent was not detected. Sputum samples were not collected routinely in the children, and very few endotracheal aspirates were obtained in our study. Fourth, although we used a comprehensive array of diagnostic methods, detection of a pathogen does not necessarily denote causation.3 Fifth, we did not have data on the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, thus, we are unable to describe all potential forms of respiratory support that may have been used during hospitalization. Sixth, the threshold and reasons for ICU admission vary among clinicians and institutions and, thus, have limitations as a marker for severity. Although we did not collect information on reason for ICU admission, we did find that most children admitted to the ICU had tachypnea, hypoxia, or altered mental status; however, there may be other factors, including clinician preferences or other nonclinical factors, for which we did not account. Finally, our study sites were tertiary care children's hospitals, and the array of neurologic disorders and overall medical complexity in these patients may differ from those seen in nonreferral centers. This may have had a limited effect, however, because patients with more complex neurologic disorders would likely be referred to specialty centers regardless of the acute illness.13\n",
