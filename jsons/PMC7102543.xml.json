As the largest known RNA viruses, CoVs are further divided into four genera: alpha-coronavirus, beta- coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). To date, there have been six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) identified, including the alpha-CoVs HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta-CoVs HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2020), and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012). New coronaviruses appear to emerge periodically in humans, mainly due to the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses, the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of their genomes, and the increase of human-animal interface activities (Cui et al., 2019, Zhu et al., 2019).",

The epidemics in the Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan have been became the greatest concern of WHO (WHO and WHO, 2020). According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (European-Centre-for-Disease-Prevention-and-Control, 2020), regarding the latest daily risk assessment on COVID-19, March 2, the ECDC has now considered the risk moderate to high level. The case fatality rate of the currently reported cases in China is less than 4%, which implies that so far, this novel coronavirus does not seem to cause the high fatality rates previously observed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 10% and 37%, respectively (Chaolin et al., 2020). According to the latest data, a total of 36167 cases were reported in Hubei, China, which gives a cumulative attack rate (CAA) of 0.11% (the permanent resident population of Hubei is about 59, 170,000).

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the family coronaviruses, which is the beta-CoV with over 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-nCoV (Cheng and Shan, 2019). Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats, but it requires further confirmation of whether pneumonia infection by the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted directly from bats or through an intermediate host (Another Decade, 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Recent research has found that the virus is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, which means bats are the most possible host of the SARS-CoV-2 (Another Decade, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Also, Ji and colleagues (Ji et al., 2020) demonstrated that snakes are a possible virus reservoir for human infection. Zhu et al. (Cheng and Shan, 2019) indicated that bats and minks maybe two potential hosts of the novel coronavirus, while minks may be the intermediate hosts of this virus. Subsequently, studies have shown that pangolins are potential intermediate hosts, but in general, there may be multiple intermediate hosts (Lam et al., 2020). For many viruses, one of the key steps in the emergence process is the jump from animals to humans. Thus, identifying the source of the virus will help control its spread (Another Decade, 2020).",

            "text": "Chan and colleagues (Fuk-Woo et al., 2020) reported a case of five patients in a family cluster, which confirmed person-to-person transmission of CoVID-19. Health officials have identified evidence of transmission along a chain of 4 \u201cgenerations\u201d (a person who originally contracted the virus from a nonhuman source infected someone else, who infected another individual, who then infected another individual), suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission (Phelan and RebeccaKatz, 2020, WHO, 2020). Up to the present, the main infection source was the patients with pneumonia infected by SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, and it can also be transmitted through aerial droplets and contact (Jin et al., 2020). However, we also should attach importance to asymptomatic cases, which may play a critical role in the transmission process (Shen et al., 2020). Recently, new coronavirus was detected in the feces of confirmed patients in Wuhan, Shenzhen and even the first case in the United States, indicating that the virus can exist and replicate in the digestive tract, suggesting the possibility of fecal-oral transmission (Holshue et al., 2020), but it is not certain that eating virus-contaminated food causes infection and transmission. There were also views that viruses in feces may be re-transmitted by aerosol formation of virus-containing droplets, requiring further investigation. At present, there is no evidence for aerosol transmission of CoVID-19. WHO also believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission (WHO, 2020). In addition, it has been reported that a mother was diagnosed with the new type of coronavirus pneumonia, and her newborn was positive for viral nucleic acid in pharynx swabs after 30 hours of birth (CCTV.COM, 2020), suggesting that the new type of coronavirus may cause neonatal infection through mother-to-child transmission, which of course needs to be confirmed by more scientific studies (Zhu et al., 2020).",

(2020a) analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan and found the R0 to be 2.2, without specifying their modelling method. Jonathan Read and his colleagues (Cheng and Shan, 2019) from Lancaster University used a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) metapopulation transmission model to determine the R0 to be around 3.1. Majumder and colleagues (Maimuna, 2020) used the Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model to estimate the R0 to be 2.0\u20133.3 (the study did not publish yet, available at SSRN). Recently, a large group of researchers from multiple institutes led by Jianhong Wu from York University (Tang et al., 2020) proposed a more general deterministic SEIR compartmental model using more parameters, and arrived at a much higher R0 number of 6.47. Recent research (Zhang et al., 2020) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, at a looser intervention and quarantine condition, showed the R0 was 2.28, and if the R0 were reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated cumulative cases would be reduced from 1514 to 1081 and 758, also proving that intense quarantine and social distancing measures should be taken to control the outbreak.",

With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3\u201319), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4\u20133.9) (Li et al., 2020a). While Guan et al.

The median incubation period of CoVID-19 ARD was 3.0 days and it had a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS and MERS (Wang et al., 2019), while the estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV infection was 4.6 days (95% CI, 3.8\u20135.8 days) (Chiu et al., 2003) and 95% of illness onset occurred within 10 days (DC et al., 2003). The mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization was between 2 and 8 days, but was shorter toward the later phase of the epidemic. The mean time from symptom onset to need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and to death was 11 and 23.7 days, respectively (Leung et al., 2020).",

About half of the patients had dyspnea (the median from onset to dyspnea was 8 days). Lymphocytopenia was observed in 63% of patients. All patients had pneumonia. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (29%), acute heart injury (12%), and secondary infections (10%); 32% of patients required treatment in the ICU. An analysis of 1099 confirmed cases (up to 29 January) conducted by NanShan Zhong\u2019s team (Weijie et al., 2020) found that the most common symptoms were fever (87.9%), cough (67.7%), diarrhea (3.7%) and vomiting (5.0%). 25.2% of the patients had at least one underlying disease (such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Lymphocytopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. On admission, 50% of the patients presented ground-glass shadow on chest CT. A retrospective study (Wang et al., 2019) of 138 hospitalized patients from January 1 to 28 found that patients receiving treatment in the ICU were older, more likely to have underlying diseases, and more likely to have dyspnea, and the median length of stay was 10 days (Wang et al., 2019). Recent studies indicate that patients\u226560 years of age are at higher risk than children who might be less likely to become infected or, if so, may show milder symptoms or even asymptomatic infection (Li et al., 2020a). Epidemiology Working Group for NCIP Epidemic Response of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Working, 2020), with a total of 72,314 patients, reported that there were 44,672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%) among the total number of patients.

Severe cases can further develop to bilateral multiple ground-glass opacity, infiltrating shadows, and pulmonary consolidation, with infrequent pleural effusion. Chest CT scan: Pulmonary lesions are shown more clearly by CT than X-ray examination, including ground-glass opacity and segmental consolidation in bilateral lungs, especially in the lung periphery. In children with severe infection, multiple lobar lesions may be present in both lungs. A study of CT scans of 21 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed three (21%) with normal CT scans, 12 (57%) with ground-glass opacity only, and six (29%) with ground-glass opacity and consolidation at presentation (Chung et al., 2020). Another study of 41 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported to have bilateral lung involvement on chest radiographs (Chaolin et al., 2020). Overall, the imaging findings reported for CoVID-19 are similar to those reported with SARS (Nicolaouet al., 2003; Ooi et al., 2004) and MERS (Das et al., 2015; DK et al., 2015), not surprising as the responsible viruses are also coronaviruses.",

At the moment, we know relatively little about CoVID-19, except that it is a highly pathogenic human pathogen, possibly a zoonotic agent. Now that a pandemic has occurred, it is critical that countries around the world take steps to stop transmission and save lives. In addition, we should actively study its origin, tropism, and pathogenesis with the aim of providing some guidance in dealing with this rapidly spreading epidemic. Challenges remain in several key areas, including the recent cases of people who have tested positive for the virus. Can these cured patients still transmit to others? All of these suggest that we should develop more detailed criteria for the prevention and control of the virus, and more stringent criteria for discharge of patients after treatment.",
