We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy.",

It is predicted that the development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 will take 12 to 18 months, by which time many millions of people may have been infected. With a rapidly growing number of cases and deaths around the world, such emerging threats require a nimble and targeted means of protection. Because coronaviruses causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are able to spontaneously transfer to humans from diverse animal hosts that act as viral reservoirs, there is a pressing need to develop methods to broadly combat other coronaviruses that may emerge in the future (Li et al., 2005; Mohd et al., 2016; Shi and Hu, 2008) . A recent report showed two strains (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2 with different genomic sequences are circulating and likely evolving, further highlighting the need for a pan-coronavirus targeting strategy (Tang et al., 2020) .",

The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is likely similar to the closely related coronavirus that causes SARS, in which the virus enters the cell, releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm, and synthesizes negative-sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs from which viral mRNAs and new copies of the positive sense viral genome are synthesized ( Figure 1A ) (Du et al., 2009; Liu, 2014) . Whereas most ongoing vaccine trials work by priming the human immune system to recognize coronavirus proteins or attenuated viruses and decrease viral entry into cells (Rappuoli, 2018) , the alternative antiviral approach we propose here relies on a CRISPR-based system for recognizing and degrading the intracellular viral genome and its resulting viral mRNAs ( Figure 1B ). Targeting the positive-sense genome and viral mRNAs to simultaneously degrade viral genome templates for replication and viral gene expression would be expected to robustly limit viral replication.",

Cas13d employs CRISPR-associated RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a customizable 22-nt spacer sequence that can direct the Cas13d protein to specific RNA molecules for targeted RNA degradation. The high catalytic activity of Cas13d in human cells provides a potential mechanism for targeting SARS-CoV-2 for specific viral RNA genome degradation and viral gene expression inhibition. Because of its small size (967 amino acids), high specificity, and strong catalytic activity, we chose Cas13d rather than other Cas13 proteins to target and destroy RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) (Gootenberg et al., 2018; Smargon et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2018) . While this is not the first study to use a Cas13 variant to target viral sequences in human cells (Bawage et al., 2018; Freije et al., 2019) , it remains unknown whether CRISPR tools can be designed to effectively target and cleave SARS-CoV-2 sequences. In addition, our approach differs from previous studies in that we aim to develop a strategy for simultaneously targeting multiple species of viruses within the same family to provide broad, pan-coronavirus protection.",

We created a bioinformatic pipeline to define highly conserved regions across many sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes and target these regions using CRISPR-Cas13d for viral sequence degradation. At the time of manuscript submission, we were unable to gain access to live SARS-CoV-2 strains. Therefore, we tested our approach using synthesized fragments A B (+) (A) A hypothetical life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Upon SARS-CoV-2 entry and genome RNA release, the positive strand RNA genome serves as a template to make negative strand genomic and subgenomic templates, which are used to produce more copies of the positive strand viral genome and viral mRNAs. (B) Cas13d can inhibit viral function and replication by directly targeting and cleaving all viral positive-sense RNA. ll of SARS-CoV-2, as well as with live infection using an H1N1 IAV strain in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a panel of crRNA pools targeting conserved viral regions and defined the most effective crRNAs. We demonstrated the ability of our approach to cleave SARS-CoV-2 fragments and to reduce the amount of IAV infection in human lung epithelial cells. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed a group of six crRNAs that can target 91% of sequenced coronaviruses, as well as a group of 22 crRNAs able to target all sequenced coronaviruses. Through the use of crRNA pools targeting different regions of the same virus or different strains of coronavirus, this system could possibly buffer against viral evolution and escape as well as be used to protect against future related pathogenic viruses. While there are remaining hurdles to overcome before this strategy can be used clinically, PAC-MAN has the potential to become a new antiviral strategy.",

We found that the RdRP-or N-targeting crRNAs were able to repress their corresponding reporters by 81% (p = 0.01) or 90% (p = 5 3 10 \u00c04 ), respectively ( Figures 3E and S3A ). Our analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition was more sensitive to crRNA concentration in our samples, while lower Cas13d expression only moderately decreased inhibitory activity ( Figure S3B) . Thus, maintaining a high level of crRNA concentration is likely a determining factor for more effective SARS-CoV-2 Table S2 for the designed crRNA sequences and synthesized SARS-CoV-2 fragments.

In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which has only a single, continuous RNA genome, the IAV genome is contained in eight negative-sense RNA segments, in which each plays an important role in packaging the viral RNA into budding virions (Breen et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2009) . Previous work has shown that IAV can be inhibited using Cas13b in A549 and MDCK cells at a low MOI by targeting somewhat conserved regions (up to 2 bases with <95% allele frequency per crRNA) (Freije et al., 2019) .

Due to the conserved nature of the segment ends, targeting with Cas13d could potentially inhibit a broad range of IAV strains. Additionally, previous work has shown that interfering with the packaging of one segment decreases the packaging efficiency of other segments, and thus the overall virion packaging.

Using sequence representation from $140 different strains of influenza, we designed crRNAs that could robustly target as many different IAV strains as possible. Our bioinformatics analysis resulted in six crRNAs targeting highly conserved genome regions for each of the eight IAV segments, for a total of 48 crRNAs (Table S2) .",

To do this, we transfected a pool of six crRNAs targeting a given IAV genome segment. Two days after crRNA transfection, the Cas13d A549 cells were challenged with PR8-mNeon, a strain of H1N1 IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) engineered to express the mNeonGreen gene, a fluorescent reporter protein (hereafter referred to as PR8-mNeon) at an MOI of 2.5 or 5.0 Heaton et al., 2017; Shaner et al., 2013) . At approximately 18 h post-challenge, the cells were analyzed for IAV infection through flow cytometry and microscopy. We examined the percentage of cells that were mNeon positive for each segment-targeting crRNA pool and calculated the fold-change compared to cells transfected with a pool of nontargeting crRNAs). Notably, our study used high MOIs (2.5 or 5) compared to previous Cas13 work that used an MOI of 0.1 or 0.01 (Bawage et al., 2018; Freije et al., 2019) . A high MOI is required to get an appropriate dynamic range to detect inhibition of IAV by flow cytometry and allows for the evaluation of crRNA robustness under stringent high-titer infection conditions.",

Our analysis revealed that a group of 81 crRNAs could cover all 91,600 IAVs, with a minimal group of six crRNAs targeting 92% of IAV genomes ( Figure 4D , Table  S4 ).

Thus, the design of a strategy that could broadly target and prevent viral threats, including all coronavirus strains that currently reside in animals, would be an invaluable resource. We asked whether it is possible to design a minimal number of crRNAs that could target a majority of known coronaviruses found in both humans and animals. In contrast to previous Cas13 antiviral work (Freije et al., 2019) , which focused on conservation across different strains for the same species of virus, we sought to target as many strains as possible with a minimal set of crRNAs to create an even broader level of protection against a given family of viruses.",

We refined this list to identify the smallest number of crRNAs that could target all known coronavirus genomes with zero mismatches. We found that just two crRNAs could target $50% of coronavirus genomes, including those causing COVID-19, SARS, and MERS; six crRNAs were able to target $91% of coronavirus genomes; and 22 crRNAs covered all sequenced coronaviruses with no mismatches ( Figure 5B ; Table S4 ). The ability to use a relatively small number of crRNAs to broadly target See also Figure S4 and Tables S2 and S4. most or all coronavirus strains further highlights the unique power of our method in contrast to traditional pharmaceutical or vaccination approaches. As a resource, we provide a map to show how the top six crRNAs (PAC-MAN-T6) target the coronavirus phylogenetic tree ( Figure 5A , red box). Beta coronaviruses, the genus of viruses causing COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, were mainly covered by three crRNAs (crRNA 1-3), while the other genera were covered by crRNA 1-3 in addition to three other crRNAs. This minimal set of six crRNAs includes one crRNA (designated crRNA-N18f) ( Table S2 ) that has been validated as part of a pool in our work. Altogether, the PAC-MAN-T6 can target all known human coronaviruses with broad coverage against other animal coronaviruses.",

In addition, our bioinformatics analyses suggested that minimal pools of six crRNAs are able to target 92% of 91,600 IAV strains and six crRNAs are able to target 91% of 3,051 sequenced coronaviruses. This expands the applications of CRISPR-Cas13 systems beyond diagnostics, such as SHERLOCK, and live-cell RNA imaging (Gootenberg et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) . For both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, we found highly conserved regions of the viral genome to target with Cas13d. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these genomic regions encode the RdRP and nucleocapsid proteins, which are essential for coronavirus replication and function (Chan et al., 2020; McBride et al., 2014) . RdRP is responsible for catalyzing the replication of all viral mRNAs and nucleocapsid binds to genomic RNA, protecting it and serving as one of the two main structural proteins in virions. Targeted inhibition of these proteins could have an outsized effect on disabling virus production and function, in addition to reducing viral load through degradation of the viral genome itself. When targeting IAV, the crRNAs that showed the best viral inhibition target the conserved ends of the segment S6 that encodes NA, a viral surface protein essential for mediating budding of new virions (McAuley et al., 2019) . Prior mutation analysis has shown that mutating the packaging signals of one segment end leads to decreased packaging of other segments, indicating that there is a cooperative mechanism for packaging the IAV genome (Muramoto et al., 2006) . Thus, by inhibiting a single IAV genome segment, we could reduce the overall packaging of IAV in a synergistic fashion.",

One immediate next step will be to validate the efficiency and specificity of crRNAs for inhibiting infection of respiratory tract cells with live SARS-CoV-2 virus. While we tested the PAC-MAN system as a prophylactic system that is introduced before viral challenge, we hypothesize that PAC-MAN could also be used to reduce viral load after infection, and this will also be important to examine. In future tests, our crRNA selection strategy could be combined with recently published algorithms that predict crRNA efficiency to further streamline the crRNA validation process (Wessels et al., 2020) . The crRNAs that are selected to be tested therapeutically will need to be evaluated for off-target effects experimentally such as using whole transcriptome RNA sequencing. Furthermore, while we demonstrate that the PAC-MAN system is able to inhibit viral sequences in vitro, therapeutic use will require an effective in vivo delivery method into human respiratory tract cells. Finally, PAC-MAN will need to be validated in relevant preclinical models such as ferrets or rhesus macaques, or primary human lung/airway organoid models to test its antiviral efficacy and specificity (Huh et al., 2010) . Animal models will also provide information related to Cas13dinduced immunogenicity, an issue that has arisen in studies of CRISPR-Cas9 (Mehta and Merkel, 2020) . These steps, including clinical trials, will likely take years; while PAC-MAN will not be able to stem the current rising tide of COVID-19 cases and related deaths, there is potential for it to be used against future viral threats.",

DNA-based liposomal delivery strategies, such as lipitoids or the recently developed HEDGES platform, are also attractive (Handumrongkul et al., 2019; Huang et al., 1998) . Another strategy would be to deliver a ribonucleoprotein complex containing the Cas13d protein assembled with crRNAs (Amirkhanov and Stepanov, 2019; Xu et al., 2019) . Other work successfully used engineered amphiphilic peptides to deliver Cas9-guide RNA complexes to airway epithelia, which provides a promising approach for delivering PAC-MAN Cas13d complexes (Krishnamurthy et al., 2019) . In addition, recent advances in gene therapy delivery strategies optimized for cystic fibrosis that can deliver mRNA or plasmid DNA, such as self-assembled peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles, may also be an option (Guan et al., 2019) . We anticipate that one of the above-mentioned strategies can potentially be administered to patients or healthy populations via a nebulizer system or nasal spray as an antiviral strategy.",

For instance, PAC-MAN acts in a cell-autonomous manner, meaning that only cells that express Cas13d and crRNAs are directly protected against the targeted viruses. For PAC-MAN to be effective in patients, it needs to be able to be sufficiently expressed in a certain percentage of cells, the range of which would need to be determined experimentally. In addition, our own work has shown that SARS-CoV-2 sequence cleavage efficiency is sensitive to crRNA expression ( Figure S3B ). The ability to tune the levels of Cas13d and its cognate crRNAs in the cell may be important to achieving efficient viral inhibition. As another consideration, viral genomes may be less susceptible to inhibition due to the secondary structure of the RNA genome or coating with protective proteins. To address this, high-throughput screening of crRNAs may help identify highly effective crRNAs targeting live SARS-CoV-2. With optimization and further testing, these limitations may prove surmountable.",

The potential for pan-coronavirus protection using CRISPR-Cas13d offers an alternative and complementary approach over traditional pharmaceuticals or vaccines. Traditional vaccines rely on priming the immune system through exposure to viral proteins or peptides often derived from surface proteins that exhibit a high rate of mutation, which increases the chances of viral evasion of the host immune response (Carrat and Flahault, 2007) . In contrast, here, we have demonstrated a genetic strategy that is able to target highly conserved regions, which would be expected to make it much less likely for the virus to escape inhibition through mutation. In addition, the ability of Cas13d to process its own crRNAs from a crRNA array means that multiple crRNAs targeting different regions (e.g., Figure 3E , and PAC-MAN-T6 in Figure 5A ) could be delivered simultaneously (Konermann et al., 2018) , further reducing the chances of viral escape. As a further advantage, we demonstrate a potential pan-coronavirus strategy to target not only viruses that circulate in humans, but also those that are found in animal reservoirs. If the crRNAs targeting these viruses can be tested and validated before they ever infect humans, we can greatly accelerate the development of countermeasures for future emergent threats.",

To design all possible crRNAs for the three pathogenic RNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV), the reference genomes of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, along with SARS-CoV-2 genomes derived from 47 patients were first aligned by MAFFT using the-auto flag. crRNA candidates were identified by using a sliding window to extract all 22-nucleotide (nt) sequences with perfect identity among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We annotated each crRNA candidate with the number of mismatches relative to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes, as well as the GC content. 3,802 crRNA candidates were selected that perfectly matched the 47 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and with % 1 mismatch to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV sequences. To characterize the specificity of 22-nt crRNAs, we ensured that crRNA do not target any sequences in the human transcriptome. We used Bowtie 1.2.2 to align crRNAs to the human transcriptome (HG38; including non-coding RNA) and removed crRNAs that mapped to the human transcriptome with 2 or fewer mismatches.",

A hash table was used to map each crRNA candidate to the number of Coronavirinae genomes that it targets with a perfect match. A greedy algorithm was used to identify a minimal set of covering crRNAs. In each iteration, the crRNAs were sorted in descending order by the number of genomes targeted. The crRNA that targeted the most genomes was added to the minimal set of crRNAs, and all of the genomes it targeted were removed from the hash table values. If multiple crRNAs were tied for targeting the most genomes, the crRNAs were ranked by the length and quantity of stretches of repeated nucleotides, and the lowest ranking crRNA (i.e., the one with the fewest, shortest stretches of repeated nucleotides) was added to the set of minimal crRNAs. Using this approach, a set of 22 crRNAs were identified that were able to target all 3,051 Coronavirinae virus genomes (including 47 SARS-CoV-2). The phylogenetic tree and the associated annotations were generated by the Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL v5.5; https://itol.embl.de/).",

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the PrimePCR assay with the SYBR Green Master Mix (BioRad) and run on a Biorad CFX384 real-time system (C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler), according to manufacturers' instructions. Cq values were used to quantify RNA abundance. The relative abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 fragments was normalized to a GAPDH internal control. To calculate the relative mRNA abundance, the expression of each treatment relative to GAPDH was normalized by setting the average value in reporter only samples as 1.",
