MERS-CoV is a kind of novel enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which can cause severe respiratory complications and renal failure in infected patients [2], [4]. Although most MERS-CoV infections occurred in the Middle East, cases have been reported in Europe, North America, and Asia through people traveling from the Middle East or their contacts [5]. Since May 2015, the Republic of Korea has newly been affected, causing the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula [6]; this highlighted the importance of a surveillance system to prevent further spread [7]. Simultaneously, China increased its efforts to detect MERS-CoV because of an imported case of MERS from Korea, which was a threat to public health [8]. Hence, rapid and effective diagnosis of the infectious agent is crucial for the timely control and management of this disease.",

Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an updated interim guidance for laboratory testing of MERS-CoV [12]. Three assays for diagnosing MERS-CoV infections have been developed, which were based on the detection of specific regions of viral RNA by rRT-PCR. The tests include an assay targeting upstream of the envelope gene (upE) [10], which is highly sensitive and recommended for laboratory screening, followed by confirmation with assays targeting either the open reading frame 1b (ORF 1b) [10] or 1a (ORF 1a) [11]. Meanwhile, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) developed rRT-PCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of MERS-CoV to complement the upE and ORF 1a/1b assays during screening and confirmation [6], [13]. Additionally, confirmation for the screening test can be aided by partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or N gene [11].",

EQA can help improve the diagnostic capability of laboratories and find the best solution to solve existing problems, such as low detection sensitivity for samples with lower viral concentrations.
