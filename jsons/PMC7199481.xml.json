Sepsis is a systemic illness caused by microbial invasion, whereas endotoxaemia occurs when endotoxin, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram\u2010negative bacteria, is present in the systemic circulation [2]. Sepsis presents more challenges than endotoxaemia because bacteria express many cell surface molecules or pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including LPS, bacterial lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan and bacterial DNA, many of which may be present in the circulation at one time. Traditionally, Gram\u2010negative bacteria have been associated with sepsis; however, in humans, Gram\u2010positive bacteria may be equally important in disease pathogenesis [3, 4, 5]. In equine neonatal sepsis, both Gram\u2010negative and Gram\u2010positive bacterial isolates have been identified as causative agents [6, 7, 8, 9], and Gram\u2010positive bacteria are increasingly being isolated from neonatal and adult animals [8, 9, 10, 11].",

Activation of PRRs by PAMPs triggers the production of pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory mediators, as well as initiating adaptive immune responses. Pattern recognition receptors include Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs), lectin receptors, Retinoic acid inducible gene I\u2010like receptors and nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)\u2010like receptors (NLRs) and may reside on the cell surface, in the endoplasmic reticulum, in endosomes, lysosomes, endolysosomes or the cytosol [12]. Successful activation of PRRs is critical in order for bacterial infections to be cleared successfully by the host, but overactivation of these receptors can lead to systemic inflammation and shock\u2010like syndromes. Antagonism of PRRs therefore represents an exciting new therapeutic target for clinical syndromes such as sepsis and endotoxaemia [13].",

            "text": "Toll\u2010like receptor 4 (TLR4), the first fully characterised mammalian PRR, recognises the lipid A component of LPS and is the receptor activated during endotoxaemia [17]. Mice without TLR4 are more susceptible to Gram\u2010negative bacterial infections [18]. The structure of LPS bound to TLR4 and its co\u2010receptor myeloid differentiation protein\u20102 (MD2) has been solved [19]. First LPS is extracted from plasma by lipopolysaccharide binding protein [20]; the lipid A is then transferred to CD14 [21], which then transfers it to TLR4 and MD2 [22]. Each bacterial species produces a structurally unique lipid A, which affects its efficacy at TLR4 [15]. Variant lipid A structures are recognised in a mammalian species\u2010specific manner. Lipid As from Salmonella entericia serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) or Escherichia coli are agonists in all species; the E. coli partial structure lipid IVa is an antagonist in humans [23], a partial agonist in horses [24] and a full agonist in mice [25]. Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A is an antagonist in humans and mice [26], but is an agonist in horse cells [18]. The species specificity in TLR4 ligand recognition, particularly in the horse, is becoming increasingly well understood and is dependent on subtle structural differences in MD2 and TLR4 [24]. Also, TLR4 recognises a number of other ligands, including respiratory syncytial virus fusions proteins, mouse mammary tumour virus envelope proteins, Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin and the plant\u2010derived cytostatic drug paclitaxel [27], although precisely how these PAMPs bind to the receptor is unclear. The importance of LPS in equine diseases such as acute abdominal disease [28, 29], adynamic post operative ileus [30], laminitis [31], exertion [32], neonatal sepsis [33, 34] and recurrent airway obstruction [35, 36, 37, 38] has been the subject of extensive research efforts, particularly with respect to colic. This makes the TLR4\u2013MD2 receptor complex an attractive therapeutic target for a number of equine diseases.",

Ligands bind to heterodimers of TLR2 with either TLR1 or TLR6 [16, 39]. The TLR1/2 heterodimer recognises triacylated lipopeptides, whereas the TLR2/6 complex recognises diacylated lipopeptides [13]. Toll\u2010like receptor 2 knockout mice are hypersusceptible to Gram\u2010positive bacterial infections, including sepsis and meningitis [40], and people with mutations in the TLR2 gene have an increased susceptibility to infection with Gram\u2010positive organisms [41]. TLR2 mRNA is present in the normal lung of horses and is increased after LPS challenge [38, 42]. Currently, there is no evidence for TLR2 playing a role in equine sepsis, although if Gram\u2010positive organisms are isolated from a clinical case, it is highly likely that this PRR will be at least partly responsible for driving any inflammatory response.",

Flagella are important for bacterial motility and for cellular invasion [44]. A wide variety of flagellated bacteria, such as E. coli and Salmonella spp., cause disease in the horse [45]. An evolutionarily conserved region of flagellin, D1, interacts with the leucine\u2010rich repeats of TLR5 on the cell surface of diverse cell types, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and epithelial cells [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Human peripheral blood monocytes express moderate amounts of TLR5, and activation by flagellin results in a strong expression of proinflammatory cytokines [50, 53]. In mice, TLR5 mRNA expression is found in dendritic cells, but is not detected in neutrophils [49]. In the horse, both monocytes and neutrophils express TLR5 mRNA, but show differential expression of TLR5 proteins on the cell surface [52]. Toll\u2010like receptor 5 agonists activate equine neutrophils, but not monocytes, alveolar macrophages or peritoneal macrophages despite the fact that these cell types contain TLR5 mRNA transcripts. Cytokine gene expression induced by flagellin in neutrophils was comparable with that stimulated by LPS or Pam3CSK4 (a synthetic TLR2 agonist) [52]. What role, if any, TLR5 may play in infectious diseases in the horse is unclear, but it may be important in shock, sepsis, acute respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal infection [54].",

The Cytosine\u2010phosphate\u2010Guanine (CpG) DNA activates dendritic cells and is important in initiating adaptive immune responses [56]. Toll\u2010like receptor 9 forms homodimers before ligand binding [57], then undergoes multiple cleavage steps on or after ligand binding prior to signalling [58, 59]. The precise order and timing of dimerisation and cleavage/activation remain to be established. Toll\u2010like receptor 9 shows differential expression among normal and inflamed tissues [60, 61, 62, 63]. Equine TLR9 is found in lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, bronchial epithelial cells, type II cells in the equine lung [64, 65], and the cornea, limbus and the conjunctiva of the equine eye [66]. Age has little influence on TLR9 expression in neutrophils [67], macrophages or dentritic cells [68]. The role of TLR9 in equine disease remains to be elucidated.",

There are 2 distinct families of NLRs; the NLRP proteins contain a pyrin domain, and the NLRC proteins, such as NOD1, NOD2, NLRC3 and NLRC4 contain a caspase recruitment domain [70]. NLRP3, NLRP1 and NLRC4 form protein complexes called inflammasomes such that upon ligand binding a change in NLR confirmation leads to recruitment of an adaptor molecule (apoptosis\u2010related speck\u2010like protein [ASC]) and an effector molecule (pro\u2010caspase\u20101) in an oligomeric complex. This complex activates a proteolytic cascade resulting in the maturation and release of, amongst others, proinflammatory cytokines of the interleukin\u20101 family [71].

GM\u2010dipeptide is found in all bacteria, hence NOD2 can be regarded as a general sensor of peptidoglycan degradation products [72].

Development of TLR4 antagonists is challenging because many of the drugs developed are derived from bacterial lipid As that are antagonists in humans and mice, but this does not mean they will necessarily be antagonists in the horse. Lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, for example, is a TLR4 antagonist in humans and mice, but it is an agonist in the horse and hamster [96, 97]. E5531, a synthetic compound based on the lipid A structure of Rhodobacter capsulatus, is an antagonist in mice and humans, an antagonist in equine cell models, but an agonist in an equine whole\u2010blood model [98, 99, 100]. A second\u2010generation compound based on E5531, eritoran (E5564), is a potent antagonist of LPS in humans [101, 102] and in horses [103], but in phase III clinical trials [104] it did not meet its primary end\u2010point in humans with severe sepsis [105].

However, PRR antagonists will need careful clinical evaluation because of the controversial results emerging from human clinical trials due to the complex, multifactorial pathogenesis of these diseases. Use of TLR4 antagonists in endotoxic horses is likely to be successful, but whether PRR antagonists will be useful in septic foals is less clear. Infections with mixed bacterial species will potentially involve multiple PRRs, suggesting that combination therapy simultaneously inhibiting several PRRs may be necessary. Complete inhibition of PRRs is potentially detrimental, particularly in sepsis, because TLR4 and TLR2 knockout mice show increased mortality in response to Gram\u2010negative or Gram\u2010positive bacteria, respectively. Specific equine drugs will need to be developed to achieve a safe treatment that blocks systemic inflammation whilst retaining the protective immune responses against bacterial infection.",
