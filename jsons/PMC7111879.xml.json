Such disagreement could be due to the presence of PCR inhibitors and DNA damaging substances in stool samples, but can also result from poor-quality specimens, e.g. extremely autolysed tissues or those stored at room temperature for prolonged periods. In addition, false-positive reactions in the ELISA assay may be due to the non-specific binding of antibodies used as reagents to intestinal bacteria or their products (Brandt et al., 1981). However, this was probably not the case since the results did not change, even after incubation of ELISA pos/RT-PCR neg samples with a negative mouse serum in order to block a potential binding between murine antibody (MAbs) and pig specimens.",

The rapid decrease of the frequency of detection is probably also related to the quick development of a sufficient level of immunity in the population that caused a reduction of virus circulation. These findings are similar to those found in other countries with developed swine production (Pensaert and Sang-Geon, 2006).",
