Other related members are mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus HKU1, etc. [1]. PHEV causes vomiting and wasting disease, as well as encephalomyelitis in piglets younger than 3 weeks, particularly in those lacking PHEV antibodies such as SPF pigs [2]. Recently, more research has focused on PHEV because infection rates have risen in some countries [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. PHEV is a highly neurovirulent virus that spreads to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves, where nerve cells are a target for viral replication [7], and this spread could result in high neuropathogenicity. However, the mechanism by which PHEV enters the nerve cells remains largely unknown.",

The receptor of the coronaviral S protein is responsible for viruses entering into cells via fusion of viral envelope and the cellular membrane [11]. For example, the entry of SARS-CoV into cells is initiated by the binding of the S protein to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [12], and the S protein of MERS-CoV targets the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [13]. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM, also known as CD56) is a homophilic glycoprotein expressed on the surface of nerve cells. NCAM has been implicated as having a role in cell-cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity [14]. In 2010, Gao et al. [15] confirmed that NCAM participates in the process by which PHEV infects neurons. Therefore, NCAM may be a receptor for PHEV in N2a cells.",

To identify the crucial domain of the S1 subunit that interacts with NCAM, three truncated fusion proteins spanning the entire S1 subunit were prepared. These recombinant proteins were screened using a GST pull-down experiment, and the interactions were further confirmed by a yeast two-hybrid system assay. The results showed that the S277-794 fragment could interact with NCAM, and a smaller fragment (258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548) located in S277-794 may be the RBD of the PHEV S protein. These results will be the foundation for researching the mechanism of PHEV infection. In addition, recombinant proteins derived from the RBD could serve as targets for antiviral chemotherapy or a vaccine.",

It is widely recognized that the main determinant of coronavirus tropism is the viral S protein which mediates binding to a cell surface receptor [22]. The S proteins of coronaviruses have an S1 and an S2 subunit. The S1 subunit initiates entry of viruses into cells by binding to cell surface receptors, and the S2 subunit helps viral fusion with cellular membranes [23, 24, 25]. The RBDs present in the S1 subunit is important for interaction with receptors. Wong et al. [16] reported that a 193-amino-acid fragment of the SARS-CoV S protein (residues 318-510) has been shown to interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and recently, Mou et al. [22] found that a 231-amino-acid fragment of the MERS-CoV S protein (residues 358-588) could interact with the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4. Therefore, the S1 subunits of S proteins are crucial for the interactions of coronaviruses with specific receptors.",

In addition, because S1-291 and S548-868 could not interact with NCAM, and there are overlapping regions between S277-794 and S1-291 as well as S277-794 and S548-868, we conclude that the S1 subunit may contain a cellular receptor-binding region up to 258 amino acids long. These findings suggested that the 258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548, may be the NCAM RBD of the S protein. This region may mediate PHEV binding to NCAM, but further studies are needed to confirm these results. Meanwhile, S1-291 and S548-868 did not interact with NCAM and might be less relevant to bind the cellular receptor.",
