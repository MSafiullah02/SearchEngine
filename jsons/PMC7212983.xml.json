The patient\u2019s past medical history was significant for COPD (FEV1% predicted 63%, DLCO% predicted 42%). She had a history of being a former smoker, with a 70-pack year history. Based on the nodule\u2019s growth on surveillance lung CT, and FDG-avidity on PET/CT (30.3) a clinical diagnosis of NSCLC was made. After the patient was deemed to be a high-risk operable candidate, she was recommended for SBRT was recommended for definitive management. She underwent CT simulation in mid-March for SBRT (55Gy/5 daily consecutive fractions), and her first treatment was delivered 10 calendar days later. However, at the time of her on treatment visit the patient reported increased severity of her baseline cough and shortness of breath, several episodes of post-tussive emesis and increased fatigue not relieved by rest. On review of her CBCT imaging, it was found that she had new GGOs in the right lower lobe (Figure 2\n). Based on these symptoms and findings, the institution\u2019s COVID hotline was immediately notified on 4/1/2020. However, because the patient did not meet the criteria at that time for COVID-19 screening (lack of fevers, sick contacts, or travel), she was not recommended for testing. Given the continued clinical concern for both her symptoms and new findings on CBCT, a direct communication was made with an infectious disease physician at the institution, who recommended she be treated as a presumed COVID-19 positive patient and she was approved for testing. She was given a mask and instructed to start home quarantine. Three days later her test returned as negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, given the continued high index of suspicion for COVID-19, the patient remains in quarantine, with a plan to complete her final two fractions of SBRT once she has been asymptomatic for 3 days. The new imaging findings are still attributed to her potential COVID-19 diagnosis, in the absence of any confirmed alternative.",

The patient\u2019s past medical history includes emphysema, obstructive sleep apnea, and non-specific pulmonary nodules that had been followed on chest CT, ultimately leading to the current diagnosis. The patient was a former smoker who quit over a decade ago but had a 74-pack-year smoking history. The patient was treated with curative intent twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy concurrent with carboplatin and etoposide. All institutional radiation dose-volume parameters were within tolerance, the mean lung radiation dose was 9.3Gy, and the volume of lung receiving \u2265 20Gy was 19.8%. Chemoradiation was well tolerated with acute toxicities including grade 1 cough and grade 1 esophagitis. Approximately 9 weeks after radiotherapy, the patient called reporting a two-day history of a new non-productive cough with increased dyspnea and increased use of albuterol. The patient denied fever, fatigue, or a decreased appetite. The patient asked if her current symptoms could be toxicities from her radiation treatment. At the time of her call, there was an intensification of the local COVID-19 epidemic. The patient was counseled on radiation pneumonitis (RP) and the potential need to start treatment with a high-dose corticosteroid taper. No repeat imaging was obtained at the time. However, out of caution she was recommended to undergo testing for COVID-19. The COVID-19 qualitative RNA test returned positive. The patient was not treated for RP, but rather, referred for COVID-19 management.",

Recommendations from RO-ILS included having radiation therapists, physicists, dosimetrists, and physicians become familiar with and screen for these characteristic COVID-19 findings daily and triage patients with findings for further evaluation.

Additionally, patients that have a history of systemic therapy, particularly immunotherapy, may also have pulmonary parenchymal changes over time (24). However, as shown in the cases presented here, the rapidity of infiltrate appearance on treatment should prompt immediate attention by the treating physician for symptom screening, vital signs, and appropriate triage to institutional COVID testing. Conversely, negative CBCTs should not be used to clinically \u2018clear\u2019 patients that are having other COVID associated symptoms, such as fever, new or worsening cough, new or worsening shortness of breath, and pleuritis. In a retrospective series of more than 120 COVID-19 positive patients across 4 medical centers in China, diagnostic CT images were compared by duration of time between symptom presentation and imaging (25). For patients receiving CT imaging 0 \u2013 2 days from initiation of symptoms, 56% of these \u201cearly scans\u201d were negative, while only 10% of intermediate scans at 3-5 days from symptoms and 4% of late scans at 6-12 days from symptoms were negative.

The characteristics symptoms of RP include progressive shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, with or without a low-grade fever occurring weeks to several months after thoracic radiation. These symptoms overlap with those of COVID-19. Given the increasing prevalence of COVID-19, patients who present for RP evaluation should be tested for COVID-19, especially if they are to be started on empiric high-dose corticosteroids. Data indicate that corticosteroid therapy can worsen COVID-19-associated lung injury (26).

For those who test positive, robust data are lacking regarding the appropriate timeframe for radiotherapy resumption. The CDC has provided guidelines on non-testing strategy criteria for ending transmission-based precautions in the healthcare setting (28, 29), which may be adopted for these scenarios pending stronger evidence. A test-based strategy is also outlined requiring two consecutive negative test results (collected at least 24 hours apart), although implementation may be limited due to lack of test availability and capacity. Per non-testing strategy for symptomatic patients (Case 2), CDC requirements entail the passage of: (a) \u22657 days since first appearance of symptoms; and (b) \u22653 days since recovery (defined as resolution of fever and improvement of respiratory symptoms). However, these guidelines are admittedly specific to isolation. Thus, more stringent criteria and timeframes may be warranted for active cancer patients. As for asymptomatic patients (Case 1), our institution requires \u226514-days to pass from first positive COVID-19 result (typically without need for re-testing), although this 14-day timeline was cautiously re-applied towards the patient\u2019s second positive test date (ordered through her local provider).",

While measures such as screening questions and temperature measurements prior to department check-in certainly play a crucial role in appropriate patient triage, we are in a unique position to use an additional resource to monitor our high-risk patients with on-treatment daily CT imaging. Although this manuscript described three scenarios for patients with thoracic malignancies, we would recommend that both the initial simulation CT and on-board CTs acquired as part of daily image-guidance of any patient where the imaging field of view encompasses the chest be reviewed for new or increasing infiltrates, particularly in patients with new symptoms. The entire image set should be reviewed, superiorly-to-inferiorly, to assess for potential changes. Due to the observations that radiologic changes may precede physical symptoms, and considering a false negative rate ranging from 10% to 30% (9), this routine part of our daily cancer care gives us an additional tool to monitor our patients during this unprecedented time.",
