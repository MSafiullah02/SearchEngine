            "text": "Enteroviruses (EVs) are common pathogens that are associated with various clinical syndromes involving different organ systems. Historically, EVs were classified according to clinical, serological, and culture characteristics, but currently, sequence divergence in the VP1 capsid-coding region is used for allocation of these viruses into different genotypes. Together with the closely related rhinoviruses, EV species belong to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae (1). To date, 8 EV species are recognized, A to H, of which species A to D are known to cause disease in humans. Strains that have less than 75% nucleotide and 85% amino acid similarity in the VP1 region are classified as different genotypes (2, 3). Newly identified EV strains are regularly reported (4). Infections caused by EVs include hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), myocarditis, respiratory infections, meningitis, and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (1). Although some clinical conditions are classically associated with one or more EV genotypes, such as AFP, which before mass vaccination used to be most commonly caused by polioviruses, it is apparent that each EV type is capable of causing a variety of clinical syndromes and that a particular clinical syndrome may be caused by a variety of EV types. Correspondingly, EV-A71, which causes HFMD, is also capable of causing neurological infections (5). Additionally, neurological infections as well as HFMD can be caused by a variety of EV genotypes (6, 7). Most EV infections are nevertheless subclinical, and their circulation in the population goes unnoticed. International surveillance of EVs is limited but exists for poliovirus. In addition, many countries have a surveillance system at the national level for cases of AFP and neurological infections caused by EVs other than poliovirus (8, 9). Data about circulating EV genotypes are thereby generated, but these data are not comprehensive. EVs, beyond poliovirus, continue to be important pathogens. Indeed, during the summer of 2014, an unprecedented outbreak of EV-D68 occurred, affecting thousands of people in North America as well as in Europe (10, 11). This outbreak highlights first that EV outbreaks are unlikely to remain confined to a single geographical area and second that EVs may be the cause of severe respiratory illness.",

EV-C104 was first found in Switzerland in 2005 in respiratory samples from patients with respiratory illnesses. Since then, EV-C104 was found sporadically in Italy, Japan, and Gambia (12\u201315). EV-C105 was first identified in the fecal sample of a Congolese man with AFP; however, this virus was subsequently detected in respiratory samples in Italy, Peru, Cyprus, New Zealand (16\u201319), and most recently in another case of AFP in the United States (20). EV-C109 was first identified in respiratory samples in Nicaragua (21). Since its first description, it has been detected in respiratory samples in Italy and Hungary and in a fecal sample in Congo (22\u201324). EV-C117 was first found in a Lithuanian child with pneumonia (25). However, in total so far, about 25 reported cases of EV-C104 have been described over a period of 10 years, and for the other \u201cnew\u201d EV-C species viruses, this number is even lower.

Forty different EV genotypes were detected in our clinical virology laboratory. During the study period, EV diversity was dominated by two upsurges of EV-D68 in respiratory samples, one in 2010 and one in 2014, which together with nine sporadic cases in the remaining study years account for 16% of the typeable isolates. Interestingly, only three fecal samples during the study period had detectable EV-D68. All three patients also had respiratory illness, most likely caused by this virus. While in this study most EVs detected in fecal samples represented background circulation, it is interesting that this virus was not detected as an incidental finding in patients presenting with other symptoms. Previous studies that have investiged EV-D68 report that the detection of EV-D68 appears to be restricted to respiratory materials (30). However, no EV genotype prevalence studies exist that include years with EV-D68 outbreaks. Considering the very low overall prevalence of EVs in respiratory materials (0.7%), EVs did not appear to be important respiratory pathogens outside of the two EV-D68 outbreak years. Moreover, all EVs probably replicate to some extent in the nasopharyngeal epithelium and may be detectable in respiratory samples (1). Nevertheless, the genotypes that we detected in respiratory materials were significant. While 41 respiratory materials were positive for EVs other than EV-D68, 12 (29%) of these were EV-C genotypes. Twenty-three species C EVs were detected, which is remarkable because similar studies to ours in the past have found very few, if any, EVs belonging to the EV-C group (31, 32). Many of these studies, however, did not include respiratory materials, which is where most species C EVs were found in this study. The classical CV-A21 was detected in respiratory secretions of three patients who all presented with severe respiratory illness in the fall of 2013. One instance of CV-A21 was detected in the feces of a patient with diarrhea, probably an incidental finding. CV-A21 is currently a well-recognized cause of respiratory problems (33). The sequence analyses of the CV-A21 isolates in this study show that they are closely related and that they are very similar to CV-A21 circulating in North America (3).",

To date, very few viruses of these genotypes have been reported worldwide. Of EV-C104, EV-C105, EV-C109, and EV-C117, the total number of isolates described worldwide is less than 10 each (19\u201325). Especially for EV-C109, which appears to be extremely rare, it is remarkable that six patients with this virus were found in a relatively small study. It is possible that EV-C109 was only recently introduced in Europe or that we experienced a small upsurge of an otherwise low pathogenic virus, which was only found because of the vulnerable patient population in our hospital. Yet, two other reasons have to be considered.",
