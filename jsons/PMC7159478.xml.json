Generally, an asthma exacerbation is considered to be an increase in a patient's asthma symptoms with increasingly impaired lung function that require increased medication, an unscheduled visit to a physician or hospitalization. A single asthma exacerbation requiring extra medication and possibly emergency treatment and hospitalization can increase the annual treatment costs by more than threefold 3. Recurrent asthma exacerbations lead to a progressive decline in lung function 4, and the risk of an exacerbation doubles in children who have had one or more in the previous year 5. A rare but distinct phenotype of asthma exacerbation is characterized by the development of sudden severe asthma symptoms in an otherwise mild or asymptomatic asthmatic subject, which may be triggered by an allergen, drug (e.g. aspirin), food, air pollutant, occupational agent, virus infection or, in many cases, an unknown (or unidentified) trigger 6. It has been proposed that within the group of patients with recurrent exacerbations, detailed phenotyping in terms of clinical symptoms, lung function, inflammatory and other biomarkers is warranted 7, 8. There is a significant unmet need for identifying and characterizing the factors that increase the risk of asthma exacerbations and the therapeutic and preventive options that reduce these risks.",

They have diverse clinical profiles, which probably reflect diverse disease mechanisms, and, for many of them, standard treatment is not sufficiently effective 9, 10, 11. Severe asthma comprises a highly heterogeneous group of patients, which is defined in various ways in the published literature and in the national and international guidelines. A consensus is emerging that patients should be considered to have a \u2018difficult\u2010to\u2010control asthma\u2019 if they have persistent symptoms and recurrent exacerbations despite being prescribed therapy at the highest steps of the guidelines' pharmacological management 12. However, it is worth emphasizing that the guidelines also make clear that \u2018difficult\u2010to\u2010control asthma\u2019 is multifactorial, and issues such as incorrect diagnosis, comorbid conditions, nonadherence to prescribed medication, psychosocial morbidity and a number of other factors discussed later in this manuscript are major causes of \u2018difficult\u2019 asthma 12. Patients should be considered to have severe asthma that is resistant to currently available therapies only following a detailed analysis and appropriate management of all these background problems that are amenable to intervention. A recently published consensus statement on severe asthma broadened the concept of \u2018difficult asthma\u2019 to reflect the situation in less developed countries, where access to medications and appropriate care is a major issue, by defining three different patient groups including un(der)treated symptomatic patients, patients with low treatment adherence or unconventional therapies, and those remaining symptomatic despite high doses of anti\u2010asthmatic therapies 13, 14.",

Appropriate assessment of adherence 18 and other potentially modifiable factors (such as passive or active smoking, ongoing allergen exposure, psychosocial factors, etc.) 19 has to be a priority in clinical assessment of all patients with difficult\u2010to\u2010control asthma, before any decision about increasing the treatment is made (including possible prescription of an expensive biological therapy) 17.",

Recent joint modelling of longitudinal observations on wheezing from parental reports and medical records identified a novel phenotype of persistent troublesome wheeze with high rates of severe asthma exacerbations and healthcare utilization 24. Despite having phenotypic markers commonly considered to be indicators of good therapeutic response (atopy and eczema), these children had relatively poor response to currently available anti\u2010inflammatory treatments 24.",

Psychological dysfunction 28 and treatment nonadherence are separate psychosocial factors that may significantly contribute to the risk of asthma exacerbations. A significant number of patients with high rates of asthma exacerbations, and increased airway eosinophilia, were found to have a low perception of their lung dysfunction 29.

However, there is a strong rationale for using direct measurement of airway inflammation as an additional means to guide treatment in severe asthma. Green et al. 30 reported that titrating treatment to sputum eosinophil counts was more successful in reducing asthma exacerbations than treatment in accordance with guidelines. This was confirmed in a larger, multicentre study 31, which also reported that the frequency and severity of eosinophilic exacerbations were reduced without increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (the severity but not the frequency of noneosinophilic exacerbations was also reduced). The treatment strategy of these authors was to (i) treat patients with sputum eosinophil counts of >2% with the minimal ICS dose required to reduce sputum eosinophil counts to normal and (ii) consider other treatment options in patients with normal sputum eosinophil counts, such as treatment of airway obstruction with long\u2010acting beta\u2010agonists (LABAs) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist, or treatment of neutrophilic inflammation with antibiotics. Of interest, a treatment approach aimed at specifically reducing airway eosinophils using a monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin (IL)\u20105 reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations in patients with severe asthma and persisting airway eosinophilia 32, 33. However, it is of note that even after using this targeted approach, approximately 50% of severe exacerbations remained unaffected by the treatment.",

Those patients with a baseline FEV1 < 76% of predicted plus an FENO >28 ppb had a probability of an asthma exacerbation in 18 months of 85%, while those with FEV1  > 76% of predicted plus a FENO <28 ppb had zero probability of an asthma exacerbation in the same period.

Such impairments in airway immunity correlate with the in vivo severity of the infections and with the viral load 45, 46. Consequently, specific and nonspecific antiviral strategies may have great potential as therapeutic and preventative strategies for asthma exacerbations, a hypothesis that is supported by preliminary clinical studies 37. Patients with asthma also have deficient interleukin\u201012 and type III interferon responses to bacterial stimuli, suggesting that inadequate host defence mechanisms and mechanisms specific to the infectious agents are the underlying factors for increased susceptibility 45, 46. Rhinovirus and enterovirus infections are more likely to cause an asthma exacerbation than most other viruses in patients of any age, with the exception of RSV in infants 39, while virus load and virus co\u2010infection rates correlate with symptom severity 47.",
