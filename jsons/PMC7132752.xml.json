Mathematical analysis and modeling operation of infectious diseases are critical to study virus spreading dynamics which can state clearly the origination and evolution of viruses. In recent years, many mathematical models have been proposed for the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] such as, SI (susceptible\u2013infective), SIR (susceptible\u2013infective\u2013removed), SEIR (susceptible\u2013exposure\u2013infective\u2013recovered), SEI (susceptible\u2013exposure\u2013infective), SIRS (susceptible\u2013infective\u2013removed\u2013susceptible), SEIS (susceptible\u2013exposure\u2013infective\u2013susceptible). The development of such models is aimed at exploring the transmission dynamics of epidemic virus, investigating the evolution of resistance to antibiotics and the evolutionary cost of resistance, and designing the programs for disease control. However, a model\u2019s ability to achieve the above goals depends greatly on whether the assumptions made in the modeling process are consistent with the actual evolution of the epidemic diseases. Understanding and predicting the actual transmission dynamics of the epidemic diseases is, therefore, an important pursuit in mathematical epidemiology, which is one of our motivations for this work.",

The underlying reason behind such attention is that through stability analysis for the epidemic models, the tendency of the infectious diseases can be found by the basic reproductive number R0 (the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case in an entirely susceptible population) and the generation time (the average time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary case), which determine to a large extent the speed of epidemic outbreaks. Based on the stability principles, the conditions of the infectious diseases persistence or extinction were obtained [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].",

            "text": "Huang [3] presented an SEIR model, which is suitable for the eradication of diseases by mass vaccination or the control of diseases by case isolation combined with contact tracing, incorporating the vaccine efficacy or the control efficacy into the model. An SIRC model with a fourth class, i.e., the cross-immune individuals, was proposed [9]. Via bifurcation analysis of the model, they discussed the effect of seasonality on the epidemiological regimes. In this model, the incubation period of virus is not considered, nevertheless, a majority of infectious diseases have incubation period. Buonomo et al. [16] studied the global behavior of a non-linear SIR epidemic model with a non-bilinear feedback mechanism, which describes the influences of information and information-related delays on a vaccination campaign. Wan and Cui [17] proposed an SEIS epidemic model to study the effect of transport-related infection on the spread and control of infectious disease. Furthermore, through stability analysis, they found that it is very essential to strengthen restrictions of passengers once infectious diseases appearance is known. In [18], McCluskey studied the complete global stability for the SIR models with distributed delay and with discrete delay. Lahrouz et al. [19] analyzed the complete global stability for an SIRS epidemic model with generalized non-linear incidence and vaccination. In [20], Kuniya studied the global asymptotic stability for an age-structured multigroup SIR epidemic model with a discretization approach. Muroya et al. [21] investigated the global asymptotic stability of a disease transmission model of SIRS type with latent period and the specific non-monotone incidence rate. The results of these studies, however, do not take into account the whole process of the epidemic diseases such as the exposed fraction and the partial immunity individuals, which are to a great extent owing to deficiency of the genetic variation behavior of the virus and the epidemiology theory. Consequently, they are limited on reflecting the actual transmission dynamics of the epidemic diseases and offering the practical proposal for government to draw up the policy.",

Our model differs from the existing ones in [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] in the following respect: (i) our model additionally takes into account the exposed fraction and the partial immunity individuals; (ii) our model is coupled with evolutionary\u2013epidemic strategy and human interference behaviors such as vaccination to a proportion of all newborn children; (iii) in particular, the force of infection of the infectious disease in the existing work is multiplied by a constant such as survival probability while in this paper, it is governed by a nonlinear time-varying growing curve of pathogens, which reflects the viruses\u2019 evolution. Subsequently, we transform the SEIRW model into the ordinary differential equation with time-varying perturbation. Then we carry out a complete stability analysis of the transformed SEIRW model and establish its stability criteria. Furthermore, we introduce the time-varying delay into the susceptible and infective stages of the SEIRW model and provide the globally exponential stability criteria for the SEIRW model with the time-varying delay. Finally, the numerical simulations verify the results. One of our purposes for this work is to investigate the effect of the treatment on the long term dynamics of the disease, and show that the treatment or rational immunization to prolong the susceptible or infective stages can hasten the disease dying out. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that builds a novel SEIRW model by considering pathogen evolution and human interference behaviors, and further establishes sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the model with time-varying perturbation and the global exponential stability of the model with time-varying delay.",

(1a) is a classical equation which is widely used in life science to describe the growth of the organism such as leaves, bacterium. The parameters a, b and k have specific biological meanings and are only positive real numbers in (1a). The unit of time t is day. Here, the derivation of Eq. (1a) is given by.(1b)g(t)=abke-at(1+be-at)2,a,b,k>0,which denotes the infectious rate function of viruses and the speed of the viruses growth. Since the transmission of the viruses among the populations is related with the infectious rate of the viruses; furthermore, it is direct proportion to the infectious rate, therefore, in this paper, the speed of the viruses\u2019 transmission among the populations is expressed by the function \u03c9(t) below.(1c)\u03c9(t)=k1g(t)=k1kabe-at(1+be-at)2,a,b,k>0,In (1c), the product of k\n1\nk is constant and it can be represented by k just as well. Consequently, the infectious rate of transmission among the populations can be given by (2).(2)\u03c9(t)=abke-at(1+be-at)2,is constant and it can be representeda,b,k>0.\n",

From an epidemiological point of view, the normal community of people can be divided into five compartments at any time t for the majority infectious diseases such as influenza A, SARS and AIDS: the susceptible individuals S(t), who may be infected by the viruses, and do not have specific immune defenses against the infectious disease; the exposed fraction E(t), which denotes hosts whom viruses have entered into while the viruses are in incubation period; the infective individuals I(t), who are infected by the specific viruses and are infectious to the susceptible individuals; the recovered fraction R(t), which denotes those individuals who have recovered from the infection but have partially immune to the specific pathogen. However, after a period of time, a part of the individuals in R(t) enter the next group W(t), the partial immunity individuals, because they have only partial immunity to the viruses owing to their variation in the new environment [26], [30], as in the case of SRAS [26], influenza [31] and pertussis [32]. The environment is much important for the survival of intermediate hosts and for the survival of the pathogens outside the host, which can affect the efficiency of transmission. The environmental component of infectiousness can result in an unusually large number of secondary infections, which motivates that the environmental effect should be considered in our model. For example, the \u2018superspreading\u2019 event led to various secondary severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections among residents of the Amoy Gardens estate in Hong Kong in 2003 [26].",

(8) have negative real parts, and unstable if one root has positive real part. The characteristic equation of system (7) can be given by-a1-\u03bb000\u03b20-a2-\u03bb00d\u03b30\u03b5-a3-\u03bb0000\u03b1-a4-\u03bbd(1-\u03b3)000\u03be-a5-\u03bb=0.It can be rewritten in the form of polynomial as(8)(\u03bb+a1)(\u03bb4+b1\u03bb3+b2\u03bb2+b3\u03bb+b4)=0.whereb1=a2+a3+a4+a5,b2=(a2+a3)(a4+a5)+a2a3+a4a5-\u03bed(1-\u03b3),b3=a4a5(a2+a3)+a2a3(a4+a5)-\u03bed(1-\u03b3)(a2+a3),b4=a2a3a4a5-a2a3\u03bed(1-\u03b3)-\u03b5d\u03b3\u03b1\u03be.In order to study the stability of the equilibrium of system (7), we need to investigate the distribution of roots of Eq. (8). For the first term in the left-hand side of (8), we have \u03bb\n = \u2212a\n1\n < 0. It is clear that the equilibrium point of system (7) is asymptotically stable. Therefore, we only need to consider the following characteristic equation:(9)\u03bb4(b1\u03bb3+b2\u03bb2+b3\u03bb+b4)=0.Since a\n4\na\n5\n =  (\u03bc\n + \n\u03be)(d\n + \n\u03bc\n + \n\u03b2) = \n\u03bc(d\n + \n\u03bc\n + \n\u03b2) + \n\u03bed\n + \n\u03be (\u03bc\n + \n\u03b2) > \n\u03bed\n > \n\u03bed(1 \u2212 \n\u03b3), it is clear that b\n1\n > 0, b\n2\n > 0 and b\n3\n > 0.Furthermore, we have b\n4\n > 0, which is due toa2a3a4a5=a2a3\u03bc(d+\u03bc+\u03b2)+a2a3\u03be(\u03bc+\u03b2)+a2a3\u03bed=a2a3\u03bc(d+\u03bc+\u03b2)+a2a3\u03be(\u03bc+\u03b2)+a2a3\u03bed(1-\u03b3)+a2a3\u03bed\u03b3=a2a3\u03bc(d+\u03bc+\u03b2)+a2a3\u03be(\u03bc+\u03b2)+a2a3\u03bed(1-\u03b3)+\u03b3\u03bed(\u03bc+\u03b5)(\u03bc+\u03b7+\u03b1)>a2a3\u03bed(1-\u03b3)-\u03b5\u03b1\u03bed\u03b3.According to Routh\u2013Hurwitz criterion, all roots of the characteristic Eq. (8) will have negative real parts provided that the following conditions are satisfied:(9a)\u25b51=b1b2-b3>0and(9b)\u25b52=b3(b1b2-b3)-b4b12>0.In the following, we will prove the conditions (9a), (9b) hold.It follows from (8) thatb1b2-b3=(a2+a3+a4+a5)[(a2+a3)(a4+a5)+a2a3+a4a5-\u03bed(1-\u03b3)]-[a4a5(a2+a3)+a2a3(a4+a5)-\u03bed(1-\u03b3)(a2+a3)]=(a2+a3+a4+a5)(a2+a3)(a4+a5)+a2a3(a2+a3)+a4a5(a4+a5)-\u03bed(1-\u03b3)(a4+a5)=(a2+a3+a4+a5)(a2+a3)(a4+a5)+a2a3(a2+a3)+(a4a5-d\u03be+d\u03be\u03b3)(a4+a5)Since a\n4\na\n5\n \u2212 \nd\u03be\n + \nd\u03be\u03b3\n = \n\u03bc(d\n + \n\u03bc\n + \n\u03b2) + \n\u03be(d\u03b3\n + \n\u03bc\n + \n\u03b2) > 0, we can get b\n1\nb\n2\n \u2212 \nb\n3\n > 0. Therefore, the first condition (9a) is satisfied.b3(b1b2-b3)-b4b12\u2a7eb1(a2+a3)2(a4+a5)(\u03bcd+\u03bed+a4(\u03bc+\u03b2))-b1(a2+a3)2(a4+a5)\u03bed(1-\u03b3)+b1a2a3(a2+a3)(a4+a5)2+2\u03bed(1-\u03b3)(a2+a3)(a4+a5)(a2a3-a4a5)+[\u03bed(1-\u03b3)]2(a2+a3)(a4+a5)+\u03b5d\u03b3\u03b1\u03beb12>b1(a2+a3)2(a4+a5)(\u03bcd+a4(\u03bc+\u03b2))+b1a2a3(a2+a3)(a4+a5)2+2\u03bed(1-\u03b3)(a2+a3)(a4+a5)(a2a3-a4a5)+[\u03bed(1-\u03b3)]2(a2+a3)(a4+a5)+\u03b5d\u03b3\u03b1\u03beb12>0It is clear that the condition (9b) holds, i.e., \u25b52\n > 0. This completes the proof. \u25a1\nRemark 1We can conclude from Theorem 1 that the value of \u03b3 does not effect on the stability of system (7). In other words, the stability of system (7) is unrelated to the proportion of the partial immunity individuals to the exposed ones, or to the recovered ones. The stability criterion of system (7) is much relaxed.\n",

Calculating derivative of this function along the trajectories of system (4) yields(14)V\u02d9(t,x)=\u2202V\u2202t+\u2202V\u2202xx\u02d9=\u2202V\u2202t+\u2202V\u2202xAx+\u2202V\u2202xG(t,x).The first two terms of the right side of (14) constitute the derivation of V(t, \nx) along the trajectories of the linear part of system (4), and the third term is the result of perturbation.Taking the derivative of (12) along the linear part of system (4), we haveV\u02d9(t,x)=xT(AP+PA)x.By comparison with the first two terms of the right side of (14), it is easy to obtain that\u2202V\u2202t=0,\u2202V\u2202xAx=xT(ATP+PA)x.We know from Theorem 1 that the matrix A is Hurwitz matrix and the linear system (7) is asymptotically stable. Thus A\nT\nP\n + \nPA is positive definite. Without loss of generality, we let A\nT\nP\n + \nPA\n = \u2212Q, where Q is a symmetrical positive definite matrix. Then we can get(15)\u2202V\u2202xAx=-xTQx\u2a7d-\u03bbmin(Q)\u2016x\u20162.Moreover, the following relationship can be obtained:(16)\u2202V\u2202x=\u20162xTP\u2016\u2a7d2\u2016P\u2016\u2016x\u2016=2\u03bbmax(P)\u2016x\u2016.According to Lemma 1 and the relationships (15), (16), it follows thatV\u02d9(t,x)=\u2202V\u2202t+\u2202V\u2202xAx+\u2202V\u2202xG(t,x)0\u2a7d-\u03bbmin(Q)\u2016x\u20162+\u2202V\u2202x\u2016G(t,x)\u2016\u2a7d-\u03bbmin(Q)\u2016x\u20162+2\u03b4\u03bbmax(P)\u2016x\u20162=(-\u03bbmin(Q)+2\u03b4\u03bbmax(P))\u2016x\u20162.Thus, if \u03b4<\u03bbmin(Q)/(2\u03bbmax(P)),V\u02d9(t,x)<0, i.e., the system (4) is asymptotically stable.Obviously, the bound of \u03b4 depends on the choose of Q. Therefore, it is a challenge that how to chose Q makes \u03bb\nmin(Q)/\u03bb\nmax(P) maximum. It has been proven in [34] that when Q\n = \nI, i.e., A\nT\nP\n + \nPA\n = \u2212I, the goal can be reached.From Lemma 1, we have that if \u03d5\n2\n + \n\u03c6\n2\n < 1/(2\u03bb\nmax (P))2, the system (4) is asymptotically stable. This completes the proof. \u25a1\nRemark 2It can be concluded from Theorem 2 that the system (4) is asymptotically stable if the condition is satisfied: \u03d5\n2\n + \n\u03c6\n2\n < 1/(2\u03bb\nmax(P))2. The condition implies that if the quadratic sum of the inflow of susceptible individuals and the inflow of vaccinated individuals to the vaccinated compartment, is below a constant value, the disease will tend to be stable, that is to say, the infectious disease will not be diffuse infinitely but will become endemic disease. This means that we can control the value of Bv, the ratio of vaccination to newborn children, to postpone the outbreak of the disease and the epidemic disease becomes disappeared gradually.\n",

Hence, \u2223x\ni(t)\u2223 \u2a7d \nw, for all t\n \u2a7e  0. Therefore, the solution x(t) = [x\n1(t), \u2026 , \nx\n5(t)]T of system (21) is defined and is bounded on R\n+.

We let \u03c4 (t) = 1 + 1/2sin (t), a\n = 0.045, Z\n = 3\u221710\u22123 and F\n = \ndiag{ ZN, \nZN, \nZN, \nZN, \nZN}. Other parameters are the same as the verification for Theorem 2. We obtain that inft\u2208R+{1-\u03c4\u02d9(t)}\u2a7e1/2. Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that the assumptions (S1) and (S2) are satisfied. We choose \u03c4\u02d9(t)=1/2, and it follows from Corollary 2 that there exist 5-dimensional symmetrical positive definite matrix P, diagonal matrix \u03b1\n = \ndiag\n (2.2773, 2.7832, 3.0514, 1.7118, 2.3170) > 0 such that \u03bb\nmin(D(t)) = 0.9130, whereP=2.9578-0.3050-0.3127-0.86500.0003-0.30502.32760.98021.42940.5805-0.31270.98022.42072.55100.5578-0.86501.42942.55106.22691.09870.00030.58050.55781.09871.6651.Hence, we can see that there exists a constant \u03d6\n > 0 such that \u03bb\nmin(D(t)) \u2a7e \n\u03d6, for all t\n \u2208 \nR\n+. This shows that from Corollary 2, system (21) is globally exponentially stable, as shown in Fig. 6\n, which implies that the treatment or rational immunization for the susceptible or infective individuals may hasten the disease dying out.",

Furthermore, the stability of the model with variable coefficients in five dimensions is analyzed so as to predict the evolution tendency of the disease. One of our goals is to obtain the relatively accurate conditions to ensure the asymptotic stability of the SEIRW model, in other words, to give the practical conditions that the infectious disease will not be diffuse infinitely and disappear gradually. This study can quantify the effects of human interference behaviors like vaccination on the diseases spread. Furthermore, we introduce the time-varying delay into the susceptible individuals and the infective individuals in the SEIRW model and analyze the global exponential stability of the SEIRW model with time-varying delay. Our results show that rational immunization for the susceptible or infective individuals may hasten the disease dying out. Finally, the numerical simulations verify the results.",

The study takes into account such human interference behaviors and quantifies their effects on the spread of the infectious diseases. Thus, some key efforts might be made to public healthy authorities, for example, rational immunization could be acceptable only in the case where the spontaneous baseline vaccination rate fulfills the reverse of inequality. The challenge to the infectious disease epidemiologist is to resolve the concealed determinants of the human interference behaviors of the transmission of the infectious disease and discriminate rules that could enable effective controls to be identified and this behavior to be predicted.",
