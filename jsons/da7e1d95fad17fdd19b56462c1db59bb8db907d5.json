DIFFICULTY in the identification of Phlebotomus arises from the small size of the insects, and from the fact that in most cases specific characters are found only in the internal structures so that each specimen has to be cleared, dissected under the binocular, and then examined under low and high powers of the microscope before it can be identified. I n our experience the greatest difficulty of all arises from the scattered nature of the literature, which is, nevertheless, copious. Sinton (1932 nevertheless, copious. Sinton ( , 1933 published illustrated keys for the identification of males and females which form a useful starting-point as regards the Indian species. I n our studies of the sandflies of the Sudan, extending now over twelve years, we were at first much impeded by the fact that no similar guide was available for the Ethiopian species. We found that the only way to avoid confusion was to copy from the various journals descriptions and figures of each species, and to bind these abstracts together in a single file. By so doing we were able to collect in convenient form an up-to-date account of all the species which had been found in the Sudan and adjacent countries. From this it was possible to construct keys and diagnostic tables which proved of great assistance in the identification of specimens.",

There are ten abdominal segments, the first seven of which are readily recognizable by the ventral pseudopod on each. On the dorso-lateral margin of the eighth segment there is a small spiracle, situated on a chitinous tubercle (metapeustic larva). The ninth segment bears on a chitinous plate a pair of characteristic, long, caudal bristles which are held erect as the larva crawls about. There are two unequal bristles a t the sides of the tenth segment, and the eleventh segment is represented by a pair of membranous pads between which the anal opening lies. The body segments bear characteristic bristles with globular swellings a t their apices. The structure and arrangement of these bristles differ in different species.",

In some species the larva can withstand a certain amount of desiccation and freezing, but as they usually live some distance below the surface of the soil they ale largely protected from such adverse climatic conditions as heat and desiccation in the Sudan or intense cold in Northern China.

When fully grown the fourth larva stops feeding and, selecting a suitable spot, becomes motionless with its head and most of the body raised in a very characteristic erect attitude. At this stage the larva may have an opaque swollen appearance due to the formation of the pupa inside the larval skin. The pupa by its movements splits the skin along the dorsal surface of the thorax and then worms its way out through the rent, the head of the larval skin passing along its ventral surface. The pupa of Phlebotomus has a very characteristic appearance, as the last larval skin is always attached to the end of it and the four caudal bristles, even if broken off short, can always be made out a t the end of the larval skin.

The developing imago can usually be made out through the thin skin of the pupa (pupa obtecta), and when seen from the front has been described as resembling the head of a ram in miniature, the antennae of the developing fly representing the horns of the ram. The imago emerges through its pupal case by a straight cut in the dorsal surface (orthorrhapha). The dorsal surface of the thorax protrudes through the rent, which then allows the rest of the thorax and the head to emerge ; lastly the legs and wings are drawn out. Emergence is completed within a few minutes, and then rotation of the terminalia through 180 degrees occurs. The pupal skin left behind is clearly recognizable as that of Phlebotomus. Time occupied by the different stages. The time occupied by the complete cycle varies with temperature and season. At Matadi in the Belgian Congo Wanson (1942) found that it varied between 51 and 56 days in P. schwetzi, P. africanus and P. squmnipleuris. I n North Africa Parrot (1932) observed periods about three times this duration in the case of P. papatasi. These periods do not include any period of diapause. In places where there is a wellmarked sandfly season the life cycle may be greatly lengthened by a period of diapause in those broods which hatch out at the end of one season and reach maturity at the beginning of the next one. Some observations on the duration of the different stages in the life cycle are given below.",

Once gorged the female does not fly more than a few feet from the place where she has fed, but seeks the nearest place of refuge which offers suitable conditions of darkness, still air and humidity. Digestion of the blood meal is completed in about 72 hours a t 28\" C. and the eggs are laid 30-36 hours later.",

The soil fissures are often automatically filled or covered by irrigation, seasonal rains, or the trampling of people or animals. I n the Sudan it has often been noticed that houses on the periphery of a town near the untrodden cotton soil are more infested by P. papatasi than those in its centre.

They are delicate insects, and many features of their bionomics depend on the fact that they do not readily withstand much variation from those optimum conditions, especially as regards temperature and relative humidity. Unless conditions are optimal the females of some species refuse to feed and die of starvation. Theodor (1936) has shown that a t 30\" C. and a relative humidity of 40 per cent. the mean length of life of fed female P. papatasi was 3.5 days, while the thermal death point in a 1-hour exposure was 41\" C. Condensation of water vapour from the atmosphere may also be harmful as they readily become entangled and drowned in the drops of water thus formed. I n most places where sandflies are prevalent they exhibit a more or less marked seasonal variation in numbers. I n some regions there is a well-defined sandfly season, the prevalence of the flies being restricted to a few months of the year. The seasonal variation in numbers is closely correlated with meteorological conditions, and thus varies in different areas according to the climate. The dominating factors are temperature, humidity, rainfall, insolation and wind, especially the first three. I n most places sandflies disappear during the heavy rains. This is so in the Sudan (Kirk and , Abyssinia ( Martin, 1938 ) and the Belgian Congo (Wanson, 191 'L), and in these regions the greatest prevalence occurs just before the rains and, later, shortly after them. Adler and Theodor (1931) have drawn attention to the diurnal periodicity of certain species in the Mediterranean zone, by which it is possible to predict almost to an hour when members of a particular species will appear inside houses. I n the Sudan a similar diurnal periodicity has been Seasonal prevalence.",

P. sqiiarnipleuris, though ubiquitous, is associated with damp conditions, e.g., the edges of pools and banks of rivers ; it is attracted to artificial light more than other species, and hence often comes into lighted mosquito-proofed verandahs. Kirk and Lewis (1947) concluded that the survival of sandflies in some arid areas is due in large measure to their exploitation of a vast subterranean environment, consisting of animal burrows and cracks in the soil in which equable conditions of temperature (27\" C.) and relative humidity (approximately 100 per cent.) exist in spite of wide fluctuations above ground. From this subterranean environment they emerge in search of food only after darkness, when the temperature falls and the relative humidity in consequence rises, thus providing suitable climatic conditions for them. Many no doubt find nourishment in animal burrows and in the soil fissures which are inhabited by scorpions, lizards, bats, and other insects besides sandfhes. The obliteration of the soil fissures annually by the rains is probably an important factor influencing the seasonal prevalence of Phlebotomus.",

Some authorities believe that the males never feed although they are provided with piercing and sucking mouthparts as in the females. It has often been suspected that in the absence of suitable animal hosts sandflies suck the juices of plants. Smith, Halder and Ahmed (1940) found it was possible to maintain them in the laboratory by allowing them to feed on raisins, which they did by piercing the skin with the proboscis and sucking the juices. None of the Ethio-pian species have been observed to feed on plants in nature, but it has often been suspected that certain Neotropical species do so, and the remarkable proboscis infections with Bartonella-like organisms described by Hertig (1938) were considered to have been derived from other sources than blood meals. I n some uninhabited, semi-desert areas of the Sudan animal hosts appear scarce, yet sandflies may emerge at night in such large numbers as to suggest that most of them must die without ever having a meal unless they have some alternative food supply. The contents of the oesophageal diverticula of seven female P. papatasi caught a t Wad Medani were examined by chromatographic analysis by Mr. H. D. Fowler.

Newcomers to a sandfly country often develop a skin eruption of urticaria1 type. Face, arms and legs are covered with intensely irritating papules, some of which develop into blisters filled with clear or sometimes haemorrhagic fluid. They may become septic through scratching so that the original clinical picture is obscured. I n Palestine, where the condition is known locally as \" harara, \" Dostrowsky (1925) concluded on the basis of clinical observation that it is '( nothing else than the reaction to sandfly bites\" in newcomers to the sandfly country. Experimental work shows (Theodor, 1935 ) that a process of sensitization to the bites takes place in a relatively short time and is followed later by a slow process of desensitization. Theodor concludes that the \" harara \" of Palestine represents the reaction to sandfly bites a t the height of the sensitization process. The possibility that leishmaniasis might be transmitted by Phlebotomus was first envisaged by the Sergents (1905) and Pressat (1905) . In 191 1 Wenyon observed leptomonads in wild-caught sandflies in Aleppo, and considered the possibility that these might be developmental forms of L. tropica. Tn 1921 the Sergents, Parrot, Donatien and Bequet produced a typical oriental sore in a man in Algiers by inoculation of crushed sandflies collected in Biskra, a well-known endemic centre of the disease. After much unsuccessful experimental work it was finally shown by Adler and Ber (1941) that P. papatasi can transmit oriental sore by the bite from one human being to another.",

The specific sand fly vector is different in the different endemic areas, but may be recognized by the facts : (1) that its distribution agrees with that of leishmaniasis, (2) that it is comparatively easy to infect with the local leishmania ; (3) that the infection in the sandfly extends forwards into the head (pharynx and prepharynx) ; (4) that the infection does not die out, but persists for the remainder of the life of the sandfly ; and (5) the sandfly is sufficiently prevalent to maintain the cycle of infection. On these criteria P. papatasi can be regarded as the vector of' oriental sore in Palestine, P. sergenti in India and Bagdad. Parrot (1943) names P. roubaudi as the probable vector of oriental sore in the Niger basin. P. argentipes is the vector of kala azar in India, P. chinensis in China, P. perniciosus in the western Mediterranean, 'P. major in Crete, and P. orientalis in the North-Eastern Sudan. I n the Old World in general kala azar is transmitted by species of the major group, oriental sore by species of the sergerati andpapatasi groups. We have suspected that P. clydei, which is outside these groups, may act as a vector in some parts of Africa, but feeding experiments (admittedly on a small scale) have not borne out this supposition. I n the New World leishmaniasis is probably transmitted by several species of Neotropical sandflies.

Doerr, Franz and Taussing (1909) in Herzgovina proved that this disease is transmitted by P. papatasi, and other workers have since confirmed this observation. The distribution and seasonal prevalence of P. papatasi corresponds almost exactly with that of sandfly fever. The causal agent is a filterable virus, and the blood is infective to sandflies for 24 hours before the onset of symptoms and 24 hours after it. The female P. papatasi becomes ipfective from seven to ten days after feeding on a patient with sandfly fever during the period in which the virus is circulating in the blood. Whittingham and Rook (1923) claim to have shown that the infection is transmitted hereditarily to the progeny of an infected P. papatasi.",

In this formula the numerator, in arabic numbers, shows the number of the spines (1 or 2) present on each of the segments, and the denominator in roman numbers shows the serial numbers of the corresponding segments. Thus the antennal formula of a species with two ascoidds on all the TRANS. R. ENT segments from I11 to XV inclusive would be 2/III-XV. The formulae of a specimen with two ascoids on segments 111, IV, V, VI, V I I and one ascoid only on the following segments (VIII-XV) would be B/III-VII, l/VIII-XV. The formula of a species which had two ascoids sometimes on 111-VII and sometimes on 111-VIII and a single spine on VIII-XV or IX-XV would be written 2/III-VII (VIII), l/VIII (1X)-XV. As a rule the antennal formula shows sexual dimorphism in the subgenera dergentomyia and Sintonius, that of the males being 1/III-XV and of the females 2/III-XV. Notable exceptions are P. squamipleuris l/IV-XV in both sexes ; P. mirabilis 6 2/III-VII ; and P. simillimus J,l/IV, 2IV-XV. In the subgenus Phlebotomus there is no sexual dimorphism in the papatasi and sergenti groups (Phlebotomus and Paraphlebotomus of Theodor), the formula being 2/III-XV in both sexes.

The scars left by erect hairs are much larger and more refractile than those left by recumbent hairs. In species of the subgenus Phlebotomus the erect hairs on tergites 11-VI are numerous, usually arranged in tufts a t the distal ends of the segments.

            "text": "Franca (1919) divided the genus Phlebotomus into two subgenera, Phlebotomus and Newstedia, on the characters of the male terminalia. Franca and Parrot (1920) , finding the name Newsteadia was preoccupied, changed the name of t h k subgenus to Sergentomyia, and suggested the creation of a third subgenus, Neophlebotomus, with P. mdabaricus as the type species. No type species was defined for Sergentomyia, but in a later paper in the same year Franca (1920) named P. minutus Rondani as the type species for Sergentomyia. I n 1921 Franca and Parrot proposed a more detailed system of classification in which Sergentomyia, Franca and Parrot, 1920 , is subdivided into Sergentomyia (pro parte), in which the alar index is greater than unity, and Prophlebotomus in which the alar index is equal to or less than unity, and P. minutus is included in the new subgenus Prophlebotomus. Theodor (1948) points out that this is inadmissible under Article 29 of the Rules of Nomenclature, which states that '' if a genus (or subgenus) is divided the type species has to remain with the restricted genus with the same name.\" He concludes therefore that Prophlebotomus has to be considered as a synonym of Sergentomnyia. Neophlebotomus does not appear in the classification of Franca and Parrot (1921) but, as Theodor points out, according to more recent knowledge its type species (P. malabaricus) belongs to the same group as P. minutus and hence comes into the subgenus Sergentomyia, so Neophlebotomus also becomes a synonym of Sergentomyia and cannot be used again as was done by Dyar (1929), who used the name for certain New World species of Phlebotomus. It would appear from Theodor's analysis that the subsequent use of the name Prophlebotomus by Parrot (1934b) and by the present writers (1946) is inadmissible and that the correct name in this case is Sergentomyia. In this work, therefore, the name Sergentomyia will be used throughout in place of Prophlebotomus.",

It now appears that P. minutus is not an Ethiopian species but its synonymy has to be considered in an account of African sandflies. The species P. minutus was created by Rondani in 1843, and later described by Newstead (1911) in an account of the sandflies of the Maltese Islands. I n the following year Newstead (1912) separated P. minutus var. africanus from the typical P. minutus Rondani on account of its darker colour and certain differences in external characters. Fourteen years later Adler and Theodor (1926) drew attention to the internal characters (buccal cavity, pharynx and spermatheca) on which the determination of species of Phlebototnus is now largely based. In two Palestinian forms which had previously been determined on external characters as P. minutus and P. minutus var. afiicanus, they found that the differences in external characters were correlated with differences in internal structure and accordingly raised the variety to specific rank as P. africanus Newstead. A collection of Phlebotomus determined on external characters as P. minutus and P. africanus was found to contain P. africanus and two other species, one similar to the P. minutus of Palestine, the other a species which could not be differentiated from P. minutus on external characters, but showed very clear differences from P. minutus in the buccal cavity and pharynx.",

Many of these forms are very similar to each other, being separated by minor differences only. Re-examination of Newstead's type specimens of P. antennatus by Kirk and Lewis (1950) shows that they are all closely allied to this species and might very well be regarded as varieties of it. I n this work the Ethiopian forms previously regarded as varieties of P. mi,nutus, and some allied species, are treated as varietks of P. antennatus Newstead. P. mintstus Rondani is essentially a Palaeaxctic species and does not occur in the Ethiopian Region. Previous records of this species are therefore invalid as they refer t o some other species, most commonly P. antennatus or one of its varieties.

Since the different classifications suggested often entail differences in nomenclature and no system has yet been universally accepted, the various schemes which have been proposed for the Old World species are summarized and briefly discussed below. According to Theodor (1948) the New World species are not well enough known for a definite classification. Most of the species which have been fully described have a buccal armature which differs from that of the Old World species, but a few of the species have no armature. It is uncertain at present whether the American species without a buccal armature can be put into the same group as the Old World species without a buccal armature or will have to be separated. Theodor puts them provisionally into a separate genus, Brumptomyia Pranca and Parrot, the American species with a buccal cavity being placed in the genus Lutzomyia Franca.",

A similar division was used by Sinton (1924) in compiling a diagnostic table of the males of the Indian species. Franca (1919) made an attempt to classify the species of Phlebotornus by dividing them into two subgenera on the characters of the male genitalia. After suggesting karious madhcations of this system, which are mentioned on page 406, Franca and Parrot (1921) divided the genus into five subgenera, namely, Phlebotomus, Prophlebotomus, Brwnptomyia, Lutaia (emend Lutaomyia Franca, 1924) and Sergentorn,yia. I n this classification Prophlebotomus was separated from the other subgenera by the alar index being less than unity in Prophlebotomus, and greater than. or equal to unity in the other subgenera. The remaining subgenera were separated according to differences in the male genitalia. This classification was unsatisfactory in many ways. I n a later publication Parrot (1934) points out that the scheme was conceived as a guide to further work and research rather than as a categcjrical affirmation of definitive characters.",

In 1927 Sinton found that Newstead's division into erectand recumbent-haired species was correlated with definite morphological characters in the buccal cavity and spermatheca, species of the erect-haired group having no buccal armature and spermathecae with a crenulated or segmented appearance, while in those of the recumbent-haired group the spermatheca has a smooth outline and a buccal armature is present.

Parrot agrees, however, with the primary division into species which possess a welldeveloped buccal armature and those which do not, but states his opinion that it is hardly justifiable in the present state of knowledge to undertake any further subdivision of the genus at the present time, a t least as far as the Old World species are concerned. He points out that the first group corresponds in large measure with the subgenus Prophlebotomus of Franca and Parrot (1921) , and divides the genus into two subgenera, which are defined as follows : Phlebotomus : Bouche inerme ; indice alar superieur ou au moins egal a l'unite ; poils des tergites abdominaux uniformement dresses ; parasites habituels des animaux t i sang chaud. Type : P. pupatasi (Scop., 1896). Parrot, 1921 : bouche armee de dents ; indice alar generalement inferieur ou B peine egal a l'unit6 ; poils des tergites abdominaux uniformement ou presque uniformement couchkes ; parasites habituels des animaux B sang froid. Type: P. minutus Rondani, 1843 . Sinton (1928a) found wing venation a variable character, unsuitable for primary division, as did Magnitsky and Cutzewitsch (1929) , while several species of the subgenus Prophlebotornus have since been recorded as Vicious biters of man (cf. Kirk and Lewis, 1940) . The primary division into those forms which have a buccal armature and those which do not is, however, a convenient one, because it enables any single male or female, the precise determination of which is doubtful, to be assigned to the appropriate group.",

The females correspond with Nitzulescu's definition of the subgenus Sintonius, and there is considerable uniformity among the males of this group, all those which have been described so far having terminalia of the minutus type with hooked parameres and pointed penis.

Sintonius d8ers from Phlebotomus in having a buccal armature, and from Prophlebotomus in having scanty erect hairs on the abdominal tergites and segmented spermathecae and may be considered as intermediate between the other two subgenera. Of the three subgenera suggested by Kirk and Lewis Sintonius is the most homogeneous The subgenus Phlebotomus includes several forms, such as P. gigas, P. lesleyae and P. heischi, in which the spermathecae are peculiar. In the subgenera Phlebotomus and Prophlebotomus (= Sergentomyia) of Kirk and Lewis there is considerable variety in the structure of the male, and this has been made the basis of further subdivision by Sinton (1927) and Theodor (1948) . Theodor (1948) has proposed a much more elaborate classification of the PHLEBOTOMINAE. He recognizes two genera in the old World, Phlebotomw s.",

This character is the relatively large sixth abdominal segment, which is often evident on examination with a hand lens. In addition, Sinton (1932) has pointed out that in specimens which have been mounted, especially if stained, it is comparatively easy to determine the original disposition of the hairs on the abdominal tergites from a study of the scars left on the segments by these hairs.",

Theodor (1947) states that there are at least five different forms of P. chinensis from India, Persia, Syria, Cyprus and Roumania which may eventually have to be separated as varieties or species. Lewis and Kirk (1939) have described differences between the African and Indian forms of P. clydei. Differences between the African and Indian forms of P . spuarnipleuris have led to the separation of the latter as var. indicus (Theodor, 1931) .

Kirk and Lewis (1947) noted that sandflies from the arid northern regions of the Sudan tend to be less heavily pigmented than those from the more humid south, and it is possible that the differences between P. schwetzi and its variety nigricans are due essentially to the expression of this tendency.",

In 1936 Parrot described from Abyssinia P. langeroni var. orientalis, in which the penis is non-bifid but the antenna1 formula is similar to that of P. perniciosus. The specimen reported by Theodor (1938) from the Sudan as P. langeroni was probably var. orientalis, but as the antennae were missing this could not be decided. In a study of P. langeroni and allied forms, Parrot and Clastrier (1946) concluded that P. langeroni differed as much from the variety orientalis as from two allied species, P. longipes and P. longicuspis, and accordingly raised the variety to specific rank as P. orientalis Parrot, 1936 . : c, terminalia.

P. antennutus Parrot, 1942, Arch. Inst. Pasteur AlgCr. 20 P. antennatus was originally described by Newstead (1912 Newstead ( , 1920 ) as a distinct species, but later Xewstead and Sinton (1921) thought the evidence then available was insufficient to separate it from P. rninutus and placed it as a variety of that species. Sinton (1933) later found that the differences between both male and female forms of Indian specimens were so great that he considered that P. antennatus should again be raised to specific rank, although the identity of the Indian forms with Newstead's African species was uncertain. U'ith Parrot's (1942 Parrot's ( , 1943 re-description of P. minutus Rondani it is evident that the various forms regarded as P. antennatus can no longer be considered varieties of P. minutus Rondani, and Parrot, 1930.) from the Congo as P. minutus var. antennatus was regarded by that worker (1942) as P. signatipennis. I n 1948 the writers were able to re-examine Newstead's African type specimens of P. antennatus and found that this form is closely related to P. signatipennis, P. cinctus and other forms given specific rank by Parrot (1943) when he found that they could no longer be regarded as varieties of P. minutus. I n this work these and some allied forms are treated as varieties of P. antennatus Newstead. The subject is discussed more fully in the section on synonymy (page 407). The description of the female given below is Newstead's type series (holotype female and seven other female specimens).",

Buccal cavity : with 10-12 equal rather large pointed teeth on an arc slightly concave posteriorly ; anterior to these a row of small denticles each of which is placed opposite a space between the posterior teeth ; pigmented area pale brown, subtriangular, with an anterior prolongation, sometimes absent. Pharynx : with a characteristic shape, three times as wide posteriorly as anteriorly, sharply constricted posteriorly, denticles inconspicuous and in optical section having the appcarance of oblique scales and iine parallel folds. Wing : length 1.3-1.6 mm., breadth 0.3-0.38 mm., alar index 0.6-1, delta + 0.04 to + 0.12 mm. Spermatheca : an elongated cylindrical capsule with a very wide duct. 8.

Pharynx: in general shape like that of P . schwetzi. denticles less pointed than in the female. Adler, Theodor and Parrot described as P. simillimus Newstead a species from the Belgian Congo which agreed in its external characters with Newstead's description of that species. Re-examination of Newstead's specimens showed later that the two species were distinct and the one from the Congo was re- cavity ; e, terminalia.

Unsworth and Gordon (1946) have reviewed their methods, and described their own work on P. papatasi, and the following account is abstracted from their work. Whittingham and Rook (1922) were the first to establish a colony of P. papatasi which they bred for three or more generations in Malta, using a chamber containing earth and stones with moist organic matter for oviposition and larval development. and later Young et al. (1926) and Napier and Smith (1926) , confined naturally-fed female flies in glass cylinders and, after two or three days, transferred them to other cylinders standing on a damp plaster of Paris tray containing pebbles and rabbit faeces as food for the larvae. After the eggs had hatched, the cylinders were replaced by an earthenware cover to ensure moisture and darkness for the larvae. Christophers et al. (1926) , instead of plaster of Paris, used Petri dishes lined with damp filter paper bearing food for the larvae. Shortt et al. (1926) substituted earthenware saucers for Petri dishes and added a little dried blood to the rabbit and goat faeces used for larval food. Ashner (1927) found that this grew moulds, and used one part of garden soil and two parts of rabbit faeces, mixed with water and stirred while drying. The flies of most laboratory colonies have been fed on human blood, but Wanson (1942) used lizards. Smith et al. (1940) fed the flies first on human blood and subsequently on raisins. All the work done on breeding Phlebotomus emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high humidity without allowing water to condense and entangle the flies. Unsworth and Gordon (1946) bred P. papatasi in England in an incubator at 30\" C. using two different methods the second of which was adopted to reduce labour.",

About 50 per cent. of flies, which had taken a first meal on a kala-azar patient and then been fed on raisins, were alive after ten days, but Unsworth and Gordon (1946) achieved comparable results with P. papatasi without raisins. Kirk and Lewis (1949) kept sandflies singly in tubes a t a constant temperature and constant high humidity, so that no condemation occurred and the conditions could easily be repeated. Each tube measured 5 by 2.3 cm., was closed with muslin, and contained a piece of filter paper to support the fly and absorb its faeces. The tubes were placed over a solution of caustic potash giving a relative humidity of 90 per cent. in a desiccator which was kept in an incubator a t 27\u00b0C.

Within the Ethiopian Region one can already see the characteristics of the Phlebotornus faunas of several of Chapin's Provinces. In the Guinean Forest Province 15 species and four varieties have been found, six of which, P. bedfordi var. medius, P. lumsdeni, P. crosarai,rP. freetownensis, P. renauxi and P. richardi, appear to be restricted to the Province. P. bedfordi var. jrmatus, P. schoutedeni, P. simillimus, P. freetownensis var. niger, P. ingrarni, P. collarti, P. decipiens and P. dureni form a group which is evidently centred on this Province. Of the remaining five fornis three are widely distributed in the Region. No species of Sintonius has been found in the Guinean Forest Province. I n the Guinean Savanna Province 22 species and six varieties are known of which seven species have not yet been found in other areas-P. buxtoni, P.",
