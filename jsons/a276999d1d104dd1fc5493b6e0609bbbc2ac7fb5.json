In addition to the standardized data collection, we have significantly added to current ERS/ATS standards of lung function measurements in infants 23, 24 and to the development and standardization of additional non-invasive lung function techniques. 9, Early programmers of lung development Since the beginning of our prospective birth cohort, we have investigated physical properties of the airways in infants prone to wheeze. 9 We showed that not only bronchoconstriction, but also impaired airway growth, plays a role for the development of wheeze. 27, 29 Even without current wheeze, infants with a past history of wheeze display altered airway wall mechanics. This might be due to remodelling or independent developmental differences already present at birth. This emphasizes the importance of early programmers of lung development. 30, 49, 50 Outdoor air pollution might be such an early programmer. By modelling outdoor air pollution exposure during pregnancy, we found that exposure to PM 10 was associated with altered lung function in newborns and that NO 2 levels were associated with elevated FeNO levels after birth, indicating the induction of inflammatory response in infants. This was enhanced if mothers smoked during pregnancy but independent of maternal atopy. 12 Although atopy is a risk factor for allergic asthma, this adds to the hypothesis that lung development and evolution of allergic asthma might be partly independent processes, which are both influenced by early programmers. 25, 51 Prevalence, risk factors and prognosis of respiratory symptoms in early life We were among the first to present prospective data on respiratory symptoms in a cohort of unselected infants. The incidence of symptoms was increased in infants of asthmatic mothers, whereas maternal hay fever was inversely related to the number of symptoms. 52 High FeNO levels after birth were associated with severe symptoms during the first year of life in the offspring of atopic mothers, which was again pronounced if mothers smoked during pregnancy. 53 Thus, FeNO after birth might be an important predictor of later respiratory symptoms and morbidity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 459, "end": 461, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 637, "end": 638, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 761, "end": 764, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 765, "end": 767, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1050, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1054, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1057, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1491, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1718, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1721, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2061, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2259, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "What has been found?

[54] [55] [56] Additionally, we showed that Human Bocavirus (HBoV), a picornavirus isolated in children with lower respiratory-tract infections from several retrospective and hospital-based studies, is also associated with respiratory disease in healthy Swiss infants, and reported that HBoV circulates in an endemic fashion in the community, thus confirming the worldwide distribution. 54 Early mechanisms and markers related to airway inflammation, the development of the immune system and childhood wheezing disorders We were able to add towards the knowledge about the effects of environmental triggers on airway inflammation. We found that smoking during pregnancy has an effect on components of the innate immune system of the offspring. Total leucocyte counts in cord blood were significantly lower if mothers smoked during pregnancy. The decrease was most prominent in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells and lymphocytes. 57 Investigating the impact of outdoor air pollution on cytokine levels as of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, for which large changes are seen after exposure to high pollution levels such as after bushfires, we found only small effects in cord blood of healthy term infants. 58, 59 Assessing the quantitative effect of the acute-phase plasma collection mannose-binding lectin (MBL) on respiratory morbidity, we found that low levels were only weakly associated, and high levels more strongly associated, with the incidence and severity of respiratory symptoms during the first year of life, particularly in infants with asthmatic parents. 60 What are the main strengths and weaknesses?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 328, "end": 332, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 333, "end": 337, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 710, "end": 712, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1259, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1572, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1575, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1933, "end": 1935, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The role of viral triggers for early respiratory-tract infections"}, {"text": "The BILD cohort, with its unique data set of comprehensive lung function data, particularly during infancy, is an integrative and interdisciplinary framework to analyse how predisposing factors affect lung development from pregnancy through childhood and to predict later risk of respiratory disease.

Measurements are performed according to the latest recommendations by the ERS and ATS; often we were even stricter. For instance, for the analysis of tidal breathing at the age of 1 month, we used 100 instead of 30 breaths as currently recommended, for better accuracy. 21 There is still enough flexibility to develop new lung function testing methods. 32, 36 To validate exposure to air pollutants, we have started to assess individual exposure to air pollutants using passive samplers, which is expensive and has yet been rarely used in studies assessing the effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on lung function.
