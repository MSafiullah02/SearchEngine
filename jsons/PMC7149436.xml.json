            "text": "Human adenovirus1 (Ad) has been used extensively to derive replication-incompetent gene delivery vectors to correct genetic disorders and develop candidate vaccines for a variety of infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy, and as conditionally replicative Ad (CRAd) agents for cancer virotherapy. Adenovirus vectors have been used in 22% of all gene therapy clinical trials, followed by retroviral vectors (19%) and naked/plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (18%).2., 3. A major factor limiting the effectiveness of current-generation Ad vectors is their inability to accomplish specific gene delivery to cells of interest. Indeed, a National Institutes of Health report identified the \u201cneed for vector targeting\u201d as a central objective for the field of gene therapy.4 Extensive studies of interactions between Ad capsid proteins and host cells in vitro revealed that efficient Ad infection requires the presence of sufficient levels of receptors responsible for virus attachment to the cellular membrane and internalization. Adenovirus attachment to the cell is mediated by fiber binding with its C-terminal knob domain to a primary cellular receptor. Subsequent interaction of \u03b1v\u03b23/5-integrins, the secondary cellular receptor, with an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence within a protein loop extended from the penton base is required to trigger endocytosis resulting in virus internalization. Most Ad of species B have been shown to use human membrane cofactor CD46 as the predominant attachment receptor5 whereas the coxsackievirus group B and Ad receptor (CAR)6 has been identified as the primary high-affinity receptor for many representatives of species A, C, D, E, and F.7., 8., 9. Therefore, levels of CD46 and CAR expression determine the infection efficacy of Ad serotype 35 of species B and Ad serotype 2 (Ad2) or 5 (Ad5) (both of species C), respectively, which are mostly used for vector construction purposes. Thus, an unfavorable expression pattern of primary Ad receptor in a clinical context would result in an insufficient level of infection of target cells while leading to ectopic virus sequestration by nontarget tissues. The delineation of key steps of the Ad cellular entry pathway in vitro, in which cell attachment is distinct from subsequent virus internalization, suggested that Ad recognition of cognate primary receptor represents a rate-limiting step, which could be intervened in an effort to redirect virus-cell binding via an alternative cellular receptor to confer susceptibility to Ad vector infection. Transductional targeting strategies seek to redirect Ad binding to appropriate nonnative receptors to increase the efficiency of gene transfer to the cell type selected to achieve therapeutic intervention.",

Although successfully demonstrating the feasibility of in vitro virus retargeting via non\u2013Ad receptors displayed on human venule endothelial cells, intestinal smooth muscle cells, and resting T cells that are normally refractory, this approach was later abandoned, apparently because of reduced virus viability resulting from RGD sequence deletion.20 An alternative approach to provide adapter binding to Ad capsid was proposed by Douglas et al.,21 based on the use of neutralizing mAb 1D6.14, which blocks binding of the Ad5 fiber knob to CAR. The feasibility of Ad retargeting via a nonviral receptor was demonstrated by conjugating the Fab\u2019 fragments of mAb 1D6.14 to folate to allow virus linkage to the folate receptor, which is overexpressed on the surface of a variety of malignant cells. This Fab\u2013folate conjugate was complexed with Ad5 vector carrying the luciferase reporter gene and was shown to redirect virus infection of target cells via the folate receptor at a high efficiency. When complexed with Ad5 carrying the gene for herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, the Fab\u2013folate conjugate mediated the specific killing of cells that overexpress the folate receptor. This work demonstrated the feasibility of employing an adapter approach both to ablate endogenous viral tropism and to introduce novel tropism in vitro.",

            "text": "Based on these essential findings, an adapter approach was employed to promote Ad-mediated gene transfer in dendritic cells (DC) to assess its targeting utility in the context of important therapeutic applications proposed for genetically modified DCs. To this end, Tillman et al.26 tested Fab\u2019 fragment (1D6.14) chemically conjugated to mAb G28-5 agonistically binding DC\u2019s receptor CD40.27 The CD40 receptor is attractive for DC targeting because it has an important role in inducing DC maturation and priming cytotoxic T cells.28 Ad5 vector retargeting via the CD40 pathway using this bispecific construct dramatically enhanced gene transfer to monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) established from peripheral blood of normal human volunteer donors and induced both their phenotypic and functional maturation as demonstrated by increased T cell stimulation in an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction and by enhanced interleukin (IL)-12p70 release.26 To explore the potential of an adapter-mediated targeting approach to enhance the efficacy of DC-based vaccinations in vivo, Tillman et al.29 employed a similar Fab\u2019 conjugated with mAb FGK4530 against mouse CD40 (mCD40) along with Ad vector encoding a tumor antigen. To this end, AdE7 vector expressing the human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 oncogene, which represents an attractive target for antigen-specific immunity of cervical cancer, was coupled with Fab-anti-murine CD40 and then was used to load bone marrow\u2013derived DCs (BMDCs) ex vivo. It was shown that subcutaneous injection of BMDCs infected with CD40-targeted AdE7 provided superior protection against HPV-16\u2013induced tumor challenge and improved prophylaxis against outgrowth of established tumors relative to BMDCs infected by untargeted Ad. This study illustrated that Ad-modified DCs may be used in repeated vaccination to establish antigen-specific and CD8+ T cell\u2013dependent protection. These findings suggested that Ad-based DC loading with tumor antigens can elicit productive antitumor immunity and that the enhancement of gene transfer and DC maturation mediated by CD40-targeted Ad complex may facilitate this process.",

            "text": "To achieve a strong association between viral particles and adapter proteins, several groups proposed combining genetic capsid modification with a targeting adapter approach. To this end, the Ad5 fiber capsid protein was genetically fused to the C-terminal biotin acceptor peptide (BAP).77 Adenovirus 5 particles bearing this BAP were metabolically biotinylated during vector production by the endogenous biotin ligase in 293 cells to produce covalently biotinylated virions. The resulting biotinylated vector could be retargeted to new receptors by conjugation to biotinylated antibodies using tetrameric avidin (Kd\n = 10\u221215\n M). Campos et al.78 used a panel of metabolically biotinylated Ad vectors to directly compare targeted transduction mediated through the fiber, protein IX, and hexon capsid proteins using a variety of biotinylated ligands including mAb, transferrin, EGF, and cholera toxin B. This study clearly demonstrated that effective cell targeting could be achieved only when biotinylated fiber protein served for receptor-binding ligand conjugation. In contrast, protein IX and hexon-mediated ligand conjugation with the same ligands failed to provide vector targeting, likely because of aberrant trafficking at the cell surface or inside targeted cells. These data suggested that Ad targeting will likely be the most efficient through fiber modification rather than pIX or hexon protein. Using Ad5 vector containing metabolically biotinylated fiber proteins, Chen et al.79 showed retargeting to primary cultured human corneal epithelial cells, which was mediated by conjugation with biotinylated EGF, providing up to ninefold increased transduction of EGFR-expressing corneal epithelial progenitor cells while reducing transduction of differentiated corneal epithelial cells. A biotin\u2013avidin linkage was also used to conjugate Ad vectors to ligands that bind with high affinity to ChemR23, \u03b1v\u03b23-integrins, and DC-SIGN receptors80 to improve the efficacy of human MoDCs transduction, maturation, and ability to stimulate cytokine production by autologous memory CD8+ T cells against the vector-encoded immunodominant human cytomegalovirus pp65 protein compared with untargeted virus. This study expanded the range of receptors that could be employed for DC targeting to facilitate the development of Ad-based vaccines.",

Korokhov et al.82 showed that targeting ligands containing the Fc domain and either an anti-CD40 scFv or CD40L form stable complexes with Ad vector incorporating the so-called Cd of S. aureus protein A, which resulted in significant augmentation of gene delivery to MoDCs target cells. Using a similar approach of genetic fiber modification to insert a synthetic 33\u2013amino acid IgG-binding domain (Z33) derived from protein A, Volpers et al.81 demonstrated up to a 77-fold increased gene transfer efficacy in differentiated primary human muscle cells, which was achieved by preincubation of the AdFZ33 vector with mAb directed against neuronal cell adhesion molecule or \u03b17-integrin. This versatile Ad targeting strategy was employed by Kawashima et al.84 to demonstrate highly efficient gene transfer in biliary cancer cells using AdFZ33 vector combined with mAb against EpCAM or EGFR compared with the control antibody or without antibody. This study showed that AdFZ33 vector, which was constructed to express uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, complexed with anti-EpCAM or anti-EGFR mAb, remarkably enhanced the sensitivity of biliary cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil but not cells lacking EpCAM or EGFR expression including normal hepatocytes and thus resulting in significantly suppressed growth of biliary cancer xenografts in nude mice. Employment of this versatile IgG-binding Ad vector approach holds promise to solve the problem of structural and biosynthetic compatibility between viral capsid proteins and targeting ligands by allowing direct use of the available repertoire of mAb against cell surface antigens for Ad targeting to a variety of cellular receptors.",

Thus, virus interaction with its primary attachment receptor does not appear to be essential to attain the effective cell entry. (2) Achievement of CAR-independent infection via alternative cellular receptors allows augmented levels of gene transfer. Indeed, redirecting Ad5 infection via nonviral receptors allows improving the susceptibility of target cells in vitro and in vivo.

These chimeric fibers are primarily derived from viruses that employ different receptors for cell binding including CD46,85 CD80/CD86,86 and desmoglein-2.87., 88. In early studies, the use of a method to construct an Ad5/3 vector containing chimeric fibers composed of the tail and shaft domains of Ad5 and the knob domain of Ad serotype 3 (Ad3) was established.89 More recent studies demonstrated high transduction efficacy of Ad5/3-based vectors in a variety of Ad5-refractory tumor cell types with low CAR expression including renal cell carcinoma,90 ovarian cancer,91 melanoma,92 and prostate cancer cells.93 Several fiber chimeric Ad vectors have been developed to achieve tumor- or tissue-specific gene delivery by employing fibers derived from Ad35, Ad40, or Ad19p.94., 95., 96., 97., 98. Over the past decade, additional approaches to Ad retargeting were developed using fibers from nonhuman Ad species. A number of fiber-xenotyped Ad5 vectors were developed based on chimeric fibers with knob domains from aviadenovirus or atadenovirus,99 canine Ad serotype 2 (CAV-2),100 canine Ad serotype 1 (CAV-1),101 and porcine Ad serotype 3 and 4 (PAd3 and PAdV-4).102., 103. In addition to fibers from nonhuman Ad vectors, a fiber-mosaic Ad5 vector encoding two different fibers including the wild-type Ad5 and the receptor-binding molecule of Dearing (T3D) reovirus serotype 3 was constructed. Use of fiber-like \u03c31 attachment protein provided enhanced infectivity in tissues with low CAR expression and tropism expansion via infection of cells expressing sialic acid and junction adhesion molecule 1.104\n",

In this regard, a fiber-mosaic strategy of capsid modification in which single viral particles can incorporate two distinct fiber species was evaluated using mosaic Ad5 vectors with fibers derived from wild-type Ad5 fiber and FF6H protein consisting of the amino-terminal segment of Ad5 fiber sequence genetically fused with the carboxy-terminal portion of the phage T4 fibritin protein, followed by the linker and the 6-His ligand.105 In another study, Murakami et al. generated a fiber-mosaic Ad vector displaying both Ad5 fiber and a chimeric fiber protein composed of the Ad5 tail domain and the Ad3 shaft and knob domains. The capacity of the dual-fiber Ad vector to transduce distinct cell types in a mixed cell population was demonstrated in vitro. This fiber profile allows the expanded tropism required for an inclusion targeting strategy, which is based on the use of fiber-mosaic viral particles that can infect cells efficiently with a distinctive receptor\u2019s repertoire.106 More recent studies have demonstrated that employment of fibers derived from both Ad5 and Ad3 increased oncolytic potency of CRAd. An experimental therapy study using a human pancreatic tumor xenograft model demonstrated that employment of complex mosaicism increased efficacy of the combination of oncolytic virotherapy with chemotherapy.107\n",

            "text": "Several strategies have been developed to alter tropism of Ad5-based vectors to achieve a cell-specific gene delivery by employing fiber modifications using genetic incorporation of targeting motifs. Generally, retargeting strategies have focused on Ad fiber modifications, because it is the major determinant of Ad tropism. It was shown that insertion of an integrin-binding RGD motif or polylysine peptides into the C-terminus of the fiber knob significantly reduced the transduction efficiency of CAR-positive cells by Ad vectors.108 In early studies, the use of an exposed HI-loop structure connecting \u03b2-sheets H and I in the Ad knob domain as an alternate location for the cysteine-constrained RGD-4C (CDCRGDCFC) peptide insertion was demonstrated by Dmitriev et al.109 Based on evidence that RGD and polylysine (pK7) motifs bind to different cell surface proteins, cellular integrins, and heparan sulfate\u2013containing receptors, respectively, double-modified Ad fiber knob with RGD and pK7 motifs have been shown to enhance Ad5 infection via CAR-independent pathways and improved gene transfer efficiency.110 Promising data have been demonstrated in studies in which the phage display technique was used to determine specific binding peptides. The display of polypeptide repertoires on the surface of filamentous phages as well as peptide incorporated Ad libraries was shown to be a valuable method for isolating unique peptides that can be employed for Ad targeting. In vivo selection of phage display libraries and Ad libraries displaying random peptides on the fiber knob techniques were successfully employed to acquire a number tumor-homing peptides with a targeting specificity related to angiogenic blood vessels (CDCRGDCFC and CNGRCVSGCAGRC),111 tumor lymphatic vessels (CGNKRTRGC),112 pancreatic cancer (SYENFSA),113 and renal cell carcinoma (HITSLLS).98 Phage display technology was used to isolate an HVGGSSV peptide that binds specifically to tax-interacting protein-1 receptor in irradiated tumors.114 Although these modifications allowed for tropism alterations, in many instances the application of this approach has been limited by incompatibility between the capsid and ligand. In addition, targeting motifs fused to the fiber protein demonstrated decreased binding functionality or an impaired proper protein tertiary structure.115\n",

Furthermore, the biosynthesis of candidate Ab species designed for Ad incorporation must be compatible with Ad capsid protein synthesis and assembly. To this point, available Ab species have not proved to be biologically compatible with cytosolic Ad capsid synthesis and assembly, resulting in loss of binding affinities. This loss of binding specificity, in the instance of incorporated scFv, is likely because Ad capsid proteins are normally synthesized in the cytosol with assembly in the nucleus, whereas scFv molecules are typically routed through the rough endoplasmic reticulum.120 In this context, the redox state of the cytosol likely results in improper scFv folding that perturbs the structural configuration required for antigen recognition, leading to loss of binding specificity. Despite the demonstrated utility of stabilized scFv with molecular scaffold motifs designed to resist the deleterious effect of the cytosol redox state for Ad retargeting,116., 121. the limited available repertoire of target specificities of this class of scFv practically restricts this approach.",

Although not universally accepted, liver uptake of Ad is mediated by high-affinity interaction between the major protein in the Ad5 capsid, hexon, and \u03b3-carboxylated glutamic acid domain of coagulation factor X (FX). The Ad5\u2013FX complex attaches to hepatocytes through binding of the serine protease domain of FX to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.131., 132., 133.

Incorporation of an \u03b1v-specific DCRGDCF ligand in the HVR5 of hexon resulted in enhanced transduction of cells with low levels of CAR expression.139 In another study, the 6-His epitope was incorporated in HVR2 and HVR5.140 It was shown that HVRs 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are amenable to insertion of a 6-His motif. In addition, anti\u20136-His Ab recognized Ad vectors with 6-His inserted into HVRs 2 and 5.110 A subsequent study demonstrated that HVR5 of hexon was capable to accommodate a peptide up to 36 amino acids (aa) in length141 as well as the 71-aa BAP protein142 with minimal adverse effects on virion stability. It was later shown that substitution of HVR7 of the Ad5 hexon with HVR7 from Ad3 resulted in decreased liver tropism and dramatically altered biodistribution of gene expression. Systemic administration of AdH5/H3CMVLuc, AdH5RoboLuc, and AdH5/H3RoboLuc in C57BL6J mice produced Luc expression in the liver that was 59- and 431- and over 240,000-fold, respectively, lower than wild-type AdH5CMVLuc. The results of these studies suggest that the combination of liver detargeting using a genetic modification of hexon with an endothelium-specific transcriptional control element produces an additive effect in the improvement of Ad5 biodistribution.143\n",

The MYC-tagged-pIX molecules were readily accessible to anti-MYC Ab.144 In early studies, use of pIX for genetic incorporation of targeting ligands was established by Dmitriev et al.145 In this study, Ad vectors containing modified pIX carrying a C-terminal Flag epitope along with a heparan sulfate binding motif consisting of either eight consecutive lysines or a polylysine sequence were constructed. The pIX variants were efficiently incorporated into the capsid of Ad particles. Using an anti-Flag Ab, it was shown that modified pIXs are incorporated into virions and display Flag-containing C-terminal sequences on the capsid surface. The incorporation of a polylysine motif into the pIX ectodomain resulted in significant augmentation of Ad fiber knob-independent infection of CAR-deficient cell types.145 Using this strategy, Ad retargeting was achieved by incorporating large targeting moieties, including eGFP,146 HSV1-tk,147 and metallothionein.148., 149.\n",

The strategies described above including the use of bispecific adapter molecules and the genetic incorporation of targeting ligands into capsid proteins were extensively developed to redirect Ad5 infection via nonnative pathways. Targeted Ad vectors hold the promise to expand the types of diseases that can be treated by gene therapy and to make the therapeutic applications of Ad vectors more effective. The increased specificity achieved by targeting virus infection to cells of interest will ultimately allow lower and safer doses of Ad vectors to be provided when regional or systemic delivery is contemplated in the future.",

Recent studies focused on the biology of interactions between Ad capsid components and host blood factors and their influence on systemic virus biodistribution revealed the ability of the vitamin K\u2013dependent coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and protein C to bind trimeric hexon in the viral capsid and facilitate CAR-independent infection of hepatic cells after intravascular Ad5 vector administration. These efforts serve to highlight the complexity of virus\u2013host interplay in the artificial blood-borne environment and have identified modifications of the fiber and hexon proteins that significantly decrease infection and virus-induced toxicity in the liver. Thus, it is recognized that the infection pathway of systemically administered Ad5 is mediated via multiple mechanisms involving blood factors rather than direct virus interaction with cellular receptors. On this basis, it becomes increasingly apparent that engineering of capsid proteins to overcome ectopic sequestration in the liver coupled with virus retargeting via a nonnative infection pathway represents a rational strategy to direct Ad vector localization to the tissue of interest subsequent to systemic vascular administration. In this regard, genetic engineering of the Ad fiber protein appears the most straightforward way to generate targeted Ad vectors with novel tropism.\n",

On the basis of these deliberations, the use of alternate Ab species that might embody a stability profile compatible with the cytosolic biosynthesis of Ad capsid proteins was considered. Camelid hcAbs possess characteristics ideal for an Ad retargeting strategy: (1) cytosolic stability allowing functional incorporation into the Ad capsid and (2) compatibility with phage biopanning selection to allow target cell specificity. Based on these useful attributes, a number of targeted Ad vectors using genetic incorporation of sdAb into fiber-fibritin or pIX proteins have been developed. This finding provides an important technical approach allowing practical linkage of capsid modification of Ad vector and ligand-based strategies for targeting gene delivery.",

The utility of adapter molecules constructed using an anti-Ad5 knob scFv or the sCAR ectodomain is obviously limited to Ad5 and other CAR-binding Ad serotypes. This provides a rationale for the development of a new class of protein adapters capable of Ad vector targeting by virtue of binding to alternative capsid epitopes.
