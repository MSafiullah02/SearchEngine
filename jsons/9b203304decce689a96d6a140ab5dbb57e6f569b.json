First, we collect a global dataset on internet searches indicative of economic anxieties. We find that the arrival of coronavirus in a country led to a substantial increase in such internet searches of up to 58 percent. Second, leveraging two US representative survey experiments conducted in early and mid-March 2020, we document a rapid surge in economic anxieties after the arrival of the coronavirus in the US. Third, to understand how information about the coronavirus affects these anxieties, we measure perceptions about the coronavirus. We find substantial heterogeneity in participants' beliefs about the mortality from and contagiousness of the virus. Fourth, experimentally providing participants with information about mortality and contagiousness causally affects participants' worries regarding the aggregate economy and their personal economic situation. Finally, we document that participants' subjective mental models understate the non-linear nature of disease spread, and that these mental models shape the extent of economic worries. These results underscore the importance of public education about the virus for successful containment as well as the need for timely measures that decrease economic hardship and anxiety during a major global pandemic.",

In this regard, a major worry is that a rise in consumers' income and employment risk weakens their economic stability and economic sentiment. Canonical theories of economic demand and the psychology of markets [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] highlight the detrimental effect of dampened economic sentiment in depressing aggregate demand and worsening economic downturns. To shed light on this issue during the current global crisis, we draw from observational data on internet searches indicative of economic anxieties and two US representative survey experiments. We assess the impact of the global spread of the coronavirus on economic anxiety, investigate the role of information in driving these anxieties and document underlying psychological mechanisms.",

As shown by prior studies, such internet searches serve as an accurate predictor of future economic demand and activity as they capture the sentiment on the consumer side of the economy [7, 8] . We validated this claim by relating economic output as well as individual components of aggregate demand to the pre-quarter search intensity for the Google search topic 'Recession' in country-level regressions controlling for country and year-by-quarter fixed effects. Using quarterly data from 2015 to 2019 we find that real GDP growth and real growth in consumption and imports are significantly lower in the quarters following increases in Recession topic searches (Fig 1A and Supplementary Table 1) . A 100% increase in search intensity for recession-related topics is associated with a 1.6 %-point lower consumption growth rate and a 1 %-point lower GDP growth rate in the following quarter. Hence, these search intensities are a leading indicator of subsequent aggregate demand contractions and economic downturn.",

Similarly, the fraction of respondents who were worried about the impact on their personal economic situation increased from 47% to 74% (p < 0.001) (Fig 2D) . In the experiment, we measured participants' beliefs about two important characteristics of the coronavirus: mortality and contagiousness (R0) (for procedures and elicitation see Supplementary Material). There was substantial heterogeneity in participants' beliefs about these statistics ( Fig. 3A and 3B ). On average, participants' beliefs about both the mortality from the coronavirus as well as its contagiousness were higher relative to official and scientific estimates. The median participant estimated a mortality of 5% (mean of 14%) relative to an estimate of 3.4% provided by the WHO. 3 Similarly, the median participant estimated a contagiousness (R0) of 10 (mean of 43) relative to scientific estimates at the time of the survey in the range of R0 \u2248 2 [14, 15] . Consistent To understand whether beliefs about the mortality and contagiousness causally af-fect economic sentiment, we administered two information treatments. First, we focus on the role of beliefs about mortality. In the experiment, participants were either truthfully informed, based on estimates at the time of the survey, that the death rate from the coronavirus is \"20 times higher than for the flu\" (high mortality treatment) or \"5 times lower than for SARS\" (low mortality treatment). The wording was chosen to mirror information provision as it is commonly communicated in the media. 4 We then studied how the information treatment affected participants' expectations about the severity of the effects of the coronavirus in general, and participants' worries about the effects on the aggregate economy and their personal economic situation.",

The difference between treatments in terms of participants' beliefs about the crisis' severity for the US was found to be 0.23 (p < 0.001) standard deviations. Next, we assessed the impact on economic worries To complement this analysis, we also studied the role of information about the contagiousness of the new coronavirus on economic sentiment. Specifically, based on scientific estimates [14, 15] , a random subset of respondents was informed that \"approximately 2 non-infected people will catch the coronavirus from a person who has the coronavirus\" (\"contagiousness information treatment\"), while the remaining respondents received no information (\"no information group\"). Given that the majority of participants held higher beliefs relative to scientific estimates, the information treatment should decrease the perceived contagiousness of the virus.",

As humans are organized in networks, disease spread typically follows a non-linear (e.g. logistic or quasiexponential) function, at least in the beginning of an outbreak [16, 17] . Hence, a small number of cases can rapidly evolve into a widespread pandemic if the contagiousness of a disease is high. Such a trajectory can be vastly underestimated if individuals do not take into account the non-linear nature of disease spread but rather adopt a mental model of more moderate, e.g. linear, growth.",

Complementarily, within the same time frame, aggregate Google search intensity for the 'Recession' topic increased by a factor of 10 in the US and by a factor of 5.5 at the global level (Supplementary Figs 1A-B). 2 Third, to understand the role of information and perceptions about the coronavirus and to shed light on the psychological mechanisms, we embedded an experiment in the first wave of our survey.

            "text": "In contrast to correct prediction values of 31 on day 5, 1023 on day 10, and 1,048,575 on day 20, the median participant estimated a case number of 16 on day 5, 30 on day 10, and 60 on day 20 (Fig 4A). Inconsistent with non-linear growth, the predictions of the median participant could be well approximated by a linear mental model (as exemplified by the green line in Fig 4B for a linear growth rate of 2 per day). A linear mental model, however, was not uniformly present for the entire population. In particular, the 90th percentile prediction in our sample very well captured the correct quasi-exponential growth (Fig 4B). To understand how current economic anxiety is associated with individuals' mental model about the spread of diseases, we again elicited participants' beliefs about the severity of the impact of the coronavirus on the world and the US as well as their worries about the aggregate economy and their personal economic situation. We then studied the association of these outcomes with participants' predicted number of people infected with the fictitious disease on day 5, 10, and 20 (Fig 4C and Supplementary Table 8). To address outliers in people's estimate of the spread of diseases, we used a z-scored transformation of the logarithm of the predicted number of infected people. The data shows a large and statistically significant positive association between people's estimate of the number of infected individuals and participants' (i) beliefs about the coronavirus crisis' severity for the world (p < 0.001) and (ii) their beliefs about the coronavirus crisis' severity for the US (p < 0.001). Moreover, the data indicates a large and significant positive association with participants' worries about the aggregate US economy (p = 0.028). These results indicate that individuals who exhibit a more accurate mental model of non-linear growth in disease spread exhibit higher worries regarding the coronavirus pandemic, potentially as they foresee a greater potential for a widespread contagion of the global population. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation of participants' worries about their personal economic situation with the predicted number of infected people. This finding squares with previous evidence that individuals do not completely extrapolate their individual risk from aggregate societal risk as it has been documented for instance in the realm of climate change [18]. Combining data from internet searches and two online experiments, the results presented here show that the global spread of the coronavirus has spurred a substantial weakening of economic sentiment and an increase in economic anxiety. The evidence has two important implications for policy making. First, heterogeneity in beliefs about key characteristics of the novel coronavirus is large. Providing information about the coronavirus strongly shapes participants' perception of the crisis and their economic worries.Moreover, people underestimate the non-linear growth of diseases at their initial stages by several orders of magnitudes. These results highlight that public education surrounding the coronavirus is important to ensure that the public has an adequate understanding of the threat of the coronavirus and the nature of the spread of contagious diseases more generally. Ensuring that characteristics of the coronavirus are well known and that the nature of diseases spread is understood will be necessary to help contain the virus and protect the most vulnerable populations which is the first-order priority in this current global crisis.",
