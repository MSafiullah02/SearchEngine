            "text": "Critically ill infants with impaired cerebral pressure autoregulation are at significant risk for brain injury [1\u20134]. Typically, cerebral pressure autoregulation maintains a relatively constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) over a range (the cerebral pressure autoregulation plateau) of cerebral perfusion pressures (CPP, the gradient between arterial blood pressure and cerebral venous pressure), thereby buffering variations in systemic arterial blood pressure [1, 3]. Normally, cerebral venous compliance is significantly greater than arterial compliance, and hence venous pressure is usually much lower than arterial pressure. Cerebral venous pressure is usually low and not easily measured, particularly in small sick infants. Therefore, its effect is often disregarded, and arterial blood pressure is used as the surrogate for CPP. When CPP is no longer on the cerebral pressure autoregulation plateau, the cerebral circulation becomes pressure passive, and changes in CPP result in parallel changes in CBF [3]. Particularly in conditions with high risk for systemic hypotension (e.g., critically ill newborn infants), elevation of cerebral venous pressure will decrease CPP and eventually abolish the cerebral pressure autoregulation. Positive-pressure ventilation is often required to support the critically ill newborn, and may cause significant fluctuations in intrathoracic, and hence, cerebral venous pressure and volume [5]. Of note, a piglet model showed a significant correlation between cerebral oxygen saturation and venous oxygen saturation measured from jugular bulb [6].",

            "text": "The integrity of cerebral pressure autoregulation may be measured using the concordance between CPP and CBF changes; as cerebral pressure autoregulation fails, CPP and CBF become more closely correlated [3]. Studies in high-risk newborns have shown that cerebral pressure autoregulation may wax and wane over the course of critical illness [3], making periodic point estimates of cerebral pressure autoregulation unreliable. In order to detect and respond to cerebral pressure passivity appropriately, continuous cerebral pressure autoregulation monitoring is needed. We have used the technique of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for continuous monitoring of cerebral perfusion at the bedside of sick newborns [3, 7]. We have previously validated continuous NIRS-derived hemodynamic signals in animal models as reliable surrogates for CBF to allow for the continuous, noninvasive derivation of cerebral pressure autoregulation [8]. For this study, our goals were to evaluate the association between cerebral venous volume changes at the ventilator frequency on the development of (1) cerebral pressure passivity, and (2) brain injury, in newborn infants undergoing intensive care. We hypothesized that higher ventilator-related changes in cerebral venous volume would predict periods of cerebral pressure passivity, and that higher venous volume changes would predict brain injury.",

            "text": "In this retrospective study, we analyzed data collected from infants undergoing conventional positive-pressure mechanical ventilation in the neonatal and cardiac intensive care units of Children\u2019s National Hospital. The study population included infants with three broad categories of illness, all known to be at significant risk of brain injury, namely, term/near-term infants with either perinatal hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) or congenital heart disease (CHD), as well as preterm infants (<37 weeks of gestational age (GA)). It is important to note that the purpose of our study was not to analyze the impact of disease conditions on the relationship between positive-pressure ventilation and brain injury. The HIE infants all met inclusion criteria for, and were treated with, induced hypothermia between 2011 and 2016 [9]. All CHD infants requiring surgery within the newborn period were studied, and they were recruited from years 2012 to 2014. Premature infants were recruited from years 2011 to 2015. We excluded from the study infants with obvious syndromic diagnoses or known cerebral malformations. All data were acquired in prospective studies approved by the Children\u2019s National Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained in all cases. Continuous recording of changes in cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) and deoxygenated Hb was performed using NIRS (NIRO 200, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). The cerebral NIRS data were measured from the frontotemporal regions over both cerebral hemispheres (as previously described) [7, 10]. The arterial blood pressure signal was collected from the analog port of the Philips MP70 bedside monitor (IntelliVue, Philips, MA, USA). Continuous recordings of NIRS and invasive arterial blood pressure were sampled at 1 kHz, time locked, and saved into files using custom software developed in Lab View (National Instruments, TX, USA). The clinical variables, including GA at birth, postnatal age, gender, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), circulating Hb concentration, use of sedatives (phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, morphine, and fentanyl), use of vasopressor medications (dopamine and epinephrine) administered to the infant during our study period, and death during hospitalization, were retrieved from the medical record.",

            "text": "All analyses were performed offline using MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). To exclude possible direct confounding effects within the autoregulation frequency (0.05\u20130.25 Hz), we only included data from infants with a ventilator rate frequency greater than 0.25 Hz. For each cycle of the blood pressure, the peak systolic and trough diastolic pressures were identified. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as the linear combination of one-third of systolic pressure and two-thirds of diastolic pressure. For further analysis, MAP was converted into a uniformly sampled signal using a cubic spline function with a sample rate of 5 Hz, and the NIRS signal was downsampled to 5 Hz. Next, we derived the cerebral hemoglobin difference (HbD) signal (HbD = oxygenated Hb \u2212 deoxygenated Hb) and the total cerebral Hb (HbT = oxygenated Hb + deoxygenated Hb) from the NIRS measurements. We used HbD and HbT as surrogates for CBF and cerebral blood volume (CBV), respectively, as previously described [8, 11]. The continuous MAP, HbD, and HbT signals were partitioned into 10-min nonoverlapping epochs, and the coherence between MAP and HbD (coherenceMAP\u2013HbD) was calculated for each epoch [8, 11]. The coherence in a frequency band was considered statistically significant if it was above the mathematically defined threshold of 0.3842 [12]. The impulse response time for the MAP\u2013HbD interaction during intact cerebral pressure autoregulation is between 5 and 20 s [13]. On this basis, we consider significant coherence between the MAP and HbD in the frequency band of 0.05\u20130.25 Hz to reflect cerebral pressure passivity. To study the effect of ventilator-related cerebral venous volume changes on cerebral pressure autoregulation, we categorized epochs as cerebral pressure passive (coherenceMAP\u2013HbD > 0.3842) or cerebral autoregulating (coherenceMAP\u2013HbD \u2264 0.3842). Next, we calculated the power spectral density HbT (SHbT) for changes at the ventilator frequency in every 10-min epoch to quantify venous volume fluctuations. We used the maximum power in the frequency band of 0.3\u20131 Hz, which is dominated by the ventilator oscillations, that is, there was a distinct peak at the ventilator frequency in the power spectrum of HbT.",

The SHbT values were compared between two cerebral hemispheres using a Student\u2019s t test, and averaged if there were no significant differences. The clinical variables associated with pressure passivity or brain injury/death were identified using Fisher exact test or Wilcoxon test. The following clinical variables were included in the model: gender, sedation use, pressor support, midazolam (seizure medication) use, GA, pCO2, and circulating Hb. Using significantly associated clinical variables and SHbT, a random effect model was developed to predict pressure passivity. To predict brain injury, a logistic regression was built using the average of SHbT and pressure passivity, calculated from all 10-min epochs. Of note, we did not average the raw HbD\u2013MAP coherence values; rather, we averaged the number of epochs that were pressure passive or autoregulating. In our earlier studies, we defined the pressure-passivity index as the percentage of study time the infant was pressure passive [13].",

Our current findings suggest that fluctuations in cerebral venous volume, in the setting of positive-pressure ventilation, may be another such factor.

While the inclusion of infants with different high-risk conditions makes the population heterogenous, it might bring in confounding variables, such as disease condition and GA at birth. In our study, GA at birth was not significantly associated with the relationship between cerebral venous volume changes and pressure passivity. In addition, we assumed (as have others) [5] that cerebral HbT changes occurring at the positive-pressure ventilatory frequency were occurring on the venous side of the cerebral circulation alone. While entirely plausible based on current understanding, this fact cannot currently be confirmed. Within subjects, fluctuations in the spectral power of HbT were noted during constant ventilator settings, suggesting that other as yet unknown factors may be playing a role in these complex hemodynamics. For example, in preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks of GA, cerebral oxygen saturation increases during the first 72 h of life, at a rate of 1% per GA week at birth [30]. Identifying such factors was beyond the scope of this study and should be pursued in future studies. Another limitation includes the methods used to diagnose brain injury; in this retrospective study, the timing of neuroimaging and its relationship with the hemodynamic studies differed across the three diagnostic groups. In addition, a minority of infants underwent US only. For these reasons, the potential causal relationship between the hemodynamic and neuroimaging findings cannot be resolved by the current data, and will require prospective evaluation.",

Furthermore, we show that such cerebral venous volume changes are readily detectable by NIRS, a monitoring device now widely available in most major centers. The importance of these findings and their application in brain-oriented neonatal care will require larger prospective studies.",
