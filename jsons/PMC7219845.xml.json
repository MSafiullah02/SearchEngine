Endoscopy procedures with anesthesia pose additional risk for transmission of COVID-19 infection to providers in the room due to intubation and extubation, which are aerosolizing procedures. Even moderate sedation with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has added risks as patients without a secured airway tend to cough, aerosolizesecretions, and/or require manual airway support (including intubation) in the midst of the procedure.",

It is prudent that, at a minimum, all patients with risk factors (travel within 14 days, exposure to a positive patient, fever with or without respiratory symptoms) be tested the day before their procedure. Furthermore, as highly sensitive diagnostic tests (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 become widely available for routine use, we urge institutions to be cognizant of the risks associated with GI procedures and endeavor to institute testing of asymptomatic patients in these areas. We must remember that procedural areas such as endoscopy are not only associated withhigh patient volumes areas but also associated with prolonged AGP interventions.",
