It has infected so many people worldwide in a short period of\ntime, resulting in a high number of deaths.1\nThe World Health Organization declares influenza pandemic due to the high infection number of\nthe new flu caused by the swine-original influenza A(H1N1)\nvirus,2 one strain of\nH1N1\nviruses. The best defense against this new flu will be the development of effective\nvaccines1 and medicines that can cure it.\nAuthorities check people carefully in airports, train stations, and harbors, hoping to prevent\nthe spread of the disease. They also decontaminate airplanes, trains, ships, and other\ntransportation vehicles with disinfectants. The authorities also urge people to wash their\nhands and mouth with disinfectants to protect against this disease. There are a few new\ndisinfectants.3 However, an environmentally\nfriendly disinfectant is needed to fight these types of outbreaks. Acidic ozone water (AOW) is\na very effective means of eliminating microbes. It is particularly useful for sterilizing\nbacterial endospores.4 In this context, the\ninfluence of AOW on the sterilization of H1N1\nviruses (A/Singapore/6/86) is investigated here. AOW deactivates H1N1\nviruses very effectively. After the disinfection of the viruses, AOW eventually becomes plain\nwater5\u20137 and leaves no residue or\nharmful materials in the environment.",

The virus inactivation in this study is loss of\nthe reproducibility due to outside influences. Therefore, the following inactivation study\nconcentrates mostly on loss of the infectivity. The evidence of inactivation is represented by\nthe decrease of viable virus number estimated from virus titers11 after exposed to AOW. In order to observe the influence of organic\ncompounds in nature on the ozone concentration and on the kill properties, an original virus\nsuspension was prepared that consisted of a high concentration (100%) of chicken allantoic\nfluid, which is harmless to the virus. In fact, human influenza viruses tend to thrive in this\ntype of prepared chicken allantoic fluid, which has high concentrations of many types of\norganic compounds. The survival data for H1N1\nviruses exposed to AOW with pH\nvalues of 4 and 7 at the original high concentration (100%) of chicken allantoic fluid was\nobserved. The ozone in AOW decays very quickly due to the high concentration of the chicken\nallantoic fluid in water. The high concentrations of organic materials from the chicken\nallantoic fluid hinder any inactivation mechanisms of the acidity and ozone on the viruses.\nTherefore, there is no evidence of any inactivation activity of AOW on the viruses at this\nhigh level of contamination with the chicken allantoic fluid, although there is a slight\nreduction in the number of viable viruses in AOW with a pH\nvalue of 4.",

            "text": "Several points are noteworthy in this virus-inactivation study. First, the ozone decay time\n\u03c4 must be independent of the initial ozone\nconcentration in the linear ozone decay represented by Eq. (1). However, the ozone decay time at n03=20 mg/l\nregardless of the pH\nvalue is considerably longer than that at n03=10 mg/l\nin Table I, indicating nonlinearity of the ozone decay\ndata. This nonlinearity may be caused by multiple components of the organic materials in the\nchicken allantoic fluid. The ozone may decay very quickly at the beginning due to the organic\nmaterial from the chicken allantoic fluid, but it may decay slowly at a later stage after the\norganic materials are gone. This stepwise disappearance of the organic materials may also\ncause the nonlinearity in the ozone decay data. Second, the pH\nvalue of 4 in Figs. 1 and 2, and in Table I represent its value in the AOW. However, in reality, two\nparts of AOW were mixed with one part of contaminated water at pH=7\nin the inactivation experiment. Therefore, the amount of hydrochloric acid for two parts of\nthe acidic water at pH=4\nwas used to remake the acidic water of three parts in volume, resulting in a\npH\nvalue of 5.3, as indicated in Ref. 4. It is also shown\nin Ref. 4 that two parts of acidic water at\npH=3\nmix with one part of water at pH=7,\nresulting in three parts of acidic water at pH=4.\nIn fact, a virus-inactivation experiment with AOW at pH=3\nwas conducted in our experiment, resulting in the inactivation of virtually all of the\nviruses. There is no contaminated water at pH=7\nin nature for the dilution of the acidity when AOW is sprayed for virus inactivation.\nTherefore, the acidity of AOW sprayed in the dry environment preserves its original value,\nthereby prolonging the ozone decay time and effectively inactivating viruses. In this context,\nvirus inactivation by AOW may be more pronounced in nature than in the present experiment.\nThird, a TEM image14 of E.\ncoli cells treated by AOW at pH\n4 and with ozone concentration of 20 mg/l indicates the destruction of cell envelopes, showing\nnearly empty cells. Therefore, it is believed that AOW may also destroy virus envelops,\ninactivating their infectivity.",

The ozone decay time \u03c4 in AOW with a\npH\nvalue of 4 is always longer than that when the pH\nvalue is 7, clearly indicating the synergic effect12 of acidic water on the ozone decay activities in water. Therefore,\nthe inactivation effect of AOW is stronger than the sum of the inactivation effect of the\nozone water and that of the acidity. \u201cNot applicable\u201d (N/A) in Table I indicates that all of the viruses were inactivated. Hence, experimental\nmeasurements are not available, and data could not be entered into the table. The scientific\nconditions corresponding to a number less than \u22123 or N/A in the right column\n[log(N/N0)\nat 10 min] in Table I are suitable for virus\ninactivation.
