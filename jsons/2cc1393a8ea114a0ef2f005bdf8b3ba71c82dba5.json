High mortality rates in frail patients is a notable feature of the virus registered since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Above all, elderly patients or those with underlying chronic illnesses and compromised immune system are most at risk (1) . Thus, the consideration is that the possible coexistence, in the same individual, of a cancer diagnosis and a COVID-19 infection could generate a synergistic negative prognostic effect.",

Multivariate analysis showed that a history of cancer was associated with a higher risk of serious/negative events (OR = 5.399, P = 0.003), with a median time in their development of 13 vs. 43 days in non-cancer patients (P < 0.0001; hazard ratio = 3.56, 95% confidence interval = 1.65-7.69).

In a period of social distancing, cancer patients excluded from outpatient and hospital flows should be brought closer to oncologists through the multimedia means of communication and it should deepen the new chapter of telemedicine. A focus should be placed on the delivery of health-related services and information via media/electronic information. It should allow for oncologists to contact all patients that cannot go to the hospital for monitoring on their health status and suggest care when possible. So far, telemedicine would be considered as a strong ligand between patients and oncologists which could guarantee the continuum of care and follow them without losing clinical and human contact. Can we maintain the survival standard by limiting access and therapies? Could we affect the overall quality of life? Or on the contrary, by continuing to administer the same treatment, could we facilitate the spread of the epidemic among these patients by limiting their survival? We believe it is an ethical and moral duty not to abandon these patients in their physical and psychological weakness at this particular historical moment.
