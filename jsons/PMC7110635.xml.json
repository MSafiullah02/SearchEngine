On 25 February he developed fever and myalgia, and later a dry cough, but was not hospitalized until 8 March. Several hours after admission he was intubated and required mechanical ventilation for 13 days. His wife and son were exposed during the period before full protective measures were in place, and both developed SARS with a requirement for mechanical ventilation. The infections in the wife and son were confirmed by RT-PCR testing to be associated with the novel coronavirus associated with SARS worldwide.12, 13, 14 On 26 March a resident of Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens flew to Taiwan and took a train to Taichung. The man's brother became Taiwan's first SARS fatality. Between 14 March and 19 April, 51 people met the criteria for a probable case (Figure 1\n).",

On 18 April he became short of breath. A chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates, and the patient was transferred to an isolation room in the intensive care unit with suspected SARS. This was a potential index patient because he had been symptomatic for six days before SARS was diagnosed. The number of potentially exposed persons was estimated at up to 10,000 patients and visitors, and 930 staff.

The case definition in August was modified to increase specificity by focusing on laboratory confirmed cases.

Within this period between 28 March and 30 July, a total of 151,270 persons (0.7% of the population of Taiwan) were quarantined. Only 46 (class A, 34; class B, 12) were subsequently classified as probable cases. In humans infected with the virus there is a wide range of reported incubation periods, from five to 15 days, before patients become symptomatic.18, 19 This lag time allows apparently healthy people to travel by air almost anywhere in the world after they have been exposed. Once they become symptomatic, the disease is most likely spread through person-to-person transmission.24 As expected, based on the known transmission patterns for SARS,19, 20 the fact that transmission appeared to occur from patients in the symptomatic phase of illness, but not from those who were in the pre-symptomatic phase, suggests that the risk of transmission varies by the phase of illness. It is likely that persons who were in contact with patients with the pre-symptomatic phase were at low risk. The fact that transmission has been limited to only close contacts of patients, such as healthcare workers and family members who were not using contact or respiratory precautions, suggests that either droplet secretions or direct contact probably played a role.4 SARS patients should limit interactions outside the home and should not go to work, school, out-of-home childcare or other public areas until ten days after the resolution of fever. In Taiwan, family and other close contacts, those on airplanes with ill SARS patients (if seated within three rows in front or three rows behind the patient), and those returning from SARS affected areas were given strictly compulsory home quarantine for ten days. It must be considered whether in the future household members or other close contacts of SARS patients need to limit their activities outside the home as recommended by the USA CDC.25\n",

The decrease in worldwide incidence is gratifying; but it may simply reflect the seasonal variation in the transmission of the virus.24 Some experts have predicted the return of SARS in the cool season. Containing an outbreak at an early stage affords a greater chance of success than does a later response and clearly puts less strain on the healthcare system. Future strategies to control the spread of SARS need to emphasize the greater risk to certain populations: health care workers, older people, and people who have chronic diseases. Isolation of cases, stringent infection control measures in hospitals, and vigilant surveillance at both community and population levels are imperative.26, 27, 28\n",
