Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge capacity and limit patient inflow. Triage should identify and geographically cohort symptomatic patients within a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak.

Emergency departments (ED) are the front lines for hospital-and-community-based care, serving as the main points for triaging patients as infected versus non-infected and sick versus not-sick. EDs across the nation are overwhelmed with patient numbers at baseline. A review by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the National Emergency Department Survey showed annual ED visits increased from 89.6 million to 139 million from 2006 to 2017 (an increase of 18.4%).

For example, during the H1N1/2009 pandemic, one study estimated that the rate of ED visits attributable to influenza increased to 1,000 per 100,000, doubling the average annual rate of 500 per 100,000 population for seasonal influenza.

Though many departments throughout the country have disaster preparedness protocols in place, individual outbreaks differ by severity of illness, route of transmission, and level of contagion, which dramatically alters the number of patients presenting to hospital facilities for screening and/or care. Thus a more general guideline, as presented here, will help address the overarching issues that will occur with any viral epidemic/pandemic.

At George Washington University Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, a tent was set up outside the hospital and adjacent to the outpatient clinic building. Patients who arrived to the ED with concern for COVID-19 were directed to the tent and seen by an APP if they met criteria for age, heart rate, and temperature.

It is important to reinforce that cohorting is most effective in the early stages of an outbreak; there may come a point, depending on the level of contagion, where there are too many patients under investigation or confirmed positive patients in the ED and on the inpatient floors to cohort them.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "due to close proximity and department crowding, as highlighted during the 2003 SARS outbreak.(9) Currently, early data from Wuhan and Italy suggest a very high COVID-19 disease burden among healthcare providers.(10) Thus an important aspect of infection control is limiting J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patient-to-provider spread and provider-to-patient spread. A case-control study in five Hong Kong hospitals found that consistent practice of droplet and contact precaution significantly reduced the risk of infection in healthcare workers after exposures to patients with SARS.(11) Another study found that inadequate supply, and inconsistent use, of personal protection equipment (PPE) when in contact with SARS patients were independent risk factors for SARS infection.(12) A case-control study of 254 hospital staff with documented exposure to SARS patients found that consistent droplet and contact precaution was adequate to significantly reduce the number of infections from patient exposures.(11) PPE can be a highly controversial subject with conflicting recommendations from different sources. Current COVID-19 guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the CDC recommend that any healthcare provider (HCP) performing an aerosol-generating procedure on a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient (including endotracheal intubation, open suctioning, NIPPV, and administration of nebulized treatment) wear fitted respirator masks, like N95 or FFP2, along with contact precaution and eye protection.(10)(13) In order to best preserve respirator masks for high-risk procedures, providers working with non-ventilated patients are recommended to wear surgical/medical masks. ED leadership should plan for, and obtain, an appropriate supply of PPE and establish allocation procedures. For instance, in case of shortage, each staff member may be given one N95 respirator per shift that is 'checked out' rather than leaving boxes out in the open, with potential for anxious staff to use or take-home extra.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Nebulizers generate aerosol particles 1-5 \u00b5m in size, with N95 respirators protecting against particles 0.3 \u00b5m or larger. These treatments pose the risk of generating a high volume of small particles and propelling them over a longer distance than the natural air dispersion pattern.(14) This is supported by evidence from the SARS outbreak, where a super-spreading event was largely related to the use of salbutamol via jet nebulizer.(15) Though limited, existing evidence suggests that MDIs, when used correctly, are as effective as nebulized treatments.(16) Thus, EDs will need to increase stock of inhalers and spacers, in addition to instructing staff to preferentially order inhaler treatments. EMS personnel need to be included in this discussion, such that no patient should arrive in a stretcher with a nebulizer actively aerosolizing particles. If noninvasive ventilation (NIV)-limiting strategies are chosen, more aggressive support medications for conditions that normally improve with NIV may be needed: magnesium and epinephrine for COPD, sublingual nitroglycerin and nitroglycerin infusion for CHF. In addition to upstocking, both pharmacy and ED leadership need to confirm Pyxis availability with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f emergent access to these medications readily available. If high volumes of patients requiring respiratory support are expected, additional stock of paralytics, induction agents, and medications for post-intubation sedation should be obtained and made easily accessible.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "One consideration for limiting exposure to aerosolized pathogens is to use video-guided laryngoscopy over direct laryngoscopy as evidence suggests this may reduce the number of failed intubation attempts.(20) COVID-19patients who require mechanical ventilation should be managed similarly to other patients with acute respiratory failure, with special attention to settings that limit ventilator-induced lung injury as ARDS is the cause of death in many patients. A stock of disposable tape measurers for patient height and a wall reference with ideal body weights may help hard-wire appropriate initial settings.The concerns about ventilator shortages must also be addressed. Many states having strategies in place to allocate ventilators during large disease outbreaks. For example, the New York Ventilator Allocation Guidelines uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) to evaluate mortality risk; this, along with exclusion criteria and timed trials, determine a patient's priority level and length of access to ventilator therapy.(21) Hospitals anticipating a shortage may consider strategies to ventilate two patients using a single ventilator.(22) This concept remains highly complex and multifaceted with many ethical concerns.(Table 1)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Amendments to ED Operations during Viral Respiratory Outbreaks Operation Response Considerations Patient volume/triage \uf0b7 Standardize ED admission criteria for patients with respiratory symptoms \uf0b7 Expand inpatient capacity: expedite discharges, cancel elective surgeries \uf0b7 Limit inflow by conducting initial patient evaluation via telemedicine \uf0b7 Triage low-risk patients with respiratory symptoms to an alternate site (medical tent) and high risk patients to a designated ED treatment space Screening patients \uf0b7 Screen via clinical and epidemiologic clues \uf0b7 Current guidelines for COVID testing include individuals with fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness who: o are already hospitalized o are at high risk for poor outcomes o have been in close contact to a COVID-19 patient or travelled to high risk geographic area within 14 days of their symptom onset Cohorting patients \uf0b7 Large health systems can designate one hospital to be the primary hospital for infected patients \uf0b7 Geographically cohort patients with presumed or confirmed infection o Use long shifts and overtime hours to limit staff turnover in these units Infection control and environmental changes \uf0b7 Any patient with respiratory symptoms must wear a mask at all times \uf0b7 Current COVID-19 guidelines recommend any HCP performing an aerosol-generating procedure on COVID-19 patient wear a fitted respirator mask with contact precaution and eye protection o Use negative-pressure rooms for such procedures \uf0b7 Establish new housekeeping protocols with Environmental Services o Add EVS staff during times of peak room turnover Screening/testing HCPs \uf0b7 CDC guidelines for COVID-19 testing among HCPs:", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
