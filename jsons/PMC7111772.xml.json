            "text": "The membrane glycoproteins (GP) of enveloped viruses facilitate infection of target cells through the interaction with cellular receptors. However, binding of virions to target cells is not necessarily mediated by GP interactions with receptor, but can be facilitated by GP binding to attachment factors. Attachment factor engagement is not sufficient to allow infectious entry, but can augment infection. Several cellular lectins can serve as attachment factors. Thus, dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type (calcium dependent) lectin which is expressed at high levels on dendritic cells (DCs), binds human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein (Env) and promotes viral transfer to susceptible cells (\u201cinfection in trans\u201d) (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000). DC-SIGN-mediated HIV infection in trans could aid viral dissemination upon sexual transmission of HIV (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000). Besides HIV, DC-SIGN interacts with a range of other viral (Alvarez et al., 2002, Gardner et al., 2003, Halary et al., 2002, Klimstra et al., 2003, Lozach et al., 2003, Lozach et al., 2004, Marzi et al., 2004, Navarro-Sanchez et al., 2003, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2003, Simmons et al., 2003, Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2004) and non-viral pathogens (Van Kooyk and Geijtenbeek, 2003), which use DC-SIGN to target DCs. Notably, DC-SIGN-mediated enhancement of HIV infection is not limited to concentrating viral particles onto the cell surface (P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001b), but involves internalization and complex intracellular trafficking of virions (Kwon et al., 2002, McDonald et al., 2003).",

DC-SIGNR is expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells in lymph nodes and liver (Bashirova et al., 2001, Mummidi et al., 2001, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001c), and the latter cell type shares several features with DCs (Limmer et al., 2000). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) have been implicated in transmission of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) to adjacent hepatocytes, a process that involves endocytosis and intracellular transport of viral particles (Breiner et al., 2001). Enhancement of viral infection by LSECs and DCs might involve similar pathways, and hepatotropic viruses might specifically target LSECs to promote their spread in liver tissue (Breiner et al., 2001).",

The LSECtin gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3 in the vicinity of the genes encoding DC-SIGN/R and CD23 (Liu et al., 2004). Sequence analysis revealed that LSECtin harbors all invariant and most of the highly conserved amino acid residues characteristic for C-type lectins (Liu et al., 2004). The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of LSECtin exhibits 39% and 38% amino acid sequence identity with the respective domains of DC-SIGN/R and was shown to interact with various carbohydrates, including mannose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and fucose (Liu et al., 2004). However, the ligand(s) of this lectin are unknown.",

In contrast, LSECtin did not functionally interact with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) Env proteins. LSECtin interactions with viral GPs were dependent on calcium, but were not blocked by mannan, indicating that LSECtin and DC-SIGN/R might differ in their carbohydrate specificities.

LSECtin expression was verified with an antiserum generated by immunization of mice with a GST-LSECtin fusion protein produced in bacteria. FACS analysis revealed that serum from immunized mice, but not serum obtained prior to immunization, reacted with cells induced to express LSECtin (Figs. 1B, E). In contrast, no reactivity was observed with uninduced cells (Fig. 1A) or cells expressing DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR (Figs. 1C, D), indicating that reactivity was specific and that LSECtin was expressed at the cell surface to appreciable levels and in a regulated fashion. Similar levels of LSECtin expression were also obtained with transiently transfected 293T cells (data not shown). LSECtin expression in LSEC has previously been demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis of tissue sections (Liu et al., 2004). We employed the LSECtin specific mouse serum to investigate if LSECtin is expressed on the surface of primary LSECs obtained from human liver tissue. Analysis of LSECs obtained from three different donors revealed readily detectable surface expression of LSECtin (Fig. 1F), suggesting that this lectin might contribute to the recognition of blood-borne antigens by LSECs.",

Enhancement of infection was analyzed with 293T cells as targets, since these cells are permissive to infectious cellular entry driven by the above listed GPs. Virus stocks were generated as described (Simmons et al., 2003), normalized for comparable luciferase production upon infection of untransfected 293T control cells, and used for infection of 293T cells transiently expressing DC-SIGN/R, LSECtin, or empty vector (Fig. 2A). Infection is shown relative to infectious entry into control cells, which was set as 100%. In agreement with previous reports (Alvarez et al., 2002, Jeffers et al., 2004, Marzi et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2004), expression of DC-SIGN/R strongly augmented infection driven by filovirus GPs and the SARS-CoV-S protein, but had no appreciable effect on infectious entry mediated by VSV-, MLV-, and Lassa-GP (Fig. 2A). Expression of LSECtin enhanced filovirus GP driven infection with high efficiency and moderately augmented entry by SARS-CoV-S bearing reporter viruses (Fig. 2A). LSECtin expression on non-permissive HeLa cells did not render these cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-S bearing pseudotypes. In contrast, expression of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 (Li et al., 2003) allowed for efficient infection and infectious entry was enhanced upon coexpression of LSECtin (Fig. 2B), indicating that LSECtin functions as an attachment factor, but not as a viral receptor. Comparable results were obtained for DC-SIGN (data not shown), and these observations are in agreement with our previously published results (Marzi et al., 2004). Antiserum raised against LSECtin abrogated LSECtin-, but not DC-SIGN-mediated enhancement of ZEBOV-GP driven infection (Fig. 2C), and augmentation of infection was dependent on induction of lectin expression (data not shown), confirming that enhanced infection was indeed due to LSECtin expression. Thus, LSECtin joins DC-SIGN/R as a potent attachment factor which augments infection driven by certain viral GPs.",

We therefore investigated if these viruses engage LSECtin. In order to assess if LSECtin interacts with HIV-1, T-REx cell lines were induced to express the indicated lectins, pulsed with replication-competent HIV-1 NL4-3 harboring the luciferase gene in place of nef (P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001a), washed three times, and either lysed or cocultivated with CEMx174 5.25 target cells. The content of bound virions in cell lysates was measured by p24 antigen capture ELISA, while transmission to target cells was determined 3 days after cocultivation by assessing luciferase activity in cell lysates. Cells expressing DC-SIGN bound and transmitted HIV-1 about 10-fold more efficiently than control cells and the interaction was inhibited by mannan (Fig. 3A). In contrast, binding and transmission by LSECtin expressing cells was similar to that observed with control cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that LSECtin does not interact with HIV-1. LSECtin interactions with infectious lentiviral particles bearing the HCV E1 and E2 proteins were investigated in a binding experiment as described for Fig. 3A. Pseudoparticles containing the HCV envelope proteins bound to DC-SIGN expressing cells about 3-fold more efficiently than to control cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, binding of pseudovirions to LSECtin expressing cells was comparable to binding to control cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the HCV E1 and E2 proteins are not recognized by LSECtin. Thus, LSECtin exhibits a different ligand specificity compared to DC-SIGN/R.",

Target cells were incubated with the indicated carbohydrates at a final concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml and infected with ZEBOV-GP bearing pseudotypes. Preincubation with d(+)glucose, l(\u2212)fucose, N-acetylglucosamine (Glc-NAc), N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal-Nac), and methyl \u03b1-d-galacto-pyranoside (MetGal) had no appreciable effect on DC-SIGN/R- and LSECtin-mediated enhancement of infection (Fig. 4A). In agreement with published data (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000), preincubation of target cells with mannan or mannose strongly reduced DC-SIGN/R-mediated enhancement of ZEBOV-GP driven infection (Fig. 4A and data not shown). In contrast, these carbohydrates had no appreciable effect on LSECtin-dependent augmentation of infectious cellular entry, indicating that LSECtin interactions with pathogens might not be mediated through recognition of high-mannose glycans. Complexation of calcium by the DC-SIGN/R and LSECtin lectin domains has been shown to be important for carbohydrate binding (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2004). Indeed, preincubation of LSECtin and DC-SIGN/R expressing cells with 5 mM EGTA strongly diminished ZEBOV-GP driven infection (Fig. 4B). In contrast, infectious entry driven by VSV-G, which is not augmented by the lectins tested (Fig. 2A), was only moderately reduced, probably because of toxic effects of EGTA (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the G1 subunit of ZEBOV-GP fused to human immunoglobulin (Ig) bound efficiently to LSECtin expressing cells but not to control cells and binding could be abrogated by preincubation with EGTA (Fig. 4C). Thus, LSECtin requires calcium ions for function as an attachment factor.",

We assessed if these signals are utilized and if N-linked glycosylation is required for expression of LSECtin at the cell surface. DC-SIGN, LSECtin, and LSECtin variants with mutated glycosylation signals were transiently expressed in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, and expression was analyzed by Western blot. Tunicamycin treatment augmented the gel mobility of DC-SIGN, which is in agreement with published results (P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001a), and of LSECtin, indicating that these proteins are modified by N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 5A). Inactivation of the glycosylation signal at amino acids 73\u201375 resulted in faster gel migration compared to wt LSECtin, and gel mobility was further increased upon addition of tunicamycin to the culture medium, suggesting that both glycosylation signals are utilized (Fig. 5A). In fact, inactivation of the second glycosylation signal located at amino acids 159\u2013161 also augmented gel mobility, albeit a band with the size of wt LSECtin was still detected. Upon mutation of both glycosylation sites, a prominent band of the size of tunicamycin-treated LSECtin was observed, further substantiating that both asparagine 73 and 159 are modified by glycans. Analysis of surface expression and attachment factor function of the LSECtin variants with altered glycosylation signals revealed that mutation of asparagine 73 alone strongly reduced surface expression and consequently augmentation of ZEBOV-GP driven infection (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that glycosylation of LSECtin, at least in the context of 293T cells, is essential for efficient expression on the cell surface.",

            "text": "Engagement of cellular attachment factors might profoundly impact EBOV tropism, especially at the early stages of infection (Baribaud et al., 2002). However, the GPs of the four EBOV subspecies bind to attachment factors with differential efficiencies (Lin et al., 2003, Simmons et al., 2003, Takada et al., 2004). Therefore, we asked if LSECtin augments infectious entry driven by the GPs of all EBOV subspecies. T-REx cells expressing DC-SIGN or LSECtin or T-REx control cells were infected with infectivity normalized pseudotypes bearing the GPs of the EBOV subspecies Zaire, Sudan (SEBOV), Ivory Coast (ICEBOV), and Reston (REBOV) (Fig. 6A). As observed previously (Alvarez et al., 2002, Lin et al., 2003, Simmons et al., 2003), DC-SIGN expression particularly enhanced infection driven by ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP, whereas augmentation of entry mediated by SEBOV- and ICEBOV-GP was somewhat less pronounced. Similar results were obtained for LSECtin-mediated enhancement of infection; however, LSECtin was repeatedly more adept in enhancing ICEBOV-GP-dependent infection when compared to DC-SIGN. Thus, LSECtin can interact with the GPs of all EBOV subspecies with appreciable efficiency and might augment infection by these viruses. Since lentiviral and filoviral particles differ in size and shape and GP interactions with attachment factors might depend on the nature of the viral particle on which GPs are presented, we finally assessed if LSECtin expression also enhances infection by replication-competent ZEBOV. T-REx cell lines were induced to express DC-SIGN, LSECtin, or empty vector, inoculated with ZEBOV and infected cells were detected by immunostaining (Fig. 6B). DC-SIGN and LSECtin expression enhanced ZEBOV infection compared to control cells, indicating that both lectins functionally interact with replication-competent filovirus particles.",

            "text": "Engagement of LSECtin and related attachment factors might be of particular relevance for filovirus infection. Filoviruses exhibit an extremely broad cell tropism in vitro (Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998), and viral proteins can be detected in many cell types and organs during the late stage of infection (Geisbert et al., 2003a). In sharp contrast, the viral tropism during the early stages of infection is quite narrow. Thus, macrophages and DCs are early and sustained target cells, and spleen and liver are among the first organs infected (Geisbert et al., 2003a). The discrepancy between the broad tropism late in infection and the limited range of targets early in infection is unlikely to be due to differential receptor expression, but might be explained by EBOV engagement of attachment factors expressed on specific target cells (Simmons et al., 2003). Thus, LSECtin and DC-SIGNR on LSECs might capture and transmit virus to adjacent hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, the latter known to be early targets of filovirus infection (Geisbert et al., 2003a). Capture of DHBV particles and transmission to adjacent hepatocytes has been observed in infected animals (Breiner et al., 2001), providing evidence that LSECs are capable of promoting viral infection in trans. Endothelial cells are targeted by ZEBOV, and in the context of lymph node and liver sinusoids, LSECtin and DC-SIGNR might augment direct infectious entry into this cell type (\u201cinfection in cis\u201d). In fact, endothelial cells of hepatic cortical sinusoids are the first type of endothelial cells found to be infected in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally inoculated with ZEBOV (Geisbert et al., 2003b). Of note, the lectins DC-SIGN, human macrophage C-type lectin specific for galactose and Glc-NAc (hMGL), and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) also augment filovirus infectious entry in vitro (Alvarez et al., 2002, Becker et al., 1995, Lin et al., 2003, Simmons et al., 2003, Takada et al., 2004) and might promote infection of macrophages, DCs (DC-SIGN, hMGL), and hepatocytes (ASGP-R) in vivo, providing further evidence for a potential role of lectins in filovirus tropism. Development of specific inhibitors and the analysis of their impact on filovirus infection of primary cells are required to assess the contribution of each lectin to viral spread.",

            "text": "SARS is a respiratory disease (Peiris et al., 2003a), and a role for LSECtin in SARS-CoV spread in patients is less obvious. However, increasing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV infection is not limited to lung tissue (Hofmann and Pohlmann, 2004), but can be detected in several different tissues and cell types (Ding et al., 2004, To et al., 2004) including hepatocytes (Ding et al., 2004). Some hepatoma cell lines were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-S driven infection (Hofmann et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004) and viral replication (Hofmann et al., 2004), further underlining that SARS-CoV might productively infect hepatocytes. In the light of these results, it cannot be excluded that direct infection of liver tissue might contribute to the altered levels of liver-specific enzymes commonly observed in SARS-CoV-infected patients (Ding et al., 2003, Lang et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003b). Thus, similar as for filoviruses, it can be speculated that LSECtin in conjunction with DC-SIGNR might promote infection of LSECs and/or might target SARS-CoV to adjacent hepatocytes, while SARS-CoV engagement of DC-SIGN on DCs might facilitate viral dissemination (Marzi et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). In contrast to the efficient interaction of LSECtin with SARS-CoV and filovirus GPs, no binding of HIV-1 and HCV GPs to LSECtin expressed on 293T cells was detected. Thus, LSECtin might not be involved in the interactions of lymph node and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells with these pathogens.",

            "text": "One possibility to evaluate the relative contributions of LSECtin and DC-SIGNR to, e.g., LSEC interactions with ZEBOV and SARS-CoV is to exploit differences in the carbohydrate specificities of these lectins. Thus, DC-SIGNR binds exclusively to high-mannose carbohydrates (Feinberg et al., 2001, Guo et al., 2004), and lectin engagement is blocked by preincubation with mannan (Bashirova et al., 2001, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001c), a mannose polymer obtained from the cell wall of yeast. In contrast, mannan did not block ligand binding to LSECtin, indicating that LSECtin might not recognize mannose residues on the GPs tested. Therefore, mannan and related sugars are suitable to inhibit DC-SIGNR but not LSECtin. Notably, apart from mannose, fucose and Glc-NAc also failed to prevent binding of ZEBOV-GP to LSECtin, albeit these carbohydrates have previously been shown to block binding of a mannosylated ligand to a soluble LSECtin-Fc fusion protein (Liu et al., 2004). This discrepancy might be due to differences in the experimental systems used. Thus, carbohydrate inhibition of binding of a mannosylated ligand to a soluble LSECtin-Fc fusion protein was assessed in the previous study (Liu et al., 2004), while we investigated the interaction of cellular LSECtin, which was reported to form tetramers (Liu et al., 2004), with multimeric GPs presented on the surface of virions. Nevertheless, LSECtin interactions with ligand were dependent on the presence of calcium, confirming the previously reported classification of LSECtin as a C-type lectin (Liu et al., 2004). Further analysis will be required to define which carbohydrates on viral GPs are bound by LSECtin and to investigate whether this lectin recognizes other pathogens, which display the appropriate glycosylation pattern.",

Analysis of LSECtin variants with altered glycosylation signals and treatment of lectin expressing cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, provided evidence that both glycosylation sites are utilized and that glycosylation is required for efficient cell surface expression and thus for enhancement of ZEBOV-GP driven infection. In contrast, tunicamycin treatment had relatively little effect on DC-SIGN expression and attachment factor function (data not shown), confirming a previous study, which demonstrated that mutation of a unique, utilized N-linked glycosylation signal in DC-SIGN does not affect interactions with HIV (P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001a). LSECtin and DC-SIGN/R might also differ in regards to internalization and intracellular trafficking upon ligand binding, a function known to be important for DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission by DCs (McDonald et al., 2003). Thus, the DC-SIGN/R cytoplasmic tails harbor LL motifs which, at least in case of DC-SIGN, might be required for efficient receptor internalization and HIV transmission (Kwon et al., 2002). No such motif is present in the cytoplasmic tail of LSECtin; however, sequence analysis identified a YSKW sequence which resembles a YSEI motif in the CD23 cytoplasmic tail known to be involved in internalization of this lectin (Liu et al., 2004). The role of internalization in DC-SIGN- and LSECtin-mediated augmentation of viral infection in cis remains to be determined.",

For regulated LSECtin expression, the open reading frame was inserted in pcDNA4TO (Invitrogen, CA, USA) using the restriction enzymes HindIII and XbaI. For prokaryotic expression of LSECtin, a PCR-fragment spanning the entire LSECtin open reading frame was inserted into pGEX6P1 via BamHI and XhoI (Amersham Biosciences, UK) to yield the plasmid pGEX6P1-LSEC. LSECtin variants with defects in two consensus signals for N-linked glycosylation were generated by PCR mutagenesis employing overlapping oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides 5\u2032Lsec-mut 73AAS75 (GGCCACGACCTGCTGAGGACAGCCGCCTCGAAGCAGACGGCGGCG) and 3\u2032Lsec-mut 73AAS75 (CGCCGCCGTCTGCTTCGAGGCGGCTGTCCTCAGCAGGTCGTGGCC) were employed to alter the glycosylation signal NAS (amino acids 73 to 75), while oligonucleotides 5\u2032 Lsec-mut 159ANS161 (GGAGGCCGTGAGGCTCCAGGCCAACTCCTGCGAGCCGTGCCCC) and 3\u2032 Lsec-mut 159ANS161 (GGGGCACGGCTCGCAGGAGTTGGCCTGGAGCCTCACGGCCTCC) were used to change the glycosylation signal 159NNS161 to 159ANS161. PCR-fragments encoding LSECtin variants with altered glycosylation signals were cloned via HindIII and XbaI into pcDNA3.1Zeo. An expression vector for ZEBOV-GP protein fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin was obtained by inserting the sequence of ZEBOV GP1 in the construct pAB61 (Birkmann et al., 2001). All PCR-amplified sequences were confirmed by automated sequence analysis. The GP expression plasmids employed for the generation of pseudotyped viruses have been described previously (Hofmann et al., 2004, Kolesnikova et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2003, Volchkov et al., 1998).",
