In particular, TMPRSS2 has been implicated as a critical host cell factor for the spread of several clinically relevant viruses, including influenza A viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Recent studies report that the new SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry, followed by proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by TMPRSS2 allowing the fusion of viral and cellular membranes 15, 16 . Moreover, in vitro evidence indicates that TMPRSS2 inhibition by camostat mesylate may be beneficial to prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-2 15 .",

Intriguingly, it has been shown that AR regulates TMPRSS2 expression also in non-prostatic tissues, including lung. In vitro and in vivo results show that androgen administration induces TMPRSS2 expression in human lung epithelial cells and that androgen deprivation reduces TMPRSS2 transcription in murine lung 19 . The androgen-dependent regulation of TMPRSS2 expression in the lung may explain the increased susceptibility of men to develop SARS-CoV-2 severe infections when compared to women.",

The primary end-point of the study was to assess the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1) patients affected by cancer, 2) patients affected by prostate cancer, 3) patients affected by prostate cancer in therapy with or without ADT, and 4) to assess the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the categories above based on patients' hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), or death. Statistical evaluation of the strength of the association between SARS-CoV-2 cases and different types of tumor patients in the male population of the Veneto Region was obtained by means of Odds Ratio (OR).

This feature contributes to the high expression of TMPRSS2 in the prostate gland 18 and the high frequency of genomic rearrangements involving the TMPRSS2 promoter and members of the ETS gene family, particularly ERG, which places this oncogene under the control of the AR30 . In vitro studies demonstrate that TMPRSS2 inhibition may be beneficial to prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-215 . However, few specific TMPRSS2 inhibitors are currently in preclinical/clinical development.The evidence that AR regulates TMPRSS2 expression in non-prostatic tissues, including lung 19 , may explain the increased susceptibility of men to develop SARS-CoV-2 severe infections. This suggests novel potential therapeutic interventions to treat COVID-19affected people. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is known to decrease the levels of TMPRSS2 31 , and AR antagonists could be used to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in male patients, potentially in combination with other inhibitors of viral entry or replication. In addition, other drugs that interfere with positive regulation of TMPRSS2 by AR, AR co-regulatory factors, and transcription factors (e.g., ETS, SP1) could be used to downregulate TMPRSS2 expression and activity in lung and other tissues[32][33][34][35][36] .Besides the regulation of TMPRSS2, androgens could also increase the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in males by modulating the immune response. Androgens can increase the number and function of circulating neutrophils, increase the production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-2,",

Our data are in line with recent reports from China that demonstrated similar trends in male patients and those with cancer 24 .Our study may have some limitations. SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer patients may have been tested at a greater rate than non-cancer patients since these patients are more often hospitalized. This may explain the higher prevalence of infected individuals in the cancer patient population. Prostate cancer patients with ADT may also practice more social distancing than prostate cancer patients with non-ADT and the totality of cancer patients.In sum, these data need to be further validated in additional large cohorts of SARS-CoV-2infected patients and corrected for multiple variables. ADT, based on LHRH agonist/antagonists or AR inhibitors, may be considered to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections or complications in high-risk male populations.
