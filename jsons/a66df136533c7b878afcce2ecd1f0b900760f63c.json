As a result of experience with these infections, it was widely anticipated that future transfusiontransmissible infections would result from viruses causing persistent infection, most probably parenterally transmitted. However, until around the year 2000, most effort relating to emerging infections was directed towards parasitic diseases. Attention was refocused on viral infections as a result of the outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) disease in the USA along with the recognition that it was transmissible by transfusion [1] . This paper will briefly review currently emerging viruses other than WNV, which have been shown to be, or which have the potential to be transmitted by transfusion. Specifically omitted are CMV, EBV, hepatitis A virus and the B19 erythrovirus, which are demonstrably transmitted by transfusion, but which do not fit the current definition of emerging agents.",

The potential for continuing development of new clades and of recombinant viruses continues, and appropriate surveillance is necessary to ensure that sensitive tests are always available.

The disease, in common with most emerging infections, is a zoonosis and it is thought to have been transmitted to humans in south-east China through the preparation of exotic mammals for human consumption, late in 2002 [7, 8] . As its name suggests, the disease manifested primarily with respiratory symptoms, but in the more serious cases, was also systemic. It was extremely infectious by the respiratory route, and probably also by the faecal-oral route. As a result of rapid air transportation of infected individuals, it spread rapidly across the globe. Between 1 November 2002 and 10 July 2003, the WHO reported 5910 symptomatic cases, plus another 2527 for which no dates were available. Fortunately, this single outbreak was contained, and apart from a small handful of cases among laboratory workers, there does not appear to have been a recurrence of the disease.",

The WHO issued recommendations to reduce the risk of transfusion transmission, as did the FDA. These measures included deferral of donors with a history of the disease or contact with a patient and those with a history of travel from an affected area. Even relatively casual travel exposure (such as travel through the airport in Toronto) led to temporary deferral, at least in the USA. Subsequent to the development of these precautions, it became apparent that there could be viraemia during symptomatic disease, but it is still unknown whether there is a presymptomatic viraemia. Additionally, epidemiologic studies showed that there were asymptomatic infections, as judged by the prevalence of antibodies to the SARS coronavirus [11] . Again, however, it is unknown whether such asymptomatic infection is accompanied by viraemia. There were no recorded cases of transfusiontransmission of SARS during the outbreak, although it is unclear whether they would actually have been recognized if they did occur.",

The study adds to the weight of circumstantial evidence, however, that HHV-8 may be transmissible via transfusion.

The disease is somewhat similar to hepatitis A, although it is much more severe in pregnancy. Transmission is by the faecal-oral route and is most often water-borne. The virus is related to the calicivirus group and, as such, is a non-enveloped virus that has an RNA genome. Although there is some evidence (based largely on seroprevalence studies) that HEV is present in the USA, it is found predominantly in tropical countries. Indeed, most cases identified in the USA appear to have resulted from infections that occurred in countries where HEV is endemic. HEV infection is self-limited and acute and it has generally been thought that there is little risk of transmission by transfusion. Until recently, no cases of transfusion-associated HEV infection of disease have been reported [29] . However, a number of recent cases of such transmission have been reported from non-endemic areas, emphasizing that acute infections are also transmissible by transfusion, as long as there is an asymptomatic viraemic phase [30, 31] . This has, of course, been abundantly illustrated by the example of West Nile virus in the USA [1] .",

Three viruses were identified, one of which (termed GBV-C) was found among a number of human sources [32] . Working in parallel, but using a different approach, scientists at Gene-Laboratories isolated viral RNA sequences and characterized a virus they termed hepatitis G virus (HGV) [33] .

However, it has not proved possible to demonstrate that infection with HGV is associated with hepatitis or even with signs of mild liver disease, such as elevated ALT levels. Indeed, HGV appears to be a virus that is currently in search of a disease. The term 'hepatitis' in its name may be a misnomer, attributable only to the fact that the virus was found in association with hepatitis in the first place.

Nevertheless there are relatively few emerging viral infections that have shown any evidence of transmission by this route. There are certainly numerous viruses that have the potential for such transmission and continued vigilance is necessary. There are, however, no clear patterns that will define appropriate target patient groups for surveillance and we will have to continue to rely upon haemovigilance systems and astute clinicians to identify cases of emerging viral infections among blood recipients. Careful and appropriate use of the precautionary principle should also help to maintain the safety of the blood supply.",
