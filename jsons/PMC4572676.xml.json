One fundamental issue is that the sepsis syndrome is characterized by non-specific physiologic abnormalities that encompass a heterogeneous population. Consensus criteria for pediatric sepsis were therefore established to facilitate consistent enrollment across research studies [6]. Many of these criteria have since been adopted for use in clinical practice [8]; however, published reports have demonstrated only moderate overlap of physician diagnosis of severe sepsis with consensus criteria [9, 10]. These findings raise concern that many children diagnosed and treated for severe sepsis in clinical practice may have important physiologic\u2014and outcome\u2014differences from those studied in interventional trials [9, 10].",

Although physician diagnosis serves clinical practice and consensus criteria were intended primarily for research, the alignment of these two methods to identify children with severe sepsis will significantly impact the extent to which study results translate into effective care at the bedside. Moreover, criteria that purposely define a disorder as a decompensated state at one extreme of the entire spectrum\u2014as the existing pediatric consensus definitions currently do for severe sepsis and septic shock\u2014may hinder early clinical diagnosis or delay enrollment in a clinical trial. Although the inherent challenge between research efficacy and clinical effectiveness is not limited to sepsis [14\u201317], understanding the extent to which consensus criteria for pediatric severe sepsis are in agreement with clinical practice will help to improve understanding of the utility of these criteria and to identify ways to improve both physician diagnosis and consensus definitions. To date, the agreement of physician diagnosis with consensus criteria for pediatric severe sepsis has not been evaluated in a large-scale setting.",

Using these data, we determined the level of agreement between consensus criteria [6] and attending physician diagnostic assessment (\u201cphysician diagnosis\u201d) for pediatric severe sepsis.

For severe sepsis screening, organ dysfunctions were defined using pediatric sepsis consensus conference criteria [6], whereas more stringent criteria were used to define NPMODS [21].

This finding is consistent with a prior report of a single-center study in the United States [10]. In general, patients with physician-diagnosed severe sepsis tended to be younger, less severely ill, and less likely to receive several sepsis-related therapies than patients who also met consensus criteria. These observations likely reflect the intention of the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference to identify a more severely ill subgroup of critically ill children with severe sepsis for enrollment in clinical trials [6]. It may therefore be appropriate for physicians to diagnose severe sepsis more often than consensus criteria, particularly in children with a lower severity of illness who may need fewer adjunctive sepsis-related therapies. Physicians may also have been recognizing and treating children with sepsis earlier in their illness course, at a point when they may not yet have manifested the physiologic and laboratory derangements required by consensus criteria. The loss of a statistical difference in PICU mortality between patients identified by physician diagnosis alone and those identified by both definitions after correcting for severity of illness is consistent with these suppositions. A lower threshold for diagnosing severe sepsis in clinical practice likely accounts for the generally better outcome metrics identified in epidemiologic studies using administrative databases [1, 2, 5] than has been reported in clinical trials [20, 27-29]. Our study therefore suggests caution when extrapolating results from epidemiologic, observational, and interventional studies to this less severely ill subgroup of patients who are diagnosed on the basis of physician impression and do not meet consensus criteria. Conversely, the absence of certain features, such as two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria [30, 31], hypotension only after 40 ml/kg of intravenous fluid, and laboratory derangements beyond arbitrary cutpoints (e.g., international normalized ratio >2), should not preclude the clinical diagnosis of severe sepsis and/or septic shock. A refined consensus definition that more closely matches the clinical definition and establishes a spectrum of risk concordant with outcome, similar to that of the recent at-risk, mild, moderate, and severe pediatric ARDS definitions [32], would benefit both research scientists and clinicians.",

This likely reflects that both physician diagnosis and consensus criteria rely on relatively non-specific changes in physiology that are commonly found in critically ill children in general, not just in children with sepsis. Still, this observation highlights an opportunity to refine future iterations of consensus criteria and address variability in physician diagnosis to identify sepsis. Patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders, such as cerebral palsy and epilepsy, were particularly likely to meet consensus criteria for severe sepsis despite an alternative clinical diagnosis. Many of these patients have dysautonomia or altered physiologic responses to illness that make it challenging to apply predefined rigid criteria. The higher rate of unknown primary site of infection suggests that consensus criteria may be less specific than physician diagnosis in identifying patients with a true infection. It is also possible that consensus criteria include PICU patients with a high severity of illness, namely those with shock and multiorgan system dysfunction caused by non-septic insults, who are commonly treated empirically for infection even if clinical suspicion is low. Alternatively, if physician diagnosis does not corroborate consensus criteria despite true presence of severe sepsis, there may be a higher rate of parental or clinician refusal to participate in research because the clinicians managing the patient may not agree on the diagnosis of concern. The incorporation of new biomarkers or novel microbiologic detection systems that improve early sensitivity and specificity for invasive infections into future revisions of the consensus criteria may improve alignment with physician diagnosis.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, physician diagnosis and the application of consensus criteria to identify patients with severe sepsis could not be independently verified. The reasons why patients were not identified as having severe sepsis by one or both definitions were also not available. Although these concerns may have led to misclassification of some patients, it is unlikely that such a bias would have preferentially affected one group. Moreover, because we included only physicians practicing in a PICU setting, 89 % of whom were trained in pediatric critical care medicine, the level of agreement for other providers who commonly treat sepsis (e.g., emergency physicians) may differ from our results. A second limitation is that criteria used for physician diagnosis were not standardized. Although this may have increased variability in physician diagnosis across providers and sites, such an approach reflects that physicians often differ in their diagnostic approach. Third, the higher proportion of patients with available laboratory measures in the consensus criteria only and both definition groups may itself have increased the likelihood of identification by consensus criteria because, in the absence of available data, these measures were assumed to be within normal limits. Although it is more likely that sicker patients had directed laboratory testing performed than unsuspected organ dysfunction was discovered through routine laboratory testing, differential availability of laboratory results may have been a source of misclassification bias. Finally, because a \u201cgold standard\u201d does not exist, it is not possible to determine the degree to which either definition correctly identified pediatric patients with severe sepsis or compared the sensitivity and specificity of the two definitions.",
