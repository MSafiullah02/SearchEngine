Overall, the 5.8% of enrolled patients developed persistent pancreatic islet autoimmunity, with single or multiple T1DM autoantibodies at seroconversion after 9 months from the respiratory infection. Autoantibodies were more commonly detected in patients with severe respiratory disease, although mild symptomatic infections were also associated with autoimmunity. Interestingly, coronaviruses were identified as one the different pathogens involved [7] . In 2018, a cohort study investigated the relationship between T1DM and both pandemic and seasonal influenza infections: although a clear association was not demonstrated, a twofold excess of incident T1DM was found among the 76,173 patients with pandemic H1N1 infection diagnosed by laboratory or specialist healthcare [8] .",

            "text": "Since SARS-Cov-2 infection has been declared by the World Health Organization as a global health emergency, several studies are ongoing worldwide to clarify pathogenic aspects and discover therapies. Similarly to the SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 infects both the upper and the lower respiratory tract cells, causing an aggressive inflammatory response induced by virus replicative cycle which hesitates in pulmonary cells' death. This phenomenon, along with viruses' emission from cells, induces a local immune response, with recruitment of macrophages/monocytes and lymphocytes and cytokines release.",
