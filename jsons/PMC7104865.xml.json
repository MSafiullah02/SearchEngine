Biological membranes consist of phospholipid bilayers with embedded integral and peripheral proteins that can rotate and translate laterally. Membranes may attain curvature as a consequence of asymmetry imposed by its own constituents, such as cholesterol, or by the presence of external molecules, such as proteins that can insert hydrophobic domains into one side of the bilayer with membrane-piercing \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}\u03b1-helices [7]. This type of helix can hook the opposite side of the membrane and produce a local constriction on membrane thickness or they may act as scaffolds for membrane curvature [1, 8, 9]. Moreover, domains of different lipids or clusters of proteins, as well as the boundaries of an open membrane, may produce lines of tension that introduce extra forces on the membrane [10, 11].",

These include local membrane bending [1] followed by virus budding and final membrane scission, in which the virion is detached from the cellular membrane [12]. Specifically, the dengue virus (DENV) [13, 14] is coated by replicas of two proteins, namely envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, forming 90 E-M heterotetramers (2 E  +  2 M) that cover a spherical phospholipid membrane. The E protein presents a soluble ectodomain (sE) and a transmembrane domain (TMD) that acts as an anchor. The M protein resides under the E protein shell, practically immersed in the virus membrane (figures 1(A) and (B)). The transmembrane domain of the E-M heterotetramer is subdivided into stem and anchor helices (figure 1(A)); the stem helices have a polar/nonpolar surface pattern and are all accommodated at one side of the bilayer surface, while the anchors, mostly hydrophobic, present polar residues only at their distal loops [14\u201316]. Theses loops connect two helices of the E protein (ET1; ET2) and two helices of the M protein (MT1; MT2).",

Here, we examine deformations induced on a host-like phospholipid bilayer [18] (see Methods section) in a progressive way, through three distinct oligomerization states of E-M proteins, namely: one (EM1), three (EM3), and fifteen (EM15) heterotetramers (figures 1(C)\u2013(E)). Essentially, this work concerns the description and analysis of the membrane bending and vesiculation mechanisms induced by the envelope proteins of the DENV. The EM15 system emulates a fragment of the DENV envelope: it is composed of an open membrane patch of 59  \u00d7  59 nm2 encrusted by 1/6 of the outer structural proteins of DENV immersed in solvent particles, amounting to the equivalent of three million atoms.",

We present in silico mutagenesis experiments that corroborate the notion that the membrane-bending forces are a consequence of the phospholipid rearrangement triggered by the relatively short length of the TMD of the E-M proteins. As more E-M heterotetramers are assembled in a symmetric setup, the resulting curvature in the planar phospholipid bilayer leads to a self-assembled vesicle, impelled by the accumulated mechanical stress imposed by the proteins and also by a line of tension along the membrane boundary.",

Open membrane patches were used for the larger EM15 system, and this was simulated with isotropic periodic boundary conditions.

For consistency with other literature all reported MD-times for CG simulations were multiplied by a factor of four to represent an estimate of real time [23], however with the caveat noted above that there is no time in CG simulations.

Initially, the TMD of the E-M proteins was aligned closely to the upper layer of a continuous membrane (figure 2(A); see also the Methods section); this configuration is thermodynamically unfavorable because the anchor helices, which are relatively short, have their polar loops in a hydrophobic environment (the middle portion of the membrane). Therefore, a prompt rearrangement of the lipids molecules and cholesterol molecules takes place, producing a local constriction on the membrane: the bottom layer is attracted by the polar tip of the anchor helices, pulling down the whole TMD, which gets embedded deeper into the membrane, pressuring the upper monolayer. Promptly, the E-M heterotetramer becomes attached to the membrane through the amphipathic EH1, EH2, and MH helices. Concomitantly, the lipid rearrangement leads to a number of polar phosphate groups from the bottom layer to move toward the polar helices\u2019 loops. After about 50 ns, the system is stabilized in a conformation that shows an upper planar layer and a bottom layer containing an indentation right below the TMD (figure 2(B)), which leads to a locally reduced thickness of the bilayer. This is in good agreement to the experimental observation made using cryo-electron microscopy that the membrane thickness is reduced by the transmembrane helices of E and M [14].",

The overall impact of such migration is a decrease of 16% in the total area occupied by all lipids and, as one would expect, a corresponding increase in 19% in lipid density in the whole vesicle.

(A) Structures of the EM heterotetramer (two E and two M) of DENV: domain I (DI, red), domain II (DII, yellow), and domain III (DIII, blue) are the three domains collectively called ectodomain of E. The TMD is composed of (i) stem: six helices (two sets each of EH1, EH2, and MH) partially embedded into the bilayer, and (ii) anchor: eight membrane-piercing helices (two sets each of ET1, ET2, MT1, and MT2). (B) Structural surface of DENV as crystallographically determined; note the fivefold axis at the center of the figure (blue circle-like spot). White lines highlight the three systems considered here, composed of one (EM1), three (EM3), and fifteen (EM15) EM heterotetramers. (C) EM1 system: one EM heterotetramer anchored in a flat continuous membrane connected with its images through the periodic boundary conditions. (D) The EM3 system corresponds to three EM1 shaped as an irregular rhombus also planted parallel into the flat \u2018continuous\u2019 membrane. (E) In turn, the EM15 system (shown in smaller scale here) consists of five groups of EM3, facing each other in a rotationally symmetric fashion, embedded into a flat open membrane patch of size 59  \u00d7  59 nm2. It reproduces a planar version of the cluster of fifteen EM heterotetramers around the fivefold axis of the icosahedral symmetry of the DENV.",

Note that the curvature determined by the protein-membrane interaction (on the top of the sphere) is smaller than the curvature determined by the rest of the membrane.
