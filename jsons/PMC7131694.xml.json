While about one-half of 6-month-old infants still have detectable levels of maternal antibodies to measles virus, none of the 12-month-olds show this. Among those without passive immunity to measles, only about one-third of the 6-month-olds mustered enough antibodies upon vaccination to resist an infection, compared with 100% of the 9- and 12-month-olds. Consequently, the human immune system continues to develop postnatally, acquiring key abilities past the age of 6 months. The development of the canine immune system shares many similarities with that of the human. In both species immune competence, also of the mucosal immune system, is fully developed before birth although further maturation of the responses may continue into the postnatal period (Felsburg, 2002).",

The lay public was activated, the foe included vets and the biologicals industry. In England (2004), a similar initiative of several newspapers based on information contained in a letter from more than 30 British vets, contained quotes like: \u201cunnecessary, potentially dangerous, fraud by misrepresentation, fraud by silence, theft by deception, complete overkill\u201d and the like. The scenario world-wide, including the medical scene is not different, and websites abound advertising pamphlets with titles like \u201cVaccination, Social Violence and Criminality\u201d, \u201cThe Hidden Truth\u201d, \u201cVaccines Represent a Medical Assault on the Immune System\u201d, \u201cWhat Doctors Don\u2019t Tell You\u201d, to quote a few.

The real and serious threat to veterinary medicine (and of course to the canine and feline populations) is the vaccination antagonism in the public with its aggressive undertones.

Protection against most viral diseases is indeed antibody-mediated, and antibodies are easily measured. In dogs these have been found to persist for more than 7 years, the study did not look later. The high prevalence of adequate antibody responses (CPV, 95.1%; CDV, 97.6%) in a large population (>1500 animals) \u201csuggests that annual revaccinations against CPV and CDV may not be necessary\u201d was the authors\u2019 conclusion (Twark and Dodds, 2000). In the cat, antibodies to FPV, FCV and FHV were detected for more than four years (Mouzin et al., 2004). The question whether the titers found are protective or not against a field virus challenge is irrelevant for this discussion. It is not the residual serum antibody that determines survival to challenge but the population of memory cells that can quickly expand. The question about the longevity of memory cells has now been answered experimentally; the question was not, if lifelong immunity exists (which is common knowledge), but whether its mechanism relies on a lifelong presence of the antigen in the animal's organism or of the cells\u2019 longevity. The latter was not found to be the case \u201cMemory B-cell persistence is independent of persisting immunising antigen\u201d; (Maruyama et al., 2000). However, it is not an individual memory B-cell, rather a population of slowly dividing clones that persists during the life of the organism. Like in neurobiology, a paradigm has been shattered: neurons and memory cells can indeed divide.",

Post-vaccinal serology, however, is not new to companion animal medicine: evidence of antibodies to rabies virus decides whether a dog may travel. An assessment of the animal's immune status would provide the vet with information about the success rate of her measures, and reassure the client. The proposal is to assess the result of vaccination by asking the question: did the vaccinee's immune system recognise the antigen? No assertion of protection, only a probability can be given \u2013 similar to the results of many assays in clinical chemistry. The first serum samples should be tested in the 3rd year of life, to see whether the pup vaccination (first year) plus boost (second year) have resulted in immunological memory; later tests can be done if so desired by the client, e.g. before the 3-yearly interval, as an aid in the decision about revaccination.",

Herd immunity is defined as the indirect protection of susceptible members of a population brought about by the presence of immune individuals. To prevent serious losses from epidemics (like during the distemper epidemic in Finland 1994\u20131995, where >5000 dogs were infected, of which \u223c30% succumbed; (Ek-Kommonen et al., 1997), active campaigning for vaccination should be targeted at achieving about 70% immune coverage. This figure has been obtained by mathematical modelling of epidemics and confirmed by observations from natural outbreaks (like the Finnish epidemic), but may not be universal, i.e. for all infectious agents. In such a situation, the effective reproduction rate R would be reduced to <1, which means that there will be less than one new case per infected individual, and (if R continues to be <1) the infection will locally die out. These considerations play a role in the eradication strategy for measles. Distemper cannot be eradicated because of spill-over infections from feral carnivore reservoirs and re-introduction of the agent into the domestic populations, but the spread of infection can be contained.",
