Although influenza is usually the pathogen that captures the attention of the world, other respiratory pathogens have recently garnered the attention of the military. Adenoviruses cause a wide array of symptoms, from conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and mild respiratory infections to lifethreatening pneumonias in young adults and blood stream and brain infections in immunocompromised hosts. Enterovirus 68 has recently shown severe respiratory illness in other countries such as the Philippines, the Netherlands, and Japan [13, 19] , and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in the Middle East [33, 34] along with the H7N9 influenza outbreak in China [39] has put focus on new and emerging pathogens that may be introduced into immunologically na\u00efve populations or recombined into novel forms through human-human or human-animal transmission.",

In addition, sequencing will allow for rapid sequencing of viral genomes and provides an opportunity to gain insight into viral genetic drift (single nucleotide polymorphism), emergence of new strains such as SARS-like coronavirus or MERS-CoV, and transmission. To date, a limited number of pathogenic viral studies have been done with the MinION, and all of the published results have focused on sequencing DNA rather than RNA, which is the focus of this effort [20] . Metagenomic NGS is particularly attractive for surveillance of febrile illness because the approach can broadly detect viruses, bacteria, and parasites in clinical samples [7, 11] .",

Such data can assist in vaccine development, detection of anti-viral drug resistance, or the identification of new emerging reassorted viral genomes. These advances may help to mitigate the morbidity and mortality of influenza pandemics or seasonal viral epidemics. NGS platforms such as the Illumina MiSeq and Life Technologies Ion Torrent have been extensively used to provide WGS data for viruses, potentially within 2-3 days of the receipt of a sample [36] . Furthermore, although the cost of NGS is decreasing, however it is still cost prohibitive unless large numbers of samples are processed in a multiplexing format. Therefore, there is clearly a place for a portable NGS instrument that can be deployed into the field for surveillance using available field ready kits and sequencing reagents that are comparable to cost of benchtop sequencer. Analysis of sequencing data is accomplished in real time by an internet-connected laptop. Another unique feature of the MinION is its ability to generate very long reads of up to 60 kilobases (kb) [28] . The MinION has been successfully used for WGS and targeted sequencing [8, 20, 38] .",

The base-calling analysis for the MinION nanopore sequencer is an area of active development, as well as flow cell configurations, protocols for kits, and associated kit chemistries. The best quality sequence data are termed 2D reads, while 1D reads are from the template strand. Although the accuracy of MinION sequence data is an area of active development, with recent development of a new nanopore for the flow cells, one should expect increased data quality with each increment in flow cell configuration. Data quality has improved and was demonstrated in this study with each improvement in kit chemistry and flow cell type. This study shows that the platform can be applied for rapid microbial detection with 3-hour run time, which provides sufficient data to generate a reliable identification. As sequencing yield, quality, and turnaround times continue to improve, it is anticipated that nanopore sequencing will challenge mainstays such as PCR for identification of unknown samples. Amplicon and rapid WGS was successfully utilized as an approach for pathogen detection. Low titer viral nasal wash samples were was positively identified after WGA even when samples had high human read counts due to a carry-over human NA contribution.

In this study, metagenomic sequencing of organisms in clinical samples were successful with increased sequencing depth when WGS was used over that of amplicon sequencing which is beneficial for studying viral genetic rearrangement. In addition, these data also support the utilization of amplicon sequencing over deep sequencing for field applications where surveillance is needed.",

The library preparation utilizes a transposase to fragment the DNA. Analysis in this study was limited in scope but demonstrates it is functionally a game changer when time is of importance in identifying pathogens in acute infections or during surveillance. This approach is especially beneficial when identification is difficult using conventional bacterial culture techniques and in some cases where organisms are difficult to grow in cultures. Establishing a system for rapid microorganism identification via metagenomic sequencing seems pertinent, especially for field applications.",

Throughout this study, it has been demonstrated that a low number of long reads are sufficient for accurate identification of small genomes. Table 2 and 3).
