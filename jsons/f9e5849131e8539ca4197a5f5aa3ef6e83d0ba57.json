The disease was very similar to childhood-onset Still's disease, today called systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA), described a century ago by Sir Still [1] . Although the exact pathogenic mechanisms of the disease remain unknown, substantial advances have been made first to confirm the homology between AoSD and SoJIA, and then the disease became the archetype of nonfamilial, or sporadic, systemic autoinflammatory disorders (SAID) [2] [3] [4] .",

In the latter, a disease-free interval between the childhood episode and the adulthood recurrence differentiates AoSD from persistent SoJIA. In most patients, AoSD is characterized by four cardinal symptoms: spiking fever, an evanescent salmon-pink maculopapular rash, arthritis, and a white blood cell count (WBC) \u226510,000/mm 3 , mainly neutrophilic polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). Other features are sore throat or pharyngitis, myalgia, lymph node or spleen enlargement, pleuritis or pericarditis, multivisceral involvement, elevated levels of liver enzymes, and other hematologic abnormalities [3, 7, 8] . None of these symptoms is disease specific, so diagnosis of AoSD is difficult, and clinicians must first rule out neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory conditions.",

The disease occurs worldwide, and no specific familial aggregation has been reported. AoSD satisfies the definition of an orphan disease because historically its prevalence was estimated between one case per million in Europe [9] and ten cases per million in Japan [10] . In the Japanese study, the incidence was estimated at about one case per million in the mid-1990s. However, because of the substantial advances in AoSD diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses during the last two decades, these prevalence and incidence estimates lack robustness, and new studies are clearly needed to update these figures. Initially, the disease was characterized as affecting exclusively young adults (i.e., 16-35 years of age [1] ); however, more recent series identified cases in adults older than 35 and even elderly people [5, [11] [12] [13] [14] . The sex ratio is almost balanced, with only a slight female predominance [5, 6, 11, [13] [14] [15] ].",

Presence of purpuric lesions should lead to urgent coagulation workup because these lesions are suggestive of the AoSD hematologic complications of hemophagocytic syndrome or reactive hemophagocytic lymphoproliferation (RHL), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), also called thrombocytic thrombocytopenic purpura or Moschcowitz syndrome [3, 7] .",

The GF level normally represents more than half of the total ferritin level. In inflammatory conditions, the concentration of GF decreases and usually ranges from 20% to 50%; this decrease has been related to the saturation of glycosylation mechanisms due to hyperferritinemia. However, in AoSD, GF level is typically markedly decreased (below 20%), which suggests a more specific phenomenon. More extensive data revealed a sensitivity and specificity of GF \u226420% for AoSD diagnosis of 78% and 64%, respectively [27] . The combination of both hyperferritinemia and GF level \u226420% yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 84%, respectively. Of note, although serum ferritin level fluctuates according to systemic inflammation, GF level remains low several weeks to several months after disease remission [30] . However, as mentioned previously, low GF level is not completely specific to AoSD and is observed in other inflammatory processes, such as severe systemic infections [27] . Moreover, the GF level is usually low, \u226420%, in hemophagocytic syndromes, regardless of the cause, such as infection, neoplasm, or inflammation [31] [32] [33] .",

Autoimmunity referred to adaptive immunity and was defined as aberrant dendritic, B-and T-cell responses in primary and secondary lymphoid organs leading to tolerance break and development of immune reactivity toward native antigens (with autoantibodies in most cases), whereas autoinflammation referred to innate immunity and was defined as dysregulated activation of macrophages and neutrophils in response to a danger signal leading to tissue damage. These categories represent a continuum, which allowed for a new classification of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders that was refined in the following years [2, 4] . Although autoimmune diseases were rather easily diagnosed based on autoantibody or autoantigen-specific T and B cells, no specific biomarker exists for SAID. The definition mainly relies on similarities with monogenic, hereditary periodic fever syndromes, which were at the origin of the concept. They include several key features: intense inflammation with periodic fever, tissue inflammation depending on the disease, increased leukocyte and neutrophil count, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and, more recently, a pathogenic role of inflammasome and response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade [35] . Besides monogenic familial syndromes, Crohn's disease was the first nonfamilial polygenic AID, mainly tissue specific, with predominant gut involvement [36, 37] . A few years later, Still's disease was described as another nonfamilial AID, becoming one of the most characteristic polygenic systemic SAID [3] .",

Danger signals are transmitted to macrophages and neutrophils via specific Toll-like receptors that activate specific inflammasomes, likely NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), leading to caspase activation and overproduction of active IL-1 [39] [40] [41] [42] . This step seems to be central to the AoSD pathogenesis and leads to intense innate immune cell activation and overproduction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as well as IL-8 and IL-17. Several factors actively contribute to an amplified inflammatory response, often referred to as the cytokine \"burst\" or \"storm\" [3, 42] . In addition to IL-1 itself, conferring retrograde activation of macrophages and neutrophils; different alarmins, such as the S100 protein-S100A12 protein seeming to be more specific to Still's disease in children-and advanced glycosylated end (AGE) products are involved in these processes [39, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Besides amplification mechanisms, SAID pathogenesis has been suggested to involve deficiency or failure in regulatory or antiinflammatory mechanisms: deficiency in T regulator or natural killer cells, insufficient IL-10 production, and deficiency in resolution lipid mediators, soluble receptors of AGEs (RAGEs), or other resolution-associated molecular patterns [47] [48] [49] [50] . [3, 7, 39] . In addition, patients often experience odynophagia or pharyngitis just before the start of the disease or the relapse, which could correspond to the infectious danger signal that will trigger Toll-like receptors and start the intense inflammatory process.",

The disease is present in different geographic regions and different ethnic groups [3, 4, 7, 39, 51] . Association studies have suggested a potential predisposing genetic background. HLA-Bw35 was the first identified as a susceptibility antigen and associated with a mild self-limiting pattern of the disease [52] . HLA-DR4 was found more prevalent in AoSD cases versus healthy controls, and HLA-DRw6 was associated with the occurrence of proximal arthralgia [53] . However, no functional analysis has confirmed these hypotheses [3, 39, 53] . Recently, two major findings have been reported in SoJIA patients. Firstly, a homoallelic missense mutation in the enzyme laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase) domain-containing 1-LACC1-has been identified in 13 SoJIA patients from five Saudi consanguineous families [54] . Although familial SoJIA is not the rule, this study raises the potential role of this laccase in the pathogenesis of SoJIA. Secondly, a large association study performed in 982 SoJIA children and 8010 healthy controls identified a strong association between SoJIA and different HLA-DRB1 * 11 haplotypes which all contain glutamate 58 [55] . This finding is more challenging since it would involve adaptive immunity in the AoSD pathogenesis which was not expected [56] .",

Key diagnostic tests display thrombocytopenia by platelet consumption, anemia, and schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells), which are specific to this diagnosis.

PAH, either idiopathic or occurring with AoSD or other connective tissue diseases, is thought to be related at least in part to immune-related alteration of the endothelium with overproduction of IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF [79, 80, 82, 83, 99] . PAH may occur at AoSD onset or later and seems to predominate in women. The diagnosis must be suspected with unexplained and often rapidly progressing dyspnea [59, 79, 81, 100, 101] . Electrocardiography is rarely contributive, eventually disclosing signs of right atrium hypertrophy. Echocardiography is more useful for detection by measuring systolic pulmonary artery pressure, which is >35 mmHg, and the exclusion of left ventricle dysfunction. The formal PAH diagnosis remains the right heart catheterization [100, 101].",

For patients with mainly chronic arthritis, the distinction between seronegative RA and AoSD can be difficult. Besides autoimmune diseases, hereditary or nonfamilial autoinflammatory syndrome (AIS) can present with symptoms close to AoSD because of the combination of fever, skin lesions, and arthritis in addition to other symptoms that differ among the AIS [106] [107] [108] . Although the hereditary AIS often begins during childhood, the diagnosis tends to be made when the individual is an adult; examples are hyperimmunoglobulin D (IgD) syndrome or TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). Different mutations have been associated with different hereditary AIS, but, to date, none has been associated with AoSD. However, the similarities between these diseases and AoSD might suggest common pathogenic pathways and place AoSD as a nonfamilial, sporadic form of AIS.",

However, it took surprisingly long until clinical development moved forward from cohort studies to randomized, placebocontrolled trials. Currently, two IL-1 blocking compounds are the focus of phase 2/ phase 3 studies with different designs. Anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, was the first biologic showing beneficial effects in treating the systemic and articular features of AoSD in many case series, uncontrolled trials, and different national surveys. Although the evidence for its efficacy has not been proven by controlled trials, the overall number of more than 250 published cases provides convincing results. In fact, a clear and sustained improvement was described for systemic and also arthritic symptoms in most treated cases [68, [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] . Systemic features seem to show a more rapid response, and longer exposure seems usually required for improvement of arthritis. Of major importance for long-term safety were consistent reports of a reduction or even discontinuation of glucocorticoids use as well as NSAIDs. In this context, meta-analyses from eight case series and three national surveys meeting predefined quality standards and including more than 100 anakinra-treated AoSD patients revealed a remission rate of approximately 80% and a reduced use of steroids in approximately 35% of patients [69] . Recently, a large observational retrospective multicenter study from Italy added evidence for a strong impact on disease activity with the Pouchot score as well as clinical and serological features regardless of sex, age, disease pattern, or co-medication [46] . Since September 2017, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 study in the United States has recruited patients for investigating two different doses of anakinra (2 mg/kg/day [max 100 mg/day] or 4 mg/kg/day [max 200 mg/day]) to evaluate its efficacy and safety in patients newly diagnosed with SoJIA and AoSD. The primary end point, American College of Rheumatology 30 (ACR30) response, has already been evaluated at week 2; however, the overall treatment period is short, with only 12 weeks of exposure followed by a 4-week safety follow-up [167] . Of note, anakinra is the only IL-1 blocker for which we have substantial long-term results in terms of efficacy and safety in AoSD [144] , and it has now been approved in this indication. In contrast to monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, in AoSD, remission can continue in some cases even after treatment is stopped. However, a relatively high withdrawal rate of 40% has been reported owing to loss of response over time and also to frequent injection site reactions to the required daily administrations.",

Furthermore, canakinumab is also approved for treating other autoinflammatory diseases including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, familial Mediterranean fever, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome, and hyper-IgD syndrome as well as SoJIA. Although the overall experience with canakinumab in AoSD is still limited, the reported response of systemic features and arthritis was rapid and sustained over many months to years in most patients, frequently allowing for tapering of steroids [145] [146] [147] . Of note, canakinumab was found highly effective for patients with AoSD who were difficult to treat, including those showing failure of NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and other IL-1 inhibitors. With these promising results, a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, phase 2 study of canakinumab in AoSD is ongoing [168] . The dosage of canakinumab with monthly injections of up to 4 mg/kg body weight (maximum dos of 150 mg) is based on the pharmacokinetic profile in adolescent patients with SoJIA. The primary aim is to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in patients with AoSD and active joint involvement in terms of the proportion of patients with a clinically significant reduction in disease activity (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28] > 1.2) following a treatment period of 12 weeks. The overall placebocontrolled period is 24 weeks, but nonresponders can be unblinded and show treatment rescue at week 12. The core study is followed by an optional long-term extension over 2 years to provide additional safety results in the adult population.",

None of these mechanisms has been investigated in AoSD in a controlled setting of clinical trials in detail. For the two different IL-6 receptor antagonists currently available in daily practice for treating rheumatic diseases, only the tocilizumab AoSD case series has been published and reported at conferences [155] [156] [157] [158] . To summarize, the observed anti-inflammatory effects were strong, rapid, and sustained for most of the cases. Usually, the systemic features disappeared entirely, but also the arthritic manifestations improved, and the serologic activity decreased [159, 160] . However, because of limited data, the likelihood of response cannot be estimated as clearly as for IL-1 inhibitors and seems to be between 60% to 80% in terms of full remission. A recently published meta-analysis of ten original studies (147 individuals) on the efficacy of tocilizumab and AoSD revealed overall high partial and complete remission rates of 85-77%, respectively. Tocilizumab prevented new flares, was well tolerated, and could significantly reduce the need for corticosteroids [161, 162] .",
