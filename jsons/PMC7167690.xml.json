            "text": "The routine production of inexpensive vaccines in plants has for nearly two decades been an idealistic and largely unrealised dream. The romantic notion of \u2018cheap, edible vaccines\u2019 of the early years [see (Fooks, 2000; Giddings et al., 2000; Rybicki, 2009a)] has not been realised, and indeed, may never be. While the idea of using edible plants or fruits to deliver vaccines is still very attractive\u2014largely because it means that vaccines could be \u2018pharmed\u2019 where they are needed, obviating transport and cold chains, and because oral delivery is seen as being easier and safer than injection\u2014there are simply too many practical and potentially ethical problems with the concept for it to be implemented as envisioned. In the first place, quality control issues would largely preclude on\u2010site production of a vaccine in a food plant: unless every single plant or even every dosage portion of an engineered food was to be assayed for vaccine content, for example, it would be impossible to guarantee that there would be enough of a dose of vaccine for efficacy\u2014or that the plants were even still producing vaccine, or enough of it. Second, the physical administration of such vaccines needs to be regulated, as otherwise too much or too little could be given, and too frequently: the latter prospect especially raises the spectre of immune tolerance to the chosen antigen being elicited, which would negate the whole raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the vaccine. Thus, the way the field is now developing recognises that even though oral dosing is still a desirable feature, the product itself will have to be processed to some extent, formulated in a reproducible way, and given under supervision so as to ensure reproducible effects.",

While many plant models have been tried, there are now a relatively limited number of proven systems relevant for industrial\u2010scale production of vaccines. Expression systems include stable transgenic or transplastomic plants or plant cell lines, with inducible or constitutive expression, seed\u2010specific expression, and plant virus\u2010based and Agrobacterium tumefaciens\u2010based transient expression systems. There are now registered products, produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) protocols, entering clinical trials. There are presently several independent facilities capable of manufacturing clinical\u2010grade material for human trial; products have been in, and there are present and planned, clinical trials. Candidate vaccines have been produced for human and animal viruses and bacteria and other parasites; for allergens; and as cancer therapeutics. This review will accordingly summarise some important historical developments in the field, as well as covering future prospects, and discuss aspects of vaccine antigen production relevant to plant biotechnologists.",

One early and notable success was the protection of mice against challenge with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) after immunisation either via oral or parenteral routes with leaf or leaf homogenates of transgenic alfalfa expressing the structural protein VP1 of FMDV (Wigdorovitz et al., 1999a). Mice fed on transgenic alfalfa expressing a highly immunogenic epitope from FMDV fused to the glucuronidase (gus A) reporter gene were protected from experimental challenge (Dus Santos et al., 2002); mice could be protected against a lethal dose of rabies virus after being fed with transgenic spinach (Modelska et al., 1998); HBsAg produced in both transgenic lupins and lettuce elicited specific antibodies in mice and humans, respectively (Kapusta et al., 1999); sunflower seed albumin produced in lupin has been tested as an anti\u2010allergen vaccine (Smart et al., 2003); the small surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (S\u2010HBsAg) has been produced in transgenic yellow lupin calli or tumours (Pniewski et al., 2006). The most notable achievement for this sort of expression for human vaccines, however, was probably the demonstration that measles virus haemagglutinin (MV\u2010H) protein could successfully expressed in transgenic lettuce and was immunogenic in mice (Webster et al., 2006): this followed other work from this group demonstrating first, that plant\u2010derived MV\u2010H induced neutralising antibodies in mice (Huang et al., 2001); and second, that DNA\u2010mediated measles immunisation could be successfully boosted with an oral plant\u2010derived measles virus vaccine (Webster et al., 2002).",

Maize or corn seed has been especially popular, because of both the high potential yield of material and the very well\u2010established milling/processing technology and a number of viral and bacterial antigens and antibodies have been successfully produced. Chikwamba et al. (Chikwamba et al., 2002), for example, demonstrated that E. coli LT\u2010B toxin subunit assembled correctly, was functional, and protected orally\u2010immunised mice against bacterial challenge. Indeed, ProdiGene Inc. (TX, USA) built a business portfolio around successful expression of various vaccine and other proteins in maize seed (Lamphear et al., 2002; Horn et al., 2003; Streatfield et al., 2003) and were able to show that maize seed containing a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) subunit vaccine was an effective booster vaccine for systemic and mucosal immunity in pigs (Lamphear et al., 2004).",

One recent and innovative finding was that feeding mice rice seed\u2010expressed Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 allergen proteins of Japanese cedar reduced allergen\u2010specific IgE, T\u2010cell proliferative reaction and histamine responses (Hiroi and Takaiwa, 2006): this vaccine has been improved to include further T\u2010cell epitopes and will be trialled in humans (Takaiwa, 2007).

More recently, an antigen protective against the roundworm Ascaris suum (s16) produced as a fusion chimaera with cholera toxin (CT) B subunit (CTB) elicited an As16\u2010specific serum antibody response when orally administered to mice in combination with CT and resulted in a lower lung worm burden after challenge than in control mice (Matsumoto et al., 2009).",

In the triggering incident in 2002, soya bean and maize harvests in two states in the USA were contaminated with transgenic volunteer maize plant seeds expressing TGEV capsid protein: the company was fined and forced to clean up the seed by the US Department of Agriculture. However, a subsequent similar incident in 2004, where volunteer transgenic maize contaminated an oat crop, which was harvested and baled for use as on\u2010farm animal feed, and was also found growing and flowering in a nearby sorghum field, led to an agreement that the company and its successors would never again apply for a notification or permit to introduce transgenic plants (APHIS, 2008).",

Paradoxically, perhaps the most successful use of an engineered potato as a vaccine\u2014the demonstration in 2005 that HBsAg\u2010producing potatoes could be used as a booster vaccine in humans (Thanavala et al., 2005)\u2014was also possibly one of the last times this would be carried out.

However, it was the use of tobacco, which led to many of the early proofs of concept and of principle. Thus, the first proof of concept for production of a vaccine\u2010relevant protein in plants was published exactly 20 years ago: Hiatt et al. (Hiatt et al., 1989) described the successful production of a mouse hybridoma\u2010derived monoclonal antibody (mAb) in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The first vaccine protein to be produced in any plants was the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), just 3 years later: Hugh Mason et al. in Charles W Arntzen\u2019s group demonstrated that transgenic tobacco containing the relevant gene under the control of a constitutive promoter produced HBsAg that could, moreover, assemble in planta into the characteristic 22\u2010nm particles first described from the blood of HBV\u2010infected people, and which constitute the basis of the commercial recombinant vaccines Recombivax HB and Engerix B, licenced in 1986 and 1989, respectively (Mason et al., 1992).",

Indeed, a recent review touts the technology as useful in terms of combating bioterrorism, given the high yields obtainable (Streatfield, 2006). Singh et al. (Singh et al., 2009) have recently reviewed protocols for transformation, expression and oral administration; the group of Henry Daniell in particular has pioneered much in this regard (Daniell, 2006; Dhingra and Daniell, 2006). An early demonstration from this group of the potential of chloroplast expression was the production in tobacco of viable E. coli LT\u2010B and Cholera vibrio CT\u2010B antigens (Daniell et al., 2001): at the time they made the point, repeated frequently since, that even very high\u2010level recombinant protein expression by chloroplasts often does not seem to affect plant phenotype as much as nuclear\u2010mediated expression. The high\u2010level expression of Clostridium tetanii toxin Fragment C followed (Tregoning et al., 2003); so too demonstrations of the production and efficacy of chloroplast\u2010produced Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) protective antigen (PA) (Watson et al., 2004; Aziz et al., 2005; Koya et al., 2005).",

It is interesting that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) spike protein\u2014a membrane\u2010associated glycoprotein\u2014apparently accumulates well in transformed chloroplasts (Li et al., 2006). Another recent development was the demonstration of the high\u2010level production in tobacco chloroplasts and very effective immunogenicity of the LacA lectin fragment of the eukaryote protist pathogen Entamoeba histolytica, which causes \u223c100 000 deaths annually: subcutaneous immunisation of mice produced high IgG titres, and\u2014in the words of the authors\u2014\u2018An average yield of 24 mg of LecA per plant should produce 29 million doses of vaccine antigen per acre of transgenic plants\u2019 (Chebolu and Daniell, 2007). Other recent successes include the highest expression level yet achieved (\u223c3 g/kg) for HPV\u201016 L1 protein in transplastomic tobacco, which both assembled correctly and elicited neutralising antibodies (Fernandez\u2010San Millan et al., 2008), despite another claim that HPV\u201016 L1 expressed well in chloroplasts only when fused to a chloroplast protein fragment (Lenzi et al., 2008). The HIV\u20101 Pr55Gag protein has also been successfully produced at relatively high levels in transplastomic tobacco (to \u223c360 mg/kg) and assembled into VLPs similar to those produced in animal cells, which makes this the first vaccine\u2010relevant HIV antigen to be produced in reasonable quantities in plants (Scotti et al., 2009).",

Indeed, one of the first plant\u2010based vaccines described was recombinant TMV with malarial epitopes exposed on virion surfaces (Turpen et al., 1995). Biosource Technologies, which later became Large Scale Biology Corp. (Vacaville, CA, USA), had the recombinant TMV technology (Geneware\u2122) as one of their main products, and it was successfully used to express their flagship patient\u2010specific non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma tumour\u2010derived single\u2010chain Fv epitope vaccines for FDA\u2010approved clinical trial (1999, 2003, 2006, 2008). A significant proof of principle in an animal model was the successful use of rTMV expressing surface\u2010located epitopes derived from cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) and rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV) L2 minor capsid proteins as a protective injectable vaccine (Palmer et al., 2006). Our group also showed that CRPV major capsid protein L1 produced either via transgenesis or via rTMV expression, protected rabbits against CRPV challenge (Kohl et al., 2006). Significant findings for animal vaccines were the demonstrations of protection against lethal FMDV infection in mice immunised by injection of foliar extracts of N. benthamiana infected with rTMV expressing the whole FMDV VP1 (Wigdorovitz et al., 1999b) and passive immunisation via maternal antibodies of mouse pups born to dams immunised with purified VP8* fragment of the VP4 protein from bovine rotavirus (BRV) produced similarly in N. benthamiana (Perez Filgueira et al., 2004). Our group was able to improve the previously very poor expression levels of HPV\u201016 L1 capsid protein in transgenic N. tabacum (Varsani et al., 2003) by 10\u2010fold in N. benthamiana by use of Geneware\u2122 TMV (Varsani et al., 2006): however, expression levels at \u223c40 \u03bcg/kg were still well below what was achieved later. The possible uses of TMV\u2010based expression and/or presentation are also described in a recent review (McCormick and Palmer, 2008).",

Indeed, in many cases yields have been very low, especially in transgenic plants, and proofs of efficacy have suffered as a result. This is of concern for oral vaccination schemes, as experiments have shown that orders of magnitude more protein is required via oral intake than parenterally for the same level of immune response to the same protein, even with the use of potent adjuvants. The landmark 2005 potato\u2010produced HBsAg human clinical trial (Thanavala et al., 2005) is a case in point: while parenteral vaccination requires only 40 \u03bcg of HBsAg, oral boosting with three 100\u2010g doses of potato containing HBsAg doses of around 1 mg was only partially effective. It is worth noting that much higher levels of HBsAg expression have since been obtained (Huang et al., 2008), which may yet make the dream of an oral HBV vaccine a reality. In a direct comparison of oral vs. parenteral dosing with the same HPV vaccine, it was determined that 10 \u03bcg/dose of insect cell\u2010produced HPV VLPs with adjuvant were required to orally immunise mice for the same response elicited by injection of 1 \u03bcg (Rose et al., 1999; Gerber et al., 2001). Others have shown that oral administration of crude extracts of L1\u2010expressing insect cells could induce neutralising antibodies and L1\u2010specific cytotoxic T\u2010lymphocytes, indicating that similar plant preparations might work\u2014especially since yields of between 1\u20133 g/kg have been obtained.",

Simply changing host from N tabacum cv. Xanthi to SR1 allowed a 100\u2010fold increase in expression of the native viral gene (A Varsani, J Maclean, EP Rybicki, unpublished), to \u223c0.5 mg/kg. Via agroinfiltration work, we reiterated a surprising earlier finding that a human codon\u2010use optimised gene worked best (Biemelt et al., 2003) and a plant codon\u2010optimised version least well, compared to the native gene sequence, despite using completely different optimisations than the other group. The removal of 24 amino acids at the C\u2010terminus of L1\u2014which dramatically improves expression in yeast and insect cells\u2014had a negative effect in agroinfiltrated plants. We also showed that chloroplast export allowed significantly greater protein accumulation than cytoplasmic and that subsequent generation of transgenic SR1 tobacco with the relevant constructs reiterated the cytoplasmic vs. chloroplast accumulation differences and increased by a factor of \u223c20\u2010fold the previous best transgenic HPV\u201016 L1 yield, to around 500 mg/kg. However, this was achieved only in the T1 generation of plants regenerated from transformed callus: expression in all subsequent generations was either much lower or completely absent (J Maclean, M Koekemoer, EP Rybicki, unpublished). This points up another problem with attempts to maximise constitutive nuclear gene transgenic expression: the fact that gene silencing may occur! Thus, while high\u2010level HPV\u201016 L1 protein has been achieved in plants, to levels that could allow oral vaccines to be made, it appears that this will be from agroinfiltrated plants or transplastomic plants rather than from stably transformed conventional transgenics.",

While the \u2018conventional\u2019 developers of HIV vaccines are utilising multi\u2010antigen approaches and focussing on whole Gag and Env proteins in particular, it seems that no one has successfully expressed whole HIV Env gp160 protein or even the majority of the protein, in plants at reasonable yield\u2014although expression of a SIV gp130 was reported in maize seed (Horn et al., 2003). It has been speculated that this may be because of the misdirection of the new protein into the calreticulin pathway; however, there is no hard evidence for this (J. Ma, pers. commun.). It also appears to be very difficult to express more than portions of Gag in plants via stable or transient nuclear transformation, at reasonable yield (Meyers et al., 2008). While Tat protein has been produced at quite high yields in spinach and tomato (Karasev et al., 2005; Ramirez et al., 2007), and Gag\u2010derived p24 capsid protein in tobacco and Arabidopsis (Zhang et al., 2002; Obregon et al., 2006; Lindh et al., 2008), these proteins are not serious vaccine candidates in the global HIV vaccine hunt. It is most heartening, therefore, that Scotti et al. (Scotti et al., 2009) have recently reported that it is possible to produce whole Pr55Gag protein, at levels up to 800 mg/kg, in transplastomic tobacco. The fact that the protein assembled into VLPs like those produced in animal cell systems, and which are increasingly seen as potential HIV vaccines (Speth et al., 2008; Chege et al., 2009), means that a viable plant\u2010derived T\u2010cell stimulating HIV vaccine may finally be possible\u2014and could even be orally administered, given the kinds of yield that were demonstrated.",

Here, the effects of expression of two versions of a HIV\u20101 gag gene\u2010derived construct by agroinfiltration in N. benthamiana using a range of vectors targeting proteins to the cytoplasm, the ER and the chloroplasts can be seen. These 3\u2032\u2010terminal truncated gag genes encode a \u2018p41\u2019 matrix (MA, p17) and capsid (CA, p24) protein fusion, with and without (G2A) a p17 N\u2010terminal myristylation signal: myristic acid addition allows association of the Pr55Gag precursor protein (and presumably p41) with the cell membrane and subsequent budding of a VLP. While only the myristylated version buds, there is no difference in total accumulation of either version of Pr55Gag in insect cells (Halsey et al., 2008). In this case, while native p41 accumulated significantly better in chloroplasts than cytoplasm or ER, changing a single amino acid and cancelling myristylation very significantly reduced accumulation of G2A\u2010p41, especially in chloroplasts (Meyers et al., 2008). Thus, expression of the same protein in insect and animal cells is very different: I have mentioned previously that nuclear expression of whole Pr55Gag in plants is very low indeed, whatever the targeting; this contrasts with insect cell expression of the same protein in our hands, which gives reasonable yields (Jaffray et al., 2004; Halsey et al., 2008).

While many groups have experimented with expressing antigens from human pathogens in plants, it is people working with animal models and animal pathogens who have been able to demonstrate the most convincing proofs of efficacy for plant\u2010produced vaccines in general and for both oral and injectable versions. Among the leaders in this area\u2014possibly because of their working with several versions of the same vaccines, produced via different platforms\u2014is the group at the Instituto de Virologia in Buenos Aires [see review (Dus Santos and Wigdorovitz, 2005)]. While they have worked extensively on plant\u2010produced FMDV vaccines and shown efficacy in all cases (1999a, 1999b; Dus Santos et al., 2002), they have also recently been able to produce a partially purified bovine viral diarrhoea virus E2 glycoprotein subunit vaccine from transgenic alfalfa, which injected in equivalent amounts (two doses of 1.5 \u03bcg of antigen) protected cattle better than the conventional vaccine [reported in (Rybicki, 2009b)]. It is quite possible that the first targets of large\u2010scale production of plant\u2010derived vaccines should be diseases of animals, given the easier route to demonstration of efficacy, and the potentially far shorter regulatory path for such vaccines\u2014as has been demonstrated by Dow with their NDV vaccine (Dow AgroSciences, 2008).",

            "text": "The prospects for human vaccines are not as clear: while there has been much activity in producing alternatives to established vaccines\u2014such as those to HBV and HPV and rotaviruses, for example\u2014the simple fact is that there is either already enormous established conventional capacity for production of generics, as in the case of HBV, which is now cheap enough to be included in the Extended Programme on Immunisation (EPI) universal infant vaccination bundle or so much capital involved in development and production plants for the new HPV and rotavirus vaccines, for Big Pharma to have no interest in diversifying their means of production. As pointed out elsewhere, even reduction of cost of material and production plant to negligible amounts would only lower the cost of a plant\u2010produced biosimilar or generic version of an established vaccine by a fraction (32%) of the retail price, all other costs (including downstream processing) remaining the same (Rybicki, 2009a). Thus, it is probably not an option to attempt to compete with established products, but to use the unique advantage of the technology\u2014that is, the huge range in scalability and speed of response\u2014to leverage a niche in \u2018orphan\u2019 vaccines or emerging disease vaccines or even bioterror threats, where other means of production are simply too slow to respond. It is worth stressing the point made by Charles Arntzen and reported elsewhere (Rybicki, 2009b) that \u2018The plant advantage over older technologies [is] speed to new production and platform flexibility in terms of several ways to produce antigen\u2019. In this regard, the deconstructed viral vectors and even simple agroinfiltration are extremely potent tools for both pilot production and for scaling to full\u2010scale production, in rapid\u2010response scenarios.",

            "text": "Indeed, in this time of the new influenza A H1N1 pandemic, possibly the most impressive demonstration of the potential of plant\u2010produced vaccines is the fact that two groups of researchers\u2014at Medicago Inc. in Canada and at the Fraunhofer USA\u2014very recently managed to go from PubMed\u2010accessed H1 HA sequence, through to purification of grams of protein in less than a month, via transient expression in tobacco (Rybicki, 2009b). This is almost certainly the fastest production ever for any current pandemic or even seasonal influenza vaccine and represents a thorough vindication of the approach. The influenza pandemic response potential of the technology is explored elsewhere in this volume (D\u2019Aoust et al., 2010). The subject of new technologies for influenza seasonal and pandemic vaccines, and in particular the use of plants, has been well and comprehensively reviewed recently (Chichester et al., 2009a); suffice it to say here that there is ample evidence that plants may be a very viable vehicle for rapid\u2010response or even conventional vaccine production for the prevention of influenza. The recent demonstration of the ability of VAXX Inc. to quickly produce gram quantities of a diarrhoea\u2010causing norovirus subunit vaccine (Dylewski, 2009) is also very promising, given that this virus too is subject to rapid mutational change.",

There are now many proofs of concept and several of efficacy for oral immunisation in animal models\u2014and the recent demonstrations that very high yields of human vaccine candidates can be obtained via plastid transformation or transient expression in plants makes the dream of \u2018heat\u2010stable oral vaccines\u2019 [Charles Arntzen, quoted in (Rybicki, 2009a)] suddenly almost reachable. For example, while it may be true that 10\u201330\u00d7 as much antigen is needed via the oral route as is required parenterally for the same immune response, if this much antigen can be reliably provided by one tobacco plant and can be suitably and cheaply purified by a simple process, then it becomes eminently possible to exploit the technology for the original goal.",

In fact, the insistence among many in this research field that oral administration is needed for mucosal immunity may need to rethink their assumptions: in a landmark 1998 article, the following quote may give pause for thought. \u2018Based on these observations [comparisons of mucosal and parenteral vaccination with conventional vaccines], it is suggested that development of serum immunological responses are effective in the prevention of systemic disease regardless of the types of vaccines or route of their administration. However, induction of pathogen\u2010specific antibody or cellular immunity at the mucosal sites [my emphasis] is best elicited by mucosal application of the antigen\u2019 (Kaul and Ogra, 1998). Thus, plant\u2010made vaccines may overlap far more than was formerly thought possible with conventional vaccines, in that injectable \u2018biosimilars\u2019 or even \u2018biobetters\u2019, as defined by Yuri Gleba (Rybicki, 2009b), could compete directly with those produced by fermentation or animal cell culture.",

For example, it appears obvious that all subunit vaccines should be made in plants where this is feasible\u2014yet none are, even for animals, despite all the proofs of efficacy over more than 10 years. There is also much made of the apparent reluctance of large pharmaceutical and other companies to become involved\u2014yet when they do (e.g. Bayer and Dow), the impact is profound. Perhaps it will take the incremental successes of plant\u2010made therapeutics such as Protalix\u2019s glucocerebrocidase and the Japanese AIST group\u2019s canine IFn\u03b1 produced in strawberries for treatment of dog periodontal disease (Rybicki, 2009b), followed by vaccines for livestock such as the Argentinean BVDV vaccine, and human therapeutics such as rabies virus antibodies and even insulin and vaccines like ICON Genetics\u2019 NHL product, to finally tip the balance for broad\u2010based acceptability of plant\u2010based vaccines for human use. The apparent acceptance by the relevant funding agencies in the USA that rapid\u2010response vaccines aimed at potential bioterror agents such as anthrax and haemorrhagic fever viruses could easily be made in plants may be a valuable lever in this regard. If acceptance does happen soon, then obvious first targets\u2014other than the military options\u2014should be the niche market of \u2018orphan disease vaccines\u2019 such as for Lassa fever and the South American haemorrhagic fever viruses, and other low volume markets, rather than competitors for blockbuster vaccines such as HPV and rotavirus.
