            "text": "The ICTV is a committee of the Virology Division, which is in turn part of the International Union of Microbiological Societies. The ICTV is a nonprofit-making organization composed of prominent virologists representing countries from throughout the world who work to designate virus names and taxa through a democratic process. The ICTV operates through a number of committees, subcommittees and study groups consisting of more than 492 eminent virologists with expertise in viruses infecting humans, animals, insects, protozoa, archaea, bacteria, mycoplasma, fungi, algae, yeasts and plants. Taxonomic proposals are initiated and formulated by individuals or by the study groups. These proposals are revised and accepted by the corresponding subcommittees and presented for executive committee approval. All decisions are then ratified at a plenary session (or also now by postal vote) held at each Virology Congress where all members of ICTV and more than 50 representatives of national microbiological societies are represented. At present, there are 47 study groups working in concert with six subcommittees \u2013 namely, the vertebrate, invertebrate, plant, bacteria, fungus and virus data subcommittees. The ICTV does not impose any taxonomic terms or taxa but ensures that all propositions are compatible with ICTV rules for homogeneity and consistency. The ICTV regularly publishes reports describing all existing virus taxa with a list of classified viruses as well as descriptions of virus families and genera. An Internet web site, where the most important information relative to virus taxonomy is made available, is updated regularly. The sixth report was published by Murphy et al (1995) and the seventh by van Regenmortel et al (1999).",

The former is the monothetic hierarchical classification applied by Linnaeus to plants and animals, while the adansonian is a polythetic hierarchical system initially proposed by Adanson in 1763. In 1984 Maurin and collaborators suggested applying the linnean classification system to the viruses. Although convenient to use, this system has shortcomings when applied to the classification of viruses. Firstly, it is difficult to appreciate the validity of a particular criteria. For example, it may not be appropriate to use the number of genomic components as a hierarchical criteria. Secondly, there are no obvious reasons for prioritizing criteria, and in consequence it is difficult to rank all the available criteria. For instance, is the nature of the genome (DNA/RNA) more important than the sense of the coding sequence of the genome or the shape of the virus particles?",

The criteria leading to the same classifications are considered as correlated and are therefore not discriminatory. Subsequently, a subset of criteria are considered, and the process is repeated until all criteria can be ranked to provide the best discrimination of the species. This system has not been used frequently in the past owing to its labor-intensive nature, but this situation has changed as a result of the power and availability of today's computer technology. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative data can be simultaneously considered when generating such a classification. In the case of viruses, it was determined by Harrison and collaborators in 1971 that at least 60 characters could be used for a complete virus description (Table 1\n). Thus, the limiting factor for applying the adansonian system is now not its labor-intensive nature but the lack of data for many of the viruses.",

However, to date, none of them has satisfactorily provided a clear classification of all viruses. A multidimensional classification, taking into account all the criteria necessary to describe viruses, would probably be the most appropriate way of representing a virus classification, but again the shortcomings of data for some viruses would prevent the use of this system in the foreseeable future.",

Viruses were clustered first in genera and then in families. A subset of characters, including physicochemical, structural, genomic and biological criteria, is then used to compare and group viruses. This subset of characters may change from one family to another, according to the availability of the data and the importance of a particular character for a particular family. It is obvious that there is no homogeneity in this respect throughout the virus classification and that virologists weigh the criteria differently in this subjective process, leading to the generation of a nonhomogeneous classification. Nevertheless, over time we can see stability of the current ICTV classification at the genus and family level. When sequence, genomic organization and replicative cycle data are subsequently used for taxonomic purposes, they usually confirm the actual classification. It is also obvious that hierarchical classifications above the family level will encounter conflicts between phenotypic and genotypic criteria and that virologists will have to consider the entire classification process in order to progress in this direction.",

Since a taxonomic structure above the level of family (with the exception of the orders Mononegavirales, Caudovirales and Nidovirales) has not been developed extensively, any listing must be arbitrary. The order of presentation of virus families and genera follows four criteria: (1) the nature of the viral nucleic acid; (2) the strandedness of the nucleic acid; (3) the use of a reverse transcription process (DNA or RNA); and (4) the positive or negative sense of gene coding on the encapsidated genome. These four criteria give rise to six clusters comprising the 86 families and floating genera of viruses. In the past, two other criteria were also taken in account: the presence or absence of a lipid envelope and the segmentation of the genome as mono-, bi-, tri-, tetra- or multipartite. However, it has become clear that the presence of an envelope was entirely related to the nature of the host and that families could comprise genera having viruses with segmented or nonsegmented genomes, but sharing all other properties, including genome organization and sequence homology. These criteria have been therefore abandoned.",

Effectively, in the sixth ICTV report virus names were indicated in \u2018List of species\u2019 but they were in fact a \u2018List of virus names\u2019 with undefined taxonomic status. In the seventh ICTV report, according to the polythetic nature of the species definition, a \u2018List of species-demarcating criteria\u2019 is provided for each genus, indicating how virus species can be identified in this particular genus. Viruses are then differentiated in species and tentative species according to this list of criteria and the availability of information to demarcate the species.",

Naturally this list of criteria should follow the polythetic nature of the species definition and more than one criteria should be used to determine a new species. It is obvious that most of the criteria in the list of demarcating criteria are shared amongst the different genera, within and across families; namely, host range, serological relationships, vector transmission type, tissue tropism, genome rearrangement and sequence homology (Table 4\n). However, if the types of criteria are similar, the levels of demarcation clearly differ from one family to another. This may reflect differences in appreciation from one family to another but also the differential ranking of a particular criterion in different families. The huge differences (up to 30%) in sequences among nucleoproteins of species of lentiviruses does not have the same biological significance as small differences in capsid protein sequences (1\u201310%) of species of potyviruses, and therefore universal levels of sequence identity for similar genes may not exist for viruses! The levels of demarcation may even change from one gene to another within the same family. Homogenization of the application of the species definition concept throughout the virus definition will be the next challenge of ICTV for the eighth report to be published by 2002. This, in turn, will contribute to homogeneity of the genus and family demarcation criteria (Table 4) and will permit creation of new families or merging of existing families. However, it is important to note that the nature of the demarcating criteria at the genus level will probably not change as these have passed the test of time. Despite the fact that they were mostly established using biochemical and structural criteria, they remained valid when correlated with genome organization and sequence data.",

ICTV definition of a virus species was long considered to be \u2018a concept that will normally be represented by a cluster of strains from a variety of sources, or a population of strains from a particular source, which have in common a set or pattern of correlating stable properties that separates the cluster from other clusters of strains\u2019 as stated by Matthews in 1982 and by Francki et al in 1991. This was a general definition, which was in fact not very useful for practically delineating species in a particular family. Furthermore, this definition directly addressed the definition of a virus strain, which had never been attempted in the history of virus taxonomy. In 1991, the ICTV Executive Committee accepted a definition proposed by van Regenmortel in 1990 (see above). This definition states: \u2018A virus species is a polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche.\u2019 The major advantage in this definition is that it can accommodate the inherent variability of viruses and is not dependent on the existence of a unique characteristic. Members of a polythetic class are defined by more than one property and no single property is absolutely essential and necessary. Thus in each family it might be possible to determine the set of properties of the class \u2018species\u2019 and to check if the family members are species of this family or if they belong to a lower taxonomic level. The ICTV is currently conducting this exercise throughout all virus families. This exercise should ultimately result in an excellent evaluation of a precise definition of each virus species in the entire classification.",

However, owing to obvious similarities, plant reoviruses and rhabdoviruses had been integrated into the families Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae (Table 2). This position was mostly due to plant virologists\u2019 refusal to accept binomial nomenclature. Since this form of nomenclature was withdrawn from the ICTV classification rules in 1995, they subsequently accepted the placing of plant viruses into species, genera and families as shown in the sixth ICTV report. However, there are still 30 of so-called \u2018floating genera\u2019 that do not pertain to any family. This is mostly due to the fact that plant virologists prefer to accumulate data on virus species and genera before clustering appropriate genera in families. It is remarkable that this attitude has also been adopted by other virologists as a convenient way of classifying viruses, without having to move genera out of families when it becomes apparent that they are part of a distinct family. For example, the members of the floating genus \u2018cricket paralysis-like viruses\u2019 share enough properties with picornaviruses to be included in the family Picornaviridae; however, they also possess properties that would justify their classification in a separate family. Only new data or new viruses will permit a definitive position, therefore for the time being it remains a floating genus. Similarly the same strategy is used to create a floating genus \u2018ictalurid herpes-like viruses\u2019, within the family Herpesviridae, although in this case it is a floating genus within the family because of uncertainty as to whether the members of this genus should be classified in one of the existing subfamilies or to a new subfamily.",

The first virus order, Mononegavirales, was established in 1990 and comprises the nonsegmented single-stranded RNA negative-sense viruses, namely the families Bornaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae. This decision was taken because of the great similarity of many criteria between these families, including their replication strategy. A second order, Caudovirales, contains all the families of double-stranded DNA phages possessing a tail, including the families Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. A third order, Nidovirales, comprising the families Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae, was accepted in 1996 because of the impossibility of grouping together these two taxonomic entities, which share many properties and yet are so different, as a single family. Many members of the ICTV advocate the creation of many more orders, but it has been decided to proceed cautiously to avoid creation of short-lived orders.

The first wave of descriptions, those before 1940, mostly took into account the visual symptoms of the diseases caused by viruses, along with their modes of transmission. A second wave, between 1940 and 1970, brought together an enormous amount of information from studies of virion morphology (electron microscopy, structural data), biology (serology and virus properties) and physicochemical properties of viruses (nature and size of genome, number and size of viral proteins). Since 1970, the third wave of virus descriptions has included genome and replicative information as well as molecular relationships with virus hosts. There is a correlative modification of the list of virus descriptors and Table 1 lists the family and genera descriptors which are used in the current ICTV report. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5\nare diagrammatic representations of families and genera of viruses infecting vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, yeasts, protozoa and bacteria. The most recent wave of information used to classify viruses is naturally nucleotide and amino acid sequences. It is becoming more and more prevalent in virus taxonomy, as exemplified by the presence of a significant number of \u2018phylogenetic trees\u2019 in the seventh ICTV report, and by the huge number of scientific publications on this topic. Some scientists promote the concept of \u2018quantitative taxonomy\u2019 aimed at demonstrating that virus sequences contain all the coding information required for all the biological properties of the viruses. This is in complete agreement with the polythetic concept of the virus species definition, as demonstrated for example by Padidam et al in 1995, van Regenmortel et al in 1997, Hyppia et al in 1998, and Aleman et al in 1999.",

This technique had an immediate influence on diagnostics and classification of viruses. With negative staining, viruses could be identified from poorly purified preparations of all tissue types, and information about size, shape, structure and symmetry could be quickly provided. As a result, virology progressed simultaneously for all viruses infecting animals, insects, plants and bacteria. Thin sections of infected tissues brought a new dimension to virus classification by providing information about virion morphogenesis and cytopathogenic effects. These techniques, in conjunction with the determination of the nature of the genome, provided a major source of information for the system of virus classification established in the 1980s, as shown by the large number of viruses listed in the fifth ICTV report in 1989.",

This suggestion was in fact withdrawn from ICTV nomenclature rules in 1990 and consequently such names as Herpesvirus varicella or Polyomavirus hominis should not be used. For several years, plant virologists have adopted a different nomenclature, using the vernacular name of a virus but replacing the word \u2018virus\u2019 by the genus name; for example, Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus and Tobacco mosaic tobamovirus. Though this usage is favored by many scientists, and examples of such practice can be found for human, animal and insect viruses (e.g. Human rhinovirus, Canine calicivirus, Acheta densovirus\u2026), it has not been universally adopted by the ICTV.",

In formal taxonomic usage, the virus order, family, subfamily, genus and species names are all printed in italics (or underlined) and the first letter is capitalized. For all taxa except the species names, new names are created de novo following ICTV guidelines, but in the case of virus names English vernacular form is used. In formal usage, the name of the taxon precedes the name of the taxonomic unit; for example, \u2018the family Picornaviridae\u2019 or \u2018the genus Rhinovirus\u2019. In informal vernacular usage, order, family, subfamily, genus and species names are written in lower case Roman script; they are not capitalized nor italicized (or underlined). Additionally, in informal usage, the name of the taxon should not include the formal suffix, and it should follow the term for the taxonomic unit; for example, \u2018the mononegavirales order\u2019, \u2018the adenovirus family\u2019, \u2018the avihepadnavirus genus\u2019 or \u2018the tobacco mosaic virus\u2019 species. Virus names are often abbreviated for convenient reasons, but ICTV has not set up guidelines to generate such abbreviations. The ICTV reports list abbreviations most commonly used by specialists and the ICTV reports help virologists to identify duplicates of abbreviations in order to decrease the number of such duplicates. In 1988 plant virologists initiated the publication of such lists and have indicated guidelines for the creation of new virus names and new abbreviations. These guidelines were last published in 1991 by Fauquet and Martelli and will be updated again in 1999.",
