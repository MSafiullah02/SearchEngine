The vast majority of IgG are thus absorbed after birth, thanks to the colostrum intake over the first hours of life. Due to the immaturity of the intestinal mucosa over the first hours following birth (Paulsen, Buddington, & Buddington, 2003; Schwarz & Heird, 1994), macromolecules can be absorbed from the gut lumen into the newborn's bloodstream. However, progressive intestinal barrier closure, consequence of the differentiation of the digestive mucosa, decreases the absorption by the gut of macromolecules (including IgG) (Chastant\u2010Maillard et al., 2012). Absorption rate of immunoglobulins (i.e. per cent of ingested colostrum immunoglobulin G transferred to the bloodstream), limited at birth to 40%, drops to 14% at 8 hr and is null after 24 hr.",

The most frequent symptoms are lethargy, loss of sucking reflex, crying, diarrhoea, weight loss and hypothermia. Puppies usually die within hours after showing symptoms or suddenly with no preceding clinical signs (M\u00fcnnich & K\u00fcchenmeister, 2014; Meloni et al., 2014; Nielen et al., 1998). Bacteria most often isolated from affected newborns are E. coli, Streptococci and Staphylococci (Meloni et al., 2014; M\u00fcnnich & K\u00fcchenmeister, 2014). In total, the mortality and morbidity rates in dogs over the pre\u2010weaning period are high, reaching approximately 20% and 35% of puppies, respectively (Konde, Gitau, Kiptoon, & Gakuya, 2015; Mila & Chastant\u2010Maillard, 2014). Large breed puppies (expected adult body weight >25 kg) seem to be especially sensitive, with a higher percentage of sick puppies over the first week of life than for small breeds (<25 kg): 55% (71/128) versus 31% (64/206), respectively (unpublished data).",

Yet, in some circumstances, either from puppy or maternal origin, colostrum intake is limited or absent (e.g. weak puppy, large litters, agalactia, lack of maternal behaviour, death of the mother), precluding adequate passive immune transfer. Alternatives to colostrum are then required. The role of colostrum in energy provision can be efficiently ensured by milk replacers; however, the most critical aspect is to find colostrum substitution for efficient passive immune transfer to the newborns.",

            "text": "The immune function of mammary secretions does not terminate with the intestinal barrier closure. While IgG is the dominant Ig class of mammary secretions on the first day of lactation, percentage of IgA increases very rapidly, becoming the main Ig type from Day 7 to the end of lactation (Sch\u00e4fer\u2010Somi, B\u00e4r\u2010Schadler, & Aurich, 2005). Unlike IgG supporting systemic immunity after being absorbed into the bloodstream, IgA has a local role in the mucosal digestive immunity. Pathogen\u2010specific antibodies obtained via milk intake are crucial for the defence of the newborn, virus neutralization, inhibition of gut colonization and agglutination of microorganisms within the gastrointestinal tract (Hurley & Theil, 2011). The role of milk antibodies is supported by observations of puppies naturally exposed to canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2): despite non\u2010protective serum CPV2\u2010specific antibody titres (hemagglutination inhibition titre <1:80) at 2 days of age, none of thirteen puppies got infected before 6 weeks of life (Mila, Grellet, et al., 2014). Those results suggest that not only the global, but also local immunity provided by milk plays a role in the protection of newborn dogs. Therefore, administration of a milk substitute, supplemented with specific immunoglobulins, could be considered in at\u2010risk animals, such as hand\u2010reared puppies or puppies from large litters.",

            "text": "In cattle and horses, colostrum banking is routinely performed by breeders. Feeding of neonates with frozen/thawed colostrum could also be performed in breeding kennels. The colostrum collected from bitches living in the same kennel is the optimal solution to replace maternal colostrum in newborn puppies. It brings not only antibodies directed against local pathogens, but also large amounts of energy. In order to collect colostrum of high immune quality, bitches should be milked after cleaning of the skin, by a gentle teat massage approximately 24 hr after whelping. This delay is a compromise between the acquisition of passive immunity by the litter of the donor bitch and the kinetics of colostrum IgG concentration. Indeed, colostrum IgG concentration decreases by more than 50% over the first 24 hr after parturition (3830 mg/dl at 4 hr after the expulsion of the first puppy versus 1730 mg/dl at 24 hr (Albaret, Mila, Grellet, & Chastant\u2010Maillard, 2016)). Subsequently, IgG concentration continues to decrease, reaching approximately 200 mg/dl as early as Day 7 and remaining low until the end of lactation (Sch\u00e4fer\u2010Somi et al., 2005). One\u2010 to five\u2010ml samples should be stored in polypropylene or glass tubes and immediately frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. Before administration, frozen colostrum should be warmed up to 30\u201335\u00b0C, for example with a baby bottle warmer; microwaves should be avoided (due to immunoglobulin destruction). Freezing/thawing only slightly affects the immune properties of the colostrum and milk (Lawrence, 1999). A minimal volume of 1.5 ml/100 g of body weight (bw) should be administrated per os to puppies within the first 8 hr of life. This dose administered within that time frame was found to ensure IgG concentration above the minimal protective level (Chastant\u2010Maillard et al., 2012).",

However, early administration of bovine colostrum for acquisition of systemic immunity has never been evaluated in the newborn dog. It is questionable as heterologous colostrum would not provide antibodies specific for canine pathogens (CPV2 or canine coronavirus CCoV for example, highly pathogenic for puppies). Hyperimmune bovine colostrum and milk (with antibodies against human rotavirus) have been used with success against gastrointestinal infections in humans (Hurley & Theil, 2011), but never in the dog.",

Bovine colostrum was tested as a source of local immunity in puppies at weaning. When administered to puppies from 50 to 60 days of age (0.5 g of bovine colostrum powder/day/miniature breed puppy), an improvement in faecal consistency in supplemented puppies was stated by the authors, although the graph presented in their paper does not support this result (Giffard, Seino, Markwell, & Bektash, 2004).",
