This is a common limitation of similar studies.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 However, this allowed us to describe the management of these infections in clinical practice with the tests available for use in the acute phase, and the follow-up and treatment chosen based on the results of these tests. Secondly, the retrospective nature of the study precluded the collection of samples for assessment of other microbial coinfection or for follow-up in all patients. Finally, the lack of routine testing for mutations that confer macrolide resistance prevented us from establishing the rate of drug resistance in our sample. It is well known that there has been a worldwide increase in the circulation of macrolide-resistant MP strains.28, 29, 30\n",
