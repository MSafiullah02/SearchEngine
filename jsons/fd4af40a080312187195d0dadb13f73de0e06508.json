Methods Patients with real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 between January 01 and February 18, 2020, were included in this study. Laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical records. Severity of lung changes on chest CT of early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages was scored according to the percentage of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range 0-20). Relationship between CT scores and laboratory parameters was evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation. The Bonferroni correction adjusted significance level was at 0.05/4 = 0.0125. Results A total of 84 patients (mean age, 47.8 \u00b1 12.0 years [standard deviation]; age range, 24-80 years) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 339 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). Median chest CT scores peaked at 4 days after the beginning of treatment and then declined. CT score of the early stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.531, P = 0.011). CT score of the progressive stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.502, P < 0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.414, P = 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.511, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.423, P = 0.004), and lactose dehydrogenase (r = 0.369, P = 0.010). However, CT scores of the peak and absorption stages were not correlated with any parameter (P > 0.0125). No sex difference occurred regarding CT score (P > 0.05). Conclusion Severity of lung abnormalities quantified on chest CT might correlate with laboratory parameters in the early and progressive stages. However, larger cohort studies are necessary.",

The pathological findings of the lung showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (mainly lymphocytes). The biopsy specimens of the liver showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggesting the injury maybe induced by novel coronavirus or drugs. No obvious histological changes were seen in the heart specimens, suggesting coronavirus infection may not directly damage the heart. Although we already knew the pathological changes of multiple organs in a critically ill patient with COVID-19, little is known about the potential association between the temporal dynamic changes of the lung and other organs. The aim of this study, therefore, was to quantify the severity of lung involvement on chest CT and to determine the relationship between lung severity and laboratory parameters of infection and organ function in different disease stages, which might benefit patient care.",

From January 01 to February 18, 2020, a total of 103 COVID-19 patients were admitted to The First People's Hospital of Tianmen City, Hubei Province. All the patients were positive for COVID-19 via real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 nucleic acid by bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, or oropharyngeal swab. Critically ill patients (n = 13) and patients with consistently normal chest CT (n = 6) were excluded. Critically ill patients were defined as having one of the following conditions [16] : (1) respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation; (2) septic shock; (3) complicated with other organ failures requiring intensive care unit management. The patients underwent chest CT by a CT 64 scanner (GE Medical System), Siemens Emotion 16 scanner (Siemens Healthineers; Erlangen, Germany), and ICT 128 scanner (Philips Healthcare, Netherlands), with images indicating a 1-or 1.25-mm slice thickness. We obtained patients' laboratory parameters from medical records, including lymphocyte count (normal range, 1.1-3.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L), neutrophil count (normal range, 1.8-6.3 \u00d7 10 9 /L), white blood cell (WBC) count (normal range, 3.5-9.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L), hemoglobin (normal range, 130-175 g/L), platelet count (125-350 \u00d7 10 9 /L), C-reactive protein (CRP) (normal range, \u2264 6 mg/L), procalcitonin (normal range, 0-0.046 ng/mL), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal range, 120-250 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (normal range, 7-40 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (normal range, 13-35 U/ L), creatine kinase (CK) (normal range, 40-200 U/L), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) (normal range, 0-24 U/L), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (normal range, 22-38 s), prothrombin time (PT) (normal range, 10-14 s), and creatinine (normal range, 57-111 \u03bcmol/L). All the patients received antiviral drugs (e.g., oseltamivir, arbidol, interferon, Yanhuning, or kaletra) and antii n f l a m m a t o r y d r u g s ( e . g . , m o x i f l o x a c i n a n d / o r cefoperazone sodium and tazobactam), and most severe patients received methylprednisolone. All the patients were followed up by chest CT, which could be classified into four stages: early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages [17] . The dates of chest CT and laboratory examination were wellmatched. An overall lung total severity score (CT score) (range 0-20 points) was assigned according to Chung et al. [6] . All chest CT images were reviewed independently by two cardiothoracic radiologists with more than 10 years of experience. Final decisions were reached by consensus.",

Neutrophilia is one of the hallmarks of acute infection. Neutrophils are recruited early to sites of infection where they kill pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) by oxidative burst and phagocytosis [18] . Some literature supported the hypothesis that a little known yet powerful function of neutrophils-the ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps-may contribute to organ damage and death in COVID-19 [19] . Previous studies showed neutrophil count was notably related to disease severity [20, 21] . Neutrophil infiltration was noted in two recent reports on the pathological findings from autopsied COVID-19 patients [22, 23] . In the progressive stage, infection-related biomarkers included neutrophil count, WBC, CRP, and procalcitonin elevated. Pathological findings showed diffuse alveolar damage with inflammatory cell infiltration in this stage. Accordingly, chest CT showed diffuse GGO with consolidation. Patients with severe virus infection are more likely to be co-infected with bacteria due to low immune functions [24] . Cytokine storm in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19 might be associated with the activity of these infection-related biomarkers regulated by inflammatory cytokine.",
