            "text": "Infants aged <1 year with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) show distinct clinical features compared with older children with AML, including a higher white blood cell (WBC) count, extramedullary involvement at diagnosis, and a higher frequency of M4/M5 or M7 leukemic cells classified by the French\u2013American\u2013British (FAB) system, as well as unique cytogenetic characteristics [1, 2]. Relatively few infants have favorable cytogenetic characteristics, such as t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1, inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22)/CBFB-MYH11, or t(15;17)(q22;q12)/PML-RARA. Most infants have cytogenetic characteristics that are associated with poor prognosis, including rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on chromosome 11q23, t(1;22)(p13;q13)/RBM15-MKL1, which is highly associated with acute megakaryocytic leukemia in non-Down syndrome infants, and t(7;12)(q36;p13)/HLXB9-ETV6 [3\u20135]. Hence, infants with AML are usually classified in intermediate (IR) or high-risk (HR) groups, and are treated with an intensive combination chemotherapy regimen based on cytarabine and anthracyclines that is also used for older children. However, as infants are particularly vulnerable to intensive cytotoxic treatment, many study groups have modified the doses of chemotherapeutic drugs administered to infants [6, 7].",

Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, Down syndrome, secondary AML, myeloid/natural killer cell leukemia, and myeloid sarcoma were not eligible. AML was diagnosed using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (3rd edition) [8] with a comprehensive central diagnostic review system that used morphology, immunophenotyping [9], and cytogenetic analysis of diagnostic bone marrow specimens. Overall, 38 patients (including 5 infants) were excluded, mainly because of misdiagnosis, while 4 additional patients were excluded because the guardian refused to participate (n = 1), there was a significant protocol violation during the initial induction course (n = 1), the hospital withdrew its membership from the JPLSG (n = 1), and the patient was transferred to a non-JPLSG member hospital (n = 1). Among the 443 eligible patients, 45 (10.1 %) were infants aged <1 year at initial diagnosis. Written informed consent, provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki, was obtained from the guardians of each patient. All aspects of the study were approved by the institutional review boards at all participating institutions.",

After the second induction course, the patients were stratified to one of three risk groups according to their cytogenetic characteristics and treatment response following the initial induction course, and received three additional intensified chemotherapeutic courses. Patients who failed to achieve complete remission (CR) after the second course were removed from the study. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was indicated for all of the high-risk (HR) patients after three or more treatment courses. For patients aged <2 years, the drug doses were reduced by taking into account body weight rather than body surface area throughout the treatment course. Because of the high early mortality rate in infants, we temporarily suspended the enrollment of infants between April 2 and August 11, 2009. At this time, the following amendments were made: (1) an additional dose reduction by 33 % during induction phase 1 for infants; (2) avoidance of the prophylactic administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), considering its possibility as a risk factor for developing ARDS; (3) introduction of enhanced guidelines for supportive care in relation to infection prevention; and (4) close prospective safety monitoring during the induction phase.\n",

Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from the diagnosis of AML to the last follow-up or the first event (failure to achieve remission, relapse, secondary malignancy, or any-cause death). Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the diagnosis of AML to any-cause death. The probabilities of EFS (pEFS) and OS (pOS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Standard errors (SEs) were calculated using the Greenwood formula and curves were compared using the log-rank test. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated at the 95 % confidence level. Gray\u2019s methods were used to estimate and compare the cumulative incidence of important events (relapse, non-relapse death). All analyses were performed using STATA\u00ae statistical software (version 11.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Follow-up data were actualized as of May 1, 2012.

However, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.108) because of the relatively small numbers of patients (Fig. 3a). The median follow-up time of living patients was 3.06 years (range, 0.84\u20135.36 years). However, the 3-year pOS was significantly worse in infants (55.9 %, 95 % CI 37.9\u201370.6 %) than in those aged 1 to <2 years (77.0 %, 95 % CI 62.7\u201386.3 %) and those aged \u22652 years (74.7 %, 95 % CI 69.2\u201379.4 %; P = 0.037; Fig. 3b). The inferior survival rate in infants appeared to be due to the higher non-relapse mortality rate in this age group, rather than recurrent disease (Fig. 3c, d). The non-relapse mortality rates in infants, those aged 1 to <2 years, and those aged \u22652 years were 29.2 % (95 % CI 15.6\u201350.4 %), 7.4 % (95 % CI 2.8\u201318.9 %), and 11.8 % (95 % CI 8.3\u201316.7 %), respectively (P = 0.007). The cumulative relapse rates were 44.0 % (95 % CI 29.8\u201361.2 %), 41.0 % (95 % CI 29.0\u201355.8 %), and 42.6 % (95 % CI 37.3\u201348.3 %), respectively (P = 0.564).\n\n",

Consequently, we also amended the protocol to avoid the prophylactic administration of G-CSF, because this may aggravate inflammatory cytokine production, is often observed in engraftment syndrome after HSCT, and G-CSF was reported to have no benefits in the treatment of children with AML [14\u201316]. The BFM Study Group reported that, although hemorrhage and leukostasis were the main causes of death within the first 15 days of initial therapy, fatal infections were more common between days 15 and 42.

However, appropriate dose adjustments for infants are not well documented because very few pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in infants [18, 19]. Many factors may affect drug metabolism in infants, including higher total body water content and extracellular water content, higher unbound active fraction of drugs because of lower affinity of drugs to serum proteins, lower p450 enzyme activity, which could reduce or increase the cytotoxic effects, and lower renal clearance, which could increase systemic exposure of drugs because of reduced tubular and glomerular function until about 6 months of age. In addition, the ratio of body weight to body surface area is lower in infants than in older children. Therefore, if the doses are calculated based on the body surface area, the infants would be exposed to greater amounts of each drug. Thus, prior studies have used arbitrary methods to modify the drug doses for infants, including adjustment for body weight in the BFM [6], CCG-2891 [20], and AML99 [10] studies, while the doses were reduced by 25 % in the MRC AML-10 and AML-12 studies [7].",

Although the incidence of RSV infection is low among patients with AML, it is associated with high mortality in children with AML [21], and it is well known that infants, both immunocompetent and immunocompromised, are particularly vulnerable to RSV. Although RSV infection may be prevented with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the RSV epitope, it was not approved for use in malignant disease in Japan until August 2013, so its use was at the physician\u2019s discretion. An aerosol formulation of the anti-viral agent ribavirin is also effective against RSV infection, but only oral agents have been approved in Japan.",

Although this reduction in early and non-relapse death led to achievement of >70 % pOS for the post-amendment cohort, improvements in pEFS and pOS were not statistically significant. Naturally, there are limitations for the exact explanations due to a relatively small number of patients included in the current study, but one must consider the possibility of increased relapse led by treatment reduction in the post-amendment cohort, although cumulative relapse rate itself was not statistically different.",
