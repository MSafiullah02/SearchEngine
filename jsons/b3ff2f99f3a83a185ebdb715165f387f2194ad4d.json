In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level in the United States. We estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results suggest that stay-at-home orders reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to 680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three weeks in localities where they were implemented.",

            "text": "While the national government has the authority to act, the United States is a federal political system where public health is normally the purview of the fifty states. Furthermore, each state often delegates health authority to cities and/or counties, geographic political units nested within states. As a result, responses to COVID-19 varied across states and counties and led to spatial and temporal variation in implementation of mitigation procedures. This variation in policy responses has likely contributed to significant variation in the incidence of cases and fatalities -as well as the downstream social and economic effects of the disease --across jurisdictions in the United States. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] A variety of government policies have been proposed and used to mitigate the spread and consequence of pandemic diseases like COVID-19, ranging from investments in medical testing, contact tracing, and clinical management, to school closures, banning of mass gatherings, quarantines, and population stay-at-home orders. 12 China's extensive interventions appear to have been successful at limiting the outbreak. 13, 14 These include quarantines both for those diagnosed and those undiagnosed but who had been in Hubei province during the outbreak, 15 and restrictions on travel to and from affected areas. 16 In contrast, school closures across East Asia were estimated to be much less effective. 17 With estimates that nearly half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, epidemiological simulations suggest that quarantines of symptomatic individuals alone will be insufficient to halt the pandemic. 18 This has led to widespread adoption of population-wide policies to dramatically reduce social contact.",

Stay-at-home orders require citizens to shelter in their residence with very few exceptions and have typically been implemented along with school closures, bans on mass gatherings, and closure of non-essential businesses. These policies are associated with a significant reduction in observed mobility, 19 and initial evidence from New York City and California suggests that they can be effective in reducing case growth in the United States. 8, 20 Yet, because each locality in the U.S. has many factors that contribute to differential rates of transmission, statistical efforts to control for potential confounds and to identify the precise effects of stay-at-home orders across the U.S. are critical to understanding whether --and to what degree --such policies are working.",

In Figure 3 , we group counties by the date a stay-at-home order was implemented and show how confirmed cases and fatalities changed with respect to the order. For example, the top blue curve in both panels refers to all counties with stay-at-home orders enacted on March 23 or 24, notably including the epicenter of the pandemic in New York. We then plot the set of counties that did not issue any stay-at-home order during this time period with a thicker orange line to highlight how this group of counties differs from those with an order. Although the curves have been \"flattened\" in all counties, the flattening in counties without an order is much less, particularly with respect to cases. Each line represents an aggregation of counties that issued stay-at-home orders during the same two-day period (blue) or did not issue an order (orange). Observations are grouped to two-day pairs to facilitate visualization. Table 1 shows growth in log weekly cases both on the date an order goes into effect and 21 days after the order. Each row presents corresponding weekly growth on the same dates for the set of all counties where no such order ever went into effect. For example, the first row shows that weekly cases for the six counties who issued an order on March 17 grew from March 10 to March 17 by 1.02 units on a log scale. For the 506 counties that would never issue such an order, weekly case growth from March 10 to March 17 averaged 1.39 units on a log scale.",

For example, stay-at-home orders might closely follow earlier targeted mitigation measures at the national level (such as travel restrictions issued by the State Department or recommendations by the CDC on mass gatherings). There might also exist spurious correlation between local factors (such as the date of onset of the disease or the capacity of the health system) and the timing of stay-at-home orders. To control for these factors, we apply a two-way fixed-effects difference-in-differences model to the data (see Methods). Table 3 shows results from three models for growth in weekly confirmed cases that estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days after the orders go into effect. A fourth model shows an estimate of the effect of orders on growth in weekly fatalities after 21 days. The key estimates are in the top row of Table 3 and exponentiating these coefficients allows us to interpret them as percentage changes in weekly cases. They suggest exp(\u03b2) ) ( \u2212 1 that stay-at-home orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. Estimates are derived from fixed-effects regression models that control for county-group level and date fixed effects and for correlated observations with cluster-robust standard errors at the county-group level (see Methods). Blue dotted lines are 95% confidence intervals. Figure 4 shows these estimates along with the estimates for each day prior to and after the day a stay-at-home order goes into effect. The prior day estimates serve as a placebo test. Unlike the raw data shown in Tables 2 and 3 , the estimates here are adjusted for unobserved factors that could influence the course of the disease that vary over time and between counties. Notice that the estimates in Figure 4 before the order goes into effect exhibit high variance and the confidence intervals span zero. This suggests that county-group-level differences in case and fatality growth are not strongly influencing the timing of stay-at-home orders, helping to rule out the possibility that the later associations we see are driven by reverse-causality or differential trends.",

Given the uncertainty about how many days infected individuals are contagious both before and after the onset of symptoms, efforts to generate a sharp estimate of the effects of policies that were implemented within days of each other are difficult. Moreover, our analysis suggests these other local interventions might also have an effect on cases and fatalities. On average, the peak of infections happens three days prior to the stay-at-home order. In addition, we see significant reductions in the growth rate of cases and fatalities within days of the order. This is in spite of the fact that case identification during the early part of our observations was based on tests that often took a week to be resolved. 2 , 21 With our current empirical approach we cannot perfectly separate the effects of other local interventions from that of stay-at-home orders. This means that our estimates should properly be interpreted as the effect of stay-at-home orders bundled with effects of correlated local interventions. Our controls are the set of counties that did not issue mandatory orders, but in those localities residents may have voluntarily changed their social behaviors. As such, our estimates are the difference between the effects of an average bundle of changes in counties that issued orders relative to an average bundle of changes in counties that did not. An interesting question which we leave for future work is which local interventions in the policy mix helped the most.",
