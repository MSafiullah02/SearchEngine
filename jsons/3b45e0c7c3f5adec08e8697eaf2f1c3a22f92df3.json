Most research projects concerning the relationship between species diversity and productivity have been conducted in artificial plant communities, with only a few in natural ecosystems. In this study we examined the relationship between species diversity and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) over two consecutive growth seasons (2004 and 2005) in a semi-arid steppe ecosystem of northern China, that were subjected to different land uses. 2. Land use affected the relationship between species diversity and ANPP in this semi-arid steppe ecosystem. Exclusion of grazing without or with biomass removal by mowing increased ANPP, species richness and species diversity compared with free grazing; the effect was reflected mainly as enhanced importance of the perennial forbs functional group in terms of their relative contributions to ANPP, plant cover and plant abundance. 3. Many mechanisms regulate the relationship between species diversity and productivity. Differential effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning greatly complicate the analysis of such relationships. On grazing-exclusion sites the relationship between ANPP and species richness can be best described as an exponential growth function ( R 2 = 0\u00b799, P < 0\u00b7001, n = 24); whereas on the free-grazing site the relationship takes the form of exponential decay ( R 2 = 0\u00b796, P < 0\u00b7001, n = 24). Our study concludes that the mode and severity of disturbance are important factors for interpreting the relationship between species diversity and productivity in semi-arid steppe ecosystems.",

E-mail: osbertsun@ibcas.ac.cn in natural communities still looms large. Positive relationships between plant species (or functional group diversity) and productivity (or other ecosystem processes) have been reported in a number of experimental studies (Tilman & Downing 1994; Symstad et al . 1998; Loreau et al . 2002) . Detailed evidence from terrestrial habitats, particularly grasslands, suggests that productivity is often a non-linear, concave function of the richness of species or functional groups (Waid et al . 1999) . Mittelbach et al . (2001) found that, in 65% of the studies they examined, the relationship between biodiversity and productivity was described by a concave down function. In most recent laboratory and field experiments the effect of biodiversity on productivity was tested using artificial plant communities, where different diversity levels were established by drawing plant species from a random species pool (Kahmen et al . 2005) . These experiments under artificial conditions are, by and large, constrained in their capacity for extrapolation to natural ecosystems. Cardinale, Nelson & Palmer (2000) noted that the cause of the diversity-productivity relationship could change with environmental context. In many manipulative experiments, the simplification of environmental conditions for testing specific hypotheses could unknowingly eliminate the very factors regulating the diversity-productivity relationship that exists in natural ecosystems. For example, the relatively homogenized soils in artificial grassland ecosystems could result in underestimation of the role of niche differentiation at a smaller spatial and/or temporal scale (He et al . 2003) .",

Bonet (2004) found that land-use history played an important role in determining the ordination of communities, and that previous cropping influenced the pathway of succession in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In arid and semi-arid environments, competition and facilitation can both affect the composition and structure of plant communities (Armas & Pugnaire 2005; Michalet 2006) , and spatial variation in the balance of the two factors may, to a large extent, determine diversity-productivity relationships at a local scale. Osem et al . (2002) showed that diversity of annual plant community could be determined by interactions between grazing and smallscale spatial and temporal variation in primary productivity. Despite the spatially wide occurrence and significant regional importance, the Eurasian steppe ecosystems have been largely under-represented in the global analysis of diversity-productivity relationships.",

            "text": "Steppe ecosystems under natural conditions are constantly subjected to disturbance and environmental perturbation. The intensified anthropogenic activities in recent history have had a great impact on both the structure and functioning of the semi-arid steppe ecosystems of northern China. Some land-use practices, such as hay harvesting by mowing, have been demonstrated to cause shifts in the composition of plant functional groups and consequently to lead to changes in ecosystem functioning (Bao, Li & Zhong 2004) . To determine further how land use affects the diversityproductivity relationship in semi-arid steppe ecosystems, we conducted surveys on plant species diversity and community productivity over two growth seasons (2004 \u2212 05) on sites of free grazing and grazing exclusion, with and without hay harvesting, in Inner Mongolia, northern China. We hypothesized that the mode and intensity of disturbance due to anthropogenic activities contributed to the relationship between species diversity and community productivity. Traditional land uses in the study area have been a mixture of livestock grazing and farming. From the late 1950s to the late 1970s, the land uses of the region were managed under communal systems subject to strict government regulations. During the period 1970 \u2212 77, Duolun County experienced rapid expansion of farmlands at the expense of grasslands (Baoyin & Liu 2001) . The economic reforms and open policy since 1978 have resulted in private ownership of lands and free land-use practices by the locals. Consequently, the area was subjected to intensive farming, grazing and land-use changes that reduced the areas of grasslands (Liu & Tong 2003; Zhan et al . 2004 ). The extremely intensified land uses placed tremendous pressure on the regional grasslands, causing severe land degradation and extreme levels of desertification (Liu & Tong 2003; You et al . 2003; Zhan et al . 2004) . In recognition of the environmental problems caused by overexploitation of the lands in this agro-pastoral ecotone, in 2000 the local government imposed a policy banning livestock grazing, and sought alternative land uses that could help sustain the regional land productivity and economy. Hay production has been experimented with as one of the land-use types potentially suitable for the region. However, some areas are still used for sheep and cattle grazing.",

The FG site had been heavily grazed since 1979, with an estimated 75% of above-ground biomass consumed by livestock (mainly cattle and sheep) each year (Wang, Wang & Chen 2003) . The GE site was established in 2001 by constructing a fence around 21 ha of previously grazed grassland.

A positive relationship was found between species diversity and productivity at the community level on the minimally and moderately disturbed GE and MW plots, in line with generally recognized patterns (Tilman, Wedin & Knops 1996; Loreau et al. 2002) . On the severely disturbed FG plots, however, this pervasive pattern between biodiversity and productivity was altered in such a way that a negative correlation was displayed between ANPP and species diversity.

(2002) indicates that increase in species richness is related to increasing availability of soil resources in the low productivity range, and that primary productivity can reflect spatial and temporal variation in resource availability across plant communities in semi-arid Mediterranean grassland ecosystems. In this study, the better restored soil resources may have contributed to the higher diversity and productivity on the GE and MW plots compared with the FG plots. Experimental studies on biodiversity have shown that productivity is often a decelerating monotonic function of biodiversity (Benedtti-Cecchi 2005) . At diversity levels typically found in natural plant communities, there has been no strong evidence for a direct relationship between plant diversity and productivity (Kahmen et al. 2005a; Kahmen, Perner & Buchmann 2005b) . In a climate perturbation experiment, Kahmen et al. (2005b) found that increasing diversity enhanced below-ground productivity during drought, but above-ground productivity was reduced. In this study, we found that the relationship between ANPP and species richness was best described by an exponential growth function (R 2 = 0\u00b799, P < 0\u00b7001, n = 24) on the GE and MW plots, and by an exponential decay function (R 2 = 0\u00b796, P < 0\u00b7001, n = 24) on the FG plots. Our results provide further evidence that the precise mechanisms underlying the relationship between species diversity and productivity can be very complex (Huston 1997; Wardle et al. 1999; Aarssen, Laird & Pither 2003) , and that the mode and severity of disturbance are critical in regulating such a relationship.",

The positive diversityproductivity relationship has been largely based on the so-called 'insurance hypothesis', that more diverse ecosystems are more likely to contain species that can thrive during a given environmental perturbation and compensate for declining competitors caused by that disturbance (Pimm 1984) . In the semi-arid Mediterranean rangeland, it was found that diversity of the annual plant community was determined mainly by the less abundant species (Osem et al. 2002) , suggesting that higher species richness does not necessarily support higher productivity. On the less disturbed GE and MW plots, the positive relationship between species diversity and productivity may reflect the spatial variation in the relative balance between interspecific competition and facilitation among species in different functional groups.",

The pervasive effects of anthropogenic activities on both ecosystem functioning and biodiversity thus complicate the analysis of diversity-productivity relationship (Williams et al. 2005) . One implication of this relationship is that an increase in the spatial variability of biodiversity can cause dramatic decreases in the mean productivity of the system (Benedtti-Cecchi 2005) . In this study, freerange grazing represented a land-use type with severe disturbance by grazers that intensifies the spatial variability of habitats at smaller spatial scales, creating a range of niches suitable only for specialist plant species, in addition to the regular habitats in the ecosystem. The localized patches of high species diversity on severely disturbed plots could simply reflect the greater habitat or resource heterogeneity, rather than a strategy for maintaining the integrity of ecosystem functioning when under repeated disturbance, such as free-range grazing. On the FG plots, it was apparent that the SS functional group dominated above-ground production, and this dominance decreased with species diversity (Fig. 3 ). This could further explain the negative relationship between species diversity and productivity on the severely grazed site.",

Under harsh environmental conditions, interspecific interactions, instead of facilitation, are expected to play a vital role in determining the community structure and species composition (Bellot et al. 2004; Maestre & Cortina 2004) . On the FG plots, heavy grazing by sheep and cattle greatly suppressed the growth of dominant S. krylovii, and promoted the occurrence for less competitive plants such as S. viridis and K. cristata, which were completely absent on minimally or moderately disturbed GE and MW plots. Their specific biological characteristics may explain the occurrence of those species exclusively on the FG plots. Setaria viridis is an annual opportunistic species and propagates by seed (Li & Yan 2006) . It can grow on bare ground created by sheep grazing and trampling. Koeleria cristata is a turfed bunchgrass that reproduces from seeds and tillers, and is primarily found in sandy or coarse-textured soils (Wang et al. 1999) . The leaf layer of K. cristata extends to only 10-15 cm above the ground surface, making the species poorly competitive on less disturbed sites where high grasses are abundant (Wang et al. 1999) . Three species, O. fimbriatus, P. mongolica and E. latifolius, were found exclusively on the MW plots at relatively low frequencies. While a comprehensive explanation is not readily available for the exclusive occurrence of these species on MW plots, the activities associated with mowing may play a part in facilitating their spread under this land-use type.",

Species composition and diversity have proven to be significant determinants of ecosystem processes in grassland ecosystems (Tilman, Lehman & Thomson 1997) . We found that, under the minimal or moderate disturbances such as on the GE and MW plots, there were greater contributions by perennial forbs to community ANPP, total abundance and plant cover than under severe disturbance, such as on the FG plots. Previous studies by others have shown increased diversity of native perennial plants after grazing exclusion in a grassland ecosystem in Australia (Conway 2000) . On the MW plots, the improved light conditions by repeated harvesting of above-ground biomass might be one of the major mechanisms through which species richness was maintained, as mowing decreased the cover of perennials and favoured the recruitment of short-lived species. Bao et al. (2004) showed that, on a similar steppe ecosystem, repeated mowing resulted in replacement of the dominant rhizomatous species by short bunchgrasses after 17 years. This could account for the higher number of plant species found on the MW plots than on the GE plots.",

Moreover, the species-redundancy hypothesis asserts that many species are so similar that ecosystem functioning is independent of diversity if major functional groups are present (Vitousek & Hooper 1993) . Indeed, many factors will coexist in natural grassland ecosystems, and the relationship between biodiversity and productivity will depend largely on which driver plays a dominant role during the process.
