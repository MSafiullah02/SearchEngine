To date, on April 17, 2020, there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases and 139,378 deaths globally 3. COVID-19 is rapidly transmissible, posing a considerable threat to global public health 4. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain cellular entry into the lower respiratory tract of humans, which has also been noted to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells 1\n,\n5. Though patients typically endorse respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and shortness of breath, there have been numerous reported cases of diagnosed COVID-19 patients exhibiting gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain 6\n,\n7. A study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces for up to a month in 83.3% of patients with a mild infection, raising suspicion for the gastrointestinal tract as an additional site of viral replication 8. Additionally, another study demonstrated that out of 73 COVID-19 patients, 53.4% were found to have viral RNA present in their stool \u2013 23.3% of those patients had positive stool samples even after the viral RNA cleared from their respiratory tract 9. As such, these characteristics have clinical implications regarding the proper management of infected individuals, a potential fecal-oral route of transmission, and effective preventative infection control.",

Approximately 80% of patients demonstrate mild symptoms; 20% have severe disease; about 5% of patients exhibit critical disease symptoms such as respiratory arrest, septic shock, or multiple organ failure 6. The median incubation period for COVID-19 is five days 10. As SARS-CoV-2 has widely been studied as a respiratory tract pathogen, its extent of involvement in the gastrointestinal system is currently under investigation. A multicenter and cross-sectional study demonstrated that approximately 50% of patients experienced symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Similar studies in China supported the presence of these symptoms among COVID-19 patients (Table 1\n) 7\n,\n11\n,\n16\n,\n17. Furthermore, the time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital presentation is delayed compared to respiratory symptoms (9.0 vs. 7.3 days) 11.",

Patients with elevated liver function tests were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever, and these elevations were significantly more prevalent in male patients (68.67% vs. 38.36%). Additionally, in these patients, the CD4+ and CD8 + T cells were substantially lower as compared to those with normal liver function tests 25. Per the ACG, drops in leukocyte counts are observed in COVID-19 infection, and an elevated white blood cell count is considered a poor prognostic sign 26. Studies have found that most liver injuries are mild and transient, but severe liver damage can also occur 27. A higher magnitude of liver injury was noted in individuals with severe COVID-19, in which cases hepatoprotective drugs can be administered 5\n,\n27.",

The virus has previously been found in whole blood, serum, urine, and fecal samples 6. A study by Cai et al. demonstrated that some pediatric patients were noted to have a high frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in feces. It also confirmed prolonged viral RNA shedding in feces for at least two weeks and upwards of more than a month, raising suspicion that the gastrointestinal tract acts as another site of viral replication 8. A study conducted by Xiao et al. demonstrated results favoring gastrointestinal viral replication with potential fecal-oral route of transmission 34. Amongst 73 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China, ranging from 10 months to 78 years old, 53.42% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool. Positive stool results ranged from 1-12 days, and 23.29% continued to have positive stool results after having negative respiratory samples 34. Upon endoscopy and biopsy, the study also found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected with positive staining of the viral nucleocapsid protein in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelium. These findings further support the evidence of replication of infectious virions occurring within the gastrointestinal tract 34.",

Advantages of stool testing include the possibility that it may reduce infections in medical staff compared to oropharyngeal swab specimens 35. The definitive role of endoscopy and colonoscopy in the diagnosis of COVID-19 remains largely unclear at this point. According to the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology and the Spanish Association of Gastroenterology, upper endoscopies, ERCP, and placement of peg tube procedures have a high risk of infection transmission; colonoscopies and lower echoendoscopies are intermediate risk 36. The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy currently has similar recommendations as of March 13, 2020: endoscopy is a high-risk procedure because of the potential transmission of the virus via a fecal-oral route and the risk of transmitting COVID-19 during its incubation period in asymptomatic patients 37. Aggressive Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should be utilized during these procedures for adequate infection control.",

Some patients have experienced symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Additionally, laboratory abnormalities, hepatic injury, and pancreatic injury have been evident in a subset of patients, ranging on a spectrum with the severity of disease. As the viral receptor ACE2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract, it may play a role in the virus\u2019s ability to dysregulate the digestive system, hepatobiliary function, and pancreatic function, thereby resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms. Of note, a majority of the information presented in this narrative review was derived from reports originating from various regions in China. Consequently, application of these findings on a global scale is limited during an evolving pandemic. Likewise, the data displayed in our tables highlight variance among similar studies. As it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can remain in stool longer than respiratory specimens, it may serve as evidence for gastrointestinal viral replication and subsequent shedding. Currently, while fecal-oral transmission has not been definitively proven, there is evidence to support its possibility, warranting the need for additional precautions.",
