Each individual in each household keeps a 7 day travel diary detailing each journey made. Figure S2a shows the distribution of distances travelled classified by the purpose of the journey. On the same figure we show the same distribution as extracted from the census data for the working population. The data are not identical, but the general patterns closely follow each other. Very short journeys (less than 1km) are the least frequent journeys made, and the most common journeys are in the range of 10-15 km, both for work and for other purposes. Weekend journeys show a more pronounced tail of the distribution, implying that people are more inclined to make long journeys at the weekend. The effect of assuming that non-workers move according to two different distributions: the grey curve shows the epidemic profile for the reduced model, using the Census data to parameterise both worker and non-worker movements; the black curve shows the epidemic profile for the full model, using the Census data to parameterise worker movements, but using the National Travel Survey to parameterise non-worker movements. We parameterise our model with these two data sets in the following way:",

For large values of \u03b4 individuals spend most of their time within their home ward leading to a slow spread of disease. As this value is increased and individuals spend more time outside of their home patch, the speed and magnitude of spread is increased. This is due to increased dispersal associated mostly with random movers; workers spend all of their time in either their home patch or their work patch, but random movers may spend some time in many patches that are not their home patch. Should the total amount of time spent away from home be high, the effective coupling between patches is increased due to the presence of random movers.",

This is followed by a prodromal period during which the individual is mildly infectious and which lasts on average 3 days.
