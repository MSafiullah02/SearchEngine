            "text": "Influenza is a major health problem that poses a significant clinical and socioeconomic burden in all age groups [1]. In comparison to the general population, influenza may lead to more severe and life-threatening complications among hospitalized patients with underlying conditions [2]. It is a well-established fact that the health-care workers (HCWs) are at risk of occupational exposure, contraction of seasonal influenza and subsequent transmission to inpatients [3]. The most effective method of preventing these annual outbreaks and resulting morbidity and mortality is by influenza vaccination [4], [5], [6]. Vaccine has been reported to prevent influenza-related respiratory tract infection by 56% and overall mortality by 68% [5]. In addition, generalized influenza vaccination of HCWs has been demonstrated to positively impact on absenteeism rates and economic burden associated with seasonal epidemics [6]. In light of these evidences, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the US Public Health Service has suggested since 1981 vaccination for groups at risk of influenza-related complications, as well as for HCWs who care for patients susceptible to significant morbidity following influenza infection [7]. However, influenza vaccine acceptance by HCW has been consistently one of the lowest among groups for which immunization is recommended [8], [9], [10], [11]. The overall vaccination coverage in a previous survey performed at our institution over three consecutive campaigns ranged from 16% to 40%, far below the 60% established by the World Health Organization (WHO) for high-risk groups [9]. The reluctance of HCWs to accept influenza vaccination appears to be associated in the literature with lack of knowledge of influenza and its complications, lack of availability, or perception of low personal susceptibility, among others factors [10].",

As a result of the strain's novelty, most people lack innate immunity against this agent. An early case report from Mexico reported that 12% of HCWs caring for influenza cases developed respiratory symptoms [13], and nosocomial outbreaks of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza have been recently documented [14]. On 29 July 2009 the ACIP recommended the vaccination efforts focus on five key populations, including health-care and emergency medical services personnel [15]. To date, the majority of studies examining vaccination attitudes and compliance among HCWs have been centered on seasonal influenza [8], [9], [10], [11], [16]. In our knowledge, very few reports have specifically assessed the barriers to and facilitators of pandemic vaccine receipt in this population, and all of them were performed before the beginning of the current immunization campaign [17], [18], [19]. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the actual vaccination rates as well as the conceptions and attitudes towards both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine among HCWs in a tertiary-care university hospital.",

In a study performed at 31 hospital departments in Hong Kong, Chor et al. evaluated the acceptability of pre-pandemic vaccination against both influenza A subtypes H5N1 and H1N1 among 2255 HCWs [18]. The survey was conducted during two different periods: January 2009 to March 2009, when the WHO pandemic alert level assigned to H5N1 influenza was phase 3, and May 2009, when the WHO pandemic influenza alert level for (H1N1) 2009 influenza reached phase 5. The authors found a consistently low overall willingness to accept vaccination against either H5N1 (28.4% for the first survey, increased to 34.8% in the second one) or H1N1 influenza (47.9%). The most common reasons cited for refusal of immunization were similar to those found in our study, and included \u201cworry about side effects\u201d and \u201cquery on the efficacy of the vaccine\u201d. No significant differences were found in the level of acceptance for pre-pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine along the two study periods, despite the escalation to WHO alert phase 5 [18]. Schwarzinger et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1434 French general practitioners (GPs) between June 16 and September 22, 2009 [17]. Over 60% of respondents declared their willingness to accept the pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccination as soon as it became available; GPs working part-time in long term care facilities, being on call for emergencies, and having the highest workload in practice were more likely to express their willingness to accept immunization. A history of seasonal influenza vaccination in the prior years emerged as the strongest predictive factor associated with acceptance [17]. Finally, a recent questionnaire survey on the attitude towards pandemic influenza vaccination of 441 HCWs at five Greek hospitals in November 2009 has showed a low acceptability rate (17%), which is in line with that of our study [19].",

Various explanations could be considered. Among the most obvious is that such studies only documented the willingness to accept immunization, which may not necessarily reflect the actual behaviour of the surveyed worker or the extent of the \u201cemotional epidemiology\u201d regarding pandemic influenza vaccination, as it has been recently termed by Ofri [24]. Comparison of these results should also take into consideration the role of workplace cultures or local factors, such as the 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were HCWs [25]. Finally, the discrepancy we observed could be consistent with other preliminary reports. Schwarzinger et al. pointed out that 1 month after the pandemic influenza vaccination campaign started in France, uptake rates remained below 10% among HCWs regardless of the positive attitudes reported by GPs surveyed in their study [17]. With regards to the general population, Lau et al. reported that 45% of participants in a cross-sectional survey in Hong Kong would be highly likely to take up pandemic influenza vaccine [26], and 67% of responders in another study among adult Australians indicated their willingness to receive such a measure [27]. However, and despite these relatively high reported acceptance rates for pandemic vaccination, the actual coverage rates among the general adult population in France and the United States were as low as 7.9% and 20% by the end of January 2010, respectively [28], [29].",

            "text": "In accordance to literature [9], [10], [16], [18], both resident and staff physicians in our institution were found to be more receptive to either seasonal or pandemic vaccination than HCWs belonging to other groups. A higher professional category may be associated with a better knowledge about the indications and safety of vaccines, or could act as a surrogate for salary level, a variable that has been demonstrated to predict the acceptability of immunization [23]. On the opposite, nurses and nursing assistants have the lowest coverage rates for pandemic vaccination (3.9% and 8.1%, respectively), a finding that is consistent with previous experience on seasonal influenza [9], [16], [20]. In the present study, as well as in others [9], [10], [21], a history of previous seasonal influenza vaccination has been identified as a strong predictor of receipt of immunization in the following year. However, this factor did not retain significance in our multivariate model for pandemic vaccination, which is clearly opposite to the survey by Schwarzinger et al. [17]. Regardless of the potential impact of variations in attitudes toward vaccination between different professional categories, these results suggest the role of specific barriers among HCWs that might have limited the acceptability in a global scenario of pandemic alert. In the bivariate analysis, a history of regular patient contact was related with a lower seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, with the difference not reaching statistical significance in the multivariate model. We hypothesized that this subgroup of HCWs may have developed some degree of \u201cemotional tolerance\u201d towards the disease. The massive application of additional measures (i.e., protective facial mask or hand washing) imposed during the current pandemic could have favoured the development of a subjective sense of protection against the risks associated with the seasonal influenza. Specific educational interventions should be aimed at reducing such a misperception.",

Perceived risk of contracting the infection was one of the factors showing the strongest association with intention to accept pandemic vaccination in the study by Chor et al. [18]. Although these results agree with those reported by previous studies focused on seasonal influenza [10], [11], [16], we found statistically significant differences in the relative distribution of both arguments according to the type of immunization (Fig. 1). \u201cSelf-protection\u201d was more frequently argued among HCWs that reported having received the seasonal influenza vaccine (51.9%) as compared to those that accepted pandemic influenza vaccination (33.3%); conversely, \u201cprotection of the patient\u201d was cited as the main argument by 23.7% and 31.0% of responders who received seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine, respectively (P-value < 0.05 for both comparisons). Most educational programs for HCWs have focused on diminishing the risk of nosocomial influenza transmission to high-risk patients, and it may be assumed that this message has been strengthened in view of the initial uncertainty regarding the novel virus. Interestingly, those surveyed who received the pandemic vaccine were also more likely to argue the \u201cprotection of own family and colleagues\u201d as the main reason for acceptance, despite the lack of a professional or contractual relationship between HCWs and their relatives.",

In the current study, the proportion of non-recipients expressing \u201cfear of adverse reactions\u201d as the main reason for refusal significantly differs between seasonal and pandemic vaccination (Fig. 2). The coincident temporal association between some life-threatening conditions (i.e., Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome) and previous pandemic vaccination programs, as observed after the swine influenza virus outbreak in 1976, may have raised unfounded concerns among the general population [31]. It is reasonable to assume that HCWs share to some extent a similar view about the vaccine, despite of their training and the communication efforts by the health authorities [22], [32]. In addition, some media reports have expressed concerns about the safety of the new pandemic vaccine and its adjuvants, or the reliability of the expedited authorization process, thus magnifying those unfounded perceptions [33]. Conversely, the low compliance with immunization schedules by HCWs as covered by the media may pose an additional barrier against the acceptability of pandemic vaccine among the general population [34].",

The random sampling was conducted initially, but subsequent selection by quotas may enter a potential selection bias of unknown magnitude or direction. Most of the questionnaires used for the analysis were obtained in the first two waves of the survey reflecting HCWs with similar attitudes. We exclusively relied on self-reports of immunization status or perceived membership in a high-risk group, and these data were not verified through medical or institutional records. Reporting may be subjected to workers\u2019 own knowledge or attitudes towards immunization programs. The survey design prevented us from indentifying any non-responder bias, although similar studies have failed to find relevant differences between responders and non-responders [35]. We did not evaluate the role of specific conditions in the perception of risk among HCWs falling into a priority group for immunization (i.e., chronic lung diseases, pregnancy or obesity). Among the strengths of our study is that it is the first to evaluate not only the anticipated willingness previous to the implementation of immunization schedules, but also the actual uptake of pandemic vaccine in a group of HCWs. The survey was performed very close to the end of the immunization campaign with the aim of minimizing the risk of recall-bias. Finally, our results are consistent in general with those previously focused on seasonal influenza vaccination, including those performed in our setting [9], [21].",
