The relative transmissibility  of isolated classes in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are estimated as 0.4269, 0.4202, and 0.5649 (see blue lines in Fig. 5), respectively, which are all less than their respective threshold.

The time t1 is min{t > 0,E1(t) + E2(t) + I(t) + J(t) + D(t) = 0}. Although the explicit formula between the final size Z and \u03b8 cannot be obtained, there exists a threshold which decides whether the final epidemic size increases as \u03b8 increases. The relationship between Z and \u03b8 is similar to that between R0 and \u03b8. For example, it follows from Fig. 6(a) that if the effectiveness of isolation is lower than 11.76%, i.e., the relative transmissibility  of isolated class is greater than 88.24%, then the final epidemic size increases as \u03b8 increases. This suggests that strict measures must be taken to limit the contact of isolated individuals. Otherwise, low effectiveness of isolation would lead to more infected individuals because isolated people live longer due to improved medical care and have more chances to infect other people. The benefit of having a reduced transmission rate would be counteracted by a longer infectious period of the isolated class. Fig. 6(d\u2013f) show the situation in which the final epidemic size decreases as \u03b8 increases.",

We examine how the final epidemic size changes with an increasing media impact q in Fig. 8. For example, increasing m1 (or m2) by 30% from its baseline value (while keeping other parameters fixed) can reduce the final epidemic size by 7.62% (or 17.81%) in Guinea, 22.79% (or 0.31%) in Sierra Leone, and 1.68% (or 21.95%) in Liberia, respectively. This indicates that the response to the reported cumulative deaths (m2) may be stronger than the response to reported cumulative cases (m1) in Guinea and Liberia. A possible explanation of this result is that the case fatality rate in these two countries is relative high (see Table 1). Thus, people had increased attention to EVD-induced deaths. In Sierra Leone, an opposite scenario was observed. In conclusion, the analysis of media impact indicates that massive news coverage on cumulative cases and deaths would greatly curb the spread of the Ebola disease.",

It shows that increasing the efficacy of intervention leads to a decline in R0 in all three countries. In particular, the epidemic in Guinea could be controlled by following very restrict burial procedures (a large zD). For example, when 1/\u03b3D = 2 (blue line in Fig. 9(a)) and the efficacy of interventions zD exceeds about 70%, the basic reproduction number R0 will become less than 1. However, reducing transmission during funerals is insufficient to control the disease in Sierra Leone or Liberia no matter how large zD is (Fig. 9(b\u2013c)). This is because the burial-related transmission contributes less to the spread of the disease in Sierra Leone (R0D/R0 = 6.5%) and Liberia (R0D/R0 = 15.8%) than in Guinea (R0D/R0 = 25.4%). Figure 9 also demonstrates that R0 decreases as the duration of funeral decreases. This suggests that the duration of funeral should be as short as possible for the control of the disease.",

The magnitude of these PRCCs shows the sensitivity of these parameters and the sign of the PRCCs indicates a positive or negative correlation between the inputs (i.e. parameters) and outputs (i.e. R0 and the final epidemic size). It follows from Fig. 10(a\u2013c) that the two parameters with the most significant impact on R0 are the relative transmissibility  of isolated classes and duration of the burial 1/\u03b3D. A smaller relative transmissibility  of isolated classes or a shorter duration of burial results in a smaller R0, which is consistent with the results shown in Figs 5 and 9. These two parameters  and 1/\u03b3D) also have the most significant impact on the final epidemic size, as shown in Fig. 10(d\u2013f). These results suggest that increasing the effectiveness of isolation (decreasing ) and shortening the duration of funerals (1/\u03b3D) are of crucial importance to reduce the EVD infection. The effect of media (m1 or m2) has no effect on R0 (see the formula of R0 in (3)), which is in agreement with the findings in refs. 10, 11, 12,17 that the media impact does not affect the epidemic threshold.

In Liberia, the EVD epidemic reached the peak around mid-September 20142627, which is in good accordance with our simulated peak time, 14 Sep 2014, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Large-scale trials of vaccination were initiated on 2 February 2015 in Liberia but the efficacy of vaccination is unclear. To understand the effect of the timing of vaccine administration on the spread of EVD and the final epidemic size, we fit the model (1) to the cumulative infected cases in Liberia from 2 February 2015 to 22 March 2015 and estimated the vaccination rate \u03be and the efficacy of vaccine \u03b7 (see Table 1). After initiating the vaccine, the reproduction number is reduced from 1.7994 to 0.9873 (Table 1). Using the estimated values of \u03be and \u03b7, we plotted how the simulated cumulative cases would vary with different timing of vaccination. It shows that the earlier the vaccination is initiated, the lower the cumulative cases (Fig. 11(a)). It follows from Fig. 11(b) that the final epidemic size grows with delayed vaccination. There would be 20 more cases if vaccination had started one week later (Fig. 11(b)). This indicates that the timing of vaccine administration does not have a big effect on the final size when the epidemic declines.",

The model includes the effect of case isolation, media impact, post-death transmission and vaccination. By fitting the model to the WHO reported data of infected cases and deaths (Fig. 2), we obtained reasonable estimates of the parameters (Table 1). The basic reproduction number in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia is estimated as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively. They are all in good agreement with previous estimates (Table 2). The simulated results indicate that the outbreak in the above countries reaches the peak on 19 Oct 2014, 12 Oct 2014, 14 Sep 2014, respectively (see Fig. 3), which also agrees with the observations in Sierra Leone252728 and in Liberia262728.",

On the contrary, if the infectious period of isolated individuals is longer than that of non-isolated, then when the isolation effectiveness is relatively low (e.g. , there will be more infected cases as the fraction \u03b8 of latent individuals prior to symptoms onset increases (Figs 5 and 6(a\u2013c)) or the duration 1/\u03b1 between symptoms onset and isolation decreases (Fig. 7).

One is that the infectious period of isolated individuals (i.e. 1/\u03b3r) is longer than that for non-isolated individuals because of improved clinical care. This is consistent with the parameter estimates shown in Table 1. The other reason is that a majority of patients (\u03b8) are isolated but the isolation may not be effective in reducing the transmission of the disease. Ebola virus is very contagious and the transmission is also rapid, which makes isolation, as a containment strategy, usually inefficient33. This agrees with the estimate of  in Table 1, which is not small, implying that isolated individuals still have a high capacity to transmit the virus.",
