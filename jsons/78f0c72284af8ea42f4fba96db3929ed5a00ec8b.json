This is primarily due to both the detection of old foci of existing viral infections, such as plague, anthrax, Ebola, and the emergence of the new infections caused by coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (2002) , MERS-CoV (2015) , and SARS-CoV-2 (2019). Almost all mathematical models describing the development of epidemics are based on the model proposed in 1927 by Kermack and McKendrick in work [6] , which is now known as the classic SIR model. This model is based on 3-step development of the epidemic, in which healthy but susceptible individuals (susceptible) S as a result of infection go to the infected class (infected) I individuals who, in turn, move to class R (removed), i.e. recover by acquiring immunity (recovered), or die (dead). Note that the SIR model was constructed by analogy with the theory of homogeneous chemical reactions. This model has many generalizations that include additional stages of individuals known as SIRS, SEIR, SEIRS, and others.",

Today, many generalizations of the classic SIR model have been proposed, which use more complex scenarios for the development of the epidemic, taking into account the latency period, the finiteness of the time when individuals are in the stage of immunity, the impact of vaccination, etc. The classical SIR model, as well as most of its generalizations, are essentially homogeneous models, i.e. they assume that the intensity of infection does not depend on any relationship between healthy and infected individuals. Nevertheless, even in such homogeneous models, adequate estimates of the scenario for the development of real epidemics are possible. Recently, a number of heterogeneous generalizations of the SIR models based on deterministic or random networks have also been proposed (see, for example, [7, 8, 9, 10] ), taking into account the heterogeneous nature of the populations in which the epidemic is spreading. As a rule, this heterogeneity is associated with the difference in the characteristics of individual individuals, or with the heterogeneity of territorial population. Meanwhile, the most important characteristic that plays a crucial role in the speed of spread of the epidemic is the distribution of the duration of infectious contact between pairs of individuals. This value can be a characteristic of population heterogeneity, and it allows us to introduce a distance function on a set of individuals (metric) in terms of which it is possible to generalize the classical SIR model.",

We describe the procedure for such hierarchical clustering of a set of individuals and show that such clustering involves the introduction of a distance function on the space of individuals, which is ultrametrics. This distance function is not directly related to the spatial distance between individuals, it is determined only by the potential for transmission of infection from one individual to another per unit of time. Using the ultrametrics function on a set of individuals, we generalize the equations of the classical SIR model and arrive at a model that we call the basic ultrametric SIR model. As you know, a convenient tool for parameterizing ultrametric spaces is the field of p-adic numbers. We consider the ultrametric set of individuals that maps to the boundary of a finite hierarchical graph with a constant number of branches. Since such a set is parametrized by the factor set of a p-adic ball of radius greater than 1 over the ring of p-adic integers. The corresponding ultrametric SIR model, we call the p-adic SIR model. We present a numerical analysis of the p-adic SIR model and compare its behavior with the classical SIR model. We also introduce the concept of hierarchical isolation index and consider the simplest scenario for managing this parameter in order to reduce the spread of the epidemic.",

In almost every specific case, the value of the infective contact is extremely difficult to calculate accurately,but it is always possible to approximate it. However, in any real assessment of the duration of infectious contact, it must be understood that this concept does not necessarily mean physical contact between two individuals. The probability of infection of one individual by another individual may occur indirectly, i.e. through a physical contact with surrounding bodies (air, objects) that became sources of infection after physical contact with an infected individual. However, infectious contact does not imply the possibility of infection of a healthy individual by an already infected individual through any other individuals. Intuitively speaking, the term \"infectious contact\" is a continuous period of time during which a particular individual has the potential for infection (no matter how small it is) at any time, and this possibility of infection is caused by a particular individual.",

To illustrate, we will consider a situation where, as the epidemic grows, enforcement restrictions are introduced to redistribute the time of infectious contact between individuals in clusters of different levels, while maintaining the average contact time is constant. In reality, the introduction of such restrictions means that infectious contact between pairs of individuals with a small ultrametric distance must de increased, and infectious contact between pairs of individuals with a large ultrametric distance must be decreased. In the p-adic model, the introduction or strengthening of already introduced restrictions means an increase in the \u03b1 parameter. In Figure 6 , we present dependence of the cumulative number of infected individuals in the case of controlling their hierarchical isolation, i.e., increasing the value of parameter \u03b1 at time t 1 from value \u03b1 1 = 0.8 to value \u03b1 2 = 1.1 with other parameters equal to p = 5, n = 8, \u03b2 = 0.2, \u03b3 = 0.1.
