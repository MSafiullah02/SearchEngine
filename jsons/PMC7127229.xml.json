NAbs, by virtue of their reactivity against pathogens and host receptors, have long been recognized to block or delay infection of cells by microbes. NAbs can enhance the recruitment of virus into lymphoid organs where they are presented to T and B cells, thereby eliciting an active immune response [22]. In concert with complement, NAbs act as endogenous adjuvants for the generation of a vaccine-induced protective CD8 T-cell response [23]. Indeed, antibodies within IVIg that are directed against CD4 and chemokine CCR5 receptors have been shown to block the infection of HIV in vitro\n2, 24. Antibodies in IVIg enhance opsonization and thus promote phagocytosis and antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity [25] (Figure 2). Furthermore, IVIg has been shown to stimulate the production of PV-B19 virus-specific IgG with a concomitant increase in the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-4 [14], cytokines that are important in immunoglobulin class switch (the process by which a B cell produces a different class of antibody with the same specificity, indicating the progression of the immune response).",

A significant increase in plasma neutralizing activity against superantigens expressed by autologous streptococci has been observed in patients with iGAS following IVIg treatment [6]. A recent report suggesting that neutralizing anti-interferon gamma autoantibodies favour recurrent infections with intracellular pathogens might open novel prospects for IVIg therapy [28]. Owing to its high content of anti-idiotypes, IVIg can neutralize and downregulate the synthesis of such autoantibodies by B cells that express the relevant idiotype [2].",

However, there are enough encouraging experimental and clinical data to maintain continuing interest in the IVIg field and demand further studies in infectious conditions for which IVIg has been found to be beneficial in uncontrolled studies (i.e. those that lack placebo-controlled clinical trials). Controlled trials, particularly with viral diseases and certain defined septic subgroups where IVIg represents a promising but unproven treatment, are imperative. It is evident, however, that IVIg preparations must contain the functionally active and optimal amounts of antigen-specific antibodies to be effective. IVIg preparations have not been compared thoroughly for efficiency and adverse events. According to regulatory guidelines, IVIg products are tested for sterility, purity, pyrogenicity and safety. However, no strict requirements exist concerning concentrations of specific antibodies. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms of action of IVIg in infectious diseases and the relative role of functional antibodies within IVIg.",

Indiscriminate use of antimicrobials and failed treatments with \u2018old and simple\u2019 drugs because of economic reasons in developing countries has also led to more severe disease or to the spread of infection, along with its contingent selection pressure, leading to the emergence of variants.
