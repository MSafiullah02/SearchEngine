Present findings confirm that the infectious profile is better in T\u2010cell replete vs. T\u2010cell depleted haplo\u2010transplantation 10; the lower incidence of infections observed after day +100 may reflect a partial and quite effective restoration of antimicrobial immunity during the post\u2010transplant period in this type of haplo\u2010HSCT. Importantly, the low rate of chronic GVHD seen in our cohort is likely to contribute to this phenomenon, as chronic GVHD is known to be a major risk factor of late morbidity and mortality 11. Nevertheless, we found an unexpected 26% TRM incidence, higher than that originally reported with post\u2010HSCT Cy 3; this may be a result of the inclusion of patients with more advanced disease in the haplo\u2010HSCT program at our center.",

The 54% of CMV reactivations found here was comparable to the 38\u201350% reported in similar haploidentical settings 3, 12, 13; the slightly higher incidence that we found here may be explained by the longer follow\u2010up in our series. The polyomavirus\u2010associated cystitis rate of 19%, which is lower than that reported in the myeloablative setting 14, is likely because of the different conditioning regimens in our cohort, although a role played by the different GVHD prophylaxis cannot be excluded; indeed, BK virus nephropathy was found to be more frequently associated with tacrolimus than with cyclosporine in recipients of kidney allografts 15. Here, a quarter of the patients (18/70) received cyclosporine as GVHD prophylaxis. Interestingly, we confirm the lack of EBV\u2010related lymphoproliferative disorders, as recently reported also by Kanakry et al. 16.",

The post\u2010transplant high\u2010dose Cy permits naive and non\u2010activated memory cells to reconstitute the immune system later on 19, 20, enabling patients to be protected from late infectious events. The same mechanism probably also explains the high viral reactivation incidence found in the first 6 months, owing to the low number of adoptively transferred memory T cells in the early phase after transplantation (Lugli E. et al., unpublished data).",

Future comparisons with other haploidentical platforms and/or other alternative stem cell sources (i.e., cord blood), as well as investigations of novel strategies of transfer of immunity are warranted.
