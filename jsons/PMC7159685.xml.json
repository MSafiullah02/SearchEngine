The effect is greatest where a producer is targeting store sales for surplus stock because of restrictions on trading of cattle from the BJD\u2010infected herds. The authors noted the significant risks associated with the control strategies they modelled, and suggested that although BJD is unlikely to be a major problem for herds that are able to trade cattle, living with BJD is not a viable option for stud herds because of the restrictions on the sale of cattle.",

The higher prevalence of the diseases in the Northern Territory is it is likely because the tick vector, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is widespread in this northern tropical region. Also, aboriginal community dogs are free\u2010roaming, which increases tick infestation. No ticks were seen on any of the pound dogs. The authors conclude that this study has detected and provided the first characterisation of three species of haemotropic mycoplasma infecting dogs in Australia and that they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anaemia in dogs.",

Samples were obtained from 32 cats that were euthanased at an animal shelter. Some cats infected with canine parvovirus variants may have clinical signs including severe gastroenteritis and leucopenia, as well as cerebral hyperplasia and ataxia in neonates, whereas others may have no clinical signs. The study showed the presence of parvovirus DNA in apparently healthy cats that were assumed to be unvaccinated. The authors suggest that further studies are needed to categorising infections in a large population of cats with known clinical histories, and that this should include bone marrow, faeces and blood for PCR and serology.",

The authors note that as the placement of the needle tip was relatively consistent, the recommended large volumes of anaesthetic may not be necessary and may cause inadvertent lingual nerve anaesthesia.

The report shows clear pictures of the plant as well as the gross appearance and histological appearance of the brain. Both horses were euthanased on humane grounds because of the hopeless prognosis associated with suspected poisoning. Pasture has to be dominated by young green plants before flowering, and up to 70% of body weight must be consumed for poisoning to occur. The diagnosis was based on the presence of clinical signs with a history of long\u2010term access to large quantities of the plant. Differential definitive diagnosis is made by brain histopathology, and although MRI has been reported to be diagnostic, this is not really practical as a poisoning is irreversible and fatal.",
