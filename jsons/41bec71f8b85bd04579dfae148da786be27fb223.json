            "text": "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) are caliciviruses that produce severe symptoms and are lethal to rabbits and hares. The folding of the capsid protein was studied by determination of the antigenic pattern of chimeric capsid proteins, composed of regions from RHDV and EBHSV capsid proteins. The anti-RHDV monoclonal antibody (MAb) E3, which is known to bind an external conformational epitope, recognized the RHDV C-terminal region. The anti-RHDV MAb A47, which binds a buried epitope, recognized the RHDV N-terminal region. Using a pGEX expression library, we more precisely mapped the MAb A47 epitope on a 31 residues length peptide, between residue 129 and 160 of the VP60, confirming its location in the N-terminal part of the protein. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal part of the protein is accessible to the exterior whereas the N-terminal domain of the protein constitutes the internal shell domain of the particle. With the aim of using virus-like particles (VLPs) of RHDV as epitope carriers or DNA transfer vectors, we produced in the baculovirus system three proteins, N1, N2 and N3, truncated at the N terminus. The N1 protein assembled into VLPs, demonstrating that the first 42 amino acid residues are not essential for capsid assembly. In contrast, N2, from which the first 75 residues were missing, was unable to form VLPs. The small particles obtained with the N3 protein lacking residues 31 to 93, located in the immunodominant region of the RHDV capsid protein, indicate that up to 62 amino acid residues can be eliminated without preventing assembly.",

            "text": "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) are caliciviruses, classified to the new genus Lagovirus of the Caliciviridae family [15] . These viruses cause hemorrhaging and necrotic hepatitis, and may kill 90% of rabbit or hare populations in less than 72 hours. The calicivirus genome is a 7.5 kb positive sense single-stranded RNA with a VPg linked to its 5 extremity [2] . The virus is 35-40 nm in diameter and has a structured surface, with regularly arranged cup-shaped depressions [12] . The virions consist of a single capsid protein with a molecular weight of 58 to 65 kDa. Although such a structure is common among plant viruses, it remains exceptional for animal viruses, making these viruses an interesting model for studying the assembly process. This structure also makes these viruses very good candidates for gene transfer or epitope carrier vectors. However, several caliciviruses, including lagoviruses and human caliciviruses, do not replicate efficiently in cell culture. The expression of cDNAs encoding the capsid proteins of lagoviruses and other caliciviruses in the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system has circumvented this problem. The resulting recombinant proteins were obtained in large amounts and self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs). The production of VLPs has been of great value in immunological and epidemiological studies of caliciviruses. Studies of the assembly process have shown that VLPs contain no nucleic acid and, therefore, that self-assembly into particles must be an intrinsic property of the calicivirus capsid protein. Electron cryomicroscopy analysis followed by three-dimensional resolution of Norwalk calicivirus VLPs [13] and RHDV VLPs [17] has shown that each of these particles consists of 90 dimers of the capsid protein. The X-ray crystallographic structure of Norwalk VLPs was recently published [14] . Resolution of the atomic structure of the Norwalk protein has led to more precise determination of the organization of domains in the protein: the shell domain (S) is constructed from the N-terminal half of the capsid protein and the protruding domain (P) from the C-terminal half. Various studies have suggested that the RHDV capsid protein probably folds in a similar way [5, 9] , but no conclusive proof has yet been obtained. If we are to use calicivirus VLPs as transfer vectors, a more thorough understanding of capsid protein structure and folding is essential.",

The inserts encoding modified capsid proteins were generated by PCR with plasmids containing the VP60 gene of RHDV-SD [16] or the VP60 gene of EBHSV-GD [8] , as a template, and various sets of oligonucleotides as primers. An initial ligation step was necessary to produce inserts encoding chimeric capsids. The part of the insert corresponding to the N-terminal region was produced by PCR using primer 18 TCTAGAAGATCTatgGAGGGCCAAAGCCCGCAC in association with primer 202 TCTAGAACGCGTCCTCTTCGATGGTCAATGTCG for RE and primer 39 AGATCTAGATCTATGGAGGGTAAGCCTCGGGC in association with primer 200 TCT AGAACGCGTCCGCTTGGATGGTCAATGTCG for ER. The fragment corresponding to the EBHSV C-terminal region of the RE insert was amplified with primer 199 TCTAGAACG CGTTTCCTACCCCTCTGGCAGTGC and primer 308 TCTAGAAGATCTTCAGACATA GGAATATCCAGT whereas the fragment corresponding to the RHDV C-terminal region of the ER insert was amplified with primer 201 AGATCTACGCGTAAGTTACCCTGGGAAC AACGC and primer 15 TCTAGAAGATCTAGTCCGATGAATTCAGACAT. A MluI restriction site (shown in bold typeface) was added to the end of primers 199, 200, 201 and 202. The PCR products generated with these primers were digested with MluI and ligated in standard conditions using T4 DNA ligase. As a BglII (BamHI-compatible) restriction site had been added to primers 15, 18, 39 and 308, the products of this first ligation step were then digested with BglII and ligated into BamHI-digested pBluescript SK (\u2212) (Stratagene) to produce pB-RE and pB-ER. The recombinant baculovirus encoding the entire capsid protein of RHDV (BacG320) has been described elsewhere [6] . The three RHDV proteins with N-terminal deletions produced by recombinant baculoviruses are described in Fig. 1 . All recombinant baculoviruses were produced with the Bac-to-BacTM system (Gibco-BRL), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The various inserts encoding modified RHDV capsid proteins were generated by PCR with plasmids containing the VP60 gene of RHDV-SD [16] as a template, and various sets of oligonucleotides as primers.

For N3 an initial ligation step was necessary to produce insert. The 5 part of the insert was produced by PCR by using primer 18 and primer 173 TCTAGAACGCGTGCCATCGGTTGTGGTT while the 3 part of the insert was produced with primer 15 in association with primer 172 TCTAGAACGCGTCAACATTCTCCACAGAACAA. The PCR products generated were digested with MluI (restriction site added to the end of primer 172 and 173, indicated in bold) and ligated in standard conditions using T4 DNA ligase. As a BglII (BamHIcompatible) restriction site had been added to primers 15, 18, 170, and 171 all inserts were digested with BglII and ligated into the BamHI-digested pFastBac plasmid provided with the Bac-to-BacTM system (GIBCO-BRL).

The ends of these fragments were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and the fragments were then ligated into the pGEX-3 expression vector (Pharmacia), cut with BamHI and blunted with the Klenow fragment. The pGEX library was first screened for the presence of the VP60 insert by Southern blotting with the ECL system, as described by the manufacturer. Thirteen other constructs, pGEX I to pGEX XIII were generated by inserting defined PCR products into the BamHI-EcoRI digested pGEX-3 vector according to standard procedures. Inserts were obtained by PCR with a plasmid containing the VP60 gene of RHDV-SD [16] as the template and primers 557 (GAATTCACTGACTAGTGTGGGAACAAGGGC) and 556 (GGATCCAACATTCTCCACAGAACAACCCA) for pGEX I, 557 and 840 (GGATC CGTGGCATGCAGTTTCGCTTCA) for pGEX II, 557 and 841 (GGATCCTAGTTGCCG GATCGGGTGTG) for pGEX III, 557 and 579 (GGATCCTGGTGGGCGGTTGGTTGCGG) for pGEX IV, 557 and 558 (GGATCCCGGCCGTGATACCACCGGGCATC) for pGEX V, 556 and 843 (GAATTCACTGATGGTGACAGGTTCAAGTG) for pGEX VI, 556 and 842 (GAATTCACTACGAGCGTCGATGACAACATGG) for pGEX VII, 556 and 580 (GAATTC GGGAATTGCCTGACCTCCAGCCC) for pGEX VIII, 556 and 559 (GAATTCCCCTG GTCCAATCTCGATGCCCGG) for pGEX IX, 840 and 843 for pGEX X, 841 and 842 for pGEX XI, 579 and 580 for pGEX XII, 579 and 842 for pGEX XIII. As BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were present at the end of primer, PCR products were digested by both enzymes before cloning into the pGEX3 vector. MAb A47 was used for immunoscreening of the bacterial colonies as previously described [3] and for western blot characterization of the product isolated from the bacterial pellets.",

N1, N2 and N3 correspond to RHDV capsid proteins lacking various numbers of amino-acid residues at the N-terminal end. Proteins N1 and N2 lacked the first 42 and 75 amino acids respectively. These two proteins were designed so as to determine more precisely the number of residues that could be deleted from the N-terminal end of the protein without preventing self-assembly. The N3 protein lacked the 62 amino acids between residues 31 and 93 in the RHDV immunodominant region described by Martinez-Torrecuadrada et al. (1998) [9] . All modified capsid genes inserted into baculovirus were verified by PCR amplification and sequencing. No modification or mutation with respect to the predicted sequence was identified. We determined the titers of the recombinant baculoviruses, which were then used to infect cells at a m.o.i. of 5 pfu/cell. We investigated the efficient production of recombinant capsid proteins by immunofluorescence with the anti-RHDV MAbs E3, A47, C36, E29, which have been described elsewhere [7] ( Table 1) . We also evaluated the production of recombinant proteins by western blotting with MAbA47 (Fig. 4) . All the new recombinant capsid proteins included the MAb A47 epitope and were recognized, whereas no signal was detected with the negative control, Bac+, corresponding to AcRP6-Sc lysate. The signals obtained with the N1 and N2 proteins seemed to be stronger than those obtained with the N3 protein and the positive control, corresponding to the entire VP60 (BacG320), possibly demonstrating a better production efficiency of N1 and N2. The observed molecular masses of all of the proteins detected were as predicted (Fig. 1) . The N1, N2 and N3 proteins were also immunoprecipitated with MAb E3 and, as in western blots, the molecular mass of the protein immunoprecipitated was as predicted ( Table 1) .",

Our results with the chimeric proteins RE and ER, composed of regions of the RHDV and EBHSV capsid proteins, were consistent with this hypothesis. MAb E3, which binds specifically to an external conformational epitope on RHDV capsid protein dimers [7, 17] , bound the ER protein but not the RE protein, demonstrating that the exposed E3 epitope is constituted from sequences located in the C-terminal half of the RHDV protein. MAb A47, which binds an internal epitope of RHDV [7] , recognized the RE protein and not the ER protein, implying that the A47 epitope is located in the N-terminal part of the protein. We mapped precisely the A47 epitope with the pGEX expression system to a 31 aa length peptide between residues 129 and 160 of the VP60. This epitope is located in the immunodominant region described by Martinez-Torrecuadrada et al. (1998) [9] . Our results confirm that the N-terminal part of the RHDV capsid protein is buried within the particle whereas the C-terminal part is exposed. They were obtained by biochemical and immunological approaches and were consistent with the results obtained in studies of the X-ray crystallographic structure of Norwalk virus VLPs [14] . However, the two subdomains, P1 and P2, that subdivide the P domain of the Norwalk capsid, have not yet been shown to exist in the RHDV capsid protein. In the Norwalk virus capsid, the P1 subdomain consists of 166 residues including the first and last residues of the P domain whereas the P2 subdomain, located at the surface of the capsid, consists of the remaining 127 residues of the P domain. In this context, fine mapping of the E3 epitope would be of value to characterize and to localize the potential P2 domain on the RHDV capsid protein.",

The N1 protein self-assembled, demonstrating that the first 42 amino acids were not essential for the self-assembly of VLPs. In contrast, a larger deletion corresponding to the first 75 amino acids prevented assembly as N2 formed no particles. Nagesha et al. (1999) [10] produced VLPs with a truncated RHDV protein lacking the first 30 amino-acid residues, fused to a foreign epitope. Our work extends the domain known not to be required for self-assembly by 12 residues. The VLPs produced by Nagesha et al. (1999) were small whereas the VLPs we obtained with the N1 protein were similar to the VLPs produced with entire rRHDV protein. It is possible that the foreign peptide inserted into the VLPs produced by Nagesha et al. (1999) affected the RHDV capsid protein, leading to capsid misassembly, whereas the VLPs obtained from capsid protein with a straightforward deletion may have assembled like native VLPs (data not shown by the authors). The N3 protein we produced, in which the 62 amino acids between positions 31 and 93 had been deleted, also self-assembled into small VLPs. Thus, in the N-terminal part of the RHDV protein, amino acid composition, the original location of the sequence deleted, and the foreign sequence inserted seem to affect the folding and assembly of the capsid protein as much as the length of the sequence deleted.",

However, their characteristics differ from those of the core-like particle (CLPs) isolated from RHDV samples corresponding to assembly of the N-terminal region of the RHDV protein into small smooth particles [1] . So, like Nagesha et al. (1999) , we suggest that the 27 nm VLPs were constructed from 60 RHDV capsid dimers (rather than the 90 present in a normal particle), forming particles of T = 1 symmetry similar to the Norwalk VLPs isolated in the baculovirus system [19] . It is unlikely that the small particles correspond to CLPs because MAb E3 bound N3, demonstrating that at least the part of the C-terminal end of the protein containing the MAb E3 epitope was present in the small particle. The misassembly of capsid particles from T = 3 normal symmetry to T = 1 has also been reported for other icosahedral viruses with capsids composed of a single protein and, in all cases, T = 1 particles are produced if the N-terminal residues of the capsid are deleted or disordered [19, 21] .",

Fusion of a foreign sequence to the N-terminal end of the RHDV capsid protein presents advantage that the foreign peptide is buried inside the VLPs. For gene transfer, this facilitates the packaging and protection of the DNA within the particle. The insertion of the DNA packaging sequence of a human papillomavirus at the N terminus of the N1 protein has already been tested with success [4] , with the production of VLPs able to transfer DNA to several cell lines. For use as an epitope carrier, the internal location of the foreign epitope protects it from proteolysis. Furthermore, studies of the antigenic structure of the RHDV capsid protein have demonstrated that an immunodominant domain of the RHDV capsid protein is localized in the N terminal part of the protein [9, 18] . Thus, the foreign epitope fused to N1 or N3 protein would be present in a region that would increase the immunogenicity of the peptide. Further investigations are required to test the immunogenicity of foreign epitopes fused to the N1 and N3 proteins and to identify other suitable domains for deletion, especially in the C-terminal part of the protein, to improve the efficiency of these VLPs as epitope carriers.",
