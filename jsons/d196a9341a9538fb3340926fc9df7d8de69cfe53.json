Intense distribution has been shown to be a key to success for convenience goods (e.g., Coughlan et al. 2006 ) and durables (e.g., Bucklin et al. 2008 for cars) which are targeted at large consumer segments, just as commercial (and many \"independent\") entertainment products also are. 366 That is why we consider access to distribution channels to be a critical strategic resource for entertainment companies, by the way. An exception might be in those distribution channels in which \"shelf space\" is rare and costly, as is the case with physical venue distribution-every empty seat in a movie theater on a Friday night is irredeemably lost. For those channels, if a new product is distributed too widely, such oversupply can threaten the product's availability in the following weeks and months, as theaters drop such films in favor of more lucrative offerings-see our discussion of the niche concept of integrated entertainment marketing. 367 In this chapter, we look beyond the mere intensity of product availability and which might be the \"right\" distributors for an entertainment product. Instead, we focus on three other distribution issues that are of key importance for an entertainment product's success. The first is timing the new product release. Timing deserves particular attention because entertainment life cycles are usually short, the consumer motivation for spending money on entertainment is hedonic (the time must be \"right\" for entertainment fun), and entertainment markets are crowded and competitive. We will discuss both the absolute timing of launching a new product and the timing relative to that of competitors.",

            "text": "Second, because books, music, games, and movies are all information goods and thus can be made available in pure digital format, broadband Internet technology has dramatically increased the number of potential distribution channels for entertainment. Coordinating these channels is tough, particularly with regard to the timing dimension: when should a specific distribution channel be opened and closed? When should the next channel be opened? 366 To avoid misunderstandings: for some mainly artistic entertainment products, being available via a maximum number of distributors is not the essence, but rather getting access to the \"right\" ones. But distributors are often the same for commercial and independent products (e.g., Spotify, Amazon), and few producers of artistic products would refuse being successful beyond their core niche target segment, so that in the end, the wider their products are available the better. Things are somewhat different for the theatrical movie channel (and other forms of venue distribution), as we discuss in the text. 367 In a study of \"film survival\" at the level of the individual movie theater, Chisholm and Norman (2006) offer rich insights into theater owners' strategic decisions based on 2000/2001 data from 13 movie theaters in the Boston area. Their results provide strong evidence that theaters indeed base their decisions on a film's (relative) performance in the previous week.",

At the point of greenlighting an idea, producers need to have an eye on multiple factors that, at a much later time, will surround the introduction of the product and influence its reception by consumers. Knowing and understanding these factors allows the producer to vary the speed of the innovation process (to accelerate it or to slow it down) to meet the \"right\" window in time, but also to completely abandon a project if he or she senses that this window is closed and won't re-open in the foreseeable future. What are these factors that determine a market's readiness for a new entertainment product within a time window? We name technology, infrastructure, cultural trends, and the state of the economy.",

Before 2009, the number of screens that could show a film in digital 3D was too small to make this format a nationwide success; distribution infrastructure was a limiting factor, a price that several early 3D productions (such as Warner's The Polar Express) had to involuntarily pay. The producers of Avatar timed their release perfectly-2009 was the first year in which sufficient 3D distributive capacity was available in major markets, a development that was at least in part endogenous, being driven by the strong buzz that the film makers were able to create for their film. 368 Relatedly, ambitious serialized stories, such as House of Cards and The Get Down, have a much higher success potential these days because of technological advances such as broadband Internet connections. It is the wide availability of this technology and its adoption by consumers that allow consumers to indulge in on-demand binge watching and to follow the series' complex, horizontal, episode-spanning storytelling; the infrastructure serves as the foundation of the rise of services such as Netflix and Spotify. 368 Please see our coverage of empirical findings on the link between 3D technology and product success and the critical role of time in Chapter 8 on entertainment search qualities.",

The script for the western movie Unforgiven was written in 1976. It was purchased by Clint Eastwood in 1983, who then delayed transforming it into a film for almost a decade (Schickel 1996) . Mr. Eastwood, an artist, did not offer analytical arguments except that he felt \"too young\" to portray the lead character. But his decision corresponded with the insight that the revisionist nature of the story felt much more timely in the 1990s, when westerns had become a rarity for both for the actor and Hollywood in general. Only in such a modern cultural environment, this film could be appreciated for looking back on the now defunct genre and reflecting on its na\u00efve stereotypes, providing an explanation of its demise, and also as a revision of Mr. Eastwood's own (now long \"retired\") historic western persona known for its violence. The film became a major commercial hit and also won the Oscar for best picture in 1992. 369 Finally, the hedonic nature of entertainment and its underlying \"pleasure principle\" imply that demand for entertainment is also influenced by a society's economic conditions.

The elasticity of consumer sentiment is \u22120.32: a 10% decrease in sentiment leads to an increase in movie demand of about 3%, on average.

Seasonal sales patterns not only differ between forms of entertainment and product types, but can also do so between countries. Panel B of Fig. 13 .2 illustrates that a seasonal pattern exists for movie attendance in Germany too, but the pattern clearly differs from its North American counterpart. Instead of the summer peak found for North America, we note a summer dip in Germany, where June and July are the months with the lowest average movie attendance. Obviously, German and North American consumers decide differently when they have to trade off the cool darkness of a movie theater for sunshine. Managers need to take note of such cultural differences in sales patterns instead of applying an ethnocentric perspective.",

Back then, Hollywood studios \"viewed the hot weather months as a time when people were too busy traveling or frolicking outdoors and not typically inclined to go to the movies\" (Canning 2010, p. 531) . 371 So why was Jaws, the expensive inaugural \"blockbuster\" movie, 372 released in the summer, if it was considered a low-demand period? Not because of a manager's vision, but because of an accident: the movie was scheduled to be released in the winter of 1974, but ran over time and budget, and Universal, the producing studio, was too impatient to wait another 6 months to get reimbursed by moviegoers.",

Keep in mind that if everyone in the industry uses the same seasonal heuristic, \"high-demand\" seasons will face heavy competition, whereas there will be much less competition in what is widely regarded as \"low-demand\" seasons. In fact, there are a number of indicators that point to the existence of such supply-side effects. Figure 13 .2 also displays deviations in the box office for the exact same week over the 2010-2014 period, and it is probable that these variations, which are quite strong for several weeks, were caused by the products that were released in the respective periods in a given year. Take the example of what happened when Disney released Star Wars: The Force Awakens at Christmas in 2015: the sequel broke all records and set a new all-time opening weekend record, generating $248 million in North America in its first three days (more than six times the previous record). Isn't it fascinating that the Christmas timing was once more the result of a production delay-the film was originally scheduled to be released in May, just like all six previous Star Wars films (Child 2013) . 373 Liran Einav (2007) conducted an in-depth investigation of seasonal effects, aimed at the difficult separation of demand-side and supply-side effects. Using a data set of almost 2,000 movies that were released in North American theaters between 1985 and 1999, he estimated a nested logic demand model to separate the part of success that can be attributed to the movie characteristics that determine the commercial appeal of a film (such as the production budget, advertising spending, and genres) from the \"true\" underlying demand effect. His findings, which he corroborates with several robustness analyses, provide evidence of the existence of supply-side effects-and that their size is managerially relevant. Specifically, he estimates that about one-third of the seasonal variation in movie ticket sales in his data is caused by the kinds of movies that managers choose to show at a given point in time.",

The industry has recently followed suit and now tends to release its blockbuster productions that have been traditionally considered \"summer fare\" in a more flexible way, and the sales numbers offer external validity for Einav's findings.

For example, we have shown that the value of awards can differ depending on release timing; movies that win an Oscar benefit financially from that win when released at the right time of the year. This means that awards moderate the season-success link: for Oscar contenders, the average financial advantage of a fall release will be higher than for movies that have no chance at winning an award. Movie producers thus have to balance these effects with more general demand-sided considerations regarding timing. Seasonal timing has also been shown to interact with advertising. We have reported earlier that Luan and Sudhir (2010) found that the effectiveness of advertising for a movie on DVD varies strongly with the release timing; consumers are more sensitive to advertising in high demand seasons (i.e., the holidays, Valentine's Day). This means that the economic attractiveness of releasing an entertainment product at such a point in time can be increased by high levels of advertising spending-or, vice versa, there is additional value in releasing a film that is targeted for strong advertising support in a high-demand period.",

A widely used empirical approach here is to study the correlations between a program's viewership ratings and those of the show that precedes it. Research usually reveals significant associations (e.g., Tiedge and Ksobiech 1986 , in a study of almost 1,000 prime-time series aired during 1963-1984, find an average correlation of 0.49). But causality is once more unclear-TV managers may incorporate the effect into their decisions and choose attractive shows to lead consumers into watching other attractive shows. Wilbur (2008) , while not fully accounting for the endogeneity bias caused by managers' decision heuristics, includes a program's lead-in audience in his regression to explain the program's market share, controlling for several other program and network characteristics. He finds that the lead-in parameter is significant, as also is a \"lead-out\" parameter (by which he intends to capture the attractiveness of the subsequent show). Similar short-term timing effects exist for music played on the radio. Some days (weekdays) and hours (morning and meal times) are more attractive to consumers than others (weekends and evenings). Thus, radio consumption peaks early in the day (in Germany around 7am on weekdays and around 9am on weekends) and declines continuously, dropping to very low levels by the early evening (e.g., Gattringer and Klingler 2014) . Lees and Wright (2013) provide evidence that \"inheritance\" effects also matter in this medium in a study using radio diaries by more than 1,000 consumers in New Zealand; we assume that their findings should hold for most other Western markets.",

For this situation, Krider and Weinberg deduce from their analysis that the same release pattern is still optimal for the (marginally) stronger film, but brings suboptimal results for the weaker movie. It is nevertheless likely to occur because the weaker movie has more to lose than the stronger one. Krider and Weinberg argue the situation constitutes what game theory refers to as a \"chicken game.\" They compare it with a situation in which a Volkswagen van and a Greyhound bus are careening toward a head-on collision: whereas both vehicles will lose time when avoiding the other, and although each vehicle swerving would result in a stable situation, the Volkswagen has a higher probability of swerving because its driver is more likely to lose in a collision. Thus \"the weaker movie, analogous to the Volkswagen, is most likely to delay its opening\" (p. 8)-to swerve, so to speak. 379 In a follow-up study, Einav (2010) builds on his separation of demand and supply effects on timing decisions for movies and develops a game-theoretical model of competitive distribution timing decisions, empirically analyzing what he calls the \"movie release timing game.\" He uses the same set of films released between 1985 and 1999 as in his earlier study, this time combining it with release data announcements from film producers, as reported by Exhibitor Relations in their \"Feature Release Schedule\" report. 379 The scholars also reflect on what can be expected to happen when both movies are equally liked by consumers, having similarly high playability. In this case, Krider and Weinberg conclude that it would be best for both movies to open at the same time, and early in the \"season,\" so that their playability potentials can be fully realized. This finding might deserve a second look, though, when taking into account the lesser-than-usually argued differences in consumer demand between different release dates as reported by Einav (2007) .",

Among the almost 2,000 films in Einav's (2010) data set, the release date was changed for more than 20% of them. Most of these changes are short-term; only for about 5% of the films was the release date changed by more than five weeks (earlier or later).

For example, you can buy train tickets at a travel agent, at the train company's physical outlet, via an online site, at a kiosk at the station, or from the conductor on the train. Multi-channel availability is also true for most entertainment products. But something is quite different for entertainment products versus train tickets: the different channels of distribution are not simply gateways to the exact same consumption experience, but they are often linked to a unique entertainment format. A train ride remains the same, regardless of through which channel the consumer purchased the ticket. But watching a movie in a theater is not quite the same as watching it on DVD or in streaming format. Each is a different format or mode of consumption for which consumers have differing preferences: some prefer the darkness of the theater, others the convenience of the living room. This is what we have in mind when we talk about distribution channels in the following pages. Each kind of entertainment content we discuss in this book was originally made available commercially in a single format only: films in theaters, music on vinyl discs, 382 novels on printed paper, and games on machines in mall arcades or bars. Since then, technological developments, and particularly the recent advances in the digital connectivity of consumers, have made alternative formats possible for all those contents. Entertainment has been critical toward new technologies and formats from the very beginning (the introductory quotes in this section bear witness of this quite conservative attitude), but that has not slowed the popularity of the new formats with consumers, usually to the industry's own advantage.",

We will then cover empirical studies of sequential distribution which help explain how changes in the traditional distribution models would affect the industry, and who would win the most (and who might lose).

For example, book publishers and retailers have had only limited dispute over the time gap between the release of hardcover and paperback versions of printed books. But when different formats are offered through different distributors, the producer's profit maximization efforts can impact those distributors differently, fueling the flames of conflict. This is why the history of sequential distribution has known some fierce battles. Consider the case of movies: whereas theater owners distribute films in their theatrical format and (only) earn profits from the corresponding revenues, retailers (or rental firms or streaming providers) capture the margins when a film is distributed through them in a home entertainment format: the traditional theater does not get anything when a film is a hit in DVD format. Theater owners thus aim for configurations that maximize theatrical revenues, whereas home entertainment distributors look for a maximization of the revenues that are generated via their respective home entertainment channel.",

In December 2015, singer Adele released her album 25 on CD and digital download, but not on streaming platforms (Sisario 2015) ; it was eventually made available (seven months later) in that format on Spotify and other streaming platforms. Whereas Adele named personal reasons for the delayed streaming release, 386 the labels studied the performance of her music closely. The results were stunning: the album sold over eight million copies in its release month and about 18 million in its first six months, during which it was not available for streaming (McIntyre 2016).",

In 2017, Universal imposed a general two-week window for its music on the advertising-based streaming of Spotify (Roettgers 2017 ). In addition, streaming providers make attempts to make some music available only through their channel, at least for a certain period, reversing the order that Adele chose-an example is Jay Z's 2017 album 4:44, which was exclusively available on streaming service Tidal for a week before it became accessible in other formats and streaming platforms. 388 Behind most of the windowing practices (both traditional and newer) are managerial assumptions, which, as we know from discussions with various industry managers, are just that-assumptions. The current practices are not grounded in reliable empirical data or solid theories of windowing practices. And the limited empirical tests the studios have conducted use designs that are severely flawed from a methodological standpoint. Often the specific content used prevents generalization, such as in the case of Steven Soderbergh's micro-budgeted, very experimental film Bubble, which was among the first films made available on home entertainment channels at the same time it premiered in theaters (Risen 2005) .",

These aspects are matters of channel power, which we separate from our optimization discussion: we consider it more helpful to first determine the raw effects that any distribution configuration would have for producers if no conflict occurred, essentially applying the ceteris paribus approach. This then gives us a baseline against which producers can judge the costs of a potential conflict: if I know that I would gain $100 million from a different distribution model, I would have more incentive to fight for it than if I know I would gain only $1 million. But our analysis is by no means a call to seek out such channel conflicts: instead, designing channel configurations in a way that addresses consumer interest better should enable the industry to identify models that benefit all parties involved in the creation of entertainment value. But being able to do that requires a better understanding of the mechanisms, which is why we use analytics and theory. 389 Let us now take a closer look at macro-and micro-level forces that we have named in Fig. 13 .5.",

Director Christopher Nolan received applause from many in the movie business when he said about his film Dunkirk: \"[T]he only way to [carry the audience through the film] is through theatrical distribution\" (quoted in Busch 2017). Similar arguments are made for music, where vinyl is often considered by managers to be the \"true\" medium for musical recordings and artists often disrespect streaming-Adele is certainly not alone here.

Looking down on a certain channel because of its low \"cultural esteem\" fails to address changes in consumer preferences. We sense that culture-related arguments often serve as a straw man for reactionary thinking by producers-which is neither adequate nor helpful when it comes to shaping the present and future of entertainment. 391 In reality, consumers' preferences are quite complex.

Netflix reports that three out of four consumers who streamed all seven episodes of drama series Breaking Bad's first season did so in a single session, and that such binge-watching was even higher for seasons 2 and 3 of the show (which had 13 episodes each; Ascharya 2014). 392 Because of these 390 See our discussion of how certain phases in a person's live shape his or her entertainment preferences (e.g., the \"reminiscence bump\") in our chapter on entertainment product characteristics, which also applies to the channels through which entertainment is experienced. 391 Focusing on economic effects of channels and configurations is not the same as ignoring artists' opinions about channels. Instead, managers must be aware that their distribution decisions can also influence the \"supply side\" of the business-the flow of talent that wants to work with them. Thus, there is a certain similarity between the roles of artists and distributors when designing distribution models-their respective attitudes should be considered in conjunction with profitability effects. 392 Who enjoys binging, and on what content? Schweidel and Moe (2016) are among the few scholars to shed light on the phenomenon so far. Based on an analysis of a very heterogeneous set of TV content from streaming provider Hulu (including game shows, news, and sports), they suggest that binge watching differs according to consumer traits (i.e., watching patterns), as well as with program characteristics (comedies and drama content are more likely to be \"binged\"). preference dynamics, entertainment producers must regularly update their distribution models. They must do so to strive to achieve profit potentials, but also to avoid threatening the relevance of their content, in general.",

Alternative choices for a person who foregoes a movie might be video games, books, or music; however, they might also turn to completely different forms of entertainment, such as social media (which most consumers today consider as a kind of entertainment on its own; Leggatt 2011) and short videos on YouTube and similar platforms. As Disney-CEO, Bob Iger has pointedly phrased this need to rethink distribution systems: \"if we tried to fight [technological change] or slow it down or do anything at all aimed at deterring its impact on our business, we were going to lose that battle. \u2026 It's imperative .. that we embrace [Internet distribution channels], .. because [that is] where the consumer is today\" (quoted in Ryan 2016) . 393 Country characteristics. We have highlighted differences that exist in the demand for entertainment products between consumers in different cultures and countries more than once in this book. Such differences almost certainly affect consumers' preferences for distribution channels. Some countries, such as France, have a century-old adoration for the institution of movie theaters, whereas in others, such as in many Asian countries, theaters lack this cultural esteem (and history); people there have a stronger inclination to watch films at home. Related to differences in consumer behavior are infrastructure conditions that affect the quality and convenience of entertainment consumption. Streaming a movie is far less fun without a speedy broadband connection, and so consumers' interest in streaming will be lower under that condition. Convenience is tied to the effort that is required to access a channel, so that a customer's usage of a channel or format will depend on its easy availability, such as access to physical theaters, retail stores, and rental outlets. The same logic applies to the ease of having a CD or DVD shipped to the home, or shopping a printed book: if there is a Barnes and Noble Superstore around the corner, printed books will have a higher commercial outlook compared to when retail availability is lacking.",

Their results show that ebook sales decline by more than 40% at U.S. book retailers in each week when a title is not immediately available at Amazon, but weekly sales of print books at Amazon and other retailers do not increase because of the unavailability of the electronic version. In other words, the (un)availability of an ebook format does not make consumers switch to the printed format, suggesting that digital-affine consumers do not really see the formats as substitutes.

            "text": "More recent studies show that online channels can cannibalize physical channels. Kumar et al. (2014) investigate how the unavailability of digital versions of films for rental (VOD) and purchase (Electronic Sell Through, or EST) influences DVD rentals. They made use of a \"blackout\" period for the digital formats (but not the DVD) that existed around 2008-2010 before a film's showing on pay-TV. For a data set of 194 movies aired at that time by the Top 4 pay-cable networks, they find with a SUR analysis that the \"blackout\" increases DVD sales by around 6% per week. 395 People rent the DVD because a movie is not available in a digital format. Yu et al. (2017) study the interplay between Netflix and DVD sales, using Netflix's decision to no longer list 128 movies from Paramount, Lionsgate, and MGM in 2015 as a \"natural experiment\" (the films were picked up by less popular streaming service Hulu instead). A difference-in-difference model finds that from months 2 through 6 after content becomes unavailable at the streaming service, DVD sales of the films increase by 25%, on average. They calculate that this translates into an increase of about $600,000 in retail sales (about 60% of which, or $360,000, would have flowed back to the studio). Splitting the data set showed that availability on Netflix affected only more-recent titles and box office hits; for recent titles, the DVD sales increase averaged about 60%. Some additional insights on cannibalization from streaming options can be derived from a study by Ananthakrishnan et al. (2016) . The scholars do not use actual SVOD consumption data, but use the free availability of episodes of the hit series Downton Abbey on TV station PBS' website and look how such availability (which can be compared to the \"gratis\" nature of Netflix content for the service's subscribers) influences the digital EST sales of the series. Using a fixed-effects regression, Ananthakrishnan et al. provide evidence that when PBS made Downton Abbey episodes available for a limited time frame in 2014, EST sales of those episodes of the series shrank by an average of 8.4%.",

The physical DVD format, which contains whole seasons of a show, is not seen as a substitute for the digital show format (which is sold episode-by-episode) by most consumers. In Kumar et al.'s study of the \"blackout\" period of digital movie formats, they also look at DVD sales-and find them to benefit much less than DVD rentals from the unavailability of digital formats. 397 Obviously, consumers switch more easily when it comes to renting a movie then buying one. 396 See Barnes (2007) for background information on NBC's content withdrawal. The authors also looked at whether the withdrawal affected illegal downloads-see our discussion of piracy later in this chapter. 397 In a joint model with DVD sales and rentals, the \"blackout\" effect is 10% compared to the 6% when only DVD rentals are studied.

We dedicated a whole section of this book to such action-based cascades, or SBS effects, and we recommend that managers revisit that section before making distribution decisions. In essence, the existence of SBS effects implies that the performance of an entertainment product in an earlier channel can send a signal to consumers about the existence or quality of the product, helping the product's performance in subsequent channels. 398 If a product is released simultaneously in multiple channels, such an effect between channels will be limited or non-existent. Gong et al. (2015) find a positive spillover effect in a study of two transactional digital channels for movies (i.e., EST purchases and VOD rentals), although it does not stem from a film's success in one channel, but from a marketing measure in the other channel. The scholars conduct a 14-week field experiment to analyze how EST price reductions for 233 \"catalogue\" studio movies (i.e., excluding the most commercial titles) affect rental revenues. The results of a fixed effects negative binomial regression 399 show that reducing a movie's retail price increases rental revenues for the respective film by between 2 and 9%. Gong et al. attribute this to a \"positive informational spillover effect\" between the channels, i.e., price discounts for sales offers increase awareness of a product in a rental channel.",

For music albums, about half of the consumers who buy an album on vinyl have already listened to it through an online channel, such as digital streaming, which suggests that vinyl sales benefit from an album's availability in digital channels (The Economist 2017). For movies, Smith and Telang (2009) find that movies' DVD sales can profit from airings of the movies on free-TV. The scholars analyze DVD sales for 522 movies that were aired on over-the-air and free cable TV in the U.S. during an eight-month period in 2005-2006. Using a weekly fixed-effects regression, the scholars find a significant increase in DVD sales at Amazon.com that begins in the week a film is aired and lasts for two to three weeks. 400 Thus, watching a film on TV stimulates consumers to buy its DVD, with the effect being substantial: DVD sales increase by up to 120% (for terrestrial broadcasts) and almost 30% (for cable), on average, in the airing week, before declining afterward. Does this mean that movies should be aired earlier to stimulate home entertainment revenues? No-because the results are only valid under the conditions in which the data was gathered, they inform us that DVD sales benefit from TV airings when several years have passed since the movies were originally released.

These problems are avoided by studies that have made the modeling of complex channel configurations the focus of their work, using insights from lab experiments to shed light on the effectiveness of channel options that have not been used in industry practice. We combined experimental insights and analytical modeling with data from a representative survey of 1,770 consumers in three countries (the U.S., Germany, and Japan) in an attempt to study simultaneously the various effects at play in complex entertainment channel systems (Hennig-Thurau et al. 2007a) .",

For the three countries we studied, we found configurations that promised between 11.6% and 16.2% higher revenues. In other words, considering alternative distribution models indeed bears the potential for substantial revenue increases for producers of entertainment. \u2022 Optimal distribution configurations for producers varied strongly between countries-and probably still do. The best scenario for a producer in the U.S. was a simultaneous release in theaters, DVD rental, and EST, 406 followed by a DVD sales release just three months later. In Fig. 13 .6, we report the resulting effects for producers (as well as the different distributors) and contrast them with the results for Germany-where the ideal model was an exclusive theatrical release, followed by a DVD retail release three months later, with another nine-month wait before a film is released on DVD rental and VOD. Consumer preferences regarding channels vary between countries, and channel solutions need to acknowledge such heterogeneity. But we acknowledge that having different distribution patterns in different parts of the world carries its own challenges, given that in today's digital age, entertainment travels fast between continents. \u2022 In all the revenue-maximizing configurations for producers, at least one distributor faced shrinking revenues, and sometimes these losses would be substantial. The figure shows that in the simultaneous release scenario in the U.S., theaters would lose more than 40% of their revenues; in the producer-optimal German scenario, theaters would gain, but DVD rental would have shrunk by almost a third. 405 Specifically, using prevailing industry averages at the time, we assumed that producers would get a 50% share of theater revenues (the remaining 50% remain with the theater owner), 60% of DVD sales revenues (40% remain with the DVD retailer), 40% of DVD rental revenues (and 60% remain with the DVD rental company), and 50% of EST revenues (with the other half remaining with the Internet company). 406 Please keep in mind that our results reflect a time when consumer preferences for watching movies via the Internet were quite low (below 5% in importance).",

For the U.S., a three-month window between theaters and DVD retail, followed by another three-month delay before a film becomes available on DVD rental and VOD, would increase the producer revenues by 7% (compared to the baseline constellation) without harming theaters. Studying the development of the market over the last decade, it seems to us that the film industry is moving toward the adoption of this type of compromise model. But compromises, by definition, require some players to forgo an even more profitable constellation for a greater good. This implies that the system will experience instability, because who doesn't want a greater slice of the pie? The main insight from our study is that adjusting channel configurations carries the potential for higher revenues for entertainment producers-and is thus a worthwhile endeavor. At the same time, the implications of changes are extremely multifaceted and cannot be anticipated intuitively, given the complexity of the many forces at play. Given the probably hard-to-reverse consequences, changes should be evaluated thoroughly by producers and their distribution partners, with rigorous analyses. Whereas our results were robust under the assumptions of the study, 407 our approach leaves out some aspects; the influence of illegal channels on a channel configuration's optimality is certainly a notable one. In a partial extension and update of our study, Burmester et al. (2016) added illegal file-sharing to the options a consumer faces when deciding whether, and through which channel, to consume an entertainment product. In addition to theater visits, DVD sales and rentals, and EST they also consider two more legal channels that have gained popularity since we conducted our study: VOD (i.e., digital rentals of movies) and Blu-ray purchases; they also offer the choice between high and low definition for VOD offers. Their revenue model, however, is a simplified version that leaves out several of the key forces we discussed earlier, and the authors take an industry perspective (producer plus distributors), not a producer's perspective on channel effects. 408 When not accounting for illegal channels, the scholars find for a sample of about 2,500 German movie consumers that the channel configuration that maximizes revenues for the industry is a parallel release of a film in movie theaters, DVD purchases, and VOD (for a high price of 30 Eurothe equivalent of what the industry terms \"premium VOD\" these days). But Burmester et al.'s results are biased toward a faster release across channels because they do not account for repeated purchases or SBS effects. And does the inclusion of an illegal channel alter the results much? The scholars' answer is no: although theater visits and DVD purchase prices should be somewhat lower in such an environment (but the channels still should be made available at the same time), and VOD rentals should be introduced one month later, file sharing tends to affect every channel similarly. Burmester et al. also apply their approach to books, facing the same limitations.",

Not too much value should be put on the specific results of existing studies, as they do not fully reflect the current realities facing entertainment consumers (think of subscription streaming).

Should a product be released simultaneously across the world (as it is usually done with games and music), or sequentially (as it is often the case with movies and books)? With cannibalization being less of an issue between (most) countries versus between channels (\"geoblocking\" and languages help managers to limit inter-country substitution), a key element of this problem is the existence of SBS effects between countries-something we already addressed in some detail in the communication chapter of this book. Because entertainment products are information goods, they can be duplicated at relatively low costs. Whereas this carries massive economic advantages for their producers (who can extend supply quickly and globally, realizing enormous economies of scale), it also comes at a price: an incentive for others who do not have the legal right to copy the product to benefit from its duplication. This includes bootleggers and consumers, a distinction that is often blurred as the rights of the consumers are somewhat unclear for duplicating an entertainment product.",

Since then, producers of entertainment have long complained about copyright violations and have tried to minimize user rights, arguing that duplicates hurt the financial viability of producers and, thus, threaten any creative industry, as a whole. Consumers and their advocates, in contrast, argue that copyright should not restrict consumers' rights of usage (for example, producing backups for your own use of a product you paid for, reselling it, or lending it to a friend).

Instead of helping the industry in its fight against piracy, perhaps such numbers do the industry a disservice as they call the industry's credibility into question by journalists and consumers (see, for example, blogger Masnick 2016). Scholars, driven by academic curiosity versus commercial interests, have also investigated the piracy phenomenon and yielded rich insights regarding piracy. In the following, we first summarize what scholarly studies have found about the link between piracy and the use of legal channels and industry revenues, before we then offer insights on the drivers of entertainment piracy and, relatedly, the effectiveness of anti-piracy measures. 409 Why then do some argue that piracy is growing, instead of shrinking (e.g., Steele 2015)? We speculate that this is mostly because presenting piracy as an essential threat serves their agenda; in a world that is fixated on growth, financial, political, and societal support would be much harder to get for a phenomenon of shrinking importance. Their empirical arguments usually refer not to the number of files pirated, but to the volume of data that is exchanged via pirate sites. This volume has indeed been growing-but such growth can be attributed more to the much larger file sizes of today's pirated copies versus those which were shared a decade ago. Just consider the development of storage media since the beginning of digital piracy: whereas early, low-resolution rips of films were between 1 and 3 gigabytes (GB) in size, the availability of high-definition versions increased the file size to about 8 GB, and 4K versions are even around 4.5 times that size.",

Because music involvement drives both legal and illegal behaviors (which tends to inflate the piracy effect due to endogeneity), scholars have used instrumental variables (which should facilitate file sharing, but not affect legal consumption) 411 instead of the raw amount of illegal consumption.

Among those is Stan Liebowitz (2008) , who studied the change in cumulative album sales per consumer between 1998 and 2003 in about 100 Nielsen-defined geographic areas. He combined sales data with each area's Internet penetration, as a measure for the amount of file sharing in the area. 412 Liebowitz finds that sales and Internet penetration are strongly linked and estimates that the attractions of the Internet are responsible for an average decline of 1.55 albums sold per consumer in 2003. But how much of that effect can be attributed to illegal activities such as file sharing? Comparing album sales with changes of other non-Internet-based media activities (such as TV consumption), Liebowitz estimates that about 76% of that decline (or 1.19 albums) are caused by file sharing.",

When Rob and Waldfogel (2007) collect information in the spring and summer of 2005 from 470 students in two rounds of surveys, they find that the degree to which piracy cannibalizes paid consumption depends on when piracy happens-if piracy is the first channel through which a consumer experiences a film, a pirated viewing costs about 80% of the average paid viewing of a film. For their sample, they calculate that paid movie consumption, across legal channels, would have been about 3.5% higher-but only 5% of movie viewings happened via file sharing in their sample, which limits the generalizability of this calculation. 414 In a study we conducted ourselves in 2006, we ensured generalizability by employing a representative quota sample of 1,075 (German) consumers (Hennig-Thurau et al. 2007b) . We surveyed them three times over the course of eight months, tracking their legal and illegal consumption behaviors over the life cycle of 25 movies that were released in theaters and on DVD during that time frame. 415 We asked about both consumption intentions and actual behaviors regarding the movies; when doing so, we carefully avoided any moral or legal judgments. These steps contributed to a much higher, and more realistic, number of \"unpaid\" consumption experiences than in Rob and Waldfogel's study (i.e., 17% prior to DVD release) . To determine whether file sharing had an effect on legal channels, we then ran logistic regressions for each legal channel and movie, in which we included the file sharing intentions and movie characteristics, such as the number of theaters in which a film was released and its quality rating by IMDb users. 416 So, what did we find? File sharing substantially hurt legal consumption, and did so not only for theaters, but also for DVD sales and DVD rental. Simulations show that in the absence of illegal channels (and corresponding 414 In addition to the convenience sample, another factor limiting the study's generalizability was that the participants had to recall a period of three years of movie watching, which probably caused a potential memory bias. 415 770 of the respondents participated in all three survey rounds. 416 Specifically, we used ReLogit regression-a specific variation of logistic regressions which accounts for the large number of zeros (non-viewings) in our data set. intentions to use them), theater revenues would have been almost 13% higher, DVD sales would have been almost 15% higher, and DVD rental revenues would have gained more than 10.5%. Figure 13 .7 also shows the corresponding annual dollar amounts for the German market (in 2007 value), which are substantial. Interestingly, we find that it is not mainly the actual file sharing that cannibalizes revenues-instead, the consumers' intentions to watch a free copy of a movie are responsible for the majority of the financial loss attributed to piracy, regardless of whether the consumer actually follows through accessing the illegal copy.",

The first application of a utility perspective to piracy traces back to French scholars Rochelandet and Le Guel (2005) , who applied the utility logic to music consumption. They used logistic regression and found that, among other factors, moral costs a consumer faces lower the likelihood of file sharing, whereas his or her Internet skills (which lower the consumer's transaction costs to engage in piracy) increase it. We extended their ideas into a consumer utility framework of piracy, introducing a set of categories that determine consumers' utility perceptions of legal and pirated formats and, subsequently, consumers' piracy behavior (Hennig-Thurau et al. 2007b ).

Using partial least squares, we analyzed how each of the proposed drivers of file sharing is associated with consumers obtaining and watching an illegal movie copy.

Note that we collected our data before legal digital copies and archives were available, namely subscription services such as Netflix, which provide a consumer with instant access to large numbers of films. And we see that piracy can be an act of protest; the more critical people's attitudes are toward the film industry and its treatment of consumers, the more they are willing to circumvent its legal offers. Finally, the results confirm our argument that the more consumers consider an illegal format as a \"full substitute\" (versus an imperfect knock-off), the more they tend to prefer it over the legal format. Overall, our model explains about 20% of file sharing intentions, leaving room for more in-depth studies. Watson et al.

When digital formats for storing entertainment such as MP3 became available by the late 1990s, the industry was hesitant to use them out of a desire to avoid spoiling the existing value chain of formats and channels. Consequently, fully digital formats of entertainment products were only available illegally, a condition that is widely considered a major reason for the collapse of music sales. With the exception of video games, traditional entertainment producers remained hesitant for many years to foster new digital formats, such as legal downloads and VOD, that would provide consumers with the same utility to which they had become accustomed from illegal competitors.",

Apple provided songs and albums (and later movies) for sale via iTunes from 2001 on, Spotify began to offer a legal music flat rate, and Netflix popularized legal streaming of films and series. All these offers were considered valuable by consumers with regard to price and quality, but they also copied the benefits of the illegal offers (e.g., access via the Internet, anytime access to large repertoires in the case of Spotify and Netflix). It was only afterward that the studios embraced such formats, and some still do so only halfheartedly. So, although we describe this rise of new entertainment formats as a \"strategy,\" let us note that it was one that was mostly forced upon the industry's traditional players rather than being actively originated by them.",

Using a BitTorrent tracker to measure piracy over time, Brett Danaher and his colleagues treated NBC's content removal as a natural experiment and used the content's availability on iTunes for explaining the number of daily illegal downloads. An OLS regression, in which the scholars control for the changes in piracy for other content in the same time period (whose availability on iTunes did not change) reveals that piracy of NBC content increased by 11.4% in the two weeks after the closure of the legal format-they measured 48,000 additional illegal downloads per day. And that number is not the upper limit: for certain kinds of content, such as comedy and sci-fi, which appeal mostly to younger, more piracy-affine consumers, the increase is as high as 20%.",

This economic logic also applies directly to file sharing networks: an increase in the attractiveness of legal formats reduces the attractiveness of illegal formats by shrinking the illegal network in terms of the people who make content available, limiting the number of available pirated copies of a product.

In the case of DRM, however, the target is not the platform through which illegal content can be distributed for free, but the consumer who has paid to access entertainment content legally. DRM restricts the consumer's own usage of the obtained content to prevent others from accessing the content without paying for it. DRM can either take the form of limiting the number of devices on which a song can be heard or a film can be played (i.e., \"individual\" DRM) or the consumer's ability to distribute the purchased content to others, such as by limiting the number of shares (i.e., \"shared\" DRM).

The scholars find particularly strong effects for \"shared\" DRM, the removal of which not only increases consumers' willingness to pay for digital music, but also turns consumers from pirates into paying consumers of legal music formats.

A final approach to deal with piracy is strategic (re)targeting: a strategy that has been successfully practiced by producers of console games. Our previous discussion reported only the average importance of piracy determinants across consumers, but the video game industry has built on the assumption that these importances vary between consumer segments. For example, whereas teenagers will be price sensitive (because of small personal budgets) and relatively insensitive toward measures that raise the costs of pirated content, this is not the case for older consumers, who more highly value convenience (and will not engage in piracy if it's inconvenient).",

The evidence is pretty clear that increasing the utility (and/or decreasing the costs) of legal copies is a promising path-one that entertainment firms have neglected for a long time in efforts to protect their traditional channels and which they still seem to be embracing only half-heartedly. These strategies also come with the side benefit of enhancing the entertainment firm's reputation, which further decreases consumers' motivations to pirate their content. Strategies that focus on blocking access to pirated content seem to support such efforts, whereas approaches that reduce the value of the legal product by adding restrictions are not recommended.",
