Upon establishment of goal, diuretic orders were entered, with dose selection based on previous diuretic exposure and baseline renal function. Orders included conditional diuretic orders if shift fluid balance targets were not met, basic metabolic panels, goal parameters, and hold parameters for adverse events (see Additional file 1). Combination diuresis was permitted once the maximum dose of furosemide was reached (200 mg IV) or potential hypernatremia. Available options included metolazone 10 mg oral or chlorothiazide 500 mg IV in instances when no enteral access was available. Indications for continuous infusion diuresis included a lack of response to 200 mg or failure of sustained diuretic response resulting in failure to achieve goal fluid balance.",

Age, gender, insurance type, home county classification, admission source, diagnosis-related group (DRG) weight, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at time of diuresis initiation, baseline serum creatinine prior to first dose of furosemide, pre-diuretic fluid balance, time from ventilator to first diuretic administration, pre-diuretic vasopressor administration, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis were used as matching variables in the distance calculation.

The variables previously correlated with mortality were accounted for in the matching criteria of this cohort. Studies demonstrate that almost ubiquitous organ dysfunction has been associated with positive volume status in the ICU. It is possible that the implication of volume de-resuscitation seen in the current study could be casually linked with mortality, in line with a vast number of previous studies demonstrating the impact of fluid status on survival rates aside of its effect on ventilator days; however, this study can only show correlation given the nature of its design. Particularly, patients in the intervention group also had a decrease in RRT dependence at discharge. RRT receipt prior to hospital discharge has been associated with progression to end stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality [19, 20].",

The protocol modification sought more aggressive potassium replacement; however, nursing adherence was not evaluated. As follow-up potassium evaluations were mandated with protocol implementation, it is possible that incidences of hypokalemia were increased secondary to more frequent monitoring relative to the historical cohort; however, frequency of serum potassium collections were not recorded. In regard to rates of hypernatremia, providers were permitted to request continuation of furosemide despite elevated sodium levels, likely resulting in the subsequent increased rate of metolazone use in the intervention group. There was a significant difference in cumulative fluid balance that was likely due to higher furosemide exposure in the intervention group, as demonstrated in previous protocols of furosemide in acute kidney injury [10]. The significant increase in episodes of hypernatremia and hypokalemia are predictable and reversible within this strategy. If replicated in future randomized trials, improvements in ICU length of stay and mortality may take precedence over concern for electrolyte abnormalities. Future protocol designs should account for these episodes of hypernatremia and hypokalemia with creation of more explicit electrolyte replacement rules. Further, electrolyte derangements may be of greater consideration in an alternative ICU population, including cardiothoracic/cardiology critical care. Patient-specific factors should be taken into consideration with implementation of this protocol.",

A pre- and post-intervention study was chosen given the lack of blinding. It was anticipated that an overall change in practice may occur over the study timeframe given increased awareness of the detrimental effects of fluid overload and approach to diuretic dosing in critically ill patients, a phenomenon recently found in management of septic shock [22, 23]. However, given the limited time lapse between the historical group and protocol implementation and lack of emergence of guidelines regarding volume de-resuscitation, changes in overall approaches to care based on external factors were unlikely. To limit potential bias further, patients were matched on a large number of relevant variables and objective outcome measures were utilized, with the exception of the DRG weight. However, the authors opted for inclusion of this variable versus International Classification of Disease coding given its consideration for up to eight diagnoses, including the primary diagnosis, and up to six procedures performed during the stay, likely increasing its objectiveness versus retrospective chart review. Regardless, it is still possible for potential residual confounders on illness severity to have been missed. Given that volume overload and positive fluid balance may be markers of severity of illness rather than a parameter for early diuresis intervention, the differences in mortality and length of stay must be replicated in a larger, randomized controlled trial for confirmation. Worth nothing, true blinding in a randomized controlled trial would likely be unfeasible by nature of the protocol design and a parallel design could subject the trial to potential for a significant Hawthorne effect.",
