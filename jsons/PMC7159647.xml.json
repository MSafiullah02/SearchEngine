Both morbidity and mortality of calves are not exclusively correlated with colostral immunoglobulin passive transfer in calves, but numerous studies have reported an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in calves with low levels of circulating immunoglobulins (Dewell et al.\n2006; Rea et al.\n1996). Dairy calves with satisfactory passive transfer of immunity have lower pre\u2010weaning morbidity and mortality as well as fewer antibiotic treatments compared with calves with failure of passive transfer (Berge et al.\n2005; Williams et al.\n2014).",

Samples were then centrifuged for 20 min prior to analysis of the IgG\u2010rich supernatant. Refractive indexes were obtained with an automatic digital refractometer (Reichter Technologies, model AR200, Depew, NY, USA) and these values were applied to the following equation: y = 5919.1 x \u2212 7949.1, where y = serum IgG concentration (mg/mL) and x = refractive index of the fractionated supernatant. However, these results are somehow biased by the fact that the above\u2010mentioned equation was derived from the association between serum IgG concentration determined by radial immunodiffusion (RID) and the refractive index of whole calf serum (r = 0.86; Morrill et al.\n2013), but in the present study, the refractive index of the fractionated supernatant was used instead of the whole calf serum, which results in a lower correlation coefficient between these variables (r = 0.77; Morrill et al.\n2013). Samples were assayed in duplicate, with an inter\u2010assay coefficient of variation for IgG concentration (n = 300) of 0.19.

In the present study, pasteurization of colostrum and subsequent freezing and thawing failed to reduce both TBC and TCC, which indicates that the magnitude of bacterial contamination of pasteurized frozen\u2013thawed colostrum is important, with 42% of samples showing counts above 100 000 cfu/mL. Thus, the colostral management practice used in this study was unsuitable for reducing bacterial load. One possible factor influencing the rapid colonization of colostrum by bacteria was the hot weather prevailing during this trial, because colostrum fed during warm months is contaminated more often than is colostrum fed during cold months (Fecteau et al.\n2002). A possible alternative to reduce contamination of pasteurized frozen\u2010thawed colostrum is thawing it in a microwave oven for short periods on low power (Pfeiffer et al.\n2010).",

The total morbidity found for these diseases in the present study is twice the level as that previously reported from temperate areas. The higher incidence of these diseases in the present study might be due to a compromised immune function of calves due to heat stress (both in the uterus during late gestation; Strong et al.\n2015, and in the field; Peli et al.\n2013; Yun et al.\n2014). Calves held under stressful conditions, such as the severe heat experienced in the present study, are more prone to diseases (Cobb et al.\n2014). In addition, the large size of this dairy herd may have contributed to the high prevalence of diseases in calves, because the workload on large farms is associated with less time being available for calf care. The lack of bedding material for calves could be another reason for high morbidity in this herd because the use of bedding decreases the risk of calf pen bacterial counts (Lago et al.\n2006).",

Similar results were observed by Teixeira et al. (2013). Also, Araujo et al. (2015) observed that colostrum with \u2265100 000 cfu/mL did not cause diarrhea in dairy calves. We speculated that colostrum with high total bacterial counts would provide a more substantial source of bacteria for gut colonization and subsequently be reflected in a greater incidence of diarrhea. Also, it was expected that high TCC in colostrum could lead to high endotoxin levels, which might cause harm to neonatal calves, as has been the case in other studies (Moore et al.\n2009). However, this was not observed and indicates that contamination of colostrum following pasteurization and freeze\u2013thawing may provide a less pathogenic source of bacteria for gut colonization. Also, the lack of negative effect of high TBC on the occurrence of diarrhea was likely due to the presence of colostral or blood plasma immunoglobulins, which provide local immunity against several pathogens associated with calf diarrheal disease such as Escherichia coli, coronavirus and rotavirus (Crouch et al.\n2000; Arthington et al.\n2002). Another plausible reason for the absence of effect of highly contaminated colostrum on the occurrence of diarrhea apparently was the inclusion of an antibiotic in the milk replacer. Thus non\u2010therapeutic levels of antibiotic could have had a positive effect on the calf gut microbiota. Other researchers have documented that provision of antibiotics in milk replacer improves weight gain and reduces mortality of dairy calves (Quigley & Drew 2000; Sarker et al.\n2010).",

We conjectured that differences in weight gain might become evident with highly contaminated colostrum because decreased food intake is a characteristic in sick or immune\u2010challenged animals as a response to cytokines released by activated leukocytes (Johnson 1998). Given the large volume of colostrum fed during the first 12 h of life (4.8 L) and the high serum total protein levels 48 h after colostrum feeding in most calves, presumably, calves challenged with high bacterial counts during their first feeding were able to neutralize them, so that weight gain was unaffected. Increased growth rates in preweaning calves are consistent with increased intake of nutrients (Quigley et al.\n2006), thus, it seems that calves fed the highly contaminated colostrum were equally affected in their health as calves fed colostrum with low bacterial counts, and consequently they were not affected in their growth rate.",

Thus, excluding fecal scores, physiological variables used in the physical examination of calves did not provide any guidance in predicting enteric or respiratory illness early in life. This finding does agree with information from Fecteau et al. (1997), who found these variables useless to predict bacteremia (bacteriological culture of blood) from dairy calves. In the current study, feeding colostrum with <85 mg Ig/mL resulted in a decrease in fecal consistency. This response has been observed in calves challenged with coronavirus (Arthington et al.\n2002) and Escherichia coli (Quigley & Drew 2000) infections. Thus, fecal scores are one of several measures of enteric health, but it is important to note that this variable also varies with nutrition, with more loose feces or greater fecal scores with better plane of nutrition (Bartlett et al.\n2006; Ballou et al.\n2015).",

Serum cholesterol levels were higher in calves fed the colostrum with \u2265100 000 TBC.
