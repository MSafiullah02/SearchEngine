The duration of this period and details of the risk remain to be determined. A number of factors such as age and comorbidities will also influence this risk, as will the additional visits to hospital associated with specific treatment [2], [3].",

While we do not recommend suboptimal dosing, if neutropenia occurs the doses need to be reduced for each episode. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended where appropriate. Immunosuppressive agents such as steroids should be avoided or reduced for antiemesis where possible. Prolonged steroid treatment for prostate cancer requires consideration. Agents reducing the incidence of skeletal-related events such as bisphosphonates are probably best postponed if administration of the therapy involves potential exposure to COVID-19 (Table 1\n).",
