As of April 2016, there were 28,652 cases resulting in at least 11,325 deaths, nearly all in the three nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [1]. Moreover, the 2014\u20132016 outbreak was the first in which patients, albeit few in number, were afforded sophisticated intensive care in the United States and in Europe. This \u201chigh-level containment care\u201d (HLCC) was provided in specially designed purpose-built biocontainment units (BCUs). In this chapter , we explore the history and evolution of biocontainment, discuss its unique engineering and infection control modalities, and offer recommendations for the clinical and operational management of Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs).",

In May of that year, Michael Crichton published The Andromeda Strain, and, while the work was clearly fictional, it debuted amidst a series of discussions leading up to President Nixon\u2019s decision in November of that year to abandon the US offensive biological weapons program. Nixon\u2019s decision was a prelude to ratification of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and to the US ratification, in 1975, of the Geneva Protocols. At the time, Nixon stated that \u201cthe United States has decided to destroy its entire stockpile of biological agents and confine its future biological research program to defensive measures.\u201d Implicit in that decision was a shift in the focus of US efforts to defensive and medical countermeasure development that would include an emphasis on the management of patients potentially infected with highly hazardous human pathogens. This medical defense program would fall largely upon the newly created US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), an entity which would inherit its defensive mission from the old Army Biological Laboratory (ABL).",

The facility would receive spacecraft, equipment, and lunar samples from Apollo 11 and from future Apollo missions. Moreover, it would serve as a quarantine facility for the returning astronauts from the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 missions.",

Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and monkeypox in the spring of 2003 added impetus to these construction projects, SARS because of its high mortality and apparent transmission via droplet nuclei and monkeypox owing to a resistance among fearful healthcare providers to treat victims of the disease [6].",

Inclusion of laboratory and waste sterilization capabilities within HLCC units are also key features that help minimize the potential of transmission throughout the hospital [16, 17]. A double door pass through autoclave was identified as mandatory for HLCC unit through both consensus efforts [7, 18].

The number of staff members required for a standard 12 h nursing shift must take into account the time limitations imposed on each staff member due to the use of advanced PPE. When providing the level of intensive care that these patients can require in addition to wearing PPE, it is necessary to adjust shift times and staffing ratios [24]. The staffing matrix utilized within hospitals that successfully cared for EVD patients differed significantly from standard staffing ratios. Within the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, six staff members were present on a day shift and five on the night shift (usually three nurses along with respiratory therapists and/or patient care technicians). Healthcare staff was scheduled for 12 h shifts which were broken up into 4 h blocks to allow for the limitation of not wearing PPE for greater than 3\u20134 h at a time. Designation of roles for each staff member on each shift can clarify expectations and ensure consistency within each role. The use of an autoclave for waste processing may necessitate the inclusion of a dedicated staff member to operate the machine. The Special Communicable Diseases Unit (SCDU) at Emory University utilized two to three nurses to staff the Unit at all times when occupied, and it was recommended that nurses remove (\u201cdoff\u201d) PPE every 4 h to allow for personal needs and a break. At the highest level of PPE and patient care, three nurses were working in the SCDU at one time, in 12-h shifts. They rotated in 4-h shifts between the patient room, the anteroom, and the nursing desk with each having designated responsibilities [20].",

Examples of PPE include items such as gowns, gloves, foot and eye protection, respirators, and full body suits. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that employers protect their employees from workplace hazards that might cause injury. Controlling a hazard at its source is the best way to protect employees. Depending on the hazard or workplace conditions, OSHA recommends the use of engineering or work practice controls to manage or eliminate hazards to the greatest extent possible [29]. Installing negative pressure air handlers to place a barrier between the hazard and the employees is an engineering control; changing the way in which employees perform their work is a work practice control. When engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are not feasible or provide insufficient protection, PPE must be utilized to protect healthcare workers who are providing care to patients with infectious diseases.",

For healthcare workers caring for patients with EVD, PPE that fully covers skin and clothing and prevents any exposure of the eyes, nose, and mouth is recommended to reduce the risk of accidental self-contamination of mucous membranes or broken skin [30]. Varying levels of PPE are appropriate for use based upon the acuity of the patient, the volume of infectious bodily fluids (blood, vomitus, diarrheal stool) present, and the potential for aerosolization of these fluids [31]. Providing this level of protection often requires that many pieces of PPE be worn; this can lead to an increased risk of fatigue and overheating.",

First-level PPE consisted of fluid-impervious Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) level 4 gown, N95 respirator, surgical hood, face shield, knee-high fluid-impervious boots, three pairs of gloves, and the addition of a second splash-resistant apron as needed (Fig. 21.1). The second level of PPE consisted of fluid-impervious coveralls, inner boot liners, outer boot covers, three pairs of gloves, and the PAPR hood with accompanying belt and blower motor. In the Emory University Special Communicable Diseases Unit (SCDU), varying levels of PPE based upon the risk assessment consisted of a completely disposable ensemble as well as a PAPR ensemble. The disposable PPE included a coverall, apron, booties, double gloves, face shield (goggles if face shield is not available), and a surgical mask. The PAPR level of PPE was comprised of a coverall, double gloves, booties, an apron, and the PAPR hood [20] (Fig. 21.2).

While PPE\nis effective at decreasing exposure to infected bodily fluids among healthcare workers, these healthcare workers are still at risk if this equipment is not removed in a manner that prevents exposure [32]. Detailed guidance with the correct order of donning and doffing equipment should be readily visible on a chart posted within the patient care area. The process used to don and doff PPE should be followed exactly by all personnel every time it is performed and should be guided by a checklist. All staff members, regardless of title or position, are expected to hold one another accountable for adhering to the policies and procedures, including the appropriate use of PPE [22, 33, 34]. The donning and doffing process should incorporate the use of a donning partner who assists the healthcare worker in appropriate placement of PPE and a doffing partner who assists the healthcare worker in removing their PPE. This doffing partner helps to ensure that all steps in the process are completed in the proper order and technique. The physical exhaustion and emotional fatigue that can accompany the provision of care for patients infected with VHF may further increase the chance of an inadvertent exposure to bodily fluids on the outside of the PPE when performing the doffing process [32]. The CDC also recommends the presence of a trained observer when performing the doffing process [30]. The trained observer is available to provide immediate feedback if there is any inadvertent contamination of the healthcare worker. The doffing process can be complex and is considered to be a vulnerable area in which the healthcare providers may be inadvertently contaminated. Simulation studies conducted using donning and doffing scenarios have shown high rates of self-contamination during the doffing process, especially during the removal of the gown and gloves, emphasizing the need\nfor stringent protocols and supervision during this process [28].",

It is important to note that some special containment laboratories may not have the equipment necessary to perform routine laboratory studies such as complete blood counts or metabolic panels, so these tests may need to be performed in the core laboratory if point-of-care testing is not available. A careful risk assessment should occur prior to implementation of any testing in order to minimize risk to the instruments and most importantly the laboratory staff [17].",

It is important to maintain autoclave validation logs to ensure appropriate function. Several strategies have been employed for the transport of waste from the patient care room, including double bagging of waste and wiping the outside of the bag with bleach prior to transport. Storage in waste-holding containers may be necessary while awaiting transport to the autoclave or incinerator. According to current recommendations, liquid waste can be safely disposed of in the sewer system. However, during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak, some facilities utilized pretreatment strategies with a hospital-grade disinfectant prior to disposal of liquid waste [16].

Adequate staffing during the care of the deceased is essential for safe execution of the procedures. The patient remains are first prepared and packaged within the patient room (hot zone) and transferred out into the hallway or anteroom (warm zone) and out of the patient care area (cold zone) for transport to final disposition [65]. The body of the deceased should not be washed or embalmed, medical devices should remain in place, and healthcare workers should not attempt to remove them. Autopsies should not be performed unless specifically directed by the state health department and only after consultation with the CDC and state health department officials [63]. Patient remains should be securely contained within the patient care area. The remains should be packaged using established guidance, which currently includes the use of multiple layers [63]. The first layer to form a protective barrier is a standard hospital issued mortuary bag, followed by a heat sealable chlorine-free material, and final securement is achieved by the use of a heavy duty morgue bag. Each protective barrier that is added should be thoroughly disinfected before moving to the next step and again before being transported out of the hot zone.

A predefined plan should be created, which outlines the preoperative timeout briefing, intraoperative care considerations to include type of PPE to be used by the surgical team, instrument handling and care, recovery of patient in the operating room, and subsequent cleaning and disinfection of the space, instruments, and waste management [70]. Although there are no formal guidelines for the management of patients with suspected VHF in the operating room, there is information available from the American College of Surgeons, who recommends against elective surgical procedures but states that emergency operations can be considered [71]. Development of these processes along with defined drills involving the operating room staff will enhance the capability to successfully navigate through care of PUIs in need of surgical care.",

In the 1995 Kikwit outbreak, children accounted for 27 of the 315 cases (9%), despite constituting 50% of the Zairean population [72]. Similar findings were obtained during the 2000 outbreak in Gulu, Uganda, where children represented 20 of the 218 cases (9%) [73]. Moreover, these children had a case fatality rate of 40%, not dissimilar to the rate among adults. Finally, in a study performed in Guinea during the 2014\u20132016 outbreak, 147 of 823 cases (18%) occurred in children, again despite the fact that children constitute 50% of the population of Guinea [74]. While these findings raise the possibility that children may be less susceptible to infection with Ebola (and, perhaps, with other VHFs), it is likely that this diminished susceptibility derives mainly from social factors; young children are less likely to function as primary caregivers to dying family members, are thus less likely to have contact with body fluids, and are less likely to participate in intimate funereal preparations.",

Fetal and neonatal loss among women with Lassa fever has been reported to be as high as 87%, and there are no reports of neonates born to Ebola-infected mothers surviving beyond 19 days [76, 77]. Vertical transmission of yellow fever appears to occur very rarely, and few reports of affected pregnant women exist for the remaining VHFs [78]. In light of this paucity of information, it is difficult to make specific recommendations for the management of the pregnant woman with VHF. Nonetheless, meticulous planning must be undertaken by facilities that might be called upon to care for pregnant VHF patients. Such planning should address, among others, questions regarding where and when delivery should occur, what equipment is required, and how complications like bleeding should be managed.",

They are also afforded the opportunity to participate in family-centered care, thus emotionally benefitting both parent and child.

The implementation of a consistent and structured training schedule facilitates staff engagement by incorporating activities of varying intensity. Incorporating complex functional exercises, tabletop exercises, skill-focused drills, competency evaluations, and team-building activities builds a strong foundation from which the patient care team can further develop. Educational sessions on emerging infectious diseases may also be helpful to maintain readiness and interest. Developing an annual training calendar that is available to team members in advance sets the expectation for the team members and also helps to minimize scheduling conflicts for required attendance.

Under this system, facilities with high-level containment care capability are designated as \u201cEbola Treatment Centers\u201d (ETC). As of this writing, approximately 55 such centers have applied for designation and funding; among them are ten designated as regional referral centers by DHHS (one in each of its ten geographic regions) [81]. In addition, other hospitals would be designated as \u201cEbola Assessment Hospitals\u201d (EAH), able to manage and isolate persons under investigation (PUI) until a diagnosis of Ebola virus disease (EVD) can be confirmed or refuted. Finally, remaining hospitals (\u201cFrontline Facilities\u201d) would receive training in order to improve their ability to isolate potential Ebola victims until they could be transferred to an EAH or ETC. Within this network, the provision of patient care can be optimized, protocols practiced and improved, and research on investigational drugs and products streamlined.
