To accommodate this huge population in such a tiny place, a highly compact living environment characterized by high-rise apartment buildings has resulted. Recently, with the removal of airport height restrictions in urban areas, residential buildings have been built taller than ever before. It is very common to find new residential buildings that are over 50 storeys.1\nWhile this gives Hong Kong a unique skyscraper identity, such a compact environment poses important questions for the concept of sustainability, in particular for the objective of promoting the social, economic, and environmental quality of human settlement development in Agenda 21 of the United Nations.",

With regard to environmental protection, this can also help reduce urban sprawl and enhance land use efficiency. However, on the negative side, a high-density setting presents a serious threat to the health and safety status of residents. Gove et al. [1] showed that overcrowding has led not only to social incoherence, but also to mental and physical health problems. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 also made the public aware of the vulnerability of densely populated areas to communicable diseases [2]. Apart from health problems, older apartment buildings often lack proper building management and maintenance, possibly due to fragmented ownership and a lack of resources [3]. This poses tremendous safety hazards (e.g. fire and falling objects) to residents and passersby.",

Health and safety were chosen as our focus because they are the most fundamental aspects that a dwelling should fulfil, and yet they usually cannot be easily observed and evaluated by occupants and the public.2\nMoreover, health and safety problems have a stronger spillover effect in a high-density setting than a low-density one\u2014a building with poor health and safety conditions not only adversely affects its own occupants, but also jeopardizes those living and working in the neighborhood.3\nOur study, therefore, contributes to the revelation of hidden building information to the community, which, in turn, helps build a more sustainable city. Utilizing Ho et al.'s [5] simple assessment framework, we surveyed 140 buildings within a short period of time at a relatively low cost. We also extended Ho et al.'s [5] health assessment framework to building safety.4\nTo make the survey results more comprehensible to the public, we translated technical performance details into indices (e.g. a health index and a safety index) for building classification.5\nWith these indices, the public and building owners can easily know the health and safety performance of buildings.",

Bearing this in mind, we based the principles of our survey design on the assessment model proposed by Ho et al. [5], which is simple, and yet theoretically sound. This assessment model is in line with the ideology of the assessment model developed by Kim et al.

First, the items to be surveyed should be flexible enough to embrace most settings of private apartment buildings in a city (e.g. buildings of different designs). Second, for the sake of practicality, the items to be surveyed should be easily obtainable. Site inspections were confined to common areas and the external environment to where assessors could have access. These common areas are usually the most problematic in terms of management and maintenance due to the co-ownership nature of these areas [9]. As for the interior of individual dwelling units, the assessments were based largely on the information available in floor layout plans. Third, only measurable and verifiable items would be assessed, while subjective items should be avoided as much as possible. If subjective judgment (e.g. hygienic condition and visual structural condition) was unavoidable, assessors would be given clear guidelines, with judgments referenced to sample photos of different grades or scores to ensure consistency.",

A healthy building is one that minimizes the physical and mental health risk of its occupants, such as safeguarding against infectious diseases or chronic/mental illnesses found within the built environment. Ho et al. [5] pointed out some characteristics that a healthy building should have:A healthy building should not be too densely populated; its window design and layout should facilitate natural ventilation and penetration of daylight; it should be isolated from noise and air pollution sources; its water supply and waste discharge systems should be properly installed, maintained, and managed; and its environmental conditions should be clean and hygienic (p. 62).\n",

The schemes are the realization and extension of the theoretical assessment framework laid down by Ho et al. [5]. Table 1\nshows the building factors to be assessed and their relative weightings. There are 25 building factors for the BHHI and 19 building factors for the BSCI. To ease understanding and facilitate the performance attribution analysis, we structured the building factors (Level 3) into a hierarchy of performance indicators and grouped them under five main categories (Level 2):1.\nArchitecture: refers to the layout and elevation design of a building (e.g. plan shape, height, and disposition).2.\nBuilding services: service components added onto a building's fabric to provide functionality. Water supply, drainage, refuse disposal, fire services, electrical systems, etc. are included under this category.3.\nExternal environment: the immediate external environment of a building can affect the health and safety of its occupants. For example, green parks are regarded as amenities, whereas street wet markets and petrol refill stations increase the health and safety hazards to a building.4.\nOperationsand maintenance: concerns operational issues in building management, which include the daily management tasks (e.g. cleaning and refuse disposal) and maintenance standards for a building.5.\nManagement approaches: are strategic issues in building management, which include the delineation of responsibility among owners, documentation, emergency preparedness, and the provision of feedback systems.\n",

On one hand, architecture, building services, and external environment are called design factors because they are unchangeable, or changeable only at a relatively high cost once a building has been built and in use. For example, it is usually difficult to add a sprinkler system at the occupancy stage because of insufficient space to accommodate the water tank and the distribution pipework, not to mention the high cost and disruptions involved. These factors should be dealt with in the design stage. On the other hand, operations and maintenance and management approaches are management factors because they are changeable in the occupancy stage, during which building management plays a very important role. For example, a contingency or sinking fund can be set up once building owners agree to do so.",

The other panel was comprised of 23 experts in building safety who provided the weightings of the building factors in the BSCI scheme. Before starting the AHP interviews, the experts were given clear instructions on the pairwise comparison process and furnished with a definition of the key terms used in the questionnaires.

After this interactive interview process, if a respondent's answers still failed to reach the consistency ratio suggested by Saaty, his/her responses would be discarded from the respective level in the hierarchy. Despite the high cost associated with this method of information collection, it greatly improved the reliability of the factor weightings, which is one of the most crucial aspects of the assessment framework.

This arrangement makes judgments on both quantitative and qualitative criteria easier, and it works well even for inexperienced assessors [11].",

The need for site visits is demonstrable because the information from other sources does not often reflect the real situation of a building. Discrepancies between the situation on-site and the information contained in the official records or other sources are common [12]. An on-site assessment starts with an initial quick inspection of a building's exterior prior to the internal inspection of the building. This sequence was justified by Hoxley [13], who stressed that anything missed during the initial inspection of the exterior could be re-inspected relatively easily, but it may not be so easy to re-inspect the interior when any problem is raised during the subsequent external inspection. The initial external inspection allows assessors to note the special areas or aspects to which they should pay more attention during the internal survey.",

The reasons for choosing YTM were twofold. First, building plans in YTM are more readily available than those in other districts due to the recent digitalization of the building plans by the government. Second, there is a wide variety of residential buildings in YTM (e.g. post-war traditional Chinese low-rise buildings, single block buildings in congested sites, buildings with very large footprint areas, and relatively new building developments).

Then, buildings were sampled from each zone according to development scale, building age, and management structure. This reduced potential bias towards a particular type of building.

It is likely that property values will be affected after the publication of the BHHI and BSCI. Building owners can also make use of the performance information to facilitate their maintenance or refurbishment decisions. In multi-ownership apartment buildings, one of the key obstacles in reaching collective decisions to carry out improvement works is that owners have different, if not conflicting, views on whether or not to make improvements.

For the BSCI, pure design factors contributed 18% to the total variation, while pure management factors contributed 45%. Similar to its health counterpart, pure management factors are more influential than pure design factors in affecting the variations in safety performance. In other words, most of the variations in building health and safety conditions were attributed to differences in building management rather than building design. This should be encouraging to owners of underperforming buildings because management factors are alterable during the occupancy stage, and they can improve health and safety performance by enhancing management. However, as opposed to the BHHI's results, the co-movement of design and management factors occupies quite a significant share, being responsible for 37% of the variations in the BSCI. A possible reason for such a strong co-movement is that design and management factors are driven by some common factors, notably building age.10\n",
