Several studies have documented the course of viral infection in postnatally infected pigs; however, very little is known regarding sites of virus replication during persistent infection of pigs exposed to PRRSV in utero. In this study, virus replication and PRRSV-specific antibody were followed for several hundred days in a group of pigs derived from three sows infected at 90 days of gestation with PRRSV isolate VR-2332. Eighty-four percent of pigs were born viremic with a mortality of 54% within 21 days after birth. At approximately 60 days sera from pigs were negative for virus by virus isolation. Analysis of virus replication in the tissues of pigs randomly sacrificed between 63 and 132 days showed no evidence of virus in lung and other non-lymphoid organs. However, virus was easily recovered from tonsil and lymph nodes and in situ hybridization identified these tissues as sites of virus replication. Even though replication was at a low level, virus was easily transmitted to sentinel pigs. By 260 days pigs became seronegative and did not transmit virus to sentinel pigs. Sacrifice of remaining pigs after 300 days showed no evidence of virus in blood and tissues. This study shows that congenital PRRSV-infected pigs can support virus replication for an",

Other members of the arterivirus group include lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV; for review see Plagemann, 1996) . The arteriviruses, toroviruses, and coronaviruses are members of a single order, Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997) . Arteriviruses structurally resemble togaviruses, but similar to coronaviruses, replicate via a nested 3 -co-terminal set of subgenomic mRNAs that possesses a common leader and a poly-A tail (Snijder and Mulenberg, 1998) . The arteriviruses exhibit several important properties relevant to the study of viral pathogenesis, including cytopathic replication in macrophages, the capacity to establish and maintain an asymptomatic persistent infection, as well as cause severe and fatal disease (Plagemann, 1996) .",

The reproductive form of PRRS occurs following the infection of pregnant gilts or sows. Accordingly, virus-induced reproductive failure can present clinically as increased regular and delayed returns to estrus and not-in-pig sows, as well as abortions, mummified fetuses, stillbirths and weak-born pigs.

It is assumed that persistence is maintained by the ability of PRRSV to evade host defenses and establish a long-term asymptomatic infection within individual pigs. Even though PRRSV-specific antibody appears as early as 5 days post-infection and is followed by serum neutralizing activity and cell-mediated immunity Molitor, 1997, 1999; Rowland et al., 1999 Rowland et al., , 2001 persistently infected pigs can continue to shed virus. The mechanistic basis for PRRSV persistence is not known. Similar to LDV, PRRSV may sustain replication in a subpopulation of renewable macrophages, while avoiding host-defenses . Another possibility is the restriction of virus replication to immunoprivileged sites, such as the male reproductive tract (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Sur et al., 1997) , which is observed during infection with other arteriviruses, such as EAV and LDV (Holyoak et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1995) . In previous work characterizing quasispecies evolution during infection, we proposed that antigenic drift in the ectodomain of GP5 may lead to the selection of clones that are resistant to neutralizing antibody or change the tropism of the virus for a different population of cells .",

However, the ability of these long-term infected pigs to shed virus was not determined. Very little is known regarding the course of virus replication in pigs exposed to virus in utero. The purpose of this study was to further understand persistent infection in congenitally infected pigs by characterizing the course of clinical disease, sites of virus replication and the capacity to transmit virus in a group of pigs exposed to PRRSV in utero.",

All sows seroconverted and farrowed naturally at 114 days of gestation. Outcomes for the 35 piglets from the three infected sows are summarized in Table 1 . Seven pigs were stillborn and due to the degraded condition of the tissues were not subjected to further study. Analysis of virus and antibody in blood and/or umbilical cords from the 28 live neonates showed that at least 20 or 74% were virus isolation (VI) or RT-PCR positive for PRRSV at the time of farrowing indicating that in utero infection was successful. The eight neonates that were identified as PRRSV-negative at the time of birth became VI-positive by 7 dpf. Neonates as a group exhibited signs consistent with PRRSV infection, with pronounced dyspnea being the most common symptom. About half of the pigs exhibited more severe disease signs, including ocular edema and inappetance. Microhistology showed PRRSV-induced pathological changes in the lungs and other organs of acutely infected symptomatic pigs, including interstitial pneumonia with the infiltration of proteinaceous debris from the interstitial space into the alveoli. Lymph nodes were generally enlarged with germinal center hypertrophy, hyperplasia and necrosis. Lesions in the brain (encephalitis) and heart (myocarditis) and stomach of some pigs were also observed. There was a 54% mortality between 1 and 21 dpf. Only one pig in the early mortality group was confirmed to have died from a non-PRRS-related cause. Pigs that survived beyond 21 dpf eventually recovered and showed no external signs of acute infection and there were no PRRSV-related deaths after 21 dpf. For the purpose of comparison, we included a litter from a single mock-infected sow. The 10 piglets, born at the same time as the PRRSV pigs, appeared normal and showed no mortality within 21 dpf.",

Virus isolation showed all umbilical cords from infected neonates to be positive for PRRSV. Neonates that were VI or RT-PCR negative for PRRSV in serum were also negative for PRRSV in umbilical cord tissues. The recovery of virus from umbilical cords presented the possibility that virus was isolated from circulating blood and not from cells supporting virus replication. In situ hybridization, for the detection of cells possessing viral RNA, was performed on a single microscopic cross-section of each umbilical cord. We identified PRRSV RNA-positive cells in 10 of the 15 tissues cross-sections from VI-positive umbilical cords, indicating the presence of infected cells. A representative example of PRRSV RNA-positive cells in an umbilical cord cross-section is shown in Fig. 3A . Positive cells were generally found within the smooth muscle regions of umbilical cord tissues. As a negative control, in situ hybridization was performed on umbilical cord sections from six uninfected pigs. All six were negative for the presence of cells containing viral RNA.

By 7 dpf, all pigs were VI-positive in serum, with the percentage of VI-positive serum samples declining at about 21 dpf. The decline in the number of VI-positive serum samples was associated with the appearances of peak antibody levels and virus neutralizing activity. The disappearance of virus from the blood also correlated with the recovery of pigs from acute disease. The last VI-and RT-PCR-positive serum samples were obtained at 48 and 78 dpf, respectively. Pigs that attained a VI-negative status remained VI-negative throughout the remainder of the study. However, it should be noted that pigs that became PCR negative did not always stay negative. Periodically we found serum samples between 78 and 228 dpf, which were PCR-positive, even though the previous and subsequent samples taken from the same animal were negative by PCR. These intermittent PCR-positive results can best be explained by the presence of a small amount of viral RNA, but at or near the lower detection limits of the PCR assay (data not shown).

Since pigs were suckling prior to 19 days, we assume that passive antibody from the mother was contributing to the humoral response. After 28 days, antibody gradually declined and by 260 dpf the remaining four pigs had attained a seronegative status (S/P ratio < 0.4) and remained seronegative throughout the remainder of the study. Virus neutralizing activity in serum was first detected in one pig at 7 dpf (neutralizing titer = 4). By 56 dpf all pigs showed detectable neutralizing activity. Since these measurements were made several weeks after weaning, we presume that virus neutralizing activity was generated by the immune system of the congenitally infected pigs. At their peak, between days 56 and 260, neutralizing titers ranged between 1:16 and 1:256 (Fig. 2) . This relatively low amount of neutralizing activity was not unexpected and is typical of the neutralizing response during infection of older pigs (Yoon et al., 1995; Wills et al., 1997) . Interestingly, virus neutralizing activity was detected in sera well beyond 260 days, even though all pigs were seronegative for PRRSV by the IDEXX ELISA test (S/P ratios below 0.40). The source of the virus neutralizing activity in serum was not determined. However, the presence of neutralizing activity in \"seronegative\" sera can be explained based on the different sensitivities of the assays used to measure antibody and neutralizing activity. For example, we cannot rule out the possibility that pigs possessing an ELISA S/P ratio less than 0.4 have some PRRSV antibody, but at amounts below the confidence limits of the assay.",

During this stage, PRRSV-specific antibody was declining, but all pigs were seropositive and possessed virus neutralizing activity at a serum dilution of at least 1:16. There were no overt clinical signs of acute PRRSV infection and all pigs were VI-negative in serum. Virus isolation and RT-PCR were performed on lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues from nine of the asymptomatic pigs, sacrificed at random between 63 and 132 dpf. VI and RT-PCR results for lung, mandibular lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, tonsil and serum are presented in Table 2 . In contrast to the acutely infected pigs, all lung and non-lymphoid tissue samples were negative for virus and viral RNA. The absence of detectable amounts of virus in lungs was based on negative results for VI, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization assays of tissue samples from each lung quadrant. Virus isolation, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization also failed to identify virus or viral RNA in kidney, bladder, heart, aorta, liver, intestines, stomach, testes/ovaries, nasal turbinates, and salivary glands (data not shown). Positive VI and RT-PCR results were frequently obtained from homogenates of tonsil (seven of nine pigs) and mandibular lymph nodes (eight of nine pigs; Table 2 ). Mesenteric, aortic, cervical, tracheal, medial iliac lymph nodes also yielded virus and/or viral RNA, but at much lower frequencies (see Table 2 for mesenteric lymph node data). Virus or viral RNA was not detected in spleen or thymus (data not shown). Consistent with the VI and RT-PCR results, in situ hybridization identified PRRSV RNA-positive cells in tonsil and mandibular lymph nodes. PRRSV RNA-positive cells in a mandibular lymph node at 63 dpf and tonsil at 132 dpf are shown in Fig. 4 . Only a few RNA-positive cells could be identified within a given tissue section. Therefore, the locations of RNA-positive positive cells were confirmed by performing hybridization of adjacent tissue sections (Fig. 4) . All pigs sacrificed during this time possessed detectable amounts of virus neutralizing activity. Together these data show that PRRSV replication during asymptomatic infection is absent from lung and other non-lymphoid tissues and is primarily restricted to tonsil and lymph nodes, even in the presence of humoral immunity.",

Sentinel pigs were allowed to commingle with the infected herd for 1 week and then removed to separate isolation rooms for observation and assessment of infection by VI and serology. All sentinel pigs were VI-positive in serum within 1 week after introduction and seroconverted a week later.

To determine if PRRSV pigs were capable of shedding virus, four age-matched PRRSV seronegative sentinel pigs were introduced at 260 dpf and maintained in continual contact with the PRRSV pigs for at least 56 days. Commingling culminated in the mating of each PRRSV pig to an aged-matched sentinel. Two litters were obtained from the three PRRSV females. The adult female pigs and litters were sacrificed and assessed for PRRSV replication. All three female pigs and associated litters were negative for PRRSV antibody and viral RNA as indicated by negative results for in situ hybridization and by performing RT-PCR in lungs, lymph nodes and tonsils. The single sentinel female pig and litter obtained after mating to the seronegative PRRSV boar were also negative for PRRSV.

            "text": "The results from this study show that congenital PRRSV infection can be divided into distinct stages, unique in terms of serology, virology and clinical disease. The first stage covers the period of in utero exposure to virus. These data demonstrate that not all fetuses are infected at the same time and some fetuses may escape infection altogether. Furthermore, the positive association between the presence of antibody at birth with early mortality indicates that the earlier a fetus is infected the more severe the clinical disease (Fig. 1) . Since it takes 1-2 weeks to develop antibody, we assume that seropositive fetuses were infected 1-2 weeks after infection of the sow or approximately 1-2 weeks prior to birth. As a whole, these data show that the placenta is a barrier to PRRSV, but this barrier does break down with time. There are at least two sources of virus-related damage that can account for early mortality in the antibody-positive fetuses. The first is the formation of PRRSV lesions in fetal organs. However, the target organs in the fetus may be different from those in the postnatally infected pig. For instance, porcine alveolar macrophages, which support virus replication to high levels in postnatal pigs are absent from the fetal lung. In preliminary studies, we found relatively large amounts of virus in the thymus from fetuses obtained 1-2 weeks prior to birth (data not shown). Feng et al. (2001) observed thymic lesions in congenital PRRSV pigs sacrificed at 12 dpf. The possible effect of PRRSV infection on fetal/neonatal primary immune organs has obvious implications in the increased susceptibility of congenitally infected pigs to secondary infections. A second source of fetal damage is through the disruption of support tissues, such as placenta and umbilical cord. Lager and Halbur (1996) reported lesions in umbilical cord, which appeared to be sufficient to cause anoxia in the developing fetus. Even though umbilical cord was identified as a sight of virus replication in this study, we were not able to identify PRRSV-related lesions. The absence of umbilical cord lesions may reflect the different isolate used in this study.",

Congenital PRRS pigs were able to mount a prolonged neutralizing antibody response at levels typically found in experimentally infected older pigs (Yoon et al., 1995) .

This stage of congenital PRRSV infection was characterized as the period of time when pigs no longer exhibited clinical signs of acute disease, were VI-negative in serum, but still seropositive. In this study it was represented by a group of nine pigs sacrificed between 63 and 132 days after birth. Perhaps, the most interesting finding was the identification of virus in tonsil and mandibular lymph node, but not in lung and other non-lymphoid organs. These results are in agreement with studies identifying tonsil as a source of virus during persistent infection Allende et al., 2000; Horter et al., 2002) , but contradict other studies identifying pulmonary macrophages as the source of virus replication in persistently infected pigs (Mengeling et al., 1996; Duan et al., 1997) . Our conclusion that virus is absent from the lungs in persistently infected pigs is based on a thorough analysis of virus replication, including the use of VI, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Continuous virus replication in regional lymph nodes accounts for the efficient transmission via oral-nasal secretions and in semen during persistent infection (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1998) . The basis for an eventual change in organ tropism, from multiple sites of PRRSV replication to preferential replication in tonsil and lymph nodes, is not known. In previous work we identified the emergence of a virus sub-population during persistent infection, which possessed a mutation in the ectodomain of ORF5, the major envelope glycoprotein. This mutation may increase the tropism of PRRSV for replication in a macrophage subpopulation that resides in tonsils and lymph nodes.",

            "text": "We followed virus and antibody in four congenital PRRSV pigs for more than a year. At the time of necropsy these pigs were seronegative for PRRSV (S/P ELISA ratio less than 0.4) and showed no evidence of virus replication, as determined by the absence of viral RNA in serum and in tissues. In this study we were not able to determine exactly when virus disappeared from these pigs. However, the last RT-PCR positive serum sample was obtained at 228 dpf and sentinel pigs did not become infected when introduced at 260 dpf. The failure of sentinel pigs to become infected after an extended period of intimate contact with the congenital PRRSV-infected pigs indicated that PRRSV replication was not reactivated.",

(2003) . The isolation of virus from lymph nodes at 132 dpf in this study is longer than the isolation of infectious virus at 84 days from pigs infected at 1 month of age (Allende et al., 2000) , but is similar to length of time reported by Wills et al. (2003) . Because of viral strain differences, it is difficult to assess the impact of congenital infection on virus replication, shedding and persistence by making comparisons with other published studies performed in older pigs. However, in agreement with Allende et al. (2001) PRRSV replication does not establish a steady-state equilibrium in the manner of other persistent arteriviruses, such as LDV or SHFV, but gradually declines over time, with the lymphoid organs as the last vestige of virus replication. The presence of an extended period of ongoing PRRSV replication in pigs with substantial anti-PRRSV humoral and cell-mediated immune responses suggests that the eventual elimination of the virus from congenital PRRS pigs may ultimately reflect the disappearance of PRRSV-permissive cells with age.",

Stage I covers the period of in utero exposure to virus during which time fetuses are infected at different times and some fetuses remain uninfected. The positive association between the presence of PRRSV antibody at birth with early mortality indicates that the earlier a fetus is infected the more severe the clinical disease outcome. Stage II is the period of acute infection. During this time pigs show signs of acute PRRSV. In this study virus was isolated from all tissues, and all tissues contained cells supporting virus replication. Stage III is a period when pigs no longer exhibit clinical disease signs, are VI-negative and largely RT-PCR negative in serum and possess peak levels of virus neutralizing activity. Even though virus replication is relatively low, persistently infected pigs can efficiently transmit virus to naive pigs. Stage IV of congenital PRRSV infection is viral clearance.",
