            "text": "With the completion of the Human Genome Project, much interest has focused on genetic variation among individuals and understanding how genetic factors contribute to susceptibility to diseases and responsiveness to therapy [1], [2]. Once a mutation or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with a particular disease or drug response is known, it is often incorporated into nucleic acid tests used for routine diagnostic and screening purposes [3]. Molecular laboratories require methods that are specific, reliable, rapid and cost-effective to allow routine high-throughput testing of many DNA samples [4]. The basic components of nucleic acid detection methodologies are assay chemistry and analysis platform. Characteristic genotyping technologies include both solid phase (gels, DNA chips, glass slide arrays) and homogeneous solution assay formats (mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis). However, methodologies that allow multiplexing (DNA microarrays, capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry) have the advantage that they allow for simultaneous detection of multiple nucleic acid sequences in a single reaction vessel which reduces time, labor and cost as compared to single-reaction-based detection methods.",

Using precise amounts of each of these fluorochromes, an array is created consisting of 100 different microsphere sets with specific spectral addresses. Each microsphere set can possess a different reactant on its surface. Because microsphere sets can be distinguished by their spectral addresses, they can be combined, allowing up to 100 different analytes to be measured simultaneously in a single reaction vessel. A third fluorochrome coupled to a reporter molecule quantifies the biomolecular interaction that has occurred at the microsphere surface. Microspheres are interrogated individually in a rapidly flowing fluid stream as they pass by two separate lasers in the Luminex\u00ae 100\u2122 analyzer. A 635-nm 10-mW red diode laser excites the two fluorochromes contained within the microspheres and a 532-nm, 13-mW yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser excites the reporter fluorochrome (R-phycoerythrin, Alexa 532, or Cy3) bound to the microsphere surface. High-speed digital signal processing classifies the microsphere based on its spectral address and quantifies the reaction on the surface. Thousands of microspheres are interrogated per second resulting in an analysis system capable of analyzing and reporting up to 100 different reactions in a single reaction vessel in just a few seconds per sample (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "Several assay chemistries have been used for nucleic acid detection on the xMAP system. One approach is to use direct hybridization of a labeled polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified target DNA to microsphere sets bearing oligonucleotide capture probes specific for each sequence (Fig. 2\n). Direct hybridization is the simplest assay chemistry for single nucleotide discrimination and takes advantage of the fact that for oligonucleotides approximately 15 to 20 nucleotides in length, the melting temperature for hybridization of a perfectly matched template compared to one with a single base mismatch can differ by several degrees [34], [35]. As in other assay chemistries utilizing a solid phase, the reaction kinetics can be adversely affected by immobilization of a reactant on a solid surface. The effects are less severe for a microsphere in suspension than for a flat array but the diffusion rate of the immobilized capture probe can be slower and the effective concentration is reduced as compared to free DNA in solution [35], [36]. Design of sequence-specific capture probes and PCR primers for a direct hybridization assay on the xMAP suspension array can be facilitated through the use of a tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC)-containing hybridization buffer. TMAC stabilizes AT basepairs, minimizing the effect of base composition on hybridization [37], [38]. For oligonucleotides up to 200 basepairs in length, hybridization efficiency in TMAC is a function of the length of the perfect match and less dependent on base composition. Hybridization buffers incorporating 3 M or 4 M TMAC equalize the melting points of different probes and increase duplex yields, allowing probes with different characteristics to be used under identical hybridization conditions [39], [40]. Typically for single nucleotide discrimination, capture probes are designed to be matched in length at approximately 20 nucleotides. The probes are complementary in sequence to the labeled strand of the PCR product and the SNP or mutation is located at the center of the probe. Mismatches in the center are known to have a more profound effect on the equilibrium state than mismatches near the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032end [41]. Probes are modified to provide a terminal amine and spacer for coupling to the carboxylated microspheres using a carbodiimide coupling procedure [5], [19].",

The probe melting temperature is influenced by length, sequence, and type and position of the mismatched base. The effect of a mismatch on hybridization is greater with increasing temperature and decreasing probe length [9], [35]. Thus, discrimination can be improved by increasing the hybridization temperature and/or decreasing the probe length. After testing known DNA samples under a set of standard hybridization conditions, nucleotides are added to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the probe to improve sensitivity or removed from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the probe to increase specificity. The position of the mutation within the probe sequence can be adjusted when necessary to avoid formation of secondary structures and adequate specificity can usually be achieved when the mutation is between positions 8 and 14 of a 20-nucleotide probe.",

Using a small target DNA minimizes the potential for steric hindrance to affect hybridization efficiency. In some cases, larger targets (400\u20131200 basepairs) have been used successfully, suggesting that hybridization efficiency is also dependent on the sequence and overall secondary structure of target [25]. The hybridization kinetics and thermodynamic affinities of matched and mismatched sequences can be driven in a concentration-dependent manner [42]. At concentrations beyond the saturation level, the hybridization efficiency can decrease presumably due to competition of the complementary strand and renaturation of the PCR product [9], [32]. Therefore, it is also important to determine the range of target concentrations that yield efficient hybridization without sacrificing discrimination.",

Comparison of the results to those from gel-based OLA for 9563 genotypes showed 99.3% agreement in genotype assignments. Some disadvantages of the SBCE assay are that excess dNTPs from PCR must be removed prior to SBCE and each allele-specific reaction for each labeled ddNTP must be performed separately. To simplify the assay procedure, they used ASPE, which requires no PCR cleanup and uses only a single labeled nucleotide, thus allowing them to multiplex all of the alleles of a particular SNP. Fifteen SNPs were genotyped from 96 samples using multiplexed ASPE, for a total of 1440 genotype determinations. The results obtained by ASPE showed 98.7% concordance with those obtained by OLA. Cost of the assay can vary greatly depending on the number of SNPs, the extent of multiplexing and the number of samples assayed, but the investigators estimated their average cost to be less than US$0.20 per SNP, excluding the cost of PCR, and found the costs of SBCE and ASPE comparable. They demonstrated the robustness, accuracy and high-throughput that can be achieved with DNA polymerase-based SNP assays and the reduced cost attained by using a less expensive flow analysis platform with 96-well plate readout for detection.",

Dendrimer-labeling of the target DNA resulted in a 10-fold fluorescence amplification over single streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin labeling and increased the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 8.5. The level of sensitivity allowed multiplexed detection of DNA hybridization on a single molecule level per bead and provided an assay useful for detecting target DNAs at low concentrations.",

The reaction products were then captured by hybridization onto microspheres bearing the complementary capture probe (cZipCode) and detected on the Luminex 100 analyzer. ASPE could discriminate between the possible genotypes in the same reaction, whereas SBCE required a separate reaction for each nucleotide but could then be completely multiplexed for capture onto the microspheres. Both assays produced results identical to direct sequencing and the accuracy was also demonstrated by species-specific patterns that were obtained for related bacterial strains.",

Biotinylated PCR primers corresponding to the DR sequence were used to simultaneously amplify and label all of the spacers present. The amplified products were then detected by direct hybridization to a mixture of 43 microsphere sets bearing specific capture probes for each of the 43 spacer sequences. The assay was highly reproducible with an average coefficient of variation (CV) of 5.8% and the results from the suspension array were in perfect agreement with those obtained by reverse line blot hybridization.

As identification of disease-causing mutations increases, so increases the number of DNA tests to be implemented in the molecular laboratory, highlighting the need for rapid, accurate and cost-effective high-throughput nucleic acid detection methods. The Luminex xMAP system is a multiplexed microsphere-based suspension array platform capable of analyzing and reporting up to 100 different reactions in a single reaction vessel. In recent years, xMAP technology has been used increasingly for multiplexed high-throughput nucleic acid detection in the research, commercial and diagnostic molecular laboratory settings. The published literature clearly demonstrates the ability of this platform to meet the current and upcoming needs of the molecular laboratory. With the commercial availability of numerous assay kits, nucleic acid testing using xMAP technology can easily be implemented into the laboratory workflow and can be automated for even less hands-on time. As this technology matures, it will continue to improve and be incorporated into novel assays. It is anticipated that many more xMAP-based applications for nucleic acid detection will become commercially available and xMAP technology will be used more extensively for quantitative nucleic acid detection and gene expression profiling in the future.",
