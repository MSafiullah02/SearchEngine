This occurrence led public health officials to improve surveillance systems worldwide. Enhanced surveillance revealed a continuous spread of EV-D68 in several North and South America countries, including Canada (2), Chile (3) , and Mexico (4) , and in several countries in Europe, including Germany (5), Denmark (6) , and France (7) . However, in Africa, data on the spread of EV-D68 from the 2014 US outbreak were scarce. This retrospective study sought to confirm the circulation of EV-D68 in Senegal during the 2014 outbreak and to characterize the molecular composition of any EV-D68 strains that circulated.",

As part of routine surveillance, specimens were initially tested for respiratory viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and bocaviruses (8) . Later, samples collected during September-December 2014 were screened for EV-D68, as described elsewhere (9) . For the molecular studies, the viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) gene region of EV-D68 was amplified and sequenced as described elsewhere (10) .",

Results identified EV-D68 activity from October through December 2014 in Senegal, with peak EV-D68 detection occurring in October. This aligns with findings reported in countries in Europe (11); in North America, peaks were mapped in August in the United States (13) and in September in Canada (14). These results suggest circulation of the virus in Senegal 2 months after the beginning of the outbreak in the United States (1). This 2-month delay was also noted by Nathaniel et al. (15) before the introduction of EV-D68 strains in the Caribbean region. However, earlier EV-D68 circulation was reported in Latin America (3, 4) and Europe (5-7).",

Phylogenetically, the US outbreak was characterized by a novel subclade, B1, which emerged rapidly and was the dominant strain. Available data indicate that the exclusive circulation of clade A in Senegal during the 2014 outbreak was reported elsewhere only in Spain. In contrast, Slovenia, Norway (11), the Caribbean region (15), Mexico (4), and Chile (3) reported only clade B over the same period.",

First, the inclusion of fever as a clinical sign for the case definition may have contributed to underestimating the number of EV-D68 infections during the North America outbreak; several studies have reported cases of afebrile EV-D68 infections (13). A second limitation was the small number of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in this study, because a higher proportion of detected EV-D68 in SARI patients or those with other concurrent conditions has been previously reported (5) . At the time of data collection, the SARI sentinel surveillance system we used was not as developed as it is now. Inclusion in the screening of a larger number of hospitalized patients would probably present a more accurate picture of EV-D68 circulation. Finally, we conducted a retrospective study. The database we used contained limited information on disease outcome, and atypical clinical symptoms were not reported. Thus, the association between EV-D68 infections and severe clinical signs could not be established.",

The phylogenetic tree is rooted by the oldest EV-D68 sequence in GenBank, the Fermon strain (pink), collected in 1962 in California, USA.
