In CBBs funded with public or government monies, the promotion is generally carried out and restricted to antenatal clinics selected as collection sites. The material used in the promotion includes leaflets, videos, seminars, etc. These should provide as much information as possible about the program including the need for consent, the right to withdraw at any step of the process, the clinical use of the collection, and about its potential use in research if the collected unit is not suitable for clinical banking. The promotional material should be clearly understood by the potential mother donors, and it should be translated into various languages if required. The latter is particularly important when recruiting donors are from an ethnic minority background and are not fluent in the language of the country where the recruitment is taking place.41\n",

Donors with a family or personal history of genetic disease, particularly relating to the hematopoietic or immune system, should be asked for details of those suffering from such diseases and their family relationship to the infant donor. Further details may be required from the general physician or other professionals. The communicable disease risk history of a surrogate mother who carries an infant not genetically related to her, and of a sperm, egg, or embryo donor shall also be obtained and documented if applicable. Travel history of potential donors is also important to assess risks.

The introduction of the \u201cmini consent\u201d form, which allows for the collection of the CBU, has facilitated the implementation of the EUTCD, and it has also increased the efficiency of collections by decreasing the wastage of CBUs discarded due to the lack of consent.47 Following the initial mini consent, a full more detailed consent is required and this provides the basis for proceeding to the processing and testing of the collected unit.",

If NIMAs are taken into account, additional \u201cvirtual\u201d HLA phenotypes of the CBU are available for matching consideration. One locus NIMA substitution for the current matching guidelines for HLA-A, B, or DRB1 loci would add six \u201cvirtual\u201d phenotypes, two substitutions would provide 12 \u201cvirtual\u201d phenotypes, and three substitutions would provide eight \u201cvirtual\u201d phenotypes. One CBU could then provide a maximum of 26 \u201cvirtual\u201d phenotypes if all HLA-A, B, and DRB1 loci are included. The NHS-CBB currently has 3000 UCB units listed with maternal HLA phenotypes in the British Bone Marrow Registry (BBMR) and BMDW. These UCB units have the potential of adding 18,000 new phenotypes with one NIMA substitution, 36,000 new phenotypes with two, and 24,000 with three substitutions, giving a total of 78,000 new phenotypes for the CBU registered. If maternal HLA typing was performed on the 15,000 NHS-CBB banked and registered CBUs, a potential 390,000 additional \u201cvirtual\u201d CBU phenotypes would be added to the BBMR. By using information on the HLA types of NIMAs it is possible to increase the number of CBU phenotypes available for searching and consequently increase the probability of finding an appropriately matched donor for a patient.",

This limitation, which seems to be primarily due to the insufficient number of HSC and to immunological na\u00efvety of the immunological effectors, such as T cells in the UCB collections, has led to the development of a number of approaches to improve these outcomes. Of these the most successful so far has been the use of two UCB units for an individual patient in order to increase the number of transplanted HSCs.111., 112., 113. This approach has yielded comparable results to those using a single CBU, and has opened the way for using UCB transplantation in older and heavier patients. The initial protocol developed by the Minneapolis group has now been adopted by many centers with or without modifications and has allowed the performance of UCB transplantation in patients not previously considered for the procedure due to their age or weight.",
