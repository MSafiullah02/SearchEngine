The 3 units of HITs were used to measure the surface temperature of a water bath, which ranged from 32\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F to 107.6\u00b0F), simultaneously against an electronic thermometer (MAXIMUMTHERMOMETER GT-131; Geratherm Medical AG, Geswchwenda, Germany). Measurement of surface temperature of the water bath by HIT and electronic thermometer was made directly from the surface of the water bath with no extra treatment (eg, addition of floating reflective device). The surface temperature of the water bath was estimated by HIT with assessment of the amount of infrared emission from the surface of water. All readings were obtained by a single observer. Regression analysis was done to determine the comparability of surface temperature measured by HIT and electronic thermometer. The units of HITs used for measurement were also entered into the regression model as a categoric covariance. The agreement of surface temperature determined by HIT and electronic thermometer was assessed by the method suggested by Bland and Altman.3 Ninety-five percent limits of agreement were reported.",

The HIT was placed 5 cm away from the center of the forehead and perpendicular to the forehead. FT was recorded when a steady reading was shown. We recorded the FT, sex, and race of the subjects. All temperature readings were measured by a single observer with the same HIT in an air-conditioned environment. The unpaired Student's t test was used to compare group means. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 10.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Approval was granted by the ethnic committee, and verbal consent was obtained from the subjects.",

Such discrepancies could lead to inaccurate and misleading recordings during disease surveillance. Institutions using similar equipment for fever screening should check the offsets before introducing them to clinical usage because each HIT may have a unique offset (Fig 1). The problems with the inaccurate readings in our study were not likely because of observer error because a single observer was deployed in this study. Hence, our study data suggested that the current brand of HIT was not accurate enough for clinical purpose. Further improvement in the quality of the product is required, and other similar HITs for assessment of FT require further studies.",
