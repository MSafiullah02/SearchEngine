Numerous viruses have been shown to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a medically important human pathogen that causes acute and chronic hepatitis. In this study, we screened all the nonstructural proteins of HCV and found that HCV NS2 could suppress RNAi induced either by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that NS2 could suppress RNAi via its direct interaction with doublestranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and siRNAs, and further identified that the cysteine 184 of NS2 is required for the RNAi suppression activity through a serial of point mutation analyses. Together, our findings uncovered that HCV NS2 can act as a VSR in vitro, thereby providing novel insights into the life cycle and virus-host interactions of HCV.",

Its genome is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved by host and viral proteases to produce ten mature viral proteins, including structural core protein, envelope proteins E1 and E2, the p7 ion channel protein, and nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B (Yin et al. 2018) . HCV infection causes acute and chronic hepatitis in humans with a high propensity for chronicity. A large number of HCV-infected patients fail to clear this virus and remain asymptomatic for years to develop severe liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Paboriboune et al. 2018) . The capability of establishing chronic infection by HCV is partly due to its ability to evade host innate immune responses (Horner and Gale 2013) .",

Moreover, HCV structural E2 protein was also identified to antagonize RNAi by targeting AGO2 (Ji et al. 2008) . Consistent with the findings in HCV, a number of RNA viruses were shown to encode more than one viral protein to counteract RNAi. For instance, VP35, VP30 and VP40 of EBOV were found to suppress RNAi through different mechanisms (Haasnoot et al. 2007; Fabozzi et al. 2011) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encoded 7a and nucleocapsid contain RNAi suppression activities (Karjee et al. 2010; Cui et al. 2015) . Besides, Tat and Nef proteins of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) were identified to suppress RNAi through the dsRNA-binding and AGO interaction, respectively (Bennasser et al. 2005; Aqil et al. 2013) . The phenomena of viruses encoding multiple VSRs as well as VSRs targeting different steps of the RNAi pathway highlight the importance of suppressing RNAi during the viral life cycle. Although the structural core and E2 proteins of HCV were shown to suppress RNAi, it is unclear if any HCV nonstructural protein contains RNAi suppression activity.",

Because the dsRNA/ siRNA-binding and protein dimerization are critical for VSR's activity (Maillard et al. 2019) , the positivelycharged and highly conserved residues, including arginine (R), lysine (K), histidine (H), glutamic acid (E) and cysteine (C) were subjected to single-point mutation to alanine (A), and the resulting mutant NS2 proteins were then examined via the reversal-of-silencing assay in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5A-5C ). Our findings show that the C184A mutation (NS2 C184A ) significantly suppressed the activity of HCV NS2 to suppress RNAi (Fig. 5C, lane 7 and Fig. 5D, lane 5) . Moreover, we further confirmed that the C184 is critical for the VSR activity of HCV NS2 via the reversal-of-silencing assay in Huh7.5 cell line (Fig. 5E) , which is usually used for hepatitis C research. Moreover, we found that C184A abolished the dsRNA-and siRNAbinding activities of HCV NS2 in vitro (Fig. 6A, 6B ). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the plasmids encoding EGFP (0.1 lg) and EGFP-specific shRNA (0.3 lg), together with the increasing amounts of the plasmid encoding HCV NS2 (0.5 lg, 1.0 lg and 1.5 lg, respectively). At 48 hpt, EGFP mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting (A). GAPDH mRNA was used as the loading control. The mRNA levels of EGFP normalized to that of GAPDH were quantified with Bio-Rad Quantity One software and were graphed in (B) with that in the presence of the HCV NS2 (0.5 lg) defined as 100%. Error bars represent SD values from the results of three independent experiments. *P \\ 0.05, as measured by two-way ANOVA (GraphPad Prism). Cell lysates were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Flag, anti-Myc and anti-Tubulin antibodies. C HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP (0.1 lg) and EGFP-specific shRNA (0.3 lg), together with either empty vector or the plasmid encoding HCV NS2 (1 lg) or NB2 (1 lg) as indicated. At 24, 36, and 48 hpt, total RNAs were extracted and the level of EGFP mRNA was examined by Northern blotting. Cell lysates were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Flag, anti-Myc and anti-Tubulin antibodies.",

            "text": "RNAi is an antiviral immune mechanism conserved in both invertebrates and mammals. As a counter-defense to RNAi, viruses evolved to encode VSRs that were identified to target different steps of the RNAi pathway. In the present study, we screened the viral nonstructural proteins of HCV for RNAi suppression activity and found that HCV NS2 protein is a VSR. The gel shift and RNA-IP analyses show that HCV NS2 possesses both dsRNA-and siRNA-binding activities that are required for RNAi suppression. Thus, we speculate that HCV NS2 may function as VSR by shielding virus-derived dsRNA from Dicer cleavage and binding to viral siRNA to interfere with RISC assembly. In addition to NS2, HCV structural proteins core and E2 were also shown to contain RNAi suppression activity by directly targeting the protein components of the RNAi pathway (Chen et al. 2008; Ji et al. 2008) . HCV core interacts with Dicer and inhibits the siRNA production, while HCV E2 can block the RISC assembly by interacting with AGO2. Interestingly, we showed that HCV NS2 as a VSR can target the RNA components of the RNAi pathway by directly binding to dsRNA and siRNA. These results indicate that HCV can suppress antiviral RNAi at different stages by encoding multiple VSRs. This phenomenon can also be found in other RNA viruses, such as EBOV, SARS-CoV, HIV-1 and DENV (Bennasser et al. 2005; Karjee et al. 2010; Fabozzi et al. 2011; Aqil et al. 2013; Kakumani et al. 2013; Cui et al. 2015; Kakumani et al. 2015) . Thus, encoding multiple VSRs that target different steps of the RNAi pathway may offer advantages in the mode of action required for efficient suppression of RNAi, thereby highlighting the importance of the antiviral RNAi in the hostvirus interactions.",
