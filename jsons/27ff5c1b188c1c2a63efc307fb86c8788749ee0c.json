Human contact patterns are fundamental to our understanding of the dynamics of infectious disease spread [1] . Put simply, an infectious disease that spreads from person to person cannot persist unless an infected person meets a susceptible one [1, 2] . In terms of pathogens, this means that an infection that is readily spread through daily social contact does not have to last long, since an infectious person is almost certain to meet a susceptible individual within 1 day or 2 days [1] . It is not possible for each Social Contact Survey Instrument member of the population to have the same chance of meeting everyone else; instead, individuals are likely to have varying patterns of contact with one another. To gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, we need to study these contact patterns, as they are important determinants of the spread of infectious disease. Moreover, the ability to predict infectious disease spread and the impact of interventions such as vaccinations depends on whether close contacts among individuals can be quantified. Understanding the nature of human contact patterns is crucial for predicting the impact of future pandemics and for devising effective control measures [2] [3] [4] . Presently, reporting systems in many countries measure the numbers and characteristics of contact patterns in the population with the goal of controlling the spread of infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, mathematical modeling of infectious diseases transmitted by respiratory or close-contact routes (e.g., pandemic influenza) is being increasingly used to predict epidemics and to determine the impact of possible interventions [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 203, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 340, "end": 343, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 344, "end": 346, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 582, "end": 585, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1336, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1340, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1344, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1528, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1536, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1540, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1544, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1785, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In 2015, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) occurred in Korea.
