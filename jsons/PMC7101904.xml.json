Infection, drugs, malignancy, megaloblastosis, hypersplenism and immune-neutropenia are known causes of leukopenia [3].

The patient was relatively considered compliant to her medications except for her iron treatment where she only received one 100 mg tablet once or twice a week instead of daily.

There was no family history of similar conditions and there was no medical history of recurrent infections. She was compliant with taking her daily aspirin pill but had no history of other NSAID use. Her White Blood Cell (WBC) count was continuously in the range of 1,600\u20133,300 cells/\u03bcL (Reference range 4,500\u201311,000 cells/\u03bcL). With over 80 documented separate complete blood count (CBC) tests carried out throughout this 16 year period her WBC was mostly around 2,000 cells/\u03bcL. Neutrophil count was typically between 40 and 50 % which is just slightly below average range (52\u201368 %). Hemoglobin (Hb) level was continually at the lower end of normal, ranging between 9.0 and 12.0 g/dL and never exceeding 12 g/dL (Normal Reference range for females: 12.0\u201315.0 g/dL). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was usually found to be between 70 and 85 \u03bcm3 (Reference range 80\u2013100 \u03bcm3) and her ferritin level constantly remained below 15 ng/ml (Reference range 20\u2013300 ng/ml). Her platelet count was continuously between 200 \u00d7 103 and 400 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (Reference range 150\u2013450 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL). While she was receiving medical attention from our center, she had three documented visits to two different hematologists. After undergoing multiple tests, her leukopenia remained unexplained. Blood film showed microcytic hypochromic anemia with moderate neutropenia. In an effort to better understand the patient\u2019s condition, many examinations and laboratory tests were performed always resulting in normal values. The parameters evaluated included blood lead level, vitamin B-12 level, folic acid level, ESR, RF, ANA, Hb electrophoresis, serum creatinine, BUN, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, LDH, ALP, ALT, and AST. An abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable apart from some signs of mild splenomegaly. Since the patient\u2019s documented test results demonstrated the same degree of leukopenia for many years without the occurrence of significant infection, it was decided not to do bone marrow biopsy. A form of chronic benign neutropenia (also known as chronic idiopathic neutropenia) was the most likely diagnosis with Feltey\u2019s syndrome being a distant possible diagnosis. She underwent two gastroscopies and three colonoscopies throughout this 16 year period with no remarkable findings except for some mild antral gastritis. Her iron deficiency anemia was attributed to nutritional factors with no good compliance to iron treatment.",

She developed mild left sided muscle weakness and dysarthria, and was admitted to hospital for two and a half months. Her hospital stay was prolonged because her condition required daily physiotherapy, and because her swallowing ability was diminished, she was on many occasions fed using a nasogastric (N/G) tube. She received exactly the same previous oral medications through the N/G tube for her entire hospital stay. The only difference was that she was given oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg tablets twice daily for the whole two and a half months inpatient period. This was the first time our patient had ever received a full course of a proper dose of oral iron treatment which was monitored and administered by the hospital inpatient nursing staff. Strangely enough, she did not complain of constipation and gastric upset while taking the oral iron supplements during her long hospital stay, so we were for the first time able to observe the consequence of adequate iron supplementation treatment.",
