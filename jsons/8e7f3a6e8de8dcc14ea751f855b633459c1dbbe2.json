All non-urgent imaging in suspected or positive tested COVID-19 patients was avoided, if possible. The guidelines also recommended avoiding imaging procedures, when possible, that required healthcare providers in close contact with COVID-19 patients, such as ultrasound and interventional procedures. In the inpatient setting, the guidelines emphasized limiting imaging to those procedures that could not safely be performed in an outpatient setting following discharge. In particular, the judicious use of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 patients was suggested for hospitalized symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications (i.e. concern for bacterial superinfection, intubation related barotrauma, etc.).",

In addition, healthcare policies have recommended to pause elective and routine medical services, particularly surgical procedures and imaging exams. However, individual behavior and actions have also contributed to the decline in imaging case volumes. The general public is hesitant to visit any healthcare facility in fear of getting exposed to the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in particular the emergency department [7] .

The dataset was split for analysis to compare the pre-COVID-19 period (weeks 1-9) and post-COVID-19 period (weeks 10-16). In the 2019 data, week 1 was adjusted to match 4 days of imaging volume data in year 2020 for adequate comparison by eliminating January 1, 2019 imaging volumes from the data analysis. The frequency data for each week was summed for the total weeks 1-16, pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods according to patient service locations and imaging modality types. Descriptive frequency data was plotted to demonstrate the trend in the weekly imaging case volumes in year 2020 from weeks 1-16 according to patient service locations and imaging modality types, separately. The percent difference in the 2020 imaging case volumes was calculated by week for the total weeks 1-16, pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods, compared to the 2019 imaging volumes, stratified by patient service locations and imaging modality types. The difference in the imaging volumes in the 2020 calendar year were compared to the same weeks in 2019 to assess the degree of change accounting for monthly or seasonal variation within the same calendar year. The trend in the percentage of the 2020 weekly imaging case volumes, relative to 2019, was plotted from weeks 1-16 according to the patient service locations. The mean weekly imaging volumes were calculated for each imaging modality type stratified by patient service locations for the total weeks 1-16, pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods. Independent-samples t-tests were performed comparing the mean weekly imaging case volumes in year 2020 and 2019 for each imaging modality type stratified by patient service locations for the total weeks 1-16, pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods.
