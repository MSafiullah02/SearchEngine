Significant efforts have been made to develop useful methods for leachate disposition and treatment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are one of the most promising methods, because they can rapidly degrade diverse pollutants and significantly improve the biodegradability of leachate. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a fascinating conjugated polymer, has become a hot topic in AOP research due to its metalfree benefits and high photosensitivity. Thus, combining AOPs with g-C3N4 achieves excellent degradation of refractory pollutants in leachate. Since the composition of leachate is complex in the practical conditions, the information reported by current studies of using g-C3N4 as a remediator is still incomplete and fragmented. Thus, in this review, the recent status of leachate treatment and approaches for its disposal has been summarized and some conclusions have been drawn. In addition, a brief introduction to g-C3N4 and its application in AOPs for leachate treatment have been critically discussed and with its future outlook assessed. Although the development of g-C3N4 in AOPs for leachate treatment is highly efficient and practical, comprehensive study about its application and technology expansion is urgently needed, based on the complex operating conditions. Perspectives on the treatment of leachate using g-C3N4-AOPs are also included. The information and perspectives provided in this review will provide guidance and novel understanding to accelerate the development of g-C3N4-based AOPs for leachate treatment.",

Due to naturally-occurring processes like weathering and runoff, high-concentration liquid leachates are released and performed direct and potential threats to surface and subsurface water as well as flora, fauna, and human health, especially for the unlined or old landfills localized near watercourses or in wetlands (Ford et al., 2011; Lorah et al., 2009) . Therefore, Successful treatment of toxic substances in landfill leachate is a significant step towards the sustainable management of solid waste. Leachates must be carefully treated before being released into the surroundings or transferred to a secondary treatment plant. Unfortunately, in many countries and regions, leachates have been overlooked. Ford et al. conducted a field investigation to discover the source of arsenic at a Superfund site in Massachusetts (USA) and detected the presence of leachatederived arsenic in groundwater and sediment (Ford et al., 2011) . In addition, the presence of commonly used pesticide residues in concentrated leachate poses a high acute and chronic risk to the environment .",

AOPs are classified into different types, including photocatalytic oxidation, Fenton or Fenton-like processes (Gode et al., 2019) , electrochemical oxidation (Nie et al., 2016) , and persulfate-based AOPs (Roy and Moholkar, 2019; Zhou et al., 2019) . However, technical challenges limit their widespread applications. For example, although AOPs based on ozone activation have a high oxidizing capacity, the low mass transfer efficiency of ozone from the gas phase to the liquid phase and the release of excess ozone have negative impacts on the surrounding environment. In the Fenton oxidation process, the consumption of ferrous species increases the high cost of the subsequent sludge treatment, while the Fenton photo-assisted process is only effective in a narrow pH range. Electrochemical advanced oxidation requires large J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f amounts of energy and expensive metal electrodes. Among these techniques, semiconductor-induced photocatalysis has attracted significant attention because it produces large number of active radicals for eliminating recalcitrant organic pollutants and uses economical and renewable solar energy. Thus, selection of a suitable semiconductor material is essential for photocatalysis-assisted AOPs.",

Thus, tri-s-triazine is widely regarded as a promising candidate for g-C3N4-based applications (Kong et al., 2019) . Unlike conventional semiconductors (e.g. SiC, GaN, ZnO, etc.), g-C3N4 has unique stability with respect to heat treatment and chemical resistance. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of g-C3N4 suggested that g-C3N4 is not volatile at 600\u00b0C, while it can be completely decomposed at temperatures greater than 700\u00b0C (Gillan and G.; Lei et al.; Li et al.) . g-C3N4 also has high stability in extremely acidic and basic media and is insoluble in conventional solvents, including ethanol, water, tetrahydrofuran, toluene and diethyl ether. The structural stability of g-C3N4 may be due to the Van der Waals forces between the stacked graphitic layers. In addition, polymeric g-C3N4 has also attracted growing interests as semiconducting photocatalyst and has been named as the ''holy grail'' for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its facile synthesis, fascinating electronic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f band structure, reliable functionalization and unique visible-light responsiveness .",

Common methods of synthesizing g-C3N4 include thermal polymerization, solvothermal and sol-gel methods, template-assisted methods, and chemical functionalization. Among these, thermal polymerization is the most popular and commonly used method for g-C3N4 preparation, due to its outstanding technical simplicity and low costs. Therefore, the thermal polymerization method is highlighted and emphasized in this review. The thermal polymerization process is mainly achieved by thermally polymerizing nitrogen-and carbon-rich precursors. The most frequently used organic precursors include urea, melamine, trithiocyanuric acid, dicyandiamide, cyanamide, triazoles, thiourea, guanidine thiocyanate, and guanidine hydrochloride. (Sudhaik et al., 2018) . In addition, the thermal polymerization of cyanamide (CA) to synthesize g-C3N4 was discussed as an example. Different poly-condensates can coexist over a wide temperature range. When the temperature is higher than 600\u00b0C, g-C3N4 becomes unstable and partially or fully decomposes, generating NH3 and CxNyHz. Thus, thermal polymerization temperature between 550 and 600\u00b0C is generally chosen as the optimal temperature for g-C3N4 synthesis. Also, the properties of the target g-C3N4, including the surface area, porosity, absorption, photoluminescence, C/N ratio and nanostructure, can be strongly affected by the technical parameters of the thermal polymerization.",

For landfill leachate treatment, the first study using photocatalysis involved in application of TiO2 as a photocatalyst on a pilot-plant scale. In this study, humic acid (HA), a model refractory organic compound for leachate pollutants, was rapidly decolorized and degraded under sunlight (Wiszniowski et al., 2004) . These results showed that the photo-induced AOPs approach significantly shortens the subsequent biodegradation process (10 min per sample) and decreases the BOD5 (5 days). Even though TiO2 has the advantages of long-term stability and excellent results in combination with AOPs, its wide band gap, low utilization of solar energy, and fast electron-hole recombination limit its practical application. Many subsequent studies have been conducted to improve these properties, including by photocatalyst modification (decoration with metals, metal doping or heterojunction construction), technical improvements, and combination with other processes (Rocha et al., 2011; Vilar et al., 2011a; Vilar et al., 2012a; Vilar et al., 2011b; Vilar et al., 2012b) .

The known photodegradation processes performed by g-C3N4 are shown in Figure 3 , and provide theoretical evidences that g-C3N4 can generate free radicals and potentially efficiently treat leachate. As shown, during photocatalysis g-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f C3N4 is excited by absorbing photons, generating photo-induced electron-hole pairs due to the transfer of an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) (Ge et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019b) . The absorbed energy (h\u03bd) must be larger than the band gap (Eg) of g-C3N4 (\u223c2.7 eV) (Wen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2010b) . In general, during the electron transfer process, the surface electrons (e \u2212 ) and holes (h + ) serve as electron donors and acceptors for producing strongly oxidizing or reducing radical species which can directly degrade the various organic contaminants in leachate into CO2, H2O and other small molecule products. Take phenol removal by the Fe-g-C3N4 graphene hydrogel (rGH/Fe-g-C3N4) 3D structure as an example, in the presence of visible light, electrons and holes could be generated by rGH/Fe-g-C3N4. Partial electrons would quickly transfer to Fe 3+ for Fe 2+ formation, while other electrons could transfer to graphene via \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation, and thus directly decompose H2O2 to form \u00b7OH. Generated Fe 2+ can further react with H2O2 to produce \u00b7OH, which can firstly attack the ortho and para-carbons within benzene ring to form catechol and hydroquinone, subsequently open the ring to form the chain compounds and are finally mineralized into CO2 and H2O (Hu et al., 2020) .",

Although there have been no specific studies of the practical application of g-C3N4 in leachate treatment, there are sufficient available mechanisms to eliminate the contaminants that are present in leachate. Employing g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst results in high degradation performance for the recalcitrant organic pollutants in leachate under visible light . Further combining fungal degradation (using white rot fungi) with photocatalytic g-C3N4 produced superior performance for the degradation of organic compounds in leachate under visible light (Hu et al., 2017) . The white rot fungi that were used efficiently on pre-biodegradation of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f natural lignocellulosic substrates and various organic pollutants by secreting extracellular enzymes, and their spatial structure provided a large number of tiny interspaces and active reaction sites for degradation reactions. Ultimately, this combination not only achieved 74.99% organic carbon (TOC) removal (the initial TOC concentration was 100 mg L -1 ), but also showed excellent degradation potential for almost all the organic compounds present in leachate (Hu et al., 2017) . Other studies have also shown that the microbial degradation of dye-containing wastewater by photosynthetic bacteria was improved significantly due to a synergistic effect between the C16 alkane degradation performed by JLS1 bacteria and simultaneous photocatalysis by g-C3N4, Zhang et al., 2017) .",

Water disinfection and microbial control (e.g. of bacteria, viruses, and microalgae) using g-C3N4-based photocatalysts provide complementary treatment for leachate in addition to traditional water disinfection techniques. Previous studies showed that g-C3N4 possessed both excellent antibacterial and antiviral activities (Zhang et al., 2019a) , which may provide a low-cost and environmental-friendly alternative for the sustainable leachate treatment (Ong et al., 2016) . Yu et al. displayed that the high inactivation efficiency of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli, TC-E. coli) in secondary effluents could be achieved by using Ag/AgBr/g-C3N4 as the photocatalyst . In addition, Zhang et al. also found a water-surface-floating photocatalytic g-C3N4 composites (g-C3N4/EP-520) can exhibit an excellent antibacterial/ antiviral activity under visible-light irradiation, extending the application of g-C3N4-based material for water disinfection (Zhang et al., 2018) . To better meet the real demand, further studies toward an in-depth understanding of the microbial inactivation process are encouraged, while the researches about lethal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f action of photocatalysts and the vulnerable components of microbes for maximizing the inactivation efficiency are also required. Several studies have demonstrated the theoretical and technical feasibility of the application of g-C3N4 in combination with AOPS in leachate treatment. More related studies are still required to improve the understanding of the application of AOPs to leachate treatment. Table 2 presents in detail the relevant studies of the potential application of g-C3N4 in leachate treatment.",

This approach provides a new strategy for enhancing nitrate reduction in leachate and insights into the reduction mechanism . Moreover, the hazards of releasing large molecular weight organic compounds into the environment are also an important issue in leachate treatment. A magnetic fluorinated mesoporous g-C3N4 has been employed for the photocatalytic degradation of the antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) in leachate, and achieved a higher degree of mineralization with a lower accumulation of toxic by-products (Mirzaei et al., 2019) .

Coupling AOPs with other methods and technologies should be actively explored and applied in practical problem solving. Furthermore, leachate treatment using g-C3N4 should also be extended to the remediation of secondary sites, such as leachate sediment and the surrounding soil. Hopefully, this review will encourage more research into applying the robust and inexpensive g-C3N4 in photocatalytic AOPs for leachate treatment.",

The coupling of g-C3N4 with CNTs also improved the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous pollutants(Ma et al., 2014;Pei et al., 2015;Wu et al., 2015). Other g-C3N4-based nanocomposites have also been fabricated with properties enhancement, such as C60/g-C3N4 (fullerene/g-C3N4)(Bai et al., 2014;Chai et al., 2014), carbon quantum dots (CQDs)/g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposite(Li et al., 2016b;Liu et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2020) and biochar/ g-C3N4 (BC-g-C3N4)(Li et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2019b).

Pre-adsorption on activated carbon (AC) in photocatalysis increased the degradation of 1,4-dioxane and decreased the production of toxic intermediates(Nomura et al., 2020).Poblete et al. further  suggested that the use of adsorption as a pretreatment method result in a high removal rate for organic compounds and heavy metals during J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photocatalysis(Poblete et al., 2019). Ultrasound is an efficient assistance method, because it produces tiny bubbles that expand and implode in the liquid, coupled with the effects of turbulence and liquid circulation, and helped cleave H2O molecules to generate more hydroxyl radicals. Joshi and Saurabh found that combining ultrasonication with the Fenton reaction resulted in the efficient treatment of leachate (Joshi and Gogate, 2019). Anfruns et al. proposed a useful approach for efficient leachate treatment that combines AOPs with bio-anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), although it had a high nitrogen content and low BOD/N ratio. This anammox-assisted AOPs achieved a high nitrogen removal efficiency of up to90% (Anfruns et al., 2013). Furthermore, combining the Fenton reaction with membrane separation was very useful for decreasing membrane fouling and provided complementary treatment for leachate and produced effluent with contaminant contents that met the required regulatory levels for environmental release(Moravia et al., 2013).",
