Statistically, malaria causes an economic loss of 12 billion US dollars every year in African countries [4]. Seasonal influenza in the US causes an annual economic burden of 87 billion US dollars [7]. The developments in vaccines and drugs have enabled us to combat infectious diseases and have greatly reduced the harm brought to human society. However, the sudden emerging infectious diseases caused by the drug resistance and the inherent variability of viruses still remains to be a serious global problem that often leaves us in an unprepared and vulnerable situation. For example, the H1N1 flu in 2009 mutated to become the H7N9 flu in 2014 and the H3N2 flu in 2015. The H3N2 virus began to spread through contact networks in Hong Kong in January 2015, and 122 lives were taken in just one month [8]. The death toll rose to 591 after three months. Thus, in the fight against various kinds of infectious diseases, relying solely on vaccine development is far from enough. A more effective \u201cactive prevention and control\u201d method is desperately needed so as to rapidly detect and block the transmission paths of new infectious diseases, detaining the disease to a minimum spread until its eradication.",

In computational epidemiology, a contact is simply defined either as a direct physical interaction (e.g. sexual contact) or proximity interaction (e.g. to people being within 1m of each other, or being in the same room) [9]. Human contact interactions constitutes a \u201ccontact network\u201d of virus transmission. In this network, nodes represent individuals, and links represent contact relationships. The structure of the contact network significantly affects the spatiotemporal patterns of virus spread. For example, in the case of respiratory infections that spread through droplets, interactions like face-to-face communication, shaking hands, crowd gathering, and sharing vehicles enable the spread of diseases and increase the possibilities of transmission from infected to susceptible persons. Tracking the contact interactions of individuals can effectively restore the \u201cinvisible\u201d virus transmission paths, quickly locate and isolate high-risk individuals who were in contact with infected persons, and can aid in quantitative analysis of the transmission paths, processes, and trends of the infectious diseases, all leading to the development of corresponding effective epidemic control strategies.",

Because contact interactions between individuals are diverse and often subtle, they are difficult to be directly observed and recorded. In other words, it is hard to obtain first-hand high-quality data for contact tracking. When a disease is spreading, the impact of the disease could be observed, instead of the underlying direct interactions between individuals. For example, during the outbreak of H7N9 bird flu, it is difficult to identify who were infected due to contacts with certain infected people. As shown in Fig. 1, only new H7N9 cases and the number of deaths in different time and space can be observed.\n",

To reveal the spread patterns of HIV infection and AIDS in the U.S., Fay et al. analyzed the patterns of same-gender sexual contact among men using the data developed from a national sample survey in 1970 and 1988, respectively. They found that at least 20.3 percent of adult men have had sexual contact with another man in life, and never-married men are more likely to have same-gender sexual contacts [34]. Similarly, Merino et al.\n[35] sampled 294 homosexual men from Colombia as volunteers to answer questionnaires on sexual practices. Analysis of these questionnaires suggests two significant risk factors for HIV-1 infection: 1) having sexual contact with foreign visitors; 2) having more than ten homosexual partners. They suggest that the spread of HIV-1 infections should be monitored at the international level and more attention should be paid to these subgroups with high transmission rates.",

In the Swiss Cohort Study on April 1, 2000, Wolf et al.\n[36] investigated the unsafe behavior among 4948 HIV-infected individuals by self-reported questionnaire. However, after adjustment for covariate, it reported that unsafe sex is associated with other factors, e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, status of partner, having occasional partners, living alone, etc. In recent years, researchers designed questionnaires to measure the validity and reliability of sexual abstinence and avoidance of high-risk situations. For example, Najarkolaei et al.\n[37] sampled 348 female undergraduate students from Tehran University, Iran, and assessed the validity and reliability of the designed sex, behavioral abstinence, and avoidance of high-risk situation. Zhang et al.\n[38] surveyed 250 HIV-positive persons on their socio-demographic characteristics and sexual behavior, and traced HIV infection status of 431 persons who had heterosexual contact with the HIV carriers. Among these 431 persons, 59 were HIV-positive, i.e., the secondary attack rate was 13.7%. Therefore, they appeal to improve the knowledge about HIV/AIDS, enhance psychological education, and promote the use of condom, so as to suppress the transmission of HIV.",

The Zika virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes. However, by reviewing the travel experience and sexual intercourse of infected individuals in the US, researchers confirmed that there were 14 cases of Zika virus infection were transmitted by sexual contact [40]. For instance, a person in Texas was getting infected with the Zika virus after sexual contact with someone who had acquired the infection while travelling abroad [41]. In 2012, Molinari et al.\n[7] investigated the contact interactions of 1,074 students in a high school through questionnaires. A local campus contact network was established based on information such as the length of contact time and contact frequency.

Influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks on a large scale every year in many countries, recording and detecting ILI are important public health problems. Flutracking, a weekly web-based survey of ILI in Australia, has been used to record the past and current influenza immunization status of participants in winter influenza seasons for many years [43]. It only takes the participants less than 15 seconds to complete the survey, including documenting symptoms, influenza vaccination status, and mobility behaviors such as time off work or normal duties. In 2008, the peak week detected by Flutracking was 31 August, which was contemporaneous with that in other influenza surveillance systems [44]. For the first three years being applied, the participants increased from 394 to 982 and 4,872 in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, due to its convenience in completing the survey and its accuracy in detecting the peak week of influenza activity. Flutracking also provides vaccine effectiveness analysis by investigating the status of vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. In 2012, the ILI weekly incidence peaked in mid-July in the unvaccinated group, 1 month earlier than vaccinated group confirmed by national influenza laboratory [45]. In recent years, by cooperating with the health department, organizational email systems, and social media, Flutracing gained over 1000 new participants each year by sending invitations from existing participants. As a result, the number of online participants in Flutracing has exceeded 26,000 in 2016 [43].",

The researchers collected the contact information of 36 users on the Cambridge University campus with this software and established the contact network between different users at different times. Then, they simulated an influenza outbreak on this network using a SEIR model. In view that the large power consumption of GPS and Bluetooth resulted in short standby time of mobile phones, Yoneki and Crowcroft [17] further developed a new contact tracking application, EpiMap, using wearable sensors, which had lower power consumption and longer standby time.

For example, MIT Media Lab researchers Nathan Eagle and Alex Pentland proposed the reality mining method as early as 2006. This method suggests the use of wearable wireless sensors to record people\u2019s daily activities [13], [14]. They developed an experimental system to record the activities of several MIT students in a teaching building over time, and then established a small social network describing their contact relationships [15]. Salath\u00e9 et al.\n[18] collected the contact interactions of 788 students in a high school in the United States for one day using wireless sensors, and they established an individual-based campus contact network. It was found that the campus contact network had high density connectivity and a small-world structure [19]. However, it is costly to trace contact interactions using wearable wireless sensors, especially when the number of individuals being monitored is large. Moreover, people wearing wearable wireless sensors are very conspicuous, participants are unwilling to wear such devices due to privacy concerns especially for patients.",

Similarly, Yoneki [16] collected students\u2019 contact data from a French primary school using radiofrequency identification devices. More recently, in October 2016, IBM researchers Kurien and Shingirirai from Africa Labs invented a radio tag designed to extend tracker working distance, and implemented it in tracking tuberculosis (Fig. 2) [6]. Each tag contains a tiny sensor, a storage device, and a battery. Radio tags can communicate with each other, allowing individuals\u2019 contact interactions to be recorded when two tags are in close proximity. The contact data collected by the radio tags is presented in a three-dimensional visualization system. Using of the intelligent data analysis method provided by the system, medical staff can view the spatiotemporal distribution of tuberculosis patients in real time, track the transmission paths of tuberculosis, and find high-risk populations. Because of the high cost of tuberculosis vaccines, contact data can also aid in the determination of high-priority vaccinations. However, the traditionally used radiofrequency tracker has a limited transmission and receiving range and only works within a small area.\n",

With the aged tendency of population, tracing mobility behavior is critical for measuring, describing, and comparing mobility patterns in older adults. For example, Hirsch et al.\n[47] investigated the mobility patterns using GPS tracing data collected from 95 older adults in Vancouver, Canada, with the goal of understanding neighborhood influences on older adults\u2019 health. They found that participants who were younger tend to drive more frequently and live far from their neighborhoods. GPS devices have also been used for tracing physical activities of adolescents in school and other social settings [48]\u2013[50]. For instance, Rodriguez et al.\n[49] sampled 293 adolescent females in Minneapolis and San Diego, USA, and traced their physical activity and sedentary behaviors by GPS every 60s in different settings. Physical activities were more likely to occur in parks, schools, and places with high population density during weekend, less to occur in places with roads and food outlets. Besides, tracing animals in the sea or on the land using GPS devices can obtain detailed spatiotemporal data regarding the movement patterns. For instance, Dujon et al.\n[51] traced a green turtle travelling more than 300002km across the Indian Ocean and obtained more than 450,2000 locations. Moreover, by tracing the whole-body motion dynamics of a cheetah using GPS devices, Patel et al.\n[52] illuminated the factors that influence performance in legged animals.",

A total of 97,904 contact records were collected. They found that contact interactions have significant spatial heterogeneity, with most individual contacts occurring at home (23%), work (21%), school (14%), places of entertainment (16%), and while using transportation (3%). Further, contact structures under different scenarios have obvious differences. There are some age-related contact patterns: in many scenarios (such as in schools), individuals are more likely to contact people of similar age; most of the contact between children and their parents occurs at home, while most contacts for adults occur in workplaces. The researchers thus divided the population into several meta-populations, establishing a composite group model based on age. Interaction probabilities between different age groups were estimated according to questionnaire data (Fig. 4), and a contact network based on composite groups was established.\n",

Additionally, government-imposed epidemic-control strategies can significantly change individuals\u2019 contact patterns [17], [23], [24], [30].

Offline and online questionnaires are incapable of recording real-time contact information, and usually time delayed to receive feedback from participants. Automatic contact tracing methods such as mobile phone, wearable wireless sensor, RFID, and GPS devices can collect continuous mobility information [53], [60]. However, all these methods are limited to monitoring mobility behaviors for small-scale population, due to the large consumption of power, short range of positioning, high cost of money, etc. Besides, most people cannot be expected to agree to have their dynamic contact interactions monitored in real time because of privacy issue. For example, wearing a tracker can also be equated to declaring one\u2019s self an infectious disease patient. Tuberculosis patients in African countries are branded with social prejudice, making wearing an identifier a sensitive issue [6].
