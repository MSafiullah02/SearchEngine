In this paper, we present our results from applying M&S on the city of Casablanca, Morocco to comprehend (i): How it can be relatively easy or difficult for such pandemic to penetrate to the studied region (country, city, district, etc.). (ii): How it can spread relatively fast or slow within that region. And finally (iii): What is the optimal strategy for containing and mitigating the propagation of the disease while still keeping the economy as near to normal as possible.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is certainly one of the worst pandemics ever. As of 20 April 2020, the virus has generated over 2 million of confirmed infected cases and 150 thousand deaths [1] . In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing in order to isolate the infected people, quarantine and social distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections as much as possible and as soon as possible. But, the economical harm of these measurements is estimated to be much more than that of the economical crisis of 2008 [2] . On the other hand, some studies [3] suggest that quarantine and social distancing measures might be needed for as long as 18 months, and will only be turned on and off alternatively during that period. In order to get a better understanding and make quick and optimal reactions to the current situation, many researchers have decided to exploit the various M&S tools and techniques [4] [5] [6] . In this paper, we aim to explain through M&S the current situation of the Covid 19 pandemic in Casablanca, Morocco, in order to reinforce the \"so far\" efficient measures, and also suggest a context tailored optimal strategy of release in order to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus while keeping the economy as near to normal as possible.",

Casablanca has eight districts (see figure 1 ), each district in Casablanca has its own demographic characteristics such as population size, density and dynamics but they don't differ that much. What might be the main difference between them is the type of each district (industrial, downtown, etc.)). But to summarize all briefly, there are three categories: 1 st category: Casa Anfa district serves as the city's economic and administrative center, cultural identifier, and historical birthplace. 2 nd category: The three districts Ain Sbaa, Ain Chock and Bernoussi are host to lots of industrial areas and businesses. Each category of districts maps into one of three classes, this classification is based on the number of transportations quantity and means provided for a certain district and also on the number of reasons people would go there, such as super market, work, hospitals, etc. which can be found in the official website of the administrative division of Casablanca One thing to mention, this is not because people from these two districts respected the lockdown measurements the most. In fact the number of reported violations of the measurements is the highest among those two districts more than others. So why this is the case! Given that all districts have quite similar demographics, everyone expect that the one that starts first should be at the top of the ranking list.",

Being as dynamic as such places, the contact rate tend to be much higher, inducing a high infection rate per period. Now Casa Anfa should be shut down. Consequently, economy will decline, thus no budget to buy health equipments and eventually the mortality rate will get very high. And same logic goes for the work places, it just would be a little lower because not everyone works in the same place but instead the effect is distributed among all three districts.",

Therefore, a considerable number of people spend most of the daytime in other four districts and not in their districts, and only after 6PM that they return. And because of lockdown measures, after 6PM no one is allowed to stay out, thus, the coming back people goes right to their homes after spending the whole daytime in their work places.",

Not only that, but it also helped us to suggest what might be the optimal policy in order to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus while still maintaining the global economy as near to normal as possible.

III. THE CURRENT SITUATION OF COVID 19 IN CASABLANCA The table below shows the number of the infected people in each district as of 19 April 2020.

It is actually what made us question the hidden reasons why some districts are much more impacted than others even if they are near to each other. For example, Mers Sultan district happened to be located right between the two most infected districts among all, yet it is surprisingly at the bottom of the ranking table.IV. MAKING SENSE OF THE DATA 1) First simulation: Surely, by now everyone interested in modeling and simulation of Covid 19 has seen the Washington Post article byHarry Stevens [8]. Inspired by it, we considered each district in our previous map (figure 1) as a box containing 100 agents bouncing around randomly with 50% immobility. If there is one thing we should learn from this simulation, is that the number of infected people next day depends mainly on: (i) the initial number of infectious people and (ii) the contact rate (i.e. density and movement rate).",
