            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes an acute and highly contagious viral disease of chickens that is characterized by respiratory signs, nephritis, and reduced egg reproduction (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Among the IBV structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit is responsible for attachment to the host cellular membrane, induction of neutralization, and hemagglutination of inhibiting antibodies (Casais et al., 2003, Cavanagh, 2007). Because of the high rates of S1 gene mutation, a number of IBV serotypes or antigenic variant strains have been reported in many countries (Cavanagh, 2007). Moreover, another evolutionary process involving recombination between co-circulating heterotypic IBV strains has increased the genetic diversity of IBV viruses (Lee and Jackwood, 2000). However, not all recombinant strains of IBV cause epidemics. While most recombinant strains have disappeared due to the unfitness for the host environment, some strains, such as GA98 strain derived from DE072 (Lee et al., 2001), have continuously persisted in the field long enough to maintain an epidemic (Lee and Jackwood, 2001).",

Despite extensive vaccination, IBV infection has remained a problem in the Korean poultry industry (Lee et al., 2004). Since the early 1990s, Korean nephropathogenic IBV, represented by the KM91 strain, has exacted economic losses in Korea (Kim et al., 2004). New nephropathogenic IBVs related to the QXIBV strain originating from China have been introduced and become wide-spread since 2000 (Lee et al., 2008). More recently, we isolated new IBV strains that formed a new gene cluster in the phylogenetic tree of the IBV S1 gene. These new strains have been continuously isolated in Korea over time and outbreaks have been increasing annually. Nevertheless, the genetic features of these IBV strains are still unknown.",

The recombination breakpoints were determined by the maximization of \u03c7\n2 analysis (Lole et al., 1999). The parental strain KM91 was replaced with QXIBV when the 10 IBV isolates were queried. The S1 gene sequences of nine IBV isolates (K1585/07, K183/07, K426/08, K33/09, K40/09, K74/09, K344/09, K88/10 and K147/10) exhibited greater affinity with one putative parent QXIBV strain before the break point (861 bp), while the S1 gene shared higher sequence similarity with the KM91 strain after position 861 bp (Fig. 3A). The S1 gene sequence of the K716/05 strain exhibited greater affinity with one putative parent QXIBV strain in the region from 1 to 1118, while the S1 gene shared higher sequence similarity with the KM91 strain after position 1118 bp (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, when phylogenetic trees inferred for nucleotide sequences of each recombination region in the S1 gene of IBV isolates were constructed, a significant discrepancy was found between these phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). These findings also provide important evidence that IBV isolates descended from two putative parents, the KM91-like and QXIBV-like subgroups.",

In particular, the use of live vaccines could produce new variant viruses by recombination with field strains resulting from the spread of vaccine strains (Farsang et al., 2002). In this study, the result of recombination analysis provided the evidence that homologous recombination had occurred in the IBV isolates (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). However, the Mass type strain has only been used in Korea as a live vaccine before the use of a nephropathogenic strain of live-attenuated IBV vaccine was begun in 2010 (Lee et al., 2010). Furthermore, the IBV isolates in this study were obtained prior to the use of nephropathogenic strain of live-attenuated IBV vaccine, and they were almost always isolated from unvaccinated broiler chickens. Therefore, the new IBV isolates might have been generated naturally by recombination resulting from co-circulation of KM-91 like and QX-like field strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural recombination among nephropathogenic IBV strains in Korea.",

However, presently, the two crossover sites were located at a conserved sequence within the hypervariable region. Especially, most of the IBV isolates experienced crossover events at nucleotide 861 of the S1 gene (Fig. 3), indicating that this site may serve as a possible region for template switching in viral RNA synthesis and is a breakpoint candidate for genetic recombination within the S1 gene of Korean nephropathogenic IBV strains. In addition, considering the fact that genetic recombination of IBV can occur in multiple genes (Chen et al., 2009, Kuo et al., 2010, Mase et al., 2009), further studies involving recombination events in several genes might provide more information about the genetic characterization of IBV isolates.",

For instance, the EJ95 recombinant strain disappeared from Korea due to unfitness for the host environment (Song and Lee, 2000), while the GA98 strain has continuously persisted in the field long enough to maintain an epidemic in North America (Lee, 2002). Unpublished results from an epidemiological investigation have shown that the IBV isolates used in this study were isolated continuously in different regions of Korea from 2005 to 2010, and that outbreaks of these isolates have been increasing annually. These observations support the possibility that IBV recombinant strains have the potential to spread widely and cause epidemics in chickens. In addition, since the S protein of coronavirus is related to host range and cell tropism (Casais et al., 2003, Kuo et al., 2000), alterations in the pathogenic and antigenic characteristic in IBV isolates could be expected. How recombinant strains from heterologous strains demonstrate tissue tropism or pathogenicity in a host is not clear, but it has been reported that vaccination with commercial vaccines does not ensure complete protection against challenge with recombinant strains (Liu et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2009). Therefore, further studies should investigate the cross-protective efficacy of commercial IBV vaccines against these isolates for effective control of IB in Korea.",
