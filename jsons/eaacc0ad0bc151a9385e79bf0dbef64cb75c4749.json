            "text": "Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reminds us of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and up to date, corticosteroid is commonly administrated to severe patients with COVID-19. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by traditional Chinese medicine, and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. Participants and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (9 males and 24 females) with bilateral steroidassociated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for 6 months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of 1 year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results: Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from 6 to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 precollapse hips (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse (ARCO Stage III or IV). Only five patients (also 5 hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.",

Similarly, no specific therapy is available for the coronavirus [1] . It is estimated that corticosteroid therapy was administrated to 18% of COVID-19 patients, with a higher percentage among those with severe disease (44%) than nonsevere disease (13%) [2] . Osteonecrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and depression are commonly seen among convalescent SARS patients. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in SARS survivors could be attributed to the steroid because high cumulative doses of steroids were closely associated with the occurrence of osteonecrosis [3] . Steroid-associated ONFH can progressively break down the underlying bone of the hip joint and thus induce severe premature osteoarthritis of the hip, which would further cause physical disability in these SARS survivors [4] .",

Disappointingly, a meta-analysis published in 2019 had concluded that postmarketing drugs, including enoxaparin, statins, bisphosphonates, iloprost and acetylsalicylic acid, were not recommendable for this disease [7] . One of the reasons why these single-component drugs fail to take effect is that steroid-associated ONFH is a multifactorial disease with complex signal pathways involved [8] . This mechanism explains the fact that not all individuals who continue long-term steroid therapy develop steroid-associated ONFH. Chinese medicine may be a potential solution for steroid-associated ONFH, because it is based on network pharmacology through a network-target and multicomponents mechanism [9] .",

            "text": "Huo-Gu formula (HGF) is a Chinese herbal medication that is commonly administrated for patients with ONFH in China. Abnormal lipid metabolism has been reported to be involved in the development of ONFH [15] , and the TCM theory believes that phlegm-dampness (Tan--Shi) pathogen is closely associated with the abnormal lipid metabolism [16] . The main TCM function of HGF is to help invigorate the spleen (Pi) to clear dampness, resolve phlegm and activate blood circulation. Previous animal testing had found an allopathic effect of HGF on preventing steroid-treated animals from developing steroid-associated ONFH [17, 18] . Interestingly, we found that HGF also helps improve lipoprotein metabolism [17, 18] . Further experiments found that the ethyl acetate fraction of HGF helps inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of the bone marrow stromal cells [19] whereas the aqueous fraction of HGF promotes the osteogenic differentiation [20] . Here, we conducted a long-term retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes of HGF therapy for steroid-associated ONFH in convalescent SARS patients with an average of 14 years.",

The phlegm-dampness pathogen affects mainly the lower part of the body. The hip (femoral head) is among the most susceptible joints to the phlegm-dampness pathogen. Once the phlegm-dampness pathogen affects the femoral head, the circulation of \"Qi\" and \"Blood\" along the meridian around the hip is to be disturbed.

In the present study, we observed 14 new collapse cases (26.41%) in 53 patients with precollapse ONFH. According to a systematic review published in 2010, which studied the natural history of 598 hips with ONFH, the overall collapse rate was 49.00% after a mean follow-up duration of 4 years [27] . In 2019, Wei et al. [10] reported a collapse rate of 22.00% in 59 patients receiving oral administration of Huo Xue Tong Luo Capsule (a Chinese medication) after a mean follow-up duration of 4.38 years.

The goal of hip-preserving treatments is not only to avoid or delay THA, but also to maintain or restore the physical function of the hip joint. HHS is an outcome measure frequently used for evaluation of the physical function among patients with hip joint disorders [28, 29] . We observed a mean HHS of 63.89 AE 10.30 in 28 patients without THA at the end of the present study. Although the data suggest that HGF therapy only yields poor results (HHS < 70), but our data are still comparable to previous relevant studies [30] [31] [32] [33] . Alendronate is one of the most commonly used pharmacological treatments for ONFH [34] . In 2005, an RCT study included 20 patients who received 25-week alendronate treatment, reported a mean HHS of 74.4 AE 7.8 after a follow-up duration 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67 of 2 years [32] . However, the efficacy of alendronate for treating ONFH has been questioned by later studies [35, 36] . Core decompression is believed to be the most reliable operative treatment for precollapse ONFH [37] . Even so, an RCT study published in 2017 reported a mean HHS of 68 AE 5 in 21 patients who had undergone core decompression surgery at 3 years follow-up visit [33] .",

            "text": "A significant limitation of our study is the lack of SARS patients with or without medical interventions as control. However, there is still no treatment-as-usual available, and it would not have been ethical to give placebo treatment as well. A similar study reported combined vasoactive pharmacotherapy could successfully prevent collapse, but their 14-year study only included four SARS patients [39] . On the other hand, few randomised clinical trials concerning ONFH can be followed up for a long term. Published studies mostly reported their results after a follow-up duration of only 2 or 3 years [4, 33, 40] , but the previous study had reported that the interval between diagnosis and collapse could be over 4 years in 46% of cases [41] . In comparison to the natural collapse rate of 49% reported by a systematic review that included the most hips with ONFH [27] , our study observed a collapse rate of 26% based on prolonged follow-up data, supporting that HGF helps prevent the natural disease progression of ONFH.",
