Conventional therapy for patients with CRC is based on total or partial colectomy, usually followed by neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy [3] with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and/or taxanes [4]. The success of chemotherapy is often complicated by metastases and relapsing disease associated with the development of drug resistance [5]. One of the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance is autophagy, a selective cellular degradation process in which cytosolic proteins and organelles are sequestered into double-membrane autophagosomes that fuse with lysosome for the recycling of macromolecules [6], [7]. This process is also triggered to generate amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids under conditions of nutrient deprivation [8]. Other types of stress can also trigger autophagy, such as genomic stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, intracellular infections, and exposure to drugs [9].",

Treatment of HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells with a nontoxic concentration of paclitaxel alters the expression of several genes, especially those responsible for the synthesis of heat shock proteins, components of the antigen processing machinery (APM) and tumor-associated antigens [11]. The increased immunogenicity of tumor cells induced by drug exposure is dependent on the onset of so-called immunogenic cell death, with increased expression of danger signals (e.g., danger-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs) such as calreticulin, heat shock proteins, ATP, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Consistent with this notion, we also observed that exposing HCT-116 cells to a nontoxic concentration of paclitaxel or doxorubicin causes transcriptional alterations in several genes associated with the expression of tumor antigens [17]. In addition, dendritic cells (DCs) sensitized with the lysate of HCT-116 cells that were previously treated with low concentrations of paclitaxel induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with higher lytic potential than did the DCs sensitized with untreated tumor cells [17].",

            "text": "More recently, combining antineoplastic agents with autophagy blockers as a therapeutic approach for treating cancer patients has been proposed. Exposing human colorectal cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) enhances autophagy in a considerable portion of these cells [18]. Exposure of these cells to the antimalarial drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine, or mefloquine (quinolones) reduces autophagy and increases the susceptibility of cells to chemotherapy [19]. Quinolones function as weak bases that passively diffuse into the lysosomes where they are protonated and prevented from leaving this vesicle. Their presence increases the lysosome pH, interrupting its functions and preventing the end of autophagy [20], [21]. As anti-inflammatory drugs, quinolones have been used to treat some autoimmune diseases [22]. Currently, there are a number of clinical trials and experimental studies focusing on the feasibility of using CQ and hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) [23], [24] . In addition, the combination of CQ and antineoplastic drugs enhances the clinical response in patients with breast [25] and kidney cancer [26], showing a synergistic effect on the activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), inhibiting autophagy, and thus increasing tumor cell death. No studies on the induction of autophagy in tumor cells treated with ultra-low doses of chemotherapeutic agents are available, and little is known about the effect of this phenomenon on the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, there are no reports on the effects of using CQ combined with other drugs on the functions of immunocompetent cells such as lymphocytes or DCs.",

These cells were authenticated as mycoplasma-free and were cultured in 150 cm2 culture bottles in RMPI-1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics solution (Life Technologies). The cells were cultured at 37\u02daC under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 24 h of culturing, the cells were treated with 80 \u00b5M CQ for 18 h, and then the minimum effective concentration of 5-fluorouracil (20 \u00b5M) (Eurofarma) was added and the cells were cultured for a further 24 h.

In the 5-FU + CQ combined treatment, the size of autophagosomes appeared to increase within the cytoplasm, and these vesicles exhibited different filler contents. Some vesicles had heterogeneous electron-dense material inside them, and others showed myelin figures and electron-lucent degraded material, indicating that some autophagosomes were not engaged in the digestion process and that the process of digestion was blocked.

Cells treated with 5-FU showed an evident increase in the number of autophagolysosomes containing degraded material, indicating the induction of autophagy and the completion of the process, consistent with prior reports [28], [29], [30], [37], [38]. The combined treatment of CQ and 20 \u00b5M 5-FU induced intense accumulation of cytoplasmic vesicles in several stages, especially autophagosomes containing undigested material. We also found cells with signs of autophagic and apoptotic death, such as cytoplasmic vacuolization, chromatin rarefaction (reduction of heterochromatic groups associated with the nuclear envelope), altered mitochondrial morphology (dilation of the cristae), and dilation of the nuclear envelope, which also agrees with previous reports [39], [40]. This phenomenon was confirmed by the observation that CQ + 5-FU treatment strongly reduced cell proliferation and induced early apoptosis in tumor cells, although CQ or 5-FU alone had no apparent effect on cell viability. 5-Fluorouracil induces apoptosis in cancer cells [41], and the inhibition of autophagy by CQ can potentiate the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. This occurs because the accumulation of vesicles in the cytoplasm due to incomplete autophagy can cause oxidative stress and lead to cell death. Based on this information, we aimed to confirm whether the toxicity of low 5-FU concentrations would be enhanced by CQ. In this study, the apoptosis and cell death results showed that 5-FU + CQ increased the levels of early apoptosis even though the drug concentrations had only a negligible effect if applied alone.",

DC maturation is required for increased antigen-presenting ability and is accompanied by phenotypic changes, such as increased expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecule expression. CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression are essential for T lymphocyte stimulation [42]. In addition to being a maturation marker, CD83 modulates the immune response by stimulating both naive and memory T cells [43]. CD83 expression was also enhanced by the drug combination. Although apoptotic cell death is considered non-immunogenic or weakly immunogenic, it is possible that apoptosis induced by the blockage of autophagy results in the expression of danger signals (e.g., DAMPs) that are usually not expressed during physiological apoptosis. In a parallel study, we observed that exposing HCT-116 cells to low concentrations of paclitaxel induces the expression of HSP-70 and 90 (unpublished data). In the present study, we observed a small increase in the expression of HSP-70 but irrelevant changes in the HSP-90 and HMGB genes. These findings indicated that the enhanced ability to sensitize DCs is mainly due to the increased expression of the tumor-associated genes of the CEA family (CEACAM 1, 5, 6, and 7).",

Exposing tumor cells to other drugs such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin increases the expression of the antigen processing machinery via the cytosolic route, such as TAP1, tapasin, and calnexin [11]. This view is reinforced by the observation that chemical stress triggers the cell surface expression of calreticulin (CALR) [12], another molecule promoting the antigenic processing of tumor cells. Interestingly, CALR moves from the endoplasmic reticulum (where it functions as an APM component) to the cytoplasmic membrane, where it serves as a potent activating signal. CALR, together with HMGB1, plays an important role in the phenotypic maturation of DCs, increasing HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86 expression and functional maturation, as well as enhancing the secretion of IL-12 and INF-\u03b3 [45].",

Aiming to confirm that the combination of 5-FU and CQ can stimulate the proliferation of CD8+ lymphocytes, we performed a CTL assay, which, unlike the MLR, tests the ability of DCs to stimulate the proliferation of autologous CD8+ lymphocytes that target tumor cells [46]. Our main difficulty when evaluating the direct cytotoxicity of CTLs against target cells is that HCT-116 cells are adherent, but most available assays for this purpose work well for cells in suspension and are not reliable for adherent cell types. There are some chemiluminescence-based assays for this, but we were unable to acquire the appropriate kit. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the expression of perforin and granzyme B by CTLs challenged with tumor target cells, following the methodology proposed by Betts et al [47]. These proteins are considered to be functional markers in cells with cytotoxic capacity [48]; perforin polymerization perforates the target cell membrane, while granzyme B induces apoptosis [49]. As expected, we found increased expression (i.e., increased mean fluorescence intensity; MFI) of both perforin and granzyme B in the CD8+ population induced by DCs sensitized with 5-FU + CQ lysate.",

Consistently, lymphocytes stimulated with DCs exposed to 5-FU + CQ lysates induced earlier and more potent T cell activation. The findings also indicated that there was no selective activation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, since the percentage of CD69+ cells was increased in both subpopulations. Accordingly, these same treatments resulted in a reduced generation of PD-1+ cells among CD4+ T lymphocytes. PD-1 is a member of the CD28 family, and its primary function is to limit clustering of the TCR and costimulatory molecules within the immunologic synapse. PD-1 expression is increased in the T cells of patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and various leukemias and lymphomas [51]. Therefore, PD-1 expression in T cells and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells constitute a tumor escape mechanism. We observed reduced PD-1 expression on the expanding lymphocytes cocultured with DCs. This aspect is particularly interesting because the signals associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 are among the main checkpoint blockades of the antitumor response. Hence, in addition to the anti-CTLA-4 antibody, the anti-PD-1 antibodies [52] are mainstays of modern antitumor immunotherapy.",

            "text": "The lymphocytes cultured with DCs sensitized with drug-exposed tumor cells produced higher amounts of IFN-\u03b3 than controls while showing decreased production of IL-10. Naive CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes can differentiate into specific effector T cells with different functions that are attributed, in part, to the pattern of cytokines they produce [53]. CD4+ T cells can differentiate into Th1 cells that release IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 to stimulate the generation of CD8+ cells; in this way, Th1 cells are involved in the development of the antitumor immune response. Interferon \u03b3 also recruits monocytes, inducing the differentiation of CD4+ T lymphocytes into Th1 lymphocytes [54], [55]. IL-10 is a DC-inhibiting cytokine that can be secreted by both Tregs and Th2, inhibiting antigen presentation, and decreasing the expression of MHC II and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 [56]. Thus, DCs under the combined treatment promoted preferential activation of Th1 lymphocytes, with little Th2 or Treg stimulation. An analysis of other cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-2, TNF, IL-4, IL-6, IL17, and IL-23, would be useful to provide a clearer view regarding how the different treatments affect the modulation of T cell subsets. The quantification of these cytokines should be considered in future studies.",
