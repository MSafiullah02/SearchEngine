In our study, 94\u00b78% (n=9,683) wore masks of which 83\u00b77% wore disposable surgical masks. However, 13\u00b70% wore them incorrectly; with 35\u00b75% worn 'inside-out' or 'upside-down'; and 42\u00b75% worn too low, exposing the nostrils or mouth. Many individuals who did not wear masks were smoking, eating, or covering their mouth and nose with tissues or hands.

Among them (n=2,859), 94\u00b71% believed mass masking reduces the chance of infection and community outbreak. Intriguingly, 76\u00b73% of respondents reused their masks. Clearly, there is a need for public education on measures to prevent self-contamination; and on the method of mask usage in order not to waste resources. We examined the packaging of different brands of surgical mask sold locally, and very few provided instructions on correct usage. Although instructions were previously considered unnecessary as the face mask was intended for use by healthcare professionals, many users now are the lay public. While the local health authority has revised its guidelines to recommend wearing masks in the community, details on the correct usage and handling are insufficient.",
