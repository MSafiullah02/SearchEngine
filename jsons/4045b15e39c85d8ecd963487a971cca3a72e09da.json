            "text": "The type I interferon response (IFN response) is an important part of the immune reaction against viruses. Interferon alpha and beta (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) are the prototypical type I interferons and can be produced by most animal cells. Production of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is triggered upon stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll like receptors (TLRs) or Rig-I like receptors (RLRs). Upon production, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 are rapidly secreted to the extracellular compartment, where they can bind to the ubiquitously expressed IFN receptor. Binding of IFN to the receptor activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, leading to the formation of the ISGF3 transcription complex consisting of a STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. In the nucleus, the ISGF3 complex induces transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [1] . Many of these genes encode proteins that interfere with the replicative cycle of viruses at various stages (reviewed in ref. 2) . The IFN response is a potent antiviral mechanism, and therefore, most viruses have been evolutionarily selected to counteract it and coronaviruses are no exception (reviewed by Zhong et al. [3] ).",

We have found these protocols useful to study if and how viruses counteract the IFN response in chicken cells. The first protocol describes how to quantify activation of the IFN response at the transcriptional level using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) on Ifn and IFN-stimulated genes. The second protocol describes quantification of bioactive type-I IFN protein (both IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) by the use of a reporter cell line. This bioassay can be used to quantify IFN secreted in response to virus infection and, when combined with transcription analysis of Ifn\u03b1 and Ifn\u03b2 these assays can provide an integral picture of activation of the chicken IFN response.",

            "text": "Similar to most mammalian cell lines, activation of the interferon response in most chicken cells is characterized by upregulation of Ifn\u03b2. Like the human genome, the chicken genome encodes only one copy of the Ifn\u03b2 gene, whereas at least ten isoforms of Ifn\u03b1 are present [4, 5] . Similar to mammals, production of chicken IFN\u03b1 is mainly mediated by monocytes; other cells mainly produce IFN\u03b2 in response to viral infection [6] . Because avian coronaviruses replicate mainly in epithelial cells, we monitor activation of the type I interferon response by quantification of Ifn\u03b2. Similar to mammalian cells, Ifn\u03b2 is upregulated upon activation of either TLR or Rig-I like receptors (RLRs), but not in response to stimulation with IFN. Concomitant with Ifn\u03b2, many ISGs are also upregulated, indicating that the term interferon stimulated genes is somewhat misleading [7] . Studying the expression of ISGs can be useful, therefore we have provided a list of avian-specific primers for use in real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR; Table 1 ) [8] [9] [10] . Protocols for RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR are plenty and every lab has its own protocols. In this chapter we describe briefly the methods used in our lab. For a detailed overview of RT-qPCR techniques and theoretical background, please refer to Forlenza et al. [11] .",

To select the appropriate dilutions it is advisable to perform a pilot experiment. One can either make an extensive twofold serial dilution series (for example, 2-1,024 times dilution), or use tenfold pre-dilutions.

It is advised to ensure that the reference gene selected is stable under the conditions of each experiment by performing stability analysis. When the mRNA level of the reference gene is not stable during the experimental procedure, such as during prolonged infection with a virus, we use an external reference gene for normalization. The external reference gene we use is luciferase, which is added as mRNA (commercially available) to the RLT lysis buffer (1 ng/sample) prior to RNA isolation and cell lysis. This guarantees that the external reference RNA and the host RNA are subject to the same treatment prior to cDNA synthesis.4. To calculate the fold change of IBV total RNA, C t deviation is calculated versus a fixed C t value (e.g., C t = 30), because no IBV is present in the non-infected cells that are used as control in all the experiments.5. Interferon containing samples can be stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight.Storage at \u221220 \u00b0C ensures long time (>months) stability. One freeze-thaw cycle can reduce the IFN-activity of a sample by 40 %. To avoid repeated freeze-thawing of samples, avoid measuring the same sample twice. To achieve this, ensure that at least one of the dilutions of the samples falls within the linear range of the standard curve.",
