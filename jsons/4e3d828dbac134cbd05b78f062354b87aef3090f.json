However, unlike in the past, this is a public health emergency that is developing in a globalized and interconnected world like never before. The infectious disease is developing and spreading in an economic and socio-cultural context characterized by populations that tend to aggregate in highly urbanized and overcrowded contexts and by extreme ease of movement, including intercontinental travel (5, 6) . The way in which the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading must also be considered, it has rightly been compared to a real \"tsunami\" wave (7) . In fact, the epidemic is expressed by the tremendous number of infections in an extremely short period of time, thus affecting large portions of the population, which leads to the concentration of a disproportionate number of requests for assistance compared to the emergency response capacity of the health systems.",

This can also be observed in China, where, in the face of an internal growth of new cases equal to zero over the past few days, new infections have been recorded due to the presence of the so-called \"reentry cases.\" It must also be taken into account that the epidemic spread will occur with peaks at different times and areas, within and between the various countries, so the overall consequences will be related to the effectiveness of the different health systems.",

Suspension of caregiver visits to hospitalized patients (underwear, clothes, and necessities will be delivered to hospital staff at the entrance of the building, thus avoiding the need to enter). Exceptional cases must be authorized by clinicians according to the rules of the health management; access in derogation will be managed by the staff in order to avoid any contact and for a limited time. 2. Rehabilitation units will have to keep the doors closed in order to control and direct the flow (if possible all the entrances should be recorded, indicating the time). for all health personnel and visitors with permission, monitoring of body temperature <37.5 \u2022 C (if higher, do not allow access and give indication of home isolation) 3. For discharges (see rules for access in derogation and compliance with point 2) 4. Suspension of all meeting activities, replaced by the use of telephone or email contact. 5. Clinical interviews with family members by phone or email only. 6. Remodeling of rehabilitation programs, identifying the most relevant goals, among the short-term achievable ones 7. Suspension of all rehabilitation activities that require internal flow (movement between floors or to reach gyms) 8. Carrying out of rehabilitation activities in the patients' room where possible; in the case of gym activities, strictly keep the distance of at least 2 m between the patients. 9. Reduction of the rehabilitation team's activities (keep only those which are strictly necessary, which will be carried out by the clinician together with the coordinator, after collecting updates from the other staff) 10. Education and empowerment of all healthcare professionals involved in rehabilitation team, by means of specific targeted training (e.g., about the correct use of PPE) 11. For all healthcare professionals, it is recommended to \"enhance hand hygiene by following the WHO instructions, before and after each patient and whenever the hands move from the patient to another surface\" (14) 12. Remember that \"Masks with greater protection (FFP2, FFP3) are indicated only in suspicious or full-blown cases, therefore it is suggested not to abuse these devices, so as not to reduce their availability for cases of real need\" 13. In the management of suspicious cases (cases with not deferrable treatment) (15), remember.",
