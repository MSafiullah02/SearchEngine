These and other complications can lead to respiratory failure (RF) [1\u20133], which is treated with invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) protects the airways against aspiration or obstruction, creates positive pressure ventilation, and provides optimal airway control, allowing diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. However, IMV exposes patients to important complications, due to causes such as the trauma caused by intubation and the presence of the endotracheal prosthesis, and the reduction of the natural defense mechanisms of the respiratory system, which may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia [1, 4] These complications associated with IMV increase the chance of extubation failure, which increase the mortality rate and increase hospital stay duration [4, 5].",

As in the adult environment, the use of NIV in neonatology and pediatrics has been gaining acceptance [6, 8\u201310]. However, despite growing interest, few studies have been conducted on this topic. The indication of NIV for pediatrics in different clinical settings is controversial. Existing studies were either performed in single centers or with a small number of patients, or without taking into account the parameters used for mechanical ventilation (ventilatory variables), which are highly relevant for identifying factors prognostic of success or failure. Conventionally, acute RF in postoperative cardiac surgery children is treated with orotracheal reintubation and invasive ventilatory support [6\u20139, 11]. The use of NIV in this population as an alternative ventilatory support is not well established, in contrast to studies in adults where its use is already consolidated [9, 10].",

The present study points to the use of lower pressure gradient values as a predictive factor for the successful use of NIV.",

In contrast, in our study, which had a larger number of participants (170 vs. 29), the median NIV durations were very similar between the success and failure groups (p = 0.804). However, the NIV durations were also much lower than those presented in the aforementioned article (48 h and 46 h for failure and success groups, respectively), despite similar success rates. This leads us to believe that if, after about 50 h on NIV, the patient has not shown signs of improvement, reintubation should be considered.",

Other critical actions include watching for the presence of pulmonary secretions, to rapidly eliminate them; monitoring the level of awareness of the child and trying to calm the child or administer sedation in case of agitation or, in cases of lethargy, re-evaluating the therapy; and making the appropriate choices of interface and supply fan.

Recently, some authors, such as Hernandez [22], in a study comparing the use of HFNC with NIV after extubation in patients at high risk of extubation failure, showed that NIV was not superior to HFNC in preventing reintubation. However, the definition of high risk of failure in that study was quite broad. Despite the promising results of the HFNC, this therapy costs more than NIV, which can be performed with the same ventilators that are already present in intensive care units. In developing countries, this cost factor is critical in choosing the therapeutic method to be used.",
