They also contain an oligosaccharide moiety and are classified according to this carbohydrate structure (ganglio, isoganglio, lacto etc.).5,19 Gangliosides are a peculiar and particularly important subclass of glycosphingolipids, because they contain negatively charged sialic acids (N-acetylneuraminic acid or N-glycolylneuraminic acid) linked to the lipooligosaccharide moiety. Gangliosides are named and classified according to the number of sialic acid residues attached (M for one, D for two, T for 3 and Q for 4) to the inner sugar moiety and according to their chromatographic mobility (Fig. 1b).20 The somewhat illogical numbering of the gangliosides (5\u2212x) is based on the number (x) of the inner sugar moieties (glucose, galactose or GalNAc) according to the original experimental classification of Svennerholm.21 Thus, if x is 4, the gangliosides are: GM1, GD1, GT1, x = 3 for GM2, GD2, GT2, and x = 2 for GM3, GD3, and GT3 (Fig. 1b).",

They also take part in the development and regeneration of neurons.25,26 During brain development, ganglioside expression undergoes massive qualitative and quantitative changes.27 The ganglioside expression profile changes so that in embryonic rodent and human brain the predominant gangliosides are simple gangliosides like GM3 and GD3, while in adults more complex species such as GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b predominate28 and comprise over the 90% of the adult brain gangliosides.20,29,30 This difference in ganglioside expression reflects changes in the expression of various glycosyltransferases, i.e., the enzymes needed for the synthesis of gangliosides.20,31 Vajn et al.29 have used immunochemical techniques to localize the presence of the above-mentioned gangliosides in the brains of C57bl/6 mice (Table 1).",

Lipid rafts are specific and transient subdomains rich in glycosphingolipids (e.g., gangliosides), cholesterol and distinct proteins, e.g., caveolins, flotillins and glycophosphoinositol (GPI)-linked proteins. They also contain molecules involved in signaling, like low molecular weight and hetero-trimeric G proteins, EGF receptors, PDGF receptors, endothelin receptors, MAP kinase and protein kinase C.34 Gangliosides interact with phospholipids, cholesterol and transmembrane proteins of the lipid rafts both in cis and trans. They are involved in many cellular processes such as regulation of many cellular functions, neurotransmission, interaction with regulatory proteins of the nervous system and in cell-cell recognition, proliferation, as well as in the modulation of signal transduction pathways.10",

Because of their location on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, gangliosides are critical components in the protection of host structures against the autologous immune system. By virtue of their robust negative charges, sialic acids shield self-surfaces and repulse the attachment of other cells or macromolecules to the cellular surfaces. On the other hand, certain viruses, bacteria and parasites, like blood merozoites of the deadliest malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, have learnt to exploit sialic acids/gangliosides as their receptors. Thus, gangliosides can function as attachment sites for pathogens. Some bacterial toxins (cholera toxin, Salmonella typhi toxin) also use sialic acids as their receptors. Since the binding of these toxins is specific for sialic acids in humans, the diseases they cause also occur primarily in humans.",

Influenza viruses bind to sialic acids via their hemagglutinin (H) proteins, and after entry e.g., to respiratory epithelial cells, the neuraminidase (N) enzymes of the virus, will cut the sialic acids from the cell surface to prevent entry of further viruses to the cell. Of great importance, different types of influenza viruses carry H proteins with different sialic acid specificities. Thus, only certain influenza viruses (H1, H2, H3) are infecting humans, while H1 and H3 have more preference for pigs and all types from H1 to H16 can infect birds. The H5 and H7 types are particularly dangerous influenza virus types for birds and a potential risk for humans, as well.35 Variation in the H and N protein structures in pandemic influenza strains forces the adoption of new vaccines against the H and N proteins for seasonally occurring new types of influenza virus during epidemics.",

In general, sialic acids are not very immunogenic, although in some cases and with specific sialic acids immunization may occur and cause immune damage (see below). Gangliosides function in the recognition and protection of host organs and tissues from complement attack by binding the complement regulatory protein factor H.36 The complement system has a potentially strong cytotoxic and inflammation-inducing activity. Sialic acids provide a robust protection against complement killing of autologous cells. This is mediated by the binding of the soluble complement inhibitor factor H to the surface sialic acids, when the surfaces are threatened by C3b deposition.37",

            "text": "A set of mammalian proteins, more than 150, are anchored to the outer leaflets of cell membranes via a GPI-lipid anchor, which is a standard means of membrane protein anchoring in protozoan parasites. GPI-anchored proteins are enriched in lipid rafts and they can signal via cell membrane tyrosine kinases.41. In humans, GPI-anchored proteins include two complement-regulatory proteins: CD55 (decay accelerating factor; DAF) inhibiting the C3 convertases42 and CD59 (protectin) that inhibits the membrane attack complex formation by binding to the terminal C5b-8 and C5b-9 complexes.43 Alterations in ganglioside profiles may cause changes in the properties of these protective proteins. A deficiency in the anchoring mechanism causes a hematological disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), where affected blood cells become the target for complement attack. A critical feature of the disease is also an increased tendency for thromboses. Most commonly, the disease is caused by an acquired mutation in the X-chromosomal PIG-A gene, whose product is involved in the GPI-anchor synthesis.44 When cells are attacked by the complement membrane attack complex, they release vesicles enriched in GPI-anchored proteins. Overall, the GPI-lipid anchored proteins together with the attached gangliosides are only relatively loosely bound to cell membranes and can easily become detached. For example, high density lipoproteins in human plasma can transfer GPI-anchored CD59 between cells.45 It is likely that the same applies for gangliosides, as well. Also, Helicobacter pylori, a long living companion in the human gastric ventricular mucosa, may acquire the human CD59 molecules to its surface to help the bacteria to survive attacks by the human complement system.46 Analogously, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria may become transferred to the surfaces of human cells. Transfer of cell membrane glycolipids, including gangliosides and LPS, between human and microbial cells could\u2014via an adjuvant type effect\u2014be involved in the generation of antibody responses against these structures.",

The presence of AGA in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been investigated, but recent studies found no differences between ALS patients and healthy controls.58 AGA were also sporadically identified in cases of myasthenia gravis and Lambert\u2013Eaton syndrome59,60 and in a single case of small fiber neuropathy61.

Pathogens may also carry structural elements on their surfaces, e.g., lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS) which resemble gangliosides. This structural similarity may protect pathogenic bacteria from both innate and adaptive immune defense reactions of the host. On the other hand, in the absence or upon loss of tolerance to these structures, the microbial infections may lead to production of autoantibodies against gangliosides.

However, antibodies alone rarely cause target cell damage. They recruit the complement system, leukocytes and other effector mechanisms into the area of antibody deposition. They mediate inflammation and cell injury, whose extent depends on the types of antibodies (class, subclass, target specificity and affinity), individual patterns or reactivity (including the MHC-type determining the extent of T cell help) and target cell sensitivity to damage. Importantly, sialic acids on gangliosides usually protect cells from complement attack, but this protection may fail, if AGAs neutralize the protective layer on cell surfaces. As pointed out above, the complement inhibitor factor H is a key player in protecting host cells from complement attack, because it binds directly to gangliosides in the context of prior antibody-mediated C3b deposition. Inhibition of factor H binding to neuronal cells predisposes them to complement-mediated cell damage and attack by inflammatory leukocytes.",

In general, epidemiological studies have shown 30\u201335% positivity for C. jejuni in GBS patients as compared to 4.4% in controls.97 The second (2) criterium is to identify antibodies or T cells directed against the target antigen. As previously stated, AGAs were identified in patients with GBS and recognized as the key pathological element in the pathogenesis. Depending on the ganglioside targeted a different manifestation of GBS may occur. Interestingly, also activated T cells and macrophages have been identified around the nerves of GBS patients.88 Apparently, patients develop T cell responses against the exogenous LOS and endogenous glycolipids (gangliosides). Further studies should address the nature of the responding T cells. Possible candidates include innate lymphoid cells, gamma-delta T cells or NK cells. As the third criterium (3) microbial mimics to the target antigens have been identified. They include the low molecular weight LOS of C. jejuni. It has been observed that only certain specific C. jejuni serotypes are associated with GBS, in particular O:19 and O:41.94,98 These serotypes correspond to the development of AGAs especially against GM1 but also to other gangliosides, like GD1a and GD3. As the final criterium (4) it has been shown that GBS can be induced in a rabbit model by an injection with either the GM1 ganglioside or the homologous LOS of C. jejuni.99 The antibodies were found to disrupt lipid rafts, nodal structures and ion channel clusters in the peripheral motor nerves.99 Interestingly, in the animal model the neuronal damage could be inhibited with the synthetic serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesilate that also acts as a complement inhibitor.100",

It has been associated with neurological sequelae such as microcephaly in newborns and GBS in adults.115,116 Microcephaly seems to be related to a direct neurotropic effect of the virus on the neural cells of the newborn, given its ability to cross the placenta, while the pathogenesis of GBS is far from being understood.115,117 An autoimmune etiology, through a mechanism of molecular mimicry similar to the one observed in C. jejuni, has been hypothesized, but the mechanism may differ.118 In a few studies, AGAs have been found in GBS patients having antibodies against ZIKV. Nico et al. reported anti-GD3 antibodies in acute ZIKV infections.119 Baskar and colleagues showed anti-GM1 antibodies in 50% of ZIKV-positive patients.120 However, Cao-Lormeau and his team showed that only a fraction of patients with GBS after ZIKV had AGAs, and their sera (anti-GA1 and GD1a) displayed no antibody competition between ZIKV proteins and GA1, a.k.a. asialo GM1.116 In addition to ZIKV, also other arbovirus infections have been associated with GBS, like dengue, West Nile and chikungunya with sporadic reports in the literature. Case reports have been published on GBS in patients with hepatitis E121 or herpes simplex virus infection.122 Parvovirus B19 infections are associated with a broad spectrum of neurological complications. Anti-GD1b AGAs were described in a case report by Sequeira et al. in a 23-year-old immunocompetent woman with a PB19 infection associated with hemolytic anemia and cranial polyneuropathy.123",

In the Miller-Fisher variant of GBS, characterized by ataxia, areflexia and ophtalmoplegia, high titer AGAs against GQ1b are present in the majority of patients in the acute phase. These AGAs cross-react often with GT1a, and may react with GD3 and GD1b gangliosides, as well. They activate the human complement system and mediate complement-dependent injury in the motor nerve terminal.124,125 Complement activation will also attract leukocytes to neurons and contribute to activation of neutrophils and macrophages. Often, also T lymphocytes have been detected in the area of damage indicating a cell-mediated immune response. The activated immune cells can release cytokines and oxygen radicals to further damage the target cells. As a result, the protective myelin sheath and even the neuronal axons may become destroyed.",

The vaccination increased the risk of developing narcolepsy 6.5\u201314.4-fold in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated ones.136\u2013138 An increase in narcolepsy was not restricted to the flu vaccine.

Furthermore, the other main protein on the virus particle surface is neuraminidase N1, capable of cleaving sialic acids. A molecular mimicry between orexin and the viral proteins leading to T cell cross-reactivity has been suggested.140 Pandemrix is an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine that contains \u03b1-tocopherol, which in vitro can increase the expression of orexin, upregulating the Nrf2 pathway.141 In this way it can potentially favor cross-reactive antigen presentation by MHC class II.142 Another influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, Arepanrix (also by GSK) with a similar composition, same adjuvant and antigenicity as Pandemrix,143 did not show any increase in narcolepsy incidence.144 This could have been due to a different protein antigen composition in the vaccine.145",

The origin of these antibodies could be an immune response against the vaccine adjuvant (squalene) preparation that is from shark liver, a source rich in the GM3 and GM4 gangliosides. The role of anti-ganglioside antibodies in the pathological process is not clear. While the disease most likely is a specific autoimmune response to distinct self antigen(s) expressed by the orexin producing neurons the anti-ganglioside antibodies could have an additional role. A model for the potential disease development is depicted in Fig. 2. Anti-GM3 or anti-GM4 antibodies could (1) directly damage the hypothalamic neurons by binding to their gangliosides and activating the complement system or inflammatory cells. This is unlikely to be a major mechanism given the presence of these autoantibodies only in a proportion of the patients. On the other hand, they are frequently observed in the context of neurological disorders and could have an effect on the aforesaid nervous damage. (2) Since GM3 is a major endothelial ganglioside, anti-GM3 AGAs could damage the cerebral endothelium and BBB increasing its permeability to immune cells and mediators. (3) Furthermore, anti-GM3 autoantibodies could bind to lipid raft gangliosides and activate a signaling pathway that leads to the recruitment of molecules like integrins that can potentially facilitate the chemotaxis of the leukocytes.146 A similar effect has been observed in melanoma cell lines, in which GD3 activation leads to the recruitment of \u03b21 integrins.147 These potential mechanisms could play a role in any disease, where antiganglioside antibodies are formed (Table 2).",

Following the uptake of and response to vaccine components (e.g., H1 and N1 proteins, squalene, \u03b1-tocopherol, possible nucleoprotein or ganglioside impurities) the APCs migrate to the lymph node presenting the antigens to the T-cells through the MHC class II, inducing their activation. Eventually, through a process of molecular mimicry this mechanism could lead to a targeted attack against hypothalamic orexinergic neurons and to the subsequent narcolepsy onset. Antiganglioside antibodies could emerge upon complex formation between H1N1 proteins and the gangliosides, which would be picked up by the ganglioside responding B cells. T cells specific for the H1N1 proteins would provide the necessary help for antibody formation by B cells, and subsequently by plasma cells.
