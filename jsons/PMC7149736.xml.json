In many cases the history will be given by someone other than the patient, but the physician should still ask even young children directly about their complaints. When asking about the history of the present illness, the physician should encourage a clear and chronologic narrative account. Questions should be open ended, and at intervals the physician should give a verbal summary to confirm and clarify the information.

The onset of disease may have been gradual (e.g., with some interstitial lung diseases) or sudden (e.g., with foreign body aspiration). The physician should ask about initial manifestations and who noticed them first. The age at first presentation is important because respiratory diseases that manifest soon after birth are more likely to have been inherited or to be related to congenital malformations. Depending on the duration of symptoms, the illness will be classified as acute, subacute, chronic, or recurrent. These definitions are arbitrary, but a disease of less than 3 weeks duration is generally called acute, between 3 weeks and 3 months subacute, and longer than 3 months chronic. If symptoms are clearly discontinuous, with documented intervals of well-being, the disease is recurrent. This distinction is important because many parents may perceive their child as being chronically ill, not realizing that young normal children may have six to eight respiratory infections per year, particularly during the first 2 years if the child is in a daycare setting or if they have older siblings.",

Similarly, a wood-burning stove used for indoor heating may be a contributing factor. The physician should therefore obtain a detailed description of the patient's home environment. Are there household pets, such as dogs, cats, and hamsters, or birds, such as budgies, pigeons, or parrots? What are the plants in and around the house?

The duration of pregnancy, possible multiple births, and circumstances leading to the onset of labor should be noted. Difficult labor and delivery may cause respiratory problems at birth (e.g., asphyxia and meconium aspiration), and the physician should ask about birth weight and Apgar scores. The neonatal course has to be reviewed carefully because many events during this period may have an impact on the patient's respiratory status in later years. Were there any signs of neonatal respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, retractions, and cyanosis? Treatment with oxygen or endotracheal intubation should be recorded. Some extrathoracic disorders provide valuable clues for diagnosis, such as the presence of eczema in atopic infants or neonatal conjunctivitis in a young patient with chlamydia pneumonia, particularly if there was a documented infection of the mother.",

The physician should ask whether the child was fed by breast or bottle. For the newborn and young infant, feeding is a substantial physical exercise and may, in the presence of respiratory disease, lead to distress, much as climbing stairs does in the older patient. The question of exercise tolerance in an infant is therefore asked by inquiring how long it takes the patient to finish a meal. The caloric intake of infants with respiratory disease is often reduced despite an increased caloric need, to support the work of breathing. This reduced caloric intake commonly results in a failure to thrive. Older patients with chronic respiratory disease and productive cough may suffer from a continuous exposure of their taste buds to mucopurulent secretions and may quite understandably lose their appetites, but medical treatment (e.g., with certain antibiotics) may have similar effects. Patients with food hypersensitivity may react with bronchospasm or even with interstitial lung disease on exposure to the allergen (e.g., to milk). Physical irritation and inflammation occur if food is aspirated into the respiratory tract. This happens frequently in patients with debilitating neurologic diseases and deficient protective reflexes of the upper airways but may also occur in neurologically intact children.",

It is impossible to judge current complaints or responses to medical interventions without an individual frame of reference for each patient. The physician should encourage the child and the parents to describe a typical day at home, daycare, kindergarten, or school. This will provide valuable information about the impact of the illness on daily routines, the financial implications, the existing or absent social support structures, and the coping strategies of the family. Compliance with medical treatment is rarely better than 50%, and physicians are generally unable to predict how well their patients follow and adhere to therapeutic regimens. Compliance can improve if the patient and the parents gain a better understanding of the disease and its treatment. It is important to recognize prior experiences that the family may have had with the health care system and to understand individual religious and health beliefs. Particularly in children with chronic respiratory ailments whose symptoms are not being controlled or prevented, the effort and unpleasantness (e.g., of chest physiotherapy) may limit the use of such interventions. The physician should also consider the social stigma associated with visible therapy, especially among peers of the adolescent patient.",

The respiratory manifestations of coughing, noisy breathing, wheezing, and cyanosis are discussed in detail at the end of this chapter. Cardiovascular findings may include palpitations and dysrhythmia in hypoxic patients; there may be edema formation and peripheral swelling with cor pulmonale. Effects of respiratory disease on the gastrointestinal tract may appear with cough-induced vomiting and abdominal pain. There may be a direct involvement with diarrhea, cramps, and fatty stools in patients with cystic fibrosis. The physician should ask about hematuria and about skin manifestations, such as eczema or rashes, and about swellings and pain of lymph nodes or joints.

First, the pattern of breathing should be observed. This includes the respiratory rate, rhythm, and effort. The respiratory rate decreases with age and shows its greatest variability in newborns and young infants (Fig. 6-1\n). The rate should be counted over at least 1 minute, ideally several times for the calculation of average values. Because respiratory rates differ among sleep states and become even more variable during wakefulness, a note should be made describing the behavioral state of the patient.

Other causes of tachypnea are fever (approximately five to seven breaths per minute increase per degree above 37\u00b0C), anemia, exertion, intoxication (salicylates), and anxiety and psychogenic hyperventilation. The opposite, an abnormally slow respiratory rate or bradypnea, can occur in patients with metabolic alkalosis or central nervous system depression. The terms hyperpnea and hypopnea refer to abnormally deep or shallow respirations.

If no other signs of respiratory distress are present in an infant with head bobbing, however, central nervous system disorders, such as third ventricular cysts, should be considered.

Inspiratory indrawing of the lateral chest is known as Hoover's sign and can be observed in patients with obstructive airway disease.

Divergence of the thumbs during expansion of the thorax supposedly aids in the visual perception of the range and symmetry of respiratory movements. This technique is of little use in children. A more accurate method of documenting the vectors of movement at different sites (but one that is not yet practical for bedside evaluation) is to place a grid of optical markers on the chest surface and film their positional changes during respiration relative to a steady reference frame. A similar concept is used in optical studies of chest deformities. Projection of raster lines onto the anterior chest surface allows stereographic measurement of deformities, such as pectus excavatum, and augments the visual image of the surface shape (Fig. 6-2\n). In practice and without such tools, however, the physician should inspect the chest at different angles of illumination to enhance the visual perception of chest wall deformities.

There is a very close relationship between airflow and tracheal sound intensity, particularly at high frequencies. In the presence of local narrowing (e.g., in children with subglottic stenosis), flow velocity at the stenotic site is increased, and so is the tracheal sound intensity.

At lower frequencies, other mechanisms that are not directly related to air flow (e.g., muscle noise and thoracic cavity resonances) have prominent effects on lung sounds and gas density effects are less obvious. Inspiratory lung sounds show little contribution of noise generated at the glottis. Their origin is likely more peripheral (i.e., in the main and segmental bronchi).

This information cannot be gathered on subjective auscultation but requires objective acoustic measurements. A trained ear, however, will recognize many of the findings that are related to these mechanisms. For example, lung sounds in healthy children and adults are not necessarily equal at corresponding sites over both lungs. In fact, expiratory sounds are typically louder at the right upper lobe compared with the left side. Similar asymmetry has been recognized when sound is introduced at the mouth and measured at the chest surface. A likely explanation for this asymmetry is the effect on sound propagation by the cardiovascular and mediastinal structures to the left of the trachea. Asymmetry of lung sounds is also noticeable in most healthy subjects during inspiration when one listens over the posterior lower chest. The left side tends to be louder here, probably because of the size and spatial orientation of the larger airways due to the heart.",

On auscultation, one hears many different tones simultaneously, which is called polyphonic wheezing. Obstruction of a single airway can produce a single monophonic wheeze or, in the obstruction of extrathoracic airways, stridor. Both inspiratory and expiratory wheezes are present in the majority of asthmatic patients. The audible expiratory phase (expirium) is typically prolonged because of wheezing. Objectively measured expiratory time (expiration), however, is rarely prolonged except in very severe airway obstruction. Under these circumstances, airflow is minimal, and thus wheezing is absent. Respiration becomes ominously silent, and the patient may have carbon dioxide retention and cyanosis. In less severe cases, however, the proportion of inspiration and expiration occupied by wheezing correlates to some extent with the degree of airflow obstruction. Objective and reproducible wheeze quantification can be achieved by computer-assisted techniques, but in practice the quantification of wheezing severity is made by subjective assessment at the bedside.BOX 6-2Causes of Wheezing and Stridor Other than AsthmaMalformationCardiovascular anomalies (e.g., vascular ring)Airway anomalies (e.g., web, cyst, hemangioma, malacia, stenosis)Esophageal anomalies (e.g., enteric cyst)InflammationTracheitisBronchitisBronchiolitisBronchiectasisCystic fibrosisCompressionExtrinsicEsophageal foreign bodyLymphadenopathyMalignancyIntrinsicEndobronchial foreign bodyTumor (rare)Extrathoracic DiseaseLaryngitisEpiglottitisVocal cord paralysisRetropharyngeal abscessPeritonsillar abscessLaryngomalaciaPolyps, adenoidsOtherMetabolic disturbances (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypokalemia)Psychosomatic illness (e.g., emotional laryngeal wheezing, factitious asthma)",

To minimize the variability of this finding, cyanosis is best observed under daylight and with the patient resting in a comfortably warm room. The distribution of cyanosis and the state of peripheral perfusion should be noted. Patients with decreased cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion can be cyanotic despite normal arterial hemoglobin saturation. Some patients may become cyanotic only during exercise, a not uncommon response when restrictive lung disease reduces the pulmonary capillary bed and the transit time of erythrocytes becomes too short for full saturation during episodes of increased cardiac output. Congenital heart disease in infants may lead to differential cyanosis, which affects only the lower part of the body (e.g., in patients with preductal coarctation of the aorta). Less commonly, only the upper part of the body is cyanotic, for example, in patients with transposition of the great arteries, patent ductus arteriosus, or pulmonary hypertension.",

The blood of newborn infants, conversely, can be well saturated and not cyanotic at lower arterial oxygen tensions because of the different oxygen-binding curve of fetal hemoglobin. In the patient with hypoxemia who does not present with cyanosis (e.g, the anemic patient), the physician has to pay particular attention to other clinical signs and symptoms of hypoxia. These include tachypnea and tachycardia, exertional dyspnea, hypertension, headache, and behavioral changes. With more severe hypoxia there may be visual disturbance, somnolence, hypotension, and ultimately coma. In addition, the patient may have an elevated level of carbon dioxide. Depending on how rapidly and to what extent the level of carbon dioxide has risen, the clinical signs of hypercarbia will largely reflect vascular dilatation.

In addition to clubbing, these patients may have periosteal thickening; symmetric arthritis of ankles, knees, wrists, and elbows; neurovascular changes of hands and feet; and increased thickness of subcutaneous soft tissues in the distal portions of arms and legs. The primary idiopathic or hereditary form of HOA\u2014pachydermoperiostosis\u2014appears with prominent furrowing of the forehead and scalp.

Interestingly, even long-standing finger clubbing seems to resolve in patients after successful heart and lung transplantation. In patients with cystic fibrosis, progression of finger clubbing suggests a suboptimal control of chest infections. It is therefore useful to quantify the degree of digital clubbing.

The progression of chronic cor pulmonale to ultimate right ventricular failure is accompanied by certain physical signs. Initially, the right ventricular systolic pressure and muscle mass increase as pulmonary artery pressure rises. During this stage, cardiac auscultation may be normal or may reveal an increased pulmonary component of the second heart sound, caused by an increase in diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure. The physician should look for a parasternal right ventricular heave. As pulmonary hypertension progresses, there is an increase in right ventricular end-diastolic volume. Dilation of the main pulmonary artery and right ventricular outflow tract lead to systolic pulmonary ejection clicks and murmurs. Diastolic murmurs appear when pulmonary or tricuspid valves or both become insufficient. Third and fourth heart sounds at the left lower sternal border are signs of decreased right ventricular compliance. Most of these right-sided cardiovascular findings are accentuated during inspiration, which augments venous return. Finally, cardiac output falls while end-diastolic pressure and volume increase further in the failing right ventricle.",

            "text": "During quiet spontaneous respiration there is a phasic variation of arterial blood pressure. The widening of this normal respiratory variation is known as pulsus paradoxus. Increased respiratory resistance may exaggerate the normal inspiratory-expiratory difference in left ventricular stroke volume. This is mediated by effects of intrathoracic pressures on ventricular preload. Clinically, pulsus paradoxus is first assessed by palpation of the radial pulse and then is measured at the brachial artery with a sphygmomanometer as the difference in systolic pressure between inspiration and expiration. The pressure cuff is deflated from above systolic level, and the highest pressure during expiration at which systolic pulse sounds are heard is recorded. Similarly, the highest pressure at which every pulse is just audible throughout inspiration is also noted. In general, a drop of greater than 10 mm Hg during inspiration is taken as clinically significant but only a severe paradox of greater than 24 mm Hg is a reliable indicator of severe asthma. The poor correlation between pulsus paradoxus and objective measurements of airflow obstruction may be explained by other factors that affect pleural pressure swings (e.g., the degree of pulmonary hyperinflation and the airflow rate). Furthermore, the accurate measurement of pulsus paradoxus is a challenge in tachypneic, tachycardic, and uncooperative young children. A work group on behalf of the British Thoracic Society Standards of Care Committee found pulsus paradoxus to be absent in one third of patients with the severest obstruction. In contrast to North American practice guidelines, it was therefore recommended that pulsus paradoxus be abandoned as an indicator of severity of asthma attack. In children, wheeze seems to be the clinical parameter of respiratory severity scores that correlates best with pulsus paradoxus, most likely because wheeze requires critical intrathoracic pressures. Perhaps the application of new plethysmographic methods using pulse oximeters will improve the diagnostic value of this clinical sign.",

The sternal (B) and midclavicular (C) lines over the front and the scapular (D) and paravertebral (E) lines over the back provide longitudinal landmarks of the thorax. From a lateral view, the midaxillary line is used for orientation. Horizontal reference points are the supra- and infraclavicular fossae, Ludwig's angle (junction of the second rib at the sternum), the mammillae (normally at the fourth rib), and the epigastric angle. Posteriorly, the prominent spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the supra- and infraspinous fossae of the scapulae provide markers for orientation.",
