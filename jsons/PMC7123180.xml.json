Evidence is accumulating that esterified Sia are more ubiquitous than Neu5Gc. In contrast to Neu5Gc, they also occur in microorganisms. Figure 28.1 shows the Sia family. One Sia molecule may carry one or several, up to three, O-acetyl groups. N-Acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) is most common. Acetyl ester groups are often a combined neuraminic acid with other residues such as N-glycolyl, O-lactyl, or O-methyl groups, and they may also be linked to 2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid (KDN) [1, 2].\n",

            "text": "When studying the roles of O-acetylated Sia, exact analysis of their nature in biological materials is indispensable. The fundaments of these topics were described in this book\u2019s previous edition and elsewhere [2\u201314]. Here, only recent developments or considerations relevant to the following will be presented. Acquiring a better understanding of O-acetylated Sia was hampered since the ester groups are labile and easily hydrolyzed, in particular under acidic or alkaline conditions, possibly during isolation of glycoconjugates or by liberation of Sia from their glycosidic linkages. In addition, esterases, de-O-acetylating Sia, are abundant in tissues [15] and may also reduce the quantity of these Sia in biological materials when released during the tissue extraction process. In spite of these problems, the nature of Sia and the position and number of O-acetyl groups can best be identified in a free state after their liberation from glycosidic linkage and possibly by purification through ion-exchange chromatography. Hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds is carried out by sialidase or mild acids. The latter method has the advantage that all Sia linkages are opened at similar rates, in contrast to enzymatic hydrolysis. The use of propionic acid (2 M, 4 h, 80\u00b0C) gives an excellent yield of O-acetylated Sia without significant isomerization of the ester groups. During concentration of the hydrolyzate, propionic acid evaporates azeotropically, i.e., without concentration, which preserves ester groups; this is in contrast to the hydrochloric or sulfuric acid used earlier, which can damage the Sia.",

Recently, it could be shown [16] that ion-exchange purification on strong alkaline resin, as carried out routinely for a long time [14], leads to isomerization of Neu5,7Ac2 to Neu5,9Ac2. Analysis of such a crude Sia sample is also possible by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the fluorescence-labeled Sia [14, 16]. The accuracy of the assay can be increased by de-esterification with mild alkali or influenza C virus esterase and sialate\u2013pyruvate lyase treatment of the sample. Mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses of free and glycosidically linked O-acetylated Sia are described in [2, 14, 16].",

The SOAT from bovine \u00adsubmandibular gland was solubilized from its subcellular membrane location [32] by detergents and partially purified [4]. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 150\u2013160 kDa, requires an (unknown) activator for full activity, and shows optimum activity at pH 6.5. CMP-Neu5Ac revealed to be the best substrate. It primarily incorporates the O-acetyl group at C-7 of Neu5Ac and can thus be defined as acetyl-CoA:sialate-7-O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.45). Before, it was not clear whether it could also esterify the hydroxyl residue at C-9. 9-O-Acetylated Sia exist in high amounts in BSM beside the 7-O-acetylated Sia and always coexist with Neu5,7Ac2 in other cells and tissues where Sia O-acetylation takes place at the side chain. This may be the result of one of two hypotheses: either 9-O-acetyltransferase activity is present additionally in these biological sources, or isomerization of Neu5,7Ac2 to Neu5,9Ac2 occurs. We favor the second hypothesis since it was shown that the O-acetyl group can migrate spontaneously to C-9, yielding Neu5,9Ac2 [33]. The frequent occurrence of small amounts of Neu5,8Ac2 may be another product of this isomerization process. Since the migration speed is relatively slow at physiological pH, the existence of an isomerase (migrase) is still under discussion; however, firm evidence is lacking [4]. After the arrival of the acetyl at C-9, another acetylation at C-7 is possible, and after migration of this group to O-8, a third acetyl group may be attached to C-7, leading to a fully esterified side chain of Sia. Such Neu5,7,8,9Ac4 was detected in small quantities in BSM, which have high O-acetylation potential. Furthermore, Neu5Ac is primarily O-acetylated at C-7 in starfish gonads (unpublished data) and in normal human lymphocytes (unpublished data) as well as in lymphoblasts of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [25]. The ganglioside GD3 was the best substrate in these experiments. The exact identification of the SOAT specificity was possible by using improved analytical tools, i.e., direct thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or HPLC analysis of the enzyme reaction products by which O-acetyl migration is avoided [23].\n\n",

The reason for this hydrolytic resistance of 7-O-acetyl may be found in the three-dimensional structure of the O-acetylated glycans, as demonstrated by computer-aided modeling (Fig. 28.4). The statistically most frequent position of the 7-O-acetyl group is adjacent to the terminal Sia, while the 9-O-acetyl group is protruding. Correspondingly, the 7-O-acetyl group cannot bind to the catalytic center of the esterases, which is in contrast to the protruding 9-O-acetyl residue. Before hydrolysis, the 7-O-acetyl group has to migrate to C-9. In horse liver, two esterases were found that can hydrolyze only 4-O-acetyl esters and both 4- and 9-acetyls, respectively [15].\n",

While in the case of oxidation of free Neu5Ac with H2O2, a loss of the carboxylic group and the formation of an octonic acid derivative were reported [59], the site of oxidation of mucin-bound Sia is unknown [60]. Tanaka et al. [61] reported desialylation of human low-density lipoproteins by radical reactions, although the mechanism was not explained. Since O-acetylation at C-9 strongly hinders oxidation with mild periodate concentrations of the Sia side chain when compared with the unsubstituted monosaccharide in vitro [18], O-acetylation of this part of the Sia molecule may hinder premature destruction of the cell-protecting Sia layer by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo and thus the development of atherosclerosis. Sia lining the lumen of blood vessels were shown by histological means to be O-acetylated in rats [17, 37, 62] and thus support this assumption. The O-acetyl groups on endothelial cells could also influence receptor interactions. An unusually high concentration of Sia was observed on the surface of vascular endothelia of human, rabbit, and guinea pig, which was decided to be required for the repulsion of blood components [63]. On the other hand, unsubstituted or 4- or 7-O-acetylated Sia may serve as a scavenger of ROS.",

Since it became obvious that carbohydrate-specific monoclonal antibodies are not only useful for basic cell biological research but also for clinical use, some of them have been integrated into the cluster of differentiation (CD) system of monoclonal antibodies detecting cell surface molecules of leukocytes and cells involved in immune reactions [66]. Most of these CD antibody-defined carbohydrates can be subsumed under the term \u201chisto-blood group antigens.\u201d Monoclonal antibodies that are able to distinguish between GD3 and its 7- and 9-O-acetylated variants have been designated as CD60a (GD3), CD60b (9-O-acetyl GD3), and CD60c (7-O-acetyl-GD3) [67].

            "text": "In this section, we focus on the expression and functional impact of O-acetylated carbohydrates on leukocytes and immunity-related cells. Although O-acetylation can occur at various sites of the Sia molecule, from our observations, carbons 7 and 9 are prevalent for this modification in leukocytes. In most studies, it was found that the disialoganglioside GD3 is the major carrier of terminal O-acetylated Sia. Interestingly, GD3 itself has been described as a ganglioside involved in several reactions relevant for the immune system. In earlier in vitro studies, it was shown that gangliosides shed by tumors, such as GD3, inhibit activity of natural killer (NK) cells [68, 69]. In particular, it was speculated that the antitumor cytotoxicity of NK cells was blocked, thereby alleviating undisturbed tumor growth. This idea was later followed up when the new family of Sia-binding lectins, the siglecs, was established. Nicoll et al. [70] described that GD3 expressed on target cells can negatively modulate NK cell cytotoxicity by interacting with siglec-7 on NK cells, which has a preference for binding \u03b12,8-linked disialic acids and seems to be one of the inhibitory NK cell receptors. This observation may have provided a straightforward explanation for a possible protective function of strong GD3 expression in melanoma [71]. However, on the other hand, GD3 expressed on melanoma cells can induce another class of cytotoxic cells, the NKT cells [72]. The fine specificity of GD3-reactive NKT cells is mediated by binding to CD1d, a molecule with a structure like the major histocompatibility antigens on T cells, and with a preference for carbohydrate antigens. This new result has to be compared with the in vivo situation of antimelanoma NK and NKT cell-mediated immunity. Possibly the balance between these two types of cytotoxic cells decides on the outcome of effective immune surveillance in patients with melanoma. Another mechanism to explain the immune escape of melanoma cells may be that GD3 seems able to impair dendritic cell differentiation from monocytes and may induce their apoptosis [73]. Thus, dendritic cells as antigen-presenting cells for efficient T-cell cytotoxicity are missing. Moreover, the GD3-related maturating dendritic cells produced large amounts of the inhibitory cytokine interleukin IL-10 [73]. An open question is how O-acetylation of sialoglycans on tumor cells influences these immune responses. Unfortunately, our knowledge of this aspect is rather scant. Recently, Ravindranath et al. [74] found that, in one patient with melanoma, only metastatic lesions expressed the O-acetylated forms of GD2 and GD3, whereas the primary tumor expressed exclusively the non-O-acetylated gangliosides. In a profound study using a microtiter plate assay with influenza C viruses [71], it was shown that primary melanoma from human skin in most cases expresses elevated levels of 9-O-acetylated GD3, at variable degrees. The same was observed in basalioma, where the expression of this antigen was up to 60-fold higher than in surrounding normal skin [75]. In breast carcinomas, the situation looks somehow more complex. In normal ducts and in benign lesions, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans were present in Golgi regions and at the plasma membrane as detected by reaction with a CD60b antibody; while in carcinomas of the breast, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans were distributed in the cytoplasm in a disorderly fashion [76]. Cell surface expression of CD60b structures was only observed in well-differentiated carcinomas, and overall expression decreased with progression of malignancy.",

Here, sialyl Lewisx (CD15s) moieties of MUC1 and MUC2 were found to be differently O-acetylated [21, 77]. In regards to carcinoma, the O-acetylation decreased from the primary colon carcinomas to their liver metastases, as was observed in mammary carcinomas. Similarly, in colon carcinoma, Sia esterification decreases during increase of malignancy [21]. It may be speculated that O-acetylation of sialyl Lewisx is a negative regulator of the metastasis process, considering that sialyl Lewisx is recognized by selectins of vascular endothelial cells. Thus, the question remains as to whether O-acetylated selectin ligands can inhibit the successful extravasation of tumor cells as a prerequisite for invasion of host tissue.",

Whether loss of O-acetylation in malignant colon carcinomas is an advantage for tumor progression, with regard to easier accessibility for bacterial sialidases, is still unclear.

That Sia-O-acetylation plays a protective role in bacterial colonization of the rumen can be delineated from the observation that bovine fetal submandibular gland expresses almost no O-acetylated Sia [79].

It is unclear whether these so-called natural autoantibodies are present without prior antigen contact or whether their frequency is increased after contact with microbial structures [87]. It has long been known that after infection with C. jejuni, antiganglioside autoantibodies occur, which may be mediated by molecular mimicry with ganglioside-like oligosaccharides on bacterial lipopolysaccharides [88].

Agonistic effects of CD60b and -c monoclonal antibodies on lymphocytic proliferation are in favor of involvement in activation processes [90, 93, 95]. An interesting observation was that T and B lymphocytes react to stimulation with CD60b and -c antibodies in a different way. In T lymphocytes, CD60c antibodies alone can stimulate proliferation. In B cells, additional signals such as IL-4 and triggering of the B-cell receptor are required. For stimulation with antibodies against CD60b, additional signals are needed in both lymphocyte classes [93]. This differential behavior may have a basis in different surface distribution of the antigens. While CD60b structures are found in dot-like formations, possibly as components of rafts in T and B cells, CD60c on T cells showed a more homogenous distribution on the cell surface [93]. It is most likely that CD60b is a costimulatory signal for raft-concentrated receptors, while CD60c in T cells acts as a mitogen. However, most types of leukocytes express raft-like cell surface structures that contain varying extents of either CD60b or -c or both O-acetylated glycans. When CD34+ precursor cells are pretreated with 9-O-acetyl-specific influenza C esterase, CD60b-specific staining is diminished as expected; however, that of CD60c increases, possibly due to a better accessibility for the CD60c residues after degradation of the CD60b epitope (Table 28.2). This experiment also points to a close neighboring cell surface localization of both O-acetylated CD60 variants.\n",

            "text": "It has been known for some time that intracellular GD3 is involved in CD95- and ceramide-mediated apoptosis. Upon receptor triggering de novo, increased activity of GD3 synthase by synthesized GD3 accumulates intracellularly. GD3 normally restricted in its presence to the Golgi network and plasma membrane is transferred to mitochondria via endosomal transport [97]. Here, it is found in raft-like mitochondrial membrane domains [98]. The mechanisms of GD3-induced apoptosis can be traced back to a GD3-mediated increase of the production of ROS and a change in the mitochondrial membrane potential [99, 100]. O-Acetylation of GD3 suppresses this proapoptotic function of nonacetylated GD3 and does not have the deleterious effects on mitochondria membranes [101]. Cells that are resistant to overexpression of GD3 convert existing GD3 more readily to 9-O-acetylated GD3 [101]. Also, exogenous O-acetylated GD3 given to cells in vitro is internalized and can prevent apoptosis [102]. It was also observed that an apoptosis-resistant variant of the T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat transferred GD3 into 9-O-acetyl GD3 [102]. Thus, it is most likely that high intracellular expression of 9-O-acetyl GD3 protects tumor cells from apoptosis. While data have been gathered on the antiapoptotic effect of 9-O-acetyl GD3, no data are available on possible effects of 7-O-acetyl GD3. We have observed that in T- and B-cell lines, 7-O-acetyl followed by 9-O-acetyl GD3 is present in an intracellular pool (unpublished data). Given that intracellular 9-O-acetyl GD3 confers antiapoptotic potential, can this protective effect possibly be accelerated by rapid conversion of 7-O-acetyl into 9-O-acetyl GD3? (It was described above that the primary insertion site of O-acetyls catalyzed by mammalian, including lymphocyte, Sia O-acetyltransferases is at C-7, from where it can isomerize to C-9.) We also have no knowledge of the mechanisms for transporting both acetylated forms of GD3 to the cell surface or of those with regard to the balance between the intracellular pool and cell surface expression of CD60b and -c, and what is decisive for regulation of either antiapoptotic or proliferative effects. First experiments showed that human tonsillar B lymphocytes undergoing either spontaneous or staurosporine-induced apoptosis, in vitro, are characterized by expression of CD60b on their surface, but not expression of CD60c [93]. It may be that O-acetylated gangliosides fulfill different tasks at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments.",
