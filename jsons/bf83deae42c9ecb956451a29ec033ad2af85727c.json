While COVID-19 affects all groups, severe pathology and mortality is disproportionately highest in the elderly, underrepresented minorities (blacks/African Americans and Latinos), and/or in those with underlying comorbidities. Obesity and Type II diabetes, two prominent risk factors for severe COVID-19, may underlie the health disparity observed in these populations (Dietz and Santos-Burgoa, 2020; Dharmasena et al., 2016) . The high prevalence of these risk factors, worldwide, but especially in the U.S. and other developed countries, is likely driven by increased consumption of the typical Western diet (WD) consisting of high amounts of saturated fat (HFD), refined carbohydrates and sugar, and low levels of fiber, unsaturated fats, and antioxidants (Cordain et al., 2005) .",

Therefore, consumption of a WD significantly impairs adaptive immunity while ramping up innate immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and severely impairing host defense against viral pathogens.

Data suggest that minorities have increased barriers to access healthy food choices and nutritional education, likely due to increased rates of poverty and decreased access to quality healthcare in the U.S. (Dharmasena et al., 2016) . Thus, the access to healthy, fresh whole foods should be made more readily available to those who cannot normally afford it in order to relieve the chronic disease burden in these communities. Indeed, studies show that consuming healthy foods has a rapid antiinflammatory effect, even in the presence of obesity pathology (Connaughton et al., 2016) . A change in these policies could also have long-term benefits on disease prevention, including COVID-19, by increasing the efficacy of vaccines, given that vaccines have been shown to be less effective in obese individuals (Green and Beck, 2017) .",

In addition to potential long-term lung damage, the possible impacts on neurological function are not insignificant. This is because it is known that peripheral inflammatory events can evoke an exaggerated and persistent neuroinflammatory response in vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, there is a well-known association between pathological levels of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Thus, profound challenges of the immune system like COVID-19 could potentiate the neuroinflammatory response and disease onset in these vulnerable groups. In support of this notion, there have been instances of dementia in the elderly following viral infection, including respiratory viruses such as influenza (Honjo et al., 2009 ).",
