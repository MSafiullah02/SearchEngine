However, the setting is very dynamic with a clear trend to worsening. Today's circumstances do not fit any previous protocol guidance. An overwhelmed health system, with a lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) and ventilatory support, has led to a global sanitary collapse; with a 90% in hospital occupancy of COVID-19 disease alone, one might correctly guess that the response to remaining diseases, including all cardiovascular ones, is underdiagnosis and undertreatment.",

Despite the extensive use of telematic consultation with the aim of identifying patients at risk of clinical worsening (i.e. amputation risk in CLI patients), these \"assessment based protocols\" are far from working in this unusual scenario. People are simply not coming to hospital as they are extremely afraid; in addition, the first line of disease identification (family medicine) is nearly absent, as family doctors have already been distributed to emergency departments to aid in pulmonary care. Thus, a change in current protocol design considering these novel issues should be created.",

This is of extreme importance, 3 as the lack of an unaffected workforce could be avoided with adequate and fast COVID testing, 4 receiving specific disease education and by using PPE (unfortunately not adequate in Spain). Moreover, the health professional (potentially infected and working actively with patients) can maintain the negative circle of contagion for those coming to hospital with other kinds of disease and their coworkers. This may lead to the organisation of specific COVID free surgical teams; however, this surely deserves a more in depth discussion in each centre.",

One might think that an \"endovascular first approach\" is the best solution to deal with this issue. Protocols suggest treating ruptured AAA by endovascular aneurysm repair if anatomically feasible in patients with long life expectancy. The same may be considered for CLI. However, one may consider the global scenario where all has changed: we are not working in the usual operating room (it has been converted into an ICU for COVID-19 patients); we are without our usual nursing staff (they have been distributed according to hospital needs); and room availability is pretty scarce (as our > 800 bed hospital now shares only four or five COVID free surgical rooms for all surgical specialities plus one for identified COVID-19 patients).",
