However, molecular profiles of GBS in many countries outside of these regions was not well documented [1, 2]. GBS causes early-onset neonatal disease (EOD) which is characterized by onset of clinical symptoms during the first week of life (0\u20136 days) following birth; it usually results in vertical transmission from colonized pregnant women to newborns during or just before delivery [3]. The other form of GBS disease appears in infants is the late-onset disease (LOD) - characterized by the onset of symptoms within 7 days to 89 days of age. It can be acquired from the mother or environmental sources [4, 5]. It is also an important cause of preterm delivery, stillbirth, and puerperal sepsis [6, 7].",

            "text": "To colonize and cause diseases, GBS use a collection of virulence factors; one of the most important being a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) [8]. Human GBS has currently 10 serotypes, Ia, Ib, II to IX, based on serotype specific antigens [9] and the current candidate capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccines target only a subset of these [10]. A study described that the five most common serotypes, Ia, Ib, II, III, and V accounted for more than 85% of serotypes in global regions that have reported serotype data, including the Americas (96%), Europe (93%), and the Western Pacific (89%) [11], and Africa (91.8%) [12]. A review demonstrated that among the ten serotypes, Ia, Ib, II, III, and V accounts for 98% of the identified colonizing isolates worldwide. Serotype III, associated with invasive disease, accounts for 25%, but is less frequent in some South American and Asian countries, but serotypes VI\u2013IX are more common in Asia [13]. Another report from Iran showed that serotypes V (19.6%), II (12.5%) and IV (12.5%) were the most frequent followed by serotypes III (10.7%) and VI (10.7%), Ib (8.9%), Ia (7/1%), VII (5/3%) and VIII (5/3%); and 7.1% of strains were non-type-able [14]. A study in Ghana showed as serotypes VII (38.5 to 42.9%) and IX(26.9 to 32.1%) were the most common serotypes [15]. Serotyping of GBS is useful to understand the local epidemiology, for monitoring of serotype replacement or capsular switching, and for contributing existing serotype profiles in the area for rational, effective and broad serotype coverage GBS vaccine development [16, 17]. But, there is scarcity of serotype profile data of GBS colonizing pregnant women and newborns in Northwest Ethiopia for the last three decades.",

            "text": "GBS remained susceptible to the beta-lactam antibiotics, but, resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics used as alternative therapy has been reported [18]. Macrolide resistance in GBS is represented by two mechanisms: Target Site Modification by Erythromycin ribosomal methylase, mediated by ermB, ermA, ermTR, or ermC genes which confers cross resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptograminB (MLSB phenotype) [19]. Erm genes encode methylase 23S rRNA, which is responsible for methylation of erythromycin and clindamycin receptor sites in ribosomes [20]. This resistance can be constitutive macrolide lincosamidestreptograminB (cMLSB) resistance, as well as inducible macrolide lincosamidestreptograminB (iMLSB) resistance [21]. The second resistance mechanism that found in GBS is Macrolide efflux pump, mediated by mef genes, which confers resistance to 14 and 15 member macrolides only. In addition, a novel efflux system distinct from the Mef pump and encoded by mreA (for macrolide resistance efflux) was reported in a unique strain of S. agalactiae COH31 \u03b3/\u03b4 [22]. Susceptible GBS isolates also showed to possess the mreA gene, and it might function as a housekeeping gene [23].",

Macrolide resistance genes were found in a small proportion of the isolates (8%) and each of the three relevant genes was represented as 3.3% ermB, 2.5% ermA, and 2.3% mefA/E. In addition, one isolate contained both ermA and ermB, and one contained both ermA and mefA/E [24]. In another study, macrolide resistance genes were screened and the resistant rate in total isolates was reported as 69.5%. Ribosome methylation genes (ermB, ermA/TR, ermC) were screened in all examined isolates and the most prevalence gene (63.04%) was ermB,and ermA\\TR gene accounted 23.9%, but ermC gene was not detected. Findings of the study displayed that the prevalence rate of efflux pumps encoding genes (mefA and mreA) were 8.69 and 69.5% respectively. The study also showed that 14 (30.4%) of the isolates were not recognized as a carrier of any erythromycin resistance genes. One isolate among the screened isolates was harbored four erythromycin resistance genes except erm C gene [25]. Muller et al. reported that resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was found in 8 and 7%, respectively. Macrolide resistance genes mef(A), erm (TR) and erm(B) were found in one, two, and five isolates, respectively; only 5/8 (62.5%) of the isolates exhibited both genotypic as well as phenotypic resistance. One genotype occurred in 36% of the subset [26].",

Tetracycline resistance was predominantly due to tetM, which was detected alone in the 56.3% of the isolates, or in 37.5% of the isolates in association with tetL. However, there are no genes encoding drug resistance detected for other antibiotics tested. In addition, penicillin binding protein (PBP1A and PBP2X) for beta-lactam antibiotic was not detected in our isolates. Of the surface proteins screened from our isolates, the alpha-like protein (ALPH), serine-rich repeat-1 (SRR1),and Pili, were detected.
