Feline immunodeficiency virus infection of domestic cats is also recognised as an important animal model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine development (Willett et al., 1997). Currently, effective vaccines are not available for the majority of these feline infections, and curative treatment is often not possible. A concerted effort to develop feline-specific reagents has facilitated an improved understanding of the immune mechanisms that determine the disease outcome following exposure to these feline pathogens Beatty et al., 1996, Flynn et al., 1996, Paltrinieri et al., 1998, Flynn et al., 2002. However, progress in this area is slow. Thus, there remains a requirement for the continued development of sensitive, species-specific reagents to quantitatively define the important immune control mechanisms in the cat.",

Furthermore, we have been unable to detect fIFN-\u03b3 using reagents from other species in a number of immunological assays. In this report, we describe the development of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (mAbs and pAbs) specific for fIFN-\u03b3. Using these highly sensitive reagents in flow cytometry, intracellular fIFN-\u03b3 produced by feline mononuclear cells in response to mitogenic and virus-specific antigenic stimulation could be detected and fIFN-\u03b3-secreting cells could be directly quantified ex vivo. These reagents have clear applications in assessing the efficacy of novel prophylactic and immunotherapeutic approaches to the control of feline infectious disease.",

The wells of 96-well U-bottom culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware Europe, Le Pont de Claix, France) were seeded with 1\u00d7105 cells in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 10 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine and 5\u00d710\u22125 M 2-mercaptoethanol (complete RPMI 1640 medium; GibcoBRL, Paisley, UK), supplemented with HAT (5 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 20 \u03bcM aminopterin and 0.8 mM thymidine, GibcoBRL).

Hybridomas secreting the highest levels of detectable mAbs were cloned by limiting dilution, subcloned twice and expanded in vitro (Cl-1000, Integra Biosciences, Hertfordshire, UK). The mAbs were then purified using a protein G affinity column (HiTrap Protein G, Amersham). Purified mAbs were eluted from the column according to the manufacturer's protocol and transferred to a storage buffer (0.05 M Na2HPO4, 0.1% NaN3, pH 7.0) using a PD-10 column (Amersham).

After two washes in PBS, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde before permeabilisation with 1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) in fluorescence buffer (0.5% BSA, 1 mM NaN3 in PBS). Permeabilised cells were incubated with D9-FITC mAb (2 \u03bcg /106 cells), or an isotype-matched control mAb FITC (6 \u03bcg/106 cells, Southern Biotechnology), for 30 min in the dark at RT, or remained unstained. The cells were washed three times and stored in fluorescence buffer prior to analysis on a flow cytometer (EPICS XL-MCL\u2122, Beckman Coulter, California, USA), using Expo 32 ADC software (Beckman Coulter). The small lymphocyte and lymphoblast populations were gated on the basis of cell size and granularity (forward and side scatter). For each sample 10,000 events were recorded, and the percentage of fIFN-\u03b3-expressing CD4+T cells within the lymphoblast population was calculated.",

These cats developed a transient viraemia subsequent to oronasal exposure to FeLV, after which it was no longer possible to isolate FeLV from the blood.

Therefore, the capacity of virus-specific CD4+T cells to activate CD8+T cells through the production of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 should be a key factor in the control of viraemia (Rosenberg et al., 1997). Our initial studies reveal that p27-specific and p45-specific CD4+T cells reside in the lymph nodes of latently infected cats.
