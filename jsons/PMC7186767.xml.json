Among these challenges are \u201cCan AI help track and predict the spread of the infection?\u201d, \u201cCan AI help in making diagnoses and prognoses?\u201d, \u201cCan it be used in the search for treatments and a vaccine?\u201d and \u201cCan it be used for social control?\u201d This paper is an attempt to provide an early review of how AI have so far been contributing in this regard, and to note limitations, constraints, and pitfalls. These include a lack of data, too much (noisy and outlier) data, and growing tension between data privacy concerns and public health imperatives.",

In fact, an AI-based model of HealthMap, at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital (USA), sounded one of the first alarms on 30 December 2019, around 30 minutes earlier than a scientist at the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (PMED) issued an alert (see the discussion in Naud\u00e9 2020). For the further tracking and prediction of how COVID-19 will spread, however, AI has so far not been very useful. This is for a number of reasons. The first is that AI requires data on COVID-19 to train. An example of how this can be done is the case of the 2015 Zika- virus, whose spread was ex post predicted using a dynamic neural network (Akhtar et al. 2019). Because COVID-19 is different from Zika, or other infections, and because there are at the time of writing still not sufficient data to build AI models that can track and forecast its spread. Most of the growing number of publications reporting on using AI for diagnostic and predictive purposes so far tend to use small, possibly biased, and mostly Chinese-based samples, and have not been peer-reviewed.",

It is not only a lack of historical training data but also due to problems with using \u201cbig data\u201d, e.g., such as harvested from social media. The pitfalls of big data and AI in the context of infectious diseases was illustrated in the infamous failure of Google Flu Trends. Lazer et al. (2014) referred to these as \u201cbig data hubris and algorithm dynamics\u201d. For instance, as the infection continues to spread, the social media traffic around it accumulates, so the amount of noise accumulates which has to be filtered through before meaningful trends can be discerned. Generally, and this is also bad news for AI forecasting models in other fields, including economics and finance, since for any prediction algorithm that rely on past behavior, a global outlier event with its mass of new and unprecedented data, such as COVID-19, can be described as Rowan (2020) does as \u201cthe kryptonite of modern Artificial intelligence\u201d. As a result, he concludes that over the near future \u201cmany industries are going to be pulling the humans back into the forecasting chair that had been taken from them by the models\u201d.",

Hence, so far, most models used for tracking and forecasting do not use AI methods. Instead, most forecasters prefer established epidemiological models, so-called SIR models Song et al. (2020). For example, the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin uses an epidemiological SIR model that takes into account containment measures by governments, such as lockdowns, quarantines, and social distancing prescriptions. Its model has been applied to China to illustrate that containment can be successful in reducing the spread to slower than exponential rates\u2014see Maier and Brockmann (2020).",

In fact, this is perhaps where most of the first rush of AI initiatives focused on. Fast and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 can save lives, limit the spread of the disease, and generate data on which to train AI models. There is growing effort to train AI models to diagnose COVID-19 using chest radiography images. According to a recent review of AI applications against COVID-19 by Bullock et al. (2020), argues that AI can be as accurate as humans, can save radiologists\u2019 time, and perform a diagnosis faster and cheaper than with standard tests for COVID-19. Both X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans can be used. Representative contributions in this regard include Chen et al. (2020b) and Wang and Wong (2020). The latter developed COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network (see e.g. Rawat and Wang (2017)), which can diagnose COVID-19 from chest radiography images. It has been trained on open repository data from around 13,000 patients with various lung conditions, including COVID-19. However, as the authors indicate, it is \u201cby no means a production-ready solution\u201d, and they call on the scientific community to develop it further, in particular to \u201cimprove sensitivity\u201d (Rawat and Wang 2017, p. 6).",

Indeed, the use of CT scans in European hospitals has dropped after the pandemic broke, perhaps reflecting this concern (Ross and Robbins 2020).

In the case of COVID-19, a number of research labs and data centers have already indicated that they are recruiting AI to search for treatments for and a vaccine against COVID-19. The hope is that AI can accelerate both the processes of discovering new drugs as well as for repurposing existing drugs. A number of researchers have already reported discovering drugs for repurposing. These include Beck et al. (2020) who report results from using Machine Learning to identify that an existing drug, atazanavir, could potentially be repurposed to treat COVID-19, and Stebbing et al.

For example, as described by Chun (2020) \u201cAt airports and train stations across China, infrared cameras are used to scan crowds for high temperatures. They are sometimes used with a facial recognition system, which can pinpoint the individual with a high temperature and whether he or she is wearing a surgical mask.\u201d It is reported that these cameras can scan 200 persons per minute and will recognize those whose body temperature exceeds 37.3\u00b0 (Dickson 2020). Thermal imaging has, however, been criticized as being inadequate to identify from a distance a fever in people who are wearing glasses (because scanning the inner tear duct gives the most reliable indication) and because it cannot identify whether a person\u2019s temperature is raided because of COVID-19 or some other reason (Carroll 2020).",
