RT-PCR testing has substituted viral cultures as gold-standard because of the high accuracy and better timing [3]. Nasopharyngeal swabs are considered easy and quick to collect, they are not time-consuming and they can be performed anywhere, even to people sitting in a car. Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered more sensitive than nasopharyngeal specimens, with a sensitivity around 97%, but its use is limited to critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. More recently, serologic tests have to gain attention for their potential of screening wider populations, identifying uninfected and/or healed subjects and thus directing future policies. So far, though, they are still under investigation and their current role is, therefore, limited [2].",

Reaching the nasopharynx with a swab is not easy: the intranasal anatomy is highly variable (e.g. hypertrophic inferior turbinates, deviated septum, conchae bullosae, synechiae) and this factor, coupled with patients\u2019 discomfort, may result in a flawed sampling of the nasal cavity, the inferior turbinate or the middle meatus instead. We hypothesize that part of these limited results may be linked to a wrong diagnostic procedure performed collecting the swabs.",

Formal educational programs already exist because of previous epidemics, such as the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [6], but on many iconographic materials one can often see swabs positioned vertically or introduced into the nasal cavity only for few centimeters, thus potentially ending up in an inaccurate procedure. It would be invaluable to train healthcare personnel with the aid of a live endonasal endoscopic demonstration of nasal and nasopharyngeal anatomy and sampling, and in this field the active role of the otolaryngologist becomes very relevant (Fig. 1).",

Even patients referred less discomfort during the sampling procedure and were obviously more compliant.",
