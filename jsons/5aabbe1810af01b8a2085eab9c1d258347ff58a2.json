            "text": "However, little is known about the current evolution and therapeutic limitations of HFOV. We therefore aimed to describe its use in clinical practice and predict the risk of mortality for neonates receiving HfoV. A retrospective observational study of all neonates treated with HfoV in a quaternary referral NICU between January 2007 and December 2016 was conducted. We classified these patients into five subgroups based on primary respiratory diagnoses. We performed the logistic regression and decision tree regression analyses to identify independent factors of 30-day mortality following HFOV. A total of 1125 patients who were ever supported on HFOV were enrolled, of whom 64.1% received HFOV as a rescue therapy, 27.2% received it as an elective therapy, and 8.7% received it for air leak. An average oxygenation index (OI) greater than 25 in the first 24 hours after the initiation of HFOV and patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension were found to have the greatest risk of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.0001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 25.8% (290/1125). Decision tree regression analysis revealed that neonates with refractory respiratory failure who had a pre-HfoV oi value higher than 20.5 and OI values higher than 21.5, 23.5 and 34 at 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours after the use of HFOV, respectively, had a significantly increased risk of 30-day mortality. We identified the predictors and cutoff points of OI before and after the initiation of HFOV in neonates with respiratory failure, which can be clinically used as a reference for 30-day mortality. Further efforts are still needed to optimize the outcomes.",

Several recently published studies have demonstrated that HFOV can improve oxygenation efficiently and decrease the mortality risk of critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and it has very minimal hemodynamic side effects 3-5 . In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the early use of HFOV has been suggested to be a safer and more effective rescue strategy for neonates with meconium aspiratory syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, severe pulmonary hypertension, or air leak syndrome 6-11 .",

Cools et al. concluded that HFOV seems more effective across various subpopulations of preterm infants 12, 13 , and HFOV has been increasingly used in NICUs for patients who do not respond to or tolerate conventional ventilation. However, few studies have broadly reflected the practices and outcomes of neonates who receive HFOV, and there is a paucity of data regarding the risk factors of mortality or treatment failure. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to describe the evolution of HFOV clinical practice in the NICU over the past 10 years as well as the predictive determinants of 30-day mortality after neonates receiving HFOV.",

Patients are sedated with fentanyl and/or midazolam and, if needed, given a muscle relaxant. In newborns with systemic hypotension, the cardiovascular inotropic agents administered include dopamine and dobutamine (both maximum 20 \u03bcg/kg/min), milrinone (maximum 1 \u03bcg/kg/min) and/ or epinephrine (maximum 1 \u03bcg/kg/min) 18 . For persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (PPHN), iNO (Solmix 1000; Dutch Technical Gas Company, Tilburg, The Netherlands) is added from 20 ppm to a maximum of 80 ppm, based on the clinical responses 18, 19 . Surfactant (beractant, Sruventa; Ross Laboratories, Columbus, PH; one dose = 100 mg/kg) is administered to newborns with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Finally, HFOV (Loudspeaker type, 3100 A; SensorMedics Corporation, Yorba Linda, CA) is used when conventional ventilation fails to improve oxygenation and/or in the presence of severe hypercapnia or barotraumas 18,19 . Data collection and definitions. All patients receiving HFOV during the study period were reviewed, and the following information was collected and recorded on the case report form: the etiology of respiratory distress, underlying comorbidities, conventional ventilator management prior to and after HFOV, arterial blood gas data, ventilation mode and ventilator settings on HFOV for the first 72 hours, use of iNO, surfactant, inotropic and vasopressor agents and patient outcomes. FiO 2 values and ventilator settings at the time of each blood gas determination were recorded by the respiratory therapists. The corresponding AaDO 2 was calculated using the formula AaDO 2 = (Patm \u2212 47) \u00d7 FiO 2 \u2212 (PaO 2 + PaCO 2 ) 9 . For patients with respiratory failure treated by HFOV more than once during hospitalization, the second HFOV run was considered an independent event if the patient was successfully weaned after the first HFOV event and the second event occurred more than 30 days after the first event. For final outcome analyses, the episode of more severe respiratory failure (based on higher initial OI) was considered for analysis.",

The pre-HFOV OI and the OIs on the first day at three different points after the use of HFOV were evaluated. We found that an OI of 20.5 immediately preceding the use of HFOV, an OI of 21.5 within 2 hours after initiation of HFOV, an OI greater than 23.5 at 6 hours and an OI greater than 34.5 at 12 hours after initiation of HFOV had the highest predictive power of 30-day mortality.

In the current study, we found that neonates with secondary pulmonary hypertension had the highest mortality risk, and the probability of 30-day mortality risk could be estimated by computing the OIs on conventional ventilations before initiation of HFOV and 2, 6, and 12 hours after use of HFOV.

We also found that the OIs recorded after the initiation of HFOV were always higher than those recorded on conventional ventilation preceding HFOV, which was consistent with other studies 1, 24 . Therefore, we suspect that the data on conventional ventilation immediately preceding the use of HFOV cannot reflect the real indication of HFOV use. It is possible that adverse hemodynamic effects from pulmonary diseases, hypoxemia, hypercarbia or a combination of these factors make these conditions continuously worsen. It takes some time for the therapeutic effects of HFOV to reverse hypoxemia or hypercarbia. In addition, some neonates in the subgroup of elective HFOV use experienced deterioration while receiving HFOV treatment and 11.4% in this group ultimately died. It is possible that these patients eventually required rescue HFOV support or ECMO. We did not use conventional ventilation until maximal support, and those without OIs greater than 16 could be considered as preemptive use but not a primary mode of ventilation. The mortality rate of our cohort treated with HFOV was high and did not show a trend of improvement. However, not all patients died of refractory hypoxemia 19, 24 . In our institute, we always use HFOV as the final rescue therapy for critically ill neonates with cardiopulmonary failure. These patients contributed to a significant proportion of mortality, which could mask the therapeutic effects of HFOV. Most of the patients died of underlying diseases or secondary nosocomial infections instead of hypoxemia and pulmonary diseases. The area under the curve in the ROC plot was between 0.687 and 0.748, which are acceptable but not very powerful values. Neonates with a hemodynamically stable condition and good response to the use of HFOV may have later died of sepsis or other chronic comorbidities. Therefore, it is difficult to have highly distinctive OI cutoff points with a better predictive value.",

Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have expressed concern that the use of iNO therapy is extremely low birth weight infants could increase the risk of IVH 33, 34 . Despite this safety concern, the off-label use of iNO in extremely hypoxemic preterm infants on maximal ventilator support has been investigated recently, and the beneficial effects were found to outweigh the disadvantages without an increased risk of IVH 18, 35 .",

Although HFOV is not a standard treatment for neonates with air leak, it can have beneficial effects on the prevention of recurrent pneumothorax and reverse severe hypercapnia 36, 37 . For low birth weight infants, the lower mean frequency of our preterm infants www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ under HFOV (12~13) is due to the ventilator machine, with Babylog 8000 (Dr\u00e4ger, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) switched from conventional mode to HFOV mode. Under this machine, a lower mean frequency is capable of preventing or reversing CO2 retention. It should be noted that HFOV is not routinely used at our institute in neonates with air leak. We categorized these patients because the air leak worsened their underlying pulmonary diseases in most situations and HFOV became the rescue strategy.",

First, the initiation of HFOV was based on the attending physician's decision, and the indication to change from conventional ventilation to HFOV is not yet standardized. Because there is no control group and we did not compare our study subjects with those without the HFOV treatment, we can not comment on the beneficial effects or disadvantages of HFOV over conventional ventilation. Second, this is a single retrospective study. Some of the parameters were not controlled and may be adjusted after some treatments. Finally, categorizing these patients into distinct disease subgroups may have led to some ambiguity, which may have resulted in statistical deviations. However, the strengths of this study include the large sample size, the prospectively collected database with detailed and accurate parameters of ventilatory settings at various time points and the concisely defined responses. Therefore, the predictive OI cutoff points at four stages are convincing and can be clinically used as a reference for clinicians to explain patient prognosis in discussions with family members.",
