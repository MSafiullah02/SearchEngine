Surgery was performed on November 2016 and accomplished, less invasively, through an upper \u201cJ\u201d mini-sternotomy and left lateral minithoracotomy, on beating heart and femoro-femoral cardiopulmonary bypass establishment. LVAD system has been running uneventfully for 1,170 postoperative days, and the patient has joined a routine monthly ambulatory visit at our transplant outpatient care unit. Laboratory, echo, chest x-ray, angio-computed tomography (CT) scan evaluations have been historically acceptable and never of notice. The patient has returned to a quite normal daily life, thus rejoining his own family and friends, driving and travelling as being always asymptomatic and feeling personally confident with a strict self-management of LVAD peripherals, tools, and wound site medications and dressing, as well.",
