As illustrated in Table 13 .1, most CTL ligands (CTLLs) are from exogenous sources, although several examples of endogenous CTLLs can also be found. Most CTLLs contain a glycan motif; however, the breath of CTLLs is diverse and also includes proteins and oligonucleotides, as well as molecules whose structure is still to be determined. There are also several CTLs, such as CLEC12B, CLEC1-1, DCAL-1, DCAR and mDCAR1, for which there are no known ligands. As previous chapters in this book have focussed on the biochemical pathways and immunomodulatory activities of the CTLs, our focus herein has been to showcase the CTLLs and, where relevant, to highlight the degree of structural variation each CTL can tolerate. By doing so, we hope to equip the reader with a more readily digestible data set on the vast array of CTLLs and to encourage natural products or synthetic chemists to identify new, or further refine, ligands for these receptors.

Although the exact ligand structure for Dectin-2 is not well defined, carbohydrate binding studies have revealed that Dectin-2 recognises high-mannose structures such as Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ( Fig. 13 .1) (McGreal et al. 2006 ). Here, Dectin-2 was screened against 109 synthetic carbohydrates, and although Dectin-2 displayed the highest specificity for Man 9 GlcNAc 2 , it also recognised Man 8 GlcNAc 2 and Man 7 GlcNAc 2 .

MDL-1 has been shown to bind the dengue virion (DV), resulting in DAP12 phosphorylation and cytokine production (Chen et al. 2008) . If, on the other hand, the DV-MDL-1 interaction is blocked with monoclonal antibodies, symptoms associated with DV infection, such as plasma leakage and vital organ haemorrhaging, were reduced in a murine model. In addition to the dengue virion, MDL-1 also directly interacts with the Japanese encephalitis virus and induces cytokine production by M\u03c6s (Chen et al. 2012) . MDL-1 knockout or blocking with an MDL-1 antibody was shown to reduce the symptoms of arthritis, which indicates that there may be an unidentified self-ligand for MDL-1 (Joyce-Shaikh et al. 2010). The same authors later proposed that galectin-9 was a ligand for MDL-1 and demonstrated that treatment with galectin-9 intensified disease in a murine model of arthritis (Joyce-Shaikh et al. 2014 ).",

BDCA-2 expression is restricted to human plasmacytoid DCs (Dzionek et al. 2001) , and the targeting of antigens to this receptor has been suggested to be a promising strategy for inducing antigen-specific tolerance. BDCA-2 was first shown to bind the HIV protein, gp120, leading to the inhibition of toll-like receptor (TLR)-9-mediated activation and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 secretion in plasmacytoid DCs (Martinelli et al. 2007) , while more recently it was determined that BDCA-2 recognises complex-type sugars that have lost their terminal sialic residues ( Fig. 13.1 Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man\u03b11-3(Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man\u03b11-6)-Man\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b2 and Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man\u03b11-3(Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man\u03b11-6)-Man\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b2 (Riboldi et al. 2011) .

In a ligand-binding study that employed an NFAT-GFP reporter cell line and Mincle-deficient mice, it was demonstrated that trehalose dimycolate (TDM), the most abundant glycolipid in the mycobacterial cell wall, is a ligand for Mincle (Ishikawa et al. 2009 ). TDMs consist of a trehalose disaccharide core bound to two mycolic acid chains, which can be of varying structural complexity ( Fig. 13 .1). Additionally, both human and murine Mincle have been shown to recognise the yeast species Candida albicans (Bugarcic et al. 2008; Wells et al. 2008 ) and the fungal species Malassezia (Yamasaki et al. 2009 ). In Malassezia fungal species, specific mannitol-containing ligands were identified as direct ligands for Mincle (Ishikawa et al. 2013 ). Mincle has also been shown to sense dead cells through a protein component of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SAP30) (Yamasaki et al. 2008 ). Structure-activity relationship studies have since confirmed that many simple TDM synthetic analogues also bind Mincle. Specifically, long-chain trehalose diesters (TDEs), including trehalose dibehenate (TDB), have been found to lead to the robust activation of M\u03c6s (Schoenen et al. 2010; Khan et al. 2011) , while more recently it has been demonstrated that trehalose esters with only one lipid chain (trehalose monoesters, TMEs) can also bind and activate Mincle (Stocker et al. 2014) . Moreover, functionalised trehalose glycolipids, including those containing fluorescent reporter groups or photoaffinity probes, have also been shown to bind and activate Mincle (Khan et al. 2013; Kodar et al. 2015) . In addition to trehalose diesters, another mycobacterial immunostimulatory lipid, glycerol monomycolate, has been shown to activate human but not mouse Mincle (Hattori et al. 2014) . Corynomycolic esters of trehalose (TDCM) were also found to be potent activators of both mouse and human Mincle, while 2-S-corynomycolic esters of glycerol were found to activate human but not mouse Mincle (van der Peet et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Dectin-1 (also known as CLEC7a) was the first non-toll-like receptor shown to mediate its own intracellular signalling (Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012). The receptor was originally found to recognise an endogenous T-cell ligand of unknown structure (Ariizumi et al. 2000) and has since been shown to bind other endogenous ligands including undefined N-glycans on the surface of tumour cells, which leads to tumour destruction by natural killer (NK) cells (Chiba et al. 2014) , and vimentin (a type III intermediate filament protein) (Thiagarajan et al. 2013 ). An unknown ligand in mycobacteria also binds Dectin-1 (Yadav and Schorey 2006; Rothfuchs et al. 2007 ). The most insight into the structure of the Dectin-1 ligands, however, concerns the ability of the receptor to bind glucans, particularly \u03b2-1,3-glucans ( Fig. 13 .1), which are found in the cell wall of plants and fungi (Brown and Gordon 2001; Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012) . Microarray studies suggest that ten to eleven \u03b2-1,3-linked glucose oligomers are required for optimal Dectin-1 binding, and while \u03b2-1,6-glucans of comparable length do not bind (Palma et al. 2006) , branched \u03b2-1,3-glucans do bind to the receptor (Palma et al. 2006; Adams et al. 2008) . More recent studies have demonstrated that smaller glucan mimetics can also bind Dectin-1, as evidenced by studies using synthetic \u03b2-glu6 containing an \u03b1-(1!3)linked bond (Li et al. 2013 ) and di-and trimeric hydroxylamine-based mimetics (Ferry et al. 2014 ). In the latter study, the binding of the small oligosaccharide fragments was attributed to the increased hydrophobic interaction between the \u03b1-face of the di-or trisaccharide and the aromatic side chains of Trp 221 ad His 223 in the binding site of Dectin-1. A distinction has also been made between the binding of soluble and particulate glucans. Different downstream Dectin-1 signalling occurs when myeloid cells come into contract with particulate \u03b2-glucan, and in particular, that prolonged Dectin-1 signalling occurs when myeloid cells come into contact with large \u03b2-glucan particles (Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012). A few polysaccharides can also interfere with the binding of \u03b2-glucans to Dectin-1, thereby thwarting the host immune response. These include chitin-like components found on sclerotic cells in murine models of chromoblastomycosis (Dong et al. 2014 ) and \u03b1-(1,3)-glucan, which is a cell wall constituent of most fungal respiratory pathogens (Rappleye et al. 2007 ).",

CLEC-2 was discovered with CLEC-1 in a bioinformatics screen for NK receptors, and while mRNA for CLEC-2 has been found in bone marrow cells, DCs, monocytes, granulocytes and some NK cell populations, most studies have focussed on the role of CLEC-2 on platelets (Plato et al. 2013) . Several CLEC-2 ligands have been identified, including rhodocytin (aggretin), which is an exogenous multimeric protein found in snake venom that leads to platelet activation and aggregation and subsequent coagulation of the blood (Suzuki-Inoue et al. 2011) . Soon thereafter, the endogenous protein podoplanin was found to be a ligand for CLEC-2 (Suzuki-Inoue et al. 2007 ). Podoplanin is found in multiple cell types such as lymphatic endothelial cells, type I lung alveolar cells and in some cancer cells and consists of the sialylated glycan NeuAc\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3(NeuAc\u03b12-6)GalNAc ( Fig. 13 .1) conjugated via an \u03b1-linkage to Thr52 in the platelet aggregation-stimulating domain (Kaneko et al. 2007 ). Both the disialyl core and the stereostructure of the protein were found to be critical for CLEC-2 binding, as evidenced by the observation that CLEC-2-Fc terminal deletion mutants and human podoplanin glycopeptides containing truncated glycans were unable to bind the receptor (Kato et al. 2008 ). Fucoidan ( Fig. 13.1 ), which is a sulphated polysaccharide from Fucus vesiculosus, is an agonist for CLEC-2 (Manne et al. 2013) , and HIV is also thought to be recognised by CLEC-2, although it is proposed that this recognition is due to the incorporation of a host protein into HIV during budding (Suzuki-Inoue et al. 2011 ). Finally, a series of synthetically prepared nucleic acid CLEC-2 ligands (aptamers) were identified using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) methodology (Layzer et al. 2010 ).",

Ligand studies using transfected non-macrophage cell lines demonstrated that SIGN-R3 endocytosed dextran of 40 kDa or greater and zymosan (Takahara et al. 2004) . A comprehensive glycan array analysis further refined the SIGN-R3 ligands and demonstrated that SIGN-R3 preferentially binds to high-mannose glycans and fucosylated glycans, particularly Lewis a (Le a ) and Le b antigens ( Fig. 13 .1) (Galustian et al. 2004) , with subsequent array studies supporting these findings (Powlesland et al. 2006) . SIGN-R3 has been found to contribute to early host resistance to M. tuberculosis infection with mycobaterial ManLAM and LM, but not AraLAM, binding and activating the receptor (Tanne et al. 2009 ). More recently, SIGN-R3 has been shown to play a role in leishmaniasis infection (Lef\u00e8vre et al. 2013) and to recognise ligands in commensal fungi and bacteria thereby potentially mediating colitis (Eriksson et al. 2013; Lightfoot et al. 2015) ; however, in each study, the specific ligand was not identified.",

DC-SIGN has a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and binds branched D-mannose and L-fucose motifs common on pathogen surfaces (Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012), with clustering of the lectins resulting in the formation of tetramers to enhance ligand binding (Mitchell et al. 2001 ). High-mannose oligosaccharide ligands include mannan, mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM, Fig. 13 .2) , phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM, Fig. 13 .2) (Driessen et al. 2009 ) and Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ( Fig. 13.1) , whereby the latter binds DC-SIGN with 130 times higher affinity than mannose (Mitchell et al. 2001 ). DC-SIGN has a higher affinity for L-fucose than mannose and recognises branched fucosylated structures with terminal galactose residues, such as the Lewis antigens (Coombs et al. 2005) , in particular Le x and possibly LDNF (Fig. 13 .2) (van Die et al. 2003) . DC-SIGN binds Helicobacter pylori (Miszczyk et al. 2012 ) and S. mansoni (Meyer et al. 2005 ) through the Le x and Le y antigens, while Mycobacterium tuberculosis is recognised via ManLAM , PIM (Driessen et al. 2009 ) and \u03b1-glucan (Geurtsen et al. 2009 ), as well as further unidentified ligands (Ehlers 2010) . Although this implies broad specificity for branched sugars, DC-SIGN discriminates between ligands through secondary binding sites and the \u03b1/\u03b2-linkage of adjacent saccharides (van Die et al. 2003) . The signalling pathways induced by DC-SIGN are dependent on the nature of the ligand, leading to endocytosis or modulation of gene expression (Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012). Endogenous ligands include tumour-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72) (Laskarin et al. 2011 ) and semen clusterin (Sabatte et al. 2011) , while DC-SIGN acts as a receptor for HIV through binding to the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein (Curtis et al. 1992 ).",

In contrast to DC-SIGN which is expressed on DCs, L-SIGN is highly expressed on liver sinusoidal cells, endothelial vascular cells and in the lymph nodes. Like DC-SIGN, L-SIGN has high-affinity binding to a variety of ligands, including ICAM-3, HIV gp120-binding protein, simian immunodeficiency virus, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus and respiratory syncytial virus. The CRD of L-SIGN binds the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide ( Fig. 13.1 ) 17-fold more tightly than mannose, and its affinity for a glycopeptide bearing two Man 9 GlcNAc 2 oligosaccharides is further increased by fivefold to 25-fold. These results indicate that the CRDs contain extended or secondary oligosaccharide binding sites. When the CRDs are clustered in the tetrameric extracellular domain, their arrangement provides a means of amplifying specificity for multiple glycans on host molecules targeted by DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (Mitchell et al. 2001) .",

LSECtin functions as an attachment factor for Ebola virus and SARS, but it does not bind HIV or hepatitis C virus (Gramberg et al. 2005) . LSECtin exhibits ligand-induced internalisation, and its sugar recognition specificity differs from that of DC-SIGN, as sugar-binding studies indicate that LSECtin specifically recognises N-acetyl-glucosamine (Dominguez-Soto et al. 2007 ) and L-fucose (Liu et al. 2004) , whereas no LSECtin binding to mannan, N-acetyl-galactosamine and galactose were observed.

Langerin recognises a wide array of carbohydrates including mannose, fucose and GlcNAc structures and especially Man 9 GlcNAc 2 (Stambach et al. 2003) . Langerin also recognises the difucosylated oligosaccharide Le y (Holla et al. 2011) and Le x -type sequences that are sulphated at the 6-position of the outer galactose (6 0 -sulfo-3 0 -SLe x , Fig. 13.3 ). This specificity is unique among the CTLs and contrasts markedly with the selectins which bind the analogous Le x structures that are sulphated at the 3-position of the galactose. Of the sulphated saccharides, Langerin has also been shown to bind dextran-sulphate (Galustian et al. 2004 ) and 6-sulphated GlcNAc and especially 6 0 -sulfo-LacNAc (Tateno et al. 2010) , whereas no binding was observed for either its positional isomer, 6-sulfo-LacNAc, or its unsulphated form. Langerin also binds to glioblastoma tissues via Gal-6-sulphated glycans (Tateno et al. 2010) . Taken together, this suggests that the sulphate at C-6 of the non-reducing end sugar might be important for Langerin recognition.",

Also Candida and Saccharomyces species and Malassezia furfur are recognised by langerin, but very weak binding was observed to Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans. No binding was observed for the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (Takahara et al. 2004) . Notably, Langerin has been identified as the primary fungal receptor on Langerhans cells (LCs), since the interaction of LCs with fungi was blocked by antibodies against Langerin. Langerin recognises both mannose and \u03b2-glucans present on fungal cell walls and appears to be an important fungal pathogen receptor on human LCs that recognises pathogenic and commensal fungi (De Jong et al. 2010) .

MGL specifically recognises \u03b1and \u03b2-linked GalNAc residues (Suzuki et al. 1996) , including the Tn antigen and LacdiNAc ( Fig. 13 .3) and 6-substituted GalNAc derivatives such as the sialyl-Tn antigen (Mortezai et al. 2013 ). In addition, MGL binds to CD45 on effector T cells and interacts with lymphatic endothelial cells through an unknown ligand. Of the self-antigens, MGL binds to the GalNAc moieties on the tumour-derived MUC1 and MUC2 glycoproteins (Iida et al. 1999 ",

            "text": "The mouse CTL MGL-1 (CD301a, CLEC-10a) is one of the two hMGL orthologues with distinct carbohydrate recognition. Early studies demonstrated that mMGL-1 recognises galactose-related structures such as Le x (Tsuiji et al. 2002) . Using a glycan array, murine MGL-1 was found to be highly specific for Le x and Le a structures. The generation of MGL-1-Fc proteins allowed the identification of high endothelial venules as ligands in the lymph nodes (Singh et al. 2009 ), while the incubation of arrays with an MGL-1-hFc fusion protein showed up to tenfold increased binding to multiantennary N-glycans displaying Le x structures compared to monovalent Le x trisaccharide . In another glycan array, MGL-1 was found to bind to a range of terminal galactose and GalNAc glycans, which is consistent with the known galactose-binding motif QPD in the CRD of MGL-1. In these studies, MGL-1-Fc was found to bind the stage-specific tumour antigen Gb5 (Fig. 13.3) , which suggests an association of this interaction with tumour progression . MGL-1 also binds Trypanosoma cruzi, presumably through surface-expressed galactose moieties (V\u00e1zquez et al. 2014) , and triggers phosphorylation of Raf-1 in response to products excreted/secreted by the helminth parasite Taenia crassiceps, thereby being involved in the induction of Th2 responses against the parasite (Terrazas et al. 2013) . MGL-1 acts as an attachment and entry receptor for influenza virus, independent of sialic acid expression (Upham et al. 2010; Ng et al. 2014 ). Recombinant MGL-1 was found to bind both Streptococcus sp. and Lactobacillus sp. among commensal bacteria isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes of mice treated with dextran sulphate sodium salt (DSS) (Saba et al. 2009). 13.5.8 MGL-2 MGL-2 (CD301b) recognises carbohydrates containing GalNAc, which is similar to the carbohydrate specificity of human MGL (Tsuiji et al. 2002) . Using a glycan array, MGL-2 was found to recognise GalNAc and galactose, including the O-linked Tn-and TF-antigens and core 2 O-GalNAc glycans ( Fig. 13.3) . Strikingly, MGL-2 interacted strongly with adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting a potential role in tumour immunity (Singh et al. 2009 ). MGL-2 specifically binds tumourassociated GalNAc, and modification of an antigen with GalNAc targeted the antigen specifically to the MGL-2 on bone marrow-derived (BM) DCs and splenic DCs and promoted antigen internalisation in DCs and presentation to CD4 T cells, as well as differentiation of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4 T cells (Singh et al. 2011) . Mice infected with the natural rodent hookworm pathogen Nippostrongylus brasiliensis required MGL-2 \u00fe DCs for efficient Th2 development, but these cells were dispensable for T follicular helper or B-cell responses, as MGL-2 \u00fe DC-depleted animals showed normal levels of IgG1 and IgE antibodies (Kumamoto et al. 2013 ).",

The first class is modified lipoproteins including ox-LDL (Sawamura et al. 1997) , hypochlorite-modified high-density lipoprotein (HOCl-HDL) (Marsche et al. 2001) , carbamylated LDL (Apostolov et al. 2009 ), electronegative LDL (Lu et al. 2009 ), apolipoprotein B (Gillotte et al. 2000; Okamura et al. 2013 , and advanced glycation end product (AGE) proteins (Jono et al. 2002) . Native LDL is not recognised by LOX-1 (Yoshimoto et al. 2011) , while some studies suggest that acetylated LDL is recognised (Shi et al. 2001) , and others indicate it is not (Moriwaki et al. 1998 ). The second group of ligands are polyanionic structures including polyinosinic acid and carrageenan (Moriwaki et al. 1998) . Anionic phospholipids are also recognised, including the cellular ligands phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Fig. 13. 3) (Oka et al. 1998) , which are expressed on apoptotic and aged cells. Cellular ligands comprise the fourth group; however, the exact molecules recognised by LOX-1 on these cells are less well defined. Apoptotic cells (Oka et al. 1998) , platelets (Kakutani et al. 2000) and both Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus are recognised (Shimaoka et al. 2001) . Finally, other macromolecules that act as LOX-1 ligands include bile salt-dependent lipase (Chen and Du 2007) , heats-hock proteins (Murshid et al. 2011 ) and C-reactive proteins (Shih et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "The mannose receptor (MR), also known as CD-206, is a 175-kDa transmembrane C-type lectin widely expressed on tissue M\u03c6s and DCs (Martinez-Pomares 2012). MR binds branched high-mannose-containing motifs, such as ManLAM (Kang et al. 2005 ) and mannan (Taylor et al. 1992) , and while MR preferentially binds branched \u03b1-linked oligomannoses, its specificity is not limited to D-mannosecontaining glycoconjugates. Affinity binding competition studies demonstrate that MR binds to glycoconjugates with the following specificity: L-Fuc \u00bc D-Man > D-GlcNac D-Glc > D-Xyl >> D-Gal \u00bc L-Ara \u00bc D-Fuc, while galactose and GalNAc do not bind (Shepherd et al. 1981) . Ligand binding is mediated by eight tandem CRDs, and while CRDs 1-3 have weak ligand binding, CRD-4 is able to elicit monosaccharide binding, and CRDs 4-8 are necessary for the binding of complex glycans (Mullin et al. 1994; Taylor et al. 1992 ). MR has a secondary lectin binding site located at the cysteine-rich N-terminus of the protein, and this mediates binding to sulphated sugar residues (Leteux et al. 2000) , with special affinity for GalNAc residues sulphated at the 3-and 4-positions, including chondroitin sulphates A and B and sulphated Le x and Le a .",

Some CTLs have been studied for many years, and, accordingly, their associated ligands are, by and large, well defined; however, for other CTLs, and especially those that appear to accommodate a vast array of ligands, much remains unknown about the specificity of ligand binding and how this influences the immune response. It is without a doubt that insight into the specific ligand structure for such CTLs will further assist in understanding how pathogens can either be recognised by the immune system or how they can thwart the immune response. Moreover, the association between CTLs and endogenous ligands can assist in understanding deleterious cellular process such as tumour growth and also regular cellular 'housekeeping' processes, such as debris clearance. Thus, it is imperative that immunologists and chemists continue to work closely together in order to determine how CTL-ligand interactions influence the many varied aspects of the immunology.",
