Such individuals included, for example, donors who provided blood used for transfusions associated with AIDS development or blood product preparations given to hemophiliacs (Curran et al., 1984; Essex et al., 1983b) . Patients from high risk categories, such as homosexual men and injection drug users, were also similarly screened when they experienced symptoms such as lymphadenopathy or oral candidiasis. A second approach to screen AIDS patients involved assays for reverse transcriptase activity using enzyme conditions that had been developed for HTLV-1 ( Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983; Gelmann et al., 1983) . A third major approach was the use of electron microscopy, to determine if particles similar to retroviruses could be found in tissues from AIDS patients (Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983) .

The second was the wide range of lethal clinical outcomes.

It appears that captive Asian monkeys in research colonies initially became infected when injected with experimental materials. Furthermore, Asian monkeys become sick with an AIDS-like illness when injected with SIVs, whereas African monkeys or apes do not become ill when injected with SIVs and/or HIVs.",

It is still not clear whether certain subtypes of HIV-1 entered people independently from subhuman primates, or diverged to form distinct subtypes after they already existed in people. In the case of HIV-1B and HIV-1D, it is most likely that they diverged in people, as these viruses are more similar than either is to other subtypes. In the case of HIV-1C and HIV-1A, it seems possible that they entered separately into the human population.",

Although HIV-1B, from the west, was the first virus detected in injection drug-users in Bangkok, it was rapidly overtaken by CRF01_AE, which now predominates in Thailand, Myanmar, and the Kunming region of China. Another recombinant, CRF02_AG, is the second most common virus in the world, predominating in the countries of West and West Central Africa (Essex & Mboup, 2002) . The viruses that are most important in China at present are CRFs made as recombinants of HIV-1B and HIV-1C. The two that are most common are designated CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC (Piyasirisilp et al., 2000; Su et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2005) .

The use of only one or two drugs happened more often in earlier stages of the epidemic, when fewer drugs were available, but it is also widely practiced when chemoprophylaxis is used to reduce the transmission of HIV from infected mothers to their infants. Antiretroviral drugs have been very effective for treating clinical AIDS and for chemoprophylaxis in all parts of the world. However, when drug resistance develops, fewer options may be available for switching to new drug combinations in the developing world. The first drugs available were nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as zidovudine, or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as nevirapine. Such drugs have become less expensive and more readily available in developing countries. However, the drug resistance mutations they elicit are often shared by other drugs of their class. Newer drugs that do not share the same patterns of drug resistance, such as the protease inhibitors, the fusion inhibitors, and the integrase inhibitors, are much more expensive and less likely to be available as back-up regimens for patients who become resistant to the first-line drugs in developing countries. For this reason, monitoring for adherence or compliance during therapy is extremely important, particularly in sites where limited drug regimens and highly experienced therapy specialists may not be available.",

Antibodies directed at the V3 (i.e., 3rd variable region) of the outer envelope glycoprotein (gp120) can be quite effective for neutralizing the virus. However, with rapid mutation and selection, variant viruses that are not neutralized by the same antibodies soon occur in the same individual. This pattern of immunoselection and immune evasion also occurs with immunodominant epitope targets used by the cytolytic T-cell response, and probably represents the single greatest impediment to the development of an effective vaccine. Current approaches to overcoming this problem involve the targeting of immune responses, through immunogen design, to selected conserved regions. These include structural determinants in gp120 that are exposed as conformational epitopes when the virus unfolds to attach to a co-receptor, and cytolytic T-cell epitopes that contain highly conserved residues for virus survival.",
