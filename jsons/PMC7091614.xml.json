Molecular biological investigations have shown three major, mutually exclusive abnormalities in JMML patients, that is, the presence of NF1 gene mutation,4 mutations in the Ras-signalling pathway5 and mutations in the PTPN11 region.6,7 Without treatment, the 10-year survival of JMML is 6%;8 and there are only sporadic definitive responses to chemotherapy.9,10 Allogeneic BMT has been shown to improve outcome: retrospective evaluations of series including 15 patients or more reported an overall survival (OS) of 39\u201358%.2,11,12,13,14,15 Woods10 found a similar OS at 6 years of 31% for 13 patients treated on a prospective study (CCG protocol 2891). The major causes of failure in all series were a high relapse rate and a high transplant-related mortality (TRM). This report describes our single center experience over a 20-year period from June 1980 until January 2001 on 23 children undergoing transplantation for JMML.",

Nine children received nonintensive treatment, for example, with 6-mercaptopurine or low-dose Ara-C, while three children did not receive chemotherapy before transplantation. At the start of the conditioning for BMT, intensively pretreated patients were not different from nonpretreated or nonintensively pretreated patients with regard to age at BMT (split 4 years), hepatomegaly (yes or no), splenomegaly (yes or no/splenectomized), percentage bone marrow blasts (split 5%), cytogenetic abnormalities (yes or no).

The BU, CY and melphalan (Mel) regimen, used from December 1996 onwards, was proposed by Locatelli et al.17 Three patients received the CY/TBI-based regimen in this period because of pre-existent hepatic dysfunction.

No significance was reached for the other variables tested, mainly due to limited power because of small patient numbers.

This observation needs to be confirmed with larger numbers. Intensive chemotherapy given before the start of the conditioning for BMT had a significant adverse effect (P=0.04 in univariate analysis) in our study on the relapse rate after BMT. This finding is not in agreement with the findings of other authors11,14,22 and needs further study. The influence of TBI in the conditioning regimen for JMML was studied by Matthes-Martin et al22 in a single center evaluation of 11 transplants and a review of the literature on single center reports. The relapse rate was significantly higher in patients conditioned with a TBI-containing regimen. In other series,14,15 the outcome was comparable for both types of conditioning. Locatelli et al11 found better EFS of 62% with the non-TBI regimen vs 11% with the TBI regimen for children with JMML given a BMT from an identical sibling or one-antigen-disparate relative. In our series, there is a trend towards a negative influence on EFS of the TBI-containing regimen. These combined data support the inferiority of the TBI regimen, but further study is needed to validate this finding. With regard to donor type, Locatelli et al11 found EFS for all UD transplants of 22% vs EFS of 38% for all transplants with identical sibling or one-antigen mismatched family donors (P<0.05). Our results with transplants from fully matched unrelated donors (n=4) are as good as those from sibling donors, similar to another reported series.14 Smith et al15 found significantly more relapses in using one-Ag mismatched unrelated marrows, but from his study this finding could not be associated with TCD. Using unrelated marrows, which were T-cell depleted because of one-Ag HLA disparity between donor and recipient, was the only factor in both univariate and multivariate analysis with a significant negative effect on EFS in our study. This suggests a possible graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect of allogeneic BMT in this disease. However, the 95% CI is rather large due to small patient numbers.",

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that using one-Ag mismatched T-cell-depleted unrelated donor marrows is associated with inferior outcome.
