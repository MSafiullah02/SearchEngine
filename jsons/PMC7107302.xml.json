The capacity of J774A.1 to internalize HRP was determined, as described previously (Ferrante et al., 2002), by incubating the cells at 37\u00b0C with HRP (1 mg/ml) dissolved in DMEM containing 10% BSA for 80 min according to the method of Noble et al. (1994). Internalization was stopped by transferring the cells to 4\u00b0C and immediately rinsing in ice-cold 0.5% BSA in DMEM, followed by 4 washes of 5 min each in order to minimise non-cell bound HRP. Finally, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% TX-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 1 mM PMSF). The HRP activity was assayed by the TMB method according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

            "text": "It is well known that macrophages play an important role in the mechanisms of host\u2019s immune defense, recognizing patterns on foreign biological substances through the activation of pattern-recognition receptors, such as TLRs (Meli et al., 2014). In particular, macrophages are activated by LPS, the major molecular component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and a potent natural immune stimulator (Fujihara et al., 2003), which was identified as a ligand of TLR4. LPS/TLR4 interaction initiates various signaling pathways leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines, enzymes and chemokines (Rodriguez-Vita and Lawrence, 2010), that collectively ramp up the host\u2019s immune defense. Here, on the basis of transcription timing of pro-inflammatory factors (Huang et al., 2012), we found that NDL-PCBs showed a strong synergistic effects, dampening LPS-induced IL-6, TNF\u03b1,, and MCP-1 gene expression 4 h after challenge. Indeed, PCB 101, the penta-chlorinated congener, was the less immunotoxic among PCB analyzed, whilst both PCB 153 and PCB 180 (hexa-chlorinated and hepta-chlorinated congeners, respectively) significantly suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 expression. PCB 153 also reduced LPS-induced MCP-1 mRNA level and PCB 180, on the other hand, suppressed TNF-\u03b1 expression. These latter results are consistent with those by Hong et al. (2004), showing the ability of other EDCs to reduce or counteract the LPS-induced expression of TNF\u03b1 in macrophage cell line RAW 264.",

Our data clearly demonstrated that macrophages exposed to NDL-PCB mixtures were less able or unable to orchestrate a proper immune response against LPS, since LPS-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression was suppressed by the simultaneous incubation of this cells with PCB combinations and LPS. As known, macrophages have a wide repertoire of chemical signals to communicate with other immunocompetent cells, for example, LPS-stimulated macrophages generate excess NO through the action of iNOS (Zhou et al., 2014). In our experimental conditions, NDL-PCBs, especially in combination, strongly inhibit LPS-induced NO-2 production. Our data are consistent with those by Hong et al. (2004) and Yoshitake et al. (2008), which highlighted the ability of several EDCs to suppress NO production in in vitro LPS-stimulated macrophages, suggesting that they interfere with NO-mediated signaling and host defense system against foreign pathogens.",

            "text": "Since the activation of NF-\u03baB is essential for the induction of inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and mediators, we investigated the effects of NDL-PCBs on this pathway. We showed that NDL-PCBs alone did not significantly modify LPS-induced degradation of cytosolic I\u03baB-\u03b1 and the expression of nuclear p65 NF-\u03baB, while all the examined PCB combinations reverted the effects on NF-\u03baB activation on J774A.1. The reduction of NF-\u03baB activation was also determined in primary macrophages (data not shown). Therefore, all these data suggest that PCBs mixture exposure suppress the production of inflammatory enzymes by modulating their expression at transcriptional level. Other researchers, in agreement with our data, demonstrated that other EDCs inhibit bacteria-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, highlighting their potential to exacerbate infectious diseases (Igarashi et al., 2006; Ohnishi et al., 2008). Moreover, we also investigated whether the immune suppressive effects exerted by PCBs could involve transcription level of TLR4, which is the main target of LPS. Our results showed that NDL-PCBs, especially in combinations, inhibited the LPS-induced TLR4 expression, and conceivably the activation of NF-\u03baB. These data were strengthened by the parallel reduction of CD14 expression which is reported to be necessary not only for LPS recognition, but also for TLR4 signal transduction (Zanoni and Granucci, 2013). Nevertheless, CD14-deficient mice are highly resistant to LPS-induced shock and monocytes derived from CD14-deficient mice are insensitive to LPS as determined by a decrease in IL-6 production, suggesting the essential role for CD14 in binding to LPS (Haziot et al., 1996).",

Epidemiological and toxicological data on PCBs exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurrence were reviewed by Kramer et al. (2012), addressing the role on immune dysregulation. In particular, the authors highlight the impairment of immune cells in identifying foreign antigens, limiting the early cytokine and chemokine production and signaling, that initiate an effective and complete immune response. Our study demonstrates that all PCBs alone and their combinations decrease endocytosis. In macrophages HRP is taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis (Steinman and Cohn, 1972), involving the uptake of macromolecules from extracellular fluid into membrane-bound endocytic vesicles (Silverstein et al., 1977). Neither membrane receptors nor cell surface adsorption appear to be implicated in this process and as a result, uptake is concentration dependent. In our experiments the internalization of HRP is clearly modified by cell exposure to PCBs, causing a reduction of cell endocytosis capability.",
