On April 29th, after receiving from the WHO information on the recommended primer for nucleic acid detection, the IVDC promptly made comparisons with a variety of seasonal influenza viruses, synthesized the primer sequence needed for detection, and prepared the first-generation nucleic acid detection reagent for the human Influenza A (H1N1) virus\u2014which was distributed to 84 influenza monitoring laboratories across the country on the night of April 30th. And on May 1st, the first phase of training on influenza monitoring laboratories focusing on port-based cities began, and immigration inspection and quarantine personnel were trained later on.

Some websites published articles attributing the mid-November Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in Beijing to the vaccination of primary and secondary school students; foreign media also reported the growing distrust the public expressed in the vaccines. According to results of a nationwide questionnaire, the ratio of respondents willing to be vaccinated to those unwilling to do so was at 4:1 in August 2009, which then plummeted to 1:1 in November; meanwhile the rate of respondents unwilling to be vaccinated for safety reasons rose from 15 to 50%. In early December 2009, it was reported that nine children diagnosed with Influenza A (H1N1) in Shenzhen were found to have brain damage, which sparked a public debate as to \u201cwhen to fight the virus and when to get vaccinated.\u201d There were multiple factors to this problem. Firstly, government leaders in some regions expressed suspicion of vaccine safety, and at the same time they worried that too much advertising could cause a vaccine shortage, which would make their vaccination arrangements appear inadequate. Secondly, some provinces didn\u2019t specify targets in their vaccination plans and instead simply distributed vaccines equally, making it difficult for local departments to select targets for the vaccination and hence compounding organization of the program. Thirdly, failure to clarify compensation for local workers engaged in the vaccination program was demotivating and the objective was not conducive to effective promotion of the vaccine. Moreover, media coverage of individual deaths from vaccination, coupled with unfavorable comments from well-known experts on the safety of the vaccines, and some home and foreign manufacturers\u2019 acts of recalling problematic vaccines, produced certain psychological effects on the general public. Risk communication in the early phases of the epidemic mobilized the public and projected confidence in \u201cpreventing, controlling, and curing\u201d the virus, which in turn made the vaccination look unnecessary. Risk communication that followed was so inadequate that the public lost all confidence in the program and some even expressed an \u201canything that is free can\u2019t be good\u201d mentality. Therefore, issues such as how to strengthen public affairs and risk communication, how to stress the pertinence and flexibility of vaccination programs, and how to avoid the awkward situations such as \u201cpeople with access to vaccination don\u2019t want to be vaccinated, and people who want to be vaccinated have no access vaccination,\u201d are all worth further reflection.",

Presently, both national policies that encourage influenza vaccine research and development, and policies on financial compensation to vaccine manufacturers, are flawed in some way or another. Research capacity, development, and vaccine production against new subtypes or new strains are still not up to par, which poses a barrier to the early supply of vaccines against new influenza viruses. Vaccine application strategies and strategies regarding targeted priority groups also need refinement. At the same time, vaccine manufacturers should be encouraged to pursue influenza vaccine development and capacity building as part of their social responsibilities. Departments all over the country need be more active in their vaccine supply efforts. It is important to note the duty of the government at various levels to fund vaccine storage and inoculation which in turn will greatly help less developed regions establish dynamic influenza vaccine storage systems, and help craft reasonable plans for the allocation of influenza vaccines. Surveys found that as of the summer of 2010, that local governments still had roughly 50 million doses of Influenza A (H1N1) vaccines in stock, and some regions and departments saw those unused vaccines as \u201ca loss,\u201d a sentiment that was shared across the board by many others.",

In response, related departments took swift action: On May 11th, i.e. a day after the first case was reported, related departments held a press conference briefing the media about the possible route of transmission of the first case, its diagnosis and treatment, epidemiological survey outcomes, etc. While stressing the importance of self-protection and a reasonable attitude towards the virus, the public was also told that more cases could emerge; meanwhile, experts and related professionals were requested to provide scientific, authoritative, and comprehensive knowledge about disease prevention and control, in an effort to reduce public fear and guide the people to employing rational treatments. Of course, sensationalized reporting from some news sources after early cases began to emerge may also have intensified the public\u2019s uneasiness. This suggests that proper guidance of the media and public opinion is crucial for risk communication.",

At the onset of the epidemic, the MOH in collaboration with the China CDC, organized a risk communication team of experts on epidemiology, emergency disease control, vaccine research and development, and international relations, to ensure the timeliness, authoritativeness, and effectiveness of risk communication. After the epidemic continued for some time, fearing that people had become complacent in their own self-protection, the public was urged now and again to stay alert and employ scientific response actions. On August 31st, 2009, for example, the MOH, joined by related departments, launched an Influenza A (H1N1) Prevention and Control Initiative, which was widely promoted through multiple channels. Its purpose was to boost public awareness, ideas, and actions against the virus, and to ensure continued response efforts from all of society.",

Though Chinese authorities communicated frequently with their Mexican counterparts, misunderstanding still arose in Mexico and elsewhere. In response, related Chinese ministries and embassies made concerted efforts\u2014including multi-party communication and cooperation- to clarify the situation and strengthen cooperation. On July 2nd, 2009, Health Minister Chen Zhu, with his delegation, participated in a high-level meeting on global Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control held in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, at which meeting he profiled China\u2019s epidemic situation and response measures, and garnered support from the participants. Through painstaking efforts, the unfavorable effects caused by suspending Mexican flights were successfully mitigated.",

Therefore, the government and related departments, from the beginning, ensured careful and considerate arrangements were made. Living conditions for foreigners quarantined in China was a top priority, and standards and procedures were formulated to ensure their stay was as comfortable as possible. All related departments properly handled isolation and observation measures in accordance with the law, and provided foreigners with scientific diagnoses, living necessities, and ensured the patients were properly cared for. Meanwhile, strengthening information reporting mechanisms and channels between local foreign affairs departments and related central departments was high on the list of priorities, and related countries were informed at the earliest possible time of their nationals quarantined in China. This was to ensure smooth operations and to minimize possible adverse effects.",

On June 8th, Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, was placed under quarantine in Shanghai after a suspected case was found on his flight.
