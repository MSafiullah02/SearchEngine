The main sources of infection are infected people. The virus is transmitted through droplets and close contact. It is believed that infectivity starts before the symptoms and it significantly decreases 7 days after the onset of symptoms. It is reported that the infectivity period depends on the severity and the stage of the infection of the patient. This virus can survive on nonliving surfaces in 22\u201325 \u00b0C and 40\u201350% relative humidity for up to 5 days and this increases the risk of infection. Aerosol transmission is also possible [2]. In a study, it has been shown that the virus can remain alive in the aerosol for up to 3 h after aerosol generating procedures and could be detected [3]. ",

It is emphasized that the reason for this high rate of infection among HCP stems from shifts that last more than 10 h a day due to the large number of patients and serious staff shortages. Furthermore, excessive fatigue and stress weaken the immune system and therefore, increase the sensitivity to COVID-19. As the infection widened rapidly, it is reported that there has been a rapid decrease in the availability of PPE, and a rapid increase in infection in HCP that resulted in a higher rate of transmission among visitors, personnel, and patients [4].

The order for donning the PPE after performing hand hygiene is gown, mask, goggles, face shield, and gloves; the order for doffing the PPE is gloves, face shield, goggles, gown and mask. The mask should be kept until the HCP leaves the contaminated area. The mask should be properly taken off once the contaminated area is left, furthermore it is important not to neglect hand hygiene once all of these items are removed [11].
