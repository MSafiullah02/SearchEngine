One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. Although g-rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modelled the impact of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. We show that g-rays produce significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induce less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope is sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses. arXiv.org 13.5.2020",

Several companies and research groups report possible success in the development of vaccines or drugs. However, the results of the clinical studies are still pending and it is not certain whether these candidates are safe and/or effective (1). Some of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines developed so far followed the most traditional approaches based on inactivated or live attenuated viruses (2) , as well as subunit vaccines. Traditional chemical inactivation methods can lead to the modification of critical epitopes in both inactivated and subunit vaccines, thereby affecting overall vaccine efficacy (3) . Although live attenuated virus-based vaccines generally induce potent cellular immune response, antibody production is often less efficient, and the use of attenuated viruses is often not indicated in individuals who are immunosuppressed as a result of disease or therapeutic interventions. In the current pandemics, RNA vaccines are emerging as very attractive candidates, due to their ease of manufacture. However, no such vaccine has been approved yet for humans and their true value remains to be proven in the field.",

In this work we performed a comprehensive simulation of ionizing radiation damage to the SARS-CoV-2 using Geant4-DNA (13), a Monte Carlo simulation toolkit which is used for modeling biological damage induced by ionizing radiation at the DNA scale. We developed a Geant4-DNA application to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 structure, and calculated the damage to the virus' spike and membrane proteins, and the viral RNA following exposure to radiation of different quality, that is, low-or high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. High-LET (densely ionizing) radiation is in arXiv.org 13.5.2020 4 fact densely ionizing and may inactivate the virus with less membrane damage than low-LET (sparsely ionizing) radiation.",

Photon cross sections are low in comparison with charged particles and a large number of photon tracks cross the virus volume without interaction, therefore considering the number of primary photons for normalization would be misleading in this comparison. The first bin of the distribution, showing the probability that no damage is induced, is highest for gelectrons, with a probability of ~90% (that is, the probability of at least one RNA damage event is only 10%). For Fe-ions the damage probability is almost 75%, and it becomes 99.8% if only ion traversals though the nuclear envelope are considered.",

The electron energy of 200 keV was selected since that electron beam studied experimentally as an alternative to grays for vaccine production (29) . A second electron energy of 2 keV was also selected based on the results of the recent Monte Carlo study by Feng et al. (30) that shows that at this energy there is a maximum efficiency in virus sterilization by electrons. We found a decreasing damage ratio with increasing LET, and the minimum value, ~0.5, is obtained using a-particles and iron ions. The ratio for g-rays and 200 keV eis ~8-9. The high ratio obtained for conventional g-rays is due to a low average value of the RNA damage distribution. The estimated survival curves were calculated considering that a single RNA single-strand break is sufficient to inactivate the virus, as it cannot be repaired and will result in an interrupted amino acids chain. Thus, the probability of inducing at least one RNA damage was used in an exponential survival model. Figure 3 (right) shows the SARS-CoV-2 survival probability as a function of the dose for sparsely and densely ionizing particles. As expected, high-LET radiation requires a much arXiv.org 13.5.2020 8 higher dose to inactivate the virus because the dose is proportional to the LET and the particle fluence must remain high enough to hit all the targets.",

Here, we show that using densely ionizing charged particles, such as accelerated heavy ions or a-particles, the ratio of protein/RNA damage is reduced by more than an order of magnitude (Figure 3) . Charged particles can, therefore, represent a powerful tool for developing SARS-CoV-2 (or other viruses) vaccines based on inactivated virus, which is still one of the strategies currently used for pandemics.",

The Livermore models (19, 41) were used to simulate gamma interactions. Processes included for protons and alpha particles were nuclear scattering, electronic excitation, ionization, and charge transfer. For electrons, elastic scattering, electronic excitation, ionization, vibrational and rotational excitations, and electron attachment were considered. Electrons were followed down to 2 eV, below this energy an electron is stopped and its remaining kinetic energy is locally deposited. Heavy ions interactions consisted only of ionization which was simulated using the relativistic Rudd model with an effective charge scaling as described in (42) and previously used for carbon ion fragments (43) .",

The incident energies ranged between 1 eV and 30 eV (45) (46) (47) (48) , and damage was induced by energies as low as 3-5 eV. Taking these values into account we determined that an energy deposition above a threshold of 10 eV, positioned on the RNA volume, is considered a damage. arXiv.org 13.5.2020 12 For spike proteins, if the sum of energy depositions inside one protein was higher than the 10 eV damage energy threshold, we consider the protein as damaged. The number of damaged proteins was counted and normalized to a single RNA damage. As we are looking for the ionizing radiation type that would yield the lowest amount of protein damage per RNA damage to inactivate the virus, this normalization is desirable. In a second stage, in order to verify the influence of the damage threshold on our results, calculations were evaluated for 4 different threshold values, 5 eV, 10 eV, 15 eV and 20 eV.",

Considering that each RNA ionization is a damage event in the absence of repair mechanisms (as happens in mammalian cells), increasing the threshold simply decreases the overall number of RNA damage events. Accounting for the lowest ionization binding energy in Geant4-DNA being 10.73 eV, it is in fact expected that damage ratios increase as the threshold value rises above 10 eV.",
