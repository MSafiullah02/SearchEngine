This fungus invades the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, mucosa, liver, spleen and various other organs of humans and dogs. In humans, the disease is characterized by two clinical forms: the acute or juvenile form (AF) and more frequently chronic or adult form (CF). The AF is prevalent in children and young people and presents a more severe and rapid clinical evolution with the involvement of multiple organs and adenomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, digestive disorders, osteo-articular involvement and muco-cutaneous lesions. The CF occurs mainly in adult males and has multiple forms, ranging from benign and localized (unifocal) to severe and disseminated (multifocal) disease that involves skin, mucous membranes, pulmonary and lymph node manifestations (Restrepo 1985; Franco 1987; Kwon-Chung and Bennett 1992; Brummer et al. 1993; Ono et al. 2003; Ricci et al. 2004).",
