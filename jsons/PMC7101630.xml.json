In most cases, simple hepatic cysts follow a benign course so they are usually incidental findings. It\u2019s more often to find these lesions in women that in men, among which they can also be more frequently symptomatic [3]. Presentations occur most frequently in the fifth decade [4]. Usually, they are congenital due to an abnormal and excessive intrahepatic bile ducts developed during embryogenesis. These ducts can be obstructed or have no connection with extrahepatic ducts. The cysts are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium and thin underlying rim of fibrous stroma. They contain clear fluid with water and electrolyte content similar to the serum [5]. Simple cysts are often single, but multiple cysts are also known to occur. Every cyst is nonloculated. Early estimates of the incidence were generated from autopsy studies (0.14\u20130.53 %) [6\u20138], but with the modern techniques, simple cysts are now detected in 2.5\u20135 % of the population [9\u201311]. Only 15\u201316 % of these lesions are symptomatic [10, 12].",

Moreover, it\u2019s necessary to exclude hemorrhage, biliary communication, and secondary carcinoma in the cyst. Laboratory findings are usually normal, but in a minority of patients, it can be found a raised serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (gGT). Also, cancer antigen 19.9 (CA 19.9) may be elevated for its expression in the simple cyst inner epithelial lining so it is not helpful in the differential diagnosis of intracystic hemorrhage [15\u201320]. The diagnosis of a simple cyst is based on the following ultrasonographic criteria: it has to be anechoic, unseptate, with a sharp smooth border, with a strong posterior wall echo, and spherical or oval shaped with a relative accentuation of echoes beyond the cyst [21]. USG has a reported sensitivity and specificity of 90 % [22], and it\u2019s not accompanied with a radiation load, and it\u2019s non-invasive and cost-effective. At the CT, it appears as a defined homogeneous hypodense lesion, while at the MRI, it has a low signal intensity in the T1-weighted sequences and a high signal intensity, that does not enhance after contrast injection, in the T2 weighted sequences [23, 24]. CT can be useful to localize the cyst, identify the amount of liver tissue around the cyst and its position in relation to other nearby structures if it is essential to decide an appropriate treatment when necessary [25]. In the presence of intracystic bleeding, MRI is considered instead to be more specific compared to USG and CT [26]. Because of the radiation load of the CT and of the significantly higher cost of both the techniques, ultrasound remains to be the better imaging modality for diagnosing simple cysts that does not need an intervention.",

            "text": "It is important to establish if cysts are causing the symptoms. If cysts are asymptomatic, conservative management is appropriate. This expectant approach is based on the observation. Conventional management used to be either aspiration or open surgery but while aspiration is followed by a high recurrence rate [27], surgical intervention can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The aims of therapy are to excise or obliterate the cyst completely or partially and to prevent recurrence. In case of doubt, a trial aspiration in order to assess the relief of symptoms can be attempted [25]. Sclerotherapy with alcohol after aspiration has been employed with success, and, more recently, minocycline hydrochloride has been effectively used. Prior to alcohol sclerosis, it\u2019s necessary to rule out biliary communication and malignancy. The cyst is completely emptied by a pigtail catheter, and a pre procedure injection of a contrast agent is used to exclude communications. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is useful in cases where the aspirate is bile stained. Then, a volume of alcohol equal to 25 % of the drained fluid is instilled into the cyst and left for at least 10 min [26, 27]. Alcohol strength is still not standardized. It\u2019s recommended to not exceed more than 100 ml of alcohol at one time, and it may be necessary to repeat the procedure two or more times. Minor complications consist of mild pain, nausea, vomiting, and transient increase in temperature. If severe pain occurs, it can be the result of leakage of alcohol around the catheter [25, 28, 29]. Pain can be avoided by the use of lignocaine into the cyst before instilling alcohol. Minocycline HCl is a cytotoxic agent with an acid PH that is effective in destroying the epithelium at a dose of 100\u2013500 mg diluted in 10 ml of normal saline solution. Mild pain can be experienced as a minor side-effect of this procedure. The solution is left in situ for about 10\u201315 min [30]. The complete surgical excision of the cysts, segmental hepatic resections, and lobectomies lead to a high incidence of complications and death [29, 31]. Laparoscopic fenestration of hepatic cysts has been attempted with satisfactory results. The principle is to deroof the cysts and allow them to drain freely into the peritoneal cavity. The fluid is subsequently reabsorbed because of its composition similar to serum [32]. If a biliary communication is present, cystoenterostomy should be preferred but it\u2019s associated with the risk of ascending infections [33\u201335]. Because of the excellent overall results obtained with laparoscopic unroofing of the simple cysts, this should be considered the procedure of choice for treatment of these lesions [36].",

It suggests that primary cilia may act as a sensor of cell injury, activating a proliferative response to trigger the reparative processes [52]. In fact, PKD1 cystic epithelial cells are more sensitive to the mitogenic effect of growth factors and cAMP in vitro, thanks to Ras and Raf activity [53]. In addition, in patients with ADPKD, the tubular epithelium appears to switch from an absorptive to a secretory phenotype [54]. It is important to subline that the severe form of the disease is only evident in mice in which both PKD alleles are disrupted, while heterozygous PKD mice develop only a few cysts by adulthood. This shows that \u201ctwo hits\u201d are required for development of the cystic phenotype. So, even if ADPKD is phenotypically autosomal dominant, at the cellular level, it is likely to be a \u201cmolecular recessive\u201d disease [55].",

The differential diagnosis of PCLD includes simple liver cysts and liver cysts resulting from other systemic diseases such as ADPKD. Qian and his group have proposed recently ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria that can be used to differentiate simple liver cysts from PCLD. In those who have families with autosomal dominant isolated polycystic livers and <40 years of age, the presence of any liver cysts is considered to be diagnostic of PCLD. Instead, if they are >40 years of age, four or more liver cysts are requested for the diagnosis of PCLD. These criteria, however, need to be further vetted in a larger cohort of PCLD patients [70].",

            "text": "\nAspiration\u2013sclerotherapyAspiration\u2013sclerotherapy is indicated in patients with one or few dominant cyst that are clearly responsible for the complaints. Cysts with a diameter >5 cm are usually good candidates for treatment. The procedure requires radiological aspiration and subsequent injection of a sclerosing agent to destruct the cyst wall and prevent recurrence. Puncture of the cyst is performed with a 5 or 7 French catheter with an aspiration needle. Ethanol is the most commonly used agent, but minocycline and tetracycline are alternatives. These latter agents destroy the cyst wall by creating a low pH within the cyst. The most common complication was abdominal pain caused by peritoneal irritation due to ethanol instillation. The rate of total and partial regression was of 22 % and 19 %, respectively [71]. In the majority of patients, symptoms totally disappeared, or a reduction of symptoms occurred.FenestrationFenestration involves surgical deroofing and excision of superficial large cysts to achieve a reduction in the volume of the liver and has the advantage that multiple cysts can be treated in one session. The best candidates for this treatment are patients having Gigot type I\u2013II livers repeatedly unresponsive to aspiration\u2013sclerotherapy technique. Two types of approaches have been used: open laparotomy and, more recently, laparoscopy. Laparoscopy has the advantage of less morbidity and reduced hospitalization, but this technique is not the best choice in patients with cysts in cranially located segments, as the VII and the VIII and deep-seated cysts. In this situation, conversion to laparotomy is more likely to be successful.Common complications of fenestration are ascites, pleural effusion, arterial or venous bleeding, and biliary leakage [72]. Morbidity rate in these patients was in the range of 23 %. Mortality was 2 %, and the causes of death were irreversible shock, hepatic abscesses, and acute renal failure [71].Segmental hepatic resectionSegmental hepatic resection is indicated in patients with severe Gigot type livers with at least one segment with unaffected liver parenchyma. The procedure is often combined with fenestration of cysts in the remnant segment. Although relief of symptoms is achieved in 86 % of patients, this procedure is associated with considerable morbidity (51 %) and mortality (3 %) [71]. The distortion of the intrahepatic vasculature and biliary tree is a potential source of complications, and the risk of subsequent adhesions might complicate any future liver transplantation. Therefore, we consider this invasive option difficult to pursue in most patients. Resection is considered when fenestration alone is unlikely to significantly reduce liver volume, and when liver transplantation is unwarranted. It is suitable for patients who are significantly incapacitated by their disease and suffer from severe and disabling symptoms due to the massive volume of the polycystic liver.Liver transplantationLiver transplantation is the only curative option and is indicated in patients with type II/III PCLDs refractory to other treatments, with extremely disabling symptoms, seriously reduced quality of life, untreatable complications (for example, portal hypertension), and nutritional compromise [73]. This therapeutic option should be weighed carefully in view of the shortage of available donors, the need for life-long immunosuppression, the fact that PCLDs are not associated with excess liver-related mortality, and that patients typically present with preserved hepatocellular function even in advanced cases. A combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation should be considered in patients with severe polycystic liver and kidney disease who have end-stage renal disease [74].Transcatheter arterial embolizationTranscatheter arterial embolization (TAE) aims to selectively embolize the hepatic artery branches that supply the major liver cysts, leading to shrinkage of the cyst and diminishing the total liver size. Possible embolizing materials for embolization of the hepatic artery branches are coils, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles, gelatin sponge, and glue. Recently, two small case series of patients treated with TAE showed a reduction of total liver volume and intrahepatic cyst volume by 23.4\u201326.0 % and 30.7\u201336.4 %, respectively [75, 76]. However, these studies have limitations due to the small number of patients recruited and the short duration of the follow-up period.Somatostatin analogsThe somatostatin analogs lanreotide and octreotide bind to somatostatin receptors 2, 3, and 5, which are widely expressed not only in many tissues but also in the epithelia that line cysts. These agents reduce intracellular levels of cAMP by activating signaling cascades through the Gi \u03b1 subunit, thereby preventing accumulation of fluid in liver cysts. Several studies have reported the substantial positive effects of somatostatin analogs in decreasing liver and kidney growth in ADPKD and PCLD [77\u201379]. The most common adverse events attributable to somatostatin analog therapy were abdominal cramps and severe steatorrhea. These adverse events disappeared after repeated injections, after administration of pancreatic enzymes, or after reduction of the dose in cases of severe adverse events. Injection granulomas were only reported in patients receiving a somatostatin analog and not in patients on placebo.Pasireotide is a novel multireceptor synthetic somatostatin analog. In contrast to lanreotide and octreotide, it binds with high affinity to all somatostatin receptors except for somatostatin receptor 4. This feature suggest that pasireotide is a promising treatment option for reduction of polycystic liver volumes in patients with PCLDs, especially for those who do not respond to octreotide or lanreotide [80].mTOR inhibitorsAnother medical option that has gained popularity is the use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, sirolimus and everolimus. This class of drugs has strong antiproliferative effects [81], and in a retrospective study in ADPKD patients treated with this immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation, a significant reduction in polycystic liver volume was observed [82]. Prospective clinical trials of sirolimus and everolimus in ADPKD are currently in progress.\n",

The basic structure of hepatocyte is maintained, portal tracts are present, and the system of bile duct is preserved and is represented in its context as the Kupffer cells. The formation of such nodules in cirrhotic liver, however, determines the alteration of lobular architecture due the compression of the surrounding parenchyma and the continuous stimulus proliferative given by the pathogenic agent.Macronodules: low-grade (LGDN) is a nodule well distinguished with respect to the surrounding parenchyma, show low cellular atypia, their vascularization is mainly from portal, even if the portion coming from the hepatic artery is increased slightly.Macronodules: high-grade (HGDN) is considered the real preneoplastic lesion. Microscopically, they are characterized by small size with more cellular atypia, reduced ratio nucleus/cytoplasm, increased nuclear size, prominent nucleolus, increased mitosis, increased cell density, and fatty degeneration. The unique element of the high grade dysplastic forms is the increase in arterial vascularization due to the presence of so-called unpaired arteries or arterioles not accompanied by bile duct and portal vein resulting in the loss of the structure of the liver lobule. The distinction between high-grade dysplastic nodules and early HCC is based on the occurrence in the latter, on the septal and vascular invasion by neoplastic cells nodular.Early HCC: It\u2019s a cancerous lesion <2 cm with all typical cellular atypia [92, 93].In cases in which the differential diagnosis is not possible, the lesions should be considered HCCs and treated as such [94].\n",

Steatosis, clear cells, Mallory bodies, and intra-nodular fibrosis could be useful histological criteria to HCC. The deficit of apoptotic rate as compared to proliferation rate from cirrhosis to LGDN could reflect some dysregulation in the cell population control.

It may be hypothesized that variation in morphology might be related to different evolutive stages of the cell of origin. To support this hypothesis, it has been studied the presence of components of the Notch pathway inside and outside the lesion. Their absence inside the tumor and, in contrast, the expression of Notch2 and HES1 with overrepresented bile ducts might not only explain the lack of bile ducts, but also indicate a more adult phenotype compared with classic pediatric MHL, which show more bile ducts and liver trabeculae embedded in the mesenchymal matrix [105].",

The largest of these studies evaluated the liver biopsies of 64 patients with early primary biliary cirrhosis and found that 43 % of these biopsies had some degree of nodular transformation without fibrosis. Approximately 54 % of the liver biopsies with NRH had evidence for a vascular lesion (decreased portal vein luminal diameter due to intimal fibrosis or thrombotic occlusion [152]). The authors also reported an increased incidence of portal hypertension with splenomegaly and one patient with esophageal varices in this subset of patients with NRH and early primary biliary cirrhosis. In this situation, it was possible that the nodular transformation was contributing to portal hypertension. NRH progresses slowly, and the prognosis reflects the development and progression of portal hypertension. Patients with portal hypertension associated with NRH have a 5-year survival of 90 % and 30-year survival of 55 % [154]. NRH is not thought to be a premalignant condition, and the association between HCC and NRH is unclear.",

The hepatologist should have a high index of suspicion in patients with systemic diseases known to be associated with NRH or in patients who have had an exposure to drugs that have been associated with NRH. Liver biopsy is essential for diagnosis, and at present, the mainstay of treatment is management of the underlying disorder and control of portal hypertension. Understanding the pathophysiology of NRH might elucidate understanding of regenerative nodules in cirrhosis. As understanding of NRH and the mechanisms underlying it are developed, novel treatment strategies are likely to emerge for NRH and possibly other liver diseases as well (Table 1) [156].\n",

The incidence of HCC is increasing in the United States and Europe because of the increased incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [163, 164]. Unlike the liver HCC, benign tumors are less frequent. However, they represent a chapter always more interesting of liver disease; in fact a careful differential diagnosis with the forms of malignant tumor is often required in such a way so as to direct the patient to the correct therapy [156].",
