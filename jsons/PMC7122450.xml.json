Currently, detailed structural information is limited to only a handful of viroporins (vide infra), although these constitute useful templates for the probably hundreds of other unknown viroporins yet to be discovered in reservoir hosts (Anthony et al. 2013).",

Indeed, various specific pathogenic roles of viroporin channel activity have been discovered, and attempts have been made to modulate this channel activity, especially that of influenza A virus M2 (IAV M2, or AM2) protein, the first discovered and the best characterized viroporin. In general, however, the road to rational design and discovery of viroporin small-molecule inhibitors has not been successful [see To et al. (2016) for a recent review]. In fact, amantadine and rimantadine are at present the only licensed antiviral drugs that target a viroporin, i.e., IAV M2. However, most circulating strains of IAV are Amtresistant (Deyde et al. 2007; Hayden and De Jong 2011), and neither drug is currently being used in humans.",

Both intraviral and virus-host interactions, in the form of a myriad of perturbations, can provide important insights into the mechanisms involved in the viral infectious cycle. Also, understanding these PPI networks may aid the design of new antivirals. These strategies depend on both detailed structural and mechanistic information and on the availability of therapeutically relevant targets. In this sense, the initial focused approach to identify viroporin binders is being complemented with genome-wide interactome studies adapted to viral infections using high-throughput technologies, providing a dramatic boost in the search for possible PPIs [see de Chassey et al.

Other Y2H screens have included IAV M2 virus-virus and virus-host interactions (Shapira et al. 2009), or intraviral PPIs in the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (von Brunn et al. 2007). However, this method does not measure interactions between proteins in the context of the infected cell, is biased against membrane proteins, and cannot study protein complexes that are weakly or transiently associated. The bias against membrane proteins can be compensated using the split-ubiquitin-based yeast two-hybrid screen, e.g., in a screen to search for binders of the small hydrophobic (SH) protein of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Li et al. 2015).",

Generally, influenza virions are spherical in shape ranging from 80 to 120 nm in diameter, although filamentous forms may also occur (Lamb and Choppin 1983). The viral envelope contains three transmembrane proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein 2 (M2), on the outside and a layer of matrix protein (M1) just underneath the membrane that contains cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. M1 forms an internal coat that encloses the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), i.e., the negative-strand viral RNA (vRNA) and nucleoprotein (NP), with small amounts of the nuclear export protein (NEP) and three polymerase (3P) proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2) that form the viral RNA polymerase complex (Fields et al. 2013).",

            "text": "The viroporin M2 in IAV is a homotetrameric channel (Sakaguchi et al. 1997). Each M2 monomer is a 97-amino acid protein comprising an N-terminal ectodomain (24 aa), an \u03b1-helical transmembrane domain (TMD, 19 aa), and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain (54 aa) that is a hotspot for interactions with both viral and host proteins during the IAV life cycle. The latter may therefore constitute an attractive drug target for the development of IAV antivirals. M2 has a pH-activated proton channel activity which is required to complete the uncoating process during virus entry. Upon virus internalization via endocytosis, M2 selectively conducts protons from acidified endosomes into the viral interior. This acidification of virion triggers the dissociation of the M1 protein from the vRNP complex, thereby enabling the transport of vRNPs into the nucleus for replication of viral genetic material (Helenius 1992). For some IAV subtypes, the M2 proton channel raises the pH of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to protect the viral HA from premature low-pH conformational change during its transport to the cell surface (Takeuchi and Lamb 1994). The channel activity of IAV M2 has been found to be sufficient for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in influenza-infected cells (Ichinohe et al. 2010). Presently, there are more than ten structures of both wild-type and drug-resistant mutant M2 channels in the Protein Data Bank [see review in Gu et al. (2013)].",

Further work revealed a physical interaction between M1 and the M2 cytoplasmic tail at the site of virus budding, to facilitate virus assembly by promoting the recruitment and packaging of viral proteins and viral genome (McCown and Pekosz 2006; Chen et al. 2008). The cytoplasmic tail of M2 contains an amphipathic \u03b1-helix (residues 45\u201362) (Schnell and Chou 2008) that can modulate membrane curvature in a cholesterol-dependent manner. This feature of M2 has been proposed to be implicated in (i) modification of local membrane curvature during virus budding to provide a stabilized scaffold for M1 polymerization and virus filament formation and (ii) alteration of membrane curvature at the neck of budding virions to facilitate membrane scission and virion release (Rossman and Lamb 2011).",

            "text": "In addition to intraviral interactions, a number of interactions of M2 with host proteins have been described to modulate autophagy, membrane trafficking, host defense, and virus budding. For example, IAV M2 has been reported to arrest autophagy (Gannag\u00e9 et al. 2009; Beale et al. 2014), a cellular degradation pathway mediated by autophagosomes which delivers cytoplasmic materials to the lysosome that is regulated by autophagy-related genes (Atg). This process involves (i) target engulfment by an isolation crescent membrane (phagophore) to form the autophagosome and (ii) autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation of the intra-autophagosomal contents (Fig. 15.1a). IAV subverts this machinery by blocking this fusion, resulting in increased apoptosis of IAV-infected cells. In IAV-infected A549 human lung epithelial cells, M2 coimmunoprecipitates with Atg6/Beclin-1 through interaction with M2 residues 1\u201360 (Gannag\u00e9 et al. 2009). Atg6/Beclin1 is part of a complex that regulates autophagosome generation and degradation and is a common target of other viruses for the subversion of autophagy, e.g., herpesviruses and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [reviewed in M\u00fcnz (2011)].",

In IAV-infected cells, the localization of LC3 changes from the cytoplasm and autophagosomal membranes to the plasma membrane (Beale et al. 2014), a change mediated by a putative LIR motif (residues 91\u201394, FVSI) present in the cytoplasmic tail of M2 (Fig. 15.1b).

Cells infected with a filamentous budding IAV strain carrying mutations in the M2 LIR motif that abolished M2-LC3 interactions produced fewer filaments than cells infected with wild-type IAV, suggesting that hijacking of LC3 by M2 may assist in the delivery of LC3-conjugated membranes to the cell surface to facilitate IAV budding (Beale et al. 2014).",

BST-2 can inhibit the release of a wide range of enveloped viruses by tethering budding virions to the cell surface [reviewed in le Tortorec et al.

However, the role of BST-2 in limiting IAV release has been disputed (Watanabe et al. 2011), perhaps due to IAV strain-specific susceptibility to BST-2 restriction. This interaction was confirmed by orthogonal assays, and using chimeric and truncated M2, the regions involved in BST-2 downregulation were proposed to be within the M2 extracellular and TMDs.",

PB1-F2 is known to induce apoptosis in host immune cells (Chen et al. 2001) via interaction with two mitochondrial proteins, ANT3 and VDAC1, resulting in the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (Varga et al. 2012), although its localization and pro-apoptotic behavior is strain and cell type specific (Varga and Palese 2011). In addition, PB1-F2 from pathogenic strains of IAV can be incorporated into the phagolysosomal compartment to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1\u03b2 secretion and causing severe pathophysiology (McAuley et al. 2013). Also, binding of PB1-F2 of PR8 to MAVS, a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling adaptor anchoring to mitochondria, led to antagonism activity on interferon production (Varga et al. 2012). Despite these data, the precise role of PB1-F2 in modulation of IAV-induced immunopathogenesis is still unknown.",

Coimmunoprecipitation and FRET assays also supported a physical interaction between p7 and NS2 (Popescu et al. 2011), suggesting a complex between p7, NS2, and E2 mediated by transmembrane interactions. These interactions were proposed to be required to localize NS proteins and the core-containing cLDs to sites of virus assembly. Overall, these studies demonstrated that NS2, together with p7 protein, plays a central organizing role in HCV particle assembly by bringing together viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Although the exact mechanism linking nucleocapsid assembly with envelope acquisition is unknown, p7 and NS2 have been proposed to play a critical role in the migration of core protein and E1-E2 heterodimers to the virion assembly site (Vieyres et al. 2014).",

Indeed, HCV acts against the host immune system by downregulating interferon (IFN) production, blocking IFN signaling transduction, and impairing IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. But even when ISGs are expressed, most ISGs have been reported to be ineffective when overexpressed in virus-infected cells due to unknown mechanisms (Schoggins et al. 2011). By constructing a library of mutant HCVs with a 15-nt insertion, p7 was identified as an immune evasion protein that suppresses the antiviral IFN function, forming a complex with the host interferon-inducible protein 6\u201316 (IFI6\u201316) that has been verified by coimmunoprecipitation. It was proposed that while IFI6\u201316 acts to stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential, p7 counteracts by depolarizing the mitochondrial potential, likely through its ion channel activity. Overall, the findings suggest that p7 antagonizes the antiviral responses of IFN by inhibiting the antiviral function of IFI6\u201316.",

While \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs circulate in mammalian hosts, \u03b3-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs mainly infect birds. For example, \u03b2-CoVs include the murine hepatitis virus (MHV), whereas \u03b3-CoVs include the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The first coronavirus was isolated in 1937 (IBV), whereas the first human coronavirus (HCoV) was identified in the 1960s. In humans, disease caused by coronaviruses ranges from mild to really severe, e.g., the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV 3a protein is a 274-amino-acid-long protein with three TMDs and forms homotetrameric complexes that have ion channel activity (Lu et al. 2006). 3a protein has a cysteine-rich domain (residues 127\u2013133) responsible for homo- and hetero-dimerization (Lu et al. 2006). In addition to a Yxx domain and a diacidic domain, it has a C-terminal domain (Tan et al. 2006). The C-terminal domain has RNA-binding activity (Sharma et al. 2007). Protein 3a is suggested to play a structural role in the SARS-CoV life cycle, since it interacts with S, E, and M proteins (Tan et al. 2004) and it is incorporated into newly packaged matured SARS-CoV virions (Shen et al. 2005; Ito et al. 2005). Also, it regulates various cellular responses of host cells, e.g., the upregulation of fibrinogen gene expression (Tan et al. 2005), and the increase of IL-8 and NF-B promoter activities (Kanzawa et al. 2006), possibly through its RNA-binding activity (Sharma et al. 2007). SARS-CoV 3a protein induces caspase-dependent apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro (Wong et al. 2005).",

Von Brunn et al. (von Brunn et al. 2007) reported interactions of E protein with the nonstructural proteins nsp1, nsp8, and nsp11, as well as with the accessory proteins ORF3b, ORF7b, and ORF9b, whereas ORF3a interacted with M and S. However, not all these interactions were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. Overall, however, only 13% of the intraviral SARS interactions known at that time were identified. This is likely due to the bias of Y2H against membrane proteins, which prevents the transfer of expressed prey and/or bait fusion proteins to the nucleus to activate transcription. Pan et al. (Pan et al. 2008) also reported a genome-wide analysis of intraviral PPIs in SARS-CoV replication, using a mammalian two-hybrid system screen, although only two interactions of E and 3a were found here. In comparison with a similar screen in yeast, native posttranslational modifications and folding should be present, but the two methods share a similar limitation in terms of bias against membrane proteins.",

Nsp3 is the largest nonstructural protein of SARS-CoV (1922 amino acids) which is proposed to act as a replication/transcription scaffolding protein (Imbert et al. 2008). Interaction with nsp3 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and was localized to one of the nsp3 seven domains, i.e., the N-terminal acidic domain (nsp3a), that has a ubiquitin-like fold (Serrano et al. 2007).

PALS1 is a tight junction-associated protein and part of a complex that maintains epithelial cell polarity (Fig. 15.6). Alterations of lung epithelia integrity were consistent with E protein hijacking PALS1 to the ERGIC/Golgi region. The E-PALS1 interaction is mediated by (i) a Postsynaptic density protein-95/Discs Large/Zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain present in PALS1 and (ii) the last four C-terminal residues of E protein which represent a putative type II PDZ-binding motif (PBM) (Harris and Lim 2001). PDZ domains are ~80\u201390 amino acids long and typically bind the C-terminal tails of proteins, although internal binding sites have also been reported [reviewed in Ye and Zhang (2013)]. They are usually found in signaling proteins that alter signaling pathways, with over 250 nonredundant PDZ domains being recognized in the human proteome (Wang et al. 2010).",

However, PBMs usually fold as \u03b2-strands (Ye and Zhang 2013), which suggests that a \u03b2-structure conformation may be induced by target binding. Another similar Y2H study that used the same bait described a similar PDZ domain-containing binder, the syndecan-binding protein (syntenin) (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al. 2014). Syntenin is a scaffolding protein that can initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), leading to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The authors showed that the proposed C-terminal PBM in SARS-CoV E protein is a determinant of virulence. Since SARS-CoV-infected patients show an exacerbated inflammatory response that leads to epithelial and endothelial damage, edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the disruption of this pathway may have therapeutic implications. Overall, an involvement of this PBM in E protein in epithelial integrity and inflammatory responses is likely. Several other viruses, e.g., influenza A virus or human papillomavirus, have been described to enhance pathogenesis through viral proteins containing PBMs [reviewed in Javier and Rice (2011)], which probably constitute a common viral strategy.",

In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that coexpression of SARS-CoV E with human epithelial sodium transporter (ENaC) reduced amiloride-sensitive current through PKC activation followed by reduction of ENaC surface levels (Ji et al. 2009). A similar direct or indirect inhibitory effect on other endogenous channels was proposed from patch-clamp experiments using SARS-CoV E-transfected cells (Nieto-Torres et al. 2011). For IBV E, interaction with endogenous channels or SNAREs has been suggested to justify the Golgi complex rearrangement in response to IBV E expression (Ruch and Machamer 2011), although this observation may also involve the IBV E channel itself. For example, ion homeostasis at the Golgi could affect Na+/H+ exchangers that are critical for maintaining low luminal pH. Interactions of viroporins with Golgi channels or transporters are largely unexplored in the viroporins field, but notable cases have been already reported. For example, oncogenic protein E5 from papillomavirus (Wetherill et al. 2012) is able to bind the 16 K subunit of the lumen-acidifying V-ATPase (Goldstein et al. 1991), preventing assembly of the pump and leading to alkalinization of the Golgi lumen (Schapiro et al. 2000).",

This priming involves the expression of inflammasome components, e.g., NLRP3 and inactive procaspase-1 (Elliott and Sutterwala 2015). Various virus-induced damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) induce the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This leads to processing of procaspase-1 into active caspase-1, which in turn cleaves inactive pro-IL-1\u03b2 into the mature form IL-1\u03b2.

The 2B protein in picornaviruses induce NLRP3 cytoplasmic relocalization and inflammasome activation in an intracellular Ca2+-mediated manner (Ito et al. 2012), while a similar mechanism has been proposed for SARS-CoV E (Nieto-Torres et al. 2015).

Another study (Russell et al. 2015) proposed that IL-1\u03b2 is overproduced when SH is absent from RSV. The study also showed attenuation in mice when infected with RSV \u0394SH. That deletion of RSV SH leads to an increase in IL-1\u03b2 is also supported by studies in bovine RSV (bRSV), where a \u0394SH vaccine strain induced higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs of infected cattle (Taylor et al. 2014). Consistent with this, lung macrophages infected with RSV did not lead to increased IL-1\u03b2, although other pro-inflammatory cytokines were overexpressed (Ravi et al. 2013). Overall, it has been proposed (Russell et al. 2015) that SH protein blocks IL-1\u03b2 production, preventing the clearance of infected cells. Indeed, blockade of IL-1\u03b2 prior to infection increased the viral load, supporting the idea that SH might enable immunomodulation. The interaction between SH and G protein has also been shown previously to have an immunomodulatory role (Polack et al. 2005).",

Indeed, in the last few years, one of the leading RSV LAVs have included, among other modifications, a deletion in the SH gene (Karron et al. 2005).

            "text": "Recently, a membrane-based yeast two-hybrid system (MbY2H) was used to identify a cellular binding partner of hRSV SH protein, the B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) (Li et al. 2015), in a human lung cDNA library. BAP31 is a membrane protein located at the ER that has an essential role in sorting newly synthesized membrane proteins. Additionally, BAP31 has a cytoplasmic C-terminus with two coiled coils (Quistgaard et al. 2013), one of them containing a variant of the death effector domain (vDED) flanked by two caspase-8 cleavage sites. This domain is excised upon activation of caspase-8 to produce a fragment p20, known to function as a proapoptotic factor (Breckenridge et al. 2003). This interaction was confirmed using co-transfection, pull-down assay and immunofluorescence colocalization, and also using endogenous BAP31 and was localized to the first N-terminal 44 residues (Li et al. 2015). When 15N\u2013labeled SH protein was titrated with cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of human BAP31, major shifts were observed at residues I6, I8, S12, and W15 (Fig. 15.7b). It can be hypothesized that this interaction could interfere with the interaction between BAP31 and caspase-8, blocking the cleavage sites and preventing conversion to the pro-apoptotic form of BAP31, i.e., p20, thus delaying apoptosis. Incidentally, the viroporin E5 from the high-risk human papillomavirus HPV-16 and HPV-31 was also found to interact with BAP31, where it is similarly thought to regulate apoptosis in addition to its roles in immunomodulation (Regan and Laimins 2008) (see below).",

            "text": "The host CD4 is a cell surface receptor critical for HIV-1 entry into target cells by endocytosis, but its expression at the cell surface prevents the release of infectious virions from infected cells. To counteract this host defense mechanism, viral Vpu, Env, and Nef downmodulate CD4 surface expression [see review in Doms and Trono (2000)]. Vpu interacts with newly synthesized CD4 at the ER to mediate CD4 degradation (Willey et al. 1992). Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 requires physical interaction between the two proteins. In CD4, the interaction domain has been mapped to a specific motif (L414SEKKT419) and a membrane-proximal \u03b1-helix (Bour et al. 1995). For Vpu, residues in both cytoplasmic \u03b1-helices of Vpu experienced chemical shift perturbations upon CD4 binding (Fig. 15.8b) (Singh et al. 2012), although involvement of the TMDs of both proteins has also been suggested (Magad\u00e1n and Bonifacino 2012; Do et al. 2013). However, the scrambling or replacement of the whole Vpu TMD appears to have no effect on Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 (Willey et al. 1994; Schubert et al. 1996), whereas a single amino acid substitution at the TMD, W22 L, abolished CD4 degradation but did not disrupt the CD4-Vpu interaction (Magad\u00e1n and Bonifacino 2012), suggesting that TM interactions between CD4 and Vpu may function beyond the expected role of stabilizing the protein complex for CD4 degradation.",

This binding triggers the recruitment of the host beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (\u03b2-TrCP). A conserved di-phosphoserine motif (D51SGxxS56) located within the loop region that connects the two cytoplasmic \u03b1-helices of Vpu is necessary for this process. Interaction of the phosphoserines in Vpu with the WD boxes of \u03b2-TrCP enables the formation of a CD4-Vpu-\u03b2-TrCP ternary complex (Margottin et al. 1998), bringing CD4 and other components of the SCF\u03b2-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Skp1 and Cullin1) in close proximity to facilitate the trans-ubiquitination of the CD4 cytosolic tail (Binette et al. 2007) on lysine and serine/threonine residues (Magad\u00e1n et al. 2010) and subsequently its transportation to the cytosol for degradation (Fig. 15.8c).",

Accordingly, a C-terminal Trp residue at the Vpu cytoplasmic tail has been reported to contribute to this displacement of cell surface BST-2 (Lewinski et al. 2015). Other proposed mechanisms have been proposed, e.g., Vpu can disrupt intracellular BST-2 trafficking by sequestering both newly synthesized and recycling BST-2 within intracellular compartments such as the TGN (Dub\u00e9 et al. 2010; Hauser et al. 2010). This effectively blocks the resupply of BST-2 to the plasma membrane and thereby reduce BST-2 surface density (Dub\u00e9 et al. 2011). Vpu-mediated BST-2 mistrafficking has been reported to involve the host clathrin-dependent membrane trafficking pathways which are mediated by clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes (Kueck and Neil 2012; Lau et al. 2011). It was proposed that Vpu is able to hijack the clathrin-dependent trafficking machinery via a mimicked canonical acidic di-leucine sorting motif (E59xxxLV64) within its second cytoplasmic \u03b1-helix to recruit the AP complexes, forming a Vpu-BST-2-AP ternary complex (McNatt et al. 2013; Jia et al. 2014; Kueck et al. 2015). In addition, the conserved di-phosphoserine motif (D51SGxxS56) in Vpu may also be required for this recruitment (Kueck et al. 2015).",

Interaction of agnoprotein with the \u03b4 subunit of AP3 (AP3D) appears to hijack the AP3-mediated intracellular vesicular trafficking to prevent the targeted lysosomal degradation of agnoprotein. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the special features of viroporins such as M2 and Vpu, which also manipulate host trafficking pathways. Agnoprotein is then allowed to be translocated to the plasma membrane to act as a viroporin and promote virion release (Suzuki et al. 2013). Alanine substitutions of two basic residues (Arg8 and Lys9) in the N-terminus of agnoprotein disrupt its viroporin activity (Suzuki et al. 2010a) and also disrupt binding to AP3D, ensuing its transport to the lysosomes and subsequent lysosomal degradation (Fig. 15.12) (Suzuki et al. 2013). These basic residues are part of an ordered helical structure (Coric et al. 2017) and may constitute an important regulatory and/or interaction motif.",

Earlier studies reported that NSP4 colocalize with the autophagosome marker LC3 in \u201ccap-like structures\u201d associated with viroplasms (Berkova et al. 2006), sparking interest of whether the host autophagy machinery is manipulated during rotavirus infection. Indeed, NSP4 appears to orchestrate a series of events which ultimately lead to host autophagy. NSP4 viroporin activity at the ER can activate the ER calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which triggers an activation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which in turn facilitates Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane (Hyser et al. 2013). This increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-\u03b2 (CaMKK-\u03b2) to initiate autophagy (Anderson et al. 1999; Crawford et al. 2012). The autophagy membrane trafficking pathway is then hijacked by the virus to transport viral proteins from the ER to viroplasms for assembly of infectious virus (Crawford et al. 2012).",

            "text": "While mechanistic and structural information on membrane insertion and oligomerization of the full-length NSP4 is still lacking, a topology model of NSP4 as a three-pass transmembrane protein has been proposed (Fig. 15.14). In addition, crystal structures have revealed that the NSP4 CCD from two different rotavirus strains can form a tetramer and a pentamer, respectively (Bowman et al. 2000; Chacko et al. 2011) and that the tetrameric NSP4 CCD, but not the pentameric form, can bind Ca2+ at its core. Later studies clarified that the oligomeric status of NSP4 CCD can be regulated by pH and Ca2+; at neutral pH it forms a tetramer that binds Ca2+, but at low pH it forms a pentamer that does not bind Ca2+ (Sastri et al. 2014). While the NSP4 CCD appears to be an interaction hotspot, it remains to be revealed how environmental cues may influence its binding conformations and affinity with interaction partners. For instance, the CCD may act as a cytoplasmic pH/Ca2+ sensor that alters the NSP4 oligomeric state and conformation to regulate its binding to a certain interaction partner, or Ca2+ may even act as a cofactor for binding.",

High-risk HPVs, mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18, are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions. The HPV-16 E5 (16E5), a small hydrophobic oncoprotein, is a recent addition to the viroporin family as it exhibits ion channel activity in vitro (Wetherill et al. 2012). 16E5 is an 83-residue protein with three putative TMDs and an N-terminal luminal, C-terminal cytoplasmic topology (Krawczyk et al. 2010). 16E5 monomers oligomerize as homodimers or hexamers (Kell et al. 1994; Gieswein et al. 2003; Wetherill et al. 2012). 16E5 has roles in cellular transformation, mitogenic signaling, immune evasion, intracellular protein trafficking, and apoptosis [reviewed in M\u00fcller et al.

For instance, 16E5 can help HPV escape from immunesurveillance by downregulating expression of antigen-presenters at the host cell surface. 16E5 binds and retains MHC-I in the ER and Golgi to prevent its trafficking to the cell surface, in an interaction involving two leucine pairs in the first TMD (TM1) of 16E5 and the heavy chain of MHC-I (Ashrafi et al. 2005; Cortese et al. 2010; Ashrafi et al. 2006). The TM1 of 16E5 may also bind and cripple the function of the MHC-I chaperone, Bap31 (Ladasky et al. 2006; Regan and Laimins 2008; Cortese et al. 2010). Intriguingly, a motif consisting of ten identical residues between the 16E5 TM1 and Bap31 TM3 has been discovered (Fig. 15.15) and could represent a case of molecular piracy used by 16E5 to displace Bap31 from MHC-I. In addition, 16E5-mediated ER retention of MHC-I may also involve an interaction with the ER chaperone calnexin, since surface downregulation of MHC-I is not observed in calnexin-deficient cells (Gruener et al. 2007). In the same study, a tri-protein complex of 16E5, MHC-I, and calnexin could be obtained based on a coimmunoprecipitation assay. The 16E5-calnexin interaction also reduced CD1d surface levels by retaining it in the ER and subsequently redirecting it for proteasomal degradation (Miura et al. 2010).",

While the BPV-1 E5 is not a natural ligand of PDGF\u03b2R, it can constitutively activate its receptor tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 15.16, right) (Drummond-Barbosa et al. 1995) and is therefore an oncoprotein that can lead to host cell transformation.",

Deletion of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of PDGF\u03b2R did not prevent its cooperation with E5, demonstrating that E5 activation of PDGF\u03b2R is ligand independent (Drummond-Barbosa et al. 1995). Also, mutagenesis and chimeric studies of PDGF\u03b2R have mapped the binding region to the TMD of the receptor (Cohen et al. 1993; Nappi et al. 2002). The interaction between E5 and PDGF\u03b2R is also highly specific, since cooperation was not observed between E5 and PDGF\u03b1R, a closely related receptor tyrosine kinase (Goldstein et al. 1994). Molecular dynamics experiments have proposed a model of the E5 dimer, where the Gln17 of monomer 1 and the Asp33 of monomer 2 are on the same face of the dimer that interacts with a molecule of PDGF\u03b2R (Surti et al. 1998). NMR studies of E5 peptides in detergent micelles also favor E5 dimerization for complex formation with PDGF\u03b2R through its TMD (King et al. 2011).",

For efficient viral replication, the virus must be resourceful in harnessing or disabling the host cellular machinery. In recent years, the role of viroporins as essential players in viral pathogenesis has been established. However, in addition to disrupting cellular ion homeostasis by their channel activity, viroporins also interact with host factors and coordinate with other viral proteins in structural roles. The structural features of these complexes remain poorly understood. Advances in this field will provide useful insights in the design of new antivirals.",
