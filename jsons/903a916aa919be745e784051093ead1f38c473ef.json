            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century that has been highly transmissible and fatal and was caused by a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The SARS epidemic in 2003 resulted in more than 8400 SARS cases and approximately 800 deaths. Existing in non-identified animal reservoirs, SARS-CoV continues to represent a threat to humans although more than four years have passed since a large outbreak of SARS, and no new cases have been reported. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of reemergence of SARS. It is hence necessary to understand the biology of the SARS-CoV to deal adequately with the next outbreak, whenever it happens. The SARS-CoV is a novel coronavirus with a large (\u223c30 thousand nucleotides) positive-sense, singlestranded RNA containing 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) of which 2 large ORFs constitute the replicase gene which encodes proteins required for viral RNA syntheses. The remaining 12 ORFs encode the 4 structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope; and eight accessory proteins. The viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergoes extensive translational and enzymatic processing to form the 4 structural, 8 accessory and 16 nonstructural proteins. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms or capsid assembly and viral pathogenesis, laboratories around the world have adopted a variety of approaches to answering these trivial questions. It has been our effort to consolidate all information known to date about the molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV into this chapter to update our readership on the current status of research.",

Because this scare of recurrence of SARS looms over mankind, better monitoring of SARS outbreaks through accurate diagnostic tests and the development of effective antiviral therapies are urgently required.

ORFs 1a and 1b encode two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, the latter is predicted to translate through a -1 ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. These two polyproteins are processed by virus-encoded proteinases, to yield 16 individual nonstructural proteins (nsp). Many of the postulated nsp proteins to date have undesignated functions but it is suggested that they participate primarily in viral RNA replication. Most potential gene 1a-1b products are fairly well conserved between SARS-CoV and other CoVs. PL2pro of the SARS virus is responsible for the cleavage of all the N-terminal proteins of gene 1a.

The translation of segment 1b of such a polyprotein is interrupted by the -1 ribosomal frameshifting by a putative \"slippery\" sequence and a corresponding putative pseudoknot structure, which is required for stalling the translating ribosome at the slippery site to undergo -1 translational frameshifting. Two functional domains, the papain-like cysteine proteinase (PL2pro) and the 3C-like cysteine proteinase (3CLpro), were identified experimentally and are considered responsible for the proteolytic processing of the polyprotein into 16 subunits. A 375 amino acid SARS-CoV unique domain was identified upstream of the PL2pro domain, not found in any other known CoVs. In addition, seven more putative regions encoding RNA processing enzymes were identified, namely, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), RNA helicase (HEL), poly (U)-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), 3 -5 exonuclease (ExoN), S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2 -O-methyltransferase (2 -O-MT), adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1 -phosphatase (ADRP), and a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD). The translation of two polyproteins from the ORF 1a and 1b starts the genome expression (FIG. 1) . The polyproteins are then proteolytically processed by PL2pro and 3CLpro into 16 units. PL2pro is responsible for the N-proximal cleavage and 3CLpro is responsible for the C-proximal cleavage. The helicase is then released. ATPase activity and DNA duplex-unwinding activity were demonstrated by purified helicase, indicating that the protein has RNA polymerase activity. 9",

Initial analysis of the 1255a.a. peplomer protein of the virus reveals the possible existence of a signal peptide that would most likely be cleaved between residues 13 and 14. 11, 12 It forms typical petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion and consists of three domains, the external N-terminal domain with its conserved S1 and S2 subdomains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain at the C terminus. S1 is the receptor-binding unit in the N terminus. Molecular modeling of the S1 and S2 subunits of the S glycoprotein suggest that the former unit consists mainly of antiparallel \u2424-sheets with dispersed \u2423 and \u2424 regions, in addition to the three domains identified in the S2 unit. Entry of CoVs into target cells is initiated by binding of the viral S protein to receptor molecules. The S1 domain of SARS-CoV is significantly different from that of other human CoVs, implying that these viruses are using different receptors for host cell entry. The cellular receptor of several group I CoVs are aminopeptidase N and zinc metalloprotease, whereas mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (group II) uses carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules as a cellular receptor. In the case of SARS-CoV, ACE2 was demonstrated to be a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV in-vitro. Syncytia were observed in cell culture expressing ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S1 domain, which could be inhibited using anti-ACE2 antibody. Fine mapping on the N-terminal unit of the S protein indicates that the minimal receptor-binding domain is located between the residues 318-510. 10 Antibodies specific for this S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV S protein were shown to neutralize SARS-CoV infection. The C-type lectin CD209L (also called L-SIGN), a human cellular glycoprotein has been reported to serve as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV. The S protein of SARS-CoV contains 23 putative N-glycosylation sites, among which 12 have been described to be effectively glycosylated. 11, 12 The S protein, when expressed alone, acquires EndoH-resistant complex N-glycans in the Golgi within 30 min following expression. Both high-mannose and complex glycan N-glycoforms have been detected on S trimers within ER and Golgi, respectively, suggesting that trimers form in the ER and pass the quality control to move toward the Golgi to acquire complex N-glycans. It has also been shown that the S glycoprotein is present all along the secretory pathway from the ER to the plasma membrane. 13 Recently, structure of SARS spike protein's receptor-binding domain in complex with its receptor, ACE2 has been determined using X-ray crystallography. The structure though determined at 2.9A, shows potential for usage in designing vaccines against the virus. 14",

The epitope site for TGEV is located around codons 360-382, 19 for MHV it is at 381-405 20 and for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) it is located at 360-409, 21 all at the C terminus. Likewise SARS-CoV, N protein has been found to contain its most antigenic site at the C terminus from codons 371-407. 22 This makes N an excellent candidate for diagnostic purposes.",

            "text": "Being a multipurpose protein, it plays a vital role during virion assembly. The process of virion assembly requires efficient packaging of the viral RNA into the virion. For this, N protein associates with the viral genomic RNA, and together they form the ribonucleoprotein. In MHV it has been shown that N protein does possess RNA-binding activity. 16 The structure of the N terminal (49-178 aa) region of the N protein has been solved by a group at the Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, USA. The structure reveals an RNA-binding domain similar to U1A RNA-binding protein. 23 Studies have also revealed that packaging of SARS RNA into virus-like particles (VLPs) is dependent on N protein. Packaging signal within a domain from nucleotide 19715-20294 of genomic RNA and the N terminal structure of N protein are essential for packaging and RNA-binding activity, respectively. 24 Purified SARS-CoV has been shown to have RNA chaperone activity. 51 Self-association of N protein governs the formation of viral capsid to a large extent and has been observed in many viruses. For SARS-CoV, two groups have shown that N protein does dimerize. The interaction domain responsible for dimerization was first shown to be residing in the C terminal 209 amino acid residues 25 and was further narrowed down to 138 amino acid residues (between 285 and 422) at the C terminus of the protein. 26 N's ability to form oligomers (trimers, tetramers, and hexamers) has been demonstrated to be residing in residues 343-402. 49 N also interacts with the membrane protein. Amino acids 211-254, especially tetrad glutamines ( 240 QQQQ 243 ), are essential for this interaction. 50 Apart from interactions among viral proteins, interactions with the proteins of the host play a major role in the establishment of viral infection. Hence mapping these viral host protein interactions provides vital hints about how infection actually takes place and progresses. It has been shown that N binds tightly to human cyclophilin A (cypA). 27 CypA is a family of proteins that has been extensively studied but their function remains unknown. Recently, cyclophilins have been shown to play an important role in HIV infection. CypA specifically has been shown to play a vital role in viral core disassembly. 28 Hence CypA interaction with N protein may provide new hints about how SARS CoV infects host cells. N protein has also been reported to bind to human cellular heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with high affinity. 29 The regions responsible for this protein-protein interaction have been shown to be residing in the region from amino acid 161-210 of SARS CoV and C terminus amino acid 203-320 of human hnRNP A1. Studies have indicated that hnRNP A1 acts as a global regulator of alternative pre-mRNA splicing and its activities result in inactivation of alternative distal 5 splicing sites and skipping of optional exons. 30 Also a recent publication has demonstrated that the nucleocapsid protein of MHV could interact with hnRNP A1. 31 Hence it may be postulated that interaction of SARS-CoV, N protein with hnRNP A1 may play a role in transcription and replication of viral genome.",

            "text": "Another aspect important for establishing an infection is modulation of host pathways by viral proteins. A report by He et al. in 2003 has shown that N protein activates AP1 signal transduction pathway. However, the mechanism underlying the observation is not known yet. Neither is it known whether N interacts with the components of AP1 directly or through an intermediate. AP1 or activator protein 1 pathway is a regulator of a wide variety of cellular processes. These include cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This makes this pathway an important target for modification by the viral proteins to gain control over the host cell cycle. 32 Moreover, binding of N protein to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex leads to downregulation of S phase gene products, which in turn leads to inhibition of S phase progression. 33 SARS-CoV N protein has also been shown to induce apoptosis in Cos 1 cells. Cells transfected with N protein show significant cell death under conditions of stress, induced by serum starvation. N protein has been found to downregulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but upregulate c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated map kinase (MAPK). Further, p38 MAPK activation was also found to induce actin reorganization. 34 Nucleocapsid protein of several CoVs exhibits cytoplasmic as well as nucleolar localization at some point of time during the infection cycle. In the case of SARS-CoV, the N protein had been predicted to contain as many as eight nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs, both monopartite and bipartite. A report by Zhu et al. 35 showed that the wild-type N was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm. The N-terminal of N, which contains the NLS1 (aa38-44), was localized to the nucleus. The C terminus of N, which contains both NLS2 (aa257-265) and NLS3 (aa369-390), was localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Also the region containing amino acids 226-289 was able to mediate nucleolar localization. Furthermore, deletion of the leucine-rich region (220-LALLLLDRLNRL) resulted in the accumulation of N to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, and when fusing this peptide to enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) localization was cytoplasmic, suggesting that N may act as a shuttle protein. 35 A report by Surjit et al. (2005) provides evidence that N is indeed a nucleocytoplasmic-shuttling protein. 36 N proteins of many CoVs have been shown to be phosphorylated. 37 How-ever, the mechanism by which this happens and the functional significance of this process remains largely unknown. N protein of SARS-CoV has been shown to be a phosphoprotein, which is stable and localizes in the cytoplasm. The phosphorylation takes place at the serine residues and that too by multiple kinases. It has been shown to be a substrate for CDK, glycogen synthase kinase, MAPK, and casein kinase II. A possible mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the N protein has also been elucidated. It has been shown that phosphorylated N is translocated to cytoplasm with the help of 14-3-3 (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein), a protein family that functions as adapters for modulating interactions between components of various cellular signaling and cell-cycle regulatory pathways through phosphorylationdependent protein-protein interactions. 36 It can be postulated that N phosphorylation may be serving an array of purposes ranging from acting as a deciding factor for localization of protein to aiding in creating a more favorable environment for replication of the virus. 36",

The 3a mRNA and 3a protein have been detected in SARS-CoVinfected monkey kidney Vero E6 cells. In addition, the 3a protein has been detected in the lung tissue of a SARS patient. A signal sequence and three transmembrane domains have been predicted when 3a sequence was searched against SMART server. 43 It is a novel SARS-CoV protein that has been shown to be transported efficiently to the cell surface of infected and transfected cells. Its cytoplasmic domain contains sorting signals important for this process. The 3a protein expressed on the cell surface can also undergo endocytosis. It has been shown to interact with M, E, and S proteins suggesting that it may play a role in viral assembly and/or release of virus from infected cells. 44 Also it has been shown to form ion channels in Xenopus oocytes. Formation of a pore in the infected cells may aid in virus release. The modulation of virus release may also be one of the important functions of 3a as reduction in 3a protein expression in SARS-infected FRhK4 cells led to a decrease in virus release. 48 3a has also been shown to upregulate expression of fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells. mRNA levels of all three subunits of fibrinogen A\u2423, B\u2424, and \u2425 were found to be upregulated. As a result of this intracellular levels as well as secretion of fibrinogen were found to increase. 45 In addition, 3a protein has also been shown to be expressed in the lungs and intestinal tissues of SARS patients and that the protein localized to the ER in 3a-transfected monkey kidney Vero E6 cells. In vitro experiments of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation suggested that the 3a protein may trigger apoptosis through a caspase-8-dependent pathway in Vero E6 cells. 46 The ORF 7a or X4",
