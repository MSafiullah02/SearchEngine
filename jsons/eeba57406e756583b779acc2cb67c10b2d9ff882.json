            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in large-scale social distancing, working from home, prohibiting large group gatherings 1 and staying at home. 2 These public health measures have been shown to be effective in the influenza pandemic of 1918 3 and continue to hold a place in today's scenario. Social distancing requires one to maintain a distance of at least 2 meters or 6 feet between individuals in public spaces 4 while stay at home orders require an individual to remain confined to one's home with the provision to leave for essential errands (i.e., groceries, medicine and healthcare). 2 Although these measures are necessary to curb the widespread transmission of respiratory infections disease, their implementation makes the delivery of traditional, center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) (i.e., faceto-face, 12 weeks, 36 sessions) virtually impossible, as CBCR services have been suspended due to their non-essential designation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Essentially, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the participation rate has dropped to virtually 0%. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, CBCR participation in many jurisdictions, including Canada and the United States (US) was already a longstanding concern, with less than a quarter of eligible American patients participating in traditional CR 5 . While many factors are associated with these sobering participation rates, limited access to CBCR is a prominent contributor within the US and other countries. 6 To increase participation, key CR stakeholders (e.g., physicians, allied health professionals, scientists, professional organizations, etc.) have been calling for alternate delivery models to increase access and participation. These trends and limitations in accepted alternate delivery models are issues around the world. 7 For example, a global survey found that the most frequent methods of reimbursement for CR included: Government coverage, paying out of pocket, private insurance companies and shared methods (i.e., between patient and another source), with a portion of the respondents indicating coverage for abbreviated CR services 7 . Considering the unprecedented closure of CBCR programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for covered alternative CR delivery models has never been more important. 8, 9 A recent global survey found most countries have the capacity to implement alternate models of CR. Among all the countries offering CR (n=85), all offered CBCR and 51 offered some alternative model (i.e., home or community based CR). 10 Across the world, different forms of communication (i.e., paper, telephone/mobile, smartphone apps, emails, text messages, internet webpages, webcams and through direct contact) have been utilized with varying frequencies (Supplemental Figures S1-S6, described elsewhere). 10 These methods have been widely used in the delivery of home-based CR (HBCR), but do require the attention and time of service providers to deliver education, counseling and monitoring. During the current COVID crisis, CBCR practitioners are being called in to help care for patients affected by this pandemic, CR programs need to operate in a mindful and efficient manner with limited utilization of man-power. This need to limit manpower and abide by shelter in place and social distancing guidelines highlights the need to upscale effective digital health and telerehabilitation models.",

            "text": "The implementation of HBCR options has served as an invaluable resource for delivering CR to patients facing various barriers that prevent participation in a traditional CBCR program. Evidence suggests that the cost effectiveness of the delivery of CR through telerehabilitation is similar to a centerbased program. 11 The simple implementation of regular telephone calls to interact with an existing member of a CR program has been successfully employed in home-based exercise studies in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart failure (HF) and pulmonary hypertension. 12, 13 Additionally, the creation of social support groups via social media could lead to successful delivery of HBCR by allowing engagement among peers and healthcare professionals and promoting healthy behaviours. 14 It is important to note that the typical HBCR exercise prescription of \u226530 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, 3 to 5 sessions per week 8 will have to be modified during strict stay at home orders for individuals without exercise equipment (i.e., treadmill, stationary bike) who relied on walking/running outside. Instead other forms of physical activity, such as calisthenics, chair-based exercises, resistance and balance exercises should be explored. Furthermore, the use of Yoga in CR could hold potential for use among individuals with CVD to further expand the scope of CR 15 , provided adequate training is provided prior to initiation. 16 Accordingly, for those already in a CR program, HBCR would be a viable option during the COVID-pandemic. 17 If CR programs are able to take measures to implement and master the delivery of HBCR during this time, it is conceivable that CR participation rates might increase once facilities progress to resuming normal CBCR operations by having the option to integrate HBCR within CBCR. The need for implementing the core components of HBCR still requires patient assessment -which poses a challenge to new recruits into CR that requires additional refinement prior to broad clinical implementation. Specifically, the inclusion of new cases into CR will be challenging with respect to assessments, goal setting and prescriptions as per current guidelines 8 considering the need for social distancing. Therefore, keeping in mind the continuous evolution of CR to \"rebrand and reinvigorate\" 18 , we hereby propose \"Technology driven CR\" (TDCR) as a potential model of delivery.",

Nevertheless, in the current pandemic, all these options should be explored to ensure that delivery of CR is sustained and patients with CVD can continue to gain the associated benefits, 22, 23 and potentially get better traction, not just for coronary heart disease but also for eligible patients with HF and peripheral arterial disease.
