Careful analysis of a number of these has also revealed that some genomes contain significant levels of truncated and partial ISs devoid of Tpase genes. These genomic \u2018scars\u2019 represent traces of numerous ancestral transposition events. However, genome annotations are often based simply on the presence of Tpase genes and do not include the entire DNA sequence with the IS ends. Indeed, a significant number of solo IS\u2010related IRs have been identified in various genomes (www\u2010is.biotoul.fr; genome section). Small IS fragments are rarely taken into account even though they can provide important insights into the evolutionary history of the host genome. Not only can this seriously impair studies attempting to provide an overview of the evolutionary influence of TEs on bacterial and archeal genomes, but such fragments may encode truncated proteins and these could influence gene regulation [e.g. (Cordaux et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Shaheen et al., 2010)]. In bacteria (Gueguen et al., 2006) (Stalder et al., 1990) (Salvatore et al., 2001) and eukaryotes (Vos et al., 1993) (Rio, 1991), truncated transposases have been shown to inhibit transposition. One example where annotation of IS fragments has provided important information is in the obligatory intracellular insect endosymbiont, Wolbachia, which also carries high numbers of full\u2010length ISs. The sequence divergence observed suggests that several waves of IS invasion and elimination have occurred over evolutionary time (Cerveau et al., 2011).",

ISs can undergo massive expansion and loss accompanied by gene inactivation and decay, genome rearrangement and genome reduction. Clearly, host lifestyle strongly influences these IS\u2010mediated effects on genome structure, presumably by determining the level of genetic isolation of the microbial population. Factors affecting this include: whether the bacteria are ectosymbionts, primary endosymbionts having long evolutionary histories with their hosts, or secondary endosymbionts with more recent associations; whether they are transmitted in a strictly vertical manner or pass through a step of horizontal transfer via reinfection or passage through a second host vector (Bordenstein & Reznikoff, 2005; Moya et al., 2008).",

            "text": "One view is that IS expansion is an early step in this genome reduction process (Moran & Plague, 2004; Touchon & Rocha, 2007; Gil et al., 2008; Plague et al., 2008) (Fig. 2). This results from a decrease in strength and efficacy of purifying selection due to the shift from free to intracellular lifestyles (Moran & Plague, 2004). It is reinforced by a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet, which leads to the irreversible accumulation of mutations in a confined intracellular environment (Moran, 1996; Andersson & Kurland, 1998; Silva et al., 2003). In the nutritionally rich environment of the host, many genes of free\u2010living bacteria are inessential. Enhanced genetic drift would allow fixation of slightly deleterious mutations in the population, facilitated by the occurrence of successive population bottlenecks. The more genetically isolated the bacterial population, the more acute would be the effect. Indeed, many examples of this can be found among intracellular endosymbionts. This initial stage of transition from free\u2010living to host\u2010dependence would therefore result in the accumulation of pseudogenes, which will eventually be eliminated by so\u2010called deletional bias (Mira et al., 2001). Clearly, the activities of MGEs, and of ISs in particular, make them important instruments in these processes. IS expansion would contribute to pseudogenisation by IS\u2010mediated intrachromosomal recombination and genome reduction (Andersson & Andersson, 1999; Lawrence et al., 2001; Mira et al., 2001) by their capacities to generate deletions (Mahillon & Chandler, 1998). Such deletions would also eventually lead to complete or partial elimination of the ISs themselves. These processes are shown schematically in Fig. 2.",

But IS expansion identified from sequenced genomes has been implicated in generating the present day Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertusis, Yersinia pestis, Enterococcus faecium, Mycobacterium ulcerans and many others. In at least some of these cases, it has been argued that large\u2010scale genome rearrangements and deletions associated with IS expansion have improved the ability of the bacterium to combat host defences for example by changing surface antigens and regulatory circuitry (Parkhill & Thomson, 2003). This has been particularly well documented in the Bordetellae (Parkhill et al., 2003; Preston et al., 2004).",

However, evidence has been presented that they have been subjected to several waves of invasion and elimination of ISs (Cerveau et al., 2011). This may be related to the fact that they are not strictly transmitted vertically but may also undergo relatively low levels of horizontal transmission and coinfection. Other symbionts or host\u2010restricted bacteria also contain high IS loads. These include organisms such as Orientia tsutsugamushi, various Rickettsia, Sodalis glossinidius, Amoebophilus asiaticus 5a2, the \u03b31 symbiont of the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis, the Bacteroidete Cardinium hertigii, a symbiont of the parasitic wasp Encarsia pergandiella, and the primary symbionts of grain weevils. These obligate intracellular bacteria may carry intercellular MGEs such as phage (Hsia et al., 2000; Read et al., 2000) and conjugative elements (Blanc et al., 2007) capable of acting as IS vectors and motors of horizontal gene transfer. Similar arguments might be used for other niche\u2010restricted prokaryotes to explain increased IS loads found in some extremophiles (e.g. Sulfolobus solfataricus and certain cyanobacteria) (Brugger et al., 2004; Filee et al., 2007) (Papke et al., 2003; Allewalt et al., 2006).",

This raises the possibility that transposase expression is deregulated in this symbiont system. However, another symbiont, Amoebophilus asiaticus, with a high IS load, shows no evidence of recent transposition activity in spite of extensive IS transcription (Schmitz\u2010Esser et al., 2011). In view of the time scales involved, only a very small but sustained increase in transposition activity might be needed to give rise to the high loads observed. Further exploration of the relationship between IS gene expression and transposition activity is clearly essential to understanding the dynamics of ISs in these and other systems.",

            "text": "The choice of a target DNA can have an important influence on the impact of TE on their host genomes. Initially, it was often assumed that TE show no or perhaps only low sequence specificity in their choice of a target. While this remains approximately true, the enormous increase in available sequences has provided more statistically robust data which have revealed that several TE use rather subtle mechanisms in choosing a target. Inspection of the public databases suggests that IS density is significantly higher in bacterial plasmids than in their host chromosomes and it seems likely that plasmids are major vectors in IS transmission (as well as in transmission of accessory traits such as resistance to antibacterials). Indeed, plasmids, in particular those that use a rolling circle mechanism either for replication or in conjugation, appear to be preferential targets for certain TE. For example, transposon Tn7 has two modes of transposition: in one, a specific sequence within the highly conserved glmS is recognised and insertion occurs next to this essential gene (Craig, 2002); in the second, insertion occurs into replication forks directed by interactions with the \u03b2\u2010clamp (Parks et al., 2009). This results in a strong orientation bias of Tn7 insertions, consistent with insertion into the lagging strand of the replication fork formed during conjugative transfer. Although studies with IS are less advanced, a similar orientation bias was observed with IS903 (Hu & Derbyshire, 1998), suggesting that it too may use the \u03b2\u2010clamp in directing insertions. It seems probable that many other IS use this type of protein\u2013protein interaction.",

These transpose using a strand\u2010specific single\u2010strand intermediate and insertion occurs 3\u2032 to a tetra\u2010 or penta\u2010nucleotide on the lagging strand (Ton\u2010Hoang et al., 2010). Clear vestiges of this specificity can still be detected in a large number of bacterial genomes where the orientation of insertion is strongly correlated with the direction of replication. There are clearly incidences of insertion in the \u2018wrong\u2019 orientation, but many of these may be explained by postinsertion genome rearrangements involving inversions. This would place the \u2018active\u2019 strand of the IS on the lagging rather than on the leading strand. Interestingly, those IS that are not oriented in the \u2018correct\u2019 orientation with respect to replication are almost certainly inactive and unable to transpose further (Ton\u2010Hoang et al., 2010).

They end with imperfect IRs and generate short flanking DRs on insertion (Table 1). The DR length is specific for each IS type. There are clearly several dominant families among the DDE IS group.

A similar situation has also occurred for the IS5 family (Table 1; Fig 1) whose original members are at present distributed over several families and subgroups. Some of these will certainly develop into separate families (P. Siguier, E. Gourbeyre and M. Chandler, unpublished).",

Moreover, in addition to a variety of transfer functions, certain ICEs carry plasmid\u2010related replication genes important in ensuring sufficient stability of the transposition intermediates to enable their subsequent integration (Lee et al., 2010; Guerillot et al., 2013). Indeed, early examples of ICEs (Murphy & Pembroke, 1995) were initially thought to be resistance plasmids and assigned an incompatibility group, incJ.

Although it has yet to be demonstrated that such structures indeed transpose, ISCRs are associated with multiple flanking antibiotic resistance genes. It is thought that these genes are transmitted during the rolling circle type of transposition mechanism postulated to occur in IS91 transposition. This involves an initiation event at one IS end, polarised transfer of the IS strand into a target molecule and termination at the second end (Garcillan\u2010Barcia et al., 2002). Flanking gene acquisition is thought to occur when the termination mechanism fails and rolling circle transposition extends into neighbouring DNA where it may encounter a second surrogate end (Garcillan\u2010Barcia et al., 2002). This type of mobile element may prove to play an important role in the assembly and transmission of multiple antibiotic resistance (Toleman et al., 2006) (Toleman & Walsh, 2011).",

This is known as the transferred strand because the 3\u2032OH is used as a nucleophile in the integration step to attack the target phophodiester bond and complete strand transfer. However, transposition of these ISs occurs via double\u2010strand DNA intermediates and therefore requires processing of the second strand (called the nontransferred strand) to liberate the IS from flanking DNA sequences in the donor molecule. This can occur in several different ways and is also IS family\u2010specific (Turlan & Chandler, 2000; Curcio & Derbyshire, 2003) (Table 1) and serves to reinforce groupings derived from bioinformatics comparison by providing a mechanistic coherence. Thus, for ISs of the IS4 family (IS50, IS10), the initial 3\u2032OH is used to attack the opposite strand forming a transient hairpin bridge at the IS end. This is then cleaved using H2O as a nucleophile to liberate the IS and regenerate the 3\u2032OH on the transferred strand ready for strand transfer and integration. This is known as a cut\u2010and\u2010paste mechanism. Other ISs such as the IS630 family, related to the eukaryote mariner/Tc superfamily, employ a mechanism in which the initial H2O\u2010catalysed cleavage of the nontransferred strand occurs with a small offset of 2 bases into the IS prior to cleavage of the transferred strand (Feng & Colloms, 2007) as do their eukaryotic cousins (Richardson et al., 2009).",

This has been adopted by a significant number of IS families including IS3, IS30, IS110, IS256, ISLre2 and possibly others. IS1 uses this as one of several transposition pathways (Turlan & Chandler, 1995). For IS3 family members, circle formation occurs in an asymmetric manner. One IS end is cleaved to generate the characteristic 3\u2032OH of the transferred strand. This then serves to attack several nucleotides exterior to the second end to generate a single\u2010strand bridge leaving a free 3\u2032OH on the IS flank. The 3\u2032OH can act as a replication primer. IS replication would regenerate an intact copy reconstituting the donor plasmid and produce a double\u2010strand circular DNA intermediate. Due to low basal Tpase levels, this initial step may occur in a stochastic manner. However, formation of the circular intermediate results in the assembly of a transient strong promoter composed of a \u201035 promoter element in the right IS end oriented outwards and a \u201010 promoter element in the left end oriented inwards (Ton\u2010Hoang et al., 1997). This promoter serves to drive transposase synthesis and consequent integration and disassembly of the promoter.

They form obligatory dimers in which the catalytic site is composed of an HUH motif from one monomer and a single Y residue together with the third residue necessary for coordinating the essential divalent metal ion contributed by the second monomer (Ronning et al., 2005). Although the founding family member, IS200, was identified in Salmonella 30 years ago (Lam & Roth, 1983), their activities have only recently been unravelled (Ronning et al., 2005; Ton\u2010Hoang et al., 2005, 2010; Barabas et al., 2008; Guynet et al., 2008, 2009).

As the transposon is \u2018peeled\u2019 from its donor site as a single strand, this mechanism might be called \u2018peel\u2010and\u2010paste\u2019 (B. Ton\u2010Hoang pers. commun.). The target sequence is essential for further transposition (Ton\u2010Hoang et al., 2005). The transposase, TnpA, recognises small, subterminal hairpin structures in a strand\u2010specific manner and catalyses single\u2010strand cleavage at both ends on the \u2018top\u2019 strand. Surprisingly, the left and right cleavage sites are not directly recognised by TnpA. Instead, they form a network of particular base interactions with short \u2018guide\u2019 sequences located 5\u2032 to the TnpA\u2010bound subterminal secondary structures at each end. This network includes both canonical (Watson\u2010Crick) and noncanonical base interactions (Barabas et al., 2008; He et al., 2011) (Hickman et al., 2010a, b). These are also essential to stabilise the nucleoprotein complex, the transpososome, within which the DNA strand cleavages and transfers occur.

They were recognised as relatives of the rolling circle plasmid replication Rep proteins.

Tpases of the related ISCR elements are similar to IS91 transposases but include only a single Y residue.

From a functional point of view, this arrangement facilitates a phenomenon called cotranslational DNA binding in which the protein folds in the course of translation allowing the nascent polypeptide chain to initiate binding directly to the closest IS end. Indeed, for members of a number of IS families, including IS1 (Zerbib et al., 1987), IS3 (Haren et al., 1998), IS30 (Stalder et al., 1990), the isolated DNA\u2010binding domain bind more avidly than the entire protein, suggesting that the C\u2010terminal end may actually inhibit specific binding by the N\u2010terminal domain, possibly by steric masking. Once bound, the N\u2010terminal domain would be insensitive to C\u2010terminal domain masking. Thus, specific Tpase binding would only occur transitorily early during translation providing an attractive explanation for the preferential cis activity (the preference to act on the TE from which the Tpase is expressed) of many Tpases (Duval\u2010Valentin & Chandler, 2011). Both Helix\u2010turn\u2010Helix (HTH) and ZF domains have been implicated as DNA\u2010binding domains (e.g. IS911 (Rousseau et al., 2004); IS1 (Ohta et al., 2004; Ton\u2010Hoang et al., 2004).
