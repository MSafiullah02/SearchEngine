We showed that some monoclonal antibodies directed against aminopeptidase N blocked virus binding and entry into susceptible cells. We also showed that a blocking monoclonal antibody directed against murine CEACAM1a, the receptor for murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus; MHV), inhibits murine coronavirus infection in vitro and in vivo.3, 4 Thus, monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments directed against a receptor for SARS coronavirus could be useful in prevention or treatment of SARS in close contacts of infected individuals.",

Results of our studies2 indicate that high concentrations of ubenimex or actinonin, both small competitive inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of aminopeptidase N, are unable to inhibit infection with human coronavirus strain 229E. Moreover, the enzymatic activity of aminopeptidase N is not needed for its use as a receptor for group 1 coronaviruses.5\n",
