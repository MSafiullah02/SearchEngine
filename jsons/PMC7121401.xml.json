A specific Fc receptor neonate (FcRn) facilitates transfer of the IgG antibodies across the syncytiotrophoblast into the fetal circulation (Kane and Acquah 2009). Due to the high rate of IgG transfer near term, babies have been found to have similar blood levels of infliximab to the mother. By discontinuing this drug 8\u201310 weeks prior to delivery, the baby will likely be born with no or minimal serum levels, thus avoiding immunosuppression in a young infant. Though there are some suggestive data that certolizumab does not cross the placenta as easily as the IgG derived drugs due to the pegylation of the molecules (Clowse 2010).",

By the third month of pregnancy, only the villi near the initial site of implantation have persisted, leading to the formation of the disc-shaped placenta. Although chorioallantoic placenta in humans begins functioning already by the end of the fourth week of pregnancy, this process is completed with the formation of disk-shaped placenta (Sadler 2004). During the first trimester, the human fetus is surrounded by two fluid cavities, i.e., the inner amniotic cavity and the outer extra-embryonic coelomic cavity.",

Antibody responses that depend on Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions may help widen the spectrum and increase the potency of vaccine-induced antibodies (Forthal and Moog 2009). Maternofetal transmission of non-neutralising dengue virus specific antibodies result in the development of hemorrhagic fever of the newborns even in the case of the first infection with a heterotypic virus. The mechanism is the formation of non-neutralised neonatal virus and heterotypic maternal IgG complexes, which will be taken up by endothelial and hematopoetic cells by (virus-AbFc)-Fc\u03b3R pinocytosis. The risk disappears after the 8th month of age of the children, when the maternal IgG disappeared from the circulation of the children (Libraty et al. 2009). This phenomenon has been observed in the case of other Flaviviruses and enteroviruses, too (Ferenczi et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2010b).",

High avidity cross-reactive memory CTL may produce inflammatory cytokines during the course of secondary infection, contributing to the pathogenesis of vascular leak. These cells appear to be subsequently deleted leaving a more serotype-specific memory CTL pool. Antibody-dependent enhancement ADE is neither a sufficient nor an absolutely necessary precondition for the development of severe shock syndrome or hemorrhagic disease.

Vaccination using inactivated virus particles were caused immune enhancement in the case of RSV in contrast to other, for example influenza viruses (Openshaw et al. 2001; Ye et al. 2004). Cytotoxic T-cells, cytokines and interferon induction by Toll-like receptors may potentiate this enhancement (Mobbs et al. 2002; Boukhvalova et al. 2006; Tregoning et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008a, b; Nguyen et al. 2010; Ubol and Halstead 2010). Tumour necrosis factor \u03b21 block of cell-replication enhances RSV-replication (Gibbs et al. 2009). The evidence of the enhancer effect of non-neutralizing antibodies to RSV can be prevented by the treatment of children at increased risk with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against the fusion (F) protein of RSV (Motavizumab and/or Palivizumab). This monoclonal antibodies were not found to cause harmful effects in connection with the preventive treatment of neonates and infants at risk (Martin-Mateos 2007; Nieri et al. 2009; Weisman 2009; Groothuis et al. 2011).

CD4(+)CD25(+) TREG cells are a subset of T lymphocytes with potent immunosuppressive activity that play crucial roles in controlling immunological self tolerance. Evidence suggests that they are augmented in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, suggesting an important role in early placental development. The literature describing TREG cells in SLE is conflicting, but SLE is associated with reduced numbers and functionally defective TREG cells, which may predispose pregnant women with the disease to pregnancy complications. This article discusses the role of TREG cells in SLE and pregnancy, and how these cells may contribute to poor pregnancy outcome in SLE-affected women (Blois et al. 2007; Clark et al. 2005).",

The onset of a subset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) begins with appearance of citrullinated protein antigen (CPA) positivity when tolerance to certain citrullinated proteins/peptides is broken supported by certain HLA-DR haplotypes (HLA-DR04 and HLA-DRB1 in smokers). Local expression of peptidylarginine deiminases and occasional elevation of inflammatory cytokines can be measured (Klareskog et al. 2010). Methotrexate was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing progression to this disease state in anti-CPA-positive patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) whereas no difference between methotrexate and placebo was seen in the ACPA-negative group of patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA; arthritis without arthralgia). The risk of RA was lower in this group without treatment (Ehrenstein et al. 2004; van Dongen et al. 2007). The treatments using therapies \u2013 infliximab (a tumour necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) blocker) and abatacept (T cell costimulation inhibitor; anti-CD80 and anti-CD86) did not result in significant improvement of the ACPA patients with UA (Saleem et al. 2008; Emery et al. 2010). The analysis of myeloid-related proteins (MRP-8/MRP-14) in serum is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of systemic onset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), allowing early differentiation between patients with systemic-onset of JIA and those with other inflammatory diseases. MRP-8/MRP-14 and IL-1\u03b2 represent a novel positive feedback mechanism activating phagocytes via two major signaling pathways of innate immunity (TLR4) during the pathogenesis of systemic-onset of JIA (Frosch et al. 2009). The rheumatoid arthritis was found to be improved during pregnancy probably due to galactosylation of IgG molecules (F\u00f6rger and \u00d8stensen 2010).",

Very high amounts (0.9% of total PBMCs) of DRB1*04 microchimerism in patients with RA were observed. Similarly, DRB1*01 microchimeric DNA was observed in significantly higher quantities in women with RA compared with healthy control subjects. In contrast, there was no difference between women with RA and control subjects when microchimerism for non\u2013RA-associated alleles (HLA\u2013DQB1*02 and DRB1*15/16) was analyzed (Rak et al. 2009). By analogy to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pioneer studies on microchimerism in women with scleroderma proposed direct and indirect recognition mechanisms as underlying reactions of microchimeric cells (Nelson 2002). In GVHD, donor cells invade the recipient, which is not what is observed with microchimerism in patients with RA. However, the presence of DRB1*01 microchimerism (0.03%) and DRB1*04 microchimerism (0.9%) is not negligible, with frequencies among total host PBMCs similar to the frequencies of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, which thus are sufficient to impact the host immune reactions.

The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS) is a disorder of recurrent vascular thrombosis, pregnancy loss and thrombocytopenia, associated with persistently raised levels of anti-phospholipid antibodies (APA). The APA are phospholipids (part of a cell\u2019s membrane) recognized by the body as foreign and antibodies are produced against them. Maternal autoimmune diseases significantly reduce the pregnancy outcome of the women. The most frequent illnesses were antiphospholipid syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome associated with a rheumatic disease (APS/RD), other RD patients, isolated autoantibodies (autoAbs) in the absence of a definite autoimmune disease (aAbs) and reactive arthritis or spondyloarthropathies. Of these patients, 50.6% had previous pregnancy complications with an anamnestic live-birth rate of 43.4%. In these patients, 10.4% of pregnancies resulted in preterm delivery and 10.9% newborns had low weight at delivery. APS/RD patients had the worse outcome: 17.6% resulted in miscarriage, 14.3% resulted in growth restriction and 50% resulted in preterm delivery. This result was mainly due to patients with APS/systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that had the lowest gestational age at delivery (30.8 \u00b1 3.56 weeks) and the lowest newborn weight (Canti et al.2011). Antiphospholipid syndrome was suggested to be the result of antibodies, directed against cardiolipin as a result of antigenic mimicry.

The frequency of juvenile myasthenia gravis with antibodies to the musclespecific kinase (MuSK) varies markedly in different countries. Neonatal myasthenia gravis associated with MuSK antibodies is often a severe and protracted albeit transient disease (B\u00e9hin et al. 2008; Evoli 2010). Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis (MG) is a human model of passively transferring the disease. Although all newborn babies of myasthenic mothers have anti-AChR antibodies at birth (Morel et al. 1988; Tzartos et al. 1990), only a small percentage of them (10\u201315%) express the myasthenic syndrome (Namba et al. 1970). The myasthenic symptoms usually appear a few hours after birth and their average duration is about 3 weeks. Neonatal myasthenia gravis is transiently transferred from the mothers to the newborn. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies result in loss of AChRs and also directly block the function of the remaining AChR molecules, thereby causing a defect in neuromuscular transmission. The majority, though not all, of both myasthenic and non-myasthenic infants were found to have a repertoire of anti-AChR specificities very similar to their mothers. No significant differences were observed between sera from the two groups of mothers. Adequate treatment in mothers can reduce both frequency and severity of neonatal disease. Neonatal disease will recover following IVIg treatment (B\u00e9hin et al. 2008; O\u2019Carroll et al. 2009). The absence of neonatal myasthenia gravis might be caused by the antigenic differences between the fetal and adult enzymes similar to those detected in rats (Hall et al. 1985; Hesselmans et al. 1993). The human fetal acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is present until 33 weeks gestation, when the fetal (\u03b3) subunit is replaced by the adult (\u03b5) subunit. The term \u201cfetal acetylcholine receptor inactivation syndrome\u201d has been proposed for the illness, when other developmental disorders were also caused by the maternal antibodies (Oskoui et al. 2008).",

The antibody nature of the blockade could be confirmed by showing that monovalent Fab fragments were similarly effective as purified immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms are operative in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Transplacentally transferred blocking antibodies may be specifically directed at epitopes of the mature but not the fetal neuromuscular junction (Luijckx et al. 1997; Buchwald et al. 1998, 1999). Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Sydenheim\u2019s chorea are diseases, which were shown to be associated with the immune response after microbial infections. The occurrence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome noted in infants whose mother had harmless autoimmune antibodies during pregnancy (Buchwald et al. 1999; Sladky 2004). The syndrome\u2019s occurrence within families is also of interest. The MMP9 C(-1562)T and TNFA C(-863)A SNP were associated with severe weakness and poor outcome, indicating that these SNPs may be one of the factors predisposing to a severe form of GBS (Geleijns et al. 2007).",

A recent review reported that BA may involve a primary perinatal hepatobiliary reoviral or rotaviral infection and a secondary autoimmune-mediated bile duct injury (Mack 2007). The maternal virus infections followed by maternofoetal microchimerism seems to be a very impressive explanation of the etiology (Muraji et al. 2008). In a mouse model, oral vaccination before mating with RotaTeq and Rotarix prevented most Rhesus Rotavirus-induced BA (Turowski et al. 2010). Biliary atresia is probably the end-result of different aetiological factors, among which viruses and other agents may cross the placenta. Otherwise it cannot be understand, why only one of the twins obtain the disease (Morris et al. 1977). The anti-idiotypes transcytosed by different efficiency into the circulation of the twins, might be an additional explanation for the asymmetric disease.",

Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thromocytopenia (FMAIT) results from transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies that develop in response to alloimmunization against paternal human platelet antigens (HPAs) expressed on fetal platelets. This thrombocyte loss could be prevented using modified IgG molecules (Ghevaert et al. 2008). At present seven biallelic human platelet antigen (HPA) systems have been determined and can be typed using genomic DNA. Platelet genotyping is a valuable tool in confirming platelet antigen specificities of alloantibodies detected in patients\u2019 sera to complement the clinical history in the diagnosis of alloimmune platelet disorders such as fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT). Prenatal platelet typing of the fetus in suspected cases of FNAIT became also available (Curtis 2008). Half of the infants were borne with low platelet counts and 6 of 16 required replacement therapy upon birth (Ozkan et al. 2010; Gasim 2011). The maternal, transplacental IgG binding to the fetal platelets was suggested to prevent their recirculation by Fc\u03b3R binding to and phagocytosis by macrophages. The pathogenesis of immune trompcytopenic purpura and that associated to myelodysplasia and leukemia were shown to be different (Psaila and Bussel 2008; Psaila et al. 2011).",

IL-17 is upregulated in patients with both types of IBD. IL-6 levels are elevated markedly in the serum of patients with IBD, decrease with treatment of inflammation and are predictive of IBD relapse. Microbial pattern-recognition receptors, such as the TLRs and NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization domain 2), which activate NF-kB, have been implicated in these conditions.

Immunoadhesins (or immunoglobulin fusion proteins) are antibody-like molecules resulting from the fusion of a constant region (e.g., Fc portion) of an immunoglobulin and the ligand-binding region of a receptor or an adhesive molecule. Antibody fragments such as Fab, scFv, diabodies, and minibodies are molecules devoid of part or whole of the Fc portion. Therefore, they have faster clearance and better tissue/tumor penetration than whole immunoglobulins and they will perform better than whole IgGs in conditions where a short half-life is desirable, such as in radio-imaging and/or radio-therapy. They have no ADCC and CDC triggering activity. The smallest proteins retaining antigen binding are a single variable domain antibody (Nieri et al. 2009). IVIg prevention improves the risk of heart block of SLE patients (Friedman et al. 2010).",

Etanercept treatment (25 mg \u00d7 2/week) has been stopped 6 weeks before pregnancy. The treatment had to be reinitiated from the 20th week of pregnancy and no fetal complication was observed (Umeda et al. 2010).

No detectable etanercept was found in the newborn\u2019s blood 12th week after delivery, although the breast milk contained 3.5 ng/mL etanercept (Murashima et al. 2009).

Fatal case of disseminated mycobacterial infection has been reported in an infant who received BCG vaccine at 3 months of age. The mother had been treated with infliximab throughout her pregnancy. Vaccination with live bacteria and viruses should be postponed in infants exposed to infliximab in utero, until serum levels are undetectable which may require more than 6 months (Djokanovic et al. 2011). The fetal concentration of infliximab was found to be higher than that of the mother. This might be a risk for the postnatal development of the immune system (Zelinkova et al. 2011). Due to the high rate of IgG transfer near term, babies have been found to have similar blood levels of infliximab to their mothers (Clowse 2010). All reported pregnancy outcomes under treatment with infliximab showed no increase in miscarriage, prematurity or structural malformations in neonates compared with non-exposed pregnancies (\u00d8stensen et al. 2008). Only the chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody infliximab is currently available worldwide. The potency of this agent in moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD has been one of the most important advances in the care of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the past decade (D\u2019Haens and Daperno 2006).",

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis were the indications (Nieri et al. 2009). CD137 is a costimulatory molecule expressed on a variety of immune cells after activation, including NK cells. CD137 stimulation by specific IgG enhances the antilymphoma activity of anti-CD20 antibodies by enhancing ADCC (Kohrt et al. 2011). Of 153 pregnancies with known outcomes, 90 resulted in live births. Twenty-two infants were born prematurely; with one neonatal death at 6 weeks. Eleven neonates had hematologic abnormalities; none had corresponding infections. Four neonatal infections were reported (fever, bronchiolitis, cytomegalovirus hepatitis, and chorioamnionitis). Two congenital malformations were identified: clubfoot in one twin, and cardiac malformation in a singleton birth. One maternal death from pre-existing autoimmune thrombocytopenia occurred. Women should continue to be counseled to avoid pregnancy for \u226412 months after rituximab exposure; however, inadvertent pregnancy does occasionally occur. Practitioners are encouraged to report complete information to regulatory authorities for all pregnancies with suspected or known exposure to rituximab (Chakravarty et al. 2011). Due to ongoing bleeding, rituximab was given in the 26th week of pregnancy. The platelet count rose to over 100 \u00d7 10(9)/L after 4 weeks. The neonatal B-lymphocyte count normalized at 4 months after delivery. There were no neonatal complications of rituximab therapy (Gall et al. 2010). Passenger lymphocyte syndrome has been described by Lee et al. (2008a, b).",

In contrast, preeclampsia (PE) is marked by an increase in proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) cytokines as well as a decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. In cases of restricted fetal growth, TNF-\u03b1 is also elevated when compared with normal pregnancy (D\u00e1vila et al. 2011). Women living at 3,100 versus 1,600 m in Colorado had higher proinflammatory (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) relative to anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines during the second and third trimesters (Coussons-Read et al. 2002). Multigenerational Andean versus shorter duration European high-altitude residents were found to be protected from altitude-associated fetal growth restriction. Higher IL-1\u03b2 might play a role in protection from altitude-associated reductions in fetal growth (Coussons-Read et al. 2002; D\u00e1vila et al. 2011). Tocilizumab treatment increased serum levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R; Nishimoto et al. 2008). In combination with other drugs adult onset of Still\u2019s disease can be improved using monoclonal antibodies (Efthimiou and Georgy 2006).",

Infections by many viruses, including coronaviruses, elicit potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that can affect the course of infection and help clear the virus; they can also protect an uninfected host exposed to the virus. An improved method for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of human B cells has been developed based on CpG oligonucleotides that increases the B cell immortalization efficiency from 1\u20132% to 30\u2013100%, and this method was used for selection of human Abs specific for SARS CoV proteins. One of the selected antibodies, which was specific for the S glycoprotein on the viral spikes, was about 500-fold more efficient in neutralization than convalescent serum.",

Accordingly, targeting T-cells and/or B-cells with monoclonal antibody therapies ameliorates MS.

The mothers suffering from MS are usually treated with long-term interferon (IFN) beta-therapy in spite of the pregnancy. The foetal exposure to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a therapy before treatment discontinuation was at least 28 days; most pregnancies (199/231; 86.1%) were exposed for \u226445 days. The rates of spontaneous abortion and major congenital anomalies in live births were in line with those observed in the general population (Amato et al. 2010; Sandberg-Wollheim et al. 2011).
