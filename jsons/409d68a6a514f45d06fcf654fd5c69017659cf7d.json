IHPS is known to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but its precise causes and pathophysiology are poorly understood. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts in children with IHPS. Nasopharyngeal fluids, stools, vomit, and surgical pyloric muscle fragments and swabs were tested by cell culture, viral antigen assay and PCR. IHPS was diagnosed in 23 boys and 8 girls with a mean (AESD) age of 42 AE 15 days (range 20-88 days). There was no seasonal pattern of diagnosis. Twenty-two children (71%) lost weight (mean 246 AE 164 g, range 30-600 g) after the onset of vomiting, and five (16.1%) were dehydrated. Seven (22.6%) infants had been exposed to an infectious contact within 15 days before admission, and one on the day of admission (3.2%). Ear, nose and throat samples and pyloric muscle specimens were negative for all the viruses tested. An adenovirus type 3 was recovered from one stool sample, and RT-PCR was positive for an enterovirus on one vomit sample. This study suggests that the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts are not responsible for IHPS.",

The infants most frequently affected are first male children about 6 weeks old [Murtagh et al., 1992; Hernanz-Schulman, 2003 ].

However, to our knowledge, the only microbial pathogens to have been sought in this setting are Helicobacter pylori [Dahshan et al., 2006; Sherwood et al., 2007] and Epstein-Barr virus [Jenson et al., 2001] . H. pylori antigens were not detected by an enzyme immunoassay technique in series of 39 stool specimens from children with IHPS [Sherwood et al., 2007] . A recent study of gastric biopsies from 16 patients showed three cases of chronic active gastritis and six cases of mild focal gastritis [Dahshan et al., 2006] . However, histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining revealed no bacteria, and the urease test was negative in all samples. Jenson et al. [2001] failed to detect EBV in smooth muscle cells from 10 patients with IHPS diagnosed clinically and histopathologically, by means of in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded RNA1 (EBER1).",

The case in which an enterovirus was detected by RT-PCR in a vomit sample which was negative by cell culture could be explained either by a small inoculum or by a non-culturable enterovirus. After oral infection, enteroviruses multiply with the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosae, leading to abundant orofecal excretion of virions. Our case of PCR positivity was therefore probably fortuitous, especially as asymptomatic enterovirus infection is frequent in newborns [Tebruegge and Curtis, 2009 ]. Likewise, detection of an ADV 3 strain in the stools of one of the patients does not by itself suggest a role in IHPS, as ADV can be excreted for very long periods in the stools of newborns with no other signs of infection [Madeley, 1979] . This finding also appears to be incidental, although strains of serotype 3 can cause frequently fatal disseminated disease in previously healthy children [Munoz et al., 1998 ]. Thus, the negative results of all virological investigations of pyloric samples from the patients exclude the involvement of the viruses examined.",
