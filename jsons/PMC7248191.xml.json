            "text": "Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a wide spectrum virus that causes multiple systemic infections, such as acute respiratory disease (ARD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, gastroenteritis, as well as other diseases (Lion 2014; Zhao et al. 2014). Using the whole genome sequence as a means of typing, 103 genotypes are currently recognized and classified into seven species A\u2013G (Seto et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2017). Among the genotypes of HAdV causing ARD, type 3 (HAdV-3) is the most common one reported to WHO (Echavarr\u00eda 2009); it is particularly prevalent among children. Outbreaks of HAdV-3 infections are reported globally and recently, including the United States (Lebeck et al. 2009), Brazil (Pereira et al. 2016), the United Kingdom (Alkhalaf et al. 2015), Korea (Lee et al. 2010), Australia (Harley et al. 2001), Canada (Yeung et al. 2009), Singapore (Coleman et al. 2019), Malaysia (Li et al. 2018), Japan (Fujimoto et al. 2008), and China (Zhang et al. 2006; Tsou et al. 2012; Wo et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2017; Lin et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2019). Despite these widespread and recurring outbreaks, there is no specific drug or vaccine approved for use against HAdV-3 infections.",

Each hexon monomer is encoded by approximately 900 amino acid residues that form a base (Rux et al. 2003), which is relatively sequence-conserved, and three tower domains that occur as loops lying on the exterior surface of the virion (Rux and Burnett 2000). These loops contain several hypervariable regions, noted as HVR1\u2013HVR6 in loop 1 and HVR7 in loop 2 (Cheng et al. 2018), that are noted collectively as the epsilon epitope. This epsilon epitope provokes the host immune system into producing adenovirus serotype-specific antibodies that are highly effective and long-lasting (Rux et al. 2003; Russell et al. 2006; Pichla-Gollon et al. 2007; Radin et al. 2014; Tian et al. 2015).",

On the top of the CsCl, 20 mL of the virus culture was then carefully layered, and the tube was centrifuged at 141,000 \u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h. The virus band was then extracted and transferred to a dialysis bag (MWCO: 14,000 Da) and dialyzed in a buffer at 4 \u00b0C, with two buffer changes, to remove the CsCl (10 mmol/L Tris\u2013Cl pH 8.0, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, and 5% sucrose). Purified virus was titrated by a modified fluorescence-forming unit assay (Philipson 1961). Briefly, AD293 cells were infected with ten-fold diluted rAd3H virus in 96 well-plates. After 48 h of incubation, rAd3H infected cells are directly observed under fluorescent microscopy. Wells with suitable virus dilution were selected for counting the number of fluorescent cells. The virus titer of FFU was calculated as described above.",

However, no green fluorescence was detected in the A549 cells infected by rAd3H which was the culture from the first to the twentieth generations of rAd3H in A549 cells (Fig. 7E\u20137H), which indicated no infectious viral particles produced in A549 cells. PCR amplification of the hexon gene from the virus culture in A549 cells showed no product, which indicated that rAd3H could only replicate in AD293 cells, but not in the A549 cells due to the E1 deletion.

Therefore, apparently the intramuscular immunization was more effective than the intranasal immunization in provoking the immune response.

There is no vaccine currently available for preventing HAdV-3 outbreaks. In fact, the only two vaccines available against HAdVs (types 4 and 7) are not available to the public. In this study, we provide a novel strategy for the construction of a candidate adenovirus type 3 vaccine that may serve as a template for developing similar vaccines for use against other pathogen HAdVs. The time-tested and safe HAdV-5 replication-deficient vaccine vector was used for the construction of this candidate vaccine strain that harbors the immunogenic epitope from human adenovirus type 3 hexon. We demonstrate that the administration of this recombinant and replication-deficient rAd3H strain could elicit the significant increase of neutralizing antibodies against HAdV-3; therefore, it could be considered a candidate vaccine strain to be used for the prevention of HAdV-3 infection or epidemics.",

The genome of human adenoviruses is about 35 kb. Compared with the other methods, the method of homologous recombination in prokaryote cells has the advantages of a simpler protocol, higher recombination efficiency, and easier screening of positive clones. In this study, we used the homologous recombination in E. coli BJ5183 to construct a recombinant adenovirus vector to serve as the basis for a vaccine against a commonly circulating adenoviral respiratory pathogen. This recombinant DNA vector construction protocol consists of two vectors: an adenovirus backbone plasmid, pAdEasy, and a pShuttle plasmid. The pShuttle plasmid contains a multiple cloning site and a kanamycin resistance gene, which support the insertion and maintenance of a foreign gene, as well as provides for the rapid screening for recombination. A PCR-derived product comprising the complete hexon gene (epsilon epitope) of adenovirus type 3 was directly cloned into the multiple cloning site of pShuttle using the EcoR V and Xho I restriction sites. The linearized psAd3H and pAdEasy were transformed into an engineered bacterial strain BJ5183 that was recA proficient and supplied the machinery necessary to execute the recombination event. Homologous recombination was carried out to obtain the vaccine vector bearing the complete HAdV-3 hexon gene. To overcome the undue homologous recombination during the bacterium culture, the recombinant time in BJ5183 was restricted to no more than 8 h, then recombinant bacterial clones were screened by kanamycin resistance. Following the construction of the recombinant plasmid, the putative size of the insert allows for an initial screen, with additional identification, confirmation, and characterization by PCR, REA, DNA sequencing, and other assays.",

The E1 region is essential for the assembly of infectious virus particles, so the replication of rAd3H can only take place in adenovirus packaging cell line like AD293 cells which express the E1 proteins of HAdV-5, while rAd3H cannot replicate in any kind of human cells. Therefore, the safety of rAd3H recombinant adenovirus vaccine is guaranteed.",

In theory, this will guarantee a better immune effect. However, mice immunized with recombinant vaccine rAd3H produced lower neutralizing antibody titers than wild-type HAdV-3 strain. One of the causes may be that the capsid proteins of fiber and penton base in the wild-type viruses also provoke certain immunogenicity (Gahery-Segard et al. 1998; Feng et al. 2018). In rAd3H vaccine strain, no HAdV-3 fiber and penton protein were expressed, while there was in HAdV-3 wild-type strain. Another cause is the rAd3H vaccine strain is replication deficient, which cannot replicate and express proteins well in normal cells. As the result, the induced humoral immunity by the wild-type strain in mice was stronger than replication deficient vaccine strain.",

This potential vaccine candidate had a similar replicative efficacy in AD293 cells as the wild-type HAdV-3 strain. The recombinant is also highly stable and could elicit significant neutralizing antibodies against HAdV-3, with both intranasal and intramuscular inoculation of mice. Therefore, this recombinant adenovirus vaccine is a promising vaccine candidate against HAdV-3. The strategy of using a clinically approved, previously used in gene therapy settings, and replication-defective HAdV-5 vector as the basis of the vaccine provides a novel approach for future development of additional adenovirus vaccine candidates against all of the other adenoviral genotypes causing ARDs and other diseases.",
