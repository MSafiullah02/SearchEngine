            "text": "Background: Rhinovirus-induced early wheezing has been suggested as a new important risk factor for recurrent wheezing. Objective: We sought to investigate the risk factors for recurrent wheezing and to determine post hoc the efficacy of prednisolone in risk groups. Methods: We followed for 1 year 118 children (median age, 1.1 years) who had had their first episode of wheezing and had participated in a trial comparing prednisolone with placebo in hospitalized children. Demographics and laboratory data were obtained at study entry. The follow-up outcome was recurrent wheezing (3 physician-confirmed episodes). Results: Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed in 44 (37%) children. Independent risk factors were age < 1 year, atopy, and maternal asthma. The probability of recurrent wheezing was higher in rhinovirus than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-affected children among placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 5.05; 95% CI, 1.00-25.41). Prednisolone decreased the probability of recurrent wheezing in children with eczema (0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.63) but not in those without eczema (1.89; 95% CI, 0.83-4.29; P 5 .007 for interaction). Prednisolone was associated with less recurrent wheezing in the rhinovirus group (0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.71), but not in the RSV (2.12; 95% CI, 0.46-9.76) or in the RSV/rhinovirus-negative groups (2.03; 95% CI, 0.83-5.00; P 5 .017 for interaction). Conclusion: Rhinovirus-induced early wheezing is a major viral risk factor for recurrent wheezing. Prednisolone may prevent recurrent wheezing in rhinovirus-affected first-time wheezers. The presence of eczema may also influence the response to prednisolone. Clinical implications: A prospective trial is needed to test the hypothesis that prednisolone reduces recurrent wheezing in rhinovirus-affected wheezing children.

            "text": "Acute wheezing affects one third of young children. 1 Half of these children continue to wheeze, at least recurrently, until school age. The risk factors for recurrent wheezing include host, environment, and genetic factors such as male sex, eczema, atopy, rhinitis apart from colds, older siblings, maternal smoking, maternal asthma, and Hispanic ethnic background. 1, 2 Acute wheezing is predominantly related to viral respiratory infection. [2] [3] [4] [5] Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) usually induces wheezing during infancy, and the episodes are followed by recurrent wheezing in 36% to 68% of cases and by school-age asthma in 18% to 37% of cases. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The rates of recurrent wheezing associated with other respiratory viruses are not well known because viral diagnostic tools have not been widely available. Rhinovirus is particularly interesting, because it is the second most common virus, triggering early wheezing in as many as 45% of cases. [3] [4] [5] Recently, rhinovirus-induced early wheezing has been suggested as a new major risk factor, because it has been followed by third-year wheezing in 65% of cases and school-age asthma in 60% of cases. 2, 11 It would be of utmost importance to identify children at high risk for recurrent wheezing and provide them with effective intervention. 13 Although systemic corticosteroids are effective in the management of childhood asthma exacerbations, 14 many efficacy studies of early wheezing have been discouraging. First episodes of RSV-induced wheezing in infants do not respond to systemic corticosteroids at standard doses. [15] [16] [17] [18] Furthermore, only 2 separate reports have also analyzed nonviral factors. 15, 19 In these studies, atopy or systemic eosinophil priming has not been associated with efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in young children . We recently showed that a short course of oral prednisolone reduces recurrences over a 2-month period after the first or second episode of wheezing associated with rhinovirus infection or with above-average blood eosinophils. 20 We report here a 1-year follow-up of children who had their first episode of wheezing. Our aim was to determine risk factors for recurrent wheezing and to assess post hoc the long-term effects of prednisolone on the risk groups.",

Instead, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to identify any risk factors of prognostic significance. In this study, the Cox hazard ratio (HR) indicated the probability of recurrent wheezing. First, we analyzed in separate models the interactions between treatment grouping and each risk factor. Then, we used stepwise multivariable model to identify independent risk factors for recurrent wheezing. We included all risk factors, and those interaction terms were included that showed a potential effect on outcome. We used a backward stepwise procedure in which we eliminated factors or interaction terms one by one according to the highest P value >.05.

Recurrent wheezing was most often related to prematurity (mean 33 gestational weeks) and atopy regardless of treatment. Among the placebo recipients, 61% of children with eczema and 50% of those with rhinovirus infection had recurrent wheezing. The proportions of children with recurrent wheezing seemed to be different among prednisolone recipients and placebo recipients in relation to eczema, maternal asthma, parental smoking, day care attendance, and viral etiology, which indicated a possible interaction between treatment and these risk factors. The separate Cox regression models further suggested an interaction between treatment grouping and eczema (P 5 .006), day care attendance (P 5 .023), and the viral etiology of the first episode of wheezing (P 5 .059). No interaction was identified between treatment grouping and any other risk factor (all P values > .3). The 3 suggestive interactions were included in the multivariable model together with all risk factors listed in Table I . After stepwise elimination, the final model showed that the independent risk factors for recurrent wheezing were young age (<1 year), atopy, and maternal asthma (Table II) . Furthermore, a significant interaction was detected between treatment grouping and eczema status (P 5 .007) as well as between treatment grouping and viral etiology (P 5 .017).",

In our study, 50% of placebo recipients infected by rhinovirus had recurrent wheezing within the first year after the initial episode, compared with 17% of RSV-positive and 46% of RSV/rhinovirus-negative children. This is in agreement with 2 other recent studies that have also used modern viral diagnostics. 2, 11 In a previous Finnish study on early wheezing in hospitalized children (n 5 66), 60% had asthma at school age if rhinovirus-positive, whereas only 18% of RSV-positive cases and 29% of rhinovirus-negative cases developed asthma (odds ratio [OR], 4.1 for rhinovirus-positive compared with rhinovirus-negative cases). 11 A study from the United States followed a birth cohort with an increased risk of allergies or asthma. 2 Of 275 infants, 65% with moderate-to-severe wheezing associated with rhinovirus infection continued to wheeze at the age of 3 years compared with 48% and 49% of infants infected by RSV or other viruses, respectively. The association of wheezing in infancy with persistent wheezing was significantly higher in the rhinovirus group (OR, 10) than in the RSV group (OR, 3.5) and in the RSV/rhinovirus-negative group (OR, 4.6).

            "text": "What is the plausible explanation for the increased tendency of recurrences after rhinovirus-induced wheezing? First, rhinovirus infections can invade the lower airways, increase their inflammatory responses, and enhance airway hyperresponsiveness. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Second, as in the other Finnish wheeze study, rhinovirus etiology and risk factors for recurrences were interrelated in our population. 11 This implies that these patient groups may be connected to other pre-existing immunologic or genetic factors that predispose to recurrent infections or wheezing. 1, 2, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] This suggestion is supported by experimental studies in adults. 34, 35 During rhinovirus infection, subjects with high IgE levels, blood eosinophilia, or increased expired nitric oxide had more severe lower respiratory tract symptoms. Third, age at the first infection may also be critical, because immature immune responses may be modified by environmental factors, such as viral infections. This suggestion derived from a neonatal mouse model agrees with our finding that young age at the first episode of wheezing was associated with an increased risk for recurrent wheezing. 36 Our results on traditional risk factors for recurrent wheezing agree with previous studies. 1, 37 Atopy and maternal asthma are strong predictors of persistent wheezing, whereas prematurity is more likely to be associated with transient wheezing in early life. Both these wheezing phenotypes were represented in our study because the participants were recruited from the general population, not from a specific risk population.",

This finding is in agreement with our previous report of a 2-month follow-up. 20 Contrary to our finding, no disease-modifying effect was seen in 2 recent studies using inhaled corticosteroid therapy either intermittently during wheezing in infants or continuously in children with a positive asthmapredictive index. 38, 39 It is, however, important to note that the study by Guilbert et al 39 included children who had experienced recurrent wheezing episodes, making their population very different from ours. The reasons for the discrepancy between our study and these earlier studies may lie in our systemic administration and higher dosage of corticosteroids.

Therefore, we regarded prednisolone versus placebo treatment as an equal covariate to risk factors such as maternal asthma. Our viral grouping can be criticized, although it is in line with that of the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study. 2 There is no standard for etiologic grouping. In the regression model, we used the RSV group as a reference group because the probability of recurrent wheezing associated with RSV is well known. To avoid multiple testing and consequent false-positive results, we performed interaction tests instead of testing subgroups, for which we provided only estimates with CIs. 41 Although our children had not had previous wheezing requiring outpatient visit or hospitalization, we cannot assure that previous viral infections had not induced lower respiratory symptoms insufficient to result in noticeable wheezing. Prolonged coughing alone can be the dominant symptom under such circumstances.
