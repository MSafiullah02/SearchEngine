Large droplets (>100 \u03bcm) can settle on the ground before they become droplet nuclei [ 1 , 2 ] . Most respiratory droplets are <100 \u03bcm in diameter and evaporate rapidly in the surrounding environment. They become droplet nuclei, which are suspended in the air or are transported away by airfl ow. The size distribution of droplets is a matter of great debate, but in general various particle sizes are generated: large droplets (>20 \u03bcm) that fall directly to the ground or surface; medium-sized particles (5-20 \u03bcm), fall at a slower rate or remain temporarily suspended by air currents and evaporate; to become droplet nuclei (aerosol) particles <5 \u03bcm in diameter, which remain suspended for longer periods of time [ 1 , 2 ] . Studies have demonstrated that particles <10 \u03bcm in diameter are more likely to cause infection in the lower respiratory tract [ 3 , 4 ] . The suspension of these droplet nuclei may cause infection over greater distances and increase the duration of infection risk following generation of the initial respiratory aerosol. In addition, the concentration of particles in the secretion and the infectious dose of the pathogen affect the risk of infection. Droplets in the respirable range (~5 \u03bcm) may play a signifi cant part in transmission. A few studies have quantifi ed the viral load in droplets or aerosols [ 5 ] .",

Infection rates were higher in doctors and nurses carrying out endotracheal intubation [relative risk (RR) 13.29, 95 % confi dence interval (CI) 2.99-54.04, p = 0.03], and nurses caring for SARS patients receiving NIV may have been at increased risk (RR 2.23), but these fi ndings did not reach signifi cance [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.25-21.76, p = 0.5] [ 10 ] . In a case-control study of the dissemination of SARS from an index case to other patients on the same ward, Yu et al. [ 9 ] showed an increased risk associated with the index patient requiring oxygen or bilevel NIV. Case reports [ 11 , 12 ] have also linked transmission of infection to nebulizer use in the index patient. However, patient variables are also important factors to consider: Sicker patients have a higher viral load and are more likely to require oxygen and ventilator support, and those with underlying asthma require nebulizer therapy and cough more because of airway hyperreactivity. Both settings increase the risk of aerosol transmission.",

Three groups of patients were studied: normal control subjects; subjects with coryzal symptoms; adults with chronic lung disease who were admitted with an infective exacerbation. Each group received O 2 , NIV using a vented mask system, and a modifi ed circuit with a nonvented mask and an exhalation fi lter. All received nebulized saline and a period of standardized chest physiotherapy. Droplet counts in mean diameter sizes ranging from 0.3 to >10.0 \u03bcm were measured with a counter placed adjacent to the face and at 1 m distance from the patient at the height of the nose/mouth of an average HCW. NIV using a vented mask produce large droplets (>10 \u03bcm) in patients ( p = 0.042) and coryzal subjects ( p = 0.044) compared with baseline values but not in normal controls ( p = 0.379). This increase in large droplets was not seen using the NIV circuit modifi cation. Chest physiotherapy produced droplets predominantly >10 \u03bcm ( p = 0.003), with the droplet count (as in the NIV patients) falling signifi cantly by 1 m. O 2 did not increase the droplet count in any size range. Nebulized saline delivered droplets in the small and medium size aerosol/droplet range, in keeping with the specifi ed performance characteristics of the device, but did not increase the large-droplet count. Preliminary analyses suggest that droplet counts fall to within a baseline range within 20-40 min of discontinuing the NIV and chest physiotherapy.",

            "text": "Noninvasive ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure are likely to play a minor role in the management of moderate to severe acute lung injury caused by infl uenza or secondary bacterial pneumonia, or in patients with multisystem failure. However, NIV was used successfully in some SARS cases [ 22 ] . There is also potential for NIV to reduce the need for intubation in patients with infl uenza pneumonia or chronic respiratory disease, facilitate extubation, and widen the provision of ventilator support outside the intensive care unit (ICU). It may also be used as ventilator care in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive cardiac failure, and other serious co-morbidities. NIV is sometimes used to palliate symptoms in those with end-stage disease in whom ICU admission is not indicated [ 23 ] . These indications should be set against the risk of droplet dissemination during the delivery of NIV. Despite the study of Simonds et al. [ 20 ] , which indicated that NIV generates large droplets adjacent to the patient that fall significantly at 1 m from the patient, and that adding a circuit using a nonvented mask plus a fi ltered exhalate reduces the number of large droplets produced, there is still concern about dispersion of infectious particles. Nevertheless, in a Hong Kong hospital where more than 20 patients were placed on noninvasive positive ventilation, all HCWs on the ward performed meticulous infection-control procedures and used PPE. Despite the intense exposure, none became infected with SARS [ 24 ] . Patient selection is important for NIV as it has not been shown to improve the mortality rate among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may be not suitable for patients in whom short-term improvement is not expected [ 25 , 26 ] .",

The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidelines that recommend the use of standard, contact, and airborne protection, including respirators of N-95 standard or higher, which fi lter at least 95 % of particles that are \u22651 mm with <10 % face seal air leak. These fi lters not only protect against virus-transmitted diseases but also against tuberculosis (TB), fi ltering at least 95 % of the 3-to 5-mm TB bacilli out of the air inhaled by HCWs. The need for N-95 masks depends on the mode of transmission. If transmission is solely by droplet, face shields, eye protection, and surgical masks are adequate. However, if transmission is airborne, N-95 masks should be used. As reviewed earlier, there is evidence that airborne transmission of SARS occurred, at least from the super-spreaders or during aerosol-generating activities such as intubation or suctioning. Knowing that super-spreaders are identifi ed only in retrospect, it may be prudent for workers to wear N-95 masks at all times.",

Adequate sedation and neuromuscular blockade is recommended during intubation to minimize cough and dispersion of respiratory secretions. Finally, the procedure should be performed by the most experienced person available to minimize the dispersal of infectious particles and reduce the number of individuals exposed during intubation [ 29 ] . Measures to minimize respiratory droplet transmission include using in-line suctioning to maintain the ventilator circuit as a closed system. Humidifi cation should be done via heat-moisture exchangers with viral-bacterial fi lter properties rather than heated humidifi ers. Each ventilator should have two fi lters-one between the inspiratory port and ventilator circuit and the other between the expiratory port and ventilator circuit-to provide additional protection from exhaust gases and minimize ventilator contamination [ 26 ] .",

Hence, the situation where such a ventilation system is used needs to be considered carefully. Even though an ideal isolation unit is fi tted with a negative-pressure system and sliding glass doors (to reduce airfl ow generated by traditional hinged doors), it is possibly the movement of people in and out of the room that produces the most signifi cant airfl ow. Of course, it is impossible to prevent such movement in a health care facility, but reducing the number of times the room is entered or exited can reduce the volume of potentially infected air exchanged across the doorway.",
