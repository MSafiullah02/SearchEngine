Speakers also included topics such as the general signs and symptoms and psychological effects of exposure to selected chemical, biologic, radiologic, nuclear, and explosive agents. After 2 years, the symposium was expanded to include an afternoon hands-on experience. Students were invited to assist at the emergency department (ED) of Woodhull Medical Center during their Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations\u2013required, semi-annual disaster mock drill. (See\nTable 1 for various drill scenarios.) Students were allowed to participate in the virtual MCI, which allowed them to see and experience the relationship between disaster preparedness theory and practice. It gave them the opportunity to utilize and demonstrate critical thinking, assessment, technical and communication skills within a new context. In December 2005, the faculty added an evaluation component to empirically test knowledge transfer by using a newly developed Student Attitudes Toward Disaster Preparedness Questionnaire.",

Most of all, they realize the importance of team play and the pivotal role of the nurse in a disaster. As victims, students experience first-hand how the aforementioned procedures are executed, but more importantly, they are provided the opportunity to live the process of being in a crisis.

If time permits, additional content may include other possible nursing roles in a disaster or MCI: (1) researcher, epidemiologist; (2) first responder; (3) direct care provider; (4) on-site coordinator of care/incident commander; (5) triage officer; (6) information provider/educator; (7) generalist nurse; (8) advanced practice nurse; and (9) mental health counselor.

Through curriculum mapping, we will learn how disaster preparedness and MCI response content builds upon or supports existing content and experiences. The next step, especially if additional content or experiences seem to be required, will be to locate pedagogical techniques best suited to prepare graduates in related competencies.12 We believe that: (1) continuing to focus on the consensus-based competencies included in the INCMCE framework, as well as collaboration with hospitals and like facilities, will help us in educating LIUSON's future practitioners; and (2) empirical evaluation of knowledge gained through the administration of reliable and valid measurement tools not only will provide data but will help respond to the evaluation gap in INCMCE that currently exists. To successfully accomplish the latter, face and content validity must be established for the Student Attitudes Towards Disaster Preparedness Questionnaire by the LIUSON Test Review Committee. Test-retest reliability then can be achieved through subsequent administration of the questionnaire to student participants.",
