South Korea has had a rapid surge in cases of COVID-19 since February 18, most of which were linked to the religious group called Shincheonji [2]. To date, 81% of total Korean cases occurred as clusters of cases [2]. Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are vulnerable to cluster outbreaks. Because patients in LTCHs need continuous intimate cares, it is difficult to find facilities and healthcare personnel for their separate isolation care in a large outbreak situation. Furthermore, they are the risk group if infected. Although several drugs have been proposed as treatment regimens, there are no data on the effectiveness and safety of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19. On February 23, a hospital social worker at a LTCH in Busan was diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending a religious service of Shincheonji 7 days earlier and inpatients and hospital staff were exposed to her. We are sharing our experience of the outbreak response in the LTCH including PEP using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).",

All of the 193 inpatients were considered as exposed to her because she visited every floor of the hospital including intensive care unit (ICU) on surveillance cameras (Fig. 1\n, Supplement Table 1). Five febrile patients were isolated in single-bed rooms. Ten ambulatory patients were sent to a public dormitory for quarantine. Out of 123 hospital staff, 24 heath care personnel (HCP) exposed to the index case were at home quarantine for 2 weeks. Other HCP who had to work were quarantined in a hotel and commuted to the hospital. Through screening of 313 persons for SARS-CoV-2, a 63-year-old careworker (the second case) was found as a COVID-19 case. She did not remember any contact with the index case. On February 25, she had headache and was wearing a facemask while working in ICU from 6 am to noon. 22 of 26 exposed ICU patients were transferred to a designated hospital and 4 were quarantined. 14 HCP exposed to her were quarantined separately.",

In contrast, we had no additional confirmed cases among exposed patients and caregivers. However, it is not sure if PEP was effective because there was no control group. Both chloroquine and HCQ had antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [3], [4], [5], [6]. Clinical data from China and France showed chloroquine was superior to the control treatment, leading to recommend chloroquine in patients with mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia [7], [8], [9], [10]. Although there is currently no approved PEP for people exposed to COVID-19, we initiated PEP with HCQ for the patients and careworkers, considering that our patients were the elderly population who are at risk from adverse outcomes and HCQ was a safe drug widely used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Several different regimens of hydroxychloroquine are recommended to treat COVID-19 patients: 800mg qd, 600mg qd, 200mg tid, and 400mg qd with or without loading doses. No data on regimens for PEP are available. We chose 400mg qd because the patients in LTCH had small bodies with low body weight in order to avoid adverse events. With the same reason, we did not give the initial loading doses. In this study, HCQ was associated with mild adverse events. One patient having skin rash needed steroid for control without discontinuation. PEP was discontinued in 5 patients due to gastrointestinal upset, bradycardia, and for fasting.",
