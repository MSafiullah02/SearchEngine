Natural resources provide cost-effective, accessible and reliable medical substances. For instance, in ancient China, disposed earthworms are relied on as home remedies to treat burns, arthritis, itching and inflammation (Zhenjun et al., 1997). Modern researches also revealed the glycolipoprotein extract from E. fetida, G-90, stimulates cell proliferation and migration promoting wound recovery (Grdisa et al., 2004). Furthermore, accelerated wound healing process was observed in 3-day post-amputated regeneration section of E. fetida (G-90\u2032) compared to G-90 in our previous study (Yang et al., 2017). However, the mechanism contributes to augment therapeutic effect in G-90\u2019 to G-90 on wound repair is not clear. It was hypothesized as up-regulated expression of specific functional proteins in regeneration process of amputated E. fetida. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate up-regulated materials in regenerated earthworm tissue through several analytic methods. The experimental design is presented in Fig. 1\n.",

In addition to functional protein identification, transcriptome analysis was performed to discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3-day regenerated (G-90\u2032) and 0-day regenerated (G-90) tissue homogenate from tail-amputated E. fetida. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a highly sensitive and accurate approach for analysing the whole-transcriptome by using the next generation sequencing technology (Dundar et al., 2014b, 2014a; Yamada et al., 2018). Due to its incomparable advantages in broader dynamic range, not limitation by prior knowledge and compatibility to all species, RNA-Seq is capable of identifying previously undetected genes even without the reference genome sequences (Thunders et al., 2017). In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis in the absence of a reference genome to discover DEGs in regenerated and non-regenerated E. fetida. Identified functional proteins combined with RNA-Seq analysis in G-90 and G-90\u2019, two differentially expressed functional proteins- HSP70 and lysozyme were considered up-regulation after regeneration process. Therefore, their up-regulated expression was validated through semi-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (semi-q PCR) and western blot analysis.",

Sequenced DEGs were translated into proteins through BLAST and annotated by searching in those protein databases. Of the 557 DEGs identified, 337 were annotated between G-90 and G-90\u2019. Proteins annotated in GO, COG and KEGG databases were performed GO enrichment, eggNOG classification and KEGG pathway analyses to investigate biological function of DEGs. As a major bioinformatics, Gene Ontology (GO) aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species through three categories-cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF) and biological process (BP). The terms in each of the GO categories were presented in Fig. 4\nA. This analysis indicates that DEGs are more enriched with terms related to metabolic process, locomotion and biological adhesion in BP, extracellular region, matrix and synapse in CC as well as catalytic activity, transport and antioxidant activity in MF, respectively (Fig. 4A). Top GO terms of identified DEGs in three categories were presented in Table 4\n(p-value < 0.01). Moreover, annotated DEGs in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database were conducted KEGG pathway analysis to better understand the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks of DEGs in studied organism. As shown in Fig. 4B, there are 50 KEGG pathways included more than 46 annotated DEGs. Of these, 9 KEGG pathways contained genes which tended to be down-regulated, 37 contained genes which tended to be up-regulated and the remaining 4 KEGG pathways contained genes which tended to be differently expressed without regard of direction. Identified DEGs were enormously concentrated in the metabolism, cellular processes and environmental information processing pathways. Among those annotated DEGs, the typically up-regulated gene expression for cathepsins in lysosome pathway and Heat Shock 70 kDa Proteins, the down-regulated expression for collagen and protein kinase A, as well as mix-regulated carbonic anhydrase in nitrogen metabolism were presented in Table 5\n.

The validation of up-regulated expression of HSP70 and lysozyme in G-90\u2032 were conducted semi-q PCR and Western blot analyses. The DEGs of HSP70 and lysozyme were involved in a range of functions including endocytosis, MAPK signaling pathway, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosome process (Table 5). Of the genes tested by semi-q PCR, HSP70 and lysozyme were significantly up-regulated in 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 4-day regenerated tissue of tail-amputated E. fetida respectively compared to 0-day regeneration (G-90) (Fig. 5\nB and C).

Two expressed proteins in HSP70 family were also found significantly increased after 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 4-day post-amputation (Fig. 5E and F).

The validation of up-regulated expression of HSP70 and lysozyme in 3-day (G-90\u2032) and 4-day compared to 0-day (G-90) regenerated tissue illustrated that some functional proteins identified in G-90\u2019 was triggered expression after amputation process and these proteins may also explain regeneration mechanism of amputated earthworms.",

Referring to the protocol by Maria Marone et al., semi-q RT-PCR was performed to assess mRNA expression levels of HSP70 and lysozyme on different regeneration time of amputated E. fetida (Marone et al., 2001). A decreased mRNA levels in both HSP70 and lysozyme was detected after amputation for 12 h to 1 day, while their expression progressed incrementally in regenerated wound tissues and reached a high level after 3\u20134 days regeneration. The explanation for the sharply reduced mRNA levels may be the impaired metabolism after tail-amputation. Therefore, enzymatic reactions including DNA transcription, translation and RNA expression processes were delayed for the absence of timely energetic supply. The cross-reaction of HSC73 and HSP72 in HSP70 family may due to the highly homogenous recognition site for purchased HSP70 Rabbit Polyclonal primary antibody. This phenomenon also demonstrated by Barbara S. Polla et al. (Polla et al., 2007). In this study, up-regulated expression of HSP70s occurred after 3\u20134 days of regeneration in amputated E. fetida. However, lysozyme was not successfully detected presumably due to the low specific binding between protein and its antibody.",

            "text": "Although this is the first research to discuss HSP70 and lysozyme in regeneration process of tail-amputated E. fetida, their functional roles have been ubiquitous elucidated in other species. Lysozyme is widely distributed in nature from eukaryotes to prokaryotes (Joll\u00e8s, 1996; Prager and Jolles, 1996; Van Herreweghe and Michiels, 2012; Goto et al., 2007; Beintema and Terwisscha van Scheltinga, 1996; Callewaert and Michiels, 2010). Because of their original source, catalytic character and structure, lysozymes are divided into six groups, in which earthworm derived lysozyme belongs to invertebrate-type lysozyme (i-type lysozyme) (Joskova et al., 2009; Zavalova et al., 2000). Radka Joskova et al. successfully expressed recombinant Eisenia andrei lysozyme by using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and characterised it in innate defence system with lysozyme, isopeptidase, as well as anti-bacterial activities (Bachali et al., 2002). As to heat shock proteins (HSPs), they are generally grouped into six major families based on molecular weight, including HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40 and the small Heat Shock Protein family (Vos et al., 2008). Among them, HSP70 are the most studied HSPs due to its ubiquitous and highly conserved in all organisms (Feder and Hofmann, 1999; Morimoto, 1998). Daugaard et al. demonstrated that in eight members of HSP70 family, HSC73 (heat shock cognate) participates in cellular homeostasis and HSP72 is induced by stress conditions (Daugaard et al., 2007). Consistent with these analyses, we discovered their up-regulated expression in 3\u20134 days of regeneration of tail-amputated E. fetida by the cross-validation of semi-q PCR and western blot methods. Up-regulation of these proteins in earthworm regeneration period suggests their wound healing ability and reveals accelerated wound recovery mechanism for G-90\u2032 compared to G-90 in previous study.",
