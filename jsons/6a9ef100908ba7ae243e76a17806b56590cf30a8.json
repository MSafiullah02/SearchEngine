The frequency of emerging and reemerging infections and the risk of bioterrorism warrant significant efforts towards the development of prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures. Vaccines are the mainstay of infectious disease prophylaxis. Traditional vaccines, however, are failing to satisfy the global demand because of limited scalability of production systems, long production timelines and product safety concerns. Subunit vaccines are a highly promising alternative to traditional vaccines. Subunit vaccines, as well as monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic proteins, can be produced in heterologous expression systems based on bacteria, yeast, insect cells or mammalian cells, in shorter times and at higher quantities, and are efficacious and safe. However, current recombinant systems have certain limitations associated with production capacity and cost. Plants are emerging as a promising platform for recombinant protein production due to time and cost efficiency, scalability, lack of harboured mammalian pathogens and possession of the machinery for eukaryotic post-translational protein modification. So far, a variety of subunit vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic proteins (antivirals) have been produced in plants as candidate countermeasures against emerging, reemerging and bioterrorism-related infections. Many of these have been extensively evaluated in animal models and some have shown safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials. Here, we overview ongoing efforts to producing such plant-based countermeasures.",

Over 60% of emerging infections are caused by zoonotic pathogens, and approximately 72% of those are caused by pathogens derived from wildlife (Jones et al., 2008) . Contributing factors are often associated with human activity, resulting in increased human exposure to animal pathogens (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/pages/introduction.as px). For example, changes in human demographics and behaviour caused outbreaks of Chikungunya virus infection in Tanzania (Jones et al., 2008) . Furthermore, the excessive use of antimicrobial agents contributes to the development of drug-resistant strains of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. In addition to human activity, natural genetic variation and recombination and adaptation of known pathogens, such as influenza viruses, result in the appearance of new strains with epidemic and pandemic potential.",

            "text": "Besides those transmitted naturally, infectious diseases can also emerge via intentional release or dissemination of unmodified or engineered forms of life-threatening pathogens or biological toxins, used as agents of biowarfare or bioterrorism (http:// www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging; Balali-Mood et al., 2013) . The use of microbes and their products as bioweapons has a long history (Hilleman, 2002) . Poisoning and faecal contamination of arrows, spears and punji sticks were practised in ancient times. Contamination of water and food supplies, the projection of infected animal or human cadavers into enemy camps and release of infected rats were also employed in later centuries. By the beginning of the 20th century, biological warfare had acquired a scientific basis. For example, based on the discoveries in microbiology by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, Germany infected livestock and animal feed supplies during the World War I. Substantial biological warfare research on crop, animal and human pathogens and toxins was conducted by countries including Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States and the USSR during and after World War II. Due to the adoption of the international Biological Weapons Convention in 1972, which entered into force in 1975 (http:// www.opbw.org/convention/documents/btwctext.pdf), the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological and toxinbased weapons were prohibited (Christopher et al., 1997) . However, these efforts have not completely stopped biological warfare development. For example, in 1975, Iraq began an extensive programme that pursued production of weaponized Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium perfringens, wheat rust and toxins, and development of delivery systems for these bioweapons (Hilleman, 2002) . Therefore, there remains a threat that bioterrorist groups can use these pathogens for attacks against civilians. Indeed, after the series of postal mailings containing B. anthracis spores in the United States (Jernigan et al., 2001) , the risk of bioterrorism has remained high, promoting significant efforts towards the development of diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic measures for biodefence (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/ whoWeAre/Documents/niaidstrategicplan2008.pdf).",

Target populations for these vaccines vary, from general populations in case of seasonal influenza to populations living in or travelling to endemic areas in case of yellow fever to individuals at high risk of exposure such as the military personnel. The majority of approved vaccines against infectious diseases are based on live attenuated or killed whole pathogens. Despite demonstrated protective efficacy, most of them have limitations. Safety is the major issue with these vaccines. For example, BioThrax \u00e2 , the vaccine against anthrax, is based on protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis, but may also contain other components of the bacterium, such as lethal factor (LF) and oedema factor (EF). Therefore, the composition of BioThrax \u00e2 is not fully defined and varies from lot to lot. Because of the presence of LF and EF, the vaccine may cause severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis (Emergent BioSolutions, 2012) . In addition, to induce protective immunity, BioThrax \u00e2 should be administered in as many as five doses over a period of 18 months and at 1-year intervals thereafter (Emergent BioSolutions, 2012) .",

Serological analysis demonstrated that the H5 VLP vaccine did not significantly increase the levels of naturally occurring serum IgG against plant-specific glycans. Furthermore, no subjects in the study had a detectable IgE response to plant glycans before or after vaccination. The authors suggest that terminal GlcNAc could have shielded the proximal a-1,3-fucose and b-1,2xylose residues, preventing IgE cross-linking and mast cell/ basophil degranulation . Results of a larger human study with the same vaccine further demonstrated that no vaccinated subject developed IgE directed against MMXF/MUFX motifs, the known allergy-inducing cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants, and no subject showed symptoms of allergy/ hypersensitivity . The authors suggest that plant glycan-specific IgGs may have blocked IgE-mediated allergic responses in vaccinated subjects, contributing to allergen desensitization .",

Transgenic plants produce recombinant proteins with high efficiency but require relatively long development times to establish producer lines, and the expression of transgenes may decrease over time due to transcriptional gene silencing (Matzke et al., 2000) . Transplastomic plants contain abundant copies of a transgene, but the technology is still limited to relatively few species, and there are limitations on post-translational modification in chloroplasts Verma and Daniell, 2007) . The transient expression approach is now the most extensively used and allows for the production of large quantities of target proteins within a short time frame (Rybicki, 2010) , a particularly attractive feature in the case of pathogens that may be used for bioweapons and for epidemics.

Selected pathogens and characteristics of the diseases they cause, for which significant efforts towards plant-based candidate countermeasures have been made, are summarized in Table 1 . Pathogens considered by the CDC as bioterror agents include bacteria, viruses and bacteria-released toxins. Category A includes priority pathogens that pose the highest risk to national security and public health, because they can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, result in high mortality rates, might cause public panic and social disruption and require special action for public health preparedness. Category B, the second highest priority group, includes pathogens that are moderately easy to disseminate, result in moderate morbidity rates and low mortality rates and require specific enhancements for diagnostic capacity and enhanced disease surveillance. Category C includes pathogens that could be engineered as bioterrorism agents in the future.",

            "text": "Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the Grampositive, facultative anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium B. anthracis, a primary Category A pathogen (Brachman and Kaufmann, 1998; Koch, 1937) . Anthrax is a zoonotic disease but can occur in humans after exposure to infected animals or animal tissue (Davies, 1982; Van Ness, 1971) or via bioterrorism (http:// www.cdc.gov/anthrax/bioterrorism/index.html; Inglesby et al., 1999; Jernigan et al., 2001) . Of three forms of the disease caused by B. anthraciscutaneous, gastrointestinal and inhalationalanthrax caused by inhalation of aerosolized spores is most severe with the highest mortality rates of about 86-89% (Brachman et al., 1960) and, therefore, most important in the context of bioterrorism. The principal virulence factor of B. anthracis, 83-kDa PA, forms two exotoxins, lethal toxin (LeTx) and oedema toxin, via binding with LF or EF, respectively, which enter the cytoplasm leading to the cell death (Young and Collier, 2007) . PA elicits specific neutralizing antibodies that correlate with protective immunity (Fowler et al., 1999; Little et al., 1997 Little et al., , 2004 Pitt et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2006) and is the major target for anthrax vaccine development. The United States approved anthrax vaccine, BioThrax \u00e2 (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), is based on the PA protein prepared from cell-free filtrates of microaerophilic cultures of an avirulent, nonencapsulated strain of B. anthracis, formulated with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Emergent BioSolutions, 2012) . To achieve full protective efficacy, BioThrax \u00e2 should be administered in multiple doses (as many as five doses over a period of 18 months and at 1 year intervals thereafter) and may cause safety issues due to lot-to-lot variations in the composition (Emergent BioSolutions, 2012) . Over the last decade, significant efforts have been made towards the development of plant-based orally administered vaccines against anthrax. Initially, attempts have been made to produce anthrax subunit vaccine candidates in transgenic plants such as tomato, potato and mustard (Aziz et al., 2002 (Aziz et al., , 2005 Gorantala et al., 2014) . For example, full-length PA (PA83) was stably expressed in transgenic tobacco plants and demonstrated a cytotoxic activity similar to native PA in vitro when total soluble protein extracted from the transformed leaves was added to macrophage-like cells in combination with LF (Aziz et al., 2002) . Immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate was not evaluated. Subsequently, PA83 was expressed in transgenic tomato plants and, when administered intraperitoneally as total soluble protein extracted from the transgenic tomato leaves, elicited LeTx-neutralizing antibodies in mice. However, the transgene expression levels as well as the titres of antibodies raised were low (Aziz et al., 2005) . More recently, an attempt was made to develop a comprehensive orally administered vaccine suitable for both veterinary and human use. For this purpose, PA83 was expressed in transgenic mustard, Brassica juncea, whose leaves and stems can be consumed as a vegetable by humans and used as feed for cattle, although the expression levels and in vitro cytotoxicity of this PA83 varied due to random total soluble protein from transgenic B. juncea, adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or cholera toxin (CT) and generated significant anti-PA IgG titres (Gorantala et al., 2014) . Significant serum IgA titres and faecal secretory IgA titres were also detected, indicating the development of mucosal immune responses. Oral immunization with either adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted PA83 from B. juncea conferred 60% survival on mice following lethal intraperitoneal anthrax challenge (Gorantala et al., 2014) .",

Using optimized chloroplast protein expression conditions, an increased expression of PA83 compared with nuclear transgenic tobacco plants has been achieved (Aziz et al., 2005) . The chloroplast-derived PA protein exhibited a potent cytotoxic effect against a macrophage cell line in vitro in the presence of LF. Similar to PA83 from transgenic B. juncea, chloroplast-derived PA83 generated significant serum anti-PA IgG and IgA titres following oral administration with CT adjuvant, indicating the development of both systemic and mucosal immune responses (Gorantala et al., 2014) . Furthermore, orally immunized mice demonstrated 80% survival after lethal anthrax challenge (Gorantala et al., 2014) . In addition to full-length PA, its fragment, PA domain 4 (PA[dIV]), has also been expressed in tobacco chloroplasts and the expression levels were found to be significantly higher compared with nuclear transformation (up to 5.3% vs. 0.8% of total soluble protein) (Gorantala et al., 2011) . Both intraperitoneal and oral immunizations with total soluble protein from the PA(dIV) transplastomic plants elicited antibody titres of >10 4 , similar to Escherichia coli-derived PA(dIV), which were predominantly of the IgG1 subtype and possessed toxinneutralizing activity in vitro. In addition, intraperitoneal and oral immunization with chloroplast-derived PA(dIV), adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or CT, respectively, each conferred 60% protection of mice against lethal anthrax challenge, respectively, compared with 100% and 80% protection with adjuvanted E. coli-derived PA(dIV). Further evaluation of mucosal responses following oral immunizations detected low secretory IgA titres in faecal extracts from mice receiving adjuvanted plant-or E. coli-derived PA(dIV). In addition, anti-PA(dIV) antisera enhanced B. anthracis spore uptake by macrophages in vitro and suppressed spore germination (Gorantala et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Daniell and colleagues have successfully introduced the fulllength PA gene into the chloroplast genome of tobacco plants and achieved the expression levels of up to 2.5 mg of PA83 per gram of fresh leaf tissue with target stability in leaves or crude plant extract for several months. Chloroplast-derived PA83 was cytotoxic against mouse macrophages in vitro in the presence of LF (Watson et al., 2004) . Results of animal studies showed that partially purified chloroplast-derived PA83 adjuvanted with Alhydrogel can induce IgG titres of up to 1:320 000 and confer 100% protection of mice against intraperitoneal LeTx challenge following subcutaneous immunization. Similar results were observed with purified PA from B. anthracis, suggesting that the plant-derived PA was properly folded and fully functional (Koya et al., 2005) . Calculations demonstrated that one acre of PA83 transplastomic tobacco plants can produce up to 360 million doses of anthrax PA vaccine (Koya et al., 2005) . An alternative approach is based on the development of anthrax subunit vaccines for parenteral administration, and these vaccine candidates are produced in plants via transient expression. For example, an anthrax subunit vaccine candidate has been designed , comprising domain 4 of PA and domain 1 of LF that were separately fused to a carrier, LicKM, modified lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum . The vaccine was expressed in agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a previously described tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based hybrid vector Shoji et al., 2009) . Mice immunized with this dual anthrax vaccine candidate adjuvanted with complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant developed high titres of anti-PA and anti-LF IgG1 as well as LeTx-neutralizing antibodies . Using the same expression system, a single-component anthrax vaccine candidate was subsequently produced in N. benthamiana plants, comprising nonfused, full-length, glycosylated, recombinant PA83 . This new vaccine elicited high titres of toxin-neutralizing antibodies in mice and rabbits after two administrations in the presence of Alhydrogel. Furthermore, rabbits that received the adjuvanted PA83 were completely protected from a lethal aerosolized B. anthracis challenge. The vaccine antigen formulated with Alhydrogel was found to be stable and retained immunogenicity after 2-week storage at 4\u00b0C, which is suitable for clinical use. Safety and immunogenicity of the plant-produced PA83 in healthy adults aged 18-49 years are currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02239172) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT02239172?term=pa83&rank=1), in which immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate is being assessed as changes in serum antibody titres from baseline after three intramuscular immunizations at four dose levels in the presence of Alhydrogel.",

For example, pp-PA83 was not able to combine with LF, form LeTx and induce cell death in vitro (Mamedov, T., Chichester, J.A., Jones, R.M., Ghosh, A., Coffin, M.V., Herschbach, K., Prokhnevsky, A.I., Streatfield, S.J., Yusibov, V., in preparation.) . To eliminate the negative impact of aberrant glycosylation, a nonglycosylated version of PA83 was produced in N. benthamiana plants by co-expressing bacterial peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Previously, this strategy was proven efficient, as co-expression of PNGase F resulted in in vivo deglycosylation of Pfs48/45, a sexual stage antigen from P. falciparum, in N. benthamiana plants (Mamedov et al., 2012) . In planta deglycosylated pp-PA83, pp-dPA83, regained the ability to form LeTx in vitro and induced significantly higher levels of toxin-neutralizing antibody responses in mice compared with glycosylated pp-PA83.",

For example, genetic fusion of a 15-amino acid epitope from domain 4 of PA (PA-D4) into alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein (AlMV CP) and introduction of this construct into the P12 strain of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun NN plants (expressing AlMV P1 and P2 replicase genes) resulted in high yields of the fusion protein and its assembly into chimeric VLPs (Brodzik et al., 2005) . Two intraperitoneal immunizations of mice with these purified recombinant VLPs, in the presence of complete (for the first immunization) or incomplete (for the second immunization) Freund's adjuvant, elicited serum antibodies reacting with PA; however, a detectable anthrax-specific antibody response was observed in only two of five immunized mice. In another study by the same group, hepatitis B core protein (HBcAg) carrying PA-D4 was expressed in transgenic low-alkaloid N. tabacum cv. LAMD609 plants (Bandurska et al., 2008) . Electron microscopy did not detect formation of VLPs by this recombinant chimeric protein, in contrast to unconjugated HBcAg. Immunogenicity of the purified protein in mice was evaluated following three intramuscular injections in the presence of adjuvant (combination of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and Alhydrogel). Analysis of immunized mouse sera demonstrated the presence of significant anti-PA IgG titres, which were predominantly IgG2a/IgG2b subtypes, consistent with the serum IgG profile of mice immunized with PA83 (Bandurska et al., 2008) . Neither AlMV CP-nor HBcAg-based plant-produced vaccine candidates were assessed for protective efficacy.",

In a subsequent study, both glycosylated and nonglycosylated (PANG) versions of the anti-PA monoclonal antibody were produced in N. benthamiana plants . Both glycosylated monoclonal antibody and PANG monoclonal antibody neutralized anthrax LeTx activity in vitro and protected mice against an intraperitoneal challenge with spores of B. anthracis Sterne strain (90% and 100% survival, respectively). When tested in nonhuman primates (NHPs), the PANG monoclonal antibody was superior to the glycosylated anti-PA monoclonal antibody, exhibiting a significantly longer terminal half-life and 100% protection (vs. 40% protection for the glycosylated anti-PA monoclonal antibody) against challenge with a lethal dose of aerosolized anthrax spores.

            "text": "Plague, the cause of major pandemics and epidemics throughout human history, is caused by a Category A Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, intracellular bacterium Y. pestis whose life cycle includes fleas and small mammals, primarily rodents (www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/plague). Numerous data suggest that Y. pestis recently evolved from the enteric bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that adapted to an insect vector (the flea) and transmission between mammalian hosts via subcutaneous and pneumonic routes. A common route of bacterial transmission from animal to animal is by the bite of an infected flea. After the flea ingests blood containing Y. pestis from a rodent host, the bacterium multiplies in the flea gut, resulting in blood clotting in the proventriculus and blocking the food (blood) passage from the oesophagus to the midgut. During feeding, the blocked flea regurgitates infected blood into the bloodstream of the mammal, transmitting the bacterium to the next host (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007) . Transmission of the pathogen to humans may occur through the flea bite, contact with fluids from an infected animal or aspiration of respiratory droplets from an infected animal or an individual with pneumonic lesions. Depending on how the bacterium enters the body, plague can manifest in three clinical forms, bubonic (the most common form of naturally occurring plague), septicaemic or pneumonic, with pneumonic plague being the most virulent and fatal form of the disease (Cobbs and Chansolme, 2004; Inglesby et al., 2000; Perry and Fetherston, 1997 ; www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/plague). A formalinkilled whole-cell Y. pestis vaccine against plague was the only plague vaccine licensed in the United States, but it was not effective against pneumonic plague and its manufacture was discontinued in 1999 (Titball and Williamson, 2004) .",

Fusion protein (F1-LcrV)-based orally administered plague subunit vaccine candidates have been produced by generating F1-LcrV transgenic plants such as tomato (Alvarez et al., 2006) , lettuce (Rosales-Mendoza et al., 2010) and carrot tap root (Rosales-Mendoza et al., 2011) , and their immunogenicity following either oral or subcutaneous administration has been evaluated. For example, mice were subcutaneously primed with bacteria-produced F1-LcrV and then orally boosted with several doses of freeze-dried F1-LcrV transgenic tomato fruits along with bacterial CT as an adjuvant. The immunized mice were shown to generate antigen-specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA (Alvarez et al., 2006) . When these immunized mice were subcutaneously challenged with a 20 9 LD 50 dose of Y. pestis, protection was observed in 50% of the animals, compared with 20% when mice were boosted with nontransgenic tomato (Alvarez and Cardineau, 2010) . The authors explained the observed medium level of mouse protection by the extended time interval allowed between the last vaccine boost and the bacterial challenge (18 months), which, according to a previous report (Fujihashi et al., 2000) , may have resulted in a reduced ability of these aged mice to elicit systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immune responses. On the other hand, the results indicate that protection against Y. pestis was maintained over long term. The level of target accumulation originally obtained in the freeze-dried transgenic tomato tissue was high (4-10% total soluble protein) (Alvarez et al., 2006) ; however, it was subsequently increased (up to 16% total soluble protein) by means of P19-induced suppression of RNA-mediated target gene silencing (Alvarez et al., 2008) .",

Mice that were primed subcutaneously with Alhydrogel-adsorbed F1-LcrV and then repeatedly boosted orally with unadjuvanted F1-LcrV generated substantial titres of antigen-specific serum IgG of predominantly IgG1 isotype, which were higher than in mice that were subcutaneously boosted with adjuvanted F1-LcrV. Antigen-specific serum IgA titres were also detected in F1-LcrV-boosted mice. Among orally boosted mice, 88% were protected against lethal aerosolized Y. pestis challenge, compared with 33% of mice that were subcutaneously boosted, indicating that oral booster with F1-LcrV elicited protective immune responses (Arlen et al., 2008) .

All these vaccine antigens, injected subcutaneously in three doses into guinea pigs, elicited antigenspecific serum IgG and conferred significant protection against an aerosol challenge with virulent Y. pestis at 21 days postexposure, with the highest survival rate (six of eight animals) for LcrV vaccination, followed by F1-LcrV vaccination (five of eight animals) (Santi et al., 2006) . These plant-produced plague antigens weakly activated innate immune cells (human monocytes), but induced antigen-specific T-cell and antibody responses similar to those occurring during Y. pestis infection (Del Prete et al., 2009) . F1 and LcrV antigens were also produced in N. benthamiana plants as fusions to the LicKM carrier , either single [F1-LicKM and LcrV-LicKM ] or dual [F1-LcrV-LicKM (Chichester et al., 2009b) ]. Three subcutaneous injections of combined F1-LicKM and LcrV-LicKM, adjuvanted with Alhydrogel, elicited strong serum IgG and IgA titres and conferred complete protection on Cynomolgus macaques against lethal challenge with Y. pestis . Similarly, F1-LcrV-LicKM, adjuvanted with Alhydrogel and Quil A and administered subcutaneously in three doses, induced high titres of serum IgG, predominantly of the IgG1 isotype, against both F1 and LcrV. F1-LcrV-LicKM also fully protected Cynomolgus macaques against lethal challenge with aerosolized Y. pestis (Chichester et al., 2009b) , suggesting the strong potential as a vaccine candidate against pneumonic plague.",

            "text": "Smallpox, a disfiguring and highly contagious infectious disease affecting human populations since ancient times, is caused by the Variola virus, a Category A pathogen. Symptoms appear 12-14 days after infection and include fever, malaise, headache, prostration, severe back pain, and sometimes abdominal pain and vomiting. Two to three days later, the body temperature falls and a rash appears, primarily on the face, hands, forearms and the trunk. Historically, the mortality of ordinary smallpox is approximately 30%. Transmission of the virus occurs through inhalation of aerosols or droplets from infected symptomatic people. Due to the WHO-initiated global immunization campaign, smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 and routine vaccinations have been stopped (Fenner et al., 1988; www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/smallpox) . The risk for smallpox occurring as a result of bioterrorism is considered very low. However, high-risk groups, such as scientists and medical professionals working with smallpox and similar viruses in a research setting, and military personnel, are still required to receive the vaccine. Following recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, sufficient amounts of smallpox vaccine doses are now available to vaccinate every person in the United States, if needed. The licensed smallpox vaccine is based on live vaccinia virus and is highly effective (http:// www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/prep/cdc-prep.asp; http://www. bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/facts.asp).",

Transient expression in N. benthamiana, based on Magnifection TM (Gleba et al., 2005) , resulted in rapid production of soluble B5 to high yields. Nuclear transformation of tobacco and collard resulted in stable production of soluble and insoluble forms of B5, respectively. The authors observed major differences in plantproduced B5 (pB5) immunogenicity depending on protein solubility and route of administration. Mice were immunized via oral, intranasal or parenteral routes. For oral immunization, the animals received B5-transgenic fresh collard leaves or lyophilized and powdered leaf pellets, with or without CT as a mucosal adjuvant, by mouth, or purified (>50%) pB5 with CT through gavage. No B5-specific IgG titres were detected in mouse sera even in the presence of the CT adjuvant, despite the presence of systemic and intestinal anti-CT antibodies. For intranasal immunization, mice were administered three doses of purified pB5, with or without CT adjuvant. In the presence of CT, purified pB5 elicited B5specific serum IgG. Parenteral immunization with purified pB5 was performed by two subcutaneous injections with Freund's adjuvant and one intraperitoneal injection without adjuvant and resulted in the highest anti-B5 IgG titres. Furthermore, when purified pB5 was given to mice in three intramuscular injections in the presence of the CpG/alum adjuvant combination, it induced anti-B5 serum IgG titres that reduced vaccinia virus spread in the comet inhibition assay and conferred protection against a lethal challenge with vaccinia virus (Golovkin et al., 2007) .",

In contrast to intramuscular immunization, intranasal vaccination induced not only B5-specific serum IgG but also IgA in the respiratory tract, which was dose dependent. The analysis of IgG isotypes demonstrated balanced IgG1/IgG2a (Th1/Th2) anti-B5 responses, essential for protection against vaccinia virus (Matsui et al., 2005; Reading and Smith, 2003) , after both intramuscular and intranasal vaccination. Contamina-tion of purified pB5 with increased amounts of total soluble protein from wild-type tobacco plants decreased B5-specific antibody responses, especially those induced by intranasal immunization, and shifted them towards the Th2 type.

Viruses associated with most VHFs are zoonotic and naturally reside in animal reservoir hosts or arthropod vectors. Humans can become infected through contact with infected animal tissues or inhalation of aerosolized excreta. For some VHFs, such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Crimean-Congo viruses, transmission from person to person may also occur, through contact with infected blood or body secretions. Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VHF, but initial symptoms of VHFs often include fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength and exhaustion. While the disease can be very mild, patients with severe cases of VHFs often show signs of the overall vascular system damage, including bleeding. Severely ill patients may also show shock, nervous system malfunction, coma, delirium, seizures and kidney failure (http://www.cdc.gov/ ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/Viral_Hemorrha gic_Fevers_Fact_Sheet.pdf; Borio et al., 2002; Weber and Rutala, 2001) .

The vaccine demonstrated an optimal balance between reactogenicity and immunogenicity (Ambrosio et al., 2011). Currently, there are four producers of yellow fever vaccines that are prequalified by the World Health Organization to supply vaccines to international agencies: Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz (17DD-YFV, Brazil), Sanofi-Pasteur (YF-Vax \u00e2 , France), Institute Pasteur in Dakar (Senegal) and Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides (Russian Federation).

So far, an antibody-based therapy is the most advanced Ebola treatment option. A monoclonal antibody cocktail, MB-003, consisting of human and human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibodies c13C6, h13F6 and c6D8 (the latter two virus neutralizing), was produced by Mapp Biophamaceutical, Inc. (San Diego, CA) in the glycoengineered N. benthamiana line \u0394XTFT, an RNAi-based double knockout glycosylation mutant lacking plant-specific N-linked xylose and core fucose residues (Strasser et al., 2008; Zeitlin et al., 2011) , using Magnifection (Gleba et al., 2005) . When MB-003 was administered to rhesus macaques intravenously 1 h postinfection, followed by two additional doses on days 4 and 8, all three treated monkeys were protected against intramuscular lethal challenge with EBOV. Furthermore, MB-003 was partially protective (four of six monkeys) if the treatment was given 24 or 48 h postinfection, whereas no monkeys survived in the untreated group. In addition, plant-produced MB-003 was three times as potent as the Chinese hamster ovary cell-produced recombinant counterpart monoclonal antibodies (Olinger et al., 2012) . The difference is suggested to be due to the absence of the core fucose on the Fc region of the plant-derived monoclonal antibodies leading to increased antibody binding to the Fc receptor gamma RIII and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity compared with monoclonal antibodies produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Zeitlin et al., 2011) . Based on these results, the authors suggest that antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity plays a critical role in the protective efficacy conferred by MB-003 (Olinger et al., 2012) .",

Providing the drug in sufficient quantities is a challenge because of the high dose of ZMapp required for optimal therapy [approximately 10.5 g of ZMapp for three administrations to a human being of a 70 kg weight, based on the 50 mg/kg dose given to monkeys (Qiu et al., 2014) ] and a currently limited capacity for large-scale GMP plant production (Rybicki, 2014) . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has signed a contract with Mapp Biopharmaceutical to accelerate the drug's development (McCarthy, 2014) . Several other plant biopharming companies are also gearing up to produce the ZMapp monoclonal antibody components. For example, Medicago (Quebec, Canada), under a task order from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) at HHS, and as a part of the Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract between Medicago and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), will be producing three anti-Ebola virus monoclonal antibodies with performance comparable to that of ZMapp, for studying in NHPs. Preliminary results have shown that the technology utilized by Medicago allows for rapidly producing anti-Ebola antibodies with high yields, thereby potentially boosting production amounts and worldwide supply (http://www.medicago.com/files/docu-ments_news/2015/Ebola-PR_USA_-English-Final_v001_j1v036. pdf). Similarly, the Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology is producing these anti-Ebola virus monoclonal antibodies for BARDA. Additionally, Caliber Biotherapeutics reported on its readiness to produce commercial quantities of ZMapp monoclonal antibodies quickly and cost-effectively (Moore, 2014) .",

            "text": "A transient plant expression strategy has also been applied towards the production of an antibody/antigen fusion-type vaccine against Ebola. This recombinant immune fusion complex is based on an anti-Ebola IgG antibody carrying fused GP1 . In a previous study, plant-produced tetanus toxin fragment C-IgG immune complexes were described and reported to bind to the complement factor C1q and Fc receptor gamma RIIa and to be targeted to antigen-presenting cells. These immune complexes, injected subcutaneously without adjuvant, are very highly immunogenic and fully protective in mice, comparable with the commercial antigen adjuvanted with alum. In contrast, plant-produced nonadjuvanted antigen did not induce protective immunity (Chargelegue et al., 2005) . To produce Ebola immune complexes, a heavy chain (Hc) and light chain (Lc) of the humanized 6D8 IgG monoclonal antibody directed against a linear epitope on Ebola GP1, with the GP1 subunit genetically fused to the C-terminus of the 6D8 monoclonal antibody Hc, were transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana plants , using the previously developed bean yellow dwarf virus-based geminiviral replicon system (Huang et al., 2010) . Due to the interaction between the 6D8 epitopes and 6D8 binding sites, the recombinant Hc and Lc assembled into a full-size chimeric IgG that formed immune complexes in planta, capable of binding C1q. In mice, subcutaneous immunization with four doses of these purified Ebola immune complexes, without adjuvant, elicited anti-Ebola virus antibody production at levels comparable to those obtained with the positive control, GP1 VLPs , based on recombinant RNA replicons derived from an attenuated strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Pushko et al., 2000) . In the follow-up study, the authors observed that administration of the Ebola immune complexes along with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, as an adjuvant, elicited a more robust antibody response in mice compared with the immune complexes alone. Furthermore, these vaccine-induced antibodies protected 80% of vaccinated mice against lethal challenge with live mouse-adapted Ebola virus, which correlated with mixed Th1/Th2 humoral responses to the antigen . Overall, the results suggest the strong potential of the Ebola immune complexes as vaccine candidates against Ebola.",

Several studies reported on production of E protein-based subunit vaccines against dengue fever. For example, domain III (DIII) of dengue type 2 E protein (D2EIII; amino acids 298-400) was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana plants using a TMV-based vector, as confirmed by anti-D2EIII antibody binding (Saejung et al., 2007) . D2EIII expression was increased by incorporating the N-terminal plant signal peptide, the C-terminal ER retention sequence and the N-terminal 5 0 untranslated region-omega sequence located upstream of D2EIII, resulting in high level accumulation of the D2EIII protein (0.28% of total soluble protein). Intramuscular immunization of mice with D2EIII elicited virus-specific serum IgG with neutralizing activity against dengue type 2 virus. However, the immunogenicity of D2EIII was low, even in the presence of the TiterMax Gold adjuvant. This was suggested to be due to the small size of the recombinant antigen (Saejung et al., 2007) .",

G C and G N have previously been shown to contain immunogenic epitopes capable of inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies (Ahmed et al., 2005) . G C /G N was expressed in transgenic tobacco hairy root cultures and leaves, to levels of 1.8 mg/kg and 1.4 mg/kg of fresh biomass, respectively. To evaluate immunogenicity of the G C /G N subunit vaccine candidate, mice were vaccinated using the following protocols: orally, by administering five 10-lg doses of transgenic leaf or hairy root pellets, at 1-week intervals; orally, by administering four 10-lg doses of transgenic leaf or hairy root pellets at 1-week intervals, followed by a single subcutaneous boost with the amount of total soluble protein equivalent to 5 lg of plant-made G C /G N ; and subcutaneously, with four doses of an inactivated CCHFV vaccine, at 2-week intervals. The unvaccinated mice received a mixed pellet of wild-type leaves and roots. All groups of vaccinated mice developed antigen-specific IgG titres in sera and IgA in faeces, indicative of a mucosal immune response. However, mice that were orally immunized and then subcutaneously boosted demonstrated a significant rise in antigenspecific IgG titres (1:32 000) compared with mice that were only orally immunized (1:256). Plant-produced G C /G N reacted with human serum IgG from a patient who had recovered from CCHF. Generally, the results suggest the potential for G C /G N as an orally administered vaccine against CCHF; however, for practical administration, low target yields will need to be addressed prior to scaling up production.",

The N protein accumulated in transgenic plants, whereas expression of truncated G N was not detectable by Western blot.

Although N protein-induced IgG titres were higher than those for truncated G N , they were 10-to 100-fold lower than after a single subcutaneous injection of bacterial derived N protein. Similarly, the nucleocapsid protein of Hantavirus serotype Puumala was produced in transgenic tobacco and potato plants.

The plantderived DIII was soluble, with correct conformation and epitope display, as demonstrated by specific binding to a monoclonal antibody hE16 recognizing a native WNV DIII conformational epitope. Subcutaneous immunization of mice with four doses of alum-adjuvanted purified DIII elicited potent antigen-specific serum IgG titres that bound to the native form of the viral DIII antigen and were exclusively of the IgG1 isotype, indicating a Th2-type immune response (He et al., 2014b) . The importance of IgG1 in the WNV protective immunity has previously been demonstrated by fractionation of WNV-neutralizing human immunoglobulins. The results indicated that IgG1 was the main antibody isotype induced following WNV infection, contained almost the entire in vitro WNV neutralization activity and conferred superior protection on WNV-susceptible mice compared with other isotypes and unfractionated immunoglobulins (Hofmeister et al., 2011) . Full-length E protein of WNV was also expressed (Chen, 2015) , using glycoengineered N. benthamiana line \u0394XTFT, a glycosylation mutant lacking plant-specific N-linked glycan residues (Strasser et al., 2008) . Inclusion of domains DI and DII significantly reduced leaf necrosis and increased recombinant protein accumulation to~600 mg/kg of fresh leaf tissue. Immunization of mice with this full-size E protein, in the presence of alum, elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses, specific for both the E protein and DIII, and induced cytokine release. Both IgG and cytokines were predominantly of the Th2 type (Chen, 2015) .",

These included full-size plant-based hE16; hE16scFv-C H 1-3 , a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of hE16 fused to the constant domains of human IgG Hc (C H ) ; and Tetra-hE16, a tetravalent molecule assembled from hE16scFv-C H 1-3 with a second hE16scFv fused to the constant domain of Lc (C L ) (He et al., 2014a,b) . Both hE16scFv-C H and Tetra-hE16 were efficiently expressed and assembled in plants and were efficacious, exhibiting at least equivalent in vitro neutralization and in vivo mouse protection compared to mammalian cell-produced hE16. The study also demonstrated differences in the N-glycosylation patterns of these hE16 variants, suggesting that proper pairing of Hc and Lc was essential for complete N-glycosylation of the antibodies. Differential glycosylation resulted in different binding of the variants to C1q and specific Fc gamma receptors. None of these variants showed antibody-dependent enhancement activity in vitro, indicating the potential of plants to produce antibodies or antibody-like molecules that minimize this pathogenic reaction in patients that occurs as a result of the Fc-Fc gamma receptor interaction (He et al., 2014a,b) . In another study , to produce targets carrying mammalian-like N-linked glycans, hE16 and hE16scFv-C H were expressed in the glycoengineered N. benthamiana line \u0394XTFT (Strasser et al., 2008) . The resulting glycoengineered variants exhibited enhanced WNV neutralization in vitro and equivalent protection of mice against a lethal WNV challenge, even at 4 days postinfection, to the parental mouse E16 monoclonal antibody. Between the two glycoengineered variants, expression and protective efficacy were equivalent, indicating the potential of hE16scFv-C H as an alternative to hE16 . Overall, the data demonstrate the feasibility of cost-effectively producing anti-WNV monoclonal antibody-based therapies with an improved safety profile.",

            "text": "Although influenza virus is only classified as a Category C pathogen, it remains a major public health concern as a reemerging infection. From 1976 to 2007 in the United States, the estimated annual average of influenza-associated deaths, resulting from respiratory and circulatory causes, including pneumonia and influenza, was about 23 600 (ranging from 3349 to 48 614), which corresponds to a range of 1.4-16.7 deaths per 100 000 persons (CDC, 2010) . During annual epidemics, 3-5 million cases of severe influenza illness are recorded worldwide, resulting in 250 000-500 000 deaths (www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/index.html). In addition to seasonal influenza outbreaks, occasional influenza pandemics can arise at any time when an influenza A virus containing a novel HA subtype emerges and spreads efficiently among humans. In 2009, a novel influenza A H1N1 virus of swine origin [A(H1N1)pdm09] emerged and infected humans. The virus, a triple reassortant with genes acquired from swine, avian and human influenza viruses , was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009 (Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team et al., 2009) and spread rapidly across the globe, primarily in children and young adult populations with little pre-existing serologic immunity to the novel HA (Hancock et al., 2009) , causing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on 11 June 2009 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_-pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/). Nearly 30 000 confirmed cases in 74 countries were reported. Of those, about 2% developed severe illness, often with very rapid progression to lifethreatening pneumonia, although the number of deaths was small (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/ h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/). Furthermore, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) virus that spread rapidly from 2004 onwards and caused serious poultry outbreaks in several Asian countries, Europe and Africa is also able to infect humans. Among more than 500 individuals who have been infected with H5N1 viruses, the mortality rate is 50-60% (www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm; www.who.int/influenza/ human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/en/; http://www.who. int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_ archives/en/). Although almost all reported human cases have had close contact with infected birds, with very rare instances of presumed human to human transmission, considerable concern for human health remains, not only because of the severity of human cases, but also because the virus could undergo adaptive mutation or reassortment and obtain the ability to spread efficiently among humans (www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm; www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/ en/; http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N 1_cumulative_table_archives/en/). Should these events occur, H5N1 and/or other novel viruses could have the potential to cause a pandemic exhibiting a very aggressive clinical progression with devastating consequences for global health and economies.",

Traditionally, influenza vaccines are manufactured by propagating influenza viruses in embryonated hens' eggs. Because of continued changes in the multiple circulating epidemic strains of influenza viruses and a lack of pre-existing immunity to emerging viruses, manufacturing of new upgraded vaccines is required on an annual basis. HA, the most abundant surface glycoprotein of influenza virus, responsible for binding to cell surface receptors and internalization of the virus, plays a key role in virus infectivity and pathogenesis (Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Wilson et al., 1981) . It is well recognized that protection provided by influenza vaccines is mediated primarily by anti-HA highly neutralizing antibodies (Han and Marasco, 2011) , making HA the major target for influenza subunit vaccine development (Athmaram et al., 2011; Cox, 2008; Mischler and Metcalfe, 2002; Wu et al., 2010) . Anti-HA antibodies can inhibit the hemagglutination activity of HA, and this hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) is used as a correlate of protection for the evaluation and licensing of influenza vaccines (US FDA, 2007) .",

Engineered CPMV-based VLPs displaying the ectodomain epitope of the M2 protein (M2e) of human or avian influenza A viruses (M2eH and M2eA, respectively) and transiently expressed in Vigna unguiculata have also been produced (Meshcheryakova et al., 2009) . Due to poor yield and weak animal immunogenicity, these chimeric CPMV-M2e VLPs are unlikely to progress to clinical development. The M2e influenza epitope was also engineered as a fusion to the human papillomavirus 16 L1 carrier protein and expressed in N. benthamiana using a CPMV-derived vector (Matic et al., 2011) . Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this vaccine candidate have not been reported.",

            "text": "In addition to a vaccine, antiviral compounds may be promising countermeasures against viral infections. For example, griffithsin, the 12.7-kDa lectin from the red algae Griffithsia sp. with an antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), binds terminal mannose residues of N-linked glycans on the surface of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 and blocks virus entry into host cells (Mori et al., 2005) . Due to its structure (the presence of carbohydrate recognition domains and formation of domain-swapped dimers) (Zi o\u0142kowska et al., 2006) , griffithsin may have a broader activity and inhibit other enveloped viruses that display similar glycan structures. For example, recombinant bacteria-derived griffithsin has been shown to be active against JEV in vitro and in vivo, completely protecting mice against lethal viral challenge (Ishag et al., 2013) . The potential of griffithsin is further supported by its successful production in N. benthamiana using TMV-based transient expression approach, with a yield of 300 mg/kg of fresh biomass, and recovered at a purity of >99% (O'Keefe et al., 2009) . The plant-produced griffithsin exhibited antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, via specific binding to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein) (O'Keefe et al., 2009) . The efficacy of griffithsin was demonstrated using a lethal mouse model of pulmonary infection, where intranasal treatment with griffithsin protected animals against SARS infection. Mechanisms of CoV disease pathogenesis are believed to involve excessive and dysregulated cytokine/chemokine responses by pro-inflammatory cells (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . The results of the current study support this hypothesis: treatment with griffithsin significantly reduced the production of several cytokines in mouse lung tissue, including IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, G-CSF, MCP-1 and IL-12(p40), by 4 days postinfection, compared results with untreated infected mice (O'Keefe et al., 2010) .",

In vitro, using a Vero cell-based cytotoxicity assay, murine hybridoma-produced GD12 was shown to bind ricin holotoxin with high affinity (dissociation constant of 2.9 9 10 \u00c09 M) and neutralize it with a 50% inhibitory concentration of~0.25 lg/mL. In vivo, passive administration of GD12, by intraperitoneal injection or via the 'backpack tumour', protected mice against systemic (intraperitoneal) and mucosal (intragastric) ricin challenge, respectively (Neal et al., 2010) . Based on the properties of the murine GD12 monoclonal antibody, an engineered version of this monoclonal antibody was produced in plants. The plant-derived version was a chimeric derivative of GD12 (cGD12), in which the murine Hc and Lc variable regions were fused to a human IgG1 framework, which was engineered and transiently expressed in N. benthamiana (O'Hara et al., 2012) . Plant-produced cGD12 demonstrated epitope specificity and ricin neutralizing activity similar to those of the native murine monoclonal antibody. Passive administration of cGD12 by intraperitoneal injection protected mice against a systemic ricin challenge. To assess the efficacy of this monoclonal antibody postricin exposure, GD12 and cGD12 were administered 6 h after toxin challenge and shown to rescue mice from toxin-induced death. Thus, plant-produced cGD12 has potential as both a prophylactic and a therapeutic treatment against ricin intoxication.",

Whereas vaccines are the mainstay of infectious disease prophylaxis, traditional vaccines are failing to satisfy the global demand because of limited scalability of production systems, long production timelines and product safety concerns. Similar issues are applicable to therapeutic antibodies and anti-infective agents. These concerns may be addressed by the development of safe, cost-effective and scalable plant-based subunit vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant therapeutic proteins.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, subunit vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antivirals against a range of emerging, reemerging and bioterrorism-related pathogens have been produced in different plant expression systems and evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. In recent years, there have been marked improvements in the levels of plant-produced target expression, yield, purity and reproducibility and in the construction of facilities capable of producing material under cGMP for clinical trials and commercial use. Improved yields and efficacy of these candidate countermeasures suggest feasibility of the use of plant-based products in the fight against such diseases. However, the difference between the number of preclinical studies (summarized in Table 2 ) and clinical trials (summarized in Table 3 ) conducted on these plant-produced candidate countermeasures is considerable. This partly reflects the normal narrowing down of potential product candidates from preclinical to clinical studies, but also reflects the fact that many of the preclinical studies were proof-of-principle investigations, not necessarily targeted for the clinic. However, there is increasing momentum to advance lead plant-based candidates into the clinic, and in recent years, the regulatory and commercial landscape has started changing in favour of plant-derived subunit vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic proteins for human use, exemplified by the licensing and commercial release of taliglucerase alfa. However, to approve and commercialize a plant-produced candidate, regulatory authorities consider not only its safety and efficacy, but also its additional factors, including the effective dose, the number of required doses and product stability during storage. In addition, while some subunit vaccines require an adjuvant, others, such as viruslike particles, may be efficacious alone. These factors would reflect the ultimate product cost. With regard to product stability, subunit vaccines or therapeutic proteins delivered via oral route may undergo rapid degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, which stresses the need for protective formulation.",
