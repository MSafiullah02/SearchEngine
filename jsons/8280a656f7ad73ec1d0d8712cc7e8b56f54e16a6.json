Pneumonia, sepsis, surgical site infections and urinary tract infections are most often associated with patient-related use of medical devices for approximately 65% of cases, while nontechnical equipment may be linked to 35% of cases. It is resource-intensive to detect the cause of infection outbreaks and even more expensive not to take action. Unexplained causes of outbreaks may lead to uncertainty and reduced activity at the hospital. To trace and prevent hospital outbreaks, joint efforts from hospital management, microbiology and infection control are needed. This chapter is focused on practical measures to trace and prevent hospital outbreaks.",

In the case of ultraclean surgery, air contamination is dominant and most bacteria come from the operating staff. Therefore, fewest (possible) participants should be present during the operation. \u2022 Review written washing and cleaning procedures-wash with soap and water between each operation to remove biological material, disinfect after infected operations and follow procedures for major cleaning and disinfection. \u2022 Is the temperate air regulated from the outside? Heaters/refrigeration systems located in the operating department generate uncontrolled air circulation and must not be used (growth of fungi and bacteria are spread into the room together with skin cells and dust). \u2022 Is the bacterial count in air (CFU/m 3 ) satisfactory? \u2022 Beard is not recommended at work in a surgery department because of possible increased risk of infection. \u2022 The room for surgical hand washing is not storage for sterile/clean equipment.",

With a little moisture or transferred to the skin and mucous membranes, the bacteria start to grow again with fast propagation and doubling within 8-16 min.

It is measured greater amounts of MRSA in the air than on the surfaces in departments with patients infected with MRSA [45] . Air contamination is an important transmission route for the spread of MRSA. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) may have several resistance factors and can be transmitted to many other patients in departments with a high consumption of resistance-selecting antibiotics. A serious outbreak of gentamicin-resistant S. aureus occurred among premature at the neonatal intensive care unit, Ulleval University Hospital [46] . For a long period, there had been a high consumption of gentamicin as a standard treatment when suspected infection in the neonates. S. aureus isolated from the patients were regularly not tested for resistance against gentamicin [46] . The department was unaware of the resistance to gentamicin, selected out by gentamicin as routine treatment [46] . Children were infected with this gentamicin-resistant strain, causing sepsis and pulmonary infections, and the strain was also detected in several samples from the environment [46] .",
