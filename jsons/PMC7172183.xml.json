The importance of viruses as human pathogens is also well recognized.5 Although some handwash or handrub products, notably those containing a high proportion of alcohol, have demonstrated efficacy against many viruses in experimental settings,6 there is a general lack of effort to formulate hygienic handantiseptics against viruses, test them for their virus-eliminating potential, and an absence of suitable regulations to prepare and review label claims for such activity. When such products are tested for activity against viruses, it is often with inappropriate methodology and use of viruses that may be unsafe or irrelevant in hand antisepsis.7 It is also important to note that many marketed topical formulations are not more effective against viruses than unmedicated soap and water.8 However, little incentive exists for the development of improved virucidal antiseptics because of the lack of a means to register label claims for effective products. In contrast, general purpose disinfectants, which may be less important than hand antiseptics in intrepreting the spread of viral infections, can make label claims against viruses. It is difficult to know whether the major obstacle to more effective virucidal topicals is lack of regulations, the lack of demand for regulation by manufacturers or users, or both. Other complicating factors are the high cost of testing and the lack of accepted standard methods to examine virucidal activity of topicals.",

Perhaps 2 aspects that will require particular attention in this context are the level of virus-eliminating activity desired in topical agents, and which, if any, viruses should be used as surrogates for human pathogenic viruses. It is hoped that this critical analysis helps to clarify the topic and stimulate discussion. More information on this and related issues are summarized elsewhere.6, 10, 11\n",

In many developing countries, HAV is endemic and >90% of children may be infected by 6 years of age.64 In industrialized countries, improved sanitation and water supply have given rise to large pools of highly susceptible people, increasing the risk of massive common-source outbreaks. In young children HAV is frequently asymptomatic, but transmission to older age groups can result in clinically evident disease. The most common risk factor for HAV infection is contact with another infected person, often in a daycare setting. Food and waterborne outbreaks contribute only 1% to 5% of the total cases reported in any year.65 In all surveillance studies, no source was identified for 20% to 30% of HAV cases.65 The vehicles of transmission in foodborne outbreaks of HAV are most often prepared uncooked foods, such as sandwiches or salads, or foods touched by human hands after cooking.58\n",

However, recent studies on the detection of papillomavirus DNA on the hands of patients with genital warts suggested their potential for spread by hands.91, 92 The analyses of Fairley et al93 also suggests that hands may play a role in the spread of genital warts. Those who are immunocompromised are particularly prone to infections by papillomaviruses and develop numbers of warts on their hands.94 Such cases can also be quite refractory to treatment.94\n",

This presents a serious problem for infection control because viruses discharged by asymptomatic shedders could cause serious disease in others.

This is a complex issue and many factors need consideration, including the possibility that the young and immunocompromised, with their higher susceptibility to infections,34 may require more frequent use of germicidal products and, consequently, greater exposure to potentially harmful chemicals in them. The challenge for makers of topicals would be to develop safe but effective alternative virucides, and regulators would be challenged to ensure the proper evaluation of any label claims for virus inactivation or elimination.
