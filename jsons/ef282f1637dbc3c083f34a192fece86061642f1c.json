This philosophy is particularly pertinent in Aotearoa-New Zealand because of the country's relatively isolated island ecosystem, economic reliance on agriculture and its intensification, and existing indigenous worldview that emphasises holism and interconnectivity between humans, animals and the environment. In New Zealand, the One Health Aotearoa (OHA) alliance was established in order to better connect researchers and to address a growing number of infectious diseases challenges. The emphasis of OHA is to bring together and facilitate interactions between people from diverse disciplines, link to stakeholders and communities, and engage with policy-makers, government operational agencies, and funders, thus providing a holistic and integrative systems-thinking approach to address priority questions and achieve desired outcomes in One Health. The initial focus of OHA has been on infectious diseases, but there is increasing recognition of the potential benefits of the alliance to address broader complex issues. Greater involvement and overlap of the environmental sciences, human and animal health sciences, social science, and indigenous kaupapa M\u0101ori research is particularly critical for ensuring its success within the New Zealand context. Given the economic and cultural importance of New Zealand's \"clean, green\" image, a One Health approach that draws strongly on the environmental sciences makes particular sense. Furthermore, as the global environment becomes increasingly stressed by anthropogenic pressures our research may hold potential solutions for similar challenges elsewhere.",

OHA aims to be the national leader for research, education, and advocacy on health hazards at the human-animal-environmental interface, and to be the prime point of contact in New Zealand for engagement and collaboration in One Health. OHA is not simply a national One Health society, committee or interest group. The intention is to create a genuine culture change with the embedding of transdisciplinary thinking and action among researchers at a national level, running parallel with an indigenous worldview and with intrinsic and direct links to effective policymaking. We believe this initiative is novel globally because of these characteristics.",

Quarantine measures were implemented early during the period of European colonisation to protect public health and the agricultural sector. Today, New Zealand's biosecurity laws remain some of the strictest globally [3] . Consequently, New Zealand has relatively low rates of certain infections (e.g. bovine brucellosis has been eliminated and Q fever has never been reported), has the presence of strains rarely found elsewhere that arrived in the country many decades ago and have been evolving in isolation (e.g. Campylobacter [4] and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli [5] ), and experiences delayed impact of many infectious diseases from overseas [3] . One benefit of being a relatively \"closed system\" for some food and agricultural products is that the impact of health interventions can be evaluated in a more rigorous way that would not otherwise be possible. For example, campylobacteriosis rates were halved following an intervention that lowered contamination of fresh poultry [6] [7] [8] .",

New Zealand is experiencing some of the highest global rates of agricultural intensification [17] , with implications for water quality and disease profile. While the global biomass ration of livestock to humans is~2:1 [18] , in New Zealand it is~25:1 [19] . Agricultural intensification has been linked to water contamination [20] , which has been associated with New Zealand's high rates of zoonotic enteric disease [21] . Zoonoses associated with direct animal contact, such as Salmonella Brandenburg [22] and leptospirosis [23, 24] , disproportionately affect farmers and meat workers, and people living in rural areas with large cattle populations are more likely to be infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [25] . There is growing concern over the deteriorating quality of New Zealand's natural environment, particularly fresh water quality [26] . Routes of transmission to humans via contaminated water include through irrigation of food crops, recreational activities, M\u0101ori customary resources, consumption of contaminated shellfish, as well as through drinking water. New Zealand's disease profile at the human-animal-environmental interface is, therefore, likely to be different from many developed countries, characterised both by the need to deal with internal challenges and to resist external pressures from overseas. There is growing global focus on the health and environmental impacts of food production systems [27] . It is a challenge for a country that is so highly reliant on a narrow agricultural base to transition to a more sustainable and low risk agricultural system. Informing this transition may benefit from use of new, more comprehensive metrics that consider wider health, social, environmental, and economic impacts [28] .",

The New Zealand Microbiology Network connects all clinical diagnostic microbiology laboratories across the country and facilitated nationwide initiatives with relative ease, such as a national surveillance study for Legionnaires' disease [30] .

These diseases have multiple pathways of entry. For example, S. Typhimurium DT160 was linked to wild birds, pandemic influenza was introduced by human travellers, and M. bovis was most likely brought in by material from cattle [46] . Concerns about the potential to introduce mosquitoborne and other diseases not currently established in New Zealand are real [50] . Understanding external drivers of imported infectious diseases is essential for informing biosecurity measures and pandemic preparedness [51] . New Zealand's relative isolation may also provide opportunities to consider disease prevention options that are not available to larger, more connected geographical regions [52] .",
