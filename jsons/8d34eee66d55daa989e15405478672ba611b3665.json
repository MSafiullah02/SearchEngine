Immunological mechanisms leading to this type of food allergy are mainly based on IgE-mediated (Type I) hypersensitivity. but IgG-antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. immune complex mechanisms and cellular immune responses may also be involved {2. 3). The reported prevalence of CMA varies from ().3%-7.5%. probably due to differences in diagnostic criteria (4) (5) (6) . CMA is a disease of early infancy, and most infants develop first symptoms approximately I week after introduction of a cow's milk based formula. Onset before 1 month and after the age of 12 months is rare (1). The most commonly affected organ system in the first months of life is the gastrointestinal tract leading to vomiting, diarrhea, colic, malabsorption. colitis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Other clinical manifestations of CMA are localized in the respiratory tract (e.g.. bronchial obstruction) or skin (e.g.. atopic eczema, urticaria, angioedema) and occasionally anaphylactic reactions can occur (7) . Clinical symptoms may develop within a few minutes or up to 1 hour after exposure to cow's milk {\"immediate onset\") or later than ! hour (\"intermediate onset\") or even after some days (\"late onset\") (8) .",

Serological tests for infectious diseases including toxoplasmosis. rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, herpes simplex, hepatitis B and HIV-1 were negative. Because of clinical deterioration with dehydration and hypokalemia treatment with intravenous fluids was started on day 11 (see Fig. 1 ). An allergy was suspected in view of a markedly increased total IgE {208 kU/1) as well as the detection of specific IgE-antibodies to cow's milk protein (13.6 kU/1: CAP class 3) both analyzed on day 14. Consequently, enteral nutrition with an extensively hydrolyzed casein-formula (Nutramigen\"^) and breast feeding was started on day 16. The mother was advised to minimize the intake of dairy products and avoid ftsh and eggs in her diet during lactation.

Coagulation disorders were excluded by laboratory tests and clinical examination, the absence of peritoneal signs and the clinical course argues against a vascular disorder as a cause of the gastrointestinal bleeding. Infectious causes were unlikely, because of negative stool cultures for common viral and bacterial pathogens as well as negative serological fmdings. A marked eosinophilia in the differential blood count was noted on the first day of life and furthermore an increased total IgE as well as specific IgE-antibodies to cow's milk protein could be demonstrated as early as on day 14. The eosinophilia and the specific IgE to cow's milk protein in conjunction with the repeated positive oral challenges with cow's milk formula indicate that a cow's milk allergy may have been the cause of the symptoms in this newborn. In addition, the clinical course with subsequent tolerance to cow's milk exclude an inborn lactose intolerance as an etiologic factor in the disease. Additional other factors sueh as unknown infections, or vascular disorders are very unlikely, although they cannot be completely ruled out.",

Our case may represent the first report of a manifestation of CMA directly after delivery. From our observation the following inferences can be made: sensitization must have occurred In utero due to either cow's milk antigen present in the amniotic fluid or antigen crossing the placenta to elicit an allergic response in the fetus. Intrauterine sensitization to food allergens has been described by Kuroume et al. (12) . The mechanism, however, remains obscure. One hypothesis may be that in utero oral intake of cow's milk proteins presumably present in the amniotic fiuid has led to an early intestinal manifestation of CMA. This may indicate that the fetus is able to exhibit an allergic response in the gastrointestinal tract even before oral intake.",
