If the U wave is sufficiently separated from the end of the T wave, the QT interval can be measured without difficulty as described (excluding the U wave). Conversely, when the U wave is inscribed at the end of the T wave, it is difficult to differentiate it from notched T waves, affecting the accuracy of the QT measurement. The notched T wave is recognized by the presence of two waves of the same amplitude that are fused without return to the baseline (Fig. 3). In these cases, the QT measurement should be done to the point where the downward inscription of the second wave crosses the baseline (Fig. 3). In cases where the T wave has two components but the second one is much smaller in amplitude than the first, it is difficult to differentiate whether that is a notched T wave or U wave inscribed at the end of the T wave. In the latter case, it is suggested to measure the QT interval from the start of the QRS to the nadir between the two components (where they merge) and also report the QTU interval measured to the point at which the second component crosses the baseline (Fig. 3).",

A single-center retrospective study compared the available formulae in a hospital population of patients older than 19 years that were in sinus rhythm, which showed narrow QRS and a heart rate < 90 bpm. The Fridericia and Framingham formulae showed better rate correction and improved prediction of 30-day and 1-year mortality when compared with the Bazett formula that seemed to overestimate the QTc. However, those formulae have not been prospectively compared in a wider population with abnormal heart rhythms or ventricular conduction defects. In any case, the intra-individual changes comparing control with basal QTc after the first doses of a QT prolonging medication are of key importance to identify patients in risk for \u201ctorsade de pointes\u201d/ventricular fibrillation associated with pathologic prolongation of the QT interval (called \u201cQTc reactors\u201d by Giudicessi et al.).",

In these cases, the QTc must be adjusted to the QRS duration using the following formula: [QTc adjusted to QRS width = QTc \u2212 (QRS \u2212 100 ms)]. For example, if the QRS is 180 ms, 180\u2013100 = 80 ms and these 80 ms are subtracted from the conventionally measured QTc value which for the example would be 520 ms. In this way, the final value of QTc adjusted to the duration of the QRS would be 520\u201380 ms = 440 ms, in reference to which the therapeutic decision should be made.",

            "text": "We have adapted for this document the algorithm proposed by the Mayo Clinic with the aim of serving as a practical guide for the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in COVID-19 infection with respect to the behavior of QT and the presence of risk factors that prolong it. It should be noted that the indication for the use of these medicines should be defined depending on the protocols formulated by international and local regulatory entities [11], as well as by each institution. Depending on future changes in the indications for their use, as well as the experience gained from their safety profile during the pandemic, the proposed algorithms may be modified. Special updates should be expected regarding indications for outpatient initiation vs. intrahospital administration of these drugs and the type of electrocardiographic monitoring with which the QT should be measured before and during administration (12 lead ECG, continuous telemetry, devices for remote monitoring [12] or without indication for follow-up measurement).Once it is decided that the patient has an indication for the use of these drugs, it is suggested that a baseline checklist is followed that includes:QTc measurementBaseline evaluation of serum electrolytesInterruption of other nonessential drugs that can also prolong the QT (https://www.crediblemeds.org/)Identification of risk factors associated with QT prolongation (Table 1).The identification and correction, if possible, of risk factors for inducible QT prolongation are essential to prevent \u201ctorsade de pointes\u201d/ventricular fibrillation appearance. Those risk factors have been included by Tislade et al. in a risk score to predict QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients that also could be used to guide the administration of COVID medications (Table 2).The QTc interval measurement can be done on the 12-lead surface ECG as described in the previous paragraphs. However, taking ECG as standard can increase the risk of contact contagion for patients, health workers, and their families. For this reason and in accordance with local regulations, QTc measurement can be done in telemetry ECG leads (one or more) during continuous monitoring in hospitalized patients or by mobile systems according to their local availability and regulation.If the baseline QTc is below the 99th percentile for gender and age (highlighted in green in the algorithm), the COVID-19 medicines may be started.Quickly, if the QT interval measured in 12-lead ECG or a telemetry or mobile device is less than half of the preceding RR interval, the calculated QTc will always be < 460 ms, and therefore, it is safe to start the drug for COVID-19.In patients with QTc \u2265 500 ms (highlighted in red in the algorithm), initiation of these medications should be decided according to a balance between the expected benefit (risk of onset/progression of acute respiratory failure) and the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation (depends on the QTc value in addition to the presence of risk factors).In addition to the points suggested on the initial checklist, continuous monitoring of the patient\u2019s rhythm in units with immediate defibrillation capacity is suggested, due to increased risk of malignant arrhythmias.In these patients with baseline QTc \u2265 500 ms, hydroxychloroquine use alone is suggested thus avoiding concomitant use of azithromycin.In the presence of TdP/VF, all medicines associated with QT prolongation should be discontinued.In patients with baseline QT < 500 ms but increased to \u2265 500 ms or in whom the QTc delta (QTc control minus baseline QTc) is \u226560 ms after combined use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, suspension of the latter drug is suggested.The frequency with which QTc should be measured will depend on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, baseline QTc, and associated risk of TdP/VF and the method used for ECG monitoring and the consequent risk of contagion during evaluation (Fig. 4). Of note, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has approved the use of KardiaMobile 6 L (AliveCore) to monitor the QTc duration in COVID-19 patients receiving QT-prolonging drugs. This avoids exposure of ECG technicians to affected patients and unnecessary use of PPE.",
