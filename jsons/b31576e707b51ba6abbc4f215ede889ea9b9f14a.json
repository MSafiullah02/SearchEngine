Most Cheetahs in zoos in those days were short lived because of improper diet and inadequate housing. It was not until 1956 that Philadelphia Zoo first bred the species in North America. However, the first few litters born in captivity failed to survive and it was not until 1970 that San Diego Zoo became the first zoo in North America to rear Cheetahs successfully.",

This coincided with the work of Eaton (1974) , Schaller (1972 ) and, later, Frame & Frame (1981 , who believed that wild Cheetahs avoided other predators by living away from them; in captivity, close proximity may reduce the chances of successful breeding. Increased importations of wildcaught Cheetahs from South Africa and housing the animals away from other large carnivores appeared to increase reproduction in captivity. The Cheetah population in North America peaked in the late 1970s but began to decrease in the early 1980s (Marker & O'Brien, 1989) and this decrease in reproduction caused much concern. At about this time it was documented that captive Cheetahs were depauperate of genetic variation (O'Brien et al., 1983 (O'Brien et al., , 1986 which could make them more susceptible to disease. In the early 1980s an outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) at Wildlife Safari, Winston, caused another major concern to managers and veterinarians (Evermann et al., 1984 (Evermann et al., , 1989 .",

Two of the goals of the SSP were to increase reproduction of Cheetahs in captivity and to facilitate the exchange of information about the species between all participating institutions. The Cheetah SSP Husbandry Manual (Grisham, 1987) gave an overview of the existing facilities, diets and management programmes. No single management style was used at the collections which had bred Cheetahs and successful reproduction appeared to be the result of using a variety of methods to stimulate the animals to breed.",

As a consequence, the standard SSP Master Plan, which would entail genetic and demographic management of the species, would have been premature. In 1988, Cheetahs in the North American SSP were declared a research population and an extensive Research Master Plan was developed (Grisham & Lindburg, 1988) . This programme comprised a systematic and co-ordinated effort to determine the reproduction and mortality problems facing this species. The purpose of this research was to increase fecundity, reduce mortality and develop a self-sustaining population that could be managed as a back-up to the wild population. Eminent scientists were recruited to develop specific research hypotheses, projects and protocols to investigate concerns about reproduction and physiology, nutrition, behaviour, mortality, genetics and infectious disease in the captive population. The goal was to gather baseline data which could be used to develop protocols for the long-term conservation of Cheetahs in zoos.",
