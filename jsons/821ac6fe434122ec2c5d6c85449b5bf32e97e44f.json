            "text": "The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID- 19) has recently been designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 The disease is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), 1 a member of the pathogenic coronaviridae family, which includes enveloped positive sense single stranded ribonucleic acid (+ssRNA) viruses typically responsible for a spectrum of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. 1 Confirmed disease has afflicted 2.7 million patients globally as of April 25, 2020 with an associated mortality of 187,700 (7.0%). 2 SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to SARS-CoV-1, with a genetic homology of 76.9%. 3 Though coronaviruses predominantly cause enteric and respiratory illness, members of coronaviridae have a demonstrated ability to produce neuromuscular and neurological symptoms. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Experimental and clinical studies suggest brainstem involvement and the potential for trans-neuronal virus transmission in addition to misdirected host immune responses. [10] [11] [12] [13] The exact mechanisms, however, for clinical neurological disease secondary to coronavirus infection remain unclear. Recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is similarly capable of causing severe neurological disease, [14] [15] [16] including meningoencephalitis, various viral associated necrotizing encephalitides that are similar to influenza associated encephalopathy (IAE), and secondary cytokine induced acute necrotizing syndromes seen with hemagglutinin 1 neuraminidase 1 influenza virus (H1N1). [14] [15] [16] These findings highlight the dramatic impact on daily healthcare delivery during this pandemic, [17] [18] [19] [20] making COVID-19 an additional challenge in clinical neuroscience. This review consolidates the current body of knowledge on the coronaviruses with a focus on the nervous system, discusses the reported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, and highlights recommendations for patient management.

General terms included \"coronavirus\", \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"SARS-CoV\", \"MERS\", and \"COVID-19\". These terms were used in combination with the terms \"neurology\", \"neurological\", and \"neurosurgery\" to identify case reports, retrospective studies, and articles on nervous system pathophysiology. Additional searches with the terms \"management\", \"guidelines\", \"spine\", \"stroke\", \"trauma\", \"brain tumors\", \"transnasal\", and \"pediatrics\" were used to identify articles with guidelines or recommendations for providers. The authors screened for relevant articles based on title and abstract. Additional relevant articles were identified from the review of citations referenced. The included number of articles by subject was as follows: 27 that described pathophysiology, 18 that discussed guidelines for providers, 18 that presented or analyzed retrospective studies, 5 that included 6 case reports of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, and 4 that provided general information concerning disease history or epidemiology.",

            "text": "Early prospective evidence from the presumptive origin of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province in the People's Republic of China, reported that the first 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 had pre-existing diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) (20%), hypertension (15%), and cardiovascular disease (15%). 21 Expansion of this cohort to include an additional 162 confirmed cases in a subsequent, retrospective, multicenter study demonstrated the unique finding that increased age was significantly associated with greater odds of mortality for every additional year of patient age. 22 This finding is supported by trends reported in other populations that suggest COVID-19 disproportionately affects the elderly and is not consistent with bimodal patterns of age distribution typical of moderate to severe viral disease. 23, 24 A systematic review and meta-analysis performed by Wang et al. that evaluated 1,558 COVID-19 positive patients across six studies 21,25-29 further identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cerebrovascular disease as significantly associated comorbidities. 30 Further studies identified obesity and kidney disease as potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and predictors of COVID-19 severity. [31] [32] [33] [34] Since many of these comorbidities are seen in patients undergoing treatment for neurological conditions, particularly obese patients with ischemic occlusive and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease, neurological and neurosurgical patients at increased risk. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] It is intuitive that severe pulmonary dysfunction via acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) would exacerbate preexisting systemic disease via increased intrapulmonary shunting, decreased alveolar recruitment, increased pulmonary resistance, and hypoxemia. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Furthermore, a pre-existing history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke has been demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for the development of ARDS in a neurointensive setting [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] and therefore it becomes critical to differentiate direct viral injury from systemic pathophysiology.",

            "text": "The majority of available knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology has been derived from literature regarding SARS-CoV-1. 32 Both viruses have been shown to enter lower respiratory epithelium via a spike protein (encoded by the viral S gene) attachment to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2R). [32] [33] [34] Although there is less than 75% similarity between the S gene in the two viruses and the receptor-binding domain is well conserved, SARS-CoV-2 S still provides a significant increase in receptor affinity. 3, [32] [33] [34] Early reports recommended avoidance of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) due to a presumed increase in available binding sites as a result of decreased functional competitive inhibition. 35 However, these agents have not been shown to increase ACE2R density and preliminary studies have shown that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may actually confer benefit. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] While ACE2R is found primarily in lung alveolar epithelium, 40 it is present on the surface of central nervous system (CNS) neurons, which suggests potential neurotropism. 41 SARS-CoV-2 may enter the CNS either directly from contiguous spread from nasopharyngeal mucosa through the cribriform plate or hematogenously secondary to viremia, 42 as both upper airway epithelium and vascular endothelium express ACE2R. 40 An axodendritic trans-synaptic route has been reported as a potential mechanism for CNS dissemination. 10, 43 Rodent models infected with intranasal SARS-CoV-1 have demonstrated particular tropism for the cerebrum, thalamus, and rhombencephalon derivatives typical of viral encephalitis. 44 While coronaviridae CNS entry is well documented, the role in neurological disease remains under investigation. 45, 46 Reports implicate potential central involvement of respiratory failure compounding primary pulmonary injury via direct infection of the pontine and medullary respiratory centers by COVID-19. 10 With a median symptom onset of 8 days for the development of ARDS, SARS-CoV-2 CNS involvement is possible by the time of intensive care (ICU) admission, strengthening the consideration of a mixed central and peripheral etiology of pulmonary compromise. 25 Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may incite non-inflammatory encephalopathy, which has been previously implicated in SARS-CoV-1 infection. 47 Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-1 include seizure, generalized polyneuropathy, mixed axonal neuropathy, and primary myopathy. 7, 48, 49 Tsai et al. noted that while the neuromuscular disorders were considered secondary to critical illness, there remained evidence for direct viral injury of motor units. 49 Similarly, in MERS, viral associated encephalopathy has been reported with confusion, coma, ataxia, and focal motor deficits. 9 An early retrospective series from clusters in Wuhan reported associated clinical CNS involvement in 36.4% of COVID-19 cases throughout disease course increasing to 45.5% in severe disease. 50 Mild CNS involvement entailed dizziness (16.8%), headache (13.1%), ataxia (0.5%), hypogeusia (5.6%), and hyposmia (5.1%), and peripheral symptoms such as neuralgia (2.3%). 50 Severe neuromuscular and CNS manifestations included skeletal muscle injury (10.7%), acute cerebrovascular disease (2.8%), and epilepsy (0.5%). 50 An additional observational series by Helms et al. showed that 84% of their patients had neurologic signs: confusion (65%), agitation (69%), corticospinal tract signs (67%), and dysexecutive syndrome (36%). 51 Eight of 13 (62%) patients that underwent brain MRI showed leptomeningeal enhancement. 51 It is difficult to differentiate symptoms due to primary viral injury from secondary systemic involvement characteristic in an ICU setting. 50.51 As with all critically ill patients, it is vital that intensivists and primary care physicians monitor for neurological manifestations of COVID-19, as they may indicate and potentially precede progression to severe disease.
