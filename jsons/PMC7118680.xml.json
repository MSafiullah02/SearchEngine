During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, relevant You tube videos were watched millions of times [7]. Similar viewership was reported during the 2016 Zika virus epidemic [8]. Such formidable viewership makes YouTube a double-edged sword in times of disease outbreaks. While appropriate YouTube content may benefit the government agencies and health care organizations in allaying public anxiety and enforcing measures to control the spread of disease, dissemination of wrong information can lead to public paranoia and failure to contain the infection [9].",

The objectives of our study were (i) to analyze the quality of the information available on YouTube about current nCoV outbreak (ii) to compare the English language content with the information available in Chinese Mandarin henceforth mentioned as Mandarin. It is the most widely spoken language in Asia and official language of China. The current n-CoV epidemic has affected the Asia Pacific region more than the West. We think that it is therefore important to review the available content in Mandarin.",

This score allocates one point each for clarity, reliable source of information, lack of bias, reference supplementation and mention of uncertainty (Table 1\n). A maximum score of 5 indicates highest reliability for a particular video. For evaluating the content, we used medical information and content index (MICI) as previously defined by Nagpal et al. during the Ebola epidemic [7]. This scale uses a 5 point Likert scale to assess five components of medical information included in the videos: prevalence, transmission, clinical symptoms, screening/testing, and treatment/outcomes of the disease. The study team devised set of criterion to be used for grading each component of MICI score on a scale of 1\u20135. For example a video would be scored 5 for the treatment/outcome component if it mentions all of the following: the symptoms can be self-resolving but some cases can become dangerously ill requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit, disease can lead to death, treatment is mainly supportive, vaccinations not yet available. The full list of criterion is available as Supplementary Table 1. The kappa coefficient of agreement was used to determine degree of agreement between the two researchers.",

This is evident by the much higher number of mean views/day of the useful videos in our study. This can be partly explained by the fact that we performed this analysis early in the course of disease evolution. The mean number of days since upload on YouTube for useful videos was 6 in our study compared to 61 days as reported by Pathak et al. during the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak. It has been reported that the viewership of videos tends to decrease over time and that could lead to higher number of views/day in the initial days of video upload. Regardless, the difference is substantial and high viewership of content in our study should be considered as a reflection of growing popularity of YouTube for health related information. The higher number of views can also be explained by the global spread of this disease compared to previous outbreaks like Ebola which was mainly restricted to Africa.",

The lower percentage of misleading videos in our study can be explained by the difference in source of these videos compared to previous studies. Individual users accounted for only 11% of total videos while news agencies contributed 68%. This is not surprising given the global nature and rapid spread of this outbreak.

The mean DISCERN scores were similar in 2 groups indicating comparable reliability. Similarly, comparable but very low mean total MICI scores were noted in both groups, suggesting overall paucity of good quality scientific information on n-CoV outbreak.

We did not analyze other video sharing platforms such as health sharing websites or news channel websites. In addition, YouTube is not accessible from China. Instead, a platform called Youku is used for video sharing. This affects the applicability of results in China which is the epicentre of this disease outbreak. Restriction of YouTube in China also explains the relative lesser number of views of Mandarin language videos compared to those in English. Nonetheless, Mandarin remains the widest spoken language in Asia Pacific region and videos in this language serve as an important source of information to native Mandarin speakers in this region.

The Mandarin term for 2019 novel coronavirus \u20182019 \u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u2019 showed only 380000 videos compared to 58100000 videos identified with the term \u2018\u6b66\u6c49\u75c5\u6bd2\u2019 which means Wuhan virus in Mandarin.
