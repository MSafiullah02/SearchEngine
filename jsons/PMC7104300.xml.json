            "text": "Selenium (Se) is a trace element required for selenoprotein enzymatic function [1]. Selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase have antioxidant functions and play a key role in intracellular defenses by reducing reactive oxygen species [2]. They also play a role in immune responses [3]. Thus, dietary deficiencies in Se and other trace elements negatively affect the course of several viral infections, especially in the tropics, such as HIV, emerging influenza viruses, coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome), Ebola virus and measles [4]. In industrialized countries, Se serum levels have been studied during acute gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, chickenpox, and meningitis but, to our knowledge, never during measles [5], [6]. The aim of this study was to determine serum Se concentrations in French patients with acute measles and to seek correlations with clinical and virological findings.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, serum Se concentrations have not previously been studied in Europe during the acute phase of measles. The role of Se in human health was highlighted in a 9-year prospective study of French individuals aged from 59 to 71 years, in which baseline plasma Se concentrations were significantly lower among subjects who died during follow-up than among survivors (77.6 \u00b1 15.3 \u03bcg/L versus 84.6 \u00b1 15.3 \u03bcg/L) [7]. It is interesting to note that Se concentrations in survivors in this study were similar to those observed in our healthy controls (86.5 \u00b1 13.9 \u03bcg/L; range: 52\u2013118 \u03bcg/L) but nonetheless lower than the values (96\u2013122 \u03bcg/L) recommended to ensure optimal functioning of selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase suggesting that dietary Se intake is inadequate in the French general population [1], [3], [7]. It is thus likely that Se concentrations in our measles patients (46.4 \u00b1 14.1 \u03bcg/L) significantly lower than in controls were probably already low at disease onset, although none of them had signs of poor nutrition. As Se is involved in CD4+ T-cell differentiation into Th-1 cells essential for viral clearance [2], the very low Se levels observed in measles patients due to a strong mobilization of this trace element could be responsible for a potential deficit of the antiviral immune response. It should be noted that inadequate Se intake adversely affects the T-cell cytokine profile and in some situations, viruses like coxsackievirus B3 may become more virulent under low Se status in the infected host leading to Keshan disease, a myocarditis mainly occurring in regions of China with low soil Se [8]; in this case, Se supplementation has been particularly effective as a preventive measure for Keshan disease [2]. However, no association between Se concentrations and demographic or clinical features was found in our work. In particular, patients with complications (diarrhea or pneumonia) did not have lower Se levels than patients with rapidly favorable evolution of the disease. Paradoxically, in the 30\u201339-year age group of our study, Se concentrations were even higher among patients with pneumonia than among those who did not develop complications. Overall, these intriguing data that did not show association between low Se levels and pejorative outcome of the disease, suggest still unknown compensating mechanisms in patients from developed countries as other micronutrients involvement such as zinc or copper in immune mechanisms against the disease.",
