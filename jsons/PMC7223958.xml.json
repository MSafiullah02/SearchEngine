            "text": "The general use of mobile phone communications results in partial or whole-body exposures to electromagnetic field (EMF). Since the 1990s, these communications use pulse-modulated signals, among which is the global system for mobile communication (GSM) operating in the 900-MHz or 1800-MHz bands. Concerns about possible health hazard resulting from these EMF exposures have generated a wealth of investigation, many of which aimed at determining the impact of EMF at cellular or molecular levels (Narayanan et al. 2019). This issue was approached experimentally using cell cultures or animals that were submitted to calibrated exposures to EMF (Gherardini et al. 2014; Marino et al. 2011; McNamee and Chauhan 2009). Mobile phone communications commonly bring a source of EMF in contact with the ear, which favors the exposure of brain cells to EMF. Studies carried out with rodents have searched for effects of GSM-related EMF in brain cells, such as changes in the expression of genes involved in cell stress responses or that mark brain tissue alterations. For instance, investigations have focused on the expression of heat shock proteins (Fritze et al. 1997; Miyakoshi et al. 2005; Watilliaux et al. 2011), immediate early genes including Fos (Finnie 2005), synaptic components (Kim et al. 2017), astroglial GFAP marker, or proinflammatory mediators (Bouji et al. 2012; Hirose et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2014; Su et al. 2018; Thorlin et al. 2006). However, gene responses to GSM-EMF were inconstant from one study to another. In particular, astroglial reactions marked by increased expression of GFAP were observed in response to a unique head-only exposure to GSM-900 MHz (Brillaud et al. 2007; Mausset-Bonnefont et al. 2004), but was not observed in other studies using either single head-only exposures (Bouji et al. 2012; Fritze et al. 1997; Watilliaux et al. 2011) or repeated head- or whole-body exposures (Court-Kowalski et al. 2015; Petitdant et al. 2016). The reasons for such discrepancies remain unclear but can result from differences in experimental setting used in the different studies. Key parameters include the number, duration, and the power of EMF exposures absorbed by the tissues, which is determined by the specific absorption rate (SAR) expressed in W/kg.",

Two of these studies (McNamee et al. 2016; Paparini et al. 2008) have carried out their microarray analyses using statistical procedures incorporating an appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple comparison testing. Under these stringent conditions, Paparini et al. (2008) could not detect any EMF-induced modulation of gene expression assessed in the whole brain of mice after a 1-h whole-body exposure at an average whole-body SAR value of 1.1 W/kg. Also, McNamee et al. (2016) found no significant gene responses to EMF in different brain regions that were analyzed following 4-h daily whole-body exposures repeated for 5 days at (whole-body) average SAR values up to 1.45 W/kg. In both studies, the relevance of FDR adjustments was emphasized, by showing that gene responses detected in the absence of FDR adjustment could not be confirmed in semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses.",

However, recent investigations indicate that exposure to EMF influences preexisting neuropathological processes. In a rat model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine treatment, proconvulsive activity of pilocarpine and its stimulating effect on Fos gene expression were enhanced when animals were submitted to a single whole-body exposure to GSM-900 MHz at an average SAR of 0.15 W/kg (Lopez-Martin et al. 2006). In transgenic mice modeling human Alzheimer diseases, chronic whole-body exposures to pulsed 918 MHz EMF (estimated SAR between 0.25 and 1.05 W/kg) or 1950 MHz (average SAR of 5 W/kg) could alleviate the neurodegenerative process, as indicated by improvement in cognitive behaviors and brain mitochondrial function, or reduction in reactive gliosis and \u00df-amyloid deposits (Arendash et al. 2010; Dragicevic et al. 2011; Jeong et al. 2015; Son et al. 2018). Glioblastoma-bearing rats submitted to daily head exposures to GSM 900 MHz, over a month (brain-averaged SAR of 0.5 W/kg), showed reductions in the numbers of apoptotic tumor cell and infiltrating immune cells albeit with no impact on animal survival (Ouadah et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Transient neuroinflammation associated to a sickness syndrome is most frequently observed in human populations, as a consequence of peripheral immune challenges triggered by an acute infection (Dantzer et al. 2008). This pathological condition is mimicked in rodents by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection (Dantzer 2001; Hoogland et al. 2015). Investigating brain cell responses triggered by RF in LPS-treated rats, we previously reported that a single 2-h head-only exposure to GSM-1800 MHz led to alterations in the neuroinflammatory process (Lameth et al. 2017; Occelli et al. 2018). These alterations involved modifications in the morphologies of proinflammatory effector cells such as microglia and reduced expression of the interleukin-1\u00df (Il1\u00df) gene. The effect could be detected as late as 24 h after the GSM exposure in the dorso-medial cerebral cortex where the average SAR value was estimated as 2.94 W/kg. GSM signals also impacted on the evoked activity of cortical neurons and neurotransmission, as indicated by the reduction of action potential emission evoked by sounds in the auditory cortex (Occelli et al. 2018) and by reduced phosphorylation of glutamatergic ionotropic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5 methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) (Lameth et al. 2017). Importantly, these GSM-1800 MHz cell responses were not observed in the brain of healthy rats that were submitted to the same head-only exposure, indicating that the brain cell response to GSM signals was promoted by the LPS-induced neuroinflammation.",

In the present study, we performed whole genome mRNA profiling of the cerebral cortex to further determine cortical gene responses to a single head-only exposure to GSM-1800 MHz, in the context of an acute neuroinflammation triggered by LPS. To get further insight into the effect of GSM-1800 MHz according to neuroinflammatory conditions, we also investigated the cortical gene response to the EMF in genetically modified rats expressing a mutated form of human (h) SOD1 gene (G93A mutation, hSOD1G93A) (Howland et al. 2002). The mutation is responsible for inherited human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons associated with chronic inflammation in the spinal cord, the brainstem, and in the cerebral cortex (Al-Chalabi et al. 2017). Rodent expressing mutated hSOD1 are well-established models of human ALS (Philips and Rothstein 2015). They were used to uncover the role of neuroinflammation in the degeneration of motor neurons (Beers et al. 2006; Boillee et al. 2006; Chiot et al. 2019; Mesci et al. 2015) and to investigate how the progression of the disease could be affected by environmental factors, including extremely low-frequency EMF (Blacher et al. 2019; Poulletier de Gannes et al. 2009). A recent epidemiological study provides evidence for increased risk of ALS in association to exposure to RF emitted by GSM antennas (Luna et al. 2019).",

Briefly, a radiofrequency generator emitting a GSM electromagnetic field (RFPA, 1/8 duty factor) pulsed at 217 Hz (pulse emission every 4.6 ms for 546 \u03bcs) was connected to a four-output divider, allowing simultaneous exposure of four animals. Each output was connected to a loop antenna (Sama-Sistemi srl; Roma) enabling local exposure of the animal\u2019s head. The loop antenna consisted of a printed circuit, with two metallic lines engraved in a dielectric epoxy resin substrate (dielectric constant \u03b5r = 4.6). At one end, this device consisted of a 1-mm-wide line forming a loop placed close to the animals\u2019 head. As in previous studies (Lameth et al. 2017; Watilliaux et al. 2011), the incident power of the GSM signals was set to 0.2 W and specific absorption rates (SARs) were determined numerically using a numerical rat model with the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method (Yee 1966; Kunz and Luebbers 1993; Taflove 1995; Leveque et al. 2004). They were also determined experimentally in homogeneous rat model using a Vitek or Luxtron probe for measurement of temperature variation (Collin et al. 2016). In this case, SARs, expressed in W/kg, were calculated using the following equation: SAR = C\u0394T / \u0394t with C being the calorific capacity in J/(kg K), \u0394T the temperature change in \u00b0K, and \u0394t the time in seconds. Numerically determined SAR values were compared with experimental SAR values obtained using homogenous models, especially in the equivalent rat brain area. The difference between the numerical SAR determinations and the experimentally detected SAR values was less than 30%.",

Reads were mapped using STARv2.4.0 (Dobin et al. 2013) on the rn6 rat genome assembly. Gene expression regulation study was performed as already described (Noli et al. 2015). Briefly, for each gene present in the Rat FAST DB v2016_1 annotations, reads aligning on constitutive regions (that are not prone to alternative splicing) were counted. Based on these read counts, normalization and differential gene expression were performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) on R (v.3.2.5). Only genes expressed in at least one of the two compared experimental conditions were further analyzed. Genes were considered as expressed if their rpkm value was greater than 90% of the background rpkm value based on intergenic regions. Results were considered statistically significant for adjusted p values \u2264 0.05 and fold changes \u2265 1.2. Clusterings have been performed using \u201cdist\u201d and \u201chclust\u201d functions in R, using Euclidean distance and ward agglomeration method. Analyses for enriched gene ontology (GO) terms were performed using DAVID Functional Annotation Tool (v6.8). GO terms and pathways were considered as enriched if fold enrichment \u2265 2.0, uncorrected p value \u2264 0.05, and minimum number of regulated genes in pathway/term \u2265 2.0. Analysis was performed three times: using all regulated genes, using upregulated genes, and using downregulated genes only. Union of these three analyses was made to provide a single list of results.",

Based on previous evidence of gene responses in the dorso-medial region of the cerebral cortex (Lameth et al. 2017), we focused our investigation on an area of this brain region in which SAR values were maximal, making the assumption that local gene responses increase with local SAR values. Important for our study, this area corresponded to a sub region of the motor cerebral cortex (mCx, Fig. 1b) that is affected not only by LPS-triggered neuroinflammation but also in ALS. Dosimetric analyses showed that the mean SAR value reached 3.22 W/kg in the mCx that was selected for a whole genome mRNA analysis. Considering that altered molecular signaling could be observed 1 day after the GSM exposure (Lameth et al. 2017) and to determine gene responses that did not fade out within a few hours, gene expressions were assessed 24 h after the end of the GSM (n = 6 rats) or sham (n = 7) exposure, by means of RNA-seq analyses. We detected the expression of up to 11,971 genes including 10,476 annotated and 1495 unknown genes in this cortical area. Differential gene expression of LPS-treated/GSM-1800 MHz exposed rats relative to the LPS/sham control\u2013exposed group was carried out applying a fold change (FC) cutoff of 1.2. Statistical analyses using an FDR-adjusted p value cutoff (p \u2264 0.05) showed that among the 11,971 expressed genes, a total of 321 genes were differentially expressed between GSM- and sham-exposed animals (Fig. 2a). FC values did not exceed 1.89 and averaged 1.29. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these RNA-seq data confirmed RF-induced modulations of the transcriptome, showing segregation without overlap between the sham and exposed groups (Fig. 2b). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) consisted in 272 upregulated and 49 downregulated genes in response to the GSM exposure (Fig. 2a). Unknown genes were over-represented in the upregulated genes (42%, 115 unknown versus 157 annotated genes), whereas all but one (48) of the downregulated genes were annotated (Table 2).",

To gain insight into how these different cell types contributed to the gene response to RF, the cellular distribution of DEG was analyzed using gene expression databases established from defined cell types or single cells derived from the mouse cerebral cortex (Zhang et al. 2014; Zeisel et al. 2015). Part of the DEGs appeared to be preferentially or selectively expressed in glia or in glial subtypes, among which Adamts4 (oligodendrocytes), Clu (astrocytes), Litaf (oligodendrocytes, microglia), and Fam107a (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), whereas other genes including Micu3, Crlf1, and Ppp4r3a were expressed in neurons or in both neurons and glia. Although microglia account for less than 15% of the cortical non-neuronal cells (Ling and Leblond 1973), Parvg, a gene selectively and strongly expressed by microglia, was identified as a DEG whose expression was reduced in response to RF exposure. Akna, another microglia-expressed gene, was also affected by RF exposure. These genes were selected to verify, by RT-qPCR, the effect of RF on the level of transcripts. RT-qPCR analyses of the mCx from sham or GSM-exposed animals confirmed that the levels of transcripts from the selected genes were significantly enhanced or reduced as in our RNA-seq analysis, in response to the GSM exposure (Fig. 4a). Consistent with the range of FC values determined in RNA-seq analyses (Fig. 2a, Table 2), the optimal RF effect detected in RT-qPCR analyses corresponded to Micu3 gene (Fig. 4a).",

In the current study carried out with 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats, the expression of Il1\u00df or Ccl5 genes assessed in the mCx 48 h after LPS injection (e.g., 24 h after sham or GSM exposure) had already dropped to a level that precluded quantification in our RNA-seq analysis. However performing RT-qPCR, we could detect Il1\u00df and Ccl5 transcripts in the mCx of both sham and GSM-exposed rats and we found that GSM exposure resulted in significant reduction in the abundance of these transcripts, whereas the EMF had no effect on the local expression of other proinflammatory genes encoding Tnf-alpha or enzymes catalyzing the production of bioactive lipids or oxygen free radicals (Nox2, Nos2, Cox2) (Fig. 5a).

Focusing on a motor area of the dorso-medial cerebral cortex in which the mean SAR value was 3.22 W/kg, our RNA-seq analysis specifies the extent of the gene response assessed 24 h after the end exposure. Applying a FC threshold of 1.2, significant changes were limited to 2.7% of the expressed genes detected in our RNA-seq analysis. The EMF-induced gene modulations were moderated considering that all FC values were < 2. However, GO analyses uncovered potential modifications in biological processes that impact on proteostasis and intracellular signaling. The most significant modification (p < 0.005) corresponded to GO terms related to protein ubiquitination including proteasome-dependent catabolic processes. Ubiquitination is a multistep posttranslational modification that involves an enzymatic cascade leading to the attachment of a 15-kd ubiquitin peptide or polyubiquitin chains to lysine residues of protein substrates. According to the residues involved in ubiquitin-to-ubiquitin linkages, polyubiquitin chains act as proteolytic signal by targeting substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation, or control other processes like protein interaction signaling, endocytosis of membrane receptors, or DNA repair (Chen and Sun 2009; Swatek and Komander 2016). Our study reveals GSM-induced upregulation of several genes encoding E3 ubiquitin ligases or components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that catalyze the final step of protein ubiquitination and determine the specificity of ubiquitinated substrates (Zheng and Shabek 2017). We also found enhanced expression of transcripts encoding two ubiquitin-specific proteases (Table 2), including USP14 that suppresses protein degradation through deubiquitination of proteasome substrates, non-catalytic inhibition of proteasome activity, and by regulating autophagy (de Poot et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2016).",

In keeping with this hypothesis, we previously found (Lameth et al. 2017) that in LPS-treated rats, a same head exposure to GSM 1800 MHz impacted on glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission, as indicated by a reduced phosphorylation of serine residues (Ser 845 and 831) in the gluA1 subunit of cortical AMPAR, which are known to affect the conductance of AMPAR channel and synaptic plasticity. Alterations in excitatory (glutamate-mediated) neurotransmission were further documented by electrophysiological recording in the primary auditory cortex, showing GSM-induced reduction in spontaneous and sound-evoked firing rate (Occelli et al. 2018). Our current study strongly suggests that the reduced phosphorylation of gluA1 subunit implicates GSM-induced upregulation of protein phosphatase 3 (also called calcineurin). This Ca2+-calmodulin\u2013dependent serine/threonine phosphatase catalyzes dephosphorylation of gluA1 Ser 845 (Hell 2016; Sanderson et al. 2012; Sanderson et al. 2018) whereas our RNA-seq analysis shows that the GSM exposure triggered increased expression of genes encoding catalytic and regulatory subunits (Ppp3cb, Ppp3r1) of this enzyme and its calmodulin activator (Calm2 in Table 2).",

Despite rapid decay of this LPS-triggered microglial response, our RT-qPCR analysis shows that exposure to GSM-1800 MHz led to reduced expression of two genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines (Il1\u00df and Ccl5), providing evidence that GSM signals impact on the microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory reaction. Furthermore, our RNA-seq analysis uncovered other microglial genes, which are downregulated by exposure to GSM-EMF, including Akna and Litaf that encode transcription factors. While their role in LPS-mediated neuroinfammation remain to be specified, Litaf promotes expression of CCL5 and other cytokines in LPS-treated peripheral macrophages (Tang et al. 2006) whereas expression of proinflammatory cytokines was found to be under control of Akna in the lungs or in hypophysis cells (Liu et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2011).",

We found no increase in the expression of GFAP, a gene response that hallmarks astrocyte reactions in many pathological contexts and which have been inconstantly detected in the brain of rodents exposed to GSM signals (see \u201cIntroduction\u201d section for references). However in our study, GSM exposure resulted in reduced expression of genes encoding other astrocyte markers including Sox9 (Table 2) (Sun et al. 2017). We also found a significant downregulation of Adamts 4 that is primarily expressed in oligodendrocytes (Levy et al. 2015). Thus, our data provide evidence that a 2-h exposure of cortical tissues (mCx) at a SAR level of 3.22 W/kg trigger gene responses in neurons as well as in the three major glial cell types. While our RNA-seq analysis was limited to mCx, RT-qPCR analysis of nine selected DEG showed that four of these genes (Fam107a, Parvg, Akna, and Crlf1) remained responsive to GSM-1800 MHz in the entCx where the mean SAR level was reduced to 1.21 W/kg. Consistent with previous demonstration that cortical microglia morphologically react to SAR values in the range of 1.5 W/kg (Occelli et al. 2018), two of the four responsive DEG corresponded to microglia-expressed genes (Akna and Parvg), emphasizing the sensitivity of microglia to a GSM exposure in LPS-treated rats.",

In former studies, applying a same head-only GSM exposure to healthy developing or adult rats, we could not detect any significant cortical cell responses when assessing heat shock proteins, proinflammatory mediators, microglia or astroglial cell markers, molecular effectors involved in excitatory neurotransmission, or electrophysiological activities of neurons (Lameth et al. 2017; Occelli et al. 2018; Watilliaux et al. 2011). Our current investigation extends these observations showing no effect of GSM exposure on the expression of proinflammatory genes or RNA-seq\u2013related DEG in the mCx (3.22 W/kg) of healthy rats. These negative results indicate that LPS-triggered neuroinflammation can promote gene responses to GSM signals and supports our contention that the gene responses contribute to the GSM-induced changes on neuronal activity, neurotransmission, or microglial cell morphologies, which were observed in LPS-treated rats (Lameth et al. 2017; Occelli et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Besides acute pathological states, a wealth of evidence indicates that neuroinflammation contributes importantly to the progression of chronicle neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS (Chiot et al. 2019; Heneka et al. 2014). ALS rodents expressing the hSOD1G93A mutation display a progressive neuroinflammation marked by microglial activation profiles that differ from those triggered by LPS (Chiu et al. 2013; Hirbec et al. 2018). As a first investigation of the gene response to GSM-1800 MHz in ALS rats, we chose to avoid any bias due to manipulation of rodents with reduced body weight and altered skeletal muscles. In hSOD1G93A rats, the head exposure to GSM-EMF was carried out at a presymptomatic phase of the disease, albeit near to the weight peak timepoint that marks the onset of clinical signs. At this stage of the disease, we could detect altered expressions of genes including enhanced levels of Cd11b transcripts in the spinal cord, which were indicative of an early microglial activation. However, these gene modifications were not detected at the level of the mCx, and we found no significant effect of the GSM exposure on the cortical expression of RNA-seq\u2013related DEG or proinflammatory genes. Interestingly however, our qPCR analysis indicates a trend toward reduction in the cortical expression of Cox2 (p = 0.066) and Akna (p = 0.063), two genes shown to be expressed in microglia purified from WT or hSOD1G93A mice (Chiu et al. 2013). This trend was not observed in age-matched healthy rats exposed to GSM-EMF, suggesting that significant gene responses to GSM exposure could be observed in the mCx at more advanced stages of the neuroinflammatory process in ALS rats. Considering the altered expression of genes, including a microglial gene in the spinal cord of ALS rats (Fig. 6), our data raise the possibility that whole-body GSM exposures at presymptomatic stages may affect the transcriptome and the nascent inflammation in the spinal cord, with or without impact on the onset of the clinical disease.",

            "text": "In this study, we have addressed the extent of transcriptome modifications induced by a 2-h head-only exposure to GSM-1800 MHz in the mCx of LPS-treated rats. As an experimental constraint, the exposure was carried out under (ketamine/xylazine) anesthesia to prevent head movement relative to the loop antenna, which could strongly and unpredictably modify the levels and distribution of cortical SAR values (Fig. 1). Ketamine was shown to affect neuronal activity and expression of genes, during the sedation period (Jacobson et al. 2019). Whether anesthesia alters brain cell responsiveness to GSM-1800 MHz could not be ruled out. However, anesthesia avoided acute stress that would have been generated by the 2-h restrained conditions necessary to expose awake animals, which could also interfere with the effects of the EMF on the brain. Our data show moderate but significant modulation of genes triggered by the GSM signals and reveal molecular signaling that can be affected by the GSM-1800 MHz exposure. The molecular responses were detected in the motor cortex where the local SAR level reached 3.22 W/kg. This value is clearly above the upper limit set for exposure of the general public, which is 2 W/kg in tissues as close as possible to the emitting device (ICNIRP 1998). Our study shows that the gene response is attenuated in a cortical region (entCx) where the local SAR value dropped to 1.21 W/kg. Further investigation will be needed to evaluate gene responses under power conditions that match the common uses of mobile phones. Considering the time lag between the EMF exposure and the gene assessment, our results reveal gene responses that are delayed or that last up to at least 24 h after the GSM exposure, but their sustainability remains unknown. We found that the LPS-triggered acute inflammation promotes significant gene responses to GSM signals, which were not detected in healthy rats or in ALS rats exposed to GSM signals at a presymptomatic stage of the disease. However, our results provide some evidence that gene responses could be promoted at a more advanced stage of ALS. The potentiation of GSM-induced gene responses, according to the stages or the types of neuroinflammatory reaction, remains to be further explored. Understanding of how pathological conditions affect CNS cell response to GSM-EMF should help to better appraise noxious, or potentially beneficial, effects due to the EMF environment.",
