The status of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a significant determinant of protein homeostasis in muscle cells.

More importantly, the signaling pathway activated by the ER stress has emerged as a critical regulator of lipid biosynthesis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and apoptosis [1, 2].",

Ang-(1\u20137) elicits the opposite effect of Ang II [9]. Recently, we reported that ACE2 regulates mitochondrial function in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and ACE2 inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathway to preserve hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis [10, 11]. Moreover, the beneficial protection against ER stress in heart and lung by ACE2 is reported [12, 13].

PGC-1\u03b1 has been implicated in the regulation of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. As a transcriptional co-activator, PGC-1\u03b1 activates several transcription factors to drive transcription of vast gene networks involved in many aspects of energy homeostasis, including glucose utilization and fatty acid oxidation, as well as mitochondrial biogenesis and function [15]. Some key transcriptional regulators, such as LXR\u03b1 and SREBP-1c, coordinately control the lipogenesis, which increase the expression of key lipogenic genes, including those for FAS, SCD1 and ACC [16]. ACC1 converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and inhibits fatty acid entry into the mitochondria reducing \u03b2 -oxidation. In this study, we illustrated that skeletal muscle TG contents were significantly higher in the ACE2\u2212/y mice than that in the WT mice. Subsequently, we also found the mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation genes PGC-1\u03b1, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, CPT-1\u03b1 and MCAD decreased in the ACE2 KO mice, and increased in the ACE2-overexpressing C2C12 cells and the db/db mice.

Indeed, mitochondria and ER interact at contact points, called mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes, in order to exchange calcium (Ca2+) and lipids, thus regulating cell metabolism and fate [15]. In consequence of ER stress, an adaptive process named UPR is triggered. Three distinct branches of the UPR system can be initiated by transmembrane effector signal transduction proteins-protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1\u03b1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The UPR consists of three signaling branches which are initiated by signals such as the dissociation of BiP (GRP78) from the intracellular receptor domains of the ER. These signals activate combinations of the three stress sensors, protein kinase RNA-like PERK, ATF6 and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 \u03b1 (IRE 1\u03b1). CHOP is a downstream effector of all the three branches of the UPR [18]. Enhanced CHOP expression has several effects on cells including alteration of the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins that act on mitochondria [18]. In RAS, Ang II and ACE2 have been reported to induce ER stress via GRP78/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP axis in the liver [10, 19]. In the present study, the changes in GRP78/eIF2\u03b1/XBP-1/ATF4/CHOP expression suggested that ACE2 ameliorates ER stress in skeletal muscle and liver may through the same pathway. The mechanism underlying this process could involve the ability of ACE2 to regulate GRP78/ eIF2\u03b1/ XBP-1/ATF4/CHOP pathway.",

            "text": "Activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription NF-\u03baB has been connected to the impairment of insulin signaling induced by the ER stress in skeletal muscle [23]. The UPR is mainly mediated by the activation of IRE-1\u03b1, PERK/ eIF2-\u03b1, and ATF6 signaling pathways. These three cellular pathways can interact with several inflammatory signals, including NF-\u03baB [24]. It has been reported that UPR reduces the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 through several mechanisms [25, 26], which results in NF-\u03baB activation and the regulation of genes involved in inflammation and insulin resistance [24]. Given that accumulation of intracellular lipid species can activate cellular signaling cascades conducive to NF\u03baB activation [27], we check the IKK\u03b2/NF\u03baB signal pathway. Of interest, ACE2 down-regulation resulted in the increased expression of the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b2 and NF\u03baB in the skeletal muscle of the ACE2 KO mice. The insulin-signaling pathway requires insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2). IRS-1 has a major role in skeletal muscle [28]. Serine hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 is a marker of IR in peripheral tissues, which leads to subsequent activation of PI3K pathway [29]. Akt is a key protein involved in PI3K pathway, its phosphorylation promotes the metabolic activities in skeletal muscle [30]. It\u2019s remarkable that ACE2 down-regulation increased expression of the phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the skeletal muscle of the ACE2 KO mice. However, one previous study showed that phosphorylated Akt in the soleus muscle equally in the standard diet-fed ACE2KO mice compared with the WT mice [31]. These findings suggest that ACE2 mediate ER stress and mitochondria function in intracellular lipid metabolism, which was involved in the regulation of the IKK\u03b2/NF\u03baB/IRS-1 pathway, but not Akt pathway.",
