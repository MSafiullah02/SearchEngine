We investigated relationships between VRs and IA in California elementary schools over two school years in 162 3rd-5th-grade classrooms in 28 schools in three school districts: South Coast (SC), Bay Area (BA), and Central Valley (CV). We estimated relationships between daily IA and VR (estimated from two year daily real-time carbon dioxide in each classroom) in zero-inflated negative binomial models. We also compared IA benefits and energy costs of increased VRs. All school districts had median VRs below the 7.1 l/s-person California standard. For each additional 1 l/s-person of VR, IA was reduced significantly (p<0.05) in models for combined districts (\u00c01.6%) and for SC (\u00c01.2%), and nonsignificantly for districts providing less data: BA (\u00c01.5%) and CV (\u00c01.0%). Assuming associations were causal and generalizable, increasing classroom VRs from the California average (4 l/s-person) to the State standard would decrease IA by 3.4%, increase attendance-linked funding to schools by $33 million annually, and increase costs by only $4 million. Further increasing VRs would provide additional benefits. These findings, while requiring confirmation, suggest that increasing classroom VRs above the State standard would substantially decrease illness absence and produce economic benefits.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "These findings suggest a potentially large opportunity to improve the attendance and health of elementary school students in California through provision of increased classroom ventilation. The majority of classrooms in this study provided less ventilation than specified in current State guidelines. If the relationships observed here (and in several prior studies) and the costs and benefits estimated here are confirmed, it would be advantageous to students, their families, and school districts, and highly cost-effective, to ensure that ventilation rates in elementary school classrooms not only meet but substantially exceed current ventilation guidelines. Because specific exposures and response mechanisms involved have not been determined, it is possible that more energy-efficient alternatives to increased ventilation, such as filtration and reduced indoor emissions, might provide similar benefits. Ventilationthe supply of outdoor air into a buildingdecreases indoor concentrations of pollutants generated indoors. Accumulating evidence, mostly from office buildings, suggests that lower ventilation rates (VRs) in buildings are associated with increases in a variety of adverse health effects, such as infectious disease, acute symptoms, and impaired cognition or performance (Li et al., 2007; Seppanen et al., 1999; Sundell et al., 2011) . However, this evidence is still limited, especially for schools. School-age children spend more time in school than in any other indoor environment except the home (Klepeis et al., 1996) . It is clear that a substantial proportion of current classrooms do not provide even the minimum rates of ventilation specified in standards (Daisey et al., 2003) . It is important to determine whether classroom VRs influence students' health, as input for future classroom ventilation standards: could minimum allowed VRs be lowered safely to save energy, or should they be kept the same or even raised to protect student health? Illness absence from schools, which may be related to respiratory infections, asthma, allergies, gastrointestinal infections, or other disease, can serve as an indicator of health effects sufficiently severe to require staying home from school. Limited evidence suggests that lower VRs in offices, schools, and dormitory rooms are associated with increased illness absence (Seppanen et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2011) . Only one available study provides information on classroom VRs and the health of students as indicated by school absences. Shendell et al. (2004) reported that higher classroom ventilation rates were associated with a substantial reduction in student absence.

The nondispersive infrared CO 2 sensors had a resolution of 10 ppm, with accuracy (based on calibration by the manufacturer) of the larger of 5% or 100 ppm within the range 0-2000 ppm, and typically 5% within the range 2000-5000 ppm.

We excluded from VR calculations all so-called 'minimum' days in each school (short instruction days of \u00bd to 2/3 the length of normal school days), as peak indoor CO 2 on these days was less likely to reach true equilibrium levels. We estimated VR per person (V o ) in l/s-person in each classroom for each school day during the study, in a mass balance model that used the indoor equilibrium CO 2 concentration minus the outdoor value (Equation 1).

Current ventilation standards per State of California. Table S2 . Current ASHRAE ventilation rate requirements (ASHRAE, 2010, p. 12). Table S3 . Unadjusted IRR estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from zero-inflated negative binomial models for association between classroom ventilation rate (VR) metrics and daily classroom proportion of illness absence, per increase of 1 l/s-person VR in observed range of 1-20 l/s-person. Table S4 . Alternate adjusted IRR estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from zero-inflated negative binomial models for association between single-day classroom ventilation rate (VR) and period-averaged daily classroom proportion of illness absence, per increase of 1 l/s-person VR in observed range of 1-20 l/s-person (notenone of models producing these estimates converged, so estimates may not be meaningful). Table S5 . Predicted proportion of illness absence at specified outdoor air ventilation rates, based on adjusted models using 7-day averaged ventilation rates, in three California climate zones. Table S6 . Estimated losses in revenue to school districts. Table S7 . Estimates of the energy use and costs for cooling and heating the ventilation air provided to classrooms in California.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 585, "end": 607, "text": "Shendell et al.
