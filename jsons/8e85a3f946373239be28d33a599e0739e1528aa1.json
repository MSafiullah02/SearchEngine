Exclusion criteria were a 19 language barrier or severe comorbidity, i.e. congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, prematurity <32 20 weeks, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell disease, immunodeficiency, cardiovascular disease, neuromuscular disease, 21 oncological disease or a severe congenital disorder. Transnasal nasopharyngeal swabs and endotracheal aspirates 22 were obtained within four hours after intubation by trained nurses. All samples were stored immediately in a -20\u00b0C 23 freezer followed by transportation on dry ice to a -80\u00b0C freezer until further processing. 24 Data on medical history as well as data on demographic, lifestyle and environmental characteristics were obtained 25 by questionnaires and pharmacy printouts. Clinical data of the cases were obtained from medical charts. 26 Study design case-control cohort 27 Next to the PICU cohort, we conducted a prospective, matched case-control study from September 2013 to September 28 2016. Patients were enrolled under the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the PICU cohort and were age-, 29 gender-, and time-matched with healthy controls in a 1:2 ratio. Cases were recruited from three Dutch teaching 30 hospitals. Healthy children were recruited through well-baby clinics and the local municipalities. In addition to the 31 exclusion criteria of the cases, healthy controls were also excluded if the child had fever (\u226538\u2103) or a respiratory tract 32 infection (except rhinitis) in the previous four weeks, or antibiotic treatment in the previous three months. Transnasal 33 nasopharyngeal swabs were taken of cases generally within 1 hour after admission, and of controls during a home 34 visit within 2 weeks after admission of the matching case by trained nurses and physicians. All samples were directly 35 stored in a -20\u00b0C freezer followed by transport on dry ice to a -80\u00b0C freezer until further processing. Samples of 36 cases were always stored in the same box as that of their matching controls. Metadata of this cohort was obtained 37 similar to that of the PICU cohort. Both cohorts were registered as one study (www.trialregister.nl, NTR5132) and 38 were approved by the Dutch National Ethics Committee (NL42019\u00b7094\u00b712).

Little was known about the composition, variability and diversity of the 43 nasopharyngeal microbiota, except for one study performed by our group recruiting 96 children of 18 months of 44 age. 46 We used the data from this study for the sample size calculation of the current studies.

We selected two bacterial taxa with high abundance: one with high variability 48 (Streptococcus, mean relative abundance 13\u00b71%, standard deviation [SD] 1\u00b76 times the mean) and one with low 49 variability (Moraxella, mean abundance 38\u00b75%, SD 0\u00b78 times the mean). In addition, we selected two bacterial taxa 50 with low abundance and high variability (Prevotella Shahii, mean abundance 0\u00b73%, SD 6\u00b74 times the mean) and low 51 variability (Helcococcus, mean abundance 0,4%, SD 0\u00b79 times the mean). Based on these data and on a p-value of 52 0\u00b7002 (a p-value of 0\u00b705, corrected by Bonferroni for multiple testing because of evaluation of at least top 25 species), 53 we calculated that 150 cases and 300 controls were needed to achieve a sufficient power (80% or more) to detect 54 more than threefold shifts in abundance of bacterial taxa with high abundance and low and high variability. 55 Furthermore, these numbers of cases and controls would obtain a power of 80% to detect more than two-fold shifts 56 in bacterial taxa with low abundance and low variability, and for low abundant bacteria with high variability we 57 would be sufficiently powered to detect eight-fold shifts. A case-control ratio of 1:3 did not significantly improve 58 the power and, therefore, we decided for a 1:2 case-control design to be optimal in our setting. 60 Regarding matching variables, we decided to match in particular for time because of the findings of the above-61 mentioned study that respiratory microbiota profiles varied strongly with season. 46 Our choice for age and sex was 62 based on several keystone papers reporting that the developing gut microbiota varies across age and sex. 47-49 63 Expert review panel 64 Two expert pediatricians independently classified all cases of the case-control cohort in three major disease 65 phenotypes, i.e. pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and wheezing illness. Cases with a mixed or unclear phenotype were 66 deemed mixed. All disagreements were resolved by consensus. The classification of the expert panelists was based 67 on the entire medical record of the child, including all clinical notes at and during admission, laboratory assessments 68 and imaging. Figure 1 ). 50 Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae was done by 74 quantitative qPCR targeting the autolysin (lytA) gene. 51 The lytA C T -values had a strong correlation with the OTU 75 annotated as Streptococcus pneumoniae (3) confirming its origin (Pearson's r=0\u00b782, p<0\u00b7001). In addition, we 76 performed a multiplex qPCR (Fast Track Diagnostics) to confirm or further nuance the OTUs annotated as 77 Staphylococcus, Moraxella or Haemophilus. We found that the OTU annotated as S. aureus/epidermidis (7) was 78 significantly related with the S. aureus C T -values (Pearson's r=-0\u00b734, p<0\u00b7001) and that the OTU annotated as M. 79 catarrhalis/nonliquefaciens (1) was significantly related with the M. catarrhalis C T -values (Pearson's r=-0\u00b751, 80 p<0\u00b7001). We therefore did not change their original annotation. The OTU annotated as H. haemolyticus (2) was 81 significantly related with the H. influenzae C T -values (Pearson's r=-0\u00b771, p<0\u00b7001); therefore, we changed its 82 annotation into H. influenzae/haemolyticus (2). 83 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing 84 Bacterial DNA was isolated from samples and quantified as previously described. 33,52 In short, an aliquot of 200\u00b5l 85 of each sample was added to 650\u00b5l lysis buffer with 0\u00b71 mm zirconium beads and 550\u00b5l phenol. All samples were 86 mechanically lysed with a bead beater procedure. Almost all samples fulfilled our quality control standards for 87 reliable analyses, having DNA levels of \u22650\u00b73 pg/\u00b5l over negative controls (>98%, Supplementary Figure 1) . 88 Amplification of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using barcoded universal primer 89 pair 533F/806R. Amplicons were quantified by PicoGreen (Thermofisher) and pooled in equimolar amounts. 90 Amplicon pools of samples and controls were sequenced in five Illumina MiSeq runs (San Diego, CA, USA). 91 Samples from cases were always processed simultaneously with that of their matching controls to uphold identical 92 storage and processing conditions within each of the case-control sets. 94 Raw sequences were trimmed using an adaptive, window-based trimming algorithm (Sickle, Q>20, length threshold 95 of 150 nucleotides). 53 We aimed to further reduce the number of sequence errors in the reads by applying an error 96 correction algorithm (BayesHammer, SPAdes genome assembler toolkit). 54 Forward and reverse reads were then 97 assembled into contigs using PANDAseq. 55 Merged reads were demultiplexed using QIIME v1\u00b79. 56 After removal 98 of singleton sequences, we removed chimeras using both de novo and reference (against Gold database) chimera 99 identification (UCHIME algorithm in VSEARCH). 57,58 VSEARCH abundance-based greedy clustering was used to 100 pick OTUs at a 97% identity threshold. 59 Taxonomic annotation was executed using the RDP-II na\u00efve Bayesian 101 classifier on SILVA v119 training set. 60 Taxonomic assignment was validated by blasting against the NCBI database, 102 using a 100% identity cut-off. After aligning the node representative sequences to the Silva v119 core alignment 103 database using the PyNAST method, 61 a rooted phylogenetic tree was calculated using FastTree. 62 Two samples were below our threshold of 15,000 reads/sample and were therefore excluded from further analysis ( Supplementary  Figure 1) . Removing these left 33,020,647 reads in total (mean 63,945 \u00b1 26,270 reads/sample). The Good's estimator 106 of all samples was above 99\u00b79% and rarefaction curves on raw count data approached plateau (Supplementary 107 Figure 12 ), indicating that the coverage degree of our sequencing was very high. 63 We generated an abundance-108 filtered dataset by including only those OTUs that were present at or above a confidence level of detection (0\u00b71% 109 relative abundance) in at least 2 samples, retaining 306 OTUs in total. 64 To avoid OTUs with identical annotations, 110 we refer to OTUs using their taxonomical annotations combined with a rank number based on the abundance of each 111 given OTU. The raw OTU-counts table was used for calculations of local diversity (\u03b1-diversity) and analyses using 112 the metagenomeSeq package. 65 The OTU-proportions table was used for all other downstream analyses, including 113 hierarchical clustering and random forest modelling. Moreover, the Bray-Curtis (dis)similarity metric was 114 consistently used to express ecological distance (\u03b2-diversity) in all analyses because it includes proportional 115 abundance information and excludes joint-absence information, and thereby yields useful insights into the specific 116 structure of our data. 66 117 Quality control of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing 118 In total, we had 34 negative controls during DNA isolation. The DNA load of these DNA isolation blanks were two 119 orders of magnitude lower compared to the samples analyzed in this study (median 0\u00b726 vs 49\u00b77 pg/\u00b5l; 120 (Supplementary Figure 13A ). In addition, 14 DNA isolation and PCR blanks were sequenced along with the study 121 samples. All blanks yielded <15,000 reads and the number of reads was at least one orders of magnitude lower 122 compared to that of the samples (median 4,618 vs 67,276 reads; Supplementary Figure 13B ). There were no taxa 123 shared across all blanks. Total microbiota community of blanks were highly diverse from samples (adonis R 2 =9\u00b71%, 124 p<0\u00b7001) and hierarchical clustering clearly separated the blanks (Supplementary Figure 13C) . These results 125 robustly indicate that our strict sequencing protocol resulted in no apparent contamination. However, to ensure our 126 data was of the highest quality, we used the bacterial biomass to identify and remove contaminants. We identified 13 Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted q less than 0\u00b705 was considered statistically significant. 137 To compare baseline characteristics and viral detection between cases and controls, we used conditional logistic 138 regression analysis. 139 To assess the concordance between the bacterial microbiota of the nasopharynx with that of endotracheal aspirates, 140 we compared the intra-individual and inter-individual Bray-Curtis similarity. The Bray-Curtis similarity was 141 calculated using the formula: 1 -Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Statistical significance was determined using Wilcoxon 142 rank-sum test. 143 Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity were used to visualize 144 differences of total microbiota communities and statistical significance was calculated by adonis (vegan, 1,999 145 permutations). Because there was substantial multicollinearity (vif.cca-function; two covariates were aliased; range 146 variance inflation factor of other covariates, 1\u00b71 -8\u00b78) between some of the covariates, we performed a stepwise selected multivariable distance-based redundancy analysis (ordiR2step, 1,999 permutations). 69,70 Directionality of 148 these covariates were projected in NMDS plots using envfit (vegan). 149 Unsupervised average linkage hierarchical clustering was performed as described previously (hclust and vegdist, 150 vegan package). 13 The optimal number of clusters contained in the microbiota dataset was determined based on 151 Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz indices (cluster.stats, fpc package). Clusters including less than five individuals 152 were excluded for further downstream analysis. Random forest classifier analyses was performed to determine 153 biomarker species and factors that most discriminate between clusters by the interpretation step of the two-stage 154 feature selection procedure of VSURF (10,000 trees each iteration, with 100 thresholding iterations and 50 155 interpretation iterations). 71 A chi-square test was used to test for the association between clusters and 156 presence/absence of acute disease. 157 We used metagenomeSeq to identify specific microbial taxa associated with cases or controls (filtered on taxa present 158 in >5% of the samples, 100 maximum iterations, mixed model design). 65 In addition, using a 10-fold cross-validated 159 VSURF procedure we performed random forest classifier analysis to determine which microbial taxa best distinguish 160 disease from health. Taxa that were selected at least 1 time during the interpretation step, were deemed minor 161 classifier taxa, while taxa that were selected 9 or 10 times were defined as major classifier taxa.

Variable importance was estimated by 166 calculating the mean importance after randomly permuting the values of each selected variable (100 replicates, caret 167 package). 73 The direction of the variable associations was crudely estimated post-hoc using the point biserial 168 correlation coefficients, where the relative abundances of bacterial taxa were transformed with the arcsine square-169 root transformation for proportional data. Performance of the sparse random forest models was evaluated by 170 calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) using the out-of-bag predictions for classification (pROC package) 74 171 as previously described. 75 Using the above procedures, we also build a sparse random forest prediction model to 172 investigate to what extend hospitalization duration could be predicted with all available data.
