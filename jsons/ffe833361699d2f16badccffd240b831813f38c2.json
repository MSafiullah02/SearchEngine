Given the perspectives gained and lessons learnt from these past events, we should be better prepared to face the current COVID-19 outbreak.",

The disease has an estimated mean incubation period of 5.2 days (95% CI 4.1-7.0) and a basic reproductive number (Ro) of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.9). 5 It is possible that people with COVID-19 may be infectious even before showing significant symptoms. 6 However, it is believed that those who have symptoms are the ones who are primarily causing the spread of the infection. These figures have been updated recently, with an estimated Ro of between 2.0 and 2.5 for SARS-CoV-2, incubation period of 1-14 days (mean 5-6) days and a mortality rate of about 3.8%, based on a larger sample of 55 924 cases. 7 This event evoked a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as it has many parallels to the outbreak of SARS during 2002 and 2003. Similar to COVID-19, SARS originated during winter in China, spread rapidly all over the world affecting 37 countries, and was caused by a zoonotic novel coronavirus. However, in comparison, SARS affected far fewer people (8098 reported cases) but had a higher case-fatality rate of 9.6% (774 deaths). Another zoonotic novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, originated in the Middle East in 2012. In all, there have been 2494 reported MERS-CoV cases resulting in 858 deaths (case-fatality rate, 34%) in 27 countries. Outbreaks of MERS have been reported in hospitals in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and South Korea. 8 Our experiences in coping with the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks have better prepared us to face the new challenge posed by COVID-19. In particular, we learnt many valuable lessons from dealing with the SARS outbreak, which was an unprecedented event. The perspectives and experiences gained from managing SARS, 9 and comparisons to our responses to the COVID-19 outbreak include the following:",

The number of HCWs as a proportion of all cases of COVID-19 appears to be smaller and HCWs comprise less than 20% of cases. Several factors may have contributed to this. For example, in Singapore, there are established occupational medicine departments to protect HCWs in major Singapore government hospitals in 2020. In comparison, no such departments existed in 2003. To reduce the risk of occupational exposure to infection, personal protective equipment (PPE) have been stockpiled, HCWs are mask fitted, repeated training in infection control techniques have been given, and strict adherence to infection control protocols is mandated. There is also extensive daily monitoring of health among staff. 13 World Health Organization has developed several technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19 for HCWs, including rights, roles and responsibilities of HCWs 14 which comprises key considerations for safety and health. As part of a WHO preparedness and response initiative, they have also established a risk assessment tool that is to be used by health care facilities to determine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection of all HCWs who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient. This tool also provides recommendations for appropriate management of these HCWs, according to their infection risk. 15 However, the magnitude of the pandemic, with its explosive increase in number of infected patients requiring treatment in health care facilities, has resulted in health care establishments being overwhelmed in many countries. There are shortages of PPE such as N95 masks and surgical masks for health care workers, and ventilators for patients even in the more developed countries with robust health care systems. 16 There has also been a profound loss of trust in authority with perceptions that policy is guided more by scarcity | 3 of 6 OPINION than science. 17 In the developing countries, the situation is even more dire.",

For the general public, information on types of masks to wear (surgical masks would suffice, rather than N95 masks), the proper way of wearing and disposing of masks in a safe and socially responsible manner has been given. 26 However, it is important to note that such information continues to evolve. The latest guidelines from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in April 2020 27 recommend that masks or face coverings should be worn by the public when they go out.

The \"curve\" refers to the projected number of people who will contract COVID-19 over a period of time. By implementing community isolation measures, the daily number of disease cases can be kept at a manageable level for medical providers, hence it may help lessen the healthcare burden. 28 As the situation evolves, some countries are employing more restrictive measures such as travel bans and lockdowns. It was reported that by the end of March 2020, more than 100 countries had instituted either a full or partial lockdown, impacting billions of residents. 29 ",

Among the occupational groups at risk were HCWs, animal and food preparation handlers, transport workers (ranging from flight attendants to taxi drivers), and laboratory researchers working with the SARS-CoV. For example, more than a third of the early cases of SARS (pre-February 2003) occurred in persons who handled, killed, or sold food animals, or in those who prepared or served food. Thus, in addition to public health measures, an appropriate occupational health response is also necessary. 10 In the current COVID-19 outbreak, diverse occupational groups are recognized to be at risk. For example, in Singapore, 68% of the first 25 locally transmitted cases were probably related to occupational exposure. 30 The workers who are in the hospitality, retail, food and beverage industry who served infected tourists, transport workers, multinational company workers who attended an international meeting, a domestic worker and even a security officer who served quarantine orders were all at risk. These occupations were not covered by the occupational health legislation of Singapore in 2003, which was the Factories Act. However, in 2020, the Workplace Safety and Health Act in Singapore applies to many of these workers. Thus, if and when the disease is officially recognized as an occupational disease, these workers (and not only factory workers) will be covered by the health and safety law.",
