Special attention should be paid to providing adequate calcium if cereal hays are fed; supplemental selenium, cobalt, copper, iodine, and molybdenum if regional soils and forages are known to be deficient; and vitamin E and vitamin A if stored feeds are fed.\u2022If sheep are bunk fed, feeder space should allow all ewes to eat at once (i.e., a minimum of 40 cm [16 inches] of feeder space per pregnant ewe) (Table 91-1\n).\u2022If sheep are housed in a barn or dry lot, additional space must be allowed for pregnancy (a minimum of 1.4 m2 [16 square feet] per ewe) (see Table 91-1).\u2022Treatment with an anthelmintic is given to prevent preparturient rise in fecal egg count. This recommendation may be modified according to regional conditions.\u2022If sheep are shorn or if warranted, treatment for external parasites (lice, keds, and mange) is given.\u2022For ewes lambing at pasture, supplementation with a coccidiostat in the mineral premix may be helpful to reduce contamination of lambing grounds.\n",

No preference in time of day to deliver has been observed, but if disturbed, the ewe may stop labor for a few minutes until settled again. Normal presentation of the lamb is described as anterior dorsosacral with front limbs extended and preceding the nose by approximately 6 cm (2 to 4 inches). Also normal but associated with greater risk to the safe delivery of the lamb is posterior dorsosacral with hind limbs extended. If delivery is delayed and the umbilical cord is compressed between the lamb and the pelvis of the ewe, the lamb may suffocate before delivery is complete. After delivery of the lamb, the ewe stands, causing the umbilicus to rupture. The ewe turns and begins to nuzzle and lick the lamb to stimulate breathing and to clean it off.",

Mouth-to-nose resuscitation should not be done because of the risk of contracting a zoonotic infection from the lamb, such as Chlamydophila abortus or Coxiella burnetii infection. A technique of inflating the lungs that has been used with some success is as follows: A lamb stomach tube is inserted into the esophagus of the lamb. By means of gentle pressure applied with a thumb and forefinger, the esophagus is closed off distal to the end of the tube. The other hand is used to close off the mouth and nostrils. The clinician softly blows once into the tube. With the esophagus closed off, the air will be forced down the trachea into the lungs.

Immersion in warm water is the most rapid but requires that the client hold the lamb while in water and then dry it immediately, to avoid chilling from evaporation. Placement in a warming box in which the lamb lies on a grate that allows warm air to circulate around it generally works the best (Fig. 91-6\n). A household hair dryer works well for this purpose. Air temperature should not exceed 41\u00b0 C. A warming pad will accomplish the same thing if the lamb also is covered with a blanket and turned frequently. Least efficient is use of a heat lamp, which offers only radiant heat to the exposed part of the lamb.",

If no suckle reflex is present, the lamb should have 20% dextrose administered into the intraperitoneal cavity. This procedure begins with drawing up 20 ml of 50% dextrose into a 60-ml syringe and adding to it 30 ml of hot, boiled, clean water. The resultant solution should be at body temperature. Instillation into the peritoneal cavity is accomplished by hanging the lamb vertically and injecting just off midline distal to the umbilicus, using a sterile 20-gauge needle and administering 10 ml/kg of body weight. After administration, the lamb can be warmed.",

Correction should be done immediately and may involve one of the following procedures: Mild cases may be resolved by manually everting the lid several times a day for a few days. Moderately severe cases may be resolved by an injection of penicillin into the palpebral conjunctiva. The resulting bleb should be sufficient to roll the eyelid out. Occasionally the procedure needs to be repeated in 5 to 7 days. Other, surgical-type methods include pinching a small amount of tissue into two wound clips placed parallel to the lower lid, crushing a fold of skin with hemostats parallel to the lower lid, and cutting a length of skin from below the lower lid and suturing it. With all of these latter methods, care must be taken to apprehend sufficient skin to allow proper eversion of the eyelid. Some evidence indicates that this is a heritable condition, so lambs with entropion should not be selected as replacements, particularly rams.",

Management practices that will reduce environmental exposure to coccidial oocysts include use of properly designed feeders that do not allow for fecal contamination of the feed; provision of a clean bedding pack or slatted floors for nursing and growing lambs; and a raised water source. Thorough disinfection before lambing may reduce the level of coccidia in the environment, but adult ewes and then lambs quickly recontaminate the pens. It often is necessary to also use a drug that controls coccidia. Table 91-2\nlists the commonly used preventive treatments for coccidiosis. Feed additives should be added to free-choice pelleted or texturized lamb rations to ensure adequate intakes. A prescription often is required for addition of these coccidiostats because of the variability among countries in licensing these drugs for use in sheep. Commercial cattle feeds or supplements with coccidiostats included should not be used because of the high risk of copper toxicity.",

If the flock is experiencing high morbidity from neonatal diarrhea during the lambing period, ewes that are still pregnant should be moved to a clean area for lambing. People managing the sick lambs should not handle newborn lambs without changing and washing their clothes in disinfectant soap. Vaccination of pregnant ewes with a bovine E. coli scour vaccine has been done, but a preferred approach is first to attempt to break the cycle by focusing on cleaning and disinfection of the lambing and lamb-rearing environments.",

Environmental conditions, however, appear to be more important in determining the incidence of pneumonia in young lambs. Stocking density, humidity, diurnal or nocturnal temperature fluctuations, extreme heat and cold, frequency of air changes, ammonia levels, and dust all increase the stress on the respiratory system. In outbreaks of pneumonia, metaphylaxis has been used with success.
