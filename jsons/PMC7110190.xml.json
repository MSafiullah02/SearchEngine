The enzyme precipitated at high temperature and the thermal denaturation was irreversible. The melting profiles are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2S. While two distinct transitions were observed around 49.2 and 59.2\u00b0C in the melting profile of the Mixture 1; 49.5 and 62.8\u00b0C in the Mixture 2, 46.5 and 58.6\u00b0C in the Mixture 3, only one large transition was observed around 53.9\u00b0C in the profile of WT. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the transition proceeds in a three-state fashion with indication of independent behaviour by either of the domains in the mixtures. Among the truncated SARS-CoV Mpro, the C terminally truncated protein had a significantly lower Tm (50.2 for  and 52.2 for ) than did the N terminally truncated one (57.7\u00b0C and 79.2\u00b0C for  and 61.2\u00b0C for ). The observation is an indication that the catalytic domain is intrinsically less stable and that it derives a significant fraction of its stabilization energy from its interactions with domain III through the linker. The Tm value for WT was 53.9\u00b0C (\u223c54), which is a little higher than that of  (50.2\u00b0C) and  (52.2\u00b0C). These results are consistent with the previous report that the C-terminal domain is involved in stabilizing the N-terminal catalytic domain of SARS-CoV Mpro (10). Two transitions with the midpoint temperatures at 57.7 and 79.2\u00b0C upon thermal unfolding were also demonstrated in . Moreover, one transition temperature for  was determined to be 68.2\u00b0C, which is higher than that of WT (53.9\u00b0C). Further characterization of these transitions is needed to address what structure is attributed to the unfolding, when narrowed down to the area of a single \u03b1-helix in  and .",

The function of the protein may be retained in the reconstituted complex depending on the number of cuts and where in the sequence they are made. Fragment complementing systems have been used to probe the molecular features required for fragments to associate and fold into a stable native-like protein complex (24) and to elucidate autonomous folding units. We applied this concept in a broad way to a protein that contains multiple domains. Our previous studies indicated that the C-terminal domain-truncated Mpro could fold independently into an intact chymotrypsin-like fold, but it showed no enzyme activity (10). Our other experimental data showed that the extra C-terminal domain played a pivotal role in controlling dimerization and enzyme activity (25). The present results on Mpro fragments further defined our earlier studies that domain III acts to stabilize the catalytic N-terminal domain (I+II). Furthermore, the different SARS-CoV Mpro-complementing fragment systems described herein were used to probe the structural role of the loop. We confirmed that the covalent linkage between domains (I+II) and (III) is essential, which suggests that the long loop might stabilize the C-terminal domain. It is likely that some critical structural stabilizing interactions are conserved in the loop-retaining fragments with respect to those present in the natural and longer SARS-CoV fragment. Because of this,  displays a higher content of \u03b2-sheets, which is its major secondary structure, than does , and  instead displays more helicity than . Examining crystal structures of Mpro reveals that residues around 187 have interactions with residues around 40 and 54 of N-terminal domain, and residues around 198 have interactions with residues around 240 of C-terminal domain. Thus, the truncations we did very likely affected the folding and stability of the domains. This may well explain the differences, we observed by CD and the difference in stability for domains with and without the linker loop.",

The mixtures of various combinations of these fragments (nicked SARS CoV Mpro) revealed structural features similar to those of the intact protein. However, some differences between the nicked and intact species were found from the AUC studies. These negative results seem to base on the mixing of the individual domains which are non-interacting. Little convinced result to show that the component in these mixtures could interact and form the structure like WT Mpro. The nicked proteins attained significant secondary and tertiary structures, as did the native enzyme. However, they seemed to lack specific domain\u2013domain complementation (or interactions), thereby precluding a final folding step to assume the catalytic competent conformation, as in the native Mpro. Therefore, it appears that the individual N- and C-terminal domains can fold independently, but cannot associate to form the enzymatic active dimer. This is consistent with current experimental observations that only the dimeric form of SARS-CoV Mpro possesses biological function and that the dissociated monomer is enzymatically inactive (26\u201328). Shi et al. (3) have reported that the isolated extra domain III existed as a dimer even at a very low protein concentration and showed no concentration dependence by dynamic light scattering and size-exclusion FPLC analyses. A more recent paper reports that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV Mpro can form a 3D domain swapped dimer in the crystalline form (29). However, under our AUC experimental conditions, the  and seem to exist majorly as a monomeric form in solution (Fig. 6A).",

In the present case, the cleaved peptide bonds are close to the adjacent essential structural domains.

We demonstrated here that the mixtures of Mpro also showed a reversible biphasic unfolding curve, similar to the intact WT form. Nevertheless, there was no enzyme activity found for any mixture. In addition, no dimer formation between any truncated protease was observed with or without the presence of WT Mpro as a template. These results indicate that the covalent linkage between the chymotrypsin-like domain and the extra domain must be essential for enzyme activity and for the quaternary structural integrity of the SARS-CoV Mpro.",
