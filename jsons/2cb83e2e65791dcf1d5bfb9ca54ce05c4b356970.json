Among the seven cases infected by Salmonella species, four were by the Choleraesuis serotype, the most frequently isolated from swine.

In our study, there was an association of children having a bacterial gastroenteritis resulting from contact with animals; however, most of the contacts (97%) were related to domestic animals, and when contact with animals was not considered in the model, the association was not significantly modified.

The evaluation of bacteria, viruses and parasites at the same time for most of the cases should be underlined, as well as the important characterization of the quality of the water serving the participants' residences. Finally, our rather extensive questionnaire permitted us to consider in the analysis most of the factors commonly associated with gastroenteritis. Some limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. Unexpectedly, very few cases of bacterial and parasitical infection occurred, reducing the power to detect some statistically meaningful results. This limits our ability to answer to the research question. Also, the evaluation of viral and parasitical infection for community cases was frequently lacking, but it did not have any impact on the bacterial findings that were the most preeminent infection among potential zoonotic cases. We nevertheless acknowledge that community cases were only a selection of incident cases (that consulted a physician and had faecal sample). Our measure of animal farming intensity was quite crude, which may reduce our ability to detect an association with animal farming activity.
