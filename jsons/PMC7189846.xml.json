Elective cases have been scaled back, restricting programs to urgent and emergent cases so that resources may be mobilized to care for patients with COVID-19. Wait lists have grown, and those being asked to wait for surgery may be forced to experience excessively prolonged wait times. In an effort to mitigate this, patients who were once deemed surgical candidates have increasingly been referred for medical management or alternative percutaneous therapies. Despite this, there remains a significant number of patients in whom timely surgical intervention, even if during a global pandemic, outweighs the risk of further delay.",

As new data emerges, these guiding statements may change over time given the fluidity and scope of the current pandemic. Geographic differences in epidemiology and practice patterns across Canada must be acknowledged, and we hope that these guiding statements will allow for the deliberate and graded increase in cardiac surgical care as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease.",
