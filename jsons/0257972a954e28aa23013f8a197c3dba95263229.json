This paper compares China's relatively effective response to the 2002-3 SARS outbreak with Taiwan's relatively ineffective response, focusing on three variables that constitute China's 'authoritarian advantage' -centralized decision making powers; public support; and, relations with the mass media. The paper rejects a fourth explanatory variable specific to the Taiwan casemembership in international organizations. Drawing heavily on the Taiwan example, the paper concludes by suggesting options for overcoming the authoritarian advantage in pandemic response.",

China's perceived success in controlling SARS stands in stark contrast with Taiwan's troubled response to its own SARS outbreak. Why does Taiwan, a geographically small, densely populated country with a democratic government, wealthy and modern knowledge-based economy, fail to effectively respond to SARS whereas big, heavily populated, relatively under-developed and authoritarian China succeeds? Does regime type explain China's relative success, and to the extent that regime type matters, what can be done to compensate for China's 'authoritarian advantage' in crisis response?",

Due to space limitations, I focus primarily on Taiwan, drawing on previous studies of China to highlight the differences between Chinese and on the crisis literature and previously conducted research on China's SARS response, three factors appear key to effective response in public health crises. These are centralized decision making powers, public support for government initiatives, and government ability to shape the tone of the crisis in the mass media. Utilizing its authoritarian advantage, China's regime was able to effectively centralize decision making powers, rally public support and control the message presented by the mass media with the end result an effective pandemic response. Did Taiwan's lack of an authoritarian regime undermine its engagement with these three factors, contributing to the ineffective Taiwan response?",

Thus, I ask, does an authoritarian advantage in particular play a role in effective pandemic response? In so doing I do not suggest that authoritarian advantage is the sole causal variable for successful pandemic response. I acknowledge that other variables may contribute to effective pandemic response. However since it is impossible to identify the causal impact of all potential explanatory variables, I seek to understand the impact of the authoritarian advantage in particular. 2 And yet, because the Taiwan government of the time repeatedly and explicitly asserted that Taiwan's lack of membership in international public health organizations constituted a major obstacle to effective SARS response, I consider this possibility as well.

Thus, between 1954 and 1970 the annual number of cases of recognized infectious disease outbreaks declined from 6,000 to 300. By the 1980s the preventive care approach adopted by Taiwan's public health 4 Limited local transmission meaning there was no evidence of international spread from the area since 15 March 2003 and no transmission other than close person-to-person contact. 5 Community transmission as opposed to secondary transmission to family or health care worker contacts. \"Super spreader\" is defined as a highly infectious person who spreads the agent of an infectious disease to many other people. In Taiwan there were a total of four super spreaders identified. http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey022951 <accessed 9 February 2007>. 6 MMWR 2003 . 7 WHO 2003 For an equivalent study of the Chinese public health system see Schwartz et al. [8] . 9 Taiwan's public health system consists of two levels. At the central level is the DoH (Department of Health) which reports directly to the Executive Yuan. The second, local level consists of health departments in Taiwan's two special municipalities -Taipei and Kaohsiung -as well as health bureaus based in twenty-three county and city governments. Under the authority of the Executive Yuan, the DoH develops health care policies, declares and cancels epidemic alerts, gives orders for both household and port quarantines, and supervises, commands, guides and assesses local level policy implementation. The local level is responsible for developing implementation plans for DoH policies. 10 At the heart of Taiwan's infectious disease control system is the Communicable Disease Control Act. The Act provides the legal basis for Taiwan's responses to any infectious disease outbreaks. Article three of the Act designates five categories of communicable diseases and the corresponding severity-based responses. Category 1 includes diseases such as Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever, and with post-SARS revisions, SARS. Category 2 includes diseases such as Typhus Fever, Diphtheria and Meningococcal Meningitis. Category 3 includes diseases such as Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Rubella. Category 4 includes known communicable diseases and syndromes not appearing in the first three categories, but that the government deems should be controlled. Category 5 is an ad-hoc classification for emerging infectious diseases so that government and health authorities can legally implement control measures as needed until further scientific investigation allows for permanent reclassification. 11 Taiwan shifted away from its emphasis on preventive care in the 1980s as government increasingly prioritized rapid economic growth and profitability. Because preventive care proved unprofitable, newly privatized treatment facilities shifted their focus to curative care. Even government infectious disease departments shrank with a decline in DoH budgetary allocations for all that was related to disease prevention, public health services and public health education [9] .",

In terms of infectious disease control, both China and Taiwan followed a similar path by providing effective health care focused on prevention. The result for both included plummeting mortality rates and rapidly improving quality of life indicators. Their success is illustrated by the fact that both early on underwent the epidemiological transitionwith chronic diseases replacing infectious diseases as the main cause of death. Both countries also moved in the 1980s from a health care system focused on preventive care to one focused on curative care.

A 2008 study by Huang, Wang and Chen found that Taiwan's health care system compares favourably with OECD country health care systems in terms of health and efficiency indicators [11] . By contrast, by the time of the SARS outbreak, China's once much vaunted public health system was being described as worse even than those in parts of Africa. 16 In addition, Taiwan is an island, and is therefore relatively easily isolated from the outside. By contrast, China has long, often porous land borders. Unlike China's massive 1.34 billion person population, Taiwan's population is relatively small (23 million). Taiwan is a developed country with advanced medical facilities and well trained physicians. China too has advanced medical facilities and well trained physicians, however these are heavily concentrated in major cities.

Thus, when the leadership identifies an issue as a high priority, it is able to recentralise power to itself. After initial hesitation, the Chinese leadership concluded that the SARS outbreak represented a significant threat to China. The leadership therefore recentralised power, establishing clear lines of control from the central level to the township level. While local governments occasionally disregarded central government decisions, by and large, the centre was able to control policy implementation. Thus, local health officials were required to provide daily reports up a clear chain of command to the centre. These reports were made available online. When the newly established (2001) Chinese CDC proved insufficiently effective in responding to SARS, the central government transferred responsibility for SARS to the MoH. In an unusual step for the PRC, the minister of health was replaced with a vice-premier (Wu Yi). Wu Yi's high rank and status in the Party/state lent tremendous prestige and power to the MoH, signalling the seriousness with which the centre took the outbreak.",

These regional offices took over case review responsibilities and established a far more efficient set of local SARS expert committees. However, these multiple SARS committees lacked clear bureaucratic lines of control.

These required that any person arriving at a hospital be checked for fever prior to entering the hospital grounds. If the person was found to have fever or other SARS-like symptoms, she was placed in a ward isolated from the hospital itself. 20 In Taiwan, hospitals lacked standard procedures for admitting fever patients. Panicked patients with minor illnesses swamped many hospitals. Overall, hospital facilities proved insufficient to absorb the flood of patients potentially ill with SARS. Consequently, while awaiting proper treatment and isolation, undiagnosed SARS patients often remained in crowded wards or emergency departments for days, exposing hundreds of people to SARS.",

Eighty six point five percent of Chinese express a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in political parties (CCP), whereas in Taiwan only 35.6 percent express such confidence. These significant differences reflect the greater legitimacy enjoyed by China's central government leadership and the government's greater ability to mobilize the population in response to a crisis. 23 Due to the relative lack of public confidence in the leadership in Taiwan, government leaders hesitated to act strongly against the SARS outbreak for fear of alienating the voting population. Officials feared that unpopular restrictions on personal movement and economic activity might turn the public against the ruling party. The public, influenced by often sensationalist reports in the mass media, were openly sceptical of government statements and acted to block or simply ignore central government initiatives. For example, despite ongoing central government assurances, when the public in Hsinchu county learned of plans to move SARS patients to their local hospital from hospitals in Taipei, numerous people, led by local government officials, rallied to block the transfer. Similar incidents across the island left Taiwan 'divided into many small fortresses\u2026'. Notably, though recognizing the benefits to activating civil society organizations to respond to outbreaks, this was not done during SARS. 24 Enjoying high public confidence, China's leadership could mobilize the public. While its ability to recentralize decision making power, rapidly enact rules and regulations including clearly coercive and civil liberties-limiting policies, were central to China's SARS response, these actions were accompanied by reliance on a traditional communist tool that proved highly effective -the mobilization campaign.

And yet despite these clear disparities, data from the World Values Survey reveals that 62 percent of Chinese express either a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the press, whereas only 40.9 percent of Taiwanese express similar confidence levels. 25 Because the mass media market in Taiwan is extremely competitive, many media outlets depend on sensationalist journalism to capture market share. Drawing on this point, Ku and Wang argue that Taiwan's media were crucial to creating an atmosphere of mass hysteria about SARS. Rumours and hearsay were repeated throughout the day during the early part of the second stage of the Taiwan outbreak. Panicking frontline health workers demanding to be released from treating SARS patients were given prominent media attention, thereby increasing public panic and demoralization, as well as distrust of state initiatives and reassurances [17] .",

At the outset of SARS, the central government clamped down on any reporting, denying the public access to information on developments. This initial approach fomented rumour and panic. However, as the epidemic spread, this approach was replaced by mass media saturation with information about SARS and how to identify symptoms of the disease. Discussion of the SARS epidemic in the media began with public statements by Premier Wen Jiabao calling the situation grave. And in an effort to illustrate their engagement with, and commitment to society's welfare, Wen Jiabao was joined by President Hu Jintao on a travel and media blitz to rally the country in the fight against SARS, describing the disease as requiring 'prompt and resolute' measures. China's media outlets provided daily statistics on the disease as well as descriptions of government and grassroots containment efforts. While focusing on keeping the public informed about the disease and its prevention, the media also sought to convey the message that the disease was surmountable. 26 To this point, China exhibits a clear advantage in pandemic response arising from the authoritarian advantage: it is able to effectively centralize decision making power, and engage and mobilize the public and the media. But as noted, an alternative explanation frequently raised in Taiwan is that Taiwan's international isolation played a major role in its underperformance with regards to SARS. I turn here to consideration of this argument.",

In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (on Taiwan) at the WHO. Thereafter, WHO officials ceased all direct interaction with Taiwan. Now described as a province of the PRC, Taiwan was expected to access the WHO only through the PRC government. Since the change in status, Taiwan's health officials and medical professionals have been excluded from the WHO, its forums and workshops on important issues ranging from diagnosis, monitoring and controlling newly emerging infectious diseases. Thus, Taiwan no longer has access to pandemic surveillance, risk assessment and early warning information that is provided by the Pandemic Influenza Program Intergovernmental Meetinga WHO service available only to member states. Furthermore, it cannot access WHO virus samples and equipment stockpiles. 27 Taiwan officials note that during the SARS outbreak, China blocked cooperation and information sharing between the WHO and Taiwan. Taiwan health professionals seeking information from the WHO were told by the WHO to request it from Beijing, a politically difficult option (Brown 2003; Taiwan MoH). Another option was to obtain data from the WHO website. However, according to Chen Yuan-Tsong -2003 director of the institute of Bio-Medical Sciences at Academia Sinica -'by the time the information is in the public domain, it is probably out of date' [18] .",

Also, eventually the PRC permitted two WHO investigators to visit Taiwan, though they were forbidden to interact with Taiwan government officials. However, despite these visits and the resultant access to information, the challenge lay in how the information, once received, was handled. Unclear lines of control and confusion in the bureaucracy resulted in the Taiwan government failing to effectively convey information down the bureaucratic lines of control. As a result, doctors and hospital administrators claimed that the majority of SARS-related information they received derived not from the USCDC or WHO as conveyed via the Taiwan government, but rather directly from the WHO website.",
