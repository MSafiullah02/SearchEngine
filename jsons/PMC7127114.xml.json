            "text": "The \u201cInterferon family\u201d includes cytokines with non-specific antiviral, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Specifically, type I interferons (IFN) include IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 e IFN-\u03c9 (Wonderling et al., 2002). Type I IFNs are produced by virus-infected cells and interact with specific receptors on adjacent cells, which are induced to transcribe genes coding for antiviral proteins. As a consequence, viral replication and viral protein synthesis decrease (Ueda et al., 1993b, Uchino, 1995, Tilg, 1997, Stark et al., 1998, Wonderling et al., 2002). Type II interferons include IFN-\u03b3 (Wonderling et al., 2002), produced by T-lymphocytes and NK cells. IFN-\u03b3 has a prevalent immunomodulatory activity, characterized by the activation of macrophages, T-lymphocytes, NK cells and, to a lesser extent, of B cells (Mond et al., 1986, Bohem et al., 1997). Several virus types have been demonstrated to modulate IFN production (Uchino, 1995, Stark et al., 1998). Moreover, the administration of exogenous IFNs in a population with high prevalence of viral diseases or during the early phase of viral infection inhibits viral replication. Thus, the administration of IFNs may demonstrate a prophylactic effect or may prevent the worsening of certain viral diseases (Truyen et al., 2002). The administration of exogenous human IFN does not induce severe side effects in cats (M\u00fcller, 2002), but, as an exogenous antigen, induces the production of neutralizing antibodies with inhibition of the therapeutic effects of the active principle (Zeidner et al., 1990, M\u00fcller, 2002). The administration of a species-specific feline IFN is able to by-pass this problem (M\u00fcller, 2002, Truyen et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Recombinant feline IFN-\u03c9 (rFeIFN) has 65% homology with human IFNs (Ueda et al., 1993b), and has antiviral, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties similar to that of human IFN-\u03c9 (Ueda et al., 1993a, Ueda et al., 1993b). In vitro, rFeIFN has a proven antiviral effect against several viruses including parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus and rotavirus (Mochizuki et al., 1994, M\u00fcller, 2002, Truyen et al., 2002). In vivo, rFeIFN has been mainly used in dogs with experimental or spontaneous parvoviral infections, with consequent clinical improvement, normalization of CBC results and reduction of the mortality rate (Ishiwata et al., 1998, Minagawa et al., 1999, Martin et al., 2002). In dogs, rFeIFN has also been successfully used, associated with vaccination, to prevent outbreaks of canine parvovirosis (Uchino, 1995). The efficacy of rFeIFN in cats with feline infectious peritonitis, or infected with feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus and feline calicivirus has also been reported (Uchino, 1995, Mihaljevic, 2003, De Mari et al., 2004, Ishida et al., 2004). However, no data on the effect of rFeIFN in cases of spontaneous feline panleukopenia (FP), caused by the feline parvovirus (FPV), are available. The administration of rFeIFN in kittens with FP seems not to influence the course of the disease (personal observations). Nevertheless, in the case rFeIFN would modulate inflammatory or immune response, the administration of rFeIFN may be integrated in conventional therapies or it may be considered for prophylactic plans against FP in catteries.",

The incomplete collection of material as a consequence of the high temperatures, the long lapse time from death and collection of samples, did not allow the demonstration of FPV in all cats included. Nevertheless, the clinical signs recorded were consistent with acute forms of FP, and necropsies and histology confirmed this diagnosis in the nine cats that could be examined. These findings, coupled with our knowledge regarding FPV ecology, epidemiology and clinical presentation, together with the finding of specific anti-FPV IgM, which are produced during acute phase of infection, allowed us to conclude that FP was present in the cattery, and likely affected all cats.",

The lack of inflammatory changes in symptomatic controls may be the consequence of the hyperacute course of the disease although, in experimentally induced inflammation AGP increases within 24 h (Kajikawa et al., 1999). Most cats included in the present study died within few hours from the appearance of clinical signs or, in some cases, were found in pre-agonic or agonic state, thus, probably before the possible increase of circulating AGP. The concentration of AGP and of \u03b1-globulins (the electrophoretic fraction on which AGP and other acute phase proteins migrate) in treated cats was lower than in controls, suggesting that rFeIFN treatment depressed the so called \u201cacute phase reaction\u201d, most likely trough its possible influence on the \u201ccytokine network\u201d responsible for the systemic response to inflammation. On the contrary, rFeIFN administration did not induce significant changes in \u03b3-globulins or in total and FPV specific antibody classes. However, this should not be considered surprising, since the interval between the last treatment and the blood samplings was too low (3\u20138 days) to evidence changes in these parameters. Nevertheless, the analysis of individual data indicated that most cats from the treated group had higher levels of IgM and higher anti-FPV IgM titres compared with untreated cats, thus, suggesting that, in spite of the short delay mentioned above, cats from the treated group were mounting an early IgM-mediated immune-response against FPV. The mechanism by which rFeIFN exerts this effect cannot be inferred from this study. However, the hypothesis that rFeIFN stimulates an immune system response was confirmed by the results obtained on day 32, when treated cats had a more intense response to the vaccinal trial, with higher levels of \u03b3-globulins, total and FPV specific IgG compared to control cats.",

In treated and in controls kittens, the viral spread caused similar morbidity and mortality rates. However, due to the limits of \u201cin field\u201d studies it is not possible to conclude that rFeIFN does not have an immunotherapeutic role in FPV. On the contrary, treated animals seem to have a more reactive immune system (as demonstrated by the vaccinal trial) and a reduced acute inflammatory responsiveness. This powerful immunomodulatory activity suggests that rFeIFN treatment of kittens 2 weeks prior to their introduction into a high risk environment, followed by vaccination, or preceded by the treatment of the queen to improve the transfer of passive maternal immunity, may provide kittens with a good level of IgG when exposed to the virus. This immunomodulatory effect should be taken into consideration when designing prophylactic schemes for the prevention of feline parvoviral outbreaks.",
