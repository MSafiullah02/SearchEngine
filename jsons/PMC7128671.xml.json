In a country as large as China, identification of the communicable diseases causing the greatest burden and the population groups most affected by specific diseases is a massive, and very important, undertaking. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Shigui Yang and colleagues report surveillance data for communicable diseases in China over a 10-year period (2004\u201313), covering a population of 1\u00b73 billion people and incorporating nearly 55 million notified cases of 45 infectious diseases.1\n",

SARS emerged from Guangdong province in southern China, resulting in 5327 cases and 348 deaths in mainland China and an estimated loss of US$25\u00b73 billion to China's economy.4, 5 In response, China overhauled its approach to public health surveillance and control, with substantial legislative changes, a ten-fold increase in public health funding from 2003 to 2012, and establishment of the largest web-based communicable diseases reporting system in the world.4, 5 Another key feature of surveillance systems is data availability; the data analysed by Yang and colleagues were available publicly from the Public Health Science Data Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and from the official website of the National Health and Family Planning Commission.1 A review of notification data in China is timely in this new era of infectious diseases surveillance and publicly available data.",

Not surprisingly, the highest overall notification incidence was among children younger than 10 years, whereas case-fatality ratios increased with age. Males had higher notification incidence and case fatality ratios than did females, indicating a need to target men in preventive and control activities. Wang and colleagues' analyses of seasonality for each of the 45 infectious diseases and notification incidence by province can be used to inform targeted public health interventions by location and season.",

Case ascertainment\u2014the proportion of all incident symptomatic cases captured by the surveillance system\u2014varies by disease, location, time, age, and sex.6 Improved case ascertainment could account for some of the noted increase in overall notification incidence (on average, 6\u00b72% per year from 2004 to 2008 and 2\u00b73% per year from 2009 to 2013),1 including improvements in the surveillance system and notification process early in the study period. Importantly, 20 infectious diseases, including several vaccine-preventable diseases, showed significantly decreasing incidence over the study period, adding to substantial reductions reported in China from 1970 to 2007.4 China is participating in the WHO Western Pacific Region goals for polio and measles elimination and hepatitis B control and has made tremendous progress towards these goals. 20 cases of polio were reported among 1\u00b73 billion people over a decade, and incidence is now zero.1 The prevalence of hepatitis B among young children has declined strikingly, with China achieving the WHO regional target of less than 1% HBsAg seropositivity among children younger than 5 years before the target date.7 As these children reach adulthood, there will be a profound fall in hepatitis B incidence and associated disease burden. Surveillance data for measles show similar progress but at subnational scales. Measles incidence has declined for age groups in which people have been vaccinated since the elimination goal was declared.8\n",
