            "text": "Background An effective prevention strategy for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) has yet to be established. We previously reported that the innate immune system via the toll-like receptor (TLR) response induced by corticosteroids leads to the development of ONFH and that repression of IRF7 activity by an inhibitor could interfere with the development of ONFH while maintaining the therapeutic effect of the corticosteroids. Objective In the present study, we hypothesize that lansoprazole has the potential to suppress IRF7 activity and prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in rats. Furthermore, we conducted a preliminary clinical trial to prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in autoimmune disease patients. Methods Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups. On Day 1, each rat was injected with TLR4 ligand (LPS) or TLR7 ligand (imiquimod), followed by methylprednisolone with or without lansoprazole on Day 2. They were killed at 1 or 14 days after the last injection.We prospectively recruited 30 patients requiring primary high-dose corticosteroid treatment for immune diseases. All patients were administered lansoprazole, starting the night before corticosteroid treatment began. MRI was performed before corticosteroid treatment, and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks afterward. Results In rats, co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids significantly repressed both IRF7 activity and the development of ONFH. Moreover, in the human patients, the incidence of ONFH was significantly decreased from 53.4 to 13.3%. Conclusions Although the present study is preliminary, the results show that co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids prevents ONFH development. Lansoprazole may be both safe and effective in preventing osteonecrosis of the femoral head in patients needing corticosteroid treatment.",

We also reported an alcohol-induced ONFH rat model and that the TLR4 signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced ONFH [10] . Furthermore, we reported that ONFH results from the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) via the TLR signaling pathways, followed by a subsequent repression in NF-\u03baB activity by corticosteroid treatment, whereas IRF7 activity is unaffected by corticosteroid treatment. Further, the suppression of IRF7 activity by the use of an inhibitor, BAY11-7082, could interfere with the development of ONFH while maintaining the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids [9] . However, as rats co-administered with BAY11-7082 and corticosteroids showed high mortality, BAY11-7082 may be unsafe for human use. As new drug development requires an enormous amount of time and money, drug repositioning has been attracting a good deal of attention in recent years [11, 12] .",

All patients required primary high-dose prednisolone treatment for immune diseases and were recruited in the departments of Gastroenterology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology of Sapporo Medical University Hospital in Sapporo, Japan, between July 2011 and September 2014. Inclusion criteria required a prednisolone dose of 35 mg/day or more and an age of 20-75 years. Exclusion criteria were as follows: current ONFH, hip joint disease requiring surgery, alcohol-abuse, dementia, past allergy to LPZ, and treatment with atazanavir sulfate. All 31 patients recruited provided written informed consent.",

Subsequently, all were administered LPZ (Takepron \u00ae OD 30 mg, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited) orally once a day for 25 days. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hips was performed before corticosteroid treatment, and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks thereafter using a GE Signa HDx 1.5 T (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and fat suppression images on the axial and coronal plane were obtained. A low signal intensity band on T1-weighted images was defined as ONFH. Two trained orthopedists and a trained radiologist assessed all radiographs. One patient was excluded because of a physical condition that precluded the MRI at 12 weeks. ONFH was diagnosed using the classifications for the osteonecrosis of the femoral head of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare [19] , in which Type A lesion occupies the medial one-third or less of the weight-bearing portion, Type B lesion occupies the medial two-thirds or less of the weight-bearing portion, Type C1 and Type C2 lesions both occupy more than the medial twothirds of the weight-bearing portion, with Type C2 lesions extending laterally to the acetabular edge, whereas Type C1 lesions do not. The margins of the necrotic areas were determined as a low signal intensity band at the coronal slice of the center of the femoral head on the T1-weighted images. Table 1 shows patient demographic data including age, gender, underlying diseases, maximal daily prednisolone dosage, total prednisolone dosage within 3 months, days of corticosteroid treatment at 1000 mg/day, and occurrence of ONFH. The patients consisted of 17 men and 13 women (mean age 54.9 years). The underlying diseases were IgG4related disease (n = 14), dermatomyositis (n = 8), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 5), and others (n = 3). The maximal mean prednisolone dosage was 46.0 (35-60) mg/ day, excluding 3 days of treatment at 1000 mg/day in two patients.",

            "text": "It has been reported that innate immune signaling via TLR pathways contributes to the pathogenesis of underlying diseases in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH [8, 9] . Consequently, we previously reported that corticosteroid treatment after TLR4, TLR7 or TLR9 ligand injection induces ONFH in Wistar rats and that ONFH results from the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF7 via the MyD88-dependent pathway, followed by a subsequent repression in NF-\u03baB activity by corticosteroid treatment, whereas IRF7 activity is unaffected by corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, suppression of IRF7 activity using BAY11-7082, Ikk-\u03b1 inhibitor and Ikk-\u03b2 inhibitor with the potential to inhibit NF-\u03baB and IRF7 activity [22] interferes with the development of ONFH [9] . Thus, we believe that a proinflammatory response induced by corticosteroids leads to the development of ONFH. However, as the safety of BAY11-7082 has not been approved for humans, its clinical application is difficult. Therefore, we explored the use of an approved, commercially available drug, which has the potential to suppress IRF7 activity. It has been reported that LPZ exerts anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines via the suppression of NF-\u03baB activity [14] . Consequently, we hypothesized that LPZ also inhibits IRF7 activity and prevents ONFH development in rats, and this study showed that LPZ significantly suppressed IRF7 activity in the LPS + LPZ + MPSL and imiquimod + LPZ + MPSL groups compared with that in the LPS + MPSL and imiquimod + MPSL groups. This is consistent with previous reports on the effect of BAY11-7082 [9] and confirms that LPZ inhibits IRF7 activity. Further, NF-\u03baB activity was significantly suppressed in the LPS + LPZ + MPSL group only. We previously reported that corticosteroid treatment suppressed NF-\u03baB activity in imiquimod + MPSL rats compared with that in imiquimod + Saline rats [7] . This result indicates that LPS activates NF-\u03baB activity more than does imiquimod. Therefore, NF-\u03baB activity was significantly suppressed by LPZ treatment, and the cotreatment of LPZ with corticosteroids prevents the development of ONFH in rats. The results of the experimental study indicate that LPZ may also prevent the development of ONFH in patients with immune diseases needing corticosteroid treatment.",

Although clinical studies about prevention for ONFH by statin therapy and anti-coagulant were reported [26, 27] , there are no standard preventive methods today. Unfortunately, no effective prevention strategy for ONFH has been clinically established. In the present study, LPZ also prevented the development of corticosteroid-induced ONFH in a clinical study. However, ONFH did develop in four patients, although not in any rats. Patients were administered with LPZ at the approved dosage, suggesting the necessity to reconsider the dosage and usage period of LPZ.",

Six months after treatment, the ONFH lesion had decreased in size. The left femoral head ONFH lesion disappeared at 12 months after corticosteroid treatment and the right femoral head ONFH lesion disappeared at 15 months after corticosteroid treatment the observation period. Reports exist of ONFH lesions, observed by MRI, regressing spontaneously over several years [28] [29] [30] [31] . These reports studied specific diseases, such as renal recipients, severe acute respiratory syndrome and SLE, so there is a possibility that specific treatments were provided for each group of patients. The present study could not determine whether the disappearance of ONFH was due to its natural course or the effects of LPZ, and ONFH patients need to be observed in a future clinical study.",

First, it was unclear whether the pharmacological effect of LPZ as prevention agent for osteonecrosis in rat models can be transferred to humans and there have been no reports to date. Second, the sample size was small, and it was a single-center and historically controlled study. Further, there were differences in underlying diseases in this study group from those in past reports, particularly, as a large number of patients with IgG4-related disease were included in this study. This is due to the high rate of patients treated for IgG4-related disease in our hospital. Furthermore, there was some bias in terms of underlying diseases between the study and control groups. Last, we could not evaluate transcriptional factor activity in the patients. Nevertheless, our clinical trial did show a decrease in the incidence of ONFH in our institute.",

Moreover, LPZ also prevents ONFH development in immune disease patients treated with corticosteroids, although the study was only preliminary. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct a multicenter clinical trial with large sample size. Nevertheless, we believe that LPZ is safe to use and could be effective in preventing osteonecrosis of the femoral head in patients needing corticosteroid treatment. We anticipate that further clinical trials will show that this protocol is both consistent and reproducible.",
