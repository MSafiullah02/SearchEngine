            "text": "Bats comprise nearly 1200 species and constitute \u224820% of living mammal species and are distributed on all continents except Antarctic, Artic and a few islands (Simmons, 2005). Due to their unique (only flying mammals) and diverse lifestyles, bats differ from other sylvatic disease mammalian reservoirs and are predisposed for the acquisition and maintenance of viruses (Hayman et al., 2013). During the past two decades, bats (Chiroptera) have been identified as the reservoir host of a number of high-impact zoonotic viruses known to induce highly lethal diseases in humans and domestic animals (Brook and Dobson, 2015). They have been associated with emerging Paramyxovirus (Nipah and hendra viruses), Coronavirus (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and Filovirus (Ebola and Marburg viruses) (Smith and Wang, 2013) which attracted global attention due to their severity and/or large-scale spread. Those emergences have been caused by the ever-increasing interfaces between domestic animals, people and bat communities created by current global and human changes (Brierley et al., 2016). Human activities that increase exposure to bats induce new and more infectious contacts between species and promote the spill over of unknown pathogens from bats to other animals. The identification of the reservoir species is key for the control of these emerging infectious diseases in order to prevent/manage practices at risk of pathogens spill over.",

            "text": "Although numerous studies have been implemented on bat-borne viruses around the world, large gaps still exists concerning the viral diversity among Chiroptera especially in some regions that attracted little disease research until now. The Republic of Zimbabwe is situated southern Africa in the subtropical zone and has an exceptional great diversity of wildlife. To date more than 60 bat species have been recorded in Zimbabwe (Monadjem et al., 2010). Accordingly, Zimbabwe represents a potential hot spot for future emergence of microorganisms from bats that can transmit infections to humans and livestock (Morse et al., 2012). Many cases of rabies, anthrax, African swine fever and foot and mouth diseases have been recorded in the last 20 years. Furthermore, Lyssavirus were demonstrated in bats (Duvenhage virus) and in cats and dogs (Mokola Virus, Lagos bat virus) (Bingham et al., 2001; Foggin, 1982). In the 1970s, a traveller who passed through Zimbabwe was probably infected with the Marburg virus after visiting the Chinhoyi caves about 135 km northwest of Harare, capital of Zimbabwe (Peterson et al., 2006). We report here the first evidence of circulation of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus in Hipposideros bat species in Zimbabwe.",

Briefly, two sample tubes from the same plastic sheet were pooled and transferred in a 50 ml tube with 20 ml of PBS 1\u00d7 then vigorously mixed. All together we made 73 (51 in June 2016 and 22 in February 2017) pools from Mabura cave and 50 (35 in June 2016 and 15 in February 2017) pools from Magweto cave respectively. Tubes were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was filtered using gauze in order to eliminate faecal matter and transferred in fresh tubes then re-centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter to remove eukaryotic and bacterial sized particles. Seven millilitres of filtered samples were centrifuged at 250,000 g for 2.5 h at 4 \u00b0C. The pellets were re-suspended in 600 \u03bcl H20 molecular grade and 150 \u03bcl were used to extract RNA using NucleoSpin\u00ae RNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 123 RNA samples extracted from the pools were then reverse transcribed using random hexamers and screened for Coronavirus (CoV) and Paramyxovirus (ParV) as previously described employing a pan-coronavirus and pan-paramyxovirus nested RT-PCR directed against partial polymerase RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdPd) and polymerase gene sequences, respectively (Chu et al., 2011; Tong et al., 2008). PCR products (415 bp for CoV and 531 bp for ParV) were agarose gel purified (Geneclean Turbo Kit, MP Biomedicals, France) and directly sequenced in both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 directions using cycle sequencing and dye terminator methodologies (Eurofins, Germany). Overlapping sequences were assembled into contiguous sequences using SEQMAN DNASTAR software (lasergene, DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Partial non-concatenated nucleic acid sequences of the new Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus as well as from Cytochrome B were aligned using MEGA 7 (Kumar et al., 2016), with minor manual adjustments. Sites that could not be unambiguously aligned were excluded and divergent regions were excluded from subsequent analyses. Phylogenies were inferred using both Bayesian methods and Maximum Likelihood (ML) method implemented in MrBayes v3.2.6 and in PhyML respectively (Guindon et al., 2010; Ronquist et al., 2012). Mr. Bayes ran for four million generations for Coronavirus RdRp and Paramyxovirus polymerase genes, respectively, with a 10% burn-in. Bayesian parameters were examined with the Tracer program (Tracer, 2003). Convergence diagnostic for the Estimated sample Size (ESS) values and Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF) were >500 and equal to 1 respectively. In ML method, the reliability of branching orders was tested using the bootstrap approach (1000 replicates). The suited evolution model (GTR + \u03934 + I for Coronavirus and Cytochrome B, and GTR + \u03934 for Paramyxovirus) was selected by Akaie's Information criterion (AIC) using Topali software (Milne et al., 2009). From both phylogenetic analyses, similar tree topologies were obtained (data not shown). Identities analyses were done using ClustalX (Larkin et al., 2007).",

Nonetheless, during the second visit we observed a consequent diminution of bats present in the cave and our sampling was lower than expected. This could be due to Hipposideros spp. seasonal movement. Besides, the absence of Alphacoronavirus could also be due to temporal variation in virus shedding in bats (Plowright et al., 2015).",

Our study focused on two caves in Zimbabwe with an important bat-human interface throughout guano harvesting and/or bats poaching. Non-invasive sampling provides a rapid approach to target site of interest for in-depth studies on virus prevalence in bats and temporal variation in virus shedding in bats (viral ecology) and provides a first risk assessment of the transmission of bat-borne pathogens to humans. Finally, our study will enable, in agreement with the local health authorities, to carry out a specific communication within the local populations on the risk of contamination and how to prevent it.",
