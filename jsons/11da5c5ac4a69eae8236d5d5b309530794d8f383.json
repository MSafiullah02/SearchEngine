Novel technologies now allow video links, interactive resources, and electronic evaluations to be distributed by SMS (text) messages. Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease might be at particular risk from coronavirus disease 2019 . In the UK, advice for patients with these conditions has been coordinated by Public Health England, focusing on a high-risk group that requires strict social isolation (\"shielding\"). 1,2 Rheumatologists were presented with a 40-component physician-scored tool to risk-stratify patients under follow-up by the British Society for Rheumatology. They were also requested to advise patients on therapy, such as corticosteroid use, during sickness. A particular challenge in the UK highlighted by regulatory authorities is that, despite the use of electronic patient records, data about rheumatology patients are fragmented (prescriptions for biologics and some diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs are electronically coded in secondary care patient records and comorbidities in primary care records), preventing centralised national identification of at-risk groups. 3 Modern e-learning publishing platforms-which are already in use in education of health professionals-allow publication, distribution, and user metrics of multimedia resources sent via a single, sharable web-link. We present a proof of principle for this new methodology, already at use in our hospital, 4 used as a means of informing and educating patients in a large secondary care rheumatology service in the UK.",

The educational content was adapted from physician-led national guidance, 1,2 and included a simple 4-step risk score along with other advice. This method allowed patients to self-identify if they were at high risk (ie, that they should classify themselves as in the \"shielding\" group). 3 We developed a series of iterations, encompassing changing national guidance, piloted and shared with rheumatologists, our patient participation group, and a national charity. The final iteration included the score, an animated worked example, and information from regulatory bodies and specialist societies. 4 We used an established educational e-learning tool to record and publish our online video (iSpring Suite, iSpring Solutions, 2019). 5 For patient contact, we used an existing database of mobile phone numbers that had already been used to send SMS messages to our rheumatology cohort in the past 12 months (March 22, 2019, to March 22, 2020).",

A subset of patients (n=200) was asked about their experiences in more detail, along with age and sex; we limited the sample size because of concerns we had about completion rates for longer questionnaires. We sent the SMS-linked video on day 4 after the national request to contact patients in rheumatology services. 2 Data were collated at day 6, and we analysed responses in line with established methodology. 6 Our main objective was to enable patients to self-score, and the pragmatic pri mary outcome measure was self-reported ability to risk-stratify.",

Unlike more costly paper communication, our video information was revised to reflect evolving national guidance and feedback, always using the same link. 4 Some elements are of particular interest for rheumatologists during the COVID-19 pandemicfor example, targeting advice to specific groups, such as patients taking tocilizumab or hydroxychloroquine.

The population is representative of our wider cohort in terms of age and sex. 9 Nonetheless, we have concerns that some of the most vulnerable patients might not have been reachable with this intervention, particularly those without mobile phones or internet access. To try to mitigate this limitation, we made these resources accessible on our departmental web pages, although the uptake there was small. We have received feedback from patients with lower literacy and dyslexia who found our SMSlinked video intervention more helpful than more traditional health-care communication as written text. This innovation was done alongside traditional methods of hand searching biologics registries and drug monitoring systems (for which we had several thousand patients in our cohort). The \"shielding\" letters to the highest risk groups identified by our manual record search were posted only by day 12, illustrating the delays inherent in traditional approaches. Our methodology might be subject to response bias, with only those patients who benefited choosing to complete our survey. Our response rate is within the expected ranges for this type of survey. 10 For the estimated 15% of our follow-up cohort that do not have an inflammatory autoimmune rheumatic disease that did receive our video, 9 we included other generic advice, such as analgesic use.",
