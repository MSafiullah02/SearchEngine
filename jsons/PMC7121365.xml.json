The mode of transmission of CAP is usually person-to-person via water or mucus droplets laden with viruses or bacteria. The most frequent pathogens are Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) and Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae and atypical bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. In addition, respiratory viruses, such as the influenza viruses, the human meta pneumovirus (hMPV), the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and corona viruses may also cause CAP.

L. pneumophila and Chlamydia infections are more common in patients with some form of mild immunologic compromise. Patients with poor oral hygiene and occasional loss of consciousness (epilepsy, alcoholism) may suffer from anaerobic pulmonary infections. In addition, in these patients, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is more prevalent compared with in healthy persons without risk factors. Recurrent pneumonia in outpatients usually indicates some sort of underlying problem, such as congenital or acquired immunologic disorder; airway abnormalities, such as chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchogenic carcinoma; cardiac problems (congestive heart failure); or systemic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic alcoholism, and intravenous drug abuse. Up to 10% of CAP are aspiration pneumonias caused by aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal or gastric contents. The most frequently isolated pathogens in aspiration pneumonia are Gram-negative bacteria. Aspiration pneumonia must be differentiated from aspiration pneumonitis, which is a chemical pneumonitis that results from the aspiration of noncolonized gastric contents (Mendelson\u2019s syndrome).",

Because the clinical symptoms are nonspecific (most people who have fever and cough do not have pneumonia), the chest radiograph is one of the most important tools in the diagnosis of CAP. The radiographic identification of pulmonary opacities is, in the appropriate clinical setting, indicative of pneumonia. Conversely, a patient who has fever and cough but does not have radiographic evidence of pneumonia can be considered to be free of pneumonia. In CAP, the causative organism is frequently not identified, because noninvasive tests such as sputum cultures correctly identify the offending organism in only 50% of cases, and invasive procedures are rarely used in these patients.",

A specific etiologic diagnosis, however, is difficult to establish due to the increasing spectrum of causative organisms and their overlapping radiographic features. In a prospective study of 359 adults with CAP, Fang and coauthors compared the radiographic, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with bacterial pneumonia (caused by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli) with features from patients with atypical pneumonia (caused by M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp.). The authors found no features that could reliably differentiate these groups. Another group prospectively compared the clinical and radiologic features of CAP caused by L. pneumophila to those of patients with pneumococcal infections.

Sources of infections are hospital personnel and patients with active infections.

If present, these symptoms may not necessarily be caused by pneumonia.

PCP typically presents with increasing shortness of breath and may run a gradual or fulminant course. Chest films classically reveal a bilateral fine to medium reticulonodular pattern, generally bilateral but occasionally focal or unilateral. If the patient remains untreated, the radiograph progressively becomes more opaque and ultimately bilateral homogeneous opacities may be seen. Upper-lobe involvement was seen more commonly when inhaled pentamidine prophylactic therapy was used. The chest film may worsen within a few days of intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment secondary to overhydration and the production of pulmonary edema, but this can be treated with diuretics. Otherwise, with treatment, the radiographic course is one of steady improvement until by day 11, complete resolution may be seen. In approximately 10% of patients, pneumatoceles may develop. These are frequently in the upper lobes and will resolve within 2 months. However, they may also lead to pneumothorax, which can be extremely difficult to treat. Pneumothorax is seen in 5% of patients with PCP and AIDS. In about 10% of patients, the chest film may be normal. In some of these patients with normal radio graphs, a CT scan will show the typical geographic appearance of ground-glass opacities associated with PCP.

In the setting of immunosuppression (neutropenia), the typical appearance is that of invasive aspergillosis. In this form of disease, the chest film initially demonstrates a poorly marginated area or areas of homogeneous opacity that may resemble ordinary bacterial pneumonia in appearance and distribution but is occasionally more round and distant from the subpleural lung than common community infections. In some cases, the disease is peripheral and wedge-shaped secondary to infarction caused by the angioinvasive obstruction of pulmonary vessels. In time, the lesions become more discreet and round, thus taking on the look of lung masses. As patients are treated and immune status improves, there may be cavitation within the masses with the formation of an air crescent. Wall thickness of the cavity is generally moderate. The air crescent is created by the contained necrotic debris within the cavity. On CT, initially, the areas of homogeneous opacity may have air bronchograms, and commonly, additional regions of involvement are identified. A halo sign may be observed, which is caused by ground-glass opacity that surrounds (frequently incompletely) a more opaque center of the lesion. The groundglass portion is an area of hemorrhage and the central area is necrotic lung. The halo sign was thought to be pathognomonic of invasive aspergillosis but can be seen with other infections, neoplasms, and inflammatory diseases.",

The presence of an appropriate lung opacity on a chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia. Extensive knowledge of the radiographic appearances of pulmonary infections, their complications, and their course is essential in aiding the referring clinician and ultimately the patient. CT imaging is useful in patients with CAP and NP when there is an unresolving or complicated chest film and at times in immunocompromised patients with suspected pulmonary infections. CT can help differentiate infectious from noninfectious abnormalities. CT may detect empyema, cavitation, and lymphadenopathy when chest films cannot. CT should be performed in immunocompromised patients with a clinical suspicion of pneumonia when the chest film is normal. This is especially true when the early diagnosis of pneumonia is critical, as is the case with immunocompromised and severely ill patients.",
