            "text": "Asia, with its vast population distributed across many countries with varied political systems, faces the challenge of rising tobacco consumption. The tobacco industry regards Asia's economic and demographic growth as a business opportunity to expand its trade. Public health and development activists have mobilised social action to counter this threat and contain the health and economic costs of tobacco in the region. Although global efforts for tobacco control are now better aligned, with the highest number of tobacco users worldwide, Asia is at the frontline of the tobacco epidemic. Campaigns to curb the epidemic must succeed in this region if the world aspires to be free from tobacco in the 21st century.",

In Hong Kong, the then-British colonial government benefited from the experience of tobacco control measures in the UK, and noted the measures introduced in Singapore. The Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (the first government-funded council in Asia) was established in 1987, the same year that Hong Kong banned manufacture, importation, and sale of smokeless tobacco, being only the second jurisdiction to do so.",

Commensurate with the global experience of that time, most early laws were neither sufficiently specific nor comprehensive, or they had loopholes. For example, many early bans on promotion only specified tobacco advertising, and not the full range of marketing, such as sponsorship; these laws had to be progressively revised and strengthened. Early educational messages were poorly funded (by comparison with the sophisticated advertisements of the tobacco industry), clumsy, technical, and difficult for the general public to understand. Asia has shown that tobacco control is not the prerogative of high-income countries, and that Asian nations\u2014including low-income and middle-income countries\u2014can grasp the political nettle of tobacco control, and can do so effectively.",

Only Thailand challenged the Trade Representative: full paper advertisements were taken out in US newspapers; congressional hearings were held in Washington DC in 1990, when several Asian public health officials (including JM) testified; and international opinion was mobilised. In adjudication of the case, the US General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade ruled that Thailand's importation ban was not justified, but nevertheless, Thailand could maintain its law banning advertising and promotion, and could introduce other tobacco control measures as long as they were applied to domestic and imported products equally.2\n",

Although this finding was of extreme concern at the time, it galvanised Asia's tobacco control advocates and was the most instrumental factor toward an early understanding of the need to address political, economic, environmental, and trade components, and the need to tackle the tobacco industry and its supporters head-on.

Up to now, only seven countries in Asia apply high excise and other tax at more than 70% of cigarette price.11\n",

Since 1980, rates of smoking in men have halved in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore. Smoking in women has not increased to the extent predicted in the 1980s. This finding is particularly surprising because Asian women have become more independent, have greater purchasing power, and are less likely to follow admonitions from authority, teachers, and parents than they have been previously. However, such changes should not give rise to complacency and increases in smoking in girls in Asia are a particular concern.16\n",

In 1989, he founded and funded APACT at a time when Asian countries were rarely in contact with one another. APACT, in coordination with WHO, organises major regional tobacco control conferences in Asia every 2\u20133 years: Taiwan (1989), Republic of Korea (1991), Japan (1993), Thailand (1995), the Philippines (1998), Hong Kong (2001), Republic of Korea (2004), Taipei (2007), Australia (2010), and Japan (2013), with participants from countries as diverse as Australia, New Zealand, Mongolia, and Laos. Second, JM founded the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control (ACTC) in 1990, as a coordinating organisation to help with the sharing of information, experience, and expertise about tobacco control among countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Third, BR established the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Association (SEATCA) in 2001. Building on common goals to curb the tobacco epidemic in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), SEATCA progressively forged partnerships and collaborations with governmental and non-governmental organisations, research institutions, and WHO in most ASEAN countries\u2014namely, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. SEATCA organises strategic programmes, including capacity building, research, and policy advocacy aiming to foster tobacco control policy and strengthen implementation of WHO's Framework Convention.23\n",

A new framework is needed to address the health epidemics of the 21st century, moving from a purely medical perspective to a perspective that incorporates political, economic, and financial considerations. Challenges remain, including the association and conflict of interest between governments and national monopolies in countries such as China, the scarce amounts of funding, the continuing legal challenges launched against governments undertaking tobacco control, and meeting of WHO's global monitoring target of reduced prevalence by 2025 and of obligations within WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the Protocol on Illicit Trade.",
