About 50\u201380% of episodes are caused by viruses, most notably rotaviruses or noroviruses, which are the leading cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis among children (9, 10). Children infected with rotavirus may experience 10\u201320 bowel movements per day and vomiting for periods of 24 h or longer; consequently, dehydration is a major concern. Young children are particularly at risk of dehydration because of their higher surface\u2010to\u2010volume ratio, higher metabolic rate, smaller fluid reserves and their dependency on others for fluid intake. Rotavirus illness is difficult to prevent because it is easily transmitted (e.g. between family members in the home, and between children in preschool or day\u2010care settings); furthermore, children can be infected more than once (11). Therefore, implementing a vaccination program to protect against more severe subsequent infections represents an ideal means of preventing moderate\u2010to\u2010severe rotavirus infections.",

The reduction in enzyme levels results in a failure to metabolize dietary carbohydrates with consequent osmotic diarrhoea. As shown in Figure 2, once rotavirus enters the small intestine, it attaches to glycolipids on the surface of the mature villous tip cells that line the small intestine. The virus invades the villous tip cells, causing villous atrophy, loss of digestive enzymes and a reduction of absorption. Once the villi become blunted, the resulting malabsorption of carbohydrates results in diarrhoea, which persists until the villi are regenerated.

Clinical signs of dehydration are detailed in Table 2. Knowledge of the physiology of fluid balance, particularly intestinal electrolyte and nutrient transport, provides a basis for understanding the mechanisms of acute diarrhoeal disease and the rationale for oral rehydration therapy. Water absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine, driven by osmotic gradients that depend on the transport of the electrolytes sodium and chloride, as well as nutrients such as glucose and amino acids. Sodium, glucose and several amino acids are absorbed through the apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells by a sodium\u2010dependent nutrient cotransporter system. Sodium is then transported from the cell across the basolateral membrane to the extracellular space by the enzyme Na+/K+\u2010ATPase. This enzyme utilizes energy to reduce the intracellular sodium concentration, which produces a negative extracellular electrical charge. The resultant electrochemical gradient facilitates sodium absorption by the epithelial cell, which drives the sodium\u2010dependent nutrient cotransporters. The anion chloride is absorbed to maintain electrical neutrality across the epithelium, and water is passively absorbed in response to the transport of these electrolytes and nutrients. Successful oral rehydration therapy with balanced sugar\u2013salt solutions depends upon these simple physiologic principles.",

Water passively follows the osmotic gradient generated by the transcellular transport of electrolytes and nutrients. Thus, the coupled transport of sodium and glucose molecules at the intestinal brush border is an essential requirement for ORS to work. Cotransport across the luminal membrane is facilitated by the protein, sodium\u2010glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). Once in the enterocyte, the transport of glucose into the blood is facilitated by GLUT2 (glucose transporter type 2) in the basolateral membrane.

In this regard it is generally well tolerated, more cost\u2010effective, and associated with fewer complications than the alternative of intravenous infusion therapy (28).

A systematic review of 14 randomized controlled trials to compare ORT and intravenous therapy concluded that there were no clinically important differences between ORT and intravenous therapy in terms of efficacy and safety (32). In a review of 17 trials comparing oral and intravenous rehydration in children with gastroenteritis, it was calculated that only one in every 25 children (95% CI 14\u2013100) would fail to respond to ORT and then require subsequent intravenous therapy (33).

Dietary management with a rice\u2010based diet containing either cooked green banana or pectin, in addition to their known colonotrophic effects, reduced the amount of stool, the need for ORS, and the duration of diarrhoea.

This was despite a large heterogeneity in the trials included in these analyses. However, the authors of these studies concluded that more research is needed to confirm the use of particular probiotic regimens in specific patient groups. Moreover, it has been argued that the beneficial effects of probiotics appear to be limited to a modest decrease in the duration of diarrhoea. In fact, in children less than 2 years of age with moderate to severe dehydrating diarrhoea, ORT plus Lactobacillus rhamnosus CG was no more effective than placebo in reducing the duration or severity of diarrhoea. This suggests that intestinal colonization must occur before benefits of probiotics can be realized (43).

            "text": "Racecadotril (acetorphan), an enkephalinase inhibitor, represents a promising new approach to the treatment of diarrhoea. The mechanism of action of racecadotril is shown in Figure 4. Water and electrolyte transport in the intestinal mucosa is regulated by local messengers (neuropeptides, amines, eicosanoids). Most of them act via the mediation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), activating or inhibiting its production from adenosine triphosphate. An increase in cAMP is induced by endogenous (e.g. VIP, PGE2) or exogenous agents (e.g. V. cholerae, E. coli toxins) and leads to net hypersecretion of water and electrolytes. Opiate neuropeptides are localized in the intestine myenteric and submucosal plexuses, where they modulate motility (mu receptors) and secretion (delta receptors). Activation of mu receptors prolongs intestinal transit while activation of delta receptors reduces intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes. Enkephalins activate delta receptors and inhibit adenylcyclase, thus facilitating a decrease in cAMP levels with a consequent reduction in water and electrolyte secretion. This antisecretory action, however, is brief because enkephalins are rapidly degraded by the membrane peptidase enkephalinase. Racecadotril is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed in man into the active metabolite tiorphan, which is a powerful and selective enkephalinase inhibitor. Thus, the antisecretory action of enkephalins is prolonged in the presence of tiorphan (47, 48). Furthermore, unlike opiates and loperamide, racecadotril does not act on mu receptors and therefore it does not prolong intestinal transit, nor does it favour bacterial growth in the small intestine (49).",

No significant differences were found in faecal output or duration of diarrhoea. However, there were differences in tolerance, with a lower incidence of constipation and fewer associated treatment modifications in the racecadotril group. The authors concluded that racecadotril and loperamide were equally effective in treating acute diarrhoea in these children, and racecadotril had a superior tolerability and safety profile.",

In patients positive for rotavirus, the duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter compared with placebo (median 30 h vs. 90 h; p = 0.0001). The intake of ORS was significantly lower in the racecadotril group than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Racecadotril was well tolerated with only seven patients reporting adverse effects, all of which were mild and transient.

Furthermore, the children receiving racecadotril needed fewer additional emergency department visits to manage the current bout of diarrhoea.

Racecadotril, reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea and stool volume in children aged 3\u201348 months. The latter outcome is particularly important since quantitative diarrhoea criteria are recommended by the WHO for the evaluation of therapeutic agents in the management of this disorder (55). None of the studies revealed any significant adverse effects resulting from the administration of racecadotril, although some minor adverse effects were observed. These results apply primarily to hospitalized children; the efficacy of the racecadotril may be different for other subgroups (e.g. outpatients compared with in\u2010patients). The authors of the review concluded that, in three relatively small randomized controlled trials (51, 52, 53) with some methodological problems, racecadotril was effective in reducing the volume and frequency of stool output and in reducing the duration of diarrhoea (particularly in infants with rotavirus).",
