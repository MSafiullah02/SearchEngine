            "text": "Global environmental challenges are now manifesting at a planetary scale in the form of climate change, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, environmental pollution, deforestation, and land-use change, among many others. These characteristics of the Anthropocene era have been driven by accelerating socioeconomic trends, including population growth, various measures of consumption and economic growth, urbanization, telecommunications, and other aspects of globalization. The so-called Great Acceleration, 1 which started in the 1950s, has been compounded by the rapid development and spread of information technologies and telecommunications. 2 Decades of international conferences and reports-beginning with the 1972 report The Limits to Growth by the Club of Rome and the United Nations (UN) Conference on the Human Development in that same year and evolving to the creation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the UN General Assembly in 2015-have warned of the challenges and risks associated with current development pathways and have fostered the evolution of sustainability science at the global scale ( Figure 1 ). Science has played a pivotal role in helping society to identify and understand the scope and scale of planetary environmental changes. It has also helped to guide policies and practices that address sustainability challenges from local to global scales. In recent years, global-scale challenges have become a growing concern. The 1990s saw the development of a number of global-change research programs and various environmental science initiatives, such as the World Climate Research Program, the International Geosphere Biosphere Program, Diversitas, the International Human Dimensions Program, and some attempted unification in the Earth Systems Science program. Sustainability science emerged from the recognition of a need to extend global-change research to seek solutions, which in turn requires multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. This is slowly moving further from the perceived hegemony of the disciplinary expert toward the transdisciplinary co-design and co-production of research. International science coordination and funding approaches have also evolved over the past decades, as promoted by the International Science Council, the Belmont Forum, and others. Many of the global-change programs merged into Future Earth in 2013. 3, 4 In 2018, a unified coordination of the natural and social sciences was advanced by the formation of the International Science Council through the merger of the International Science Union and the International Social Sciences Council. This year, the transdisciplinary Sustainability Research & Innovation Congress 2020 was planned to unite global researchers, industry practitioners, and world leaders to inspire action and promote sustainability transformation. Although the event is now postponed because of the coronavirus disease pandemic, its aim of cultivating a space for sustainability scholarship, innovation, collaboration, and action won't be delayed. Global-change research reflects a growing demand for research to become more impactful and solution oriented, as spelled out in the Future Earth vision, 5 which is aimed at a multiscale (from local to planetary) understanding of environmental changes that transcend national boundaries. Over the past decade, global-change research has made significant efforts to be more inclusive of science communities from China, Russia, Africa, and the Global South.",

These universal agreements reflect a global consensus to address climate change and strive for sustainable and balanced social and economic development that promotes the well-being of socio-ecological systems. They also provide a powerful statement of intended direction for humanity, as captured in the UN's 17 SDGs. They create an imperative for transformative change in response to global challenges. However, such changes have not been forthcoming at the rate and scale required by global agreements. As a consequence, we continue to see increasing concentrations of CO 2 in the atmosphere, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and growing inequalities among people and nations. 9, 10 The Great Acceleration is generated and sustained by powerful economic mechanisms, including globalization, marketization, and financialization, which are based on the mainstream model of doing business and promoting economic growth. 11 To foster growth and maximize profit, companies and other organizations aggressively appropriate value as much as possible from nature and society and externalize the costs to natural ecosystems and to human communities, including future generations. 12, 13 The mainstream business model drives competition and consumption and guarantees that human and social activities continue to drive the overuse of ecosystems beyond their carrying capacity toward breaching several planetary boundaries. 1 The current economic paradigm has led us to the point where the functioning of our global life-support system is no longer assured. 14 The global economy and functioning Earth system are on a collision course that will ultimately have dire consequences for humans and the biosphere; we need an urgent course correction, and current research paradigms are not meeting this challenge.",

Our modest goal here is to lay out the special research challenges posed by the emerging Anthropocene era and exhort sustainability science to address these challenges impactfully. We focus our suggestions primarily on research policy measures that shape the conduct of science and agency of scientists and only secondarily on institutional policy measures. This is not intended to be a broad public-policy discussion on sustainability research. Sustainability science needs deep integration of the social sciences, humanities, and the arts with its dominant natural sciences. The focus should be on complex problems of nature, culture, institutions, and human behavior and the co-creation of knowledge with stakeholders. To do this, sustainability science and its stakeholders will need to better understand the funding dynamics and higher levels of research funding. To make sustainability science impactful, we need to modify the current research ecosystems. Sustainability science must engage with society (economic, social, and cultural spheres) to extend many successful small-scale seeds for change. The goal of sustainability science is to create a sustainable Earth by creatively deploying all available knowledge of humanity.",

The human capacity to respond to these changes has not kept pace. Some of the historical drivers of social change, such as generational turnover, have slowed as a result of increasing longevity. Consequently, cultural and value changes that influence how humans relate to the environment have to occur within a generation rather than over generations. Researchers themselves are challenged to think differently and engage in interand transdisciplinary research processes. However, it takes time to develop common understanding between disciplines and engage across different stakeholder knowledge epistemologies; therefore, integrative research risks lagging behind the changes it is addressing (Table 1) . Spatial Connectivity Sustainability policies and practices must be local and context specific, yet they are embedded in larger systems that are increasingly and more rapidly connected. Although developments in inter-and transdisciplinary research over the past few decades have delivered much success at local levels in agriculture, development, and other domains, replicating this success across scales and globally is genuinely challenging. Transformations of social, economic, and institutional systems must also be negotiated across scales. Sustainability science research has not reconciled the gap between global-scale problems and locally based solutions. We still do not know how to scale up solutions in an interconnected world (Table 1) .",

However, in today's globalized system, many social norms have been shaped by market-based capitalism and consumption, and the rates and distributed extent of change mean that managing the dynamics of winners and losers is increasingly challenging. For example, oil profits in one part of the world could finance investments that undermine sustainability interventions in another. At a time when there is a need to build engagement across all levels of society, identifying and transforming the nature of power relationships can be difficult. Sustainability science has not fully acknowledged or integrated global power dynamics into understandings of change (Table 1) . Selective Embeddedness of Science in Society Science is extremely specialized and operates within universities and corporations, increasingly fulfilling the mandates of government and corporate funders. Science does not reach wide swathes of global society, particularly the communities where challenges of the Anthropocene are concentrated. Many sectors, especially the informal sector of the economy, are not benefiting from scientific knowledge. The informal sector accounts for up to 20% of global output in developed countries and over 33% in developing countries. 15 According to the International Labor Organization, two billion women and men make their living in the informal economy, which provides over 50% of non-agricultural employment in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. 16 In Africa, the informal economy could account for 50%-80% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 90% of new jobs. 17 Even in sectors where science does influence economic and social decisions, it does not always effectively serve broad public interests. Science funding for the public good and commons protection is insufficient to address the massive and expanding problems of the Anthropocene (Table 1) .",

Yet, the current approach to sustainability science still pays insufficient attention to the social and human dimensions, and holistic integrated research remains the exception rather than the norm. Sustainability science is still dominated by the natural sciences, and there is grossly less investment in the social sciences, the humanities, and arts than in the ''hard sciences,'' as well as a general underinvestment in research overall. The uptake of research insights from the social sciences and the arts and humanities has been limited to the findings that fit within the existing paradigm. 18 Particularly debilitating is the failure to open up to new perspectives and different types of knowledge in the name of keeping science ''objective'' and apolitical. Even where efforts have been made to integrate social, human, and natural sciences in transdisciplinary research, these successes are challenged by scale. In a recent review, Norstr\u00f6 m et al. 19 identified four key principles for good transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge: the engagement by research should be context based, pluralistic, goal oriented, and interactive. These principles, which draw on a great body of understanding from past transdisciplinary successes, are all challenged by the attributes of the Anthropocene. Engagement must be context specific, yet it seems to be required at all levels, including globally. It must be pluralistic, yet the diversity of stakeholders even at the local level is immense, and more so for global processes. Goal-oriented science is challenging with diverse actors across scales, and making engagement interactive, with feedback loops that promote reflection and learning, requires new thinking at the global level.",

In fact, alternative paradigms are usually dismissed rather than encouraged within research systems. Although global assessment initiatives such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recognize and include cultural beliefs, values, worldviews, and indigenous and local knowledge, 22 many perspectives from the social sciences and humanities have not been taken seriously in sustainability science. For example, research within feminist political ecology, decolonization studies, and ''new materialism'' offers new thinking on ethical and political challenges. 23, 24 To capture the breadth and depth of global challenges, sustainability science needs to support efforts to recognize multiple perspectives and ways of knowing. 25 This includes developing profoundly holistic views on how natural and cultural systems coevolve. 26 Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research activities in academic institutions are seeking such integration. There have been numerous attempts to encourage transdisciplinary collaboration and team science. 27 In higher-income countries, there is a tradition of collaborative cross-sectoral research, such as the agricultural extension research in the US and that conducted by the Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) in Australia. Recently, the US National Science Foundation has encouraged research collaborations across science fields, which it calls ''convergence science,'' by awarding grants for themes such as ''navigating the new Arctic.'' Global programs such as Future Earth are developing ''knowledge-action networks'' to promote transdisciplinary research. However, the societal ecosystems in which such initiatives operate do not embrace their logic or provide resources to scale them globally as necessary. Current efforts to support integrated and transdisciplinary research do not match the scale of the problem.",

It has had limited success in connecting with key stakeholders (policymakers, corporate decision makers, political leaders, and civil society) through a language that they understand. It has also failed to convey not only the sense of urgency underscored by global changes but also the possibilities for responding.

Many examples of existing research can contribute to a more integrative discourse within sustainability science. However, it is important to consider these different perspectives together rather than as separate boxes or silos. Drawing on an integral framework, 28 Figure 2 depicts how sustainability science has been largely confined to the domain of ''systems'' science and how less attention has been paid to behavior, culture, and experience. An integral approach to sustainability science includes a more balanced representation of these other three perspectives. Below, we highlight some specific examples of research in these other ''quadrants'' to illustrate the potential to broaden the systems-oriented perspective of sustainability science and deepen our understanding of how to respond to environmental change. Behavioral Change There is still a tendency within sustainability science to draw on the information-deficit model and assume that once individuals ll OPEN ACCESS and organizations realize the risks associated with environmental change, they will take action or at least can be manipulated or nudged in that direction. 29 Yet, plenty of research in psychology-including research on the relationship between the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of human actors, i.e., between motivation that is inherent in the task itself and motivation that relies on external rewards or sanctions 30 -shows that human behavior is more complex than this. The latter can result in the crowding-out effect, where external rewards actually reduce the intrinsic motivation of the actors. A crucial result of this mechanism is that people's environmental commitment declines and more environmentally harmful behavior emerges. 31, 32 A key message here is that intrinsic motivation is critical to sustainable behavior within rapidly changing systems.",

Art is ubiquitous in all human communities globally over most of history.

Acknowledging both differences and developments in perspective-taking capacities and meaning making can provide insights into why people relate to sustainability issues differently and how to connect with a diversity of worldviews. For example, in a study of meaning making among farmers in El Salvador as it related to climate-change adaptation, Hochachka 44 found differences in the object of awareness, the number of perspectives taken, the complexity of thought, and the scope of time considered in one's understanding of climate change and adaptation.

Education for global-change problems needs to be more holistic and contextually anchored through the incorporation of systems and their interconnectedness with culture and experience. Education that embraces an integrative discourse recognizes multiple perspectives and the need for critical thinking, reflection, and experience-based learning that leads to action and a sense of agency. 45 One way of integrating different perspectives is through ''action research,'' which focuses on driving change and doing rather than just reaching understanding. 46 Otto Scharmer and colleagues at the Presencing Institute created an actionresearch platform at the intersection of science, consciousness, and social change. 47 Their ''Theory U'' framework and methodology for leading profound innovation proposes that the quality of the results that people create is a function of the quality of awareness, or consciousness, from which the participants in the system operate. The inner shift, from fighting the old to sensing and presencing an emerging future, is at the core of deep leadership work. 48 People are encouraged to expand their thinking from the head to the heart. It is a shift from an ego-system awareness to an eco-system awareness that cares about the well-being of all, including oneself.

The CRCs in Australia have been a generally successful approach to making public funding contingent on a close working relationship between researchers and stakeholders, the latter of which provide funding input, in a vast array of different topics (https://www. business.gov.au/Grants-and-Programs/Cooperative-Research-Centres-CRC-Grants). CRC structures increasingly require a formal, even dominant, role for stakeholders in governance; even so, the growing experience suggests that it takes up to 5 years for the diverse partners to really work out a common mission and deliver on the promise of transdisciplinarity to get novel research into action. Another promising approach is through greater investment in coordinated, applied, local innovation hubs or sustainable development labs. At community colleges and universities in the US, ''living labs'' are using university operational facilities to create engaged action learning opportunities for students and engaged scholarship opportunities for researchers. 49 Examples of integrated and holistic knowledge-creation and action initiatives that embrace more diverse epistemologies are also emerging from social and cultural institutions, as exemplified by the encyclical letter Laudato si' by Pope Francis. 50 The encyclical presents an integral ecology that underscores the human origins of the ecological crisis and proposes fundamental changes in organizing economic life. Among the important suggestions put forward by the Pope is increased frugality in consumption, and he also acknowledges the intrinsic value of nature. To realize his vision, Pope Francis initiated the Economy of Francesco project. 51 This international cooperative platform brings together 5,000 young economists, entrepreneurs, and change makers to co-create and put in place a new economic model in the spirit of integral human development.",

The challenge of evolving sustainability science cannot be just endogenous and isolated. Science is an instrument of society, and it operates within a broader socio-economic, cultural, and technological milieu that sets the operating context for research. At present, the external context is characterized by neoliberal capitalism that sets up competition rather than collaboration; devalues or overlooks social, human, and environmental capitals; fails to see systemic effects; and encourages inequality. 52 Science needs to rethink its social relevance and social connections to effectively contribute to the grand challenges of the Anthropocene. It must play an active role in the concurrent co-evolution of economies and their underlying cultural assumptions in sustainable directions. Within that broader context, scientific institutions and business organizations supporting science would need transformation of their core purpose, administrative processes, and reward systems. Sciences would need deep unification across epistemic and disciplinary lines and be willing to play a more active, participatory role in the transformations required for global sustainability in the world at large.",

They outline four strategies that can contribute to transformation: doing change, forcing change, directing change, and co-creating change. According to these authors, most transformations involve a mix of all four types, and research can play a different role in each of these strategies. There is research to be done on actual transformations, as well as on transformation processes, practices, and pathways. Although systems thinking emphasizes that addressing design and intent are the strongest leverage points, 20 these ll OPEN ACCESS are also the hardest to achieve, particularly when the personal sphere of transformation is considered to be ''external'' or irrelevant to systems change. 43 An integration of experience, culture, behavior, and systems within sustainability science recognizes that the system is not ''out there,'' and it highlights the importance of ''being change,'' i.e., embodying the changes that are considered necessary at all levels, right here and now, and critical to the process of creating an equitable and sustainable future. 54 Recognizing that people engage with the future differently is also essential for activating transformations to sustainability. The Three Horizons framework helps to generate agency and future consciousness by recognizing different ways of addressing uncertainty. This approach distinguishes between incremental and transformative change and emphasizes the need for participatory, reflective, and action-based research. 58 Research on how to pre-condition the system for transformation through incremental changes also provides valuable insights on how to create transformative change 56,57 by drawing, for example, on parts of the Australian wine industry that were adapting incrementally as opposed to transformationally. 57 When change is seen as a process, incremental changes offer an opportunity to shape the pathways for transformative change, as depicted on the righthand side of Figure 3 , and thereby activate easier systems interventions (left side) in order to pre-condition the system for more transformative change in the harder systems characteristics of structure and intent. In practice, this requires a diversity of the intervention strategies (top of cone), as can be seen in examples such as the German energy transition or marriage equality in the US. 55 Then arises the question, how can similar insights be applied to sustainability science itself?

This means that researchers have to reflect on how science should evolve from the research that is already available on transformations to research that can activate sustainability transformations in the wider world. We note four lessons in this regard, examine incremental changes in research organizations (where a great deal of science is operationalized), and then share some thoughts on how science can drive transformation across society. First, most environmental problems, especially the global ones, are complex, messy, and wicked. Too often the problem formulation by researchers is partial and inadequate because they reduce the real-world, multifaceted problems into a single scientific-technical dimension and seek to solve this. Instead of providing a precise answer to the wrong question (i.e., committing an ''error of the third kind''), approaches should address the full scope of the problem in question (the scientific-technical, the interpersonal-social, the systemic-ecological, and the existential-spiritual) and then develop some satisficing balance among them. 59 The job of sustainability science is to identify problems and then to produce response options that are substantively adequate and ethically acceptable in broad socio-economic contexts. The same logic can be applied to thinking reflexively about sustainability science itself.",

Research institutions, especially universities, are being challenged to produce impactful research. It is widely held that good transdisciplinarity (convergence science) is a means to greater and more enduring impact, especially in more complex and value-laden problems, such as many of the sustainability challenges discussed here. Such transdisciplinary challenges almost inevitably end up also requiring interdisciplinary approaches. 66, 67 The incremental moves noted above from universities and funders toward promoting more inter-and transdisciplinarity must now be accelerated and empowered in both intent and design.",

This could require additional resources to speed up these social processes. Many current funding mechanisms and processes do not recognize the need for these additional resources to be effective. However, we must also work harder to recognize where transdisciplinarity is really needed and where it is not.

Inter-and transdisciplinarity need to be supported by a much greater investment in social science and the humanities if we are to promote an equal partnership across the disciplines. As noted earlier, this investment is miniscule in comparison with that in the natural sciences, even if these also are under-resourced. Even if we don't wait for more deep interdisciplinarity, many research areas require greater attention: understanding the deeply social nature of desire and consumption as it expands globally, mapping power dynamics across world consumer demand, exploring how culture change can support global transformations, rethinking the idea of ''progress'' in Western cultures, and understanding global social and cultural tipping points and other aspects of mobilizing leverage points for systems change. 8, 70 In addition to this improved investment, there should be a significant effort to improve holistic conceptual models and research practices that draw on multiple traditions. There is potential for increasing resources via government university and private-sector partnering. 71, 72 These could help to resolve epistemological conflicts among the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and arts. This is important both interdisciplinarily (e.g., through conceptual models that deeply support the indivisibility and universality of sustainable development as framed by the SDGs) and also transdisciplinarily (e.g., through extended engagement and experimentation with traditional knowledge systems and faith-based systems).",

Ethically, these should be in areas where the direction is both normatively justified by the framing of goals such as the SDGs and factually justified by research and analysis. Examples already noted include dramatic changes to our economic system away from narrow valuation of GDP to broader human well-being, the removal of structural barriers related to the skewed distribution of wealth and consequent inequalities, and a fundamental rejection of simplistic marketbased capitalism, all of which are underpinned by a deep realignment of values to a more collaborative, reflexive, and kinder view of humanity's stewardship of our planetary home. 52 Needless to say, such changes would require supporting changes in all areas of institutional and governance design, but these are, of course, past human inventions themselves. The role of sustainability science (and scientists) here would be as activists, as envisaged in Waddell et al.'s ''forcing change'' quadrant. 53 Third, in addition to playing this activist role, sustainability science needs to have a greater voice in societal processes, such as international UN governance discussions or discourse with global religions and traditional societies. The past attitude of scientists has tended to emphasize an autocratic expert identity. The transformed role must be as a partner among equals in seeking the normatively defined outcomes. Global-change research has sought this collaborative role, for example, at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) and through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and IPBES assessment processes, but in the SDG development process it was still relegated to being one among many lobby groups. The UN Secretary General's Science Advisory Panel is still seen as a set of experts on the outside of the political process, as are most government scientific advisory boards. This is a failing on both sides of the relationship, and it must be worked on without hubris in policy and other domains.",

Research programs launched in the 1980s and 1990s supported the development of the Paris Agreement and SDGs in 2015, which further fostered the establishment of the International Science Council in 2018 and the world's first-ever transdisciplinary congress in sustainability in 2020. ll OPEN ACCESS challenges to research systems and their ability to analyze and contribute to global transformation.",
