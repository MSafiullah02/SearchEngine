In the autoinhibited form, the two N-terminal CARD domains of RIG-I form a head to tail interaction, where the N-terminus of the CARD2 head interacts directly with the C-terminal region of CARD1 and also interact with Heli domain [17\u2022\u2022]. These CARD-helicase interactions may also prevent access to MAVS directly or by blocking ubiquitination by TRIM25 [18] and interactions with unanchored polyubiquitin chains [19], which are important for persistent downstream signaling.",

The CTD, which can directly bind to dsRNA [20\u2022, 21\u2022] and the ATPase core are both required for dsRNA recognition and signaling [22\u2022\u2022, 23\u2022\u2022]. In addition, the pincer motif (also called the bridging domain or regulatory element) is critical for RIG-I activation as its interactions with the ATPase core functions as an allosteric coupler that facilitates RNA recognition and signaling [24\u2022\u2022]. Consistent with these findings that multiple domains within the RLR architecture is important for signaling, the helicase domain alone binds dsRNA with low affinity, and the addition of the CTD markedly improves dsRNA binding [25\u2022\u2022, 26\u2022\u2022].",

            "text": "Many characteristics of RNA are important for RLR activation. Double strandedness [7\u2022, 27, 28, 29] as well as the \u2018blunt\u2019 ends of dsRNA are important elements of RNA recognition by RLRs and are required to activate RLRs [5, 30]. However, selection of self RNA from non-self RNA and therefore persistent signaling require additional characteristics. These include 5\u2032 triphosphate (5\u2032ppp) [21\u2022, 31, 32, 33], 5\u2032 diphosphate (5\u2032 pp) [34\u2022, 35\u2022], and the panhandle structure formed by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) [35\u2022, 36]. Yoneyama et al. [7\u2022] suggested that dsRNA binding and ATPase activity are both required for RLR signaling and this proposal was recently demonstrated in two independent studies, where ATP binding, but not ATP hydrolysis was shown to be important for signaling [22\u2022\u2022, 26\u2022\u2022, 37, 38]. Based on these studies a model emerges where critical interactions of dsRNA with the CTD and subsequently with the helicase result in the reorientation of the pincer domain leading to ATP hydrolysis and release of the N-terminal CARDs for signal transduction. Recent reports also point to ATP hydrolysis as a potential mechanism to discriminate among some RNA lacking PAMP-like characteristics where signaling is aborted. If PAMP characteristics in the bound RNA is observed, then RLRs can engage in more sustained signaling, potentially leading to higher burst activity and limited viral infections. RIG-I and MDA-5 can bind short and long dsRNA, with shorter dsRNA acting as better activators for RIG-I [22\u2022\u2022, 39] and longer RNA are better activators of MDA-5 [9, 40, 41\u2022, 42\u2022]. Additional studies point to the stability of the dsRNA stem region suggesting stable double stranded RNA is necessary for persistent signaling during viral infections [43, 44], but not sufficient as a dumbbell RNA lacking blunt ends can bind RIG-I yet display attenuated signaling [22\u2022\u2022]. A recent study used mass spectrometry to assess how RIG-I domains change conformation upon RNA ligand and ATP binding [45\u2022\u2022]. This study, which used RNA ligands from the Rawling et al. study [22\u2022\u2022], revealed that differences in hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) patterns were consistent with major conformational changes upon RNA and ATP binding, as well as with end recognition and binding to double stranded stem regions. These studies collectively show that multiple interactions within the RLRs and multiple properties of RNA are important to confer specificity in order to discriminate between self vs non-self RNA.",

While data is limited in terms of sequence and structural compositions of these RNAs, emerging studies point to the 5\u2032 cap structure as a major element that hosts use to discriminate between self vs non-self patterns. The eukaryotic cap structure contains a triphosphorylated linked 5\u2032-5\u2032 with a N7 methylated guanosine (Figure 1b). Methylation status of this structure, including N7 and 2\u2032O positions result in various permutations of the cap, cap0, cap1, and cap2 designations (see Figure 1b). While the potential role of the cap structure in RLR recognition has been previous speculated, the first evidence of the specificity of recognition was recently defined by Schuberth-Wagner et al., where the significance of the synthetic modified 5\u2032ppp-RNA and its influence on innate immune signaling were assessed. These studies revealed that various 5\u2032 modifications can drive specificity of binding to RIG-I [46\u2022\u2022]. For example, the cap (no methylations) like 5\u2032ppp is a strong activator of IFN signaling whereas cap0 is able to partially stimulate IFNs, consistent with its lower than 5\u2032ppp binding affinity for RIG-I [46\u2022\u2022]. Previous studies of RIG-I bound to dsRNA that included either 5\u2032ppp or 5\u2032pp suggested that the binding pocket may be able to accommodate the cap structure [21\u2022, 33], but studies with cap0 revealed lower binding than that observed for 5\u2032ppp. Additional modifications at the 2\u2032O position of +1 or +2 nucleotides in the presence or absence of N7 methylation resulted in suboptimal or completely abolished signaling. Of note, the ability of RIG-I to bind RNA is consistent with IFN signaling in cell-based studies [22\u2022\u2022, 23\u2022\u2022, 34\u2022, 38]; however, there are some deviations that suggest the potential for additional layers of regulation.",

In comparison to the structures of 5\u2032 OH and 5\u2032 PPP bound to RIG-I, the G nucleotide base is located within the binding site of the cap0 bound to RIG-I structure but pointing away from the basic patch within RIG-I CTD. The disordering of motif IVa accommodates the positioning and prevents additional steric hindrance [26\u2022\u2022]. This orientation, which was previously predicted, is the most favorable since addition of the m7G moiety may also provide electrostatic repulsion with respect to the basic charge within the binding pockets. Thus, a combination of steric and electrostatic forces are likely controlling the interactions within the binding pocket.",

In West Nile virus (WNV) [64\u2022\u2022] or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [46\u2022\u2022, 65\u2022\u2022], viruses generated with mutations within the methyltransferase domain results in IFIT sensitivity, where the mutant viruses, but not wildtype viruses were subjected to restriction by Ifit1. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a picornavirus, which uses a 5\u2032 viral peptide to evade detection, while members of the Togaviridae family uses a highly stable 5\u2032 RNA secondary structure [66\u2022] (Figure 4b). In each situation, the absence of the 2\u2032O methylation is compensated in order to avoid detection by IFIT. High resolution structural information for each of these systems will likely provide additional insights into the specific molecular mechanisms that underlie these immune evasion mechanisms.",

Additionally, the 5\u2032 cap structure of RNA is thought synergistically enhance protein translation. Recent studies indicate that in addition to facilitating protein translation, the 5\u2032 cap structures promote self vs non-self-discrimination. Given the ability to detect and respond to viral infections due to the immune responses triggered by 5\u2032 RNA recognition, it is not surprising that viruses have developed mechanisms to antagonize proteins that detect cap structures. We have seen remarkable progress in our understanding of host recognition of viral RNA. Future work to address how RNA cap recognition leads to sustained downstream immune signaling will enhance our understanding of this rapidly developing area at a key host-pathogen interface. Such studies are also expected to provide new opportunities to develop therapeutics by targeting cap-dependent signaling.",
