We have recently shown that infection with human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6) is associated with reduced allergic sensitization in 18month-old children [3] . We have confirmed this in an experimental animal model of allergic asthma, where mice that are exposed to HHV-6 are protected against allergic inflammation. Mice exposed to HHV-6 have significantly lower levels of allergen-specific IgE, eosinophils and Th2 cytokines as compared to allergic control mice [4] . In addition, previous infection with EBV [5, 6] and Hepatitis A virus [7, 8] has been associated with a reduced incidence of allergic sensitization and allergic symptoms in human subjects. Infection with orofecal and foodborne bacteria, including Toxoplasma gondii and Helicobacter pylori, or exposure to bacterial components, such as endotoxin, have also been demonstrated to be inversely related to atopic allergy [8] [9] [10] [11] . Furthermore, the composition of the intestinal commensal flora has been suggested to affect the risk of developing allergic disease, where early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is associated with a lower prevalence of allergy in young children (0-2 years of age) [12] [13] [14] .",

The initiation of the T cell response and the subsequent maturation of the Infections that occur early in life may have a beneficial effect on the immune system and thereby reduce the risk of allergen sensitization and \u2044 or allergic disease. It is not yet clear to what extent specific virus and \u2044 or bacteria can mediate this effect. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of virus and bacteria in CD4 + T cell-derived cytokine production in newborns. We compared the effects of five bacteria (Staphlococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidus) and seven virus (adenovirus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, morbillivirus and poliovirus) on the Th1 \u2044 Th2 cytokine production in mixed lymphocyte reactions using CD4 + T cells from cord blood cocultured with allogenic myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells. When comparing the baseline cytokine production prior to microbial stimulation, we observed that cord plasmacytoid DC were stronger inducers of Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) compared with cord myeloid DC and to adult DC. When adding microbes to these cultures, bacteria and virus differed in two major respects; Firstly, all enveloped viruses, but none of the bacteria, blocked Th2 (IL-13) production by cord CD4 + cells. Secondly, all Gram-positive bacteria, but none of the virus, induced IL-12p40 responses, but the IL-12p40 responses did not affect Th1 cytokine production (IFN-c). Instead, Th1 responses were correlated with the capacity to induce IFN-a secretion, which in cord cells were induced by S. aureus and influenza virus alone. These data imply that enveloped virus can deviate Th2 responses in human cord T cells.",

This is largely due to a poor DC function in the newborns [20] , which is accompanied with a reduced capacity to produce the Th1-polarizing cytokines IL-12 [21, 22] , IFN-a [21, 23] and IFN-c [24] . Even though pDC from cord blood have impaired IFN-a \u2044 b production after TLR activation [23] , cord pDC may secrete large amounts of IFN-a after viral exposure. We have recently shown that cord pDC exposed to HHV-6 produce large amounts of IFN-a. This was correlated with a reduced capacity to induce IL-5 and IL-13 in responding T cells, which instead produced elevated levels of IFN-c [3] . Thus, repeated microbial stimuli of the innate immune system of neonates may accelerate the maturation process and enhance Th1 cell development. The amplified Th1 responses might then lead to reduced Th2 polarization and a reduced risk of developing allergic diseases, in line with the hygiene hypothesis [25] . In addition, the immune system of newborns is also characterized by less mature regulatory T cells [26] that have a reduced suppressive capacity [27] . Still, regulatory T cells of the neonatal immune system are functional and able to exert suppressive functions [28, 29] , yet to a lesser extent than those in adults [27] .",

For this purpose, five different bacteria and seven different viruses were used. Bacteria were chosen based on (i) being Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria and (ii) being part of the commensal intestinal flora and \u2044 or being the cause of infection in humans [30] . The viruses were chosen based on (i) being dsDNA, rsRNA or ssRNA viruses, (ii) being enveloped or non-enveloped and (iii) causing either acute or chronic infection in humans. To study the effect of these microbes, we measured cytokine secretion in cord blood-derived T cells that were cultured with allogenic pDC or mDC. We found that all enveloped virus tested, but none of the bacteria, could block IL-13 production in cord blood CD4 + T cells. This effect was not associated with enhanced Th1 responses. Our data suggest an important role for enveloped viruses in the early maturation of the immune system.",

As cord T cells have not yet met a specific antigen, it is not possible to measure recall T cell responses in these cells. Instead, we assessed the cytokine profiles in cord T cells in response to allogenic DC, that is in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). We, therefore, incubated purified cord blood CD4 + T cells with allogenic cord mDC or cord pDC and analysed the cytokine profile after 48 h of coculture. Similarly, adult CD4 + T cells were incubated with allogenic adult mDC or adult pDC, and the cytokine profile was assessed after 48 h of coculture. The cytokines analysed were the Th1-specific cytokines IL-2 and IFN-c and the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. We found that pDC from cord blood induced significantly higher levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 in responding CD4 + T cells compared with both pDC and mDC from adult blood and to mDC from cord blood (Fig. 2C,D) . Cord pDC induced 8.5-fold higher levels of IL-13 and 19-fold higher levels of IL-5 compared with adult pDC, and five-fold and 13-fold higher levels of these cytokines compared with cord mDC. We could not detect any differences in Th2 cytokine production when comparing mDC from cord and adult blood (Fig. 2C,D) . Furthermore, cord pDC also induced higher levels of the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-c compared with adult pDC and compared to mDC from both adult and cord blood ( Fig. 2A,B) .

However, individual Th1 \u2044 Th2 balance in newborns varies depending on parental and environmental factors [40] . In this paper, we show that the baseline production of the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 were elevated in cord CD4 + T cells compared with adult T cells. The Th2 cytokine induction observed in cord cells was not an intrinsic function of the neonatal T cells, but rather a Th2-inducing effect of cord pDC. This is in line with previous findings where pDC was shown to promote Th2 responses in healthy and allergic subjects [15, 19] . This is, to our knowledge, the first study to show that the levels of Th2 cytokines obtained in vitro activated T cells differs between newborns and adults. We could not detect any significant differences in Th1 cytokine synthesis (IFN-c and IL-2) between T cells from adults and newborns, even though others have shown that cord blood DC is impaired in their capacity to induce both IFN-c and IL-2 in responding T cells [39] . Instead, our data imply that cord pDC were superior to both cord mDC and adult DC in promoting Th2 responses.",

We found that enveloped viruses (i.e. HSV-1, coronavirus, CMV, morbillivirus and influenza virus) blocked IL-13 secretion, while bacteria and nonenveloped viruses did not. This confirms previous findings from us and others, showing that the Th2 skewing effect of pDC in newborns and adults can be omitted by microbial stimuli [3, 19] . However, the diminished IL-13 production that was seen in virus stimulated cultures could not be correlated with Th1 polarization, that is IFN-a, IFN-c, IL-2 or IL-12 secretion. None of the viruses tested could induce IL-12 secretion, and influenza was the only inactivated virus to evoke IFN-a, IFNc and IL-2 production. Still, these findings emphasize the importance of early life microbial stimuli of the innate immune system for an accurate maturation of the immune system, that is to avoid unwanted Th2 responses.

However, IL-12 secretion could not be correlated with the induction of Th1 cytokine secretion, as S. aureus was the only microbe to induce both IL-12 and Th1 cytokine secretion. As we only measured IL-12 p40 and not the biologically active IL-12 p70, we cannot deduce from this study whether any of the tested bacteria did indeed induce IL-12 p70. However, Gram-positive bacteria are known for their capacity to induce IL-12 p70 in both adults and newborns [41, 42] .

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that the cytokine pattern in newborns is associated with the propensity to develop allergic disease. Studies suggest that children that develop allergies later in life and \u2044 or with a family history of allergy are Th2 skewed at birth, even though conflicting data exists [38, [51] [52] [53] [54] . Elevated levels of IL-13 [55] [56] [57] and decreased levels of IFN-c [51, 58, 59] in cord T cells has been shown to be risk factors for developing allergic disease later in life, even though the role of IFN-c is less clear-cut [55] . In this paper, we show that cord pDC drive the neonatal T cell response towards a Th2 bias and that viral stimuli can omit this Th2 skewed effect. This is in line with our previous findings where HHV-6 activated pDC block Th2 cytokine synthesis in responding cord T cells [3] . This fits well with our and others observations, showing that childhood infection with HHV-6 or EBV is inversely related to allergic sensitization and \u2044 or allergic symptoms [3, 5, 6] . Furthermore, the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the increase in allergic diseases during the last decades is caused by a decreased infectious burden [2] , which in turn is owing to vaccination, antibiotics, improved hygiene and generally enhanced socioeconomic standard [1] . Given that many childhood viral diseases have a reduced incidence [1, [60] [61] [62] , it is tempting to speculate that the large increase in allergic diseases could be related to a decreased exposure to viral infections. Taken into account that our studies were performed in vitro using inactivated microbes, we suggest that viral infections during infancy may play an important role in the development of the immune system, by driving the adaptive immunity away from Th2 biased immune responses, and thus, to prohibit the development of allergic diseases.",
