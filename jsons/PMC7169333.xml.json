On this examination the OD was exophthalmic, deviated dorso\u2010laterally, and exhibited pronounced resistance to retropulsion. The motility of the globe was impaired in all directions and resisted forced duction testing. The conjunctiva of this eye was moderately hyperemic, and the third eyelid was prominent, hyperemic and slightly thickened. The right cornea also had an exposure keratitis characterized by extensive corneal edema and a 1\u2010cm diameter, deeply vascularized, central corneal ulcer which extended to one\u2010half of the normal corneal thickness (Fig. 3). The OD did not exhibit a menace response and the corneal opacity prevented determination of whether a direct pupillary light reflex was present in this eye. Stimulation of the OD with a bright light source failed to elicit a consensual pupillary light reflex in the OS. The OS retained vision and had unremarkable ocular structures, motility, and reflexes, except for a moderate resistance to the globe retropulsion that was greater than the normal expected resistance to retropulsion in a brachycephalic cat. Intraocular pressure, measured by applanation tonometry, was 14 and 20 mmHg in OD and OS, respectively.",

The MRI confirmed the alterations seen by CT and, after the administration of contrast medium, it also showed an enhancement of the right portion of the optic chiasm (Fig. 6) that could not be appreciated on review of the CT scan acquired a few days earlier.

Epistaxis was also present in several cats. In three of the 10 cats a lymphocytic\u2013plasmacytic rhinitis was present, but fungal hyphae were found only in one or both frontal sinuses and not in the nasal passages. Rhinoscopy in eight of the cases demonstrated white masses in the nasal cavities and/or sinuses, whereas CT (performed in seven cats) showed destruction of the turbinate bones. Two cats with sino\u2010nasal disease also had involvement of the orbit. In one case this was associated with fungal sinusitis,\n5\n and in the other it was associated with fungal sinusitis and rhinitis.\n4\n The literature also contains another case of orbital aspergillosis in a cat in which there were no reported signs of fungal rhinitis nor sinusitis.\n1\n Therefore, although fungal orbital disease can be an extension of a fungal sino\u2010nasal infection as in the case reported here, this does not appear to always be the case.",

Additionally, it is possible that Persian and Himalayan cats may have a specific breed predisposition to systemic infection with Aspergillus spp. much as is seen in young adult female German Shepherds,\n27\n although no sex predisposition has been reported for cats.",

Although A. fumigatus can be both a primary and an opportunistic pathogen (as well as a major allergen in humans),\n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n extensive investigations of its genome suggest that it is able to create disease not because it possesses true virulence genes, but instead because it has distinct sets of temperature\u2010dependent genes that allow it to survive in environments that are either thermally (e.g. at body temperature) or oxidatively stressful.\n28\n, \n29\n, \n32\n, \n33\n In dogs, Aspergillus fungal endotoxins that are hemolytic and dermonecrotoxic\n34\n, \n35\n have also been associated with a vasculitis and vascular necrosis of the submucosal vessels that leads to destruction and necrosis of the nasal mucosa and underlying turbinate bones.\n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n Based on the few reports in the literature and the case reported here, cats may also experience a similar phenomenon.",

It is tempting to speculate that the lower frequency of sino\u2010aspergillosis in nonbrachycephalic cats is attributable to an initially more open nasal passageway that is more difficult to obstruct. Proliferation of mucus secreting glands in the nasal mucosa in response to chronic inflammation also may result in more mucoid nasal secretions and reduced mucociliary clearance of organisms from the nasal passages.\n15\n In concert, these events may create an ideal microenvironment for proliferation of bacteria and/or fungi, with resultant increased susceptibility to secondary infections.\n15\n, \n16\n\n",

Additionally, multiple biopsies of the nasal passages acquired at the first rhinoscopic examination failed to reveal fungal elements and did not demonstrate a granulomatous component to the inflammatory process at that time. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the initial samples obtained by pinch biopsy were not truly representative of the disease process at that time, as pinch biopsies could conceivably have been too superficial.",

The initial absence of fungi on multiple biopsy specimens, the relatively prolonged positive response to immunomodulating/immunosuppressive (doxycycline and glucocorticoids) agents, and the shift towards a granulomatous inflammatory component on the second set of biopsies in this case, however, partially substantiate the hypothesis that in this cat the LPR occurred first.",
