The operation will be consultant led and surgical team kept lean in order to minimize exposure of the virus to others. Most operations can be performed in full PPE and N95 masks, but our experience suggests that PAPR may be more ideal for prolonged surgery beyond 3 hours as it is more comfortable for the surgeon resulting in less fatigue. We have also found that it is rather cumbersome to wear surgical magnifying loupes when operating with Tier 2 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or PAPR and vascular surgeons should be aware of this when operating on COVID-19 suspect or positive patients. If the surgery is non-urgent and can be delayed for between 24 to 48 hours, then we will perform two SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests 24 hours apart and take direction from our infectious disease physicians about the feasibility of de-isolating the patient if both swabs are negative.",

The left lower limb was unsalvageable with mottling and fixed staining up to the groin crease. At the time of surgery, his COVID-19 status was inconclusive and hence surgery was performed in Full Tier 2 PPE. Right femoral embolectomy was performed and a Valiant Navion low profile thoracic stent-graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, California) was chosen as his iliac artery diameter measured only 5 to 6 mm. This was deployed just distal to the left subclavian artery to jail the clot in to prevent further embolic events. A left hip disarticulation was then performed as there was ischaemic muscle in the left upper thigh, which would be unsuitable for an above knee amputation. He was eventually found to be COVID-19 negative and de-isolated. He is currently undergoing intensive rehabilitation.",
