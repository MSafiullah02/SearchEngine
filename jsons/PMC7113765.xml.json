            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are spherical and enveloped viruses with large, unsegmented, single positive RNA genomes that are 26.2\u201331.7 kb in length. The two-thirds of the genome at the 5\u2032 end are translated into two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are later cleaved by 3CLpro and PLpro to yield nonstructural proteins (nsps). The remaining one-third of the genome is responsible for coding the structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope protein (E), integral membrane protein (M), and genome-associated nucleocapsid protein (N). Some CoVs also contain a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) (van Boheemen et al., 2012). Interspersed between these genes in the coronavirus genome are several genes coding for accessory proteins. Although dispensable for virus growth in vitro, as determined using reverse genetics and targeted mutagenesis analyses, most of them are involved in regulating the host immune system (Narayanan et al., 2008, Niemeyer et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2013). The proteins E, M, and N are mainly responsible for the assembly of the virions, while the S protein is involved in receptor binding and bears membrane fusion capabilities during CoVs infection (Saif, 1993). Thus, the S protein has an essential role in virus entry and determines tissue and cell tropism, as well as host range (Lu et al., 2015).",

These viruses have resulted in significant economic losses for the animal industry worldwide. Commonly, veterinary CoV infections are prevented through either modified live or inactivated CoV vaccines (Carmichael, 1999, Cavanagh, 2007, Hick et al., 2012, Olsen, 1993, Welter et al., 1993). The attenuated live viruses (BCoV, TGEV, and IBV) and a temperature-sensitive mutant (FIPV) are usually administered orally or intranasally to induce active mucosal immunity. In contrast, inactivated vaccines administered parenterally with adjuvant are available to induce active or passive immunity to BCoV, TGEV, CCoV, and IBV.",

In the 1960s, two human coronaviruses, human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) and OC43 (HCoV-OC43), were isolated from volunteers at the Common Cold Unit in Salisbury, United Kingdom (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967, Hamre and Procknow, 1966, Hendley et al., 1972, McIntosh et al., 1967, Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965). In 2004, human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis in The Netherlands (van der Hoek et al., 2004). In the following year, another CoV, human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), was identified in a patient with pneumonia in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2005). These human coronaviruses mainly cause subclinical or very mild infections and account for 10-15% of common colds (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003). However, more severe lower respiratory tract-related cases have been reported in infants and the elderly (Falsey et al., 1997, McIntosh et al., 1974, Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2000, Pene et al., 2003, Vabret et al., 2003).",

A decade later, the epidemic outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reminds us of the possibility for another potential pandemic on the scale of that of SARS. The first case was reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in September 2012 (Bermingham et al., 2012, Zaki et al., 2012), and since then, the MERS-CoV (i.e., the etiological agent behind MERS (de Groot et al., 2013)) has spread to 25 other countries, totaling 1782 laboratory-confirmed infections and 634 related deaths (case fatality rate = 35.6%) (WHO, 2016). The majority of human cases is reported in the Middle East, likely due to the presence of dromedary camels, which have been confirmed to carry live MERS-CoV and are a potential source of human infections (Azhar et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2014). However, whether dromedary camels are intermediary hosts or the original reservoir remains open at present.",

These events are a reminder that past geographical barriers for disease can be easily bypassed due to the increasingly globalized nature of the world. Unlike SARS-CoV, which after great disease control efforts by the Chinese government suddenly disappeared, the number of MERS cases is still on the rise, reinforcing the urgent need to develop vaccines or specific drugs targeted at CoVs, especially anti-epidemic MERS-CoV measures.",

Nonetheless, many antiviral agents have been identified, which have been summarized in several excellent reviews (Adedeji and Sarafianos, 2014, Keum and Jeong, 2012, Kumar et al., 2013, Liang, 2006, Ramajayam et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2006). Just as for SARS-CoV and other viruses (Liang, 2006, Lu et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2003), the 3C-like protease (3CLpro or Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) in MERS-CoV are responsible for processing the huge polyproteins into mature nsps (Baez-Santos et al., 2014, Kilianski et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2014) and are deemed to be a viable target for inhibitor screening. Small molecules, such as 5-chloropyridine ester, 6-mercaptopurine, and 6-thioguanine targeting MERS-CoV 3CLpro or PLpro have shown efficacy in inhibiting MERS-CoV replication in vitro (Chan et al., 2013, Cheng et al., 2015, Kilianski et al., 2013), though their activity and cytotoxicity needs to be further assessed in vivo.",

The S proteins of CoVs can be divided into two functional subunits (Xia et al., 2014): the N-terminal S1 subunit forms the globular head, and the membrane-embedded C-terminal S2 region forms the stalk region.

Specifically, the MERS-RBD can be further divided into two parts, the core subdomain and external subdomain. Although sharing a low amino acid sequence identity, the core subdomain structures of SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD can be superimposed well (Li et al., 2005), indicating a conserved core structure among the CoVs. In contrast, the external subdomain structure of these two proteins differs greatly. Interestingly, it is the external subdomain that is mainly involved in receptor binding and thus results in the different receptor usage between CoVs. In the MERS-RBD, the four antiparallel \u03b2-strands comprising the external region bind to the blade IV and V in the \u03b2-propeller of human CD26 (hCD26, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV), the receptor for MERS-CoV (Fig. 2C) (Raj et al., 2013). Accordingly, blocking the binding between the MERS-RBD and hCD26 can prevent virus attachment and inhibit virus infection. Intriguingly, the MERS-RBD stimulates the production of robust antibodies in mice and rabbits that neutralize virus infection (Ma et al., 2014a, Mou et al., 2013), suggesting that the S protein may represent a promising immunogen for eliciting neutralizing antibodies (nAbs).",

Similarly, MERS-S protein can be cleaved by different host proteases, which has previously been thoroughly reviewed (Lu et al., 2015). It is worth noting that MERS-CoV uses a two-step furin cleavage activation process to infect cells. Specifically, S is first cleaved during biosynthesis at position R751/S752. When MERS-CoV enters target cells, S is then further cleaved at R887/S888, the position adjacent to the fusion peptide within S2, and designated as S2' (Millet and Whittaker, 2014). The importance of the first cleavage has been confirmed by the analysis of bat coronavirus HKU4 (batCoV-HKU4), which is able to bind to hCD26 but is unable to infect cells due to the lack of the first proteolytic conserved motif recognized by furin. Introduction of a furin recognition site into S (Yang et al., 2015) or treatment of the pseudotyped HKU4 particles with trypsin confers particles with the ability to infect hCD26-expressing cells (Wang et al., 2014). Likewise, inhibition of S2\u2032 proteolysis by furin inhibitors decreases MERS-CoV infection in susceptible cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Millet and Whittaker, 2014), indicating both cleavages are critical for virus entry.",

Class I fusion proteins, represented by influenza hemagglutinin, are trimers of a single-chain precursor and primed by the cleavage of a trimeric precursor, forming six-helix bundles. Class II fusion proteins, represented by flavivirus prM/E proteins, are icosahedrally symmetrically, assemble as dimers on the virion, and are primed by cleavage of heterodimeric partner proteins to form homotrimers during membrane fusion. Class III fusion proteins are more complicated, including one or several proteins, and undergo no obvious priming event (Earp et al., 2005, Gao, 2007, Harrison, 2015, Kielian and Rey, 2006, Melikyan, 2008, White et al., 2008). CoV-S protein is a typical Class I fusion protein. Recently, the cryo-electron microscopy structures of MHV-S and HKU1-S proteins were reported (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016, Walls et al., 2016). Both structures reveal the overall pre-fusion architecture of full length S ectodomains (Fig. 2E and G), showing that the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) present in a \u201cV\u201d shape and therefore contributing to the overall triangular appearance of the S trimer (Fig. 2F and H). The S2 subunit connects to the viral membrane and is characterized by the presence of long \u03b1-helices (Fig. 2F and H). This structural information can serve as a foundation for structure-based design of \u03b2-CoV vaccine immunogens.",

Consistent with other typical Class I fusion proteins, the HRs in MERS-CoV S2 assemble into a canonical six-helix bundle called the fusion core, with three HR1 helices forming the central coiled-coil core and three HR2 chains surrounding the core in the HR1 side grooves (Fig. 2D). It is believed that the fusion core represents the post-fusion state of the part of the envelope structure. Although HR1 and HR2 are assumed to be located distal from one another in the pre-fusion state, a series of conformational changes occur in the envelope structure after S1 binding to the receptor that result in the binding of the fusion peptide located at the N-terminus of HR1 to the cell membrane. Through a short-lived intermediate state, HR1 and HR2 bend to bind each other, moving the virus membrane and cell membrane into close proximity to enable the membrane fusion process. In the intermediate state, both HRs are exposed, and inhibitors blocking the formation of the fusion core or that maintain HRs at the intermediate state can be used as drugs to inhibit MERS-CoV infection.",

Volz et al. further dissect the immunogenicity of the same vaccine in mice (Volz et al., 2015), and in agreement with the data obtained with MVA used as smallpox vaccine, immunizations through subcutaneous and intramuscular routes induce equivalent humoral and cellular immunity in mice. In addition, intramuscular vaccination evokes equal amounts of MERS-S-specific CD8+ T cells across low (1 \u00d7 106 PFU) to high (1 \u00d7 108 PFU) doses. When challenged with MERS-CoV, vaccinated mice exhibit little or no virus replication, irrespective of the route or dose used (Volz et al., 2015), indicating the efficacy of this MVA-MERS-S in the mouse model. More recent studies by Haagmans et al. further reveal that this vaccine significantly reduces MERS-CoV shedding in dromedary camels (Haagmans et al., 2016). Four dromedaries were inoculated twice at four-week intervals with 2 \u00d7 108 PFU MVS-MERS-S administered in nostrils and 1 \u00d7 108 PFU MVA-MERS-S delivered intramuscularly in the neck. In addition to the systemic humoral and cellular immunity evoked by the vaccine, low levels of MERS-CoV nAbs (virus neutralization titer of 1:20 to 1:40) are detected 3 weeks after the boost immunization through the nostrils. When challenged with a 1 \u00d7 107 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the virus via the intranasal route, the animals show only mild clinical signs and significantly reduced mean viral titers in the nasal respiratory tract compared to the control animals.",

In addition, the vector can be grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) without the need for additional animal-derived components in culture, and S protein can be synthesized upon serial amplification at low multiplicities of infection. Although its efficacy in mice and dromedaries has clearly been shown, there is still no data demonstrating the protective effect of MVA-MERS-S in a NHP model. This is important for human application because in some studies, high doses of MVA vector (>1 \u00d7 108 PFU) result in severe adverse events in humans (Gilbert, 2013). Thus, strict evaluation needs to be performed before MVA-MERS-S application in humans. In addition, one immunized dromedary (1/4) developed undetectable nAbs at the nostrils at the time of challenge and excreted low levels of infectious virus at 6 day post infection (dpi) after virus challenge (Haagmans et al., 2016). Further sequencing of the spike gene of the infectious virus showed no changes in the RBD region, excluding the possibility of escape mutations under the stress of vaccine-induced antibodies. Consequently, the underlying mechanisms that resulted in the failure of MVA-MERS-S to boost immunity warrant further investigation.",

            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the family Alphaviridae (Lundstrom, 2014). The structure protein of VEEV can be replaced by a heterologous protein of interest, resulting in a recombinant RNA replicon that can then be \u201cpackaged\u201d into VRPs using co-transfection with helper RNAs (Lundstrom, 2014). Due to the lack of structural protein gene(s), these replicons are replication-defective. VRP-based vaccines against prostate cancer and HIV-1 have been tested in Phase I clinical trials (Slovin et al., 2013, Wecker et al., 2012), with no toxicity associated with the immunization. In an astute study, Zhao et al. generated a vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV by inserting the S gene into the VRP (VRP-S) (Zhao et al., 2014). Mice were first immunized with 1 \u00d7 105 infectious units (IU) of VRP-S in the footpad and boosted with the same dose 4 weeks later. Mice were afterwards transduced with 2.5 \u00d7 108 PFU of Ad5-hCD26 and then infected with 1 \u00d7 105 PFU of MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain). By day 1 post infection, the viral load in hCD26 transgenic mice decreased to nearly undetectable levels (Zhao et al., 2014), indicating its efficacy in the mouse model. However, further evaluation in NHPs is required before human application.",

Although three intramuscular immunizations at three-to-four week intervals with plasmid DNA followed by electroporation stimulate MERS-S-specific nAbs in mice and rhesus macaques, the immunogenicity is not as efficient as the combination of the same plasmid DNA with S1 protein (Wang et al., 2015). Both mice and NHPs develop higher titer of nAbs when immunized with plasmid DNA twice within three-to-four weeks followed by S1 protein mixed with adjuvant than using either DNA vaccine or S1 protein alone. When challenged with approximately 3 \u00d7 108 PFU of MERS-CoV (Strain JordanN3), NHPs immunized with S DNA/S1 protein experience a lower peak volume of pulmonary disease than the S1 protein group and clear pulmonary infiltrates more rapidly (Wang et al., 2015), indicating that this strategy is a promising approach for MERS vaccine development.",

To increase the immunogenicity, Muthumani et al. optimized the expression of S (England/2/2013) in mammalian expression plasmid pVax1 through codon and RNA optimization, as well as the addition of a highly efficient immunoglobulin E (IgE) signal peptide instead of the N-terminal methionine. By EP-enhanced delivery three times at two-to-four-week intervals, the optimized DNA vaccine induces potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific nAbs in mice, macaques, and camels. Notably, in NHPs, two doses (0.5 mg vs. 2 mg per immunization) were assessed for immunogenicity, and both groups developed similar humoral immunity after three immunizations. However, the high-dose group produced more cellular immunity than the low-dose group. Four weeks after the final immunization, 7 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV (EMC/2012) was applied to inoculate NHPs. Compared to the control animals, both groups of vaccinated rhesus macaques exhibited significantly lower viral loads. Interestingly, all four NHPs immunized with lower doses of DNA vaccines failed to demonstrate radiographic evidence of infiltration at any time point, whereas half of animals vaccinated with higher doses showed evidence of minor infiltration that resolved by day 5 after infection. Whether this phenomenon is associated with the vaccine dose needs to be ascertained before human usage. Moreover, when this vaccine was used to immunize dromedaries, one of three animals failed to develop robust nAbs, pointing to the need for further research before veterinary use.",

Following subcutaneous vaccination with 10 \u03bcg/mouse of RBD-Fc in the presence of an equal volume of MF59 and following two boost doses with the same immunogen and adjuvants at three-week intervals, mice develop systemic humoral and cellular immunity against MERS-CoV.

For prophylaxis tests, low to high doses of mAbs were intraperitoneally injected 24 h before intranasal infection with 1 \u00d7 105 PFU of MERS-CoV. Both nAbs are able to significantly decrease MERS-CoV-specific RNA levels in the lungs at 4 dpi by over two logs at the 200 \u03bcg/mouse dose, compared to the isotype control antibody. More strikingly, the 20-\u03bcg dose of REGN3051 reduces virus levels as efficiently as the 200-\u03bcg dose, to near the level of detection in the assay. In addition, REGN3051 also exhibits potential for disease treatment. When the mAbs are administered 1 day after virus challenge, virus titers in the lungs of the mice are significant abated, with a greater than two log reduction at day 4 dpi, indicating pre- and post-exposure efficacy of the human mAbs in vivo.",

When m336 (1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) were injected intravenously into New Zealand white rabbits followed by intranasal infection with 1 \u00d7 105 TCID50 of MERS-CoV, complete protection was observed. In contrast, rabbits injected with control antibodies developed pulmonary disease characterized by mild perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation, with viral titers peaking at about 3 dpi. Viral load was significantly reduced in rabbits administered with m336 at both doses and through both routes (intravenous or intranasal). In addition, evidence of inflammation or virus antigen were not observed in rabbits administered with m336. Although m336 completely protected rabbit against MERS-CoV in a prophylactic setting, post-exposure treatment with this nAb did not lead to a significant reduction in viral RNA titers (Houser et al., 2016).",

However, the m336 mAb uses similar angles of approach as the host receptor to target the MERS-RBD (Fig. 3\n). The close proximity leads to strong steric clashes in one hot spot on the ligand, which is responsible for interaction with N229-linked carbohydrate moiety in the receptor, indicating that the protein-carbohydrate interaction might be important for hCD26 binding and the viral entry of MERS-CoV. In support of this observation, all N229 residues of CD26s from susceptible species are predicted to be glycosylated (Lu et al., 2015). In addition, the binding affinity of mutated hCD26 to the MERS-RBD is reduced by approximately 10-fold compared to wild-type hCD26 (Yu et al., 2015).",

Initially, two peptides based on HR2 were synthesized, and their inhibitory effects were tested in the pseudotyped virus system. Peptide P1, corresponding to the full-length HR2, is a potent inhibitor against viral infection, but a truncated peptide P2 is not (Gao et al., 2013). Similar correlations between the length of HR2 peptides and antiviral activity are observed in other HR2 peptides of Class I enveloped viruses (Jiang and Lin, 1995). The EC50 for inhibition of MERS-CoV infection by P1 is calculated to be \u223c3 \u03bcM. Lu et al. design a similar HR2-based peptide inhibitor (HR2P), with EC50 values ranging from 0.6 to 13.9 \u03bcM, depending on the cell line used for the assay. By introducing hydrophilic residues to increase salt-bridge interactions, one HR2P mutant (HR2P-M2) shows significant improvements in stability, solubility, and antiviral activity. The inhibitory activity against MERS-S-mediated cell-cell fusion is increased by approximately 69% (Gao et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2014). Further in vivo studies demonstrate that intranasally administered HR2P-M2 effectively protect hCD26 transgenic mice from MERS-CoV infection, with a >1000-fold reduction of viral titers in the lungs, and protection is enhanced by combining HR2P-M2 with interferon \u03b2 (Channappanavar et al., 2015).",

In the first, a modified adenovirus expressing hCD26 is administrated intranasally to mice, leading to human receptor expression in all cells of the lung, including those negatively expressing mouse CD26 (Zhao et al., 2014). After infection with MERS-CoV, the virus can be detected in lungs but is cleared by days 6\u20138 in young mice and days 10\u201314 in old mice. Moderate weight loss is only observed in old mice. Further, virus clearance is delayed in several strains of immunocompromised mice compared to wild type mice. Infected mice develop a pneumonia characterized by extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, which may recapitulate the respiratory disease observed in mild or moderate human cases but not the fatal cases nor the occasionally occurring kidney disease. Accordingly, this model can be difficult as an evaluative model for therapeutics.",

In addition, infectious virus can be isolated from the lungs and brain (Agrawal et al., 2015). However, when infected with lower doses of virus, this mouse model exhibits early and persistent lung infection and delayed occurrence of brain infection. Persistent inflammatory infiltrates are seen in the lungs and brain, as well as focal infiltrates in the liver, but pathology was not seen in other tissues. The efficiency of the MERS-RBD-based subunit vaccine and peptide inhibitor HR2P-M6 was proven using this mouse model (Tao et al., 2015). Similarly, transgenic mice developed by Zhao et al. also exhibit high viral burdens and viral-positive neurons after infection with MERS-CoV. Systemic inflammation with mild-to-severe pneumonia accompanied by liver, kidney, and spleen injury are also observed (Zhao et al., 2015).",

MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques develop mild-to-moderate clinical signs within 24 h, including elevated body temperature, reduced appetite, increased respiratory rate, cough, pilo-erection, and hunched posture. Clinical signs are transient and last for a few days. Radiographic changes show varying degrees of localized infiltration and interstitial markings, but none of the animals reach a clinical score requiring euthanasia (de Wit et al., 2013, Munster et al., 2013). Similar symptoms in infected rhesus macaques have also been observed by another independent group (Yao et al., 2014). Using this animal model, Falzarano et al. evaluate the effectiveness of combination treatment with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin, which are used to treat SARS patients (Stockman et al., 2006), and demonstrate anti-MERS-CoV effects in vitro (Falzarano et al., 2013a). Interestingly, the regimen reduces virus replication, moderates the host response, and improves clinical outcomes for infected animals (Falzarano et al., 2013b). This treatment strategy was further used for treatment of MERS-CoV-positive patients, but patients with multiple comorbidities who are diagnosed late in the course of their illness may unfortunately not benefit from this strategy (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014).",

Moreover, viral replication occurs both in the lower respiratory tract, which is also seen in rhesus macaque, and is detected in the blood and in nearly all tested tissues. This is associated with liver and/or kidney failure, as indicated by changes in blood chemistry. Taken together, these results suggest a more systemic dissemination in all infected common marmosets (Falzarano et al., 2014).

Due to its susceptibility in the virus life cycle, vaccines targeting either full length or truncated S protein have been developed, among which S DNA and S DNA/S1 protein candidates show the most advanced progress to protect immunized mice and NHPs from virus challenge and merit further development as candidate vaccines against MERS-CoV for potential human application. It is worth noting that aside from direct human protection against virus infection, an effective dromedary vaccine is also needed to stop ongoing camel-to-human transmission. Both MVA-S and S DNA evoke nAbs in dromedaries. Regardless, although MERS-CoV infected dromedaries may show no severe clinical manifestations, they may carry MERS-CoV viral RNA in their nasal excretions even in the presence of specific antibodies (Alagaili et al., 2014, Hemida et al., 2014, Khalafalla et al., 2015). The MVA-MERS-S vaccines developed by Haagmans et al. evoke a local mucosal immune response in the nostrils and thus reduce virus excretion after MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries, which may therefore be the most promising candidate vaccine for dromedary application.",

Although escape mutations might occur under the selection of nAbs, usage of nAb cocktails that target different epitopes may alleviate this problem. Moreover, a peptide inhibitor that was designed based on the fusion core structure of S has fortunately shown benefit during post-challenge infection, and its protection is enhanced by combining with interferon \u03b2 as assayed in Ad5-hCD26-tranduced mice (Channappanavar et al., 2015), which also merit further evaluation in NHPs.
