            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infects susceptible cells by binding to the cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) (1). It has been shown that the spike (S) protein of TGEV has, in addition to its pAPN binding site, a sialic acid binding activity, which is located at the N-terminal region of the protein (2). We have shown that binding to sialoglycoproteins in cell culture and in porcine brush border membrane preparations may be a pathogenicity factor affecting the enteropathogenicity of TGEV (3,4). Virus mutants that were not able to bind to sialic acids did not infect piglets (5,6). Thus, binding to sialoglycoproteins or mucins in the gastrointestinal tract may help the virus to reach the cellular receptor pAPN. The sialoglycoproteins serve as first attachment factors.",

Lectin precipitates were further used for a virus overlay binding assay. The lectins used in this study were wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which specifically binds N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acids; peanut agglutinin (PNA), which specifically recognizes galactose-\u03b2(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine, a disaccharide present in O-glycosylated proteins; and jacalin, which binds to the same sugars as PNA. The advantage of jacalin is that in contrast to PNA it binds to galactose-\u03b2(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine without prior neuraminidase treatment. In this way the specific lectin precipitation can be well combined with the virus binding to sialic acids. A high-molecular-mass protein that is recognized by the sialic acid binding activity of TGEV was also readily recognized by WGA and jacalin, suggesting that this sialoglycoprotein is highly O-glycosylated. Therefore we designated it mucin-like glycoprotein (MGP).",

The samples are stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until use.All preparation steps are performed on ice at 4 \u00b0C.The mucosa is weighed and 150 ml of preparation buffer A is added.After thawing on ice the mucosa is mixed in a regular household mixer on level 4 twice for 1 min each. After each mixing step, the suspension is filled in a tumbler and left on ice for 2 min. Then the foam is sucked off.The volume of the homogenate is determined in a measuring cylinder.The basolateral brush border membranes are precipitated by adding 1 M MgCl2 in an amount of 1/100 of the homogenate volume. The MgCl2 solution is added drop by drop under continuous stirring on ice followed by further stirring on ice for 15 min.The complete homogenate is then centrifuged for 18 min, 3687 \u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C (see\nNote 7). After centrifugation the supernatant is poured into fresh centrifuge beakers.In a second centrifugation step for 40 min, 16,000 \u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C, the apical brush border membrane fraction is pelleted (see\nNote 8). The pellet is floated in 35 ml of preparation buffer B; i.e., the buffer is rinsed over the pellet until the sediment is detached from the bottom.

For infection, the cells are washed three times with sterile PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and inoculated with a volume of 300 \u03bcl virus suspension per dish. With this small virus volume the plates are incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with careful shaking (see\nNote 12). Then the inoculum is removed and 20 ml DMEM is added to each plate followed by an incubation at 37 \u00b0C for about 24 h (see\nNote 13).As soon as the CPE is observed, the cell culture supernatant is harvested and centrifuged at 1900 \u00d7g for 10 min, 4 \u00b0C, to remove cell debris. The resulting supernatant is subjected to ultracentrifugation at 120,000 \u00d7g for 1 h, 4 \u00b0C, to pellet the virus particles (see\nNote 14). The resulting pellets are resuspended in PBS (total volume 400 to 500 \u03bcl).To make all sialic acid binding sites on the S protein available, a neuraminidase treatment of the concentrated virus particles is performed. Neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (1 U/ml, DADE Behring) is used in a final concentration of 50 mU/ml. The sample is then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min and cooled on ice.For purification of the virions, a continuous sucrose gradient (20\u201350% w/w in PBS) with a 60% sucrose cushion is prepared. The sucrose solutions are stirred at 50 \u00b0\u201360 \u00b0C and stored at room temperature until use. For the gradient centrifugation, SW 50.1 tubes, ultraclear (Beckman), are used (see\nNote 15). Per tube, 0.5 ml of the 60% sucrose cushion is applied overlaid by a gradient of 20 and 50% sucrose (using a gradient mixer and a pump). 2.5 ml of the 20% and 2 ml of the 50% solution are put into the gradient mixer. The gradient has a height corresponding to a 4-ml volume. The virus suspension is then carefully put on the top of the gradient using a 100-\u03bcl pipette. For purification, the gradient is ultracentrifuged at 150,000 \u00d7g for 3 h, 4 \u00b0C (see\nNote 16).After centrifugation, the visible virus band is carefully harvested using a 1-ml syringe and a 0.9 \u00d740-gauge needle (see\nNote 17). After dilution with PBS to a total volume of 4.5 ml, the virions are pelleted by ultracentrifugation (SW 50.1) at 150,000 \u00d7g for 1 h, 4 \u00b0C (see\nNote 16). The viral particles are resuspended in a small volume of PBS (depending on the pellet size in 100 to 300 \u03bcl). The sample is stored in aliquots at \u201320 \u00b0C.

For this purpose a semidry blotting system with two graphite electrodes is used. Six sheets of filter paper have to be soaked in anode I buffer, three filters in anode II buffer, and nine sheets of paper have to be soaked in the cathode buffer. The nitrocellulose membrane is wetted with pure water before use. Prior to use, all sheets and the membrane are cut to a size of 6 \u00d78 cm (just a bit larger than the size of the separating gel).The power supply is switched off and the gel unit is disassembled. The stacking gel is cut and discarded. One edge of the separating gel is cut to have a better orientation for blotting.The anode I papers are taken with a pinzette and excess buffer and air bubbles are eliminated from the papers by stripping with clean gloves. The papers are then placed onto the anode and the anode II papers placed onto the anode I papers like a sandwich.The nitrocellulose membrane is carefully taken out of the pure water and put on the papers. A little water is put on the upper side of the membrane, the better to get the gel from the glass slides by creating capillary forces. The free side of the gel is laid on the membrane, and the remaining glass slide on the other side is lifted carefully. A spacer is used to loosen the gel from the slide. After removing possible air bubbles, the cathode papers are put on the gel as described above for the anode papers.With a glass pipette residual air bubbles are stripped out of the sandwich and the cathode is put on the top. About 2 kg are put on the blotting apparatus (e.g., two bottles with 1 liter each) and the apparatus is connected to the power supply. The running conditions are 0.8 mA/cm2. For one membrane with 6 \u00d78 cm use 38 mA and let the apparatus run for 1 h.Once the transfer is completed, switch off the power supply and carefully lift the upper electrode. Normally some of the papers stick to this upper side. Search for the position of the gel and control if the prestained marker is visible on the nitrocellulose membrane. Discard the gel and mark the bands of the marker with a ballpoint pen because they sometimes get lost during later incubation steps.The nitrocellulose is than incubated in 20 ml blocking buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C on a rocking platform (see\nNote 20).\n",

            "text": "\nNeuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae is no longer available from DADE Behring. Alternatively, one can use, e.g., type V neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma).The pH of sodium acetate buffer solution has to be adjusted with acetic acid.A small aliquot of the TEMED bottle is stored at 4 \u00b0C for current use. In this way the original bottle is not opened too frequently, retaining the quality of the TEMED.Never adjust the pH of the running buffer, e.g. with HCl. This will disturb the running conditions during electrophoresis. The buffer has to be used without pH adjustment.It is better for the environment to use ethanol for buffers instead of methanol, which has to be discarded separately under specific conditions.The pH of the PBS solution has to be at 7.5 without any adjustment. It just has to be checked.For example, 3687 \u00d7g corresponds to 6000 rpm in a GSA rotor.16,000 \u00d7g corresponds to 12,500 rpm in a GSA rotor.3293 \u00d7g corresponds to 6000 rpm in an SS34 rotor.26,430 \u00d7g corresponds to 17,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor.31,300 \u00d7g corresponds to 18,500 rpm in an SS34 rotor. For the homogenization of the pellet, first carefully rinse the buffer over the pellet to loosen parts of it. Homogenization has to be performed on ice because it takes some time until the whole pellet is suspended.A small virus volume is important to get an efficient infection. In this way the particles have the best contact with the cell surface.For virus production at least five or, better, ten dishes with a diameter of 145 mm (Greiner) have to be used.120,000 \u00d7g corresponds to 28,000 rpm in an SW32 Beckman rotor. The centrifuge tubes have to be filled with 35 ml supernatant each. Do not use a smaller volume because then the tubes will be damaged by the centrifugation forces. Use ultraclear SW28 centrifuge tubes to see the white virus pellets better. Yellow pellets could be a hint that cellular proteins are still present in the supernatant. For this reason the first centrifugation step for getting rid of the cell debris is very important.It is important to use ultraclear tubes. In this way the \u201cwhite\u201c band formed by purified virus particles can be seen at the respective density after centrifugation.150,000 \u00d7g corresponds to 35,000 rpm in an SW55 Beckman rotor.The \u201cwhite\u201c virus particle band can best be seen with the help of scattering light produced by an external light source. The needle has to be carefully directed vertically into the tube from the top up to the height of the band. The harvested volume should not exceed 1 ml per tube.Different dilutions of BSA or transferrin are used as a standard. For the first measurement, the virus preparation is diluted 1:100. Sometimes higher concentrations have to be measured to get an extinction reading in a representative range. With the standard staining methods that are used by most of the assays for the determination of protein concentration (e.g., BCA assay) it is not possible to detect the TGEV proteins, so the photometric measurement at 280 nm is used.16,000 \u00d7g corresponds to 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge.For blocking, different buffers as well as nonfat dry milk were tried. A lot of them, especially the nonfat dry milk, lead to high backgrounds in the virus overlay binding assay. With blocking reagent from Roche, high backgrounds owing to the wrong blocking substance can be avoided.Vigorous washing of the membrane is necessary as in a virus overlay binding assay high backgrounds could be a problem.For reduction of a possible background, virus and antibodies are diluted in PBS-0.05% T instead of just PBS.By using Parafilm one needs just 500 \u03bcl virus or antibody dilution for one membrane. In this way the virus preparation lasts for a longer time.Usually Super Signal\u00ae (Pierce) is used, as the signals after the virus overlay assay may be quite weak. If the signals are stronger, it is better to use BM Chemoluminescence Blotting Substrate (Roche) as the background is lower with this substrate.\n",

            "text": "Fig. 1.: Binding of TGEV to lectin-precipitated brush border membrane proteins from two different suckling piglets (S1, S2). Brush border membranes were treated either with neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (+VCNA) or mock-treated (\u2013VCNA) and then precipitated with: (a) wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), (b) jacalin, or (c) peanut agglutinin (PNA) agarose. A virus overlay binding assay was performed after blotting of the brush border membrane proteins. Two main bands were recognized by the virus after lectin precipitation. The lower band of about 150 kDa presents the cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN). The PNA-precipitation (c, right side) shows clearly that binding to pAPN is not sialic-acid-dependent. TGEV binding to the high-molecular-mass band (arrow) is clearly sialic-acid-dependent, as after VCNA treatment binding is eliminated or at least strongly reduced. The strong precipitation of MGP by WGA gives a hint that it is highly sialylated or has a strong content of N-acetylglucosamine. Jacalin binds to galactose-\u03b2(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine, a disaccharide present in O-glycosylated proteins. The strong MGP band (b) demonstrates that this protein is highly O-glycosylated. Therefore we designated it mucin-like glycoprotein (MGP). For the same reason it is precipitated by PNA (c), but PNA precipitation is not as good without neuraminidase treatment. After neuraminidase treatment (+VCNA) the virus is not able to bind to MGP because of the missing sialic acids.",
