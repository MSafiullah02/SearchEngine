Importantly, many autacoid \u201cinflammatory\u201d stimuli increase permeability in airway subepithelial microvessels but are without this effect in the pulmonary circulation.20 Within a few minutes after exposure to histamine-type mediators (including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor [PAF]-acether, and bradykinin), plasma protein indices are significantly increased in sampled airway surface liquids in guinea pig and human airways.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 This response is dose dependent, reversible, and reproducible. In accordance with this, the exudative response to histamine has been used to assess the onset and duration of action of antihistamine drugs in human nasal airways.30\n",

An early demonstration of prompt challenge-induced microvascular-epithelial exudation in guinea pig tracheobronchial airways suggested that plasma macromolecules appeared on the mucosal surface independent of their charge and size.29 The indiscriminate microvascular-epithelial passage of macromolecules explains why the process is called exudation rather than transudation, the latter name emphasizing fluid movement.35, 36, 37 Thus different-sized plasma proteins have appeared on challenged but intact guinea pig and human airway mucosal surfaces in nearly the same concentration ratios as occur in circulating blood.24, 29, 31, 38 Similar data have been reported in asthmatic patients by Out et al.32\n",

Furthermore, the plasma exudation response to autacoids has not been associated with an increase in lymphatic transport of plasma tracers.27 Hence, in agreement with a lack of high-permeability edema, increased draining of proteins from the mucosal tissues has not occurred. The wet/dry weight ratio of the airway wall has not increased29 nor has the subepithelial tissue been appreciably expanded to indicate presence of actual edema.47, 52 A morphometric study in allergic rats also demonstrated that the airway-narrowing effect of allergen challenge reflected smooth muscle constriction without edema.53 Prolonged stimulation of rat airways with allergens, such as house dust mite, has increased the number of subepithelial microvessels, although with little signs of mucosal edema.51\n",

It is also of note that the endothelial gaps through which plasma macromolecules escape the circulation are not commonly used by leukocytes.74, 75\n",

There is a profuse subepithelial microcirculation carrying systemic blood in human nasal airways, as well as in the entire human tracheobronchial airway.20 At any challenge site, postcapillary venules of this circulation can react through prompt formation of high-permeability endothelial gaps. This noninjurious response reflects an active process in endothelial cells that is under physiologic and pharmacologic control.33, 34, 36\n, Gaps might open preferentially in the venular wall facing the epithelium.74, 76 At a given challenge burden, the gaps will be open for only a limited time. For example, at a given concentration of histamine, the duration of plasma extravasation might not last more than about 10 to 20 minutes, even in the continued presence of this type of agent.33, 36\n, It is only if the challenge burden increases that the extravasation will be longer lasting. Challenge with allergen or PAF-acether can cause both an early- and a late-phase plasma extravasation response.27, 50, 77 Reflecting the time course of extravasation, plasma proteins then emerge early and late on the mucosal surface at the site of challenge (Fig 1).",

By using this set-up, serosal and mucosal hydrostatic pressures could be regulated separately and affect epithelial transmission of macromolecular tracers in either direction.89, 90 The guinea pig trachea was considered suited for these experiments because of similarities to human airways, including a pseudostratified epithelium and a profuse subepithelial microcirculation. The guinea pig trachea also exhibited similar responses to human airways with regard to plasma exudation evoked by allergen and nonneural mediator challenges.91 Additionally, the tracheal cartilage should be an asset because it would counteract confounding distortions of the tissue when pressure is increased.",

Patchy distribution of epithelial derangement, including early signs of epithelial regeneration, might be common in publicized histologic graphs of diseased airways.149 Some information on patchy epithelial damage and repair can also be found in studies exploring bronchial mucosal distribution of molecules of interest.150, 151 However, a systematic analysis seems to be lacking.",

(Specific data were obtained in guinea pig and human airways.)II.At asthma-like nonsanguineous denudation, a well-sustained, plasma exudation\u2013derived active barrier involving a leukocyte-rich fibrin-fibronectin net promptly covers the naked basement membrane.

(Specific data were obtained in guinea pig airways.)IV.At exposure to inhaled insults, which cause epithelial shedding in asthmatic patients, the ensuing denudation areas can be exceedingly patchy. This limitation is important because epithelial regeneration cells are produced all around individual denudation patches. Thus dedifferentiated epithelial cells will rapidly replace provisional covers of plasma exudate\u2013derived gels in small-sized denuded spots.

Without causing appreciable edema, extravasated plasma macromolecules move between yielding epithelial cells to appear locally on the mucosal surface at the very site of challenge. A slightly increased hydrostatic pressure affecting the basolateral aspects of epithelial cells seems causally involved in the paracellular epithelial transmission of extravasated plasma. Unless the challenge grows, this prompt local exudative response is of brief duration.",

Even when both columnar and basal epithelial cells are shed (denudation), the naked basement membrane will promptly receive a provisional barrier of exuded plasma. The activated plasma forms a gel-like structure involving a leukocyte-rich fibrin-fibronectin net covering the basement membrane. The gel remains and is continuously supplied by fresh plasma until a new cover of regenerated epithelial cells is established. In a dynamic plasma-derived molecular milieu, ciliated and secretory epithelial cells surrounding denuded spots dedifferentiate into flattened and rapidly migrating regeneration cells. Thus airways with patchy denudation sites are not without barriers or might only transiently exhibit a reduced absorption barrier. Barrier restoration is potentially prompt, even in patients with severe conditions with extensive but patchy denudation of the epithelium.",

            "text": "Prompt and speedy epithelial regeneration in patients with severe asthma counteracts the risk of severely escalating barrier breaks. However, epithelial regeneration processes also evoke disease-like effects. In experimental in vivo studies the mere process of denudation/regeneration on top of an uninjured basement membrane has caused plasma exudation, granulocyte recruitment/activation, mucus secretion, proliferation of fibroblast/smooth muscle cells, and thickening of the reticular basement membrane. Hence exaggerated epithelial regeneration occurring in plasma exudation hot spots seems worthy of consideration as a factor contributing not only to a speedy epithelial regeneration and a maintained absorption barrier but also to inception and worsening of asthma.\nWhat is currently known?\u2022The bronchial mucosa in vivo in asthmatic patients exhibits exudation of plasma and epithelial shedding, yet there is no increased absorption of inhaled molecules.\u2022The above 3 features can be reconciled thanks to additional in vivo observations:\u2014The asymmetry and plasticity of the epithelial lining allows outward passage of macromolecules without altering its tightness as a barrier toward molecules deposited on the mucosal surface. The epithelial transmission of nonsieved plasma macromolecules appears to be driven by a small subedematous increase in hydrostatic pressure transiently and noninjuriously affecting the basolateral aspect of the pseudostratified epithelial lining cells.\u2014Epithelial regeneration mechanisms after shedding operate promptly to restitute barrier functions in vivo. Even at denudation, the naked but intact basement membrane will be promptly covered, first by a plasma-derived fibrin-fibronectin net and with continuously by fresh plasma and leukocytes. This cover is a coarse physical and highly potent biological barrier. Furthermore, it provides a milieu in which all types of epithelial cells bordering the denuded area dedifferentiate into speedily migrating regeneration cells, which are tethered together. In the likely event of quite patchy denudation in vivo, a cellular barrier will thus speedily replace the provisional plasma-derived barrier, leaving little opportunity for increased absorption of inhaled molecules. However, the regeneration sites are also inflammatory and remodeling hotspots, suggesting the possibility that exaggerated epithelial regeneration at multiple denudation sites contributes to development and worsening of asthma.\n\nWhat more do we need to know?\u2022The basic features of airway plasma exudation indicate that it has roles in first-line defense on the surface of the intact mucosa in health and disease. Hence we need to know further details of the involved mechanisms and how their in vivo functions fare in comparison with other defense mechanisms operating at the mucosal surface, including mucus secretion and AMP production.\u2022We need to define in detail several additional features of plasma exudation in asthma, as summed up by the following questions: To what extent does plasma exudation actually occur? Is there an exudative hyperresponsiveness to challenge with microvascular permeability agents? To what extent does exuded plasma contribute to airway plugs? What is the relative contribution of cell-derived versus plasma-derived proteins in asthmatic patients, including coagulation and complement molecules? On that note, is plasma exudation an \u201call-in\u201d defense/disease mechanism or are there conditions when individual plasma protein systems are selectively activated?\u2022Plasma exudation in response to asthma-like epithelial denudation is distinguished by means of sustained occurrence, providing both physical and biological protection. We need to know what plasma-derived molecules are essential for epithelial regeneration and whether any cell-derived molecule is also essential in this process in vivo. We need to know the extent of patchiness of epithelial denudation and how we can define such hot spots in asthmatic patients. How do inflammatory and remodeling responses evoked by epithelial regeneration events fare compared with other such mechanisms in vivo at asthma inception, asthma development, and asthma exacerbation?\n\n",

After local mucosal challenge, autacoids induce high-permeability gaps between endothelial cells in postcapillary venules (I). Venules belong to a profuse subepithelial microcirculation distinct from the pulmonary circulation.20 Through these gaps, plasma macromolecules enter interstitial spaces, where an increased hydrostatic pressure (II) will affect basolateral aspects of epithelial cells. A pressure increase of only 5 cm of H2O is sufficient for inducing paraepithelial transmission of plasma macromolecules (III). Exudation occurs without prior edema formation, without sieving, and without compromising the epithelial barrier. In accord with this, histamine-challenged human airway mucosa in vivo exudes albumin (Alb) and \u03b12-macroglobulin (a2M) at a concentration ratio (a2M/Alb) that is similar to that in circulating plasma.31, 32 Furthermore, absorption of molecules deposited on the mucosal surface is not increased. Plasma extravasation (I) is an active endothelial cell event under physiologic and pharmacologic control.33, 34 The ensuing epithelial passage (III) appears to be a hydrostatic pressure\u2013driven hydraulic mechanism driven by the extravasated plasma itself (II). Microvascular-epithelial exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules is a prompt, reversible, repeatable, and usually short-lasting innate immune response.",

Plasma exudation produces and continuously supplies a gel-like cover involving a fibrin-fibronectin net. Also, leukocytes, especially neutrophils, are recruited and activated. Eosinophils already present in the airway are activated by primary cytolysis. The gel serves as a highly active provisional barrier and milieu for speedy epithelial regeneration. All epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch, notably including both secretory and ciliated cells, promptly dedifferentiate into flattened regeneration cells. As in micrographs of bronchi of asthmatic patients, basal cells might not be readily distinguished from regeneration cells. Loosely linked, the latter migrate from all sides over the denuded patch at a speed of several micrometers per minute. When a new cell cover is complete, plasma exudation stops, the plasma-derived gel dislodges, and proliferation plus redifferentiation toward a normal epithelium begins in the previously denuded area. Epithelial regeneration in vivo alone induces recruitment and activation of granulocytes, hyperexudation, hypersecretion, proliferation not only of epithelial cells but also of fibrocyte/smooth muscle cells, and thickening of the epithelial reticular basement membrane.
