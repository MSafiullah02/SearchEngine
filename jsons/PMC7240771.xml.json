In situ hybridization showed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the lung and renal parenchyma (boxed areas show examples in each organ). Immunofluorescence of the lung specimen showed cells with SARS-CoV-2 protein (boxed areas), and immunofluorescence of the kidney specimen showed SARS-CoV-2 protein in areas of the glomerular epithelial (orange arrow), endothelial (white arrows), and tubular (white outline) cells.
