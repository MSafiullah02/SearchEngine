The World Health Organization (WHO) released in February 2020 an interim guidance [1] on the rational use of PPE for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The guidance state that to minimize the need for PPE, WHO recommends the \"use of physical barriers to reduce exposure to the COVID-19 virus such as glass or plastic windows.\"",

The construction of this barrier ensures that the hospital will be able to conserve their supply of PPEs The constructed barrier, is made of an \"acrylic window\" designed to separate the clinician and the patient, it also features two fixed gloves through which the clinician can place both hands and be able to collect throat or nasopharyngeal swabs. The full diagram of the barrier is provided in According to the WHO guideline on Infection prevention and control [2] , the hospital should perform standard, contact, and airborne precautions during the collection of respiratory specimens from patients with severe symptoms suggestive of pneumonia. This also includes placement of patient in a single room with negative pressure air handling, if available, and clinicians' use of PPE including respirator N95 or FFP2 standard, long-sleeved fluid-resistant gown, gloves and eye protection. If a negative pressure room is not accessible, we need to place the patient in a single confined room. The isolation device is the design of Tseng Yu-Chi and Tseng Kai-Chen. The design shows that a negative pressure room is not required, but it needs to ensure that air does not circulate to other areas. The whole specimen collection process involves two persons: (1) clinician A performs the swabbing (Fig.2) ; and (2) Clinician B donned in standard PPE is located outside the exam room to check on the fixed gloves regularly and delivers the specimen to a designated location for further examination. All surfaces that are possibly contaminated, especially the examination area, including the fixed gloves, will then be wiped with disinfectant.",
