Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were the standard for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from respiratory secretions collected by nasal and oropharyngeal swabs. 8 A high false-negative rate (FNR) has been reported for these tests. Results from quantitative RT-PCR could be affected by the variation of viral RNA sequences or by the viral load in different anatomic sites during the disease natural history. 8 By estimate, FNR from one-time testing was high as 30% to 50% in real COVID-19 cases. 8 A recent report on 1014 COVID-19 cases found that only 59% of patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs at presentation, while chest computed tomography had higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of Consequently, the clinical presentation could be helpful in identifying suspected COVID-19 cases and we think that sore throat should not be considered a rare symptom as reported by Sun et al. 1 This could lead to undiagnosed cases and to the spread of infection. Patients with the suspected disease should be isolated (use of individual rooms was recommended, with negative pressure if possible), and health personnel should use waterproof gowns, gloves, goggles, and surgical masks or FFP2 masks. 10 Further studies are needed to clarify the importance of pharyngodynia in COVID-19.",
