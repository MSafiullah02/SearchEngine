Szretter and co-workers11 found that deleting interleukin 6 or macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP) 1\u03b1 had no effect on highly pathogenic H5N1 disease or virus replication, whereas lack of interleukin-1-receptor signalling enhanced disease and delayed virus clearance. Lack of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1 also increased disease severity but had no effect on virus replication or outcome. The investigators commented that because of the functional redundancy of many cytokines and chemokines, deleting more than one of these genes might have had a greater (presumably more adverse) effect on the course of disease, and concluded that mice are suitable for evaluating agents that \u201cmodulate the inflammatory response induced by H5N1 viruses, either alone or in combination with antiviral therapy\u201d.11\n",

In another case-control study, Schlienger and co-workers26 showed that current prescriptions for statins (within 30 days) were associated with a 53% reduction in 30-day pneumonia mortality. In a retrospective cohort study by Mortensen and colleagues,27 current statin use was associated with a 46% reduction in 30-day pneumonia mortality. However, Majumdar and colleagues28 reached a different conclusion; their prospective cohort study failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of statins and they ascribed the apparent benefits of statin treatment seen in other studies to a \u201chealthy user effect\u201d. Although the healthy user effect does exist and can be important, many \u201chealthy users\u201d in the study by Schlienger and colleagues26 had been given statins in the past (more than 30 days before hospital admission) but were not taking them currently, yet only current users were protected.",

However, it is worth noting that the severity of experimental endotoxin-induced acute lung injury is directly proportional to the duration and intensity of nuclear factor (NF) \u03baB activity and that downregulating NF\u03baB even after the onset of pulmonary inflammation is beneficial.43 NF\u03baB is known to suppress the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of interferon in influenza virus-infected cells.44 Both statins24 and PPAR agonists31, 32, 33, 38 downregulate NF\u03baB activity.",

Different influenza virus subtypes respond differently to chloroquine, with H3N2 and H1N1 viruses being more susceptible than certain H5 viruses.48 Structural determinants on subunit 2 of the haemagglutinin molecule seem to determine the antiviral response.

This finding suggests that an antiviral effect might have occurred but that it failed to bring about clinical improvement because cytokine dysregulation was able to proceed regardless of whether virus replication continued or was suppressed. If this is what happened, it is conceivable that limiting virus replication with chloroquine while at the same time treating the immune response with a fibrate, statin, or other promising agents might have led to clinical recovery. Support for this interpretation comes from another report on the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses of influenza virus-infected mice with secondary pneumococcal pneumonia.50 In this model, there were no differences in the outcomes of mice with or without bacteraemia or with high or low levels of bacterial growth in their lungs; all mice in all groups developed rapidly fatal illness. When mice were dually infected with influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and then treated with either ampicillin or clindamycin, ampicillin was more effective in clearing pneumococci from the lung, but survival was improved with clindamycin.51 It seems that factors determining survival involved something more than killing the infecting pneumococci. In other studies of mice infected with influenza viruses alone, other macrolides have been shown to inhibit nitric oxide production, increase interleukin 12 in bronchoalveolar fluid, reduce both virus replication and pulmonary inflammation, and improve survival.52, 53\n",

Resveratrol also targets TLR cell signalling pathways and interferes with the related upregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the inflammatory host response.55 These important findings appear to have attracted no attention from influenza scientists.",

The research must include the human pharmacokinetics of each agent, potential dosing regimens for acute treatment and prophylaxis, important drug\u2013drug interactions, and safety, especially in children and pregnant women. Any agent found to be effective could be stockpiled and would be available and affordable to people in developing countries on the first pandemic day (figure\n).
