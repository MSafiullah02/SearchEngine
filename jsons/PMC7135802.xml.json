The epidemiology of sepsis and severe sepsis has changed dramatically in the last decades but the absence of standardized definitions in different areas of the world, and the lack of large-scale studies based on significant cohorts, do not permit epidemiologic certainty [1]. Estimates of the epidemiology of sepsis published rely mostly on discharge diagnosis data. Annual incidence is high in the United States, around 300 per 100,000 population and mortality is also high, 18% to 28% [2], [3]. Morbidity and mortality depend on the characteristics of the host and the infecting microbe. In terms of incidence and mortality, the situation regarding sepsis and severe sepsis in such areas as Latin America [4], Africa [5], and Asia [6] may be worse than in developed countries.",

In adults, both in the United States and Europe, most (around 80%) patients admitted in ICUs with the diagnosis of sepsis have already been hospitalized for other causes and come from the hospital wards [13], [14]. Severe bacteremia and sepsis caused by the classic pathogens Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pyogenes is rarely found now, and has been replaced by sepsis caused by commensal microbes, which infect individuals with conditions that compromise their skin and mucosal barriers or their immune systems. Advances in surgical techniques including transplant medicine, and increased survival of patients with trauma, splenectomy, and neutropenias are, in part, caused by advances in the treatment of sepsis associated with these conditions. In 40% of the patients no responsible microorganism is isolated, in most the organism isolated from blood or the infection site was one that usually does not cause infection in healthy persons, and frequently the infection is polymicrobial [12], [14]. Although for many years gram-negative bacteria were found in most bacteremic patients with severe sepsis, the percentage of cases associated with blood isolation of gram-positive pathogens has increased in the last decades and now Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci are responsible for 30% to 50% of the cases. Another recent tendency is to isolate fungi (5%\u201312%), notably species of Candida\n[14], [15]. Difficult-to-treat pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant S aureus. A new syndrome of severe necrotizing pneumonia produced by infection by community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus led to ICU admissions because of the severe manifestations [16]. The organism is now also considered a hospital pathogen [17].",

The global incidence of tetanus has been estimated at about 1 million cases per year. In the United States the reported cases and deaths from tetanus have decreased substantially since the 1940s because of successful vaccination efforts [34]. The risk of developing clinical tetanus after an acute puncture or laceration is higher in patients older than 60 years, a reflection of waning immunity, with a significant proportion of cases occurring in women [35], and a low mortality rate. Injection drug users are a growing population at risk [36]. In sharp contrast, the epidemiology of generalized tetanus in developing countries, where mortality figures may be up to 280 times higher, follows closely the problem of lack of immunization efforts. In some areas, neonatal tetanus, occurring in the offspring of unvaccinated women, causes approximately 50% of the cases and mortality. Even worse, mothers with a past history of babies suffering neonatal tetanus accounted for more than one third of all cases in one study [37].",

Laboratory rats may be infected and transmit disease to humans. Hantavirus epidemics have been associated with seasons or years of increased rodent populations. The viruses, basically parasites of wild rodents, produce severe pulmonary edema (secondary to increased vascular permeability), hemoconcentration, and shock in humans. The disease commonly starts with severe myalgia and abdominal pain. Severe hypoxia and shock are managed in the ICU and, if the patient survives, reversion of the vascular leak permits complete recovery. Diagnosis is based on the fact that IgM and IgG antibodies are present very early in the illness and can be measured by ELISA on admission. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in blood samples and immunohistochemical staining of tissues may detect hantavirus. Treatment consists of judicious administration of fluids, cardiotonic drugs, and other supportive measures.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of FLF usually initiates with the exposure of a susceptible person to an agent capable of inducing severe hepatic injury, even though the exact etiology remains undisclosed in most cases of FLF. Similarly, the pathophysiologic mechanism involved in the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in children with FLF has not been fully defined [77]. Viral agents may cause damage to hepatocytes either by direct cytotoxic effect or as a result of hyperimmune response. Apparently, the interaction between the infectious agent and the host determines the incidence of FLF. Fulminant hepatic failure is an uncommon but devastating illness in which the liver fails in a short period of time (<8 weeks in the initial definition [1]) in the absence of chronic liver disease. It must be distinguished from the much more common acute decompensation that develops abruptly and without warning in patients with chronic liver disease. In fulminant hepatic failure, mortality rate is higher and significant morbidity results from cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, which are rare in patients with chronic disease. Fulminant hepatic failure is defined by the development of coagulopathy and encephalopathy and is associated with rapid progression of multiple organ system failure. Acetaminophen has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of fulminant hepatic failure in the United States and accounts for 39% and perhaps as much as 50% of the cases [2], [3]. Mortality rate is high but recovery is possible in 20% to 50% of patients with supportive care. The decision to proceed to liver transplantation is complicated. Although the course may be protracted, recovery is usually complete. Liver transplantation remains the sole lifesaving option for many patients. Patients who have fulminant hepatitis have a mortality of up to 50% and should be transferred immediately to a facility that offers liver transplantation [78]. Nevertheless, with an improved understanding and recognition of the syndrome, more aggressive medical therapy, intensive monitoring, and the advent of orthotopic liver transplantation as a treatment option, survival rates have improved considerably [79]. FLF constitutes a medical emergency with a tendency to evolve rapidly and the prompt response of experienced clinicians is imperative for a successful outcome to be achieved.",
