Since the outbreak of infection with avian influenza H5N1 virus in 2003, WHO has reported 277 laboratory confirmed cases in ten countries with a mortality rate of about 60%.1 So far the virus has spread only from animals to human beings. However, human-to-human transmission potentiated by viral genomic mutation and reassortment of genomic subunits could be imminent. Recently, the first cases of probable human-to-human transmission have been reported.2, 3 The H5N1 influenza A virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus in which the genome consists of eight segments encoding ten viral proteins including haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, polymerase proteins, and nucleoprotein.4\n",

Antiviral treatment was given, including rimantadine 100 mg twice daily on days 10 and 11 and then oseltamivir 150 mg per day from day 11 for 10 days. After admission, he became increasingly irritable and confused, followed by lowered consciousness. He developed respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation was initiated.

Both plasmids were linearised with appropriate restriction enzymes. Two sense and two antisense RNA probes were prepared by in-vitro transcription with T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Since H5N1 is a negative-stranded RNA virus, sense probes were defined as the probes that detect the viral RNA (negative-stranded), whereas antisense probes detected mRNA and complement RNA (cRNA), which are both positive-stranded.",

Brain neurons were found to be infected by the virus. We also saw regional variations in positive neuronal distribution and negative neurons next to positive neurons. Possible reasons might include differing densities of the avian influenza virus receptor in human beings, differences in blood supply pathways and nerve connections that allow virus-target cell contact, and differing viral loads and viral replication stages. The detection of positive-stranded RNA by RT-PCR and in-situ hybridisation could indicate active viral replication in the brain. The virus could reach the CNS by penetrating the blood-brain barrier or by invading the afferent fibres of the olfactory, vagal, trigeminal, and sympathetic nerves after replicating in the respiratory mucosa, as has been shown in animals.24\n",

Since this contrast was unexpected, lung tissue was sampled and analysed extensively, but the number of cells with viral localisation was consistently low in both patients. With the technique's very high detection sensitivity (close to 100%), the percentages of positive epithelial cells recorded in this study could be reasonable estimates of H5N1-infected cells. In view of the low number of infected cells in patient 1 and the absence of cells with positive signals after in-situ-hybridisation in patient 2, direct viral injury to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract is, in our view, unlikely to cause such severe pathological changes. The lack of histopathological changes in the brain, despite our findings indicating active viral replication in the region, also suggests that viral replication might not be specifically pathogenic. Recent in-vitro and in-vivo studies have indicated that hyperinduction of cytokines and chemokines could take part in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza.5, 7, 8, 27, 28, 34\n",

False-positive results might be caused by the presence of virus in blood perfusing the organs without actual viral replication in the tissue parenchyma.35 Detection of positive-stranded RNA in the lung, heart, intestines, placenta, brain, and trachea in our study could imply that viral replication occurs in these organs.
