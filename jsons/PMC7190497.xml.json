It was originated from the Wuhan city, the capital of China's Hubei province on December 29, 2019 (C. Huang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020). Outside of China, the first case of the disease in Thailand (Joseph, 2020) and Japan (WHO, 2020j) was confirmed on January 13 and 16 respectively. In order to reduce its spreading outside China, Wuhan and other cities in the region were placed on lockdown on January 23 (BBC, 2020d). The disease causing virus has since spread to other regions in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania, developing into a global 2019\u20132020 COVID-19 pandemic by March (Chan et al., 2020; JHU, 2020; M, 2020; Nature, 2020b; Reuters, 2020a; Reuters, 2020b; Rothe et al., 2020; S, 2020).",

The virus was formerly known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) named by World Health Organization (WHO). Due to its massive global outbreak followed by China, WHO designated the 2019-nCoV virus as sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30 (Wee et al., 2020; WHO, 2020s). In February 2020, WHO announced the official name of this disease for public communications as COVID-19, where CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 is for the first outbreak year of that disease (WHO, 2020i). Based on the ongoing global COVID-19 contagion, the WHO declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 as there is no safe place from its effects (McKay et al., 2020; WHO, 2020t). According to figures compiled by U.S. based Johns Hopkins University, as of April 20, 2020, >2,480,506 total confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 205 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 170,397 deaths whereas >646,330 people have since recovered (JHU, 2020). As of April 20, 2020, the overall rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 6.87% based on Johns Hopkins University statistics (JHU, 2020; Worldometer, 2020a).

            "text": "This novel virus is closely linked to the SARS virus (NCPERE, 2020). Although all the coronaviruses have the ability to infect human and develop severe respiratory syndrome, the novel virus has been considered as superior than other coronaviruses, i.e., SARS, MERS, and influenza. Because the number of confirmed infections of COVID-19 is higher than the total number of suspected SARS cases, the novel coronavirus is assumed to be more contagious than SARS with respect to community spread and severity (De Wit et al., 2016). Consequently, the novel CoV is currently spreading from continent to continent, which must be reduced to stop its potentially devastating impact on human. Besides, this epidemic driven to unpredictable future is causing anxiety among people. During this public health emergencies, a lots of information, news and health messages about coronavirus available online and offline when they are not misleading, can be overwhelming and confusing. Hence it is very important to stay informed during this outbreak. Moreover, this novel virus is new to the scientific world and many features of the virus are still not understandable due to its new strains (Qing and Gallagher, 2020). Hence, the worldwide researchers are now very active to explore the new insights of the virus in order to understand its biological character and mode of spreading. This real boost of research interest on the virus has actually started after the emergence of SARS and MARS, and subsequent COVID-19 (Fig. 2\n). According to google scholar search as of April 20, 2020, at least 39,100 English-language papers reporting coronavirus have been published since the outbreak (January 2020) (Stoye, 2020). Already, there are a number of review articles summarizing the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, and management of COVID-19 (Z. Huang et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020a; Lupia et al., 2020; Moriyama et al., 2020; Rodr\u00edguez-Morales et al., 2020; Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020; Shereen et al., 2020; Song and Karako, 2020; Vellingiri et al., 2020). However, the ongoing situation has urgently sought for constructive summary about the known features of COVID-19 attack, its current strength of infecting people and future predictions about long-run epidemic. In this review, all the very basic information related to the coronavirus causing infection are highlighted and the current global situation of the disease outbreak are discussed. The purpose of this study is to aggregate as well as present the existing information and the relevant global data on COVID-19 outbreak among vulnerable communities. In this current pandemic situation, this review is expected to be easily understandable and accessible to all categories of readers for providing continuous guidance and effective control for the future outbreaks.",

            "text": "A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism (Wikipedia, 2020d). A complete virus particle is called virion. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, i.e., animals, plants, microorganisms (Koonin et al., 2006). There are millions of types of viruses in the environment (Breitbart and Rohwer, 2005). Among these, human corona viruses (HCoVs) are common in humans causing for around 30% of cases of the common cold (Mahy, 1980; Mesel-Lemoine et al., 2012). In 1968, coronaviruses were first discovered and named so due to their crown-like bulbous appearance (Latin \u201ccorona\u201d means crown) in electron micrographs (Nature, 1968) as shown in Fig. 3\n. The ubiquitous pathogens, coronaviruses (CoVs) can be found in vertebrates, i.e., birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals (Brenda G. Hogue and Machamer, 2008). They are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (Yin and Wunderink, 2018), which can infect human and thus cause a variety of diseases, including respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, encephalitis, and hepatitis(Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) Usually, CoVs are enveloped, spherical lipid bilayer (approximately 120 nm in diameter), with a prominent fringe of 20-nm-long, petal shaped surface projections (spikes) composed of a heavily glycosylated type I glycoprotein, spike protein (Masters, 2006). In the structure of CoV, at least three structural (envelope) proteins like membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) are coordinated with a positive-strand RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases (kb) in length (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Some CoVs have additional envelope proteins like hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and nucleocapsid (N) (Hogue and Machamer, 2008). The structure of CoV is responsible for its vibrant morphological, biological functions or reproductive modes in different environmental conditions.",

Among these four genera, alpha- and beta-CoV are mainly responsible for human infection. Till today, seven strains of human CoVs (HCoVs) have been specified causing respiratory tract infections in human (Table 1\n). However, the risk factor or rate of infection of coronaviruses vary significantly. In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe first identified a new group of human CoV-OC43 in the respiratory tract of an adult human showing common cold symptoms (Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1966). The SARS outbreak caused by SARS-CoV was emerged 18 years ago in Foshan, Guangdong, China in November 2002 and became epidemic till 2004 infecting over 8000 people and causing death of 774 people from 29 different countries (Businessinsider, 2020). Since 2002, the discovery of a number of SARS-CoVs has been continued from their natural reservoir host, bats. Like SARS-CoVs, MERS-CoV caused a severe respiratory syndrome in humans in 2012 in Middle East (De Groot et al., 2013). Lastly, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, a member of beta-coronaviruses, has started in China from December 2019 causing 198 confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20, 2020 (WHO, 2020k). In terms of risk factor, SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from SARS, MERS, and influenza (Yin and Wunderink, 2018). According to epidemiologists, the epidemic infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 becomes a pandemic due to its new strains and current spreading from continents to continents (Gorbalenya et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020b).",

However, the bodies of animals are considered to be the common origin for about 60% of newly emerging and re-emerging pathogens (CDC, 2020c). Recently, it has been reported that most alpha- and beta-CoVs originates from bats (Woo et al., 2012; Woo et al., 2006). Furthermore, several virologic and genetic studies indicated that the origin of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and MERS-CoV (Ithete et al., 2013) is supposed to be bats, whereas the intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans are palm civets and dromedary camels respectively. The first discovered place of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported as a wet market named Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020), where there is a chance of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans. Like SARS, SARS-CoV-2 has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses suggesting its emergence from a bat-borne virus (Benvenuto et al., 2020; N. Chen et al., 2020; Perlman, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). Therefore, the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is bats as recommended by WHO (WHO, 2020r). In addition, pangolin is assumed to be involved as an intermediate animal reservoir for the transmission of novel virus to humans causing COVID-19 (C, 2020; WHO, 2020k).",

Due to this fact, the local and systemic antiviral defense mechanisms can be weakened (Moriyama et al., 2020). However, the relation between the mechanisms of respiratory viral infections and the seasonal environmental factors has been causing controversy for many years (Moriyama et al., 2020). These all issues have been discussed by Moriyama et al. (2020), who focused on the linking evidence of outdoor and indoor climates with the seasonality of respiratory viral infections. Therefore, it was suggested that the transmission rate and stability of novel coronavirus (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) can be varied with different environmental parameters, i.e., temperature, humidity, sunlight etc. (Kuiken et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Peiris et al., 2003). However, there is no strong evidence about decreased transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 in temperate regions like African countries (Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2020).",

It has been reported that COVID-19 has been primarily transmitted from symptomatic people by direct contact or close contact through respiratory droplets, or by indirect contact with contaminated objects and surfaces (Burke et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Jiaye et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020; WHO, 2020c). A small number of case reports and studies have been found for pre-symptomatic transmission through contact tracing efforts and enhanced investigation of clusters of confirmed cases (R. Huang et al., 2020; W.E. Wei et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; Zhen-Dong et al., 2020). Where the contact tracing is a process of identifying persons who may have come in contact with an COVID-19 infected person and subsequent collection of further information about these contacts (Wikipedia, 2020a). To April 20, 2020, there has been no documented asymptomatic transmission (WHO, 2020c). However, this does not mean zero possibility of asymptomatic transmission.",

If the host is an asymptomatic carrier, there is no signs or symptoms of infection. In the symptomatic case, flu-like symptoms will be developed (N. Chen et al., 2020; MT, 2020). Table 2\nsummarizes the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. According to previous studies, mild symptoms are observed in most cases, whereas complicated and very-complicated symptoms are reported for approximately 14% and 5% respectively (NCPERE, 2020; WHO, 2020f). The complicated symptoms include sepsis and septic shock, multi organ failure, including acute kidney injury, and cardiac injury (WHO, 2020f). COVID-19 cases for children are usually less severe than that for adults while co-infection has been observed for children (Cai et al., 2020; WHO, 2020f; Xia et al., 2020). COVID-19 cases for infants are reported to be few with mild illness (M. Wei et al., 2020). It should be noted that COVID-19 symptoms for pregnant and non-pregnant women are almost identical (WHO, 2020f). Moreover, if mild or emergency symptoms of COVID-19 are present, immediate medical attention is advised (CDC, 2020d).",

The infection may proceed in the following way (Letko et al., 2020):I.First, the virus particle uses its special surface, glycoprotein (spike) to connect to ACE2 of the lungs and thus enters the host cell (Fig. 5a).II.The virus particle is then uncoated, and its RNA genome enters the cell cytoplasm and attach to the host cell's ribosome by its 5\u2032 methylated cap and 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail. The host ribosome forms a long polyprotein by translating the virus genome and the polyprotein is subsequently cleaved into multiple nonstructural proteins. (Fig. 5b).III.Then the nonstructural proteins coalesce and form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) named RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RdRp synthesizes positive-sense genomic RNA as progeny viruses by replication and positive-sense sub genomic RNA as gene transcripts or messenger RNA (mRNA) by transcription.IV.The host's ribosomes translate the mRNAs into the structural proteins and a number of accessory proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Then the viral structural proteins (S, E, and M) are combined with nucleocapsid by protein-protein interactions. Finally, the progeny viruses are then released from the host cell.\n",

During this incubation period, an organism can be multiplied and reach a threshold limit, which is necessary to produce symptoms in the host (Wikipedia, 2020b). In order to determine the most likely exposure time for an outbreak of a typical infectious disease, it is very important to know the average as well as range of incubation period (CDC, 2020l). Currently, the incubation period of novel coronavirus is generally between two and fourteen days (Lombardi et al., 2020), with an average of five days (CDC, 2020k). Lauer et al. (2020) estimated the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 for 181 confirmed cases outside Hubei province, China. It was monitored that >97% of people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were showing symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure whereas the average incubation period was approximately 5 days, which is as similar as SARS. However, longer monitoring periods are suggested to be justified in extreme cases. Therefore, if a person travelled to an ongoing COVID-19 infected area within the previous 14 days, is at high risk and must follow quarantine rules (CDC, 2020c; Jiaye et al., 2020).",

This test can be performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. Real-time RT-PCR is a popular technique in molecular biology (Freeman et al., 1999) for monitoring the amplification of a targeted DNA molecule in real time. Whereas RT-PCR combines reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and PCR amplification of the DNA followed by readout using fluorescence (Bustin et al., 2009). The test is done by collecting respiratory or blood samples. The respiratory samples are obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab (Fig. 6\n). The nasopharyngeal swab is a collection method of clinical test sample of nasopharyngeal secretions from the back of the nose and posterior pharynx (WHO, 2020g). The swab used for nasopharyngeal collection is a narrow stick made of a short plastic rod that is covered, at one tip, with adsorbing material such as sterile Dacron or rayon and ensuring viral transport media (WHO, 2020a). The test results are generally available within a few hours to two days. Blood samples can be collected two times in two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value (CDC, 2020j). It is a matter of hope that the country-based genetic sequences of RNA strains of the novel coronavirus have already been isolated and reported (Sah et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020).",

It is well known that the primary and most effective PI of any infectious disease is vaccination (NIAID, 2016; Orenstein et al., 1985). A vaccine typically contains an agent of the disease-causing microorganism in its weakened or killed forms (Wikipedia, 2020c). After getting vaccination, the antigenic agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent of the respective disease as a threat and subsequently destroys it. Vaccines for coronaviruses are mostly based on targeting the main antigenic component of the virus, which is S protein. Several strategies have been used that encode the S protein. The most popular strategies are DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, and attenuated recombinant viruses (ClinicalTrials, 2019; M., 2019). Recently, China and Australia have successfully grown 2019-nCoV to help develop new strategies to combat the pathogen (J., 2020). According to the prior studies related to coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, a genetic platform called mRNA-1273 (messenger RNA) was used to develop the investigational vaccine and examined in human on trial basis (NIAID, 2020). However, there has not yet been approved vaccine and anti-viral medications for SARS-CoV-2 (Grenfell, 2020; Spinney, 2020). This may be because it is highly unlikely that a well-matched vaccine will be available when a pandemic begins unless a vaccine with broad cross-protection is developed (CDC, 2007).b.Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs):\n",

As a result, the number of infected persons requiring hospitalization may go beyond the capacity of a nation's health-care facilities. On the other hand, protective measures can lower the epidemic peak of COVID-19 cases to the extent possible (CDC, 2007). Therefore, it is highly appreciated to apply protective measures like NPI during this pandemic until the epidemic peak goes down.

The recommended time for hand washing along with soap and water is at least 20 s (CDC, 2020i). When soap and water are not readily available outside, especially in a public place, hand sanitizer is used as an alternative to soap (CDC, 2020i). Because alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can disinfect hands by taking a little amount on hand and rubbing them until getting dry (CDC, 2020i).

Among all of these measures, social or physical distancing is intended to slow the spread of disease in a community or country effectively, by minimizing close contact between individuals (approximately 2 m), remaining out of crowded public places, avoiding mass gatherings and working from home (CDC, 2020i). During the outbreaks like COVID-19, people sometimes use the terms quarantine and isolation interchangeably, where there is an important distinction between quarantine and isolation (CDC, 2020i). For example, when there is a possibility of exposure of people to COVID-19, they are put in quarantine to help stopping the spread of the disease. On the contrary, the confirmed COVID-19 patients are put into isolation by completely separating them from others to stop the spreading of the disease into others.",

It is a matter of warning about the effects of COVID-19 pandemic spreading to Africa due to the challenging facts (Ahmed, 2020; Maclean, 2020) availed in that region for a long time like inadequate healthcare systems (lack of equipment, lack of funding, insufficient training of healthcare workers, and inefficient data transmission); challenging hand washing, physical distancing as well as lockdowns; prevalence of ongoing diseases (BBC, 2020b) such as malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, and cholera. Following these facts, many countries on the African continent have already been provided laboratory set up facilities for COVID-19 testing by WHO (Braubien, 2020) along with many preventive measures, i.e., travel restrictions, flight cancellations, event cancellations, school closures, and border closures.",

(2020) reviewed the existing global data sources and global statistics published by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). According to the statistical data of ECDC, Fig. 10\nwas revised in this study for showing the speed of increasing the number of cases in each country since the 100th confirmed cases (from January 22 to April 20, 2020) (Roser et al., 2020). The straight grey lines in Fig. 10 indicate trajectories for a doubling time of 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, and 10 days, where the \u201ctrajectory\u201d is the standard starting place for each line on the graph. According to Fig. 10, if a country's line is higher than those lines, then its number of cases is doubling faster than that (Roser et al., 2020). For example, the trajectory of China had a particular faster rise than other countries like Singapore and Japan. Whereas China and South Korea have showed rapid initial rise. However, this has become plateau after implementing preventive measures and new daily confirmed deaths have been declined. Thus, this graph would be useful to know whether cases in a country now would grow faster, slower, at the same speed as of other countries when it had a similar number.",

It should be noted that CFR is a poor metric to understand the mortality risk for relatively small number of confirmed cases. The major contributing factors for high fatality of COVID-19 cases across the whole world may be higher population density or higher rate of international travel. Additionally, a recent study found that coronavirus mortality rates are higher in countries, i.e., Italy, Spain, France, and Germany where the level of air pollutant like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is high (Ogen, 2020).

There are post-haste priorities during this outbreak suggested by Experts of CDC (CDC, 2020b):1.Vaccine development: As vaccines can dramatically slow the spread of a disease, it should be the first priority. However, it will take at least a year to develop the vaccine for SAR-CoV-2.2.Genome sequence: The identification of genome sequence for RNA strains of SAR-CoV-2 can be implemented in the laboratories across the world to develop PCR-based tests independently in order to analyze infection caused by the virus.3.Finding treatments: Research and tests of possible antiviral medications should be performed for treatment options.4.Expansion of diagnostic capacity: In order to identify the COVID-19 cases quickly, rapid diagnostic kits should be developed.5.Boosting of hospital readiness: The health facilities, i.e., infection control procedures, training of health workers, available stock of gowns, and gloves should be enriched.6.Communication: All features related to COVID-19 pandemic must be shared clearly with the public, and resisted the temptation to withhold bad news.\n",

In this ongoing situation, there may be a possibility of disruption to critical supply markets, i.e., surgical masks, N95 masks, gloves, goggles, and face shields, where demand outpaces global supply. Furthermore, the COVID-19's increased demand for medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and reagents, could create opportunities for ill-intended persons to distribute falsified medical products (WHO, 2020e). As a result, there are growing number of falsified medical products available that claim to prevent, detect, treat, or cure COVID-19. Due diligence is required from consumers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities in the procurement, use and administration of medical products, in particular those affected by the current crisis of, or related to, COVID-19 (WHO, 2020e). As no pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020p), doctors should not prescribe medications that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered \u201coff-label\u201d use (WHO, 2020p). The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. Unnecessary stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided. Besides, all hospitals of every continent should be prepared during this outbreak for identifying and managing COVID-19 patients (Jansson et al., 2020).",

Almost all the cities of affected countries are seemed to be turn into ghost-cities. Small island nations, which are significantly dependent on tourism, have now their hotels customer-less and beaches without people (UNDP, 2020a). Factories are closing and thus people are losing their jobs as well as income every day. The International Labour Organization estimates that 25 million jobs could be lost, which could lose at least US$220 billion in income in developing countries (ILO, 2020). Hence, the living conditions in the world has been turning into hostile environment for human being. Countries already in crisis because of conflicts, natural disasters, and climate change are most at risk (Maxmen, 2020). Furthermore, countries with fragile institutions and weak health systems, huge numbers of people could die in the short term, (Maxmen, 2020) including many of the millions of vulnerable people living in unruly and under-resourced refugee camps (Berglof, 2020). One of the most stressful situations is the unpredictability of the situation and the uncertainty of when to control the disease and the seriousness of the risk (Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020). As a result, factors like uncertain future, travel bans, social distancing, home quarantine, possibility of COVID-19 infections, and isolation of patients etc. during the current outbreak has caused public panic and mental health stress (Bao et al., 2020). Moreover, it is realizable from the current ongoing situation that the current COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest challenge we have faced since World War II (Two). As confirmed COVID-19 cases are increasing every day in many countries, it has become much more than a global health crisis, which is thus creating a global stress with devastating mental, social, economic, and political crises while reversing development gains achieved over the last 20 years.",

The national and international public and private organizations must join the current COVID-19 fight in order to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and build resilience to crises and shocks (Gon\u00e7alves-S\u00e1, 2020). Already, several international organizations have started to support the COVID-19 affected countries. For example, WHO encourages the sharing of data for better understanding to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, and to develop countermeasures (WHO, 1948). In addition, WHO Operation Support and Logistics (OSL) continues to monitor critical markets and in partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (WHO, 2020c). Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL has shipped >8,00,000 surgical masks, 54,000 N95 masks, 8,73,000 gloves, 15,000 goggles and 24,000 face shields to 75 countries and also COVID-19 testing kits to 126 countries (WHO, 2020c). United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been supporting countries since the very early stages of this crisis, donating more than two million surgical masks and providing life supporting medical equipment, such as X-ray machines, infrared thermometers, infusion pumps, protective suits, gloves, and hand sanitizer (UNDP, 2020a). UNDP is also supporting health systems in countries including Bosnia, Herzegovina, Djibouti, El Salvador, Eritrea, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Nigeria, Paraguay, Panama and Ukraine (UNDP, 2020a). Additionally, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has launched a US$2 billion global humanitarian response plan in the most vulnerable (UNDP, 2020b). The World Bank, which has a long record of supporting health care, has announced an initial package of up to $12 billion in immediate support to affected countries (WorldBank, 2020).",

An effective global strategy must support the effort to develop and distribute a vaccine. For starters like COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination could be the primary preventive measure of the disease (Berglof, 2020). However, there is no guarantee that other novel virus will not emerge in future, for which millions may die before developing respective vaccines (Berglof, 2020; UNDP, 2020a). Therefore, the use of research-based evidence (Nature, 2020a; Yang and Wang, 2020) and coping with steep learning curves may strengthen the weakest links in an individual hospital, a local community, a country, or the world during this current pandemic (Berglof, 2020). At the same time, the weak health-care systems must be shored up for the worst-case scenario. Lastly, fast and large-scale efforts must be designed as well as considered to handle not only the imminent flood of cases but also pandemic recurring and future waves of similar viruses (Berglof, 2020). Because, weaker health education can be as damaging as the virus itself and thereby, improved health education is one of the important tools to fight the unknown pathogens like novel viruses. Assuming this view, the Director-General of WHO has stated that the world is fighting an epidemic as well as infodemic\u201d (WHO, 2020h).",
