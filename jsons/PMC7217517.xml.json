Originally studied in the context of infectious diseases [1\u20134], contagion has now been used as a metaphor for diverse processes that spread by contact between neighbors. Examples include the spread of fads and fashions [5,6], scientific ideas [7], bank failures [8\u201312], computer viruses [13], gossip [14], rumors [15,16], and yawning [17]. Closely related phenomena arise in probability theory and statistical physics in the setting of first-passage percolation [18,19], and in evolutionary dynamics in connection with the spread of mutations through a resident population [20\u201324]. We use the language of contagion throughout, but bear in mind that everything could be reformulated in the language of the other fields mentioned above.",

If the first cell is mutated and its neighbor is normal, the mutated cell (which is assumed to reproduce much faster than its normal neighbor) makes a copy of itself that replaces the normal cell. In effect, the mutation has spread; it behaves as if it were an infection.

It is conceptually related to the fixation time in population genetics, defined as the time for a fitter mutant to sweep through a resident population. It is also reminiscent of the incubation period of an infectious disease, defined as the time lag between exposure to the pathogen and the appearance of symptoms; this lag presumably reflects the time needed for infection to sweep through a large fraction of the resident healthy cells.",

Similarly we expect a dramatic slowing down and enhancement of fluctuations in the endgame.

If you want to collect N distinct coupons, and at each time step you are given one coupon at random (with replacement), what is the distribution of the time required to collect all the coupons? Like the endgame of the infection process, the coupon collection process slows down and suffers large fluctuations when almost all the coupons are in hand and one is waiting in exasperation for that last coupon. Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi proved that for large N, the distribution of waiting times for the coupon collection problem approaches a Gumbel distribution [28]. This type of distribution is right skewed and is one of the three universal extreme value distributions [29,30].",

For d-dimensional cubic lattices, the dependence on d is intriguing: we find that T is normally distributed for d=1 and d=2, then becomes skewed for d\u22653 and approaches the convolution of two Gumbel distributions as d approaches infinity. We conclude by discussing the many simplifications in our model, with the aim of showing how the model relates to more realistic models. We also discuss the possible relevance of our results to fixation times in evolutionary dynamics, population genetics, and cancer biology, and to the longstanding (yet theoretically unexplained) clinical observation that incubation periods for infectious diseases frequently have right-skewed distributions.",

The fixation time is defined as the time required for a fitter mutant (think of a precancerous cell in a tissue) to sweep through a population of less fit wild-type individuals (normal cells). Initially, a single mutant is introduced at a random node of the network. At each time step, one individual is randomly chosen to reproduce. With probability proportional to its fitness, it gives birth to one offspring, and one of its network neighbors is randomly chosen to die and be replaced by that offspring. The natural questions are as follows: What is the probability that the lineage of the mutant will eventually take over the whole network? And if it does, how long does it take for this fixation to occur?",

Using Markov chains, Hindersin and colleagues provided exact calculations of the fixation probability and average fixation times for a wide family of graphs, as well as an investigation of the dependence on microscopic dynamics [22,23,47,48]. A challenge for this approach is that the size of the state space becomes intractable quickly: even with sparse matrix methods, it grows like N2N\n[47]. For networks of size N<23, their computations showed that the distributions of mutant fixation times were skewed to the right, much like the Gumbel distributions, convolutions of Gumbel distributions, and intermediate distributions found analytically and discussed here in Secs.

While heterogeneous networks are outside the scope of this work, our initial results suggest that the takeover times there too are distributed in a right-skewed fashion resembling a Gumbel distribution (see Appendix I). In the future, we hope to link our model to more concrete real-world phenomena and experimental data, connecting our abstract \u201cstep-based\u201d takeover times with physically meaningful times on time scales appropriate for the situation in question.",
