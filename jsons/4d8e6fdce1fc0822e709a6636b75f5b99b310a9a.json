[6] [7] [8] [9] In addition, individuals with sarcopenia have higher insulin resistance and are at increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease than nonsarcopenic individuals.

Demographic and personal medical data were collected using standardized health questionnaires. The health interview was conducted by trained staff members, including physicians, medical technicians, and health interviewers. These data included reproductive factors (age at menarche, age at menopause, number of pregnancies, history of oral contraceptive [OC] use, and history of HT use), history of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking history (current or ex-), and physical activity (walk/moderate/high).

The number of pregnancies was lower in participants who received HT for 1 to 12 months than in participants who received no HT. History of OC use was significantly more frequent in participants with than without a history of HT use.
