            "text": "Tropical rain forests are complex systems with high diversity of tree species growing in three continents along the equator. However, large\u2010scale inventory networks across the tropics have shown that there are important intercontinental differences in rain forest tree communities. African tropical rain forests, for example, are less diverse in terms of tree species than Amazonian and South\u2010East Asian rain forests (Parmentier et al., 2007; Slik et al., 2015). In all these regions, however, lower diversity forests are found in the form of monodominant forest, where a single canopy species constitutes \u226560% of all canopy\u2010level trees (Connell & Lowman, 1989; Hart, 1985; Peh, Lewis, & Lloyd, 2011). Such monodominance in old\u2010growth forests can be caused by distinct edaphic conditions (Richards, 1996), for example, in water\u2010logged forest (Connell & Lowman, 1989; Richards, 1996) and low\u2010nutrient forests (McGuire, 2007). Another type of monodominance is related to the disturbance regime of the forest, with low disturbance rates favoring competitive exclusion (Connell & Lowman, 1989; Hart, Hart, & Murphy, 1989). Yet, monodominant forests can also present themselves in similar environmental conditions as their adjacent high\u2010diversity forest and are apparently not bound to major edaphic differences or recent disturbances. Research on mechanisms to explain monodominance has focused on traits of dominant species that provide a competitive advantage, including low leaf litter decomposition rates, high seedling shade tolerance, large seed size, and defense against herbivory (Hart et al., 1989; Torti, Coley, & Kursar, 2001). The best\u2010studied of these monodominant forests in Africa is that dominated by Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (De Wild.) J. Leonard from which naturally occurring monodominant patches are commonly found across central Africa, alongside forests with high species diversity (Fayolle et al., 2014; Hart, 1985; Peh, Sonk\u00e9, Lloyd, Quesada, & Lewis, 2011; Viennois, Barbier, Fabre, & Couteron, 2013). Some environmental differences between these monodominant forests and adjacent mixed forests have been described, although the presence of an environmental filter (i.e., ecological filters related to the abiotic environment selecting for species suitable for this environment; Keddy, 1992) for establishment of the monodominance is not always evident. For example, these forests are often found along rivers (Fayolle et al., 2014), although not exclusively (Hart et al., 1989). Additionally, Peh, Sonk\u00e9 et al. (2011) did not find evidence for differences in soil characteristics between this monodominant forest and the adjacent mixed forest, similar to findings of Hart (1985) and Conway (1992), while Torti et al. (2001) did report lower availability of nitrogen in the monodominant forest. Moreover, how the presence of this monodominance and its according environmental conditions impacts the overall tree community, species composition, and richness is not well understood. Variable species diversity of monodominant forests compared to the adjacent mixed forest has been reported, with both similar (Connell & Lowman, 1989; Makana, Terese, Hibbs, & Condit, 2004) and lower species diversity (Djuikouo, Sonk\u00e9, Doucet, Nguembou, & Lewis, 2010; Hart et al., 1989; Peh, 2009). Nevertheless, low species diversity does not necessarily indicate an equivalently low functional diversity in the community. Functional diversity, defined as the value, range, and distribution of functional traits in a given ecosystem (D\u00edaz et al., 2007), namely also depends on variability of trait values of all species present, both within and between species, and on the extent of overlap of functional niches. Moreover, this distribution of trait values of all individuals in a community depends on the balance between processes related to environmental filtering and those leading to niche differentiation between individuals (Harper, 1977; MacArthur & Levins, 1967).",

A dataset of 13 leaf and wood traits was used focusing on traits with a clear link to resource acquisition, growth, nutrient cycling, and decomposition, covering 95% (basal area weighted) of all species present in the plots. Plant traits are scaled up from individuals to community\u2010level trait distributions as a means to investigate ecosystem functioning and community assembly through environmental filtering (e.g., Fayolle et al., 2012; Fortunel, Paine, Fine, Kraft, & Baraloto, 2014; Laughlin, Ful\u00e9, Huffman, Crouse, & Lalibert\u00e9, 2011). We hypothesize (Hypothesis I) that G. dewevrei monodominant forests hold a lower functional diversity than the mixed forest related to the existence of environmental filtering. Even though the dominance of G. dewevrei could not be linked to edaphic controls in previous studies, recent studies indicate that (1) G. dewevrei monodominant forests most commonly occur along rivers and forest streams (Fayolle et al., 2014) and (2) dominant species can modify soil conditions (Brookshire & Thomas, 2013) which in turn can act as an environmental filter. Furthermore, we hypothesize (Hypothesis II) that other species present in this monodominant forest contain (an ensemble of) traits similar to those of G. dewevrei as they encounter the same environmental filtering and that species that do not possess these traits will be confined to the mixed forest.",

As measured in the Yangambi reserve, the region receives an annual precipitation of 1839.5 \u00b1 205.7 mm (1980\u20132012) with an average dry season length of 3.3 \u00b1 1.3 months with monthly precipitation lower than 100 mm, during December\u2013February.

J. Leonard (Table 1). Monodominant forest was found near forest streams, while mixed forest was found covering the entire reserve. Permanent sampling plots of the mixed forest plots were located within a radius of 2 km of the monodominant forest plots. The permanent plot setup in Yangambi does not contain mixed forest plots near forest streams. Within all plots, all trees with a DBH \u2265 10 cm have been measured for DBH and identified to species level. For each taxon, at least one herbarium specimen and one silica gel dried leaf sample were collected. Vouchers were deposited in the Herbarium Yangambi (DRC) and in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden Meise (Belgium). In order to verify field identifications, vouchers were compared with reference specimens kept by the Botanic Garden Meise for both morphologic and genetic characteristics (barcodes generated using rbcL and matK sequences as recommended by the CBOL Plant Working Group 2009).",

These 10 sampling locations were spatially well distributed following an \u201cS\u201d curve across each 1\u2010ha plot. All samples were oven\u2010dried (50\u00b0C), and the following parameters have been measured on plot\u2010level composite soil samples per depth increment: bulk density, carbon and nitrogen content, isotopic composition of carbon (\u03b413C) and nitrogen (\u03b415N), and bioavailable phosphorus. For two plots per forest type, more detailed soil measurements have been made, namely soil texture, pHCaCl2, potential cation exchange capacity (CECpot), and base saturation. C and N content and isotopic compositions were analyzed using an elemental analyzer (ANCA\u2010SL, SerCon, Crewe, UK) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (20\u201020, SerCon, Crewe, UK) (EA\u2010IRMS). Bulk density was determined on composites of 10 samples per plot using Kopecky cylinders. Soil texture was determined by means of the percentage of sand, silt, and clay. All analyses were performed on air\u2010dried fine soil fractions (<2 mm). The sand fraction (>63 \u03bcm) was separated by wet sieving; the silt and clay fractions were determined by the K\u00f6hn pipette method after dispersion with sodium hexametaphosphate (Pansu & Gautheyrou, 2006). Soil pHCaCl2 was determined potentiometrically in 25 ml 0.01 M CaCl2 (1:2.5 soil:solution ratio) with a glass electrode using a portable multiparameter Meter HI9828 (Hanna Instruments US Inc., USA). CECpot was determined by quantifying NH4+ exchanged with 2 M KCl after saturating cation exchange sites with ammonium acetate buffered at pH 7.0 and measured with ICP\u2010MS. Exchangeable Al was extracted by 1 M KCl solution and determined colorimetrically. Resin\u2010extractable P was determined using resin\u2010impregnated membrane strips (Sharpley, 2009).",

Fresh weight of the leaf samples was measured as a composite sample, and high\u2010resolution images were taken to determine leaf area, while leaves were flattened between transparent Plexiglas. Leaf surface is determined by analyzing these images using ImageJ software (from the US National Institutes of Health; https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Leaves were subsequently dried at 60\u00b0C for 72 h, or until no more weight change occurred, and dry mass was determined. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC, leaf dry weight divided by fresh weight) and specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area divided by dry weight) were determined. Next, chemical analysis of the leaves was performed at the Isotope Bioscience Laboratory (Ghent University, Belgium). Composite leaf samples were ground to fine powder using a ball mill (ZM200; Retsch, Germany). Mass\u2010based leaf carbon content (LCC) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and the isotopic composition of carbon (\u03b413C) and nitrogen (\u03b415N) were determined using an elemental analyzer (ANCA\u2010SL; SerCon, Crewe, UK) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (20\u201020; SerCon, Crewe, UK) (EA\u2010IRMS). Isotope ratios were expressed in delta notation relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard for \u03b413C and atmospheric air for \u03b415N. Leaf phosphorus content (LPC) and isotopic composition of oxygen (\u03b418O) were determined on a subset of samples, with priority to species with more replicates. Samples were retained if more than three individuals from a species were measured within a forest type, of which three to five individuals were randomly selected for analysis. In total, 358 individuals covering 76 species were measured for LPC and \u03b418O. For LPC determination, samples were prepared using the Chapman & Pratt (1961) procedure with some slight modifications and measured using the auto analyzer method, No.G\u2010103\u201093 Rev.2 (Multitest MT7/MT8). \u03b418O is analyzed using a high\u2010temperature furnace interfaced with an EA\u2010IRMS (20\u201020, SerCon, Crewe, UK). \u03b418O is expressed relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW2) standard.",

Each metric is expressed in effective number of species in order to estimate \u201ctrue\u201d biodiversity (Jost, 2006). Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity index, while raw indices do not (Jost, 2006). As species richness depends on the number of individuals sampled, irrespective of plot size, samples were standardized for their completeness. The sample completeness is the proportion of the total number of individuals in a community that belong to the species represented in the sample and can be estimated based on the sampling curves (Chao & Jost, 2012). Indices and sample completeness are calculated on a plot level (1 ha) using the functions provided in the package iNEXT (Hsieh, Ma, & Chao, 2013) in R 2.13.1 (CRAN core development team).",

Functional richness is defined as the amount of niche space filled by species in the community, thus describing trait dissimilarity. Functional richness is measured for each plot as the convex hull volume encompassing all traits. Functional evenness is the evenness of abundance distribution in filled niche space. Functional divergence is the degree to which abundance distribution in niche space maximizes divergence in functional characters within the community. Functional divergence is calculated relative to the centroid per plot. All indices are calculated using the R package FD (Lalibert\u00e9, Legendre, & Shipley, 2014).",

We acknowledge that the uniform distribution is not optimal to represent intraspecific trait variability, although we believe this representation better reflects the community trait assembly than using a species\u2010specific mean. Accordingly, with all individual trees being assigned a trait value, species abundance is taken into account for the calculation of CWM. Note that the CWM for the monodominant forest is highly influenced by the dominant species G. dewevrei representing 24.2% of all individuals in this community and 65.3% of the basal area.",

Secondly, lower functional richness is found in the monodominant forest, indicating a narrower functional niche space compared to the adjacent mixed forest (Mason et al., 2005; Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2008). Furthermore, the similarity in functional evenness and divergence between the two forest types shows that, even within the reduced niche space in the monodominant forests, a similar niche differentiation and trait distribution occur compared to the adjacent mixed forest (Paine, Baraloto, Chave, & Herault, 2011; Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2008). These indices thus show that the monodominant forest mainly differs from the adjacent mixed forest in the narrower range of its niche space, where a lower species diversity is present, which could be the result of environmental filtering (Mason et al., 2005; Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2008).",

            "text": "First, monodominant G. dewevrei forests are often found to be sparsely distributed along rivers (Fayolle et al., 2014), which is also the case in our study area. Accordingly, G. dewevrei possesses an ensemble of traits related to water use and transport that could be favorable in this environment. Namely, its vascular traits with high VDm combined with low VD are not general for a late successional tropical species. These wide vessels have the advantage of a greater water transport capacity or hydraulic efficiency (Tyree & Zimmermann, 2002), but may also be more vulnerable to drought\u2010induced cavitation (Tyree & Sperry, 1989) although susceptibility to cavitation would need to be confirmed by pit membrane structure (Hacke & Sperry, 2001). Additionally, with \u03b413C being a proxy of the intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE; the ratio of photosynthetic carbon fixation to stomatal conductance; Dawson, Mambelli, Plamboeck, Templer, & Tu, 2002; Farquhar, Ehleringer, & Hubick, 1989) and \u03b418O providing a time\u2010integrated measure of stomatal conductance (Barbour, 2007; Farquhar, Cernusak, & Barnes, 2007; Hasselquist, Allen, & Santiago, 2010), simultaneous measurements of \u03b413C and \u03b418O indicate that G. dewevrei shows low WUE combined with a high stomatal conductance compared to other species in the community. This high stomatal conductance suggests little need for water loss regulation for G. dewevrei in this environment, and the large vessel size and low WUE indicate a limited drought resistance of G. dewevrei. This low drought resistance and small potential for water regulation possibly explain the presence of G. dewevrei near the rivers, where water tables are expected to be shallow. However, it should be noted that no information is available for our sites on the water status and year\u2010round averages and extremes in soil gravimetric water contents. Yet, G. dewevrei\u2010dominated forests do not always occur along rivers and forest streams. The traits described here for G. dewevrei reflect a known trade\u2010off with water transport capacity positively related to photosynthetic potential and carbon assimilation rates (Santiago et al., 2004) versus inhibited water conservation. As an upper canopy species, G. dewevrei might benefit more from increased potential carbon gain as opposed to safeguarding water conservation. In consequence, the distribution of G. dewevrei can be generally related to environments with sufficient water availability, and is not solely constrained to riverine locations.",

            "text": "Secondly, indications are found of environmental filtering through a reduction in N and P soil availability in the monodominant forest. We speculate that this difference with mixed forests is possibly caused by differences in mycorrhizal associations. Studies comparing monodominant and adjacent mixed forests often cannot identify differences in soil characteristics (Conway, 1992; Hart, 1985; Peh, Sonk\u00e9 et al., 2011; although see Torti et al., 2001). However, in our study area, lower bioavailable P concentrations were found in the 0\u201330 cm depth layer of the monodominant forest. Furthermore, we argue that based on leaf nutrient traits, two indications for N and P limitations can be found in our investigated forest systems. First, G. dewevrei was found to be significantly depleted in foliar \u03b415N indicating its association with ectomycorrhizal fungi (Craine et al., 2009; Hobbie & H\u00f6gberg, 2012), confirming what has previously been reported for G. dewevrei (Onguene & Kuyper, 2001; Torti & Coley, 1999). Ectomycorrhizal fungi could affect the availability of inorganic N and possibly P present in soil (Corrales, Mangan, Turner, & Dalling, 2016). In our study, no difference was found in soil N between mixed and monodominant forest. However, only total N (including organic and inorganic N) has been measured (as is the case in Conway, 1992; Hart, 1985; Peh, Sonk\u00e9 et al., 2011) which might not represent the actual N available for plants. A fraction of total N could be sequestered in the ectomycorrhizal fungal biomass. In return, in the mixed forest, N and P limitations might be less as most tropical trees form arbuscular mycorrhizal associations (Corrales et al., 2016) that contribute to a smaller extent to N limitations (Smith & Read, 2008; although see Hodge & Fitter, 2010). Accordingly (and secondly), reduced leaf N and P contents are found at the community level for the monodominant forest, although these CWMs are highly influenced by G. dewevrei itself. Lower LNC values are, however, found for both the unique and shared species in the monodominant forest compared to the CWM of the mixed forest, as are the LPC values of the shared species in the monodominant forests. These reduced foliar N and P contents might indicate combined N and P limitations, possibly a direct influence of the immobilization of N and P by ectomycorrhizal fungi as discussed above. Furthermore, this alteration in N and P availability might be induced by the long\u2010term dominance of G. dewevrei itself, with slow\u2010decomposing leaf litter generated by the dominant G. dewevrei (i.e., low SLA, high LDMC, high C:N) reinforcing low nutrient turnover rates and low N and P availability (Brookshire & Thomas, 2013; Menge, 2011). Moreover, the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi possibly suppresses decomposition rates even further due to competition with saprotrophic fungi (Fernandez & Kennedy, 2016). The alteration of the local environment resulting from the dominance of G. dewevrei has been suggested to be a monodominance\u2010enhancing mechanism (Peh, Lewis et al., 2011; Torti et al., 2001). G. dewevrei can namely thrive in this nutrient\u2010limited environment with its slow growth rates (deducted from its dense wood and thus high construction cost; Enquist, West, Charnov, & Brown, 1999) and high nutrient use efficiency (Peh, Lewis et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The environmental filtering encountered in the monodominant forest can also affect the subordinate species composition, namely by altering the probabilities of specific traits. For example, Peh et al. (2014) showed that species with low light requirement and high WD have a greater chance of establishing in the monodominant forest, where light levels are low under the dense canopy. Within our study area, this could not be confirmed with the WD of species uniquely found in the mixed forest being similar to those that did occur in the monodominant forest. However, overall community differences in traits\u2014for the different species groups\u2014have been found between the monodominant and the mixed forest, namely for nutrient contents, WUE traits, and SLA. The lower values of nutrient contents of all species within this monodominant tropical tree community could be a direct result of the altered N and P availability in this environment (Brookshire & Thomas, 2013; Peh, Lewis et al., 2011). Additionally, the species established in the monodominant forest show a lower mean SLA compared to the species in the mixed forest. These leaves with low SLA, high tissue density (see LDMC), and low nutrient concentrations (both N and P) generally have lower photosynthetic rates but a longer life span (Reich, Walters, Tjoelker, Vanderklein, & Bushena, 1998; Wright & Westoby, 2002). The longer leaf life span could provide advantages for species under the closed canopy of G. dewevrei, susceptible to the limited N availability, with an increased return of investment. Additionally, these leaf traits contribute to defend against herbivores and pathogens (Hanley, Lamont, Fairbanks, & Rafferty, 2007) and thus have higher survival rates (Poorter, Bongers, Sterck, & W\u00f6ll, 2003).",

We found that species in the mixed forest that have a high WUE (high \u03b413C) combined with a reduced stomatal conductance (high \u03b418O; Farquhar et al., 1989) did not establish in the monodominant forest. Species with a low WUE that keep their stomata open, thus reducing their stomatal resistance, could have a higher resource use efficiency for other limiting resources (e.g., light or nutrient limitations) enabling them to compete, or keep up, with the monodominant species. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis, because the isotopic compositions can only be used as proxies of WUE.",

First, the common location of G. dewevrei forests near forest rivers has been linked to its functional traits related to water use and transport. Secondly, collected trait data point toward a reduction in N and P availability in soils of the monodominant forest, possibly caused by ectomycorrhizal associations with G. dewevrei. Additionally, as proposed in Hypothesis II, a pattern between the trait ensemble of the monodominant G. dewevrei and the subordinate species that co\u2010occur with it in the same plots could be observed. This pattern was significantly different for species that only occur at the investigated mixed forest plots.
