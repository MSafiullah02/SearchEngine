For example, young antelopes born outside will be chased in the beginning of their lives by curious zebras, leading to death or a fatal myopathy, as has also been seen in young or newborn giraffes1 and antelopes. Play of young animals may not be understood by other species (Fig. 4-5\n). Pinioned birds fly in unrecognizable ways in the eyes of other animals and may become victims of other birds or mammals. Another factor is that when animals are frightened because of thunder or other events, or when animals are chased by other animals because of unexpected or differing circumstances, fleeing against fences or walls may cause fatal trauma.",

Do not mix wildebeest with giraffes and preferably get rid of all sheep and goats in a zoo collection. Carrier species should at least not be in breeding situations in direct contact or close to susceptible species. There are examples of zookeepers owning sheep at home that transmitted the virus to giraffes, resulting in high mortality.7 It is questionable whether zookeepers should be allowed to take care of household sheep and goats at home.",

Preventive measures and monitoring on an annual basis are necessary to prevent infectious disease outbreaks and parasitologic overload. Some tools that may be used are the following:1Observation, common sense, knowledge gained by experience, and the use of as many academic information sources as possible are important tools for a zoo veterinarian. To observe and understand gathered knowledge is to learn to adjust and apply protocols to avoid problems. The European Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians (EAZWV)\u2014Infectious Diseases Working Group (IDWG) Transmissible Diseases Handbook\n2 is available at http://www.eaza.net and http://www.eazwv.org. It includes chapters on cleaning and disinfection, vaccination, postmortem procedures, blue tongue, tuberculosis, and European legislation. Various links to important associations and the OIE (Office International des Epizooties [World Animal Health Organisation]) may be found, along with a list of national and OIE laboratories. Fact sheets on diseases lists experts to contact when disease outbreaks occur.2Laboratory studies using feces, saliva, hair, soil, water, vectors, environment, plants, and postmortem samples and more invasive sampling for bacteriology, skin scraping, blood work, serology, and biopsy are diagnostic tools that provide information about whether diseases may affect other species in an exhibit.3In a preventive regimen, vaccination may be used against a variety of infections such as pseudotuberculosis caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, blue tongue virus (various serotypes), Q fever, avian influenza (H5N2), avipox, cowpox (e.g., in elephants), tetanus, other Clostridiae (cocktails), pasteurellosis, bordetellosis, canine distemper, parvovirosis, leptospirosis, rabies, feline panleucopenia, feline HV and calicivirus (feline rhinotracheitis), feline leukemia (FeLV), chlamydophila (cats), and dermatophytosis (ringworm). Many of these vaccines prevent diseases that may occur in different species, spread by animals directly or by humans by carrying them into exhibits. Vector control is an important tool to prevent diseases such as pseudotuberculosis, tularemia, pox in elephants, malaria, blue tongue virus, rabies, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis in callitrichids. In general, vectors capable of bringing pathogens into exhibits are numerous. Insects, rodents, free-flying birds, feral cats and dogs, foxes, and raccoons are known vectors; in addition, humans may transport pathogens into exhibits.6 Many great ape diseases are directly related to human-animal contacts and pathogens may be transported by humans from elsewhere in the zoo and/or imported from outside the zoo, as noted earlier. Of known infectious diseases, 70% are zoonotic.4Quarantine and pretransport measures such as deworming and pretransport diagnostics (e.g., serology, bacteriology, parasitology) are essential tools to prevent potential hazards when introductions are planned into mixed exhibits. Preshipment protocols are especially important for megavertebrates when quarantine is not easily performed.5Parasite control, pathology, and necropsy programs are essential preventive tools. The adequate administration of results may lead to proper and timely adjustments of preventive measures.6\n6Foot baths and other hygienic measurements as part of a well-controlled biosecurity protocol are tools that may be used not only when disease outbreaks occur.4, 6\n\n",
