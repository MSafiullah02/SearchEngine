            "text": "The most important aim of animal welfare is to reduce painful manipulations. IgY technology fulfils this requirement in that chicken Abs can be easily sampled by a non-invasive method based on the simple act of collecting eggs. IgY technology also offers outstanding economical advantages because hens cost less to keep than rabbits. Furthermore, the Ab production of a hen roughly corresponds to that of a large mammal, such as a sheep or goat. Indeed, an extraordinary amount of Ab can be produced from only one hen-approximately 17-35 g of total IgY/chicken/year-of which 1-10% can be expected to be antigen-specific. This huge quantity of available Abs opens the door for new fields of IgY applications, such as immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis for several viral and bacterial infections in veterinary and human medicine. In addition, IgY Abs have no cross reactivity with rheumatoid factors (Larsson et al. 1991) or human anti-mouse Ab (HAMA; Carlander et al. 1999) . IgY Abs are unable to activate the mammalian complement system (Larsson et al. 1992 ) and have no heteroagglutinins (Calzado et al. 2003) . Furthermore, several authors have reported that chickens often produce Abs against phylogenetical highly conserved mammalian proteins or peptides more efficiently than do rabbits (Karlsson et al. 2004) . As a consequence, a conserved antigen can remain \"masked\" to the rabbit immune system, and thus cause only a weak or a \"silent\" response. Furthermore, if chickens and rabbits are immunized with the same mammalian antigen, very often the chickens respond with an Ab specificity that can rarely be achieved in rabbits, as for instance, with the N-terminal collagen propeptide PIIINP (Gerl et al. 1996) , parathyroid-hormone-related protein (Rosol et al. 1993) , transforming growth factor \u03b23 (TGF-\u03b23; Danielpour and Roberts 1995) , and YKL-40 glycoprotein (De Ceuninck et al. 2001) .The advantages of using chicken Abs have been recognized by many authors (for example L\u00f6sch et al. 1986; Carlander 2002; Narat 2003; Karlsson et al. 2004 ).",

            "text": "Powdered whole eggs or yolks have been used in veterinary medicine as an inexpensive IgY source for the treatment of enteric diseases. The most famous example of a successful therapeutic/prophylactic use of IgY is the treatment of calves and piglets with specific Abs against Escherichia coli (K88, K99, 987P), rotaviruses, and coronavirus (for review see Kovacs-Nolan 2002 and Mine 2004) . Studies using both animal models and trials in field herds have been carried out. The groups of Yolken (Yolken et al. 1988 ), L\u00f6sch (Wiedemann et al. 1991 ), Erhard (Erhard et al. 1996) , and Kuroki (Kuroki et al. 1997) have performed the studies mostly on the practical use of IgY (see also Bilbao et al. 2006 and Terzolo et al. 2003) . These studies confirmed that the treatment of diarrhea in calves and piglets with specific egg yolk Abs has achieved significant prophylactic and therapeutic benefits. Pokorova et al. (2000) administered IgY to protect dogs against canine parvovirus, and supposed that the protection was due to interactions between IgY and viral surface components. Sunwoo et al. (2002) demonstrated in vitro a marked growth inhibiting effect of specific IgY on E. coli 0157:H7, showing that growth inhibition was actually caused by the binding of specific IgY to bacterial surface antigens, which caused significant changes in the bacterial surface structure. Another effect of the binding of IgY to bacterial surface antigens is a marked impairment of bacterial attachment to the intestinal mucosa (Marquardt et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2002) . Therefore, therapeutic IgY administration might reduce the clinical use of antibiotics, and thus minimize the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance.",

Mostly, the Ab was incorporated in commercial pellet food. Furthermore, protection of shrimp (Penaeus chinensis) from infection with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has been described. Kim et al. (2004) produced IgY Abs against four different dominant proteins of WSSV and studied the neutralizing activity of these Abs. The authors demonstrated that shrimps survived an injection of WSSV preincubated with anti-WSSV Ab.",

Shin et al. (2003) were able to identify the immunodominant proteins of H. pylori. Antibodies with specificity against these proteins were more effective as prophylactic reagents as compared to Abs directed against the whole bacterial lysate. Altogether, all studies demonstrated a curative effect of the anti-H. pylori Ab. In most cases no complete H. pylori eradication could be achieved. But in view of the increasing bacterial resistance, the use of specific IgY Ab minimizes the need for antibiotics. Horie et al. (2004) carried out a study with 42 volunteers to test the protective effect of drinking yogurt fortified with anti H. pylori urease IgY, obtaining a significant decrease in urea breath values of the treated group. Worledge et al. (2000) demonstrated significant protective effects after oral application of specific IgY against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in an experimental rat model for colitis. TNF is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The oral use of such Abs is considered to have fewer systemic side-effects than the intravenous infusion of a humanised murine anti-TNF monoclonal Ab (Infliximab, Centocor, Malvern, PA, USA). Sunwoo and Sim (2004) reported on the use of IgY Ab against dietary gluten proteins that play a role in the autoimmune disorder of the celiac disease. The authors immunized chickens with gliadins and low-and high-molecular glutenin. The resulting Ab can be used in different forms, such as table eggs, liquid and powdered eggs, and encapsulated nutraceuticals for treatment of celiac disease.",

CF is caused by a mutation of the gene for a chloride channel protein, which results in the secretion of an abnormally thick mucus. This leads to secondary infections in the respiratory tract, caused by several bacterial species, one of which, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, infects virtually all CF patients. The researchers treated CF patients orally with an aqueous IgY anti-P. aeruginosa solution (70 ml, 0.7 mg/ml IgY), given as a mouth rinse in the evening. A high level of the specific chicken Abs could be demonstrated in the saliva by an ELISA for approximately 8 hours after the treatment. The IgY concentration then gradually declined, and was completely undetectable in the saliva 16 hours after the treatment. These oral IgY treatments were successful in reducing chronic P. aeruginosa infections in CF patients, and thus resulted in a decrease in antibiotic prescriptions (Kollberg et al. 2003 ).",

This passive protection was clearly shown with both SPF rats and human volunteers, following the use of either purified IgY or whole-egg powder. Active immunization against S. mutans glucan-binding protein B (GBP-B), under experimental conditions, induces good protection against experimental dental caries. This protection results from the continuous secretion of salivary Abs against GBP-B, which prevents the accumulation of S. mutans on the dental biofilm. The passive protection achieved by IgY is based on the same principle. In fact, the administration of IgY anti-S. mutans GBP-B via the diet and drinking water of experimentally infected rats caused a significant decrease in S. mutans aggregation on dental biofilms. In all these trials, a direct correlation was found between a given IgY dose and a reduction in the incidence of dental caries (Smith et al. 2001) . Furthermore, the decrease in the S. mutans infection rate did not require continuous IgY administration (Smith et al. 2001) . Hatta et al. (1997) evaluated the efficacy of oral IgY anti-S. mutans rinses in human volunteers. This IgY inhibited S. mutans adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs by 59%, while the control IgY from non-immunized hens only gave an 8% inhibition. All these results strongly support the efficacy of oral treatments with anti-S. mutans IgY as a new alternative for reducing dental plaque in humans. Zhou et al. (2003) investigated the protective effect of an anti S. mutans IgY spray in adult volunteers. There was no difference in dental plaque indexes between controls and IgY-spray group although a significant decrease in S. mutans colonies could be demonstrated in the test group after three weeks of IgY application.",

            "text": "Today, there is no doubt that chicken Abs can be produced and used, with minor modifications, in ways similar to the use of mammalian Abs. It can also be said that, depending on the circumstances, the use of IgY Abs often has significant advantages over the use of mammalian Abs. Chickens have the potential to be used to complete the spectrum of animals used for Ab production. The production of chicken monoclonal Abs (and also recombinant IgY or genetically engineered IgY; Nakamura et al. 2004; Tsurushita et al. 2004; Park et al. 2005; Finlay et al. 2005) would combine the advantages of monoclonal Abs with the advantages of chicken Abs. In addition, a further interesting aspect is the immunization of chickens or ducks using DNA constructs (Cova 2005) . It is to be expected that studies on the therapeutic or prophylactic use of IgY Abs will be intensified in the future. In particular, due to the increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics, research on all aspects related to the development of specific IgY Abs against pathogenic microorganisms will have to be stepped up. In the future, IgYs will be universally used in science, including both veterinary and human medicine. IgY technology is a fast developing field and in this concise review we have only described some of its uses. We are convinced that, once accepted and widely used, IgY technology will offer new alternatives and solutions for science, medicine, and society as a whole.",
