The virus can prohibit the cellular immune function by consuming a great deal of immune cells and finally lead to exacerbation of the patients [1, 16] . Therefore, the lymphocyte count could be used as a predictor for the severity of the infectious disease. The CRP and ESR elevated in 20 and 18 cases, although they were not specific indexes of infection, the continuously increased level might indicate the co-infections with some other kinds of bacteria and fungi, and the on course of deterioration of the disease. The LDH level increased in half of our cases, which might own to the cardiac and hepatic injury. The LDH reported in critically ill patients was higher than that in the non-critically ill patients [2, 6] , indicating increased LDH might be a predictive index among the hospitalized patients. The serum potassium slightly decreased in 18 cases, which might due to the increased angiotensin \u2161 leading to the aldosterone secretion from adrenal cortex, and the increased angiotensin \u2161 was found to have a correlation with the severity of the lung infection [17, 18] .
