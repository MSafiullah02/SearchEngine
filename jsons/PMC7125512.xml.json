The fields of public health and medicine, with their emphasis on human health, have difficulty mounting effective responses to these new diseases because they arise in localities very quickly and unpredictably due to their origins in animals (Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats., 2009, Kilpatrick et al., 2006). Since pandemic human HPAI has its origins in avian HPAI, influenza among poultry presents the low probability risk of high-level human pathogenicity that poses a very difficult predicament for public health (Peiris, de Jong, & Guan, 2007).",

One line of thinking in this growing field argues that it is the landscapes that touch on both the wild spaces and intensively human-developed spaces that provide the most likely predictive explanations, and therefore deserve the greatest attention of research (e.g. Wilcox & Colwell, 2005).",

While this focus on the relationship between infectious diseases and urban planning is a welcome development, their planning recommendations generally focus on responses to disease outbreaks instead of prevention. Using the case of avian influenza and urban planning, this study examines some of the planning issues that may be related to preventing the occurrence of EID\u2019s (Wilcox & Colwell, 2005).

After attaining a certain standard of living, however, a nation-state\u2019s focus changes from self-interest, to social interest, and as a result forests are replanted or protected and pollution is controlled. Even though some scholars have shown that Kuznets curves are not applicable universally (see Park, Russell, & Lee, 2007), the debate has illustrated a simple and powerful method for empirically testing hypotheses about nonlinear trajectories of development.",

This categorization is based on the premise that the major environmental causes of traditional health hazards are often problems at the household level (e.g., poor household fuel, water, sanitation, ventilation, food quality). As these are addressed during development there is an increase in the relative importance of the major environmental causes of more modern health hazards which often operate at the community level (e.g. urban air quality, occupational hazards). As these are addressed in richer societies a further transition occurs regarding the global health burden to increase the importance of environmental health hazards at the global level (e.g., global warming), even as traditional diseases like Bubonic Plague might re-emerge in small scales (McMichael et al., 2004).",

Douglass (2000), for example, has identified five key changes and challenges of urban transitional regions important for planners and policy makers: 1) general governance issues; 2) the creation of livable cities through improved environmental management; 3) sustainable and long-term economies; 4) adequate attention to social justice and inequality; and 5) the tendency for uneven spatial development and rural neglect. In addition to these basic principles, others have focused on the growth of illegal settlements (Tang & Chung, 2002), the role of international trade (Pannell & Ma, 1997), as well as the political shifts that occur with such urbanization (Steck, 2006).

Wilcox and Colwell, 2005, Kapan et al., 2006, for example, have hypothesized that increasingly prevalent poultry avian influenza is one such EID that has roots in the confluence of biological, environmental, social and economic changes occurring at fast and slow rates of change within small areas, combined with the inability of social and governance institutions - adapted to known and prior health challenges - to respond to these new and unfamiliar effects on human health. These scholars\u2019 central premise is that human EID risks have arisen due to an inattention to the physical and social changes associated with urban and agrarian transitions that result in increased prevalence of disease among domesticated animals, which in turn is more easily transmitted to humans. Very few (e.g. Ferguson et al., 2005, Longini et al., 2005, Spencer, 2013), however, have empirically modeled the relationship between these combined forces and either human or animal EIDs.",

Longini et al., 2005, Ferguson et al., 2005 separately modeled possible H5N1 (the scientific terminology for virus type in Vietnam) outbreaks among human populations, attempting to predict how a human HPAI pandemic might evolve in Thailand. As a starting point, their analysis used spatial units to predict how quickly and in which geographic directions an H5N1 pandemic would move. While their findings could not conclusively point to future outbreaks, the studies show promise for developing new spatial tools for understanding when a possible epidemic might become a pandemic beyond effective intervention, and thereby have targeted geographic implications for possible responses to a human avian influenza pandemic. Because of their focus on HPAI in humans, neither of these studies contribute significantly to an improved understanding of how and why H5N1 among poultry has evolved in the places it has. Spencer (2013) analysis of district level spatial units in Vietnam seeks to understand the origins of HPAI in poultry by creating \u201ccoherence\u201d indices of micro-spaces in order to determine the association between HPAI poultry outbreaks and the urban transition. These measures also provide a methodological platform for estimating many different acute impacts of the urban transition.",

This method mathematically defines a set of indices of \u201csettlement coherence\u201d based on household-level infrastructure and amenities. In particular, the measure examined household-level building material, water supply, and sanitation systems to estimate the extent to which periurban neighborhoods displayed traditional, transitional, or modern characteristics. Detailed discussion of these coherence indices can be found in Spencer (2013), but, in sum, the original scale from \u22121 to +1 measures the relative mix of four types of household features that are generally considered to be measures of increasing modernization. So, for example, the sanitation coherence measure equals \u22121 where all households in a given commune or district have no toilet (least modern), and a +1 where they all have a flush toilet (most modern). The sanitation coherence measure equals 0, for example, where each of the four household technologies - no toilet, a pit latrine, a composting toilet, or a flush toilet - are 25% of the total. For our purposes here, where we use the variable in a regression model instead of displaying visual patterns, we take the absolute value of the coherence indices. Thus, the lowest-risk areas (both perfectly urban and perfectly rural) at both ends of this metric variable distribution are valued at 1, and highest risk ones at 0.",

We interpret this phenomenon as likely paired with similar results of the secondary education coefficients. While our original hypothesis was that secondary education would be associated with hand-washing and protection from HPAI, the results do imply that this measure may be dominated by its role in approximating rapid \u2013 and largely unmitigated - economic growth. In other words, without an explicit measure of increasingly modern economic opportunities, both household modernization and secondary education serve as proxies for the household wealth accumulation and individual human capital growth, respectively, both of which are linear, and measures of rapid economic development even though they may have some negative externalities. This explanation is much more consistent with our other findings than the explanation that these variables are directly related to HPAI risk. This is not to say that hand-washing is unimportant regarding HPAI risk, but that the positive effects are drowned out by education\u2019s function as a proxy for economic development. Importantly, these findings suggest that HPAI risk in Vietnam is a part of the rapid development process, not necessarily something that is unexpected.",

Our results do clearly show a negative impact of the variable, and is best interpreted as suggesting that work collectives and the local administrative capacities that they represent may embody historical practices and habits that elevate risk of HPAI outbreak.

These very high figures are in striking opposition to other regions of the country, with much lower odds ratios, all of which are less than 1. On the other hand, Table 6 shows the odds ratio for the Red River Delta regarding sanitation coherence is less than 5% likelihood of a sanitation-coherent district having an outbreak compared to a fully incoherent one. The South Southeast remains at elevated HPAI likelihood with greater coherence. There is a similar outlier region for the water supply coherence measure, the South Central Coast, when compared to the other regions in the country which generally have very low outbreak likelihoods for water supply-coherent districts compared to others.

The magnitude of these outliers suggests that there is some important influence affecting these regions, and it is interesting to point out that these regions are the homes to the four largest cities in Vietnam: Ha Noi (7,216,000 population) and Hai Phong (1,763,000 population) lie on opposite ends of the Red River Delta, Ho Chi Minh City (8,146,300 population) is the center of the South Southeast, and Da Nang (1,328,000) is located in the northern part of the South Central Coast. Importantly, the population densities for these cities, respectively, are 2,170, 1,155, 2,170, and 1,033. Interestingly, the next largest city, Can Tho, has a population almost identical to Da Nang\u2019s, but the density is only 885 per square kilometer (all calculations based on 2015 figures, as described in General Statistics Office of Vietnam, 2015).",

While these outlier results for the coherence indices may be simply the result of the urban scale, these are also major trading ports for agricultural and livestock products, as well as local governments with significantly greater local governmental autonomy granted by their classification as within the two top tiers of urban governmental authority in Vietnam. Thus, when taken at the district level, it appears that household infrastructure coherence is not a good predictor of HPAI outbreaks where there is the highest level of urbanization and managed development. This hypothesis explaining these outliers is consistent with Spencer (2013) results, which found that coherence indices correlated with the middle values of coherence, and therefore the cases of completely agrarian and completely urban development. What remains unclear from these regional findings, however, is whether the cause of this lack of fit in the developed urban areas is the result of the levels of economic activities related to poultry consumption, trans-shipment, and other secular trends, or whether the result of large, unified planning districts under control of a single water supply authority, sewer system, or master plan. One way to think about this question is whether the lack of fit results from greater poultry-related activity that elevates risk, or lesser capacities of the risk-reduction infrastructures. An examination of the findings at the commune level may shed some light on this question.",

On the other hand, poultry-related activities have no unified service-type of characteristics, so one would expect much more variation across the municipality that is the result of poultry-oriented activities. Thus, if the risk-reduction capacities were the reason why the coherence indices fit less well in these cities, then one would expect to find similar results when examined at the commune level; if the commune results differ significantly in magnitude and/or direction, it is more likely that the poultry-related activities is the reason why the model does not fit well in these areas.",

Because of this, the district level in a megacity region is likely to represent a very different set of daily relationships among households than it is in a more remote area where agricultural practices are major aspects of daily life. Consistent with this interpretation, the odds ratios for the Red River Delta and the South Southeast at the commune level are much more in line with the other regions\u2019 results. One simple way to think about these outliers is that a district in the mega-region of Ho Chi Minh City is more like a city than it is like a district. On the other hand, any given commune in the Ho Chi Minh City region is probably more like a commune in one of the smaller and more remote regions. Overall, this interpretation suggests that further research must be done if the coherence index approach may is to be appropriate for fully urbanized areas.",

First, theoretically defining and estimating a Kuznets curve for urbanization and human settlement is a key step towards developing a valid theoretical and multivariate - as distinguished from Spencer (2013) \u2013 model for understanding the household infrastructure landscape transition contributors to the emergence of new infectious diseases. More precisely, it seeks to understand the rapid emergence of formerly rare diseases among animals, which in turn presents dire risks for human populations. While our case examines HPAI in the context of Vietnam, the concept and methodology is easily adapted to other concerns ranging from Ebola to the re-emergence of dengue fever. Given the global importance of our rapidly expanding urban landscapes and ecologies, this approach towards the study of urbanization \u2013 and its importance for understanding new health risks \u2013 has broad applicability. Moreover, since urban expansion is largely the result of complex individual and societal decisions, planning and policy has a central role to play. In fact, the types and gaps in urban and regional planning may not just be the solutions to a growing problem of EID\u2019s, but in fact they may be their cause as well. Before such questions can be answered using the coherence indices defined in this paper, however, a better understanding of how the model must be adapted to highly urbanized areas must be developed through future studies.",

One approach following from the analysis would be increased surveillance for HPAI in communities of high \u201cincoherence\u201d as measured by the most robust variables. For this policy implication, our finding that HPAI risk is most elastic and protective with respect to unit changes in sanitation coherence is important. Our research suggests, for example, that targeting those districts with the greatest disparities regarding the mix of sanitation types \u2013 i.e. where sanitation coherence measures are at, or close to zero - would yield the greatest payoffs, even though focusing on water supply characteristics and construction materials would also be helpful. Thus, for example, proactively monitoring poultry flocks in these areas of great diversity in sanitation infrastructure would mean placing monitors there so as to make epidemic and pandemic outbreaks much more quickly identified than is currently possible. Such a directed planning intervention, as opposed to one that spread efforts out across the country with less intensive observation, would lead to improved surveillance results.",
