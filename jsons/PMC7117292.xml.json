            "text": "Numbers of wild boar (Sus scrofa) within Europe has been growing continuously since 1980s. Insufficient hunting together with other various causes have been identified as factors contributing to the population increase. Nowadays, wild boar is one of the most widely distributed mammals in Europe (Massei et al., 2015) and its hunting bag on many localities exceeds 1 ind/km2. High density of wild boar increased damage on field crops and also risk of transmission of pathogens in their populations. Moreover, spreading of human habitation to suburban areas, increased use of lands for agricultural purposes, and deforestation have all enhanced chances of contact between wild boars and humans or domestic animals. Together with recreational hunting and consumption of wild boar meat, that facts form an ideal environment for the transmission of pathogens between wild boars and both humans and domestic animals (Meng et al., 2009). On the contrary, wild boars could become infected from foraged waste of human or domestic animal origin due to their typical behaviour. Wild boar is an omnivore foraging for food mainly close to the soil surface or by grubbing and digging 15 cm deep (\u0160krkal et al., 2015). Moreover, pigs have the ability to discriminate between food sites of different relative value and to remember their respective locations. Food foraging, reproduction, and other social factors may affect the aggregation of animal (Podg\u00f3rski et al., 2014) presenting a determining role in epidemiology of diseases.",

            "text": "Wild boars have been recognized as a source of viral infectious diseases for domestic pigs. The presence of antibodies against viral pathogens or viral nucleic acids of viral pathogens representing a serious economic threat was confirmed in several epidemiological studies; it refers particularly to African swine fever virus (ASFV) (Wo\u017aniakowski et al., 2015), classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (recently reviewed by Moenning, 2015), and Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus (ADV) (Meier et al., 2015). However, not so much is known about other prevalent viral diseases of swine such as porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus (IAV), porcine parvovirus (PPV) (Gonz\u00e1les-Barrio et al., 2015, Sliz et al., 2015, Touloudi et al., 2015). Unexpectedly, specific antibodies against Schmallenberg virus (SBV) were detected in wild boars (Mouchantat et al., 2015). Despite of the fact that enteric viruses are significant pathogens of domestic pigs, they have been studied only sporadically in wild boar. Enteric viruses are transmitted by faecal-oral route, shed in extremely high numbers in the faeces of infected individuals, generally less susceptible to inactivation caused by environmental conditions, and can be easily transported in the environment (Fong and Lipp, 2005). Antibodies against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) have been detected extremely rarely (H\u00e4lli et al., 2012, McGregor et al., 2015). Viral nucleic acids of porcine enteric picornaviruses, comprising teschoviruses, sapeloviruses, and enteroviruses G have been detected in stool samples (Prod\u011blalov\u00e1, 2012, Cano-Gom\u00e9z et al., 2013). Moreover, wild boars represent an important source of zoonotic hepatitis E virus (Schlosser et al., 2015). The prevalence of rotaviruses in wild boars is almost unknown. The only study which detected rotavirus A (RVA) in wild boars was carried out in Japan. Okadera et al. (2013) detected RVA in four animals from 90 tested faecal samples.",

PCR for detection of specific RNA-viruses was accomplished with Fast Start Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche, Germany) and with gene specific primers. The presence of viral RNA of following enteric pathogens was surveyed: RVA, RVC, members of family Coronaviridae (specifically TGEV, PEDV, porcine respiratory coronavirus \u2013 PRCV, and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus \u2013 PHEV), PRRSV, enterovirus G (EV-G), teschovirus A (PTV), sapelovirus A (PSV). Detection of PTV and PSV was carried out with the use of one primer pair; the two virus species were distinguished according to the PCR product length (PTV \u2013 161 bp, PSV \u2013 180 bp) and verified with sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon, Germany). Detection of members of Coronaviridae family was accomplished with the use of universal primers detecting four viral species (TGEV, PEDV, PRCV, and PHEV). The specificity of detection primers was verified on the specific pathogens deposited in the Collection of Animal Pathogenic Microorganisms (CAPM, Veterinary Research Institute, Brno) and in the case of RVC on own field isolates of porcine strains (Moutel\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2014). To increase the sensitivity of the reactions, the second round of PCR was carried out with a semi-nested pair of primers (in RVC and Coronaviridae detection) or with the same set of primers as in the first round. Limit of detection (LOD) of the RT-PCR assay with re-amplification was specified for RVA assay by 10-fold serial dilution of porcine RVA strain with known original concentration which was determined by transmission electron microscope virus quantitation using latex particles (Malenovska, 2013). The minimal concentration of RVA still detected was 1.2 \u00d7 103 virus particles/1 g of faeces. Used primers, sizes of the expected amplicons and references are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The PCR products were examined by electrophoreses in a 2% agarose gel, stained with Midori Green stain (Nippon Genetics Europe, Germany) and visualized by ultraviolet transillumination. Selected PCR products of used diagnostic assays were submitted to sequencing and obtained sequences were analysed with the use of BLAST on-line tool to confirm their classification into respective viral species.\n",

The primers used for the whole (VP7, VP6) or partial (VP4) ORF preparation are described in the Supplementary Table S2. The obtained sequences were phylogenetically analysed with the MEGA version 6 (Tamura et al., 2013). The dendrograms were prepared with the neighbor-joining method and the evolutionary distances were calculated with the use of Kimura 2-parameter model (Kimura, 1980). To assess the reliability of constructed phylogenetic trees, the bootstrap test with 1000 of replicates was used. The bootstrap value >75% indicates satisfactory topology of phylogenetic tree branches; the bootstrap value of 95\u2013100% is very good. To classify the RVA sequence into the corresponding genotype, the percentage of nucleotide sequence similarity between the Czech RVA strains and RVA sequences deposited in the GenBank was calculated using the p-distances method. The VP7, VP4, and VP6 genotypes of RVA strains were determined with the use of previously published cut-off values (Matthijnssens et al., 2008). The assigned genotypes were verified with RotaC online tool (Maes et al., 2009) in accord with the Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG) guidelines.\n",

            "text": "Porcine rotaviruses (both RVA and RVC) are considered to be major pathogens causing diarrhoea in pigs. Transmission of RVC from animal reservoir to human host was reported only once in Brazil (Gabbay et al., 2008) and owing to high degree of conservation (>93% of nucleotide sequence identity) of all segments of human RVC isolates (except for the VP3 gene) (Ghosh and Kobayashi, 2011) it may be presumed that zoonotic transmission of RVC strains is a rare event. However, zoonotic potential of RVA strains has been proven repeatedly (Zeller et al., 2012, Papp et al., 2013). So far, there is no available information concerning RVC prevalence in wild boars and only very limited knowledge about RVA detected in wild boars in Japan (Okadera et al., 2013). The detected RVC prevalence in our study was 12.8% (26/203) including coinfections with other enteral viruses. Similar prevalence of RVC was detected in domestic pigs in the Czech Republic (25.6%) (Moutel\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2014), in South Korea (26.2%) (Jeong et al., 2009) or in Italy (31.3%) (Martella et al., 2007). Although the RVC infection can cause severe gastroenteritis in pigs of all ages, it may also have subclinical course (Amimo et al., 2013). The samples collected during our study came from animals without any apparent clinical signs of a disease and the faeces processed were of normal consistence. RVA was in the Czech wild boars detected in 2.5% (5/203) of tested samples which is in agreement with results of Okadera et al. (2013). They found RVA in 4.4% of tested faecal samples from wild boars in Japan. The possibility of RVA transmission between wild boars and domestic pigs in Japan was supported by very close phylogenetic relationship between their VP7 and VP4 nucleotide sequences. The RVA-positive strain P70/2015 detected during our survey showed the highest similarities of all studied genomic segments to human RVA strains which were described elsewhere as porcine-human reassortments (Mullick et al., 2013, Zhou et al., 2015). It is of great interest that the P[25] genotype of VP4 segment was found so far only very rarely in several RVA strains isolated from humans. This genotype is thought to be of porcine origin but so far no porcine (or other animal) sample was described to bear this scarce VP4 genotype (Matthijnssens et al., 2010). This is the first time the possible animal progenitor strain reservoir of P[25] genotype was described and surprisingly it might be the wild boar population. Up to date, only eight RVA strains isolated from wild boars were genetically described so we cannot reason out how frequent separate RVA genotypes might be among wild boars and whether the proportional representation of genotypes is similar as in domestic pigs. Phylogenetic analysis of VP7 and VP4 genome segments of another RVA strain from our study (P211/2014) also clustered this wild boar RVA strain together with human RVA strains isolated in Hungary and Belgium (Zeller et al., 2012, Papp et al., 2013). The whole genomic sequences of those human RVA strains were described and it was found that those human strains originated from porcine or porcine-human reassortment RVA strains. It is of interest, that all analysed wild boar RVA strains were found in the region of South Moravia, namely near the town of Brno (RVA strain P245/2014) and in the vicinity of the confluence of Morava and Thaya Rivers very close to the Czech and Slovakian borders (RVA strains P70/2015, P211/2014, P218/2015). This area of the confluence is regularly flooded which forces increased migration of wildlife animals and it can also contribute to spreading of enteric viruses through contaminated water. The Morava River later joins the Danube River near Slovakian and Hungarian borders. At present, it is not possible to answer if the wild boar RVA strains which show close relationship to Hungarian human strains (P70/2015, P211/2014) are also circulating among wild boars in Hungary, as there is no relevant data available. Considering very low nucleotide sequences similarities of the Czech wild boar RVA strains we may presume that a large numbers of different RVA strains is currently circulating among wild boars.",

            "text": "Although PTVs, PSVs, and EV-Gs are generally considered to be nonpathogenic (causing asymptomatic infections in most cases), PTV-1 strains are causative agents of acute disease of swine called Teschovirus encephalomyelitis, which is characterised by central nervous system disorders. Some PTV serotypes were detected rarely in association with reproductive failure, diarrhoea, pneumonia, pericarditis, and myocarditis (Knowles, 2006). PSVs were connected with clinical signs of diarrhoea, pneumonia, and reproductive disorders. EV-G was originally isolated from atypical skin lesions and the role of the virus as enteric pathogen causing diarrhoea was discussed (Knowles, 2006). Infected pigs are an important source of PTV, PSV, or EV-G infection and contamination of water and environment since these viruses are easily transferred by faecal-oral route. The zoonotic potential of porcine enteric picornaviruses was not described so far but the transmission between domestic pigs and wild boars is highly probable (Prod\u011blalov\u00e1, 2012). One or more members of family Picornaviridae (PTV, PSV, and EV-G) were detected in 26.6% of wild boars tested in our study. PTV was the most prevalent of all detected viruses and was found in 20.2% of all samples. PSV was found less often (8.9% of all samples). Even higher prevalence of PTV was described in wild boars in Spain where 50.8% of tested samples were PTV-positive, while only 6.4% of samples contained PSV (Cano-Gom\u00e9z et al., 2013). Similarly high prevalence of porcine enteric picornaviruses was earlier shown in wild boars in the Czech Republic (Prod\u011blalov\u00e1, 2012), where 44.4% of tested samples were positive for PTV and 27.8% for PSV. EV-G was in the Czech Republic detected in 69.4% which is more than ten times higher prevalence than the number of EV-G-positive samples detected in this study. The reason might be that wild boars tested previously in the Czech Republic were animals kept in enclosure in four wild boar farms where there is a higher probability of virus transmission between animals. In the present study the animals tested were free-ranging wild boars culled during hunting season in at least 16 places located in four regions covering over 35 000 km2.",

So far, the evidence of PRRS virus presence in wild boar was confirmed in Germany (Reiner et al., 2009) or recently in Slovakia (Vilcek et al., 2015). In those studies, tissues of lungs, tonsils or spleen were used for PRRSV detection, which are the places of virus replication. Our study did not confirm presence of PRRSV nucleic acid in wild boar faeces although the shedding of virus in faeces of domestic pigs was previously documented (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2008).",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the prevalence of RVC was assessed in wild boars. RVA strains isolated from wild boars were genetically described and close relationship with human and domestic pig RVA strains was found so the transmission of RVA between wild boars and humans or between domestic pigs and humans and subsequently between domestic pigs and wild boars is highly probable. Furthermore, high prevalence of PTV in Czech wild boars was confirmed, PSV and EV-G were found less frequently. During our study no PRRSV or members of family Coronaviridae were detected. Our findings indicate that wild boars might contribute to the genetic variability of RVA and also serve as an important reservoir of other enteric viruses including RVC, PTV, PSV, and EV-G.",
