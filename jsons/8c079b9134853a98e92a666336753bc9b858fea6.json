They found that 97% of cases with RT-PCR-confirmed diagnoses had CT findings of pneumonia, and conclude, \"CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19\". Other investigators are less optimistic. Inui Things look different now. The US and UK Governments have provided among the world's worst responses to the pandemic, with sheer lies and incompetence from the former, and near-criminal delays and obfuscation from the latter. Neither country has widespread testing available, as strongly recommended by WHO, alongside treatment and robust contact tracing. 1 In neither country do health workers have adequate access to personal protective equipment; nor are there nearly enough hospital beds to accommodate the onslaught of patients. Even worse, by refusing to ease sanctions against Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba, the US has crippled the ability of other countries to respond, continuing to block medical supplies and other humanitarian aid. 2 Meanwhile, Asian countries, including China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, have provided rapid, effective, and often innovative responses, thanks in part to their recent experience with outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015 and the 2002-03 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. China has convened hundreds of foreign officials to share lessons, and dispatched experts, masks and other supplies to Italy and other affected countries. Cuba has also sent doctors to help with the response, and welcomed sick cruise ship passengers refused entry by the USA.",

Group activities in nursing homes were also prohibited. As a consequence, the residents of nursing homes became more socially isolated. We have observed that under the dual stress of fear of infection and worries about the residents' condition, the level of anxiety among staff in nursing homes increased and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout after a monthlong full lockdown of the facilities. patients who require imaging.

We believe CT does not add diagnostic value; positive results can only be believed if the pre-test probability of disease is high. Using CT diagnostically is not known to provide clinical benefit and could lead to false security if results are negative. If COVID-19 is suspected, patients should be isolated pending confirmation with (multiple) RT-PCR tests, or until quarantine has lapsed. The results of a CT scan do not change this.",
