It is now having a serious socioeconomic impact worldwide. In China, a total of 78,064 patients with COVID-19 have been identified thus far, and containment in Hubei is still in progress. A total of 400 patients with COVID-19 have been reported in Italy as of 9 o'clock on March 26 th , 2020. The world is ongoing in pandemic 3 . As the outbreak progresses, cancer patients receiving radiation therapy and healthcare professionals (such as medical doctors, nurses, medical physicists, and radiation therapists) are at risk of infection.",
