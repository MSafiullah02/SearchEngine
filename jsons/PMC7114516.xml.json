            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease that first occurred in November 2002 in Guangdong Province of China (Xu et al., 2004a, Xu et al., 2004b), has spread to 28 regions around the world in 2003 causing 774 deaths in 8096 infected individuals (WHO, 2004). A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the etiological agent of the disease (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003) and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus was different from previously known coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Although the identification of the etiological agent and molecular studies on the SARS-CoV proceeded rather rapidly, the puzzle on the origin of the disease was still not fully resolved. From the very beginning, data suggested that SARS was originated from animals. For examples: (1) Animal food handlers who handle, kill, or butcher \u201cexotic\u201d animals for food were over represented among early-onset SARS cases (Xu et al., 2004a, Xu et al., 2004b, Zhong et al., 2003). (2) Serological studies of traders from several selected animal markets in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province in 2003 indicated that the animal traders had significantly higher prevalence of IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV than vegetable traders or control groups (Xu et al., 2004a, Xu et al., 2004b, CDC, 2003). These data pointed to the fact that animals being sold in markets as a likely source of the virus. Therefore, after the outbreak of SARS, many scientists concentrated their efforts on investigating the animal origin of SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "A breakthrough came in May of 2003 when viruses related to SARS were identified in animals. A team led by Yi Guan (Hong Kong University) and colleagues from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Shenzhen, studied 25 individuals from 8 different species including 6 masked palm civets (Paguma larvata), 1 raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), 2 Chinese ferret-badgers (Melogale moschata), 3 hog-badgers (Arctonyx collaris), 3 beavers (Castor fiber), 4 domestic cats (Felis catus), 3 Chinese hares (Lepus sinensis) and 2 Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) gathered in Dongmen Market, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province (Guan et al., 2003). Nasal and faecal swabs from the animals were tested for SARS-CoV nucleic acid by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the N gene of the human SARS-CoV, and all the swaps were inoculated into FRhK-4 cells for virus isolation. All of the six masked palm civets and one raccoon dog were positive for SARS-CoV by either RT-PCR and/or virus isolation. Sera from five animals including three masked palm civets, a raccoon dog and a Chinese ferret badger, had neutralizing antibody against a SARS-CoV isolated from a masked palm civet (SZ16). The neutralizing antibody titer was \u2265640, 40, 40 for the three masked palm civets, \u2265640 for the raccoon dog and 160 for the Chinese ferret badger (Guan et al., 2003). It is interesting to note that one of the masked palm civet, which was tested positive for SARS-CoV nucleic acid both in nasal and faecal swabs was negative for neutralizing antibodies against its own SZ16 virus. It implied that this animal was either newly infected or it had developed mechanisms to avoid generating neutralizing antibodies. This study raised the initial alert that masked palm civets and other wildlife animals may play a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV and led to a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in Guangdong Province.",

            "text": "Later in 2003, the role of masked palm civets and other animals was questioned and a debate ensued on whether these animals are actually the origin of the SARS-CoV. A rather convincing evidence implicating masked palm civets came in approximately half a year later in the winter of 2003\u20132004. Between 16 December 2003 and 8 January 2004, a total of four patients were identified as SARS cases with mild flu-like syndromes and no secondary transmission (Liang et al., 2004). Epidemiological information collected by the Guangdong CDC and Guangzhou CDC indicated that three of the patients had direct or indirect contact to masked palm civets. The second patient was a waitress in a local restaurant (TDLR), where live masked palm civets were kept for exotic dishes, and she often passed by or stood in close proximity of the animal cages (Wang et al., 2005b). The fourth patient dined in the same restaurant and his dining table was within 5 m of civet cages (Wang et al., 2005b). The third patient dined in a neighboring restaurant (SJR), which shared the kitchen with TDLR (Song et al., 2005). The masked palm civets kept in TDLR restaurant were reported to have been originally purchased from the Xinyuan Live Animal Market (Wang et al., 2005b). Three research teams published their results on the SARS-CoV-like viruses in masked palm civets from the TDLR restaurant and from the Xinyuan Live Animal Market as well as the four patients (Kan et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005b). Almost identical sequences of the SARS-CoV spike genes were identified in samples from some of the patients and from masked palm civets in either the restaurant or the Xinyuan Live Animal Market (Kan et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005b). Based on virological and epidemiological findings, Guangdong provincial officials took an aggressive action on 5 January 2004 to destroy any animals that might harbor the SARS-CoV in farms and in animal food markets. Quarantine on all civets reared for human consumption in farms all over China was imposed. Since then, no additional community-acquired SARS cases have been reported.",

(2) Although masked palm civets in markets had a high prevalence for SARS-CoV during the epidemic (Guan et al., 2003, Kan et al., 2005, Tu et al., 2004), investigations on farmed masked palm civets were often negative for the SARS-CoV (Kan et al., 2005, Tu et al., 2004) with only a few exceptions (Hu et al., 2005, Tu et al., 2004). (3) An investigation of 21 wild masked palm civets trapped in Hong Kong indicated that those animals were free of SARS-CoV-like viruses suggesting the virus is not widely circulating in wild masked palm civets (Poon et al., 2005).",

Bats have long been known as an important reservoir for many zoonotic viruses including rabies virus, Hendra virus, Nipha virus, Ebola virus and St. Louis encephalitis viruses (Halpin et al., 2000, Leroy et al., 2005, Mackenzie et al., 2001, Mackenzie and Field, 2004). An early study by Poon et al. (2005) on 81 bats belonging to 12 different species identified a novel bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV) from three different bat species of the same genus, Miniopterus magnater, Miniopterus pusillus, and Miniopterus schreibersi. However, the Bat-CoV belonged to group 1 coronavirus and was not closely related to SARS-CoV since its RNA fragments shared only 41\u201362% nucleotide sequence identities to SARS-CoV (Poon et al., 2005). This initial failure to identify a SARS-CoV-like virus in bats was soon compensated by the successful detection, by two other independent groups, of several SARS-CoV-like viruses in different species of horseshoe bats (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005b).",

It was reported that in 2003 about 40,000 masked palm civets were raised in 660 farms all over China (Jiang et al., 2003). The farms started either from capture and breeding of local wild animals or from breeding stocks brought in from other farms. The feed for the farmed animals varied depending on the particular farm but usually contained grains such as maize, beans, rice and animal feed such as powdered products from fish or bones and often supplemented with fresh meat and/or parts from other animals (Zhou, 1994, Shao and Li, 1997). By studying body temperature and weight, food intake, shedding and living habits of 87 wild masked palm civets in farms, Zhang et al. (1991a) found that masked palm civets in Shanxi Province hibernated slightly from December to February for about 75\u201385 days. A similar study showed that the masked palm civets in Hunan Province (south of Yangzhi River) also hibernated slightly from December to February as their body temperature dropped 3\u20134 \u00b0C and other physiological indexes decreased significantly compared with those during normal period (Kang et al., 1997).",

SARS-CoV antibody levels in farmed animals were lower than those from the market. Intestinal tissues collected from the 56 civets were tested by RT-PCR and none were positive. Analysis of 47 serum samples collected in June 2003 from two farms in Henan and Hunan Provinces were negative by a neutralization test and an immunofluoresence antibody assay. The authors also mentioned previously unpublished data on SARS-CoV in the Xinyuan Live Animal Market in Guangzhou, in Guangdong Centre for Rescue and Care of Wildlife Animals, and in a civet farm in Jiangxi Province. These data indicated a high percentage of infected civets in one particular market at a specific time, while no indication of civet infection was seen on most farms during the same period. The authors suggested that the high prevalence in market civets might be associated with trading activities under conditions of overcrowding and mixing of various animal species (Tu et al., 2004).",

Twenty of the SNVs cause nonsynonymous aa substitution, including seven in ORF1ab (aa 1121, 1663, 2746, 2971, 3047, 3072, 5767), eight in the spike protein (aa 77, 244, 344, 360, 487, 665, 778, 1163), three in ORF3a (aa 7, 81, 121), one in M protein (aa 5) and one in N protein (aa 17) (Table 2). It is interesting to see that all but one of the 26 SNVs from masked palm civets were also conserved in sequences from the 2004 patients with mild symptoms (Table 2). Based on epidemiological and molecular data, the patients of the 2003 epidemic were classified as early, middle and late phases (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Many of the 26 SNVs from masked palm civets were conserved in the genomes from early human cases in the 2003 epidemic. Some remained unchanged in the genomes of the middle phase patients but all were lost in the late phase patients. At least one of the mutations, aa 487 in the spike protein, was shown to be important in the adaptation of SARS-CoV to human cells (Li et al., 2005c, Qu et al., 2005). Analysis of the structures of the spike protein and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003) indicated that aa 487 of spike is important for spike-ACE2 interaction and a mutation from Ser487 (civet) to Thr487 appeared to enhance human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005c). Residues 344 and 360 of the spike protein are distant from the binding interface in the spike-ACE2 complex (Li et al., 2005a), and these two mutations do not affect binding affinity or infectivity of the SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005c, Qu et al., 2005). Whether the rest of the aa residues play important roles during cross species transmission or human-to-human transmission shall need further investigations.",

It is a 27-nt sequence in PC4-227 lacking the last two nts of the 29-nt. The 29-nt sequence was first identified in SZ3 and SZ16 (Guan et al., 2003) and was also found in some early epidemic human samples such as GD01, GZ02, HSZ-Bb, HSZ-Bc, HSZ-Cb, and HSZ-Cc (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). The 29-nt was suggested as a marker to distinguish the strain that originated from masked palm civet and the later epidemic strains (Guan et al., 2003, Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). The 29-nt fuses ORF8a and ORF8b into a single ORF. A recent study by Yount et al. (2005) using recombinant virus has shown that the 29-nt had little if any impact on in vitro growth or RNA synthesis. It was predicted that the occurrences of deletions in ORF8a/8b region might be related to the RNA secondary structure of this region (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Nevertheless, this 29-nt deletion reflected an important evolutionary event of SARS-CoV-like viruses in their adaptation from masked palm civets to humans. Interestingly, the bat SARS-CoV-like viruses also harbor a 29-nt sequence and encode a single ORF8, although the similarity of the ORF8 is very low to that of SARS-CoV-like viruses in masked palm civets (see below).",

Several studies have been conducted to estimate the substitution rate and to identify the most recent common ancestor of the SARS-CoV. By analyzing 10 genome sequences of the 2003 Chinese patient samples and their epidemiological information, it was determined that the synonymous substitution rate of SARS-CoV genome to be 8.26 \u00d7 10\u22126 (\u00b12.16 \u00d7 10\u22126) nucleotides per site per day and the date for the most recent common ancestor was estimated to range from early June to the end of December 2002 (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Zhao et al. (2004) analyzed 11 genomic sequences from different parts of the world during 2003 SARS epidemic and found that the mutation rate to be in the order of 0.80\u20132.38 \u00d7 10\u22123 nucleotide substitution per site per year (2.2\u20136.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 nucleotide substitutions per site per day) and the most recent common ancestor of the sequences was inferred to be present as early as the spring of 2002. Analysis on the Singapore isolates from the 2003 epidemic revealed that the mutation rate to be 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 nucleotide substitutions per site per day, with the rates for synonymous and non-synonymous mutations at 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 nucleotide substitutions per site per day, respectively (Vega et al., 2004). All the above studies used human samples with available clinical data from the 2003 outbreak and the substitution rates of SARS-CoV genome obtained from the various studies were in good agreement with each other. In comparison to other coronaviruses, the estimated substitution rate of SARS-CoV is lower than that in mouse hepatitis virus (Chen and Baric, 1995) and similar to that in the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Enjuanes et al., 1992), but higher than that in the infectious bronchitis virus (Cavanagh et al., 1998).",

So far, propagation in cell culture of SARS-CoV-like viruses from masked palm civets seems to be difficult. Initially, it was reported that SZ16 replicated in FRhK-4 cells (Guan et al., 2003), but no further reports have been published. Wang et al. (2005b) reported that SARS-CoV-like virus from a rectal swab specimen of a masked palm civet replicated in FRhK-4 cells cultured but not in Vero E6 cells. Similarly, viruses from the four mild symptom patients of 2004 could not be propagated in cell lines (Liang et al., 2005). Because it has been reported that certain aa residues are important for the viral spike protein to interact with its specific receptor ACE2 (Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005c, Li et al., 2006, Qu et al., 2005), selecting or engineering a cell line capable of supporting the interaction of receptor and S proteins of SARS-CoV-like viruses may be essential to overcome the obstacles in isolation of live viruses from civets and other animal sources.",

Most of deletion and insertion sites are present in nsp3, S and ORF8 (Fig. 1, Fig. 3), which result in a low similarity with SARS-CoV in the S protein (76\u201378%) and in ORF8 (35% for Rp3, HKU3-1, HKU3-2 and Rm1, 80% for Rf1). The 29-nt region, which is present only in SARS-CoV from masked palm civets and in the early phase human patients, also existed in all bat SL-CoVs and resulted in a fused ORF (ORF8). The low similarity in ORF8 between SARS-CoV from human/civet and bat SL-CoV is also seen between bat SL-CoV Rf1 and other three isolates. Analysis of ORF8 indicated that Rf1 was more closely related to SARS-CoV than to other bat SL-CoV isolates.

The putative S2 domain of all SL-CoVs has a high identity with that of SARS-CoVs (96%). All sites that are critical for SARS virus fusion to cell membranes are highly conserved in SL-CoVs putative S2 domain, suggesting that SL-CoVs possess the same fusion mechanism to host cells as SARS-CoVs. However, the putative S1 domain of SL-CoVs has low similarity to that of SARS-CoVs, especially in N-terminus and the receptor-binding domain (RBD, 318-510 aa of Tor2 S1 domain) (Wong et al., 2004). One insertion of 6 aa residues and three deletion sites are present in the S1 domain of bat SL-CoVs, among which two deletion sites (5 and 12\u201313 aa, respectively) are present in RBD particularly in the receptor binding motif (RBM, 424\u2013494 of Tor2 S1 domain) (Li et al., 2005a) (Fig. 3). These differences may imply that bat SL-CoVs may use a vastly diverse ACE2 or even a different molecule as the entry receptor.",

Naturally, raccoon dogs are omnivores and change their food according to the seasonal food availability. Rodents, frogs, lizards, invertebrates, birds and their eggs are often eaten, specially in the early summer. Plants and mushrooms are eaten, while berries and fruits are favored in late summer and autumn. Raccoon dogs are nocturnal and they hibernate in winter. They are strictly monogamous and live in pairs (Kauhala and Saeki, 2004).",

In May 2003, Guan et al. isolated a SARS-CoV-like virus from the feacal sample of a raccoon dog (SZ13) from the Dongmen animal Market, in Shenzhen. The neutralization antibody titer of the serum of the raccoon dog was \u2265640 against the SARS-CoV-like virus of a masked palm civet (SZ16) (Guan et al., 2003). In January 2004, Kan et al. investigated 15 raccoon dogs from the Xinyuan animal market, Guangzhou. Of the 15 raccoon dogs, by real-time and nested RT-PCR, 12 were tested positive with both throat and rectal swabs, while 3 tested positive with throat swabs only (Kan et al., 2005). So far there are three spike sequences of raccoon dogs, that of SZ13 (Guan et al., 2003), A030G (Kan et al., 2005), and A031G (Kan et al., 2005). All of them, however, were found to be identical to certain sequences found in masked palm civets. For example, the sequence of SZ13 is identical to that of SZ16 (Guan et al., 2003), and A030G and A031G are identical to A022G (Kan et al., 2005). It remains unclear whether the raccoon dogs were infected by the virus from the masked palm civets or the other way around. It is also possible that both animals were infected by the virus from a hitherto unidentified host. Unlike the situation with masked palm civets, very limited research has been conducted to survey wild or farmed raccoon dog.",

Real-time RT-PCR revealed that 4 out of 20 cats, 3 out of 5 red foxes, and 1 out of 6 Lesser rice field rats were positive for SARS-CoV. The N and P genes sequences were determined and shown to be identical to those of the human SARS-CoVs. After culling of animals and disinfection of the market place, follow up surveillance was conducted 2 weeks later and only one greylag goose out of 119 animals tested positive for SARS-CoV. At this time cats did not test positive for the virus (Wang et al., 2005a). Also, the same team reported that in 2004, one wild boar out of 102 animals tested positive (Wang et al., 2005a) (Table 4). Since the environment of the animal market was heavily contaminated with SARS-CoV-like viruses during that period (Kan et al., 2005), it remains unknown whether those animals that tested positive by PCR were truly susceptible hosts or simply mechanical carriers of SARS-CoV genetic materials. In this regard, it is worth to note that under experimental conditions, goose was not susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (Swayne et al., 2004).",

It is still uncertain whether the masked palm civets were infected during trading in animal market or were naturally infected in the wild or under farmed conditions. The very high nt sequence identity among the masked palm civet SARS-CoV-like viruses (>99.6%) clearly suggested that the virus has not resided in the masked palm civet population for a very long time. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that masked palm civets are highly susceptible to the SARS-CoV (Wu et al., 2005, Kan et al., 2005) where the virus can be amplified to very high titers (Kan et al., 2005). Therefore, detailed surveys of the SARS-CoV in masked palm civets will continue to play an important role in the prevention of potential future SARS outbreaks.",

            "text": "Bats, the only flying mammals, constitute about 20% of the mammalian diversity (Kunz and Fenton, 2003). They are distributed widely in the world and most of them are gregarious. Because of unknown mechanisms, they appear to be natural reservoirs of several new and re-emerging viruses, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Menangle virus, lyssavirus and Ebola virus, etc. over the last 20 years (Leroy et al., 2005, Mackenzie et al., 2001). Horseshoe bats have been found to be a natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-like virus. The genetic diversity of coronaviruses found in bats highlighted our poor understanding of viruses in wild animals. Moreover, bats that harbor the viruses rarely display clinical signs or overt symptoms of pathology. Even though there was little direct evidence to indicate that viruses in bats can cause the severe disease in other domestic animals and in humans, there is an increased possibility of virus variants crossing the species barrier and causing outbreaks in humans as people come into closer contact with wild animals. It is therefore essential to study the viral pathology in the host and to enhance our knowledge and understanding of reservoir host distribution, animal-to-animal and human-to-animal interactions. It is also interesting to find out why bats are such a natural reservoir for so many viruses. It is intriguing to speculate if this is related to the bats\u2019 immune system and/or to their ecology. During the search for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV, the investigators also found several new types of coronavirus which are closely related to group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses, further indicating that bats can harbour a much wider spectrum of coronaviruses (Lau et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005). It is not known whether the coronaviruses in bats would cause a zoonotic disease in humans or in other animals. All these uncertainties underscore the need for further investigations to understand the ecology and pathogenicity of these viruses.",

As it was pointed out by Li et al. (2006) that substantial genetic changes in the spike protein of bat SL-CoV are likely to be necessary for the virus to infect humans. Further investigations might reveal viruses with higher identity to SARS-CoV in bats or with lower identity in masked palm civets. However, it is likely that in the emerging path of SARS-CoV, there are still other species missing between horseshoe bats and masked palm civets. One way of revealing possible links and suspects is to look at the ecological circles of both bats and masked palm civets. Alternatively, constant survey of wild animal species for SARS-CoV-like viruses should provide further information on animal reservoirs.",
