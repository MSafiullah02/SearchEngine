            "text": "Human severe acute respiratory syndrome (hSARS)\u2014the first major new infectious disease of this century\u2014is unusual in its high mortality and infectivity rates. It is an acute respiratory illness that is caused by infection with the human SARS corona virus (hSARS\u2010CoV), and probably originates from a wild reservoir. It is a novel corona virus that is related to other previously documented corona viruses, which are largely confined to domestic and other animal species.1\u20134 It has now crossed the species barrier with a new variant form. The spread of this new extremely virulent SARS virus infection in humans led to the first global pandemic of the 21st century, during which over 8000 people became infected and more than 900 died. Intense research led to the complete genome sequence of SARS\u2010CoV within six months of it being reported.5, 6 As a prevention strategy for SARS infection, attention has been drawn to the development of an effective vaccine for the virus,7 but it is also necessary to have therapeutic options available for those who have already been infected. Currently, there is no treatment available for this rapidly spreading infection. Normally, patients who have contracted this syndrome are administered common antiviral drugs with minimal or no results, and are kept in isolation or quarantine. Research during the past three years has indicated that among many targets, the fusogenic envelope glycoprotein of SARS\u2010CoV, also called spike (S) protein, is a major target for therapy.8\u201310 Spike protein mediates viral fusion and the delivery of the viral genome into the host cell. Consequently, a S protein\u2010targeted approach, when applied at the initial stage of infection is likely to reduce infection within and beyond the respiratory organs. We recently reported11 that S protein is proteolytically processed by membrane\u2010bound furin, a member of mammalian subtilase proprotein convertases (PCs).12, 13 This cleavage occurs at the RNTR761\u2193EV site,11 and leads to the formation of two mature fragments: N\u2010terminal S1 and C\u2010terminal S2 (Figure 1); each fragment has distinct biological functions. Following cleavage, S1, the globular part of S protein mediates binding to the host cell\u2010surface receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).14 A 193\u2010amino\u2010acid segment (from residues 318\u2013510) of S protein has been identified as the receptor\u2010binding domain.15 S2, a more conserved domain, forms the membrane\u2010anchored stalk region and mediates virus\u2013host cell fusion.16 Ex\u2010vivo studies with FD11 and Vero E6 cells also revealed that two other membrane\u2010bound PCs, namely PC5B and PC7, cleave S protein; but a comparative study of their efficacies was not made either with the membrane\u2010bound or soluble C\u2010terminal\u2010truncated forms. In this regard, more work is needed because these PCs have been implicated in the proteolytic maturation of a large number of other viral glycoproteins that contain a PC\u2010recognition motif at the cleavage site.17 In this work, we have conducted an in vitro comparative study on the cleavage of hSARS S protein with the soluble forms of furin, PC5, and PC7 by using an intramolecularly quenched model fluorogenic (IQF) peptide that was derived from the S protein cleavage site. We have also investigated the ability of a PC inhibitor to block this cleavage. Moreover, we examined the solution\u2010phase structure of this peptide by using circular dichroism (CD) and 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy studies, and have found important structural and conformational features of S protein near the crucial activation site. While CD spectroscopy18 was used to determine the secondary structure of several SARS\u2010CoV\u2010derived peptides under various conditions,19, 20 NMR data21 were more useful for determining its solution\u2010phase structure under conditions that mimic a physiological environment.",

The location of these peptides and the various important domains of spike protein, including the heptad repeat and transmembrane domains are shown in Figure 1 by using IQF QSARS\u20104 as a model peptide. The chemical synthesis of IQF QSARS\u20104 peptide was carried out with solid\u2010phase Fmoc chemistry and was based on various steps of repetitive Fmoc deprotections and amide couplings by using HATU and DIEA (http://www.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2268/2007/f700007_s.pdf). In this peptide, electron transfer takes place from the donor Abz function to the acceptor nitrotyrosine moiety; this leads to the quenching of its fluorescence property (http://www.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2268/2007/f700007_s.pdf). The selection of the above peptides was guided primarily by the presence of a PC sequence recognition motif, and sizes of the cleaved bands obtained in coinfection experiments with full\u2010length hSARS\u2010CoV spike protein and individual full\u2010length PCs.13 Among all of the IQF peptides tested, only QSARS\u20104 was found to be cleaved significantly by furin, PC5, and PC7 (vide infra), and therefore this peptide was further subjected to investigation for evaluation of its conformation and secondary structure.",

Thus, it was evident that both furin and PC5, which have similar levels of enzyme activity compared to PC7 (as determined by active\u2010site titration with the inhibitor Dec\u2010RVKR\u2010cmk and assay), cleave QSARS\u20104 peptide efficiently at the correct physiological site (R761\u2193E) as confirmed by mass spectra data of the HPLC peaks (Figure 2). Thus, upon cleavage QSARS\u20104 (Abz\u2010755Glu\u2010Gln\u2010Asp\u2010Arg\u2010Asn\u2010Thr\u2010Arg\u2010Glu\u2010Val\u2010Phe\u2010Ala\u2010Gln766\u2010Tyx\u2010NH2; retention time (t\nR) 38.4 min; M\nw 1818 Da) generated two additional peaks at t\nR 23.6 and 36.1 min for the N\u2010terminal fragment (NT), Abz\u2010Glu\u2010Gln\u2010Asp\u2010Arg\u2010Asn\u2010Thr\u2010Arg\u2010OH (M\nw 1036 Da) and the C\u2010terminal fragment (CT), Glu\u2010Val\u2010Phe\u2010Ala\u2010Gln\u2010Tyx\u2010NH2 (M\nw 801 Da), respectively. The peak areas that correspond to the NT and CT fragments were significantly higher in furin and PC5 digests compared to PC7 digest. In fact, the intensities of these fragment peaks were very weak in the HPLC chromatogram of the PC7 digest. Based on peak heights or areas, it is estimated that about 18\u201325 % of the peptide is cleaved by furin and PC5, and only about 1 % is cleaved by PC7 under identical conditions (Figure 2, Table 1). This amount of cleavage, though small, is still considered to be significant when compared to that observed in other similar systems.11, 17, 22\n",

The measured kinetic parameters are presented in Table 1. The amount of active enzyme (E\no) in each PC sample was determined with active\u2010site titration by using the covalent inhibitor Dec\u2010RVKR\u2010cmk, and by assuming that each PC enzyme was inactivated in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, as in the case of trypsin by TLCK (tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone).23 Our data show that among the three soluble PCs examined, furin was the most potent enzyme in cleaving QSARS\u20104 at the R761\u2193E site in vitro; the measured K\ncat/K\nm ratio for furin digestion was 92.4 \u03bcm\n\u22121 h\u22121. This was \u223c2.4 and 24.3\u2010fold better than the corresponding values for PC5 and PC7 digestions, respectively. It was further noted that the lowest K\nm value was obtained with furin; this suggests a stronger interaction between the substrate and QSARS\u20104. Moreover, the highest K\ncat value was obtained for PC5 and the lowest for PC7; this indicated a rapid and slow turnover for the two enzymes, respectively.",

This was confirmed by the gradual decrease in peak intensity of the CT\u2010cleaved fragment (t\nR=47.5 min) in the RP\u2010HPLC chromatogram as the amount of PC inhibitor \u03b11\u2010PDX gradually increased from 0 to 10 \u03bcm (Figure 4). This suggests that \u03b11\u2010PDX blocked the PC\u2010mediated cleavage of QSARS\u20104 peptide. The observed differences in the retention times of peptide peaks of this HPLC and that shown in Figure 2 were due to differences in the HPLC column type and the gradient method that was used. It was noted that 10 \u03bcm \u03b11\u2010PDX was almost sufficient to block furin\u2010mediated (0.2 U \u03bcL\u22121) cleavage of QSARS\u20104 peptide (40 \u03bcg) completely over a 2 h period.

            "text": "CD spectroscopy was performed on QSARS\u20104 peptide in aqueous medium at various concentrations to analyze the dependency of its secondary structure on concentration. As shown in Figure 5 A, the overall spectral profile did not change significantly with concentration; this suggests that the secondary structure of the peptide remained largely unchanged. As expected, only the peak intensity changed with concentration. Upon software analysis of the CD spectra, it was found that there was no helical structure present in the peptide at the concentrations used. QSARS\u20104 possessed a predominantly \u03b2 sheet structure with \u223c76 % content at 1 \u03bcg \u03bcL\u22121; this increased only marginally to \u223c80 % as the concentration was decreased to 0.25 \u03bcg \u03bcL\u22121. This occurred mostly at the expense of the random structure, which decreased from \u223c20 to \u223c15 % as the concentration of QSARS\u20104 decreased from 1 to 0.25 \u03bcg \u03bcL\u22121. In all of our subsequent digestion experiments, the concentration of QSARS\u20104 peptide was fixed at 1 \u03bcg \u03bcL\u22121 because the CD spectra at this concentration were strong enough for a good structural evaluation. Upon digestion of QSARS\u20104 (1 \u03bcg \u03bcL\u22121) for 30 min with increasing amounts of furin, the sheet content increased slightly, mainly at the expense of turn structures, and then remained more or less constant (Table 2). This was also displayed in overlay CD spectra (Figure 5 B). Even when the incubations were performed for a longer period of time, such as 4 h, not much change was noticed in the CD spectra. Thus, the most significant change occurred immediately following initial contact with furin. Further addition of furin did not seem to alter the CD spectra to any significant extent. The CD spectra shown in Figure 5 A or 5 B were the net spectra that were obtained following the subtraction of the appropriate control spectra. Our data indicate that even after a long period of digestion (4 h), the mixture of undigested QSARS\u20104 and its cleaved fragments still exhibited a predominantly sheet structure. The presence of a high sheet content in the peptide, as found by the CD studies was not in full agreement with the NMR results (vide infra) possibly because of the differences in the peptide concentrations, and other differing conditions that were used in the two studies (see the Experimental Section).",

The positions of various \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, aromatic and backbone NH amide protons are shown in http://www.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2268/2007/f700007_s.pdf in the Supporting Information. The amide \u03b1\u2010proton of N\u2010terminal glutamic acid (E1) was assigned to 8.56 ppm based on a ROESY correlation between this and the Abz aromatic ortho\u2010proton, to the glutamic acid amide (NH) proton (http://www.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2268/2007/f700007_s.pdf in the Supporting Information). Due to the similarity of TOCSY patterns (http://www.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2268/2007/f700007_s.pdf in the Supporting Information) for the spin systems that originate from the amide protons at 8.56 and 8.49 ppm, these two amino acids were assigned as glutamic acids E1 and E8, respectively. Analogously, the two\u2010spin systems that originate from the amide protons at 8.19 and 8.05 ppm were assigned as glutamines Q2 and Q12. The two glutamines (Q1 and Q12) and two arginines (R4 and R7) were distinguished based on ROESY correlations between the amide and \u03b1\u2010protons of the neighboring amino acids (http://www.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2268/2007/f700007_s.pdf in the Supporting Information). In addition to the assignments of all the amino\u2010acid protons, ROESY correlations between neighboring or distant amino acids are also listed in Figure 6, and are indicated by arrows between the interacting protons. Although there was significant overlap between some of the contours, based on the above assignments, ROESY correlations between 1) E1 and E8, 2) Q2 and V9 and E8, and 3) E8 and D3 indicate the presence of a bend in the peptide (Figure 6).

Soluble PC7 also cleaved the peptide, but with very poor efficiency. This was reflected in the very low K\ncat/K\nm value for PC7 compared to those for furin and PC5. Interestingly, the K\ncat and K\nm values were high for PC5 cleavage compared to furin cleavage, but the overall catalytic efficiency of furin based on the K\ncat/K\nm ratio was nearly 2.5\u2010fold better than that for PC5. These in vitro results indicate that PC5 and furin are the major host candidate enzymes involved in QSARS\u20104 cleavage.",

Therefore, PC inhibitors are likely to find important biochemical and therapeutic applications in some of these metabolic conditions. However, further studies with full\u2010length spike protein will be needed to examine its potential application in the study of SARS infection. Our previous study demonstrated that the other PC inhibitor, Dec\u2010RVKR\u2010cmk11 is able to diminish SARS viral infectivity in Vero E6 cell lines. In this regard, it will be of great interest to study and compare the ability of various other PC inhibitors, including small peptide and nonpeptide molecules28 to suppress SARS S protein processing and its consequences.",

Even though it is an in vitro assessment based on a model peptide, this study will be valuable for future investigation of the 3D crystal structure of full\u2010length S protein. In order to establish the relevance of our observations to physiological events, a theoretical analysis of the secondary structure of several segments of the hSARS spike protein were performed by using software (Peptide Companion) as well as web\u2010based programs (http://www.expasy.ch). These segments were selected from regions 731\u2013800, 741\u2013790, 751\u2013780, and 721\u2013810 of S protein, all of which contain the sequence 755\u2013766 that comprises QSARS\u20104 peptide. Based on the Chou\u2013Fasman conformational parameters for these polypeptides, it is predicted that there is a turn conformation within the 757DRNT760 segment, with a high conformation potential (magnitude 1.23). There is no preferred type of structure directly next to the turn on either side, although a few sheet and helical regions up\u2010 and downstream were noted.

After 30 min incubation with enzyme the \u03b2 sheet content of the peptide increased only slightly; however, after an extended period of time the percentage of \u03b2 sheet structure decreased. This suggests that as furin binds to QSARS\u20104 prior to cleavage, it promotes a structure with more \u03b2 sheet content. In contrast, as furin cleaved the peptide, there was overall less \u03b2 sheet structure. Even though these changes are small, they are still significant.",

Further studies with other viral glycoproteins will be required to confirm the general applicability of this hypothesis. The concept that SARS intervention might be feasible with PC or furin inhibitors is challenged by several observations that furin cleavage of the glycoprotein of the related Ebola virus is not important for in vitro infectivity and function.31, 32 This raises questions about the therapeutic potentials of furin inhibitors in SARS infection.",
