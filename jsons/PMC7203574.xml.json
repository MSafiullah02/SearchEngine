Years later it was discovered that the amino-terminal aspartate could be removed from ANG II to produce the heptapeptide ANG III, which had similar biological activities (67, 562). Finally, about three decades ago came the discovery that phenylalanine could be removed from the carboxy terminus of ANG II to produce another RAS peptide, ANG-(1\u20137) (45, 65, 85, 470, 492).",

This perception has changed mainly through the discovery that the ACE homolog ACE2 is often involved in its formation and that ANG-(1\u20137) acts on the G protein-coupled receptor MAS (468). ANG-(1\u20137) and ANG II usually have opposing effects, stimulating high interest because it suggests that ANG-(1\u20137) or other MAS agonists might be useful in the development of therapeutic agents to counteract the negative role of ANG II in many diseases.

            "text": "FIGURE 1 shows the main findings which contributed to the discovery of the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis as one of the main components of the RAS. In 1968, Yang, Erdos and Chiang (619) described the heptapeptide Des-Phe8-Angiotensin II, generated from ANG II as a route for the inactivation of ANG II. Tonnaer et al. (544) came to the same conclusion when he found this heptapeptide in brain synaptosomes. In 1988, Santos and colleagues examined tissue taken from dogs that had been treated with enalapril to determine how this affected the RAS in the brain (470). They incubated brain micro-punch homogenates with 125I-labeled ANG I and discovered a consistent formation of a radioactive peak they identified as 125I-ANG-(1\u20137). The peptide continued to form when they added an ACE inhibitor to the incubation. This meant that the ANG-(1\u20137) peptide was being formed from ANG I, but along a different route that bypassed ACE (470). The formation of 125I-ANG-(1\u20137) from 125I-ANG I was in keeping with an early observation made by Greene et al. (221) in whole rodent brain homogenates, who had interpreted ANG-(1\u20137) as the end point of an angiotensin inactivation pathway. Santos et al. (470) suggested instead that ANG-(1\u20137) might be another biologically active product of the RAS, achieved along this enzymatic pathway. The same year, Schiavone et al. (492) delivered proof through experiments with hypothalamus/hypophysial explants. The function they found for ANG-(1\u20137) in this preparation was to trigger the release of vasopressin (AVP), through dose-dependent effects that were just as potent as those of ANG II. In vivo confirmation came 1 yr later, when Campagnole-Santos et al. reported the first biological action of ANG-(1\u20137) in vivo (65). Microinjection of femtomole amounts of ANG-(1\u20137) in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) produced significant reductions in the blood pressure of urethane-anesthetized rats. This effect was similar to that produced by microinjection of ANG II in the same region. These exciting observations motivated Carlos Ferrario's group at Cleveland Clinic to produce an ANG-(1\u20137) antibody which was then used by Block et al. (45) to describe the localization of ANG-(1\u20137) immunoreactivity in the brain. In 1989, Chappell et al. (85) again using this antibody confirmed these findings. In 1994, we (473) and Amb\u00fchl et al. (17) described the first selective antagonist for ANG-(1\u20137), its analog d-Ala7-ANG-(1\u20137), synthetized by Prof. Mahesch Khosla, which we named A-779. Having a selective antagonist was critical in uncovering many of the physiological actions of ANG-(1\u20137) including its role in baroreflex modulation (66) and in the central control of blood pressure (183). The use of A-779 was also important in postulating that ANG-(1\u20137) had a specific receptor (183).",

ACE2 is a membrane-anchored carboxypeptidase, which is the product of an ancient duplication of ACE that underwent a fusion with collectrin. Its discovery was reported in two papers which appeared almost simultaneously in 2000 (140, 543). The first, by Tipnis et al. (543) reported on the ability of ACE2 to convert ANG II to ANG-(1\u20137) and thus identified it as the key ANG-(1\u20137) forming enzyme. The Donoghue et al. article (140) did not test ANG II as a substrate for ACE2; they identified several other substrates, such as des-Arg9-bradykinin, apelin, and neurotensin, and first reported ANG-(1\u20137) generation in a subsequent paper (570). Later the Turner group also discovered that the ectodomain of ACE2 can be shed from the membrane by ADAM17 (290). Interestingly, some years later it turned out that the carboxypeptidase activity is not the only function of the enzyme. Its collectrin domain serves as trafficking adaptor for the large amino acid transporter B(O)AT1, transferring it to the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the intestine (285). This translocation is essential for the uptake of several amino acids from food, and the absence of ACE2 leads to the depletion of some, particularly of tryptophan in the blood (242). Later ACE2 was also discovered to be the cellular receptor of the SARS coronavirus (309).",

However, this hypothesis was disproved through further studies on MAS signaling (15) and also cloning of the ANG II receptor AT1 in 1991 (382, 487). It was not until 2003 that we finally demonstrated the specific binding of ANG-(1\u20137) to Mas-transfected cells (479). The fact that this binding was abolished in kidney sections of Mas-deficient mice demonstrated that MAS is a receptor for the heptapeptide (479).",

This peptide can be generated by either decarboxylation of the Asp residue or through the catalytic action of ACE2 on ANG A (264), Ala1-ANG II. Functional studies in blood vessels (235, 297) and transfected cells (297) have provided evidence that the receptor for alamandine is the MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor D (MrgD). However, despite solid functional evidence that the effects of alamandine can be at least partially mediated through binding to MrgD, there is no direct radioligand binding data or other classical pharmacological data to fully demonstrate that MrgD has this function. Even so, alamandine has attracted attention as a potential mediator of the RAS.",

Other MAS ligands, the non-peptides AR234960 (agonist) and AR244555 (inverse agonist) and neuropeptide FF (NPFF) appear to act through a different signaling pathway in which ANG-(1\u20137) is essentially ineffective (276, 633).

This compound protects ANG-(1\u20137) from inactivation by digestive tract enzymes and permits oral administration (188, 332). It should be emphasized that in this case, only ANG-(1\u20137) enters the bloodstream. The inclusion compound acts as a sustained-release system or, more properly, as a long-lasting releasing system. This approach has led to the description of many beneficial cardiovascular and metabolic effects of ANG-(1\u20137), including antithrombogenesis (185), an attenuation of cardiac remodeling induced by isoproterenol treatment (347), a reduction of the lesion area, and an attenuation of acute and chronic postinfarction cardiac dysfunction (348). There have also been reports of antihypertensive effects (37) and improvements in cases of erectile dysfunction (187), muscular dystrophy (5a, 455), and type II diabetes mellitus (486). Some of the effects in preclinical studies have been remarkable considering that the peptide was given orally once a day in doses ranging from 10 to 50 \u03bcg/kg, which are equivalent to 11 to 55 nmol\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121.",

Interestingly, the vasorelaxation produced by cyclic ANG-(1\u20137) in aortic rings from Sprague-Dawley rats is only partially blocked by the MAS antagonist A-779 (281), whereas this effect is completely blocked by the ANG-(1\u20137) analog d-Pro7-ANG-(1\u20137), an ANG-(1\u20137)/alamandine antagonist (297).

            "text": "In addition to MAS agonists, recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) is currently being used in physiological/pharmacological studies and tests of its potential therapeutic use (241). Prof. Raizada's group has suggested another interesting possibility: to use ACE2 activators to alter the balance between the ACE/ANG II/ AT1R and the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axes. The group virtually screened its structure to identify small-molecule ACE2 activators (250). The first compound they found was the 1-[(2-dimethylamino)ethylamino]-4-(hydroxymethyl)-7-[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyloxy]-9H-xanthene-9-one, or XNT. Acute administration induced a dose-dependent hypotensive response in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), while long-term treatment with XNT improved cardiac function and reversed the cardiac and renal fibrosis in these animals (250). Oral administration of XNT was able to attenuate diabetes-induced heart dysfunction (381). XNT adminstration also prevented the increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and hypertrophy in a monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension model (169) and attenuated thrombus formation in SHR (190). Numerous protective effects have been reported with diminazene aceturate (DIZE), another putative ACE2 activator (102, 118, 119, 184, 186, 335, 341, 357, 429, 445, 511, 513, 535, 566). It should be pointed out, however, that the beneficial effects of these small-molecule activators might also depend on ACE2-independent mechanisms (234). And results obtained in rodents should be interpreted with caution considering the important differences between the biochemical properties of rodent and human ACE2 (622). Moreover, ACE2 can cleave other substrates (140), a fact which should be taken into account when interpreting results obtained with methods involving the gain or loss of ACE2 functions.",

            "text": "Based on the pleiotropic actions of this protein, mice lacking ACE2 are expected to exhibit increased levels of ANG II, and decreased levels of ANG-(1\u20137) and tryptophan as well as alterations in other peptide levels, all of which may contribute to the phenotypes that are observed. The X-chromosomal localization of the ACE2 gene makes male mice with ACE2 gene deletion already deficient in the enzyme in the hemizygous state (ACE2-/y). The first report on ACE2-/y mice described several cardiac abnormalities, particularly at older ages (104), which were later attributed to an increased effect of ANG II. However, other groups could not confirm these effects and the issue remained controversial (231, 232, 617). Notwithstanding, several studies report a higher susceptibility of ACE2-/y and heterozygous female ACE2+/\u2212 mice to cardiac injury induced by pressure overload or diabetes (410, 598, 617). Additional cardiovascular effects of ACE2 deletion remain under debate, including hypertension. Here the strain of mice that is used seems to be important. The 129 strain of mice lacking ACE2 is normotensive and C57BL/6 and FVB/N mice are hypertensive (232, 541) (our unpublished results). The hypertensive phenotype of ACE2-deficient mice on the C57BL/6 background is exacerbated in pregnancy, and they develop a preeclampsia-like syndrome (39). The main reason for increased blood pressure in ACE2-/y mice is probably endothelial dysfunction (327), but central effects including an increased sympathetic outflow cannot be excluded (605). Moreover, endothelial dysfunction may be involved in the aggravating effect of ACE2 deficiency in two models of atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)- and low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (397, 457, 537, 538), as well as in the increased neointima formation after vascular injury (457). ACE2-deficient mice also show a worse outcome in other inflammation and injury models, such as diabetic and shock-induced kidney injury (501, 598, 621), chronic hepatic injury (406), bleomycin- or influenza virus-induced lung injury (443, 648), and in models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (258). The lung injury phenotype could be rescued by infused mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing ACE2 (243). The unifying feature of most of the injury models is an increase in oxidative stress in ACE2-/y mice, which was recently confirmed for the kidney (603), liver (own unpublished results), and vessels (412, 431) of these animals.",

Nor is it known whether the generation of ANG peptides is solely dependent on brain angiotensinogen (Angiotensinogen), ACE, ACE2 and renin, taking into account discrepancies in the location of RAS components (23, 45, 56, 160, 224, 415). However, increasing evidence suggests that RAS generation is intracellular and includes the expression of intracellular ANG II and ANG-(1\u20137), as well as their respective receptors (87, 233, 289, 379). Krob et al. (286) demonstrated intense ANG-(1\u20137) immunostaining in hypothalamic neurons of TGR(mREN2)27 transgenic rats, suggesting an intracellular localization of the peptide. Further experiments have demonstrated an intracellular expression of ACE2 based on immunohistochemistry in different areas of the brain (142) and ANG-(1\u20137) expression in primary neuronal cell cultures from the hypothalamic-brain stem areas (209, 211, 325). Interestingly, studies using double transgenic mice that overexpress both human Angiotensinogen and renin in either glial or neuronal cells suggest that the source of ANG II may be both cell types. Moreover, glia-derived angiotensin peptides are responsible for impairments in the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) that controls heart rate (HR), whereas neuronal overexpression of angiotensin peptides resets the baroreceptor set point without altering BRS (458). Overexpression in both glial and neuronal cells contributes to increases in resting arterial pressure (379). On the other hand, rats that express an antisense RNA against Angiotensinogen under the control of the glial GFAP promoter indicates that the source of ANG-(1\u20137) is mainly non-glial cells (460).",

Additionally, ANG-(1\u20137) is efficiently generated directly from ANG II by the monocarboxypeptidase, ACE2, and prolyl carboxypeptidase (136, 211). Accordingly, it has been shown that ANG-(1\u20137) attenuates the ANG II pressor response in the hypothalamus, and concomitant injections of ANG II and A-779 increased the response, suggesting that ANG-(1\u20137) may be formed from ANG II, at least in the hypothalamus (256). It is interesting to point out that although ACE constitutes the major ANG II-forming pathway, it also degrades ANG-(1\u20137) in a way that leads to ANG-(1\u20135) (89). However, so far not a single brain cell has been detected that expresses all components of the RAS; thus the formation of bioactive forms of angiotensin might require interactions between multiple cell types, or, the brain possesses enzymatic mechanisms different from the classical ones which are responsible for the formation of neuroactive forms of angiotensins (115, 116, 574).",

Interestingly, ANG-(1\u20137) levels were found to be fivefold higher in hypophysial-portal plasma than in jugular plasma of normotensive sheep, while no differences were observed for ANG II, renin, or angiotensinogen (298). In addition, it was shown that ACE2, the major enzyme involved in ANG-(1\u20137) formation, is present in the brain, predominantly in neurons (142). ACE2 immunostaining is in fact widespread throughout the brain, from the telencephalon to the medulla, at least in the mouse (142).",

The first antagonistic effect of ANG-(1\u20137) was described on the modulation of the baroreflex (66). ANG-(1\u20137), given intracerebroventricularly (ICV), facilitated baroflex control, while ANG II attenuated it (66). Further studies have strengthened this hypothesis by showing that ANG-(1\u20137) binds with low affinity to AT1 and AT2 receptors (452) and that its central and peripheral effects are different from those induced by ANG II (159, 473).",

There was a strong staining in the NTS, caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla (CVLM and RVLM), inferior olive, parvo- and magnocellular portions of the PVN, SON, and lateral preoptic area (LPA) of normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. However, other areas also stained for MAS, such as the hippocampal nucleus, different subregions of the frontal cortex, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, basomedial and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus (nXII). In fact, MAS had already been recognized as an orphan receptor for some time and mRNA had been found in areas such as the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, and amygdala (58, 352, 369). In the murine brain, strong MAS protein expression was detected in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, within the piriform cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus (192). Recently, Regenhardt et al. (433) have shown MAS immunostaining mainly in the soma of neurons and microglia of the adult rat cerebral cortex but not in astroglia, and in both nonnuclear and nuclear compartments. We still do not know whether AT1, AT2, and MAS may have a degree of overlapping localization or are expressed in distinct neuronal populations.",

This effect was initially investigated through short-term infusions of ANG-(1\u20137) into the lateral ventricle. On the other hand, infusion of A-779 attenuated the baroreflex sensitivity of normotensive rats but did not significantly alter the depressed baroreflex sensitivity of SHR (249, 402), suggesting an overall imbalance of ANG formation or MAS expression in SHR. However, when SHR received an ICV infusion of an ACE inhibitor, baroreflex experienced a significant increase in sensitivity that could be completely prevented by ICV A-779 (249). Moreover, the improvement in baroreflex after oral treatment with an ACE inhibitor in Goldblatt two kidney-one clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats was also reversed by ICV infusions of A-779 (52), showing that ANG-(1\u20137) may at least partly contribute to the beneficial effects on baroreflex from ACE inhibitor treatments. Because ACE inhibitors also affect bradykinin metabolism, we showed that ICV infusions of subeffective doses of ANG-(1\u20137), combined with equally subeffective doses of bradykinin, significantly facilitated baroreflex bradycardia, an effect which could be completely blocked by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 or by A-779, suggesting an interaction of both peptides in modulating baroreflex gain (46).",

However, when long-term infusions (14\u201328 days) were performed, a chronic increase in ANG-(1\u20137) levels in the CNS strongly attenuated the increase in arterial pressure that is observed in DOCA-salt rats (226), TGR(mREN2)27 hypertensive rats (390), or in female rats (614) subjected to DOCA-salt or ANG II hypertension (613). Similar data were observed after the delivery of an ANG-(1\u20137) fusion protein at the cisterna magna of TGR(mREN2)27 hypertensive rats (197). Furthermore, the blood pressure-lowering effect of ANG-(1\u20137) in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was related to an improvement in baroreflex bradycardia, the restoration of the baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and a regaining of the balance of cardiac autonomic tone (226). These effects were blocked by A-779, once again suggesting a mediation by MAS (273). An enhancement of the baroreflex control of the RSNA was also observed after 4 days of ICV infusion of ANG-(1\u20137) in rabbits subjected to chronic heart failure (274) and in transgenic mice overexpressing human ACE2 selectively in the brain (154). Additionally, mice lacking MAS presented a marked imbalance in the neural control of blood pressure, with a blunted sensitivity of not only the baroreflex but also the chemo- and Bezold-Jarisch reflexes (125). It is interesting to observe that in pathophysiological conditions, such as aortic coarctation (209), TGR(mREN2)27 hypertensive transgenic rats (493) exhibit an increase in concentrations of ANG-(1\u20137) in the brain.",

Microinjections of ANG-(1\u20137) induce facilitation, while injections of ANG II produce attenuation of the baroreflex bradycardia (90, 133). Accordingly, A-779 and losartan, selective MAS and AT1 receptor antagonists, produce opposite effects on the baroreflex in normotensive or hypertensive rats (90, 135, 460). At this site ANG-(1\u20137), which can be at least partially derived from ANG II through ACE2 (136), is degraded by ACE (259) and may have a preferential non-glial source (103, 460). Moreover, decreased levels of ANG-(1\u20137) at the NTS may be related to the attenuated baroreflex control that is observed in hypertension and aging (20, 90, 133, 249, 389, 459).",

More strikingly, alongside these cardiovascular improvements, the rats presented normalized glucose tolerance, glycemia, insulinemia, and HOMA score.

In agreement with this interpretation, a selective overexpression of ACE2 in the RVLM (618) or PVN (635) induces a significant decrease in blood pressure of SHR (618), attenuation of sympathetic activity, and improvement of the baroreflex function in animals with congestive heart failure (635).",

            "text": "At selective medullary sites, the acute stimulation of MAS induces effects similar to those triggered by ANG II (12, 14, 17, 26, 31, 64, 65, 103, 133, 170, 171, 180, 182, 183, 210, 297, 403, 425, 492, 506). In the NTS, ANG-(1\u20137) induces neuronal excitation (26) and decreases baseline blood pressure in normotensive (65) and hypertensive rats (90, 135). In the CVLM, an inhibitory area participating in the baroreflex arch (595), ANG-(1\u20137) induces decreases in mean arterial pressure similar to those observed for ANG II (13, 14, 69, 170, 581). However, the hypotensive effect of ANG-(1\u20137) was blocked by A-779, while ANG II was inhibited by losartan (475). Wang et al. (581) showed that the depressor response to ANG-(1\u20137) in the CVLM was accompanied by an increased release of glutamate and a decrease in taurine. More interestingly, we showed that the signaling mechanisms triggered by these peptides at the CVLM were distinct. ANG-(1\u20137) acts through a nitrergic pathway sensible to the NOS inhibitors, l-NAME and 7-NI, while ANG II acts preferably by decreasing the noradrenergic drive (14). Also in contrast to ANG II, microinjections of ANG-(1\u20137) into the CVLM attenuated the bradycardia and facilitated the baroreflex tachycardia (13). These effects were completely abolished by intravenous methyl-atropine, showing a dependence of a cholinergic/nitrergic peripheral mechanism (13). In SHR, the hypotensive effect of these peptides reaches a similar magnitude but involves the participation of different vascular beds (170). The hypotensive effect produced by ANG-(1\u20137) and ANG II at CVLM was caused by a decrease in renal vascular resistance, but did not alter femoral vascular resistance as shown for ANG-(1\u20137) in normotensive rats (170). This suggests a possible impairment of vasodilatory mechanisms triggered by ANG-(1\u20137) in the CVLM of SHR to the hindlimb. In 2K1C rats, the CVLM BP effect of ANG-(1\u20137) is mediated by MAS. However, A-779 at the CVLM of renovascular hypertensive rats induced a fall in BP and improved baroreflex bradycardia (69).",

MAS is expressed in the RVLM (29, 30) and microinjections of ANG-(1\u20137) induce a pressor response whose magnitude is similar to that of ANG II (172, 182, 183, 308, 316, 506, 640). Conversely, the selective blockade of endogenous ANG-(1\u20137) actions by A-779 results in a decrease in BP in normotensive (24, 180, 182, 315) and hypertensive rats (143, 172, 180, 307, 308, 388). The ANG-(1\u20137) pressor effect at the RVLM is increased after hemorrhage (316) and in hypertensive rats (172, 388). In keeping with the excitatory role of ANG-(1\u20137) after acute injections, A-779 or an inhibition of ACE2 with DX600 induces greater decreases in blood pressure in SHR (388) and TGR(mREN2)27 rats (180). In addition, RVLM microinjections of ANG-(1\u20137) induce an increase in RSNA in normotensive (425, 640) and renovascular hypertensive rats (307). Although ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS at this site does not alter baroreflex (13), it increases the cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR), which contributes to sympathetic excitation in hypertension (307, 388, 640). The facilitation of CSAR seems to be mediated by MAS activation of cAMP-protein kinase A and increases in NAD(P)H oxidase activity and the superoxide anion level (307, 308).",

Interestingly, in astrocytes from newborn SHRs, MAS mediates ANG-(1\u20137)-driven increases in Ca2+ signaling (228). On the other hand, A-779 but not the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan inhibited [Ca2+]i elevations induced by ANG-(1\u20137), which could also be antagonized by blocking intracellular Ca2+ stores (228). ANG-(1\u20137) evoked no consistent changes in [Ca2+]i or membrane excitability in catecholaminergic or noncatecholaminergic neurons of slice cultures containing the RVLM in either SHR or WKY (228). Recently, in an evaluation of the peripheral mechanism involved in the ANG-(1\u20137) effect at the RVLM, we showed that its pressor response may involve an increase in sympathetic tone, the release of AVP and possibly the inhibition of a vasodilatory peripheral mechanism (403).",

            "text": "All the excitatory effects described above counter the hypothesis that ANG-(1\u20137) plays a counterregulatory role to ANG II and mediates a decrease in blood pressure, improvement in baroreflex, decrease in sympathetic tone, and increase in vagal tone to the periphery. These effects were triggered by acute injections of ANG-(1\u20137) or antagonists into the RVLM. However, inducing a long-term alteration of RAS peptides at this site led to specific results which are informative. Stress-induced hypertension, for instance, induces increases in the expression of ACE and AT1, a decrease in ACE2, and a hyperresponsiveness of the RVLM to ANG II (143). Moderate physical exercise during SHR development (7\u201323 wk old) attenuates hypertension, prevents increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, ACE, and AT1 expression in the RVLM and upregulates IL-10, ACE2, and MAS at this site (6). In addition, these changes are associated with reductions in plasma ANG II levels, neuronal activity, NADPH-oxidase subunit gp91(phox), and inducible NOS in trained SHRs, all of which indicate reduced oxidative stress (6). Accordingly, exercise rescues ACE2 expression in the RVLM of animals subjected to heart failure (275). Exercise training in normotensive rats, on the other hand, induces a pressor response to A-779, suggesting that in this condition, endogenous ANG-(1\u20137) triggers the inhibition of pressor neurons at the RVLM (31). Nevertheless, the most striking result was obtained with lentivirus-mediated long-term ACE2 expression in the RVLM, which induced a significant and long-term reduction in blood pressure in SHR (618). This suggests that increasing the level of ANG-(1\u20137) may contribute to the anti-hypertensive effects of exercise training, at least in the RVLM.",

This effect, which was blocked by A-779, was in contrast to the excitatory effect induced by ANG II in control and pressoreceptor-denervated rats. More interesting, ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure after microinjections into the AH of denervated rats, an effect that is blocked by A-779 (252). This suggests that the effect of ACE inhibition is due to the formation of ANG-(1\u20137), which increases in this condition.",

(427) confirmed the first study performed in neurohypophysial explants by Schiavone et al. (492), showing that ANG-(1\u20137) microinjections into the PVN induce a release of AVP. However, in this study ANG-(1\u20137) was much less potent and its effect was abolished by losartan (AT1 antagonist) and PD123319 (antagonist for AT2 and MrgD). More recently, Whitaker and Molina (593) studied hemodynamic alterations after hemorrhagic shock in a model of acute ethanol intoxication. They found a reduction in the release of AVP mediated by a decrease in central NO inhibitory tone. The decrease in AVP release is considered the main factor in aggravating hemodynamic instability in animals with ethanol intoxication that suffer hemorrhages. These authors further showed an increase in ACE2 activity and ANG-(1\u20137) and substantial MAS-mediated upregulation of NOS in PVN of acute ethanol intoxicated hemorrhaged animals. A blockade of MAS ICV or in the PVN partially restored circulatory levels of AVP, suggesting that NO upregulation mediated by ANG-(1\u20137) contributes to inhibitory tone upon AVP release during hemorrhaging in acute ethanol intoxication (593). Although these studies point to contrasting effects of ANG-(1\u20137) on the release of AVP, together they strengthen the concept that distinct ANG-(1\u20137) effects can be observed in specific brain areas depending on the existing pathophysiological condition.",

More recently, A-779 injections into the PVN have been shown to attenuate hypertension induced by a sleep apnea model in rats (108), which agrees with the sympathetic stimulatory effect of acute injections of ANG-(1\u20137) into the PVN. Nevertheless, ANG-(1\u20137) injections into the PVN effectively increased the RSNA, CSAR, and arterial pressure through an activation of MAS via the cAMP-PKA pathway (237, 307, 308, 527, 640). However, these studies were performed in anesthetized vagotomized and sinoaortic denervated rats, a condition that may introduce important changes in the activity of PVN neurons and their sensitivity to neuromodulators. For instance, others have reported opposite trends in other models (409, 413, 635)",

Hellner et al. (246) were the first to show that ANG-(1\u20137) enhances LTP in limbic structures, implicating a distinct function in learning and memory mechanisms via MAS. In 2007, Albrecht (7) showed that the LTP modulatory effect of ANG-(1\u20137) working through MAS in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala depended on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and NO. Moreover, Staschewski et al. (518) showed that there is a gender-dependent involvement of different isoforms of NOS in the effects of ANG-(1\u20137) on LTP in the amygdala. The ANG-(1\u20137)-induced increase in the magnitude of LTP involves nNOS in males and eNOS in females (518). In CA1 region of the hippocampus, Lazaroni et al. (299) showed that mice without MAS or subjected to MAS blockade present impaired object recognition memory (ORM). In addition, in Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice, ANG-(1\u20137) concentrations are increased in the whole hippocampus, as well as in the CA1 area, suggesting the need for a functional ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis for normal ORM processing (299). Interestingly, it has been reported that in this brain region ANG-(1\u20137) can be formed independent of ANG II processing (417). Despite this evidence, the role of ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis in limbic-dependent memories remains poorly understood.",

Accordingly, years later Bild and Ciobica (43) showed an anxiolytic-like effect after chronic ICV infusions of ANG-(1\u20137), accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress in the amygdala. More recently, using two different transgenic rat lines, we showed that ANG-(1\u20137) ICV infusions could attenuate anxiety-like behavior (11, 272). In addition, we showed that ANG-(1\u20137) was also effective in attenuating a depression-like phenotype (11). Interestingly, hypertensive patients who suffer from depression exhibit mood improvements after treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril, which increases levels of ANG-(1\u20137) (50). Recently, we showed that the anxiety-like behavior of hypertensive rats was rescued in enalapril-treated animals after blockade, unveiling an anti-aversive role for endogenous ANG-(1\u20137), at least in hypertensive rats (11). More recently, similar findings have been obtained in mice by increasing ACE2 activity (583).",

Fontes and colleagues (181, 353, 404) have suggested that the ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis is a promising target to attenuate the physiological response to emotional stress and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. ANG-(1\u20137) given in the lateral ventricle (353) or microinjected into the basolateral amygdala (404), an area of the limbic system that is involved in coordinating emotional responses, markedly attenuated the pressor and tachycardia responses evoked by air jet stress, a model to study cardiovascular changes to acute stress. Additionally, ANG-(1\u20137) injections into basolateral amygdala also attenuated the pressor response evoked by the cage-switch stress paradigm, another model of acute psychosocial stress (404). These effects were blocked by A-779, suggesting that they are MAS-mediated (353, 404). These findings reinforce the concept that ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS can modulate the cardiovascular responses evoked by emotional stress and point to the basolateral amygdala as an important site for mediating these actions.",

More recently, these authors showed a decrease in ANG-(1\u20137) levels and an attenuation in MAS-nNOS pathways in the PAG of rats with chronic heart failure (609). Moreover, ANG-(1\u20137)'s ability to attenuate the neuronal activity of the dorsolateral PAG was significantly decreased in chronic heart failure animals (609). Whether the inhibitory effects of ANG-(1\u20137) at PAG are involved in modulating responses of emotional stress is an open question; however, it is very likely considering the role of the PAG in controlling sympathetic and cardiovascular system.",

These data were corroborated and extended by others, who showed an involvement of NO and different NOS isoforms, a decrease in cytokines, and a reduction in NF\u03baB, COX-2, ROS, and neuronal apoptosis (267, 268, 421, 422, 637). The anti-inflammatory effects of central administrations of ANG-(1\u20137) were in accordance with the demonstration of a decrease in the activation of microglia both in ischemic stroke (433) and in hemorrhagic stroke induced in SHR-SP (434). All of these effects were attenuated by A-779, but were unaffected by the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319, pointing to MAS as the receptor involved (526).",

Nevertheless, treatment with an ACE2 activator after stroke induces a decreased infarct volume and improves neurological functions without significant changes in cerebral blood flow (357). Accordingly, ACE2 overexpression in neurons of transgenic mice that overexpress human renin and Angiotensinogen (SARA, triple transgenic mice) induced neuroprotection, as demonstrated by a reduction in MCAO-induced infarct volume, an increase in cerebral blood flow, attenuation of neurological deficits, and increases in cerebral microvascular density in the peri-infarct area (636). These effects were MAS-related and independent of baseline arterial pressure. Moreover, there were increases in the ANG-(1\u20137)/ANG II ratio, angiogenic factors, eNOS expression, and NO production, whereas levels of NADPH oxidase subunits and ROS were decreased in the brain of SARA mice (636). The counterbalancing effect of ANG-(1\u20137) in the presence of high levels of ANG II was also observed in hemorrhagic stroke (42).",

Strategies aimed at rescuing the RAS balance and inducing an increase in ANG-(1\u20137) in the brain can help ameliorate the problems that arise as these diseases develop. Physical exercise is an effective, nonpharmacological strategy to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients, improving cognitive function, attenuating depression, and demonstrating other effects. Recent studies have shown that physical exercise induces changes in RAS components that lead to an increase in ACE2 activity and ANG-(1\u20137) in the brain in animals with heart failure or arterial hypertension (81, 275). Future studies will be necessary to reveal the mechanisms involved in exercise-triggered alteration in RAS components in the brain and their role in the beneficial effects of exercise.",

These authors showed that ANG-(1\u20137) acting induces a decrease in presynaptic norepinephrine (NE) release in hypothalamus isolated from normotensive (214) and SHR (213) both by direct action or by blocking the release of ANG II-stimulated NE, thus balancing the stimulatory action of ANG II. They also showed that the decrease in NE release through ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS activation leads to bradykinin generation, which stimulates the B2 receptor and enhances NO release, activating the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway (215). In agreement, Feng and colleagues (154, 634) showed that the overexpression of ACE2 produces a significant increase in brain NO production, as do ICV administrations of ANG-(1\u20137). The activation of cGMP/PKG signaling in turn inhibits voltage-dependent calcium channels or induces the phosphorylation of proteins of the synaptic vesicle, decreasing the release of neurotransmitters and thus lowering their levels at the synaptic cleft. Additionally, it was shown that ANG-(1\u20137) decreases tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and expression, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, in neurons from the hypothalamus and brain stem of WKY and SHR (325). This effect was unrelated to MAS, but blocked by PD123319, which led the authors to conclude that ANG-(1\u20137) acts via AT2 receptor activation, to stimulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system; this, in turn, induces increases in TH degradation. However, the recent finding that PD123319 also inhibits MrgD (297) means that the reduction in TH activity could be due to alamandine, a possibility yet to be explored.",

ANG-(1\u20137) does not alter acute NE neuronal uptake in the hypothalamus of SHR (212). However, through MAS, ANG-(1\u20137) induces both MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways, resulting in increase in NE transporter transcription and translation (326). This suggests that ANG-(1\u20137) induces a long-term stimulatory effect on NE uptake by augmenting levels of the transporter. In addition to NE, Stragier et al. (523) showed that ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS stimulated the release of GABA and dopamine, but not of glutamate, in the rat striatum. In contrast, ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS stimulation in the CVLM induces an increase in the release of glutamate and a decrease in taurine (581). Thus a site-specific regulation of levels of synaptic neurotransmitters may be an alternative mechanism by which ANG-(1\u20137) contributes to the control of various functions in a range pathophysiological conditions through MAS.",

On the other hand, chronic exposure to ANG-(1\u20137) or genetic deletion of MAS has significant effects on Ca2+-handling proteins (217, 476). Transgenic rats harboring an ANG-(1\u20137)-producing fusion protein in the heart show an increased Ca2+ transient amplitude, faster Ca2+ uptake, and increased expression of SERCA2 (217). Cardiomyocytes from Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice have a smaller peak Ca2+ transient and a slower uptake of Ca2+, probably due to the decreased expression of SERCA2 (217). These changes translated into impaired heart functions in Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice (48, 198, 476). The changes in calcium-handling proteins were paralleled by changes in the NO production machinery (130). Cardiomyocytes from Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice have normal eNOS protein levels, but a 70% increase in caveolin-3 expression and a decrease in heat shock protein 90 (117, 130). These two alterations may induce a decrease in eNOS activity because caveolin-3 prevents interactions between calmodulin and NOS, and heat shock protein 90 acts as a scaffold protein to recruit protein kinase B (AKT) to the eNOS complex (602).",

This was in contrast to the pro-arrhythmogenic effects of ANG-(1\u20137) at 10-fold higher concentrations (393). In keeping with these observations, De Mello et al. (124) reported a biphasic effect of ANG-(1\u20137) on impulse propagation and cardiac arrhythmias: at 10 nM, an anti-arrhythmogenic effect was observed (466), whereas at a 10-fold higher concentration, ANG-(1\u20137) was pro-arrhythmogenic (124). In transgenic TGR(A1\u20137)3292 rats which presented a moderate increase in circulating ANG-(1\u20137), a reduction in the duration of reperfusion cardiac arrhythmias and improved postischemic heart functions were observed (466). The mechanism of the anti-arrhythmogenic effect of ANG-(1\u20137) seems to involve, at least in part, the sodium pump (124).",

(565) reported a dramatic deleterious effect of ANG-(1\u20137) infusions in SD rats after 5/6 nephrectomy. However, opposite effects were reported by Li et al. in the mouse (311) and, more recently, Xu et al. in the rat (610). In their studies, ANG-(1\u20137) prevented heart dysfunctions and left ventricular remodeling. Additional studies are needed to clarify this issue. It would be interesting, for example, to remove interfering factors such as the action of ANG-(1\u20137) on AT1 receptors in this condition (468). In a contrasting report, Zhang et al. (633) showed that the overexpression of human MAS in rat cardiomyocytes leads to hypertrophy. In addition to the possibility that the overexpressed receptors might be uncoupled from the usual signaling machinery activated by endogenous receptors, these data and other studies of ANG-(1\u20137) (393) indicate that important differences in signaling may arise in conditions where levels of MAS or ANG-(1\u20137) rise well above physiological concentrations.",

ANG-(1\u20137) and MAS are expressed in VSMCs (530) and platelets (189). The antiproliferative action of ANG-(1\u20137) in the vasculature has been demonstrated in VSMCs, in which ANG-(1\u20137) reduces the ANG II-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities of ERK1/2 through an increase in prostacyclin (PGI2) (530). A concurring result was observed in a rat stenting model, where ANG-(1\u20137) treatment produced a significant reduction in neointimal thickness, neointimal area, and stenosis (292). In rats with vascular calcification, ANG-(1\u20137) restored the decreased expression of lineage markers in VSMCs, including smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, SM22\u03b1, calponin, and smoothelin, and retarded the osteogenic transition of these cells by reducing the expression of bone-associated proteins (525).

Interestingly, the vasodilator effect of ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS is selective for specific vascular beds, contrasting with the more widespread vasoconstriction described for ANG II/AT1. In normotensive rats, ANG-(1\u20137) produced marked changes on regional blood flow, increasing vascular conductance in the mesenteric, cerebral, cutaneous, and renal territories. Furthermore, ANG-(1\u20137) simultaneously increases cardiac output (CO) by 30% and decreases total peripheral resistance (TPR) by 26%. These opposing changes lead to an absence of substantial changes in blood pressure (462). Similarly, transgenic rats with a slight increase in circulating ANG-(1\u20137) over their lifetime, TGR(A1\u20137)3292, present pronounced changes in regional blood flow, resulting in an increase in vascular conductance in the kidneys, lungs, adrenals, spleen, brain, testis, and brown fat tissue. In contrast, Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice show a marked increase in vascular resistance in many territories such as the kidney, lung, adrenal gland, mesentery, spleen, and brown adipose tissue.

The relative phosphorylation state of Ser1177 and Thr495 determines the activity of eNOS in endothelial cells (176). ANG-(1\u20137) increases Ser1177 phosphorylation while simultaneously decreasing the phosphorylation of Thr495; both posttranslational effects are blocked by the MAS antagonist A-779 (461). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the ANG-(1\u20137)-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT counteracts the negative effects of ANG II on insulin signaling in endothelial cells and is involved in the survival and proliferation of CD34(+) cells from diabetic individuals (536).

This modulatory effect is mediated by the phosphorylation of SHP-2, preventing ANG II-induced SHP-2 dephosphorylation and promoting interactions between SHP-2 and c-Src. A-779 inhibited these actions, demonstrating that these effects are mediated through MAS (463). In keeping with this concept, the impairment of endothelial function in two different genetic backgrounds with MAS deficiencies, C57Bl/6 and FVB/N, indicates a crucial role of MAS in endothelial functions through its effects on the generation and metabolism of NO and ROS (430, 611). In the FVB/N background, endothelial dysfunction is associated with an increase in blood pressure (611), whereas in C57BL/6 mice, no alteration of blood pressure has been reported (430). A worsening of 2K1C Goldblatt hypertension has also been observed in Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice (432). Conversely, short-term infusions of ANG-(1\u20137) improve endothelial functions, significantly increasing the hypotensive effects of administering intra-arterial acetylcholine in normotensive rats (151). In diet-induced obesity mice, chronic treatments with ANG-(1\u20137) induced a significant improvement in endothelial functions and reversed the elevated aortic expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunits p22(phox) and p47(phox) and plasma TBARS (38). Similar results were obtained in diabetic rats, in which the carotid blood flow was restored by chronic treatment with ANG-(1\u20137), probably through the MAS-mediated antioxidant effects that oppose AT1-activated NAD(P)H oxidase (420). Moreover, ANG-(1\u20137) also negatively regulates the ANG II-induced expression of VCAM-1 by attenuating the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB in endothelial cells (630).",

            "text": "The actions of ANG-(1\u20137) in human vasculature still require investigation to determine whether the potent vasodilator effect described in rodents applies. Although an initial examination focused on human vessels led to some controversy, the conflicting results could be due to methodological divergences, or a racial or vascular territory selectivity of ANG-(1\u20137). The infusion of ANG-(1\u20137) in patients chronically treated with ACE inhibitors had no effect on forearm blood flow, whereas the infusion of bradykinin produced a noticeable vasodilation (114). This observation was taken as evidence that ANG-(1\u20137) played no role in the hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. However, this did not consider the fact that ACE inhibition significantly increases circulating levels of ANG-(1\u20137), which means that using a MAS antagonist rather than ANG-(1\u20137) would have been more suitable to evaluate the peptide's effects on blood flow. Similar negative results were obtained in the forearm blood flow of normotensive patients, in which ANG-(1\u20137) did not alter vasodilation produced by bradykinin infusion (596). In contrast, Sasaki et al. (488) observed a dose-dependent vasodilation in the forearm circulation in normotensive subjects and patients with essential hypertension. Ueda et al. (548) similarly reported a dose-dependent potentiation of bradykinin vasodilation by ANG-(1\u20137) in normotensive forearm resistance vessels of normotensive healthy men, which is in keeping with the well-known bradykinin-potentiating activity of ANG-(1\u20137) described in animal models (10, 53, 156, 467). An attenuation of the vasoconstrictor effect of ANG II, but not of NE, by ANG-(1\u20137) was described in the forearm of normotensive patients as well as in mammary arteries in vitro (451, 488). ANG-(1\u20137) also antagonized ANG II in renal vessels in vitro, but does not appear to have a pronounced effect in normal physiological regulation of renal vascular function in vivo (450). More recently, Van Twist et al. (560) observed a significant dose-dependent increase in blood flow to the kidney during intrarenal infusions of ANG-(1\u20137) in hypertensive patients. Interestingly, like the observation made in rat renal vessels (555), this effect was weakened in patients on a low-salt diet, probably because this diet leads to an increase in circulating angiotensin peptides including ANG-(1\u20137) (282). The same authors (560) demonstrated that the effect of ANG-(1\u20137) infusion on renal blood flow was also reduced in stenotic kidneys. Mendon\u00e7a et al. (359) have recently demonstrated that ANG-(1\u20137) significantly attenuates ANG II-induced vasoconstriction in human mammary arteries from patients submitted to coronary revascularization, probably through direct effects on smooth muscle cells, since this action was not abolished by A-779, PD123177, or endothelium removal.",

The blockade of cyclooxygenase had no effect on ANG-(1\u20137) action (437). Evidence for vasodilator action in vivo was provided by Sampaio et al. using fluorescent microspheres (462). Other approaches did not lead to any direct effects of the heptapeptide on the renal vasculature in vivo despite in vitro activity (TABLE 1). This latter observation has led to skepticism regarding the biological significance of ANG-(1\u20137) in vivo (57). However, more recent studies in humans clearly indicate that ANG-(1\u20137) promotes vasodilation in human kidneys, a phenomenon that is influenced by the Na+ balance (560) or by the presence of renal artery stenosis (559).",

            "text": "Although little is known concerning the physiological roles of the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis in the lung, it appears to be critically involved in pathophysiological processes in this organ. ANG-(1\u20137) has been reported to reduce lung inflammation, fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (92, 310, 333, 338, 364, 445, 449, 576). MAS has been detected in the epithelium and bronchial smooth muscle, suggesting sites where the beneficial actions of ANG-(1\u20137) may occur (148, 338). Anti-inflammatory actions of ANG-(1\u20137) were first described in a model of allergic asthma by El-Hashim et al. (148). The authors demonstrate that treatments with ANG-(1\u20137) resulted in the inhibition of the ovalbumin-induced increase in total cell counts, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils as well as significantly reductions in ovalbumin-induced perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, fibrosis, and goblet cell hyper/metaplasia. These effects were mediated via MAS and blocked by A-779. ANG-(1\u20137) further reduced ovalbumin-induced increases in phosphorylation levels of ERK 1/2 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 and also inhibited the phytohemagglutinin-stimulated proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBMC). In chronic asthma, ANG-(1\u20137) triggered the beneficial attenuation of three major characteristics of this disease: lung inflammation, airway remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness (338). Similar effects were achieved in a model using the ANG-(1\u20137) mimetic compound AVE 0991 (449). The molecular mechanisms involved in these anti-inflammatory actions include a reduction of NF\u03baB-related signaling, reductions of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, and cytokine modulation (reducing IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 and increasing IL-10) (312, 363) (see FIGURE 7). The pulmonary activity of ACE and ACE2 activity becomes imbalanced in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by an enhancement in ACE activity, the main pathway to ANG-(1\u20137) degradation, combined with a reduction in the activity of ACE2, which mainly generates it (598a). Experimental models of acute lung injury have highlighted an important protective role for ANG-(1\u20137). Infusions protected rats from acute lung lesions after oleic acid administration as seen through a decrease in lung edema, myeloperoxidase activity, histological lung injury score, and pulmonary vascular resistance (280). Similar results were observed in a pulmonary injury model based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (92). ANG-(1\u20137) treatment also decreases the severity of lung damage and inflammation induced by a combination of acid aspiration and high stretch ventilation. Moreover, continuous infusions of ANG-(1\u20137) reduced lung fibrosis 2 wk after acid aspiration injury, indicating its potential use in therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (626). The signaling mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the ACE2/ANG (1\u20137)/MAS axis against lung fibroblast migration and lung fibrosis seem to involve the inhibition of the NOX4-derived ROS-mediated RhoA/Rock pathway (363). In addition to its protective actions in pulmonary inflammatory progression, ANG-(1\u20137) also regulates cell survival, inhibiting alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis, a critical event that initiates and propagates lung fibrotic disease. It decreases AEC apoptosis through pathways including the inhibition of JNK activation (312), reduction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis (549), inhibition of LPS-induced ADAM17 shedding activity (333), and the upregulation of MAPK phosphatase-2 (219). Altogether, these findings indicate that this peptide may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of lung fibrosis.",

            "text": "Since the demonstration of the beneficial effects of the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by Shenoy et al. (497), emerging evidence has suggested that ANG-(1\u20137) has a protective role in this condition (498). Its importance in PAH comes from the observation that in patients with PAH from congenital heart disease, the peptide is reduced in plasma (110). The significant smaller response shown by TGR(mREN2)27 rats than SD to chronic hypoxia was related to the increased expression of ACE2 in the lung, leading to ACE2 activity and especially to markedly increased lung ANG-(1\u20137) concentrations and MAS expression in this strain (236). Interestingly, treatments with DIZE, a putative ACE2 activator, protect rats from monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH and reverse the imbalance in the autonomic nervous system modulation elicited by PAH, increasing parasympathetic and decreasing sympathetic cardiac activation (445). Although the administration of ANG-(1\u20137) and cyclic ANG-(1\u20137) immediately after induction of PAH in rats demonstrated no superiority of the MAS agonists compared with conventional treatments, the route of administration as well as the high doses used, which may have effects via AT1 receptors, suggest caution in interpreting the authors' conclusions (51). On the other hand, these results are important in designing future evaluations of the therapeutic potential of ANG-(1\u20137) for PAH treatment. Remarkable recent results from the Touyz group demonstrated that ANG-(1\u20137) negatively modulates the pro-inflammatory signaling of endothelin-1, a powerful pro-fibrotic mediator and vasoconstrictor that is elevated in PAH (255). This protective effect involves a crosstalk between MAS and the ETB receptor. These data identify the endothelin system as a novel molecular mechanism involved in the putative protective actions of ANG-(1\u20137) in PAH and illustrate the need for more studies to clarify the therapeutic usefulness of MAS agonists in this area.",

            "text": "The presence of ANG-(1\u20137) in the ovary was initially described by Costa et al. in 2003 (100). These authors also were the first to suggest an involvement of the ANG-(1\u20137) peptide in pre- and postovulatory events, demonstrating higher levels of ANG-(1\u20137) in the proestrus and estrus as well as in equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)-treated rats (254). Later, the same group demonstrated that the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis is fully expressed in rat ovaries (419) and in all stages of follicular development in humans (436). ANG-(1\u20137) also plays a role in the ovulatory process, stimulating estradiol production and enhancing ovulatory efficiency. The specific ANG-(1\u20137) antagonist A-779 blocked these effects (569). Additionally, ANG-(1\u20137) promotes meiotic resumption in follicle-enclosed oocytes (FEOs), and gonadotropins upregulate the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis. A-779 reduced the percentage of germinal vesicle breakdown in luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated FEOs, suggesting that ANG-(1\u20137) participates in oocyte maturation as a gonadotropin intermediate (254). In addition to this action in ovaries, the expression of ANG-(1\u20137) in rat longitudinal myometrium and uterine serosa may indicate that the peptide is important for muscle physiology (563). Interestingly, ovarian steroids are not required for the endometrial expression of ANG-(1\u20137) in rats, since it remains abundant in ovariectomized animals. However, estrogen and progestin may modulate the distribution pattern of ANG-(1\u20137) in endometrial glands, where this peptide participates in the regulation of the endometrial response to ovarian steroids (563).",

(367) were the first to demonstrate an increase in plasma ANG-(1\u20137) in normal pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women; they also found decreased levels of ANG-(1\u20137) in preeclamptic compared with normal pregnant women. Velloso et al. (567) also found a significant reduction in plasma ANG-(1\u20137) levels, as well as a significantly higher plasma ACE activity and a marked reduction in plasma renin activity in preeclamptic women, especially in patients presenting the ACE deletion polymorphism deletion/deletion (DD) genotype. In contrast, ANG II levels in the plasma of preeclamptic women did not differ from those of normotensive pregnant subjects (567). Pregnancy-induced increases of plasma ANG-(1\u20137) are also blunted in gestational diabetes (399). Following iontophoretic applications of ANG-(1\u20137), normotensive pregnant women exhibited a higher change in skin flow compared with preeclamptic women (616). Women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia had increased ANG-(1\u20137) levels at 15 wk of gestation compared with women with normal pregnancies, suggesting that levels of ANG-(1\u20137) during early gestation could be useful indicators in predicting a woman's risk of developing hypertension during pregnancy (528).",

            "text": "Regarding the expression of ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis components in human placentas of normal and pathological pregnancies, syncytial ANG-(1\u20137) expression in samples obtained from pathological placentas was higher than those from normal-term pregnancies. In the maternal stroma, ANG-(1\u20137) and ACE2 expression was found in the invading and intravascular trophoblast and in decidual cells. Furthermore, ANG-(1\u20137) and ACE2 are expressed in arterial and venous endothelium and smooth muscle of the umbilical cord. The expression of ACE2 is increased in umbilical arterial endothelium in preeclampsia (550). Preeclamptic women also exhibit an imbalance of local RAS in the chorionic villous in the placenta, where it is responsible for the regulation of fetal oxygen and nutrient transport. In association with the upregulation of angiotensinogen and the AT1 receptor, a significant increase in ANG II was observed, but there was no accompanying increase in ANG-(1\u20137) and a decrease in MAS (19). In the uteroplacental unit of pregnant rats, the distribution profile of ANG-(1\u20137) and ACE2 expression differs during early stages of pregnancy (decidua, luminal, and glandular epithelium, embryo, and ectoplacental cone) and late pregnancy (epithelial cells of the yolk sac and amnion). This pattern indicates that ANG-(1\u20137) participates in the initial events of a pregnancy, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, and growth, and it also plays a role in uteroplacental blood flow during the last phase of gestation (395). In guinea pigs, ANG-(1\u20137) and ACE2 have been detected in the endothelium and syncytiotrophoblast of the labyrinthine placenta, interlobium, subplacenta, giant cells, syncytial sprouts, syncytial streamers, and myometrium throughout pregnancy. Moreover, ANG-(1\u20137) and ACE2 expression were especially notable in giant cells, which also express kallikrein, the bradykinin B2 receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its type 2 receptor, and eNOS, which integrates ANG-(1\u20137) into the uteroplacental vasodilatory network (551). The expression of the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis was also found in two trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo and BeWo cells), reinforcing the idea that ANG-(1\u20137) is involved in the early stages of pregnancy (588). ANG-(1\u20137) treatment attenuated podocyte injuries in cultured podocytes incubated with preeclamptic serum, which demonstrated a decrease in the expression of podocyte-specific proteins (nephrin and WT-1), a rearrangement of F-actin, and apoptosis. These protective effects of ANG-(1\u20137) are probably mediated through the downregulation of MAPK (p38, ERK1/2, and JNK) phosphorylation (539).",

Studies in Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated that these animals exhibited a significant reduction in testis weight and a greater volume of apoptotic cells, giant cells, and vacuoles in the seminiferous epithelium (301). Moreover, Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice also showed lower Sertoli efficiency, meiotic index, overall rate of spermatogenesis, and daily sperm production, indicating the overall importance of MAS in male reproduction (301). Neither ANG-(1\u20137) nor MAS was detected in the seminiferous tubules of infertile men with nonobstructive azoospermia and severely impaired spermatogenesis.

In these conditions, MAS expression in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles was upregulated, as were atrogin-1 and MURF-1. These data and the fact that ANG-(1\u20137) has protective effects against muscle atrophy suggest that MAS is involved in modulating the muscle wasting response (95, 360, 372\u2013375). Mice who are submitted to a unilateral cast immobilization of the hindlimbs for a period of 14 days developed decreased muscle strength; pretreatment with ANG-(1\u20137) improved isometric strength and prevented the decreased fiber diameter of muscle. This also increased atrogin and MuRF1 expression, important markers of muscle atrophy (372). These anti-atrophic effects of ANG-(1\u20137) involve the IGF-1/IGFR-1/AKT pathway as shown by the fact that pretreatment with ANG-(1\u20137) prevents the decrease in AKT phosphorylation and FOXO3. All the effects of ANG-(1\u20137) were absent in Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice, confirming the involvement of MAS in the actions of ANG-(1\u20137) in muscle tissue (372).",

On the other hand, as in other tissues, the axis also has a protective role, delaying the development of hepatic fibrosis (406, 571). Lubel et al. (330) demonstrated that human patients with cirrhosis exhibit markedly elevated levels of concentrations of both plasma ANG-(1\u20137) and ANG II. Furthermore, ANG-(1\u20137) levels were higher in non-cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C than in controls. This study also showed that ANG-(1\u20137) is upregulated in human liver disease and has antifibrotic actions in a rat model of cirrhosis (bile-duct ligation). Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) expressed MAS and when treated with ANG-(1\u20137) or the MAS agonist AVE 0991 produced less \u03b1-SMA and hydroxyproline, which was blocked by the MAS antagonist A-779 (331). In cirrhotic rat liver, ANG-(1\u20137) significantly inhibits vasoconstriction induced by intrahepatic ANG II or the \u03b11 agonist methoxamine (MTX) through eNOS and guanylate cyclase-dependent NO signaling pathways (248). Recently, it has also been demonstrated that ANG-(1\u20137) reduces bile duct ligation-induced hepatic fibrosis via redox balance modulation. ANG-(1\u20137) treatment decreased H2O2 as well as NOX4 and the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is involved in ANG II-stimulated collagen synthesis (62, 632). On the other hand, ANG-(1\u20137) increased glutathione and the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 antioxidant response element (218).",

The increase in NO release is the most classic event related to the protective role of ANG-(1\u20137) and includes calcium-independent pathways and the posttranslational regulation of eNOS (463). ANG-(1\u20137), via AKT-dependent pathways, stimulates eNOS activation (reciprocal phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at Ser1177/Thr495), which triggers NO production (463) and increases levels of cGMP (174, 216, 536). ANG-(1\u20137)-mediated AKT activation is also involved in its metabolic actions and participates in improvements in insulin resistance (205). In addition to the phosphorylation of AKT, ANG-(1\u20137) mediates the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 and AS160, which are crucial insulin mediators (384). It has also been demonstrated that chronic oral administration of HP\u03b2CD-ANG-(1\u20137) attenuates hyperglycemia in an animal model of type 2 diabetes (486), indicating the potential of ANG-(1\u20137) as a hypoglycemic drug.",

It also counterregulates ANG II signaling, blunting the phosphorylation of c-Src and the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase by ANG II and reducing ROS generation (461). This modulatory effect is mediated by the phosphorylation of SHP-2, preventing ANG II-induced SHP-2 dephosphorylation and promoting the interaction between SHP-2 and c-Src (461). Additionally, ANG-(1\u20137) inhibits MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38, JNK), which are central mediators in cell proliferation, fibrosis, and remodeling. The inhibition of these pathways has been demonstrated in a number of cell types including VSMCs (642), lung cancer cells (194, 396), cardiac myocytes (531), endothelial cells (461), and kidney proximal tubule cells (LLC-PK) (199).

The blockade of some functions of ANG-(1\u20137) by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 has been taken as evidence that these receptors are linked (1, 178). This may indicate that some vascular actions of ANG-(1\u20137) depend on protein-protein interactions involved in eNOS activation (283). In addition to caveolin and calmodulin, which undergo reciprocal Ca2+-dependent associations and dissociations with eNOS, the eNOS protein complex includes the B2 receptor and other proteins, including the AT1 receptor, the cationic amino acid transporter-1 arginine transporter, and the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (283). The direct heterodimerization of MAS with the B2 receptor is another possibility to explain the effect of HOE-140. However, the fact that ANG-(1\u20137), through MAS, is capable of producing strong actions in B2-deficient mice demonstrates that these actions of ANG-(1\u20137) are independent of B2 receptors (496).",

Part of the evidence for this has been derived from experiments using the putative AT2 antagonist PD123319 (572). The specificity of this compound has been challenged, however, because it can produce effects in AT2 knockout mice (113), and it can displace the binding of alamandine to human MrgD-transfected cells and the vascular effects of alamandine. On the other hand, MAS appears to heterodimerize with AT2 (572). More reports include a ligand-induced heterodimerization of MAS with endothelin ETB receptors (255). Weak interactions of ANG-(1\u20137) with MrgD receptors have also been described (201). Finally, the heterodimerization of MAS with the AT1 receptor has been reported, and this inhibited the actions of ANG II. In this situation, MAS acts as a physiological antagonist of AT1 (284). These observations are in keeping with the well-known heterodimerization of other GPCRs (173).",

The compelling evidence that the stimulation of the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS axis of the RAS may represent a powerful, novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases and other disorders has motivated many groups to evaluate the role of ANG-(1\u20137) in a range of conditions related to health. In this review we have attempted to highlight relevant aspects of the role of ANG-(1\u20137) in a broad range of physiological and pathophysiological contexts. Ongoing clinical trials based on ACE2- and ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS-related strategies may soon usher in a new chapter of the RAS saga.",

ANG-(1\u20137) improves insulin signaling, increasing AKT phosphorylation, which is a key event for GLUT translocation to membrane and glucose uptake. This effect on AKT is also related to the increase in nitric oxide release and vasodilation. In addition to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, these effects lead to the reduction in microcapillary damage and in the vascular damage. Together, these actions result in clinical benefits, including reduction in cardiomyopathy and nephropathy, decrease in peripheral insulin resistance, protection against eye microcirculation damage, and retinopathy as well as acceleration in wound dermal repair.",

            "text": "FIGURE 11.: Intracellular signaling pathways induced by ANG-(1\u20137). ANG-(1\u20137) mediates, via AKT-dependent pathways, phosphorylation (Ser 1177) and activation of eNOS, stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production. ANG-(1\u20137)-mediated AKT activation is also involved in its metabolic actions, through GLUT phosphorylation and translocation to the membrane, enhancing glucose uptake. Although AKT is an important FOXO inactivator, ANG-(1\u20137) is able to dephosphorylate (Ser256) FOXO1, directly activating this transcription factor. ANG-(1\u20137) also counterregulates ANG II signaling, blunting phosphorylation of c-Src and the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase by ANG II, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This modulatory effect is mediated by phosphorylation of SHP-2, preventing ANG II-induced SHP-2 dephosphorylation and promoting interaction between SHP-2 and c-Src. Additionally, ANG-(1\u20137) inhibits MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and ERK5), central mediators in proliferation, fibrosis, and remodeling. Furthermore, ANG-(1\u20137) inhibits NF-\u03baB, a key transcription factor in inflammation. The signaling pathways elicited by alamandine also involve NO release.",
