The initial descriptions of many of these viruses involved little more than their physical and biochemical characteristics such as diameter, density, and S-value. By the 1970s, many new invertebrate small RNA viruses were being isolated and described and even minimal characterization made it clear that new families of viruses were emerging from this assemblage of small RNA-containing viruses of invertebrates, along with apparent members of existing virus families. Two major families of viruses recognized in the late 1970s and early 1980s were the Tetraviridae and Nodaviridae. Any of the other viruses were simply considered to be \u2018invertebrate picornaviruses\u2019 or \u2018small RNA viruses of insects\u2019.",

At this point, the first full genome sequence of one such invertebrate virus, drosophila C virus (DCV), was published and surprisingly revealed a genome organization strikingly different from the picornaviruses, and indeed quite different from any other viruses known at that time. During the next several years, the genomes of a number of insect small RNA-containing viruses were sequenced and it became clear that two organizational paradigms existed. The first group became the Dicistroviridae while the second has become the (currently) unassigned genus Iflavirus.",

While there are two basic types among the dicistroviruses (Figure 5\n), these are fundamentally the same with six stem\u2013loops \u2013 the most 3\u2032 of which forms a pseudoknot with the codons involved in translation initiation. The initiation of translation is thought to be mediated by the codon which forms the part of the pseudoknot with stem loop VI, immediately upstream of the triplet which encodes the first amino acid of the mature VP2 (Table 3\n). In most cases, the initiation codon is CCU (Pro) while the first codon of VP2 encodes an alanine residue (Table 3).

However, experimental feeding studies indicate that dicistroviruses can be transmissed horizontally. In the case of triatoma virus (TrV) and its host T. infestans, infected insects excrete virus in their feces and since triatomine bugs are coprophagous and TrV is infectious per os, the virus can be readily spread. With DCV, it has been found that when uninfected males are placed with uninfected females, these males become infected (and vice versa). In fact, even if uninfected female flies are placed on media on which infected males have been allowed to feed for several hours, the females become infected. Such manipulations with other virus and invertebrate host systems are not as easy as those involving Drosophila, as it is difficult to obtain colonies free of viruses and the insects are not as easy to manipulate in the laboratory.",

It has been known for some time that the prevalence of a number of honeybee viruses increases in the presence of varroa mites. Initially, it was thought that the stress caused by varroa infestation induced the viruses to replicate. However, recently it has been shown that ABPV and KBV can be detected in mites implicating them more strongly in transmission of the viruses. In contrast, BQCV, although present at high frequency in adult honeybees, has not been detected in mites, suggesting that they play little or no role in transmission.",

Several studies have looked at strain variation between geographic isolates of dicistroviruses using a variety of techniques. CrPV and DCV possess a range of biological and serological characteristics that show differentiation between geographical isolates. With CrPV, two major serogroups have been identified that separate Australian and New Zealand isolates from North American isolates. With DCV, isolates from different localities varied both in their pathogenicity and virus yield after injection into virus-free flies. Additional genetic studies on CrPV and DCV have utilized ribonuclease T1 fingerprinting and subsequently polymerase chain reaction restriction endonuclease analysis. Estimates of the maximum nucleotide divergence between isolates of CrPV and DCV were about 10%. In the case of CrPV, it was found that that the North American isolates were quite distinct from the antipodean isolates, a finding which reflects the serological data.",

In most instances, slightly different regions of the virion protein coding regions (usually regions of VP3) have been used, which makes direct comparison between studies quite difficult. Nevertheless, ABPV isolates show levels of nucleotide identity between 90% and 100%, but isolates from the same geographic region are more closely related than isolates from more distant locations. One such study has revealed that viruses isolated from different central Europe regions were more similar to each other than to isolates from North America or from the UK. Similar patterns are also evident for BQCV and KBV with nucleotide identity within species at 90\u2013100%. To put these values in perspective, the region used for the KBV studies is c. 75% identical to the same region from ABPV.",

Using these data, the phenogram presented as Figure 6\nshows the pattern of relationships and reveals only two closely related pairs of species: CrPV and DCV (which also share a serological relationship) and ABPV and KBV.

In all of the groups mentioned above, the gene order for the nonstructural proteins is the same, viz. Hel-Pro-Rep (as in Figure 4). When compared to other positive-sense viruses, these genes appear to be more closely related to each other than to genes from other viruses, for example, coronaviruses, toroviruses, and tetraviruses. However, there is a subset of the above taxa which shares a larger set of properties: for example, isometric virus particles with pseudo T\n = 3 symmetry (formed of three units of eight-stranded \u03b2-barrel); the absence of sgRNAs during replication; and the presence of a 3\u20134 kDa VPg. On the basis of these properties, the grouping would exclude the Caliciviridae (sgRNAs, large VPg, and true T = 3 symmetry) and the Potyviridae (large VPg, rod-shaped particles with helical symmetry).",
