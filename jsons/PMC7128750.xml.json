            "text": "As the direct cause of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Bcr-Abl is a key therapeutic target. While the catalytic activity of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase is very tightly regulated in vivo (Pendergast, 2002), the chimeric Bcr-Abl protein has constitutively increased tyrosine kinase activity (Konopka and Witte, 1985). c-Abl is regulated through a complex mechanism that includes intramolecular inhibition via the SH3 Barila and Superti-Furga 1998, Brasher et al. 2001, Van Etten et al. 1995 and N-terminal domains (Pluk et al., 2002), regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation Brasher and Van Etten 2000, Dorey et al. 2001, and binding of cellular inhibitors Pendergast et al. 1991a, Wen and Van Etten 1997. Despite almost two decades of intensive research, the mechanism of Abl kinase dysregulation upon fusion with Bcr is not clearly understood. Recently, a small molecule inhibitor of the Abl kinase (imatinib mesylate, formerly STI-571) has been shown to be remarkably effective for induction of hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in CML patients (Kantarjian et al., 2002), but clinical resistance to imatinib treatment is a significant problem (Shah et al., 2002). A better understanding of the regulation of Bcr-Abl catalytic activity is essential for future rational drug development.",

The crystal structure of the Bcr coiled coil has recently been solved (Zhao et al., 2002), and the monomer forms a left-handed \u03b1 helix characterized by a heptad repeat with apolar residues in the first (a) and fourth (d) positions of the repeat. Two monomers associate in an antiparallel dimer that stacks to form a tetramer, consistent with experimental observations. Deletion of the initial 63 amino acids of Bcr or insertion of proline-containing peptides into the \u03b1-helical domain generates Bcr-Abl fusion proteins with decreased in vivo tyrosine kinase activity and impaired induction of anchorage-independent growth in Rat1 fibroblasts (McWhirter et al., 1993). These results suggest that oligomerization of Bcr-Abl increases tyrosine kinase activity and may also mediate other events, such as crosslinking of F-actin (McWhirter and Wang, 1993), which may be essential for transformation and leukemogenesis.",

Fibroblast transformation by Bcr-Abl lacking the coiled-coil domain can be restored by replacement with the leucine zipper domain from GCN4 (McWhirter and Wang, 1997) or a conditional oligomerization motif (K.M.S. and R.A.V., unpublished data), demonstrating that the transforming properties of Bcr-Abl, like c-Abl (Smith and Van Etten, 2001), can be activated by dimerization. Transformation by Bcr-Abl lacking the coiled-coil domain can also be partially restored by deletion of the SH3 domain (Maru et al., 1996). However, there is no direct evidence that oligomerization is the critical function of Bcr sequences in transformation and leukemogenesis by Bcr-Abl, and mechanistic roles for autophosphorylation and the SH3 domain in Bcr-Abl catalytic and biological activity have not been defined.",

To investigate the role of the Bcr coiled-coil domain in regulating catalytic activity, cellular transformation, and leukemogenesis by p210 Bcr-Abl, we generated a series of mutations that are predicted to disrupt the coiled-coil domain while leaving the extreme N terminus of Bcr-Abl intact. p210\u0394cc removes amino acids 31 to 69 and deletes the entire coiled-coil domain (Figure 1C)\n. p210F54P mutates phenylalanine at position 54 to proline (Figure 1G) and is similar to a proline-containing peptide insertion mutant described previously (McWhirter et al., 1993). The F54P mutation places a proline in the middle of the domain and is predicted to disrupt the coiled-coil by introducing a kink to the middle of the \u03b1 helix. The third mutant, p210LZA (Figure 1L), has point mutations at the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d positions across the coiled-coil domain, with Val28, Ile31, Leu35, Ile42, Leu45, Val49, Met56, Leu59, and Leu63 changed to alanine. These point mutations are predicted to conserve the helical structure of the coiled-coil but replace the residues essential for stabilization of the dimer structure. Similar alanine substitution mutations in the leucine zipper domain of murine coronavirus spike protein abolish oligomerization and biological activity (Luo et al., 1999).",

The antibody pEX2 (N) recognizes and immunoprecipitates both full-length and truncated p210 proteins (Figure 2A, lane 2). Strong coassociation of the truncated p210 protein was seen with full-length p210 (Figure 2A) whereas the truncated p210\u0394cc no longer associated with the full-length version. Likewise, coassociation of the full-length and truncated p210 proteins was lost in the presence of either the F54P or LZA mutations.

            "text": "We next assessed the in vivo tyrosine kinase activity of the Bcr-Abl coiled-coil mutant proteins. We transduced interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 hematopoietic cells with BCR-ABL retroviruses, selected G418-resistant populations in the presence of IL-3, and prepared extracts after IL-3 deprivation. The Bcr-Abl coiled-coil mutant proteins were consistently expressed at levels higher than wild-type p210 Bcr-Abl (Figure 3\n, bottom panel), suggesting that oligomerization of Bcr-Abl may affect the stability of the protein in vivo, possibly because activated Abl proteins are more sensitive to proteasomal degradation (Echarri and Pendergast, 2001). Despite higher Bcr-Abl levels, cells expressing p210\u0394cc or p210LZA had greatly decreased levels of phosphotyrosine on cellular proteins compared with wild-type p210-expressing cells (Figure 3, middle panel). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of a 210 kDa species that likely represents Bcr-Abl was moderately decreased in these cells, use of an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Tyr1127 in Bcr-Abl demonstrated that the p210\u0394cc and p210LZA proteins were essentially unphosphorylated at this site (Figure 3, top panel). Phosphorylation at the homologous residue in c-Abl is known to stimulate Abl kinase activity (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000). Surprisingly, the in vivo catalytic activity of p210 was relatively unaffected by the F54P mutation. This appeared to be the consequence of residual oligomerization of this mutant protein, because substitution of alanines for the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d coiled-coil residues of p210F54P resulted in very low kinase activity (Figure 3, compare p210F54P and p210F45P/LZA). These results demonstrate that oligomerization is required for dysregulation of Bcr-Abl kinase activity in vivo.",

To determine whether the in vivo tyrosine kinase activity of oligomerization-defective Bcr-Abl can be restored by loss of SH3 ligand binding function, we generated two additional sets of Bcr-Abl mutants. In the first set, proline 1013 was mutated to leucine to generate p210\u0394cc/P1013L, p210F54P/P1013L, and p210LZA/P1013L (Figures 1E, 1I, and 1N). This mutation, which corresponds to P131L in type Ib/IV c-Abl, has been shown to activate c-Abl kinase and transforming activity and disrupts SH3 function by eliminating proline-rich ligand binding (Van Etten et al., 1995). In a second set of constructs, proline 1124 was mutated to leucine to generate p210\u0394cc/P1124L, p210F54P/P1124L, and p210LZA/P1124L (Figures 1F, 1J, and 1O). The P1124L mutation lies in the linker region between the Abl SH2 and catalytic domains at the site of intramolecular SH3 binding defined in c-Abl, and mutation of the corresponding residue (P242) to alanine or leucine has also been shown to activate the catalytic and transforming activity of type Ib/IV c-Abl Barila and Superti-Furga 1998, Brasher et al. 2001. Addition of either the P1013L or P1124L mutations to p210\u0394cc or p210LZA increased levels of cellular phosphotyrosine to that of wild-type p210-expressing cells without grossly altering the spectrum of phosphorylated proteins (Figure 3), but had little effect on the high constitutive activity of p210F54P. These data demonstrate that loss of SH3 ligand binding function restores maximal in vivo catalytic activity to Bcr-Abl in the absence of oligomerization.",

Deletion of the minimal coiled-coil domain abrogated the ability of p210 Bcr-Abl to transform fibroblasts to anchorage-independent growth (Figure 4A)\n, consistent with previous observations McWhirter et al. 1993, Zhang et al. 2001 and indicating that retention of Bcr amino acids 1\u201330 does not influence transformation. The LZA mutation also significantly reduced transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The p210F54P mutant transformed fibroblasts nearly as efficiently as wild-type p210, but mutation of the hydrophobic leucine zipper residues to alanine (p210F54P/LZA; see Figure 1K) abolished transformation, again suggesting that the F54P point mutation does not completely block oligomerization. When combined with either the P1013L or P1124L mutations, induction of anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts was restored for both the \u0394cc and LZA mutants, while mutation of Pro1013 or Pro1124 had little effect on the robust transforming activity of p210F54P.

Like p210 Bcr-Abl, the p210F54P construct was able to support rapid IL-3-independent growth. In contrast, p210\u0394cc and p210LZA induced greatly diminished proliferation under the same conditions. If followed for an additional 48 hr, cultures expressing p210\u0394cc or p210LZA reached confluence (data not shown), demonstrating that oligomerization of Bcr-Abl enhances IL-3-independent growth but is not absolutely required for transformation of these cells, in agreement with more recent work He et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2001. Mutation of the SH3 domain (P1013L) or the SH2-CD linker (P1124L) in p210\u0394cc and p210LZA resulted in IL-3 independent growth that was comparable to that of cells expressing wild-type p210 (Figures 4C and 4D).

When plated under Whitlock-Witte conditions, p210 Bcr-Abl stimulates the outgrowth of immature B-lymphoid cells that are stroma dependent and not highly leukemogenic in mice (McLaughlin et al., 1987). We have modified this assay to include serial dilution and plating of the transduced bone marrow, which allows for a qualitative assessment of transformation (Figure 5)\n. p210 Bcr-Abl expression resulted in the rapid outgrowth of cultures initiated with as few as 3 \u00d7 103 cells under these conditions (Figure 5A), while only adherent stromal cells were seen in cultures of untransduced cells (Figure 5B). The coiled-coil deletion or alanine substitution mutants were completely defective in this assay, with no detectable growth even at the highest plating density (Figures 5C and 5F). Expression of p210F54P resulted in growth of some wells at higher plating densities, but growth of the lower dilutions was impaired relative to wild-type p210 (Figure 5I), while the p210F54P/LZA double mutant was completely inactive (Figure 5O). Transformation by all three coiled-coil domain mutants was significantly increased by secondary mutations in the SH3 or SH2-CD linker sites, particularly by the P1124L mutation, which restored transformation to the level of wild-type p210 in all cases. Expression of p210Y1294F resulted in modestly decreased cell growth relative to that induced by wild-type p210 (Figure 5M), while the Y1127F and Y1127/1294F mutants showed no growth at any cell plating density (Figures 5L and 5N). These results demonstrate that oligomerization and autophosphorylation are required for transformation of primary B-lymphoid cells by Bcr-Abl. As with fibroblasts and hematopoietic cell lines, oligomerization via the coiled-coil domain can be functionally replaced by SH3 or SH2-CD linker mutations.",

Hence, we tested the ability of the Bcr-Abl coiled-coil mutants to induce CML-like myeloproliferative disease in mice using the bone marrow retroviral transduction/transplantation model. In this assay, mice transplanted with p210-transduced bone marrow stem/progenitor cells from 5-fluorouracil-treated donors develop fatal myeloproliferative disease within 4 weeks posttransplantation (Figure 6)\n, characterized by peripheral blood leukocytosis with greatly increased neutrophils, hepatosplenomegaly, and infiltration of spleen, liver, and lungs with maturing myeloid cells (Li et al., 1999). In contrast, mice transplanted with marrow transduced with p210\u0394cc or p210LZA failed to develop CML-like disease, but instead succumbed to T-lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) after a long latent period (Figures 6A and 6B), characterized by thymic enlargement and circulating CD4/CD8-positive cells (data not shown). Similar T-lymphoma occurs in recipients of marrow expressing Bcr-Abl lacking the entire Bcr N terminus or with a point mutation in the Grb2 binding site at Tyr177 He et al. 2002, Million and Van Etten 2000, Zhang et al. 2001, and results from transduction of T-lymphoid progenitors in the donor bone marrow. Recipients of marrow transduced with p210F54P developed rapidly fatal acute B-lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL) characterized by moderate splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, normal thymus, and a hemorrhagic malignant pleural effusion that was the cause of death (Figure 6C). The same disease is induced by p210 Bcr-Abl with a point mutation in the SH2 domain that impairs catalytic activity (Roumiantsev et al., 2001). These results demonstrate that efficient oligomerization through the coiled-coil domain and maximal levels of Bcr-Abl kinase activity are required for induction of CML.",

These mice had normal lymph nodes and thymus and no evidence of B- or T-lymphoid malignancy based on histopathological and flow cytometric analysis (data not shown). This result is consistent with the induction of CML-like disease by p210 with deletions in both the coiled-coil and SH3 domains (Zhang et al., 2001) and implicates directly the ligand binding function of the SH3 domain in the rescue mechanism. The P1124L SH2-CD linker mutation also restored induction of CML-like disease by p210\u0394cc although less efficiently (Figure 6A). Likewise, mutation at either Pro1013 or Pro1124 restored induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease by p210LZA (Figure 6B). Two recipients of p210LZA/P1013L-transduced marrow succumbed to myeloproliferative disease but with longer latency compared to mice receiving either p210- or p210\u0394cc/P1013L-transduced marrow, suggesting that the SH3 point mutation complements this particular coiled-coil domain mutation inefficiently, as it does for B-lymphoid transformation (Figure 5G). The P1124L mutation rescued p210LZA more effectively, with five of seven recipients developing CML-like disease and the remaining two animals developing T-ALL and histiocytic sarcoma (HS), another Bcr-Abl-induced hematologic malignancy that can develop in transplant recipients after long latent periods (Li et al., 1999). Interestingly, the P1013L mutation also partially rescued induction of myeloproliferative disease by p210F54P, with three of eight recipients developing typical CML-like disease and one succumbing to simultaneous CML and B-ALL. The remaining mice in this cohort had myeloproliferative disease with splenomegaly and peripheral blood leukocytosis, but eventually succumbed to T-lymphoma or HS. Together, these results argue that oligomerization of Bcr-Abl via the coiled-coil domain is required for induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease in mice, but disruption of the SH3 domain ligand binding function or a complementary mutation in the intramolecular SH3 binding site can compensate for defects in oligomerization.",

Single mutation of the homolog of the c-Abl secondary autophosphorylation site in the SH2-CD linker (Y1127F) had no effect on leukemogenesis, but p210 lacking both potential autophosphorylation sites (p210Y1127/1294F) was severely impaired for induction of CML-like disease, with the majority of mice lacking evidence of myeloproliferative disease and developing T-lymphoma (Figure 6D).

This deficiency in part reflected our limited understanding of the control of c-Abl catalytic activity, but several recent studies have begun to clarify this. A critical component of the c-Abl regulatory mechanism is shared with Src kinases: the Abl SH3 domain binds to a single proline (Pro242 in type Ib/IV c-Abl) in the SH2-CD linker that is conserved in Src family members. Mutations in SH3 that block ligand binding or mutation of the Pro242 SH3 binding site dysregulate c-Abl kinase activity in vivo and in vitro Barila and Superti-Furga 1998, Brasher et al. 2001, Van Etten et al. 1995. Enzymological studies of purified c-Abl have shown that Abl can undergo intermolecular autophosphorylation at two distinct regulatory tyrosines, Tyr412 and Tyr245 (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000). Phosphorylation of Tyr412 in the kinase domain activation loop stimulates Abl kinase activity and induces rapid phosphorylation at Tyr245, which may displace the SH3 domain from the adjacent Pro242 site, and results in a highly active enzyme with activity equivalent to SH3-mutated c-Abl. Physiological activation of c-Abl may involve auto- or trans-phosphorylation of Tyr412, perhaps by a Src family kinase (Plattner et al., 1999), followed by loss of self-inhibition by the SH3 domain.",

            "text": "Although the SH3 domains of Abl and Src carry out similar autoinhibitory functions, the two kinases differ in one important regulatory feature. A C-terminal phosphotyrosine in Src family kinases (Tyr527 in c-Src) functions as an intramolecular SH2 domain binding site (Sicheri et al., 1997) and is required for proper regulation of kinase activity. c-Abl is unphosphorylated in its inactive state (Van Etten et al., 1995) and, lacking this SH2-C-terminal interaction, employs other mechanisms to stabilize its inactive conformation. In the case of type Ib c-Abl, recent studies demonstrate that sequences N-terminal to the SH3 domain (the N-terminal \u201ccap\u201d) bind to the Abl catalytic domain (Pluk et al., 2002) and are required along with the N-terminal myristoyl group (Hantschel et al., 2003) for proper regulation of Abl kinase activity upon overexpression in vivo. The structural role of the Abl N terminus was revealed in a striking crystallographic study that demonstrated an interaction of the myristoyl group with the C-terminal lobe of the Abl catalytic domain (Nagar et al., 2003). Binding of the myristoyl group induces a conformational change that permits the docking of the SH2 domain with the noncatalytic face of the C-lobe in a fashion that closely resembles the inactive conformation of Src. Together, these studies suggest that there may be several routes to activation of c-Abl through displacement of either the myristoyl group, the SH3 domain, or the SH2 domain. However, there are several features of c-Abl that are unaccounted for by this model. When expressed at physiological levels, type Ia c-Abl is regulated despite the lack of a myristoyl group, as is a c-Abl Ib mutant lacking the myristoylation site and first 45 residues of the cap (Franz et al., 1989). In addition, there is evidence that c-Abl is also regulated in vivo by phosphoinositide lipids (Plattner et al., 2003) and protein inhibitors (Wen and Van Etten, 1997). Thus, further studies are necessary before we will have a complete understanding of c-Abl regulation.",

Relative to c-Abl, the Bcr-Abl fusion protein retains the Abl SH3 domain but lacks Abl first exon sequences and myristoylation and has gained the coiled-coil domain. A simple model suggested that oligomerization through the Bcr coiled-coil domain might constitutively dysregulate the Abl kinase. While deletion of the Bcr coiled-coil domain decreases kinase activity and transformation by Bcr-Abl (McWhirter et al., 1993), the underlying mechanism was not known. Using novel Bcr coiled-coil mutants, we have provided direct evidence that oligomerization of Bcr-Abl is the important kinase-activating function of the coiled-coil domain. The Bcr-Abl coiled-coil deletion and alanine substitution mutants failed to oligomerize, were defective for transformation of fibroblasts and primary B-lymphoid cells, and were unable to induce CML-like myeloproliferative disease in mice. The low but detectable in vivo tyrosine kinase of monomeric Bcr-Abl may reflect loss of a portion of the Abl N-terminal cap and the myristoyl group. The p210F54P mutant exhibited significant in vivo kinase and cell transforming activity that likely reflects residual oligomerization undetected by our stringent coimmunoprecipitation assay, because the p210F54P/LZA double mutant had low kinase activity and was completely defective for transformation. Phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl at two key regulatory tyrosines is both dependent on oligomerization and required for leukemogenesis, demonstrating that the critical event induced by Bcr-Abl oligomerization is likely to be intermolecular autophosphorylation.",

We demonstrated that in vivo kinase activity, cellular transformation, and leukemogenesis by the Bcr-Abl coiled-coil deletion and alanine substitution mutants were restored by a point mutation (P1013L) in the Abl SH3 domain that disrupts proline-rich ligand binding or by a complementary mutation (P1124L) in the SH2-CD linker region at the site of intramolecular SH3 binding defined in c-Abl (Barila and Superti-Furga, 1998). Thus, Bcr-Abl is still autoregulated via its SH3 domain despite the lack of myristoylation, and cannot induce CML unless this inhibition is overcome through oligomerization and transphosphorylation or by SH3 mutation. It has been postulated that oligomerization of Bcr-Abl by the coiled-coil domain might contribute to the pathogenesis of CML through mechanisms other than direct effects on Bcr-Abl kinase activity, such as crosslinking of F-actin microfilaments (McWhirter and Wang, 1993). However, our results demonstrate that Bcr-Abl can induce CML-like disease independent of oligomerization when released from its autoinhibited state by other means.",

            "text": "Taken together, these observations suggest that an elegant and simple mechanism governs Bcr-Abl catalytic activity (Figure 7)\n. Our results argue that Bcr-Abl can assume an inactive state where the enzyme is monomeric and unphosphorylated. The primary consequence of oligomerization of Bcr-Abl is intermolecular autophosphorylation at Tyr1294 in the activation loop of the catalytic domain. As in c-Abl (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000), Tyr1294 phosphorylation may lead to secondary phosphorylation events, including phosphorylation of Tyr1127, the homolog of c-Abl Tyr245, which results in displacement of the SH3 domain from the SH2-CD linker. The order of phosphorylation may not be obligatory, as autophosphorylation of the linker tyrosine in both c-Abl and Bcr-Abl can occur when the activation loop tyrosine is mutated (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000; Figure 3). Enzymological studies of purified Bcr-Abl proteins should be helpful in confirming this model. While there are additional tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Bcr-Abl and c-Abl, our results suggest that Tyr1294 and Tyr1127 are the major sites that influence the regulation of catalytic activity in both enzymes. Other phosphorylation sites may contribute to leukemogenesis by Bcr-Abl independent of any role in autoregulation, as is the case with Tyr177, which forms a binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2 and is required for induction of CML-like leukemia by Bcr-Abl (Million and Van Etten, 2000).",

            "text": "There are several features of Bcr-Abl regulation yet unaccounted for by this model. The Abl SH2 domain seems to play a positive role in activation of Bcr-Abl catalytic activity, as deletions or point mutations in SH2 decrease Bcr-Abl kinase activity in vitro and in vivo (Roumiantsev et al., 2001) and impair Bcr-Abl transformation and leukemogenesis Pendergast et al. 1991b, Roumiantsev et al. 2001. The precise mechanism of SH2-dependent activation of Bcr-Abl is not known but has been suggested to involve SH2 binding to phosphoserine residues C-terminal to the coiled-coil domain in Bcr (Pendergast et al., 1991b). However, if the similarity between the autoinhibited conformations of Bcr-Abl and c-Abl extends to the SH2 domain, then SH2 should be docked to the C-lobe of the kinase domain when Bcr-Abl is monomeric, and might participate in kinase activation through binding of phosphotyrosine ligands (Hantschel et al., 2003). Testing the effect of mutations in SH2 that are predicted to disrupt H-bonding with the kinase domain C-lobe (Hantschel et al., 2003) on the activity of monomeric Bcr-Abl might clarify the role of SH2. There is also a discrepancy in the oncogenic activity of one of the mutants, p210Y1127F, which was completely defective for transformation of early B-lymphoid progenitors but readily induced myeloproliferative disease when expressed in hematopoietic stem cells. Other Bcr-Abl mutations, for example in the SH2 domain (Roumiantsev et al., 2001), also differentially affect lymphoid and myeloid leukemogenesis. In the case of p210Y1127F, it is possible that phospho-Tyr1127 forms a binding site for an SH2-containing protein that is critical for B-lymphoid transformation but not induction of CML.",

            "text": "Our results have important implications for the mechanism of inhibition of Bcr-Abl by imatinib (STI-571). Structural (Schindler et al., 2000) and enzymatic (Roumiantsev et al., 2002) studies have demonstrated that imatinib preferentially binds to and inhibits the unphosphorylated form of c-Abl. It is very likely that the autoinhibited form of Bcr-Abl we have postulated is also the imatinib-sensitive state of the fusion protein. As equilibrium may exist in vivo between the inactive and active states of Bcr-Abl depicted in Figure 7, imatinib probably acts to trap the enzyme in the autoinhibited, unphosphorylated state (Roumiantsev et al., 2002). Oligomerization of Bcr-Abl and activation of the enzyme through intermolecular autophosphorylation would force the catalytic domain into an open, activated conformation that is inconsistent with binding the phenylaminopyrimidine pharmacophore of the drug. Our studies predict that mutations in Bcr-Abl that impair its ability to assume the autoinhibited conformation, such as those we have defined in the SH3 and SH2-CD linker regions, would tend to drive the enzyme toward the activated state in vivo and could be associated with clinically significant resistance to imatinib. Interestingly, a recent random, unbiased screen for mutations in Bcr-Abl that confer imatinib resistance recovered mutations in the SH3 domain (including P1013Q) that are predicted to abolish ligand binding and in the SH2-CD linker adjacent to Pro1124 (Azam et al., 2003). The authors inferred from these mutants that Bcr-Abl has an autoregulated state that is similar to c-Abl, and our results provide direct proof of this hypothesis. In theory, the same mutations might contribute to the progression of chronic phase CML to blast crisis by increasing in vivo kinase activity of Bcr-Abl. Indeed, some Abl kinase domain mutations found in patients with advanced CML and acquired resistance to imatinib are present at significant frequency in leukemic cells prior to initiation of therapy (Shah et al., 2002), suggesting that these mutations may be selected for during CML disease progression. Last, these results emphasize the need for crystal structures of both full-length c-Abl and Bcr-Abl, both to illuminate the mechanisms of Abl kinase regulation and to guide future rational drug development. Our studies also validate the development of small molecule inhibitors of Bcr-Abl oligomerization as potential therapeutic agents for CML.",

In its monomeric form, Bcr-Abl is unphosphorylated and the Abl SH3 domain interacts with the linker region between the SH2 and catalytic domains. This form of the enzyme binds efficiently to imatinib (shown in orange). Upon oligomerization, a primary phosphorylation event at Tyr1294 is rapidly followed by secondary phosphorylation at Tyr1127, which disrupts the SH3-linker interaction and results in full catalytic activity. In the absence of oligomerization via the coiled-coil domain, kinase and transformation activities can be restored by mutations in the SH3 domain that disrupt ligand binding or by complementary mutation of the SH3 ligand in the SH2-CD linker region. For simplicity, other phosphorylation sites including Tyr177 in Bcr are not shown.",
