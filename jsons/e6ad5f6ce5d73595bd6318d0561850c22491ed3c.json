As the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the state of Michigan, there was a rapid increase in COVID-19 positive patients within the health system, with an accordant increase in COVID-19 suspected and positive inpatient and emergency department (ED) consultations. Thus, on March 16, 2020, the decision was made to implement a new Urology Consultation Triage Pathway (Figure 1). Briefly, all consultations for the Urology service were assessed based on clinical context (complexity and time-sensitivity of urological issue/s), resources available with the consulting teams to address minor urological issues, and the COVID-19 status of the patient (confirmed, suspected, not suspected) at time of consultation. Patients were then triaged into one of three pathways: 1) Telemedicine: Patients with non-urgent/non-emergent inpatient issues were managed with telemedicine consultation composed of chart review and discussion with primary team providers, with or without patient telephone interview (depending upon patient's clinical status). These patients could be COVID-19 positive, suspected or negative. 2) Standard: Patients with urgent/emergent inpatient needs but not proven/suspected COVID-19 positive had standard Urology consultation (though still minimizing the number of urology residents and/or attendings involved in direct patient care).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "A prospective database was maintained for this period, tracking the management of patients in each of the three triage pathways. Data were collected for a three-week period (from March 16, 2020 to April 2, 2020), and analyzed between April 4 and April 7, 2020. Data points included age, sex, race, pertinent medical/surgical history, primaryhospital diagnosis and consulting service. Management and treatment variables included reason for consultation, type of consultation performed, intervention performed, and COVID-19 status (at time of consultation and final). Interventions were defined as non-procedural recommendations (medication and/or planned follow-up), operative procedure, bedside procedures (catheter placement or change, cystoscopy, incision and drainage, penile injections/aspiration/irrigation, etc.), or Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures. In order to compare consultation workflow in the period preceding the implementation of the pathway, similar data points were extracted for all urology consultations for the month of March 2019 (March 1, 2019 to March 31, 2019). This latter cohort served as a control group, with no ongoing regional or national health care stressors. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test (with Yates correction for n<5) or Fisher's exact test as appropriate, and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were done using MS Excel version 15 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and IBM SPSS version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY). The study was approved by the International Review Board committee and exempted from informed consent under local institutional protocols. Results Table 1 shows the demographics and consultation characteristics of urology consultations during the specified time periods. A total of 154 consultations were analyzed, 101 consultations from March 2019 and 53 from March 2020. The median age, sex, race and consulting service were similar between the groups. The most common reasons for consultation were hematuria, urinary retention and kidney stones and this was not significantly different between the 2019 and 2020 groups (p=0.2). A greater proportion of patients were managed non-procedurally in March 2020 compared to March 2019 (66 vs 51.5%), with fewer patients undergoing operative intervention (consultations were performed. In March 2020, following implementation of our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-risk, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "None of the residents or faculty caring for urology consultation patients during the March 2020 period developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and/or tested positive for it.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "depicts the number of COVID positive patients admitted to our hospital over the study period, as well as, the number of Standard, Telemedicine, and High-Risk consultations performed on each day after the triage pathway was implemented.CommentIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, all aspects of medical and surgical patient care have been transformed. Because a significant proportion of COVID-19 infections are caused by undocumented exposure(5), decreasing in-person contact with ED and hospitalized patients is of utmost importance. The described consultation triage pathway allows for necessary urgent and emergent urologic care, while minimizing exposure that would be associated with standard urology consultations.During the March 2020 study period, we managed over half of all consultations (54.7%) using a modified consultation type (Telemedicine or High-risk), and for some days, the majority of consultations were managed using Telemedicine alone.Importantly, demographics and consultation characteristics, with the exception of primary hospital diagnosis, were not significantly different in March 2019 and March 2020, suggesting that March 2020 (other than the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic), represented a typical month of urologic consultations. More consults during 2020 had a primary pulmonary diagnosis, likely reflecting the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, fewer consults in March 2020, 5/53 (9.4%), resulted in operative intervention compared to 22/101 (21.7%) consults in March 2019. This can, in part, be attributed to the Henry Ford Health System policy enacted on March 15 2020, which postponed all non-time sensitive surgeries. Unsurprisingly, more patients were managed with non-procedural recommendations and IR procedures in March 2020, which likely reflects both departmental and hospital-wide efforts to preserve operating room space and all associated resources.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "The authors recognize that by using this pathway, there may be a suggestion of decreased value associated with some urology consultations. In addition to urologicprocedures and recommendations, urologists provide reassurance about and explanations for urologic problems, while facilitating and encouraging outpatient followup.
