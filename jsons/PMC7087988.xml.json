As noted by Allen (2004), the dominant approach to community food security in the US has primarily been to link sustainable agriculture and hunger at the community level (Allen 1999; Anderson and Cook 1999; Community Food Security Coalition). Drawing upon research conducted in BC, this paper suggests another direction and focus. It illustrates a lesser focus on hunger or food insecurity, but rather a new concern about the public\u2019s health. Agriculture or hunger is not excluded, but instead health is proposed as a driver in food security and food systems. The proposal of health as a driver fits the intellectual framework argued by others such as MacRae (1999) and Lang (2005a). In fact, this article also proposes that the focus on health returns to the 1930s notion of a marriage between health and agriculture\u2014where interest in the public\u2019s health drove the creation of agricultural policy, and where the government was a key player in policy-making.",

The BC food security experience brings together local, decentralized, bottom up approaches and government, centralized, top down approaches, with the top down thrust coming from the BC Provincial Government. The melding of both of these directions builds on the Bellows and Hamm (2003) contention of conflicting trends of decentralization and centralization occurring in food security since the Second World War. Their argument is also advanced by this paper, in that both top down government intervention and bottom up civil society engagement are likely to be required in achieving food security. Moreover, many of the challenges within the incorporation of programs into the government are microcosms of higher level tensions played out at international levels.",

First, the scope and means (e.g., policy instruments) of food security policy in the BC government are analyzed by contrasting and comparing them to the Hamm and Bellows\u2019 (2003) definition of community food security.2 Next, the research utilizes Lang\u2019s (2005b) simple food policy triangle (Fig. 1), which proposes a starting point for food policy as a contested space between stakeholders from government, civil society, and the food supply chain. Using the triangle and the sectors within it, the research examines relationships between the stakeholders and institutions, and explores the distribution of power between them.\n",

However, in comparison to current global food security movements, it is important to note that this movement occurred at an international institutional, not at a civil society level. The \u201cworld food movement\u201d built on the work of British physician and scholar, Boyd Orr, who first established food security as a determinant of health by linking nutrition and income (Cepede undated; Diouf undated; Orr 1936; Ostry 2006). During the Great Depression, despite international agricultural surpluses\u2014which were often dumped or destroyed (Boudreau 1947; United Nations, undated)\u2014farmers and agriculture suffered as prices of food and other commodities fell to a point at which there was little profit in production (Akroyd in Passmore 1980). Moreover, as some populations suffered from hunger or malnutrition, \u201chunger in the midst of plenty\u201d became a contemporary phrase (Akroyd in Boudreau 1947; Passmore 1980; Turnell 2000). Restriction of world food production was suggested as a solution, to which some were appalled (Cepede, undated; Passmore 1980). Instead, a \u201cnutrition approach\u201d to world agriculture was proposed (Turnell 2000). The \u201cnutrition approach\u201d brought forth the concept of a \u201cmarriage of health and agriculture,\u201d linking nutrition and the public\u2019s health (consumption) to the food supply (production) (Passmore 1980). The situation of \u201chunger in the midst of plenty\u201d was a concern for the League on humanitarian grounds, but also because of the potential effect upon the social structure and internal peace of concerned countries (League of Nations 1937). The Second World War broke out soon after, bringing these efforts of the League of Nations to an end (Hambidge 1955; Orr 1943).3\n",

The contention of this paper that in order to achieve food security, aspects of a centralized/top down/government intervention and decentralized/bottom up/grassroots interventions are both required is consistent with Lang\u2019s model of food policy. Lang outlines government, civil society, and the food supply chain as all central to food policy (2005b). Further, as will be proposed in the discussion, the current situation is likely more nuanced than a polarized argument of centralization and decentralization.",

As noted previously, when defining food security, stakeholders from Public Health utilized the Hamm and Bellows\u2019 definition of community food security or a slight variation of it. Further, the Public Health Core Program in Food Security also framed food security comprehensively (Provincial Health Services Authority 2007a). However, in practice Public Health\u2019s administrators felt pressured to meet individual human health outcomes, and thus Public Health initiatives focused on that aspect of the definition. Civil society food security networks focused more on the food system, while civil society health NGOs centered either on food insecurity/hunger or on the public\u2019s health. Few within the food supply chain utilized the term \u201cfood security,\u201d but were committed to issues of food security nonetheless. Agendas varied dependent on the stakeholder, but many focused on food safety and the promotion of BC agriculture. The identification of agendas is salient in both the analysis of stakeholder relationships and in the articulation of future recommendations.\n",

The integration of food security as a Public Health Core Program was cited as one of the biggest successes of all of the initiatives by close to one-quarter of the interviewees. The Community Food Action Initiative was credited in creating the first ongoing provincial table on food security. These two programs also spurred the hiring of food security coordinators in all of the Regional Health Authorities, and they obliged Health Authorities to comply with performance requirements associated with each. The fact that such a relatively high number of food security initiatives was introduced\u2014by Public Health and through the cross-ministry ActNow BC initiative\u2014supports the legitimization within the government. Interviewees also suggested that Public Health involvement and funding to local initiatives from the Community Food Action Initiative increased the legitimacy of food security at the community and municipal levels. Nonetheless, food security is still acknowledged as a low priority within the government. The dilution of food insecurity (hunger) within the agenda was another consequence. Food insecurity is included only weakly in the initiatives. For example, the provincial school meal program\u2014a major food security program\u2014was not included as part of the new funding thrust. Where food insecurity is addressed in BC reports, it is approached from a preventive, anti-poverty lens (Dietitians of Canada and Community Nutritionists Council of British Columbia 2006; Provincial Health Officer 2006; Provincial Health Services Authority 2007b). However, in programs the approach is primarily food-centered, and through alleviation. Interviewees see that a broader food security agenda has the potential to both pave the way for hunger to be incorporated and to deter from the broader issues. Conflict over if and how to address food insecurity existed among stakeholders, and numerous barriers to inclusion were identified. Recommendations for moving the agenda forward included: studying the links between food security and food insecurity (using dialogue between stakeholders); completing cost analysis on the health impacts of food insecurity; following through with recommendations from existing reports; and researching other effective models.",

The rise of decentralization, in the form of increased civil society NGO participation\u2014both internationally and at the local level\u2014is a key component driving the need for reconfiguration. Within the context of globalization, civil society has an increasing understanding and awareness of the impacts of broader, centralized decisions on their personal and community food security. Civil society has thus assumed a greater voice and is increasingly engaged in food security, in some cases demanding the right to control their food supply and food systems. Further, they recognize that they may have more success in shifting the status quo by working with government\u2014a lesson observed recently in successful municipal food policy initiatives. The fact that civil society and government employees had a strong history of working together on food security in BC facilitated the integrated top down/bottom up approach seen in the initiatives under review.

It calls for greater engagement of civil society and for all sectors to work together toward common goals. Gunningham and Sinclair (2002, p. 193) suggest that \u201cregulatory pluralism\u201d occurs when the \u201cgovernment harness(es) the capacities of markets, civil society, and other institutions to accomplish its policy goals more effectively, with greater social acceptance, and at less cost to the state.\u201d The integration in BC described here could be argued to exemplify an undertaking on the cutting edge in progress toward reconfiguration. Specifically, the ActNow BC declaration that all ministries and to some extent industry need to work toward a greater goal of the public\u2019s health in order to address upwardly spiraling health care costs is an example of a redesign of the role of government. However, this is only a beginning, as civil society food security networks in BC would argue that their goals\u2014and meaningful participation\u2014need to be integrated into government goals in reconfiguration. Their marginalization in a process that they were instrumental in initiating suggests a lag in a shift toward \u201cregulatory pluralism and cultural recognition.9 Both food policy (Koc et al. 2008) and business (Porter and Kramer 2011) literature support the adoption of the concept of regulatory pluralism and creating shared values. Moving toward \u201cregulatory pluralism\u201d would require the government to commit to a greater engagement of civil society in BC. Possible approaches toward greater engagement outlined in this research include: supporting capacity building for civil society, finding ways to share power, articulation of agendas and limitations, and a more conciliatory approach from civil society. Correspondingly, MacRae outlines ways to engage a wider range of actors in food policy at federal, provincial, and municipal government levels. These include, but are not limited to: broadened participation in advisory councils, bringing civil society organizations into governance models, creating provincial networks of municipal food policy councils, and undertaking joint programming with civil society organizations (MacRae 2011). However, echoing BC\u2019s experience, he states \u201calthough new forms of regulatory pluralism are emerging, it is not obvious that governments and food system actors are skilled at, or committed to, their implementation\u201d (MacRae 2011, p. 431). Further, he suggests that while regulatory pluralism can \u201coffer short term opportunities to widen the set of actors who participate in policy development,\u201d it does not preclude or replace longer term significant structural change needed to enact comprehensive Canadian food policy (MacRae 2011, p. 453).",

Ecological, holistic models of policy making do not appear to be well established in literature, and the Ritchie and Spencer model was useful both in framing research questions and analysis. Personal communication with Ritchie (2011) suggests that this research may be one of the first documented uses of the model in structuring analysis. Further, the researcher suggests that the Ritchie and Spencer model could be applied to analyzing policy in progress. An ecological, holistic approach to research also builds on Caraher\u2019s (2008) recommendations regarding evaluation, suggesting that more attention be given to the evaluation of a collection of initiatives and resources and not simply to individual programs. Finally, an emerging, more sophisticated model of Lang\u2019s food policy triangle (2005) for the analysis of food security dynamics is outlined by this research. The following is a summary of the core findings from the research.Public Health has re-emerged as a driver in food security and food policy.Agendas of those in power (rather than definitions) determine strategies.Competing agendas highlighted the relative insignificance of food security initiatives under investigation.Lang\u2019s triangle model is too crude; a more sophisticated model was generated from the research (Fig. 2)Relationships between government, civil society, and food supply chain stakeholders need to be reconfigured toward regulatory pluralism in order to work together more effectively to advance food security.Marginalization of civil society and Community Nutritionist stakeholders from involvement in the provincial level restricted the broad source of expertise that informed the integration and the political base for further integration.Arguments for food security could be better positioned within current Provincial Government agendas and should include corresponding options for policy alternatives.Ritchie and Spencer\u2019s categories of applied policy research are applicable in the retrospective analysis of processes in food security and food policy\n",
