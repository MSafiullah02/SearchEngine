Economic theory has long suggested that people may alter behavior to avoid becoming sick.(1, 2) Yet, many people are under government orders to reduce time in public involuntarily. As governments begin to ease these restrictions, it is important to disentangle the extent that the observed shifts in behavior are voluntary. This information is critical for assessing the epidemiological risk and potential short-run economic benefits of relaxing stay-at-home orders. The United States provides a good case study because all 50 States and the District of Colombia in the United States have issued emergency orders, and 40 (39 States and the District of Colombia) have issued stay-at-home orders. However, stay-at-home orders were not all issued at the same time or in response to the same number of reported cases ( Figure 1 ).",

This behavior is largely crowded out and replaced by state-of-emergency orders, though stay-at-home orders lead to substantially more time spent at home. Americans also respond to local and national information differently. Those living in well-connected metro counties put greater weight on national information than those is remote and less connected non-metro counties. The voluntary response to COVID-19 cases and deaths locally and nationally suggests that relaxing restrictions and relying on greater voluntary action carries some risk, but we should not expect people to revert to pre-epidemic behavioral patterns. However, relying on voluntary behavior depends on clear and accurate information and consistent messaging. : medRxiv preprint During the 2003 SARS epidemic, people in Beijing and Hong Kong took voluntary actions to avoid public places with tourism as well as local and international transport. (3, 4) A survey in England, Scotland and Wales found 38% of the participants practicing recommended behavior with a subset practicing avoidance behavior during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.(5) Empirical evidence from the 2009 H1N1 shows that Americans reduced the amount of time spent in public voluntarily enough to have affected peak prevalence and cumulative H1N1 cases. (6, 7) Early evidence from the current pandemic supports the theory that people take defensive action to avoid illness. (8, 9) US states declared a series of orders to keep people home and encourage physical (social) distancing. We explore emergency and stay at home orders, which include shelter-in-place orders. The implementation of the state-of-emergency declaration and the stay-at-home, including shelter-in-place, order vary over time (",

This preparation event may have led to more transmission undermining the very goal of distancing policies.

We focus on case reports, because are correlated with death reports (Table   S1 and S2).

It would take 10 additional local county cases reports to exceed the corresponding response in a metropolitan county with 299.36 (CI: 93.11, 561.71) mins. The response to national reports in a non-metro county was half of the corresponding response in a metropolitan county.

We use the regression results to predict the counterfactual time at home in the absence of both orders ( Figure   4 ). Americans in both types of counties exhibited voluntary avoidance behavior in response to the COVID19 pandemic. Voluntary behavior would have led to about a 200-minute increase in time spent at home conditional on the case trajectory, with the order adding about another 150-200 minutes. However, if Americans had spent less time at home, then there may have been more cases and more death, which could have led to a stronger avoidance response than the current prediction. Yet, given testing constraints, it is unlikely more cases would have been reported, and there is mounting evidence that the number of cases is many times the reported amount. (12, 13) Our results show that Americans have increased time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic and that a non-trivial share of this response was voluntary. Governments have imposed restrictive policies to encourage distancing during this pandemic. Now some governments are considering relaxing some of these restrictions. It is important to understand the individual actions that people take to protect themselves from risk in order to understand the public health benefit and tradeoffs of such policies.",

Counties were classified as metropolitan or non-metropolitan following the US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service classification. Data on time spent at home is based on anonymized and aggregated mobile device location data from SafeGraph. (17) We used two distinct but related products to quantify behavior during the epidemic. First, we used median home dwell time reported at the Census block group on each day. Dwell time is the time that a device is present within a home. We aggregated to the county and normalize visitation by the devices present in the home summarized at the county level. The normalization was required to compare estimates over time as the panel of devices changes over time. Finally, we construct a set of county-level weather controls by aggregating 4km gridded estimates of maximum and minimum daily temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, precipitation amount, surface sun radiation, and wind speed.

We use Manski's partial-identification strategy to estimate the response to national case reports and policies conditional on the lower bound effect of county case (or death) reports. (19) Since the response to county case reports is the main voluntary behavioral effect, this gives us a conservative measure of the role voluntary behavior.
